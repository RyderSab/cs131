US	46160224	R3OFYHEZ0CDNIC	0553110721	698766211	Dune: House Harkonnen	Books	2	3	5	N	Y	The weakest of the three	I liked House Atreides and House Corrino pretty well (especially House Atreides).  House Harkonnen left me unimpressed.  It got bogged down in a lot of nonessentials and simply did not seem to go anywhere.  Nor does the novel ever explain how Gurney Halleck became a competent swordsman/warmaster on a par with Duncan Idaho.  I just didn't get it.<br /><br />The parts about Emperor Shaddam were interesting, and of course Duke Leto Atreides is unforgettable.  But overall this one is the weakest of the three in the Prequel to Dune series.  I do like the prequel trilogy, just not this component of it.	2005-10-03

In this novel, the Emperor Shaddam Corrino tries to conclude his plan to remake the Galactic Imperium through his secret artificial spice project.  House Atreides secures its position as Duke Leto gains experience as the Duke of Caladan.  Overall, this is a very interesting storyline that holds the reader's interest and leads up to the original Dune novel theme.  A book that can do all that is not unimpressive.<br /><br />In fact, House Corrino does a fair job of explaining the inner workings of the Galactic Imperium--better than Dune itself did.  The reader learns a great deal about House-to-House warfare, the strictures of kanly, and other elements of the Dune universe which the original Dune novel really only just touched upon.  The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, similarly, springs to life in this novel.<br /><br />I went back and forth between three stars and four, but ultimately went with four stars because this book passed one of my major tests: I enjoyed reading it the second time as much as the first.  This is a genuine story of political intrigue that is internally consistent, features decent character development (perhaps even better than Frank Herbert achieved in Dune; character development was never one of Frank Herbert's major strengths.)<br /><br />Overall this is an engaging novel that Dune enthusiasts won't want to pass up.  I thought it was clearly better than the sequels to Dune that Frank Herbert himself wrote.	2005-10-02

It is eminently readable, well-organized, and gives the reader a clear idea of what to do and what not to do as regards raising Dragons.  These animals have become very popular as pets in many parts of the world due to their cool appearance, nice personalities, and hardiness.  This book gives the reader pretty much what he or she needs to know in selecting and caring for a Bearded Dragon.  Although much of this information can be found for free on the Internet, I nevertheless enjoyed reading this book and I did learn some new things about caring for dragons. Further, some of the information on the Internet is either wrong, or at least controversial.  This book derives its sources from qualified veterinarians and naturalists.<br /><br />One of the things I really like about this book is the \\"FAQ\\" (Frequently Asked Questions) that appear throughout the text.  These are generally Q & As to common problems and errors in raising Bearded Dragons.  I wish I had had this book when I first got my Beardie; I made one or two of the errors that this book warns about.<br /><br />If you are going to buy one book about caring for Bearded Dragons, this one is the one to get.  It is also a fun read.	2005-10-02

Prior to this, Germany, Britain, and the Soviet Union, while lacking America's military might, were all far more competent militarily than was the United States, largely due to America's essential pacifism, and the warlike nature of the other Great Powers.  Prior to the North African campaign, Britain had been fighting alone in the west, while the Soviet Union was locked in a death struggle with Nazi Germany.<br /><br />This book examines the military and political dimensions of America's entry into the North African Campaign.  Its essential thesis is that the American Army, and to a somewhat lesser extent the Navy, were unready for war.  While the US possessed some competent military men, the Army had been drilling with broomsticks prior to the war, and the Navy was not battle-ready.  The consequence was that when the troops landed in North Africa, the logistics were a fiasco, the men were not well-trained, and the leadership, from sergeant on up, had a tremendous amount of learning to do.<br /><br />Author Atkinson pulls no punches.  The British were initially rightly leary of the combat skills of the green American Army, and the first several brushes between the US Army and Rommel resulted in sound American thrashings.  But through all this, the Americans learned rapidly, and by the time the North African campaign had ended, the American Army was a seasoned, if somewhat bloodied, victor.  For North Africa is where the US Army in Europe learned to fight, and this piece makes a persuasive case that North Africa was a vital training ground to season the army that would later competently storm Utah and Omaha Beaches, overcome the setback and in fact fight brilliantly at the Battle of the Bulge, and eventually drive to the heart of Germany.  Never again after North Africa would the American Army play a subordinate role to the British or indeed the army of any other power.  Thus, North Africa can be seen as having set the stage for American military dominance which persists to the present day.<br /><br />This book truly tells the reader everything that anyone but a professional historian could want to know about the North African Campaign.  Initially I thought that the detail was perhaps more than optimal.  After completing the piece, however, I applaud the author for his mastery of detail even as he ties it all together to present the pivotal strategic role that the battles in North Africa had in preparing the allies for victory, and in training the American Army.  I found this book to be an engrossing and satisfying read, with valuable insights about Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and other famous leaders.  Some of these insights will cut against the grain, but I found them interesting.  This one is much recommended.rican Army play a subordinate role to the British or indeed the army of any other power.

Hard work and hard luck is the lot of the Chandler family--cotton farmers in the backwoods of 1950s Arkansas.  In this novel Grisham departs from his usual genre of legal thrillers, and instead tells us the story of tough, hard-working people who scraped a living growing cotton.  Yes, there is a plot (no lawyers to be found) -- in this novel young Luke Chandler witnesses the murder of a bad fellow who has it coming, but in fact the plot surrounding this murder is ancillary to the real story here.  The real tale contained in this novel is that of the backbreaking labor, unrealistic hopes, and hard luck that was (and perhaps still is) the lot of those who tried to scrape a living in the marginal soil of the Deep South.  A family could put every dime into the soil in the form of labor and fertilizer, engage in backbreaking labor to try to harvest the crops, and still end up losing money, either through bad weather spoiling the harvest, good weather spoiling the profits by driving down profits (supply and demand--if everyone has a good crop then the crop values go down while the labor and other costs, if anything, go up.)  Like nothing else I have ever read, this novel explained why so many people in modern America have left farming to seek their fortunes in the city.  Here, Grisham manages to absolutely capture the essence of a way of life that is now quickly dying out in America at least, but which was once the common lot of many, even most, Americans.<br /><br />One fascinating aspect of the novel is its portrayal of the day-laborers, the Mexican laborers on the one hand, and the hill people on the other.  Both are shown with dignity, but without pulling any punches about the tough nature of these people.  They had to be tough to endure working conditions that most modern Americans have never experienced and perhaps do not realize ever existed.<br /><br />This novel is a powerful story of Americana that hits the mark.  Few readers will remain unmoved or unaffected by this story.d by this story.	2005-07-06

John Adams and his pivotal role in bringing about American nationhood are often overlooked in our histories.  This book reveals the human John Adams, as a highly intelligent, dedicated, and imperfect man who accomplished a great deal in his storied lifetime.  This is an eminently readable biography of John Adams that is highly recommended.<br /><br />My favorite element of this story is the author's tellings of Adams' interactions with Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  All three of these indisputably great men were strong personalities, who could be prickly and hard to deal with at times.  Adams perhaps the most of the three.  And yet these men were able to overcome their egos and give their all to the birth of America as a new nation.  This book does a fine job telling much, although by no means all, of this story.  As others have noted, McCullough has a tendency to focus on the human elements of his historical figures, and less upon the ideology that motivates them.  Thus, we know from this book that Adams was dedicated to liberty and independence.  We know somewhat less about why.<br /><br />This is a fine biography that anyone who is interested in American history will appreciate and enjoy.	2005-06-22

In this scenario, the Battle of Gettysburg is a Union debacle (first volume) where Lee takes Longstreet's advice and moves away from the strong Union positions at Gettysburg.  The result is the near-destruction of the Army of the Potomac which sets the stage for a protracted campaign where Lee and Grant confront one another North of the Mason-Dixon line, with Grant given the order to bring about \\"the destruction of the Army of Northern Virginia...\\"<br /><br />Essentially, the authors make just a few changes to history, and extrapolate on what might have been based upon their opinions and analysis of the personalities of the various commanders and politicians.  Mostly their analysis is insightful and interesting.  My main bone to pick with them is their treatment of General Meade, the actual victor of the Battle of Gettysburg.  The authors in volume 1 depict Meade as a vacillating and unimaginative commander, whose shortcomings set the stage for volumes 2 and 3.  The canard of Meade as having simply gotten lucky at Gettysburg is now discounted by most historians (some of this old historical issue has been traced to a disgruntled subordinate of Meade).  Since I have always believed that Meade decisively out-generalled Lee at Gettysburg (the real battle) this unflattering portrait of Meade has irritated me throughout these three volumes.  But that is a matter for a different review.<br /><br />In \\"Never Call Retreat\\" we see that Union victory turned on two main personalities: President Lincoln and General Grant.  Lincoln is facing impeachment and a clamoring in Congress for compromise and defeat.  He knows he must have a decisive victory, and soon, or the Congress may fail to support him, or even impeach him.  Just as in the true history, Lincoln is steadfast, putting preservation of the Union ahead of his political future, in fact ahead of everything.  The authors show this masterfully, although I would have enjoyed even more analysis of Lincoln than the authors give us.<br /><br />The best part of the novel is the characterization of General Grant.  As Lincoln said, \\"...I cannot spare this man.  He fights.\\"  In \\"Never Call Retreat\\" we see General Grant confront General Lee much as he did in the true history of the war.  Grant understood, more than perhaps any general on either side, that Southern guts and elan, powerful as they were, could not in the final analysis stand against the industrial might of the North so long as the Northern armies managed to harness this power and direct it against Lee.  This Grant did do, and this is the story here.<br /><br />One lesson from this novel and series is that although the Civil War was the worst bloodletting in American history, it could have been even worse had Meade not defeated Lee at Gettysburg.  Lincoln was not going to give up, and Lee seemed determined to fight on at any cost, as indeed he did. Since a Union defeat at Gettysburg would not have eliminated the North's superior war potential, a Union defeat there would probably have prolonged the war for a long time, or set the stage for even bloodier battles of decision.  This is basically the story here.<br /><br />Readers will find many bones to pick with the authors' decisions about \\"what might have been\\" in this novel, and that is fine.  This novel and series are designed to entertain, and that they do.  I could not put the book down, and devoured it over a long weekend.  Highly recommended.ct ahead of everything.

US	46160224	R36DXH048JEFQ7	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	America wins freedom and independence!	The theme of this book is of course one of the greatest themes of all time: how America wins her independence by achieving a military victory over the most powerful country and army on earth.  The author shows that the year 1776 was a pivotal year towards this endeavor, as General George Washington and his underequipped, poorly-trained, and outnumbered Army took on the British Army and Navy.<br /><br />Author McCullogh shows us that General Washington understood the difference between strategy and tactics.  A small American victory was devastating to the British, whereas, if the British won a battle the Americans could endure on, since they could hardly be surprised at British successes given the facts that the British Army was superbly equipped, and had recently won victories over most of the major armies in Europe.  We see here that Washington, while not a great military genius, nevertheless had a clear vision of what he and his Army had to do, and he was faithful to that vision under circumnstances that would have ended in discouragement and defeat for a lesser man.  His reputation as the \\"Father of his Country\\" remains intact after McCullough's realistic scrutiny, for we see that the Continental Army probably would not have lasted long without his leadership and determination.<br /><br />Another theme that emerges from the book is the fact that Washington scrupulously respected the supremacy of civilian authority over military.  Although he was often vexed and perplexed by the penury and ignorance of military matters shown by the Continental Congress, he never failed to respect its authority.  Washington's strong ethical and moral code in this regards, during a fragile and formative time in American history, would eventually have beneficial and far-reaching consequences and would stabilize the Republic.  No American Bonapartes.<br /><br />Historians now know that the American Revolution was fought during the last century or so of the Little Ice Age, a period of unusually harsh and cold winters.  In 1776 this harsh weather was much in evidence, and also played a key role in determining the outcome of the Revolution.  The willingness of the Continental Army to suffer through the brutal winter of that year (and later years) surprised the British, and this, along with Washington's leadership and yes, a reasonable ration of luck, helped keep the Americans in the game despite being outclassed in nearly every respect militarily.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized \\"1776\\" for more or less ignoring the aims and ideals of the Colonists and the American Revolution.  This criticism is justified.  The author plainly made a decision to focus more or less exclusively on the military and leadership issues of the time, and not deal with the political ones.  This is a reasonable decision, but in my opinion an unfortunate one.  The author does a fine job documenting that although many Americans deserted during the brutal winter of 1776, enough stayed to save the Cause from defeat.  But why did they do this?  Obviously it was because they believed in the Cause.  The reader cannot derive this from this book, however, because the author has deliberately decided to set aside this component of the story, which component in my opinion is too intertwined with the great story to have been omitted.  Well, perhaps we can look forward to a different book by this fine author on that subject.<br /><br />Overall, a superb look at Washington's leadership and the problems that he and his adversaries faced in 1776.  While not a perfect or complete look at the story, this one is well worth reading and keeping in one's library.riod of unusually harsh and cold winters.

This is the story of modern aviation, and the intrigue within one aircraft manufacturing company. Plot and counterplot abound, to determine who, if anyone, is selling out American technological superiority for twenty pieces of silver, figuratively speaking. Along the way Crichton acquaints the reader with the brilliance, discipline, and high standards that characterize the American aviation industry, and which have made this industry one of the marvels of the world. How Crichton manages to learn so much about each topic of his various novels is the real question; the man is what the British used to call a \\"polymath\\"--a person who can quickly and thoroughly master a plethora of disciplines.<br /><br />This story moves at a breakneck pace and never loses the reader's interest. There are heros and villains within this novel, and sometimes the reader knows who is which and sometimes not. Plenty of suspense here, and this is a fascinating read to which many readers will return multiple times. Highly recommended.  RJB.	2005-05-17

Unfortunately, \\"Son of Rosemary\\" simply does not measure up as a sequel.  The premise is unlikely and the novel simply lacks the creativity, class, and suspense of the original.  Essentially, in the sequel, Rosemary, the mother of \\"Adrian\\" whose father is Satan, wakes from a coma to discover that her son is the wildly popular \\"Andy\\" who is the leader of a messianic movement in the modern-day world.  The reader, of course, knows the truth.  The most interesting part of the novel, to me at least, was the portrayal of what a \\"Christ versus Antichrist\\" scenario might be like in the present day, and this is, indeed, the theme of the novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, since the reader knows the truth, there is none of the suspense which made \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" such a classic (and I am not overusing that word here).  Further, the story's ending is unsatisfactory and unsurprising.  All in all, this is a quick read to which most readers will not return, and it leaves the reader unsatisfied albeit mildly entertained.	2005-05-17

The premise of this novel is interesting enough...eco-terrorists want to cause an epidemic to wipe out most of humanity in order to \\"save\\" the environment.  Of course there are nutcases out there who would probably like to do just that, and as Clancy's novel postulates, it is not out of the question that some of them could conceivably put a plan into work to attempt something of the sort.<br /><br />This novel's strengths are Clancy's familiarity with military technology (as always) and his fairly good grasp of how Washington's power structure functions.  These strengths make this a fairly good read, despite the negatives.  The negatives are that this novel is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the storyline rambles, the terrorists are unconvincing, and the characterizations are not particularly good.<br /><br />All in all this is a good cautionary tale by a good writer who needed a stricter editor.	2005-05-16

In the novel the author causes Alexander to give us his perspective, motivations, thoughts, and doubts about the effort of the Macedonians to conquer all of the known world, including the Greeks' deadly enemy, the Persian Empire.  Alexander's insights are quite interesting, and ring true, as he \\"confides\\" to the reader the difficulties in uniting and leading to victory a disparate army of tough, rude tribesmen some of whom hate one another almost as much as the enemy.<br /><br />I am a (very) amateur historian, and have never understood what happened during the time of Alexander the Great.  This novel does a good job of acquainting the reader with some of the elements that went into Alexander's success.  First and foremost, Alexander held nothing back.  To motivate his army, he gave away essentially all of his vast royal properties and worldly goods to his soldiers, that they might leave to fight without fear of returning to poverty or want.  Even so, he led his men to the point of exhaustion and mutiny.  Again, he held nothing back, and apparently no effort went unexpended.<br /><br />Particularly interesting was the insights regarding the Greek Phalanx, and how Alexander departed from the ritualized convention that had come to dominate Greek tactics.  The Greeks had become rigid and formalized in their tactics, and by departing from this structure, Alexander subdued the other Greek city-states.  A cautionary lesson to all strategists of all times.<br /><br />The author's prose is good, and this book holds the reader's interest throughout, while imparting interesting historical insights and information.  This is a novel that illustrates that actual history is often the source of the most engaging storylines.	2005-05-15

It is set in the same universe as \\"The Mote in God's Eye\\" and takes place contemporaneously with that novel's story.  In this one, the Empire of Man has discovered a colony world of humans that had been bombed back into a technological level about equivalent to Earth in 1900 or so.  The Empire's technology is obviously centuries ahead of the colony's, and the Empire has strict rules about how such backward colonies, which lack space travel, are to be assimilated into the Empire.  The plan involves bringing in favored persons from the Empire and more or less supplanting the local aristocrats with a new nobility.  The locals are expected to submit or else.<br /><br />The ruling folk on the colony get wind of this plan, which the Empire is concealing from them, and hatch a scheme of their own to avoid being subjigated.  More would be telling, but this is actually an engaging and imaginative tale that I have returned to and enjoyed several times.<br /><br />As always, Pournelle does a great job describing ground warfare with ancient weapons (pikes and spears, mostly) and the characterizations in this novel are pretty good.  I enjoyed this one more than \\"The Mote in God's Eye\\" and I highly recommended it to anyone who enjoys a good military-political science fiction novel.	2005-05-13

It is approximately 150 years from now.  Mankind has made first contact with the Vulcans, and later a few other intelligent races, but Earthmen are still the \\"new kids on the block\\" and humans are just beginning to venture out into the stars in a significant way.  Starfleet is very new, and mankind's mentors, the Vulcans, disapprove of these upstart humans getting loose outside of our Solar System.<br /><br />The novel delves into the politics of the construction of the Enterprise and Starfleet, both of which the Vulcans believe are premature, more than the initial television episode did.  I personally find the setting in \\"Enterprise\\" to be more interesting and enjoyable than that in either The Original Series or The Next Generation (both of which I very much enjoyed!) simply because it has a wonderful \\"New Frontier\\" feeling to it.  The new warp technology means that Starfleet has very little knowledge of what lies \\"out there,\\" the other technology is new and sometimes quirky.  The transporter is \\"safe for biotransport\\" but no one relishes the idea of riding the darned thing, which I can understand.  Most races that Enterprise will encounter are new to mankind, and offer new challenges and opportunities.  In this episode, humanity meets up with the Klingons, which is never an easy thing to do!<br /><br />The prose in the novel is good, and this is a very decent read for fans of \\"Star Trek\\" and the \\"Enterprise\\" concept.	2005-05-12

This is one of Poul Anderson's later works, and its basic premise is that there are now, and have been throughout history, a very small number of human beings who for an unknown reason do not grow old -- they are immortals.  The immortals are, however, subject to accidental death or dismemberment, and this happens throughout the centuries.  Further, the offspring of immortals are not themselves immortal, thus the number of these mutants is always very small.<br /><br />The novel traces the lives of a number of immortals from a period of approximately 2000 years ago, to the present day, and then into the far future. They are an eclectic lot. Deathless (later John Wanderer) is an American Indian who sees his culture transformed first by the introduction of the horse &#34;The Way of the Horse&#34; .. and later by conquest by the United States of America.  Svoboda is a Ukrainian woman who lives through the tumultuous history of her nation.  Hanno is originally a Phoenician sailor.  There are several others.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the novel is the historical section, in my opinion, where the immortals struggle through some key historical events.  Anderson has a very strong knowledge and grasp of history, and this shines through as the immortals live through various periods of history.  I was less impressed with the section dealing with the present day, although it was serviceable.<br /><br />The section of the novel dealing with the future, where the immortals need no longer conceal their unique nature (mankind learns how to prolong life indefinitely by artificial means) is unfortunately based upon what appears to be Anderson's real belief about man's future.  Here, Anderson predicts that most aspects of the world will be run and controlled by sentient artificial intelligences, i.e. supercomputers.  This is the future he postulates in other novels, e.g. The Stars are Also Fire and others.  In this vision, ordinary organic intelligence, i.e. you and I, simply cannot keep up with or compete with the entities of artificial intelligence which come to control civilization.  I personally find this vision to be both unconvincing and uninspiring, but who can say?  Possibly Anderson will turn out to have been right.  But on balance Anderson's prediction as to mankind's future is dark and pessimistic.  I much prefer the dazzling future vision of Anderson's Polesotechnic League stories.<br /><br />While this is not Anderson's best work, it is a very interesting and enjoyable read featuring some very creative speculation about the nature of human beings and our possible future.mpete with the entities of artificial intelligence which come to control civilization.

We all know the story: US GIs and British Tommy POWs at Stalag Luft 3 staged, during World War II, probably the greatest escape operation of all time.  This is the true story of what went on, and it is a great story.<br /><br />The reader will appreciate the courage and perhaps even more, the ingenuity of the soldiers who managed to turn the POW camp's \\"operational purpose\\" to be to conduct escape attempts.  The basic notion was that by focusing on escape, the captive Allied soldiers could contribute materially to the war effort by tying down a disproportionate amount of German military and police forces.  This they did do.<br /><br />The \\"Great Escape\\" largely ended in tragedy, but this in no way detracts from the heroism of the men who conducted it.  This is a fascinating and engaging read to which the discerning reader will return many times.	2005-04-15

Allied POWs in Germany	This is a fascinating book about life in a certain POW camp in Germany during World War II.  Its authenticity is unquestioned, as it is based upon a diary of events that was written down at the time, rather than later, after memories faded.  The book is as detailed a look at life behind barbed wire as one could want.  This is a very comprehensive book.<br /><br />Stalag Luft 3, the camp, is where the actual \\"Great Escape\\" occurred, but that is only a small part of this book, which concentrates on detailing the POW experience from capture and interrogation to the war's end.<br /><br />The interesting thing that I derived from the book was that although the Germans were not completely scrupulous about living up to their obligations under the Geneva convention, they at least paid attention to these rules, and most allied POWs who made it alive to a camp did make it home alive after the war.  That is more than can be said, by a wide margin, for those American and Allied soldiers who were POWs of the Japanese.  Part of this, the book speculates, is because the Luftwaffe held these  POWs (this was a camp for airmen POWs) and it knew that England was holding large numbers of shot-down Luftwaffe pilots.  Both sides wanted their men to be treated well.  It is probably accurate to say that most of the outrages that the Germans committed against allied soldiers occurred before the captured soldiers reached the German camp system.  The massacre of American GIs at Malmady comes to mind.  Also, when escaped POWs fell into the hands of the Gestapo, this was never good.<br /><br />Despite this, however, the book makes clear the shortcomings of the German treatment of the men.  The food ration amounted to slow-motion starvation, unless the men supplemented their rations  in various ways including the famous \\"Red Cross parcels.\\"  Sanitation was rudimentary until the POWs themselves took a hand in designing a latrine system.  On the other hand, the book also makes clear that the German staff of the camp got pretty lean rations too--the fact appears to be that Germany was having a hard time as the war progressed feeding anyone, let alone POWs.<br /><br />The most fascinating part of the story, to me at least, was the interaction between the POWs and the German camp staff.  There were collaborators on both sides, and many of the German staff evidently felt that Germany was likely to lose the war, and this appears to have encouraged some collaboration.  Pretty interesting.<br /><br />Another fascinating facet of the book is how the POWs at Stalag Luft III organized what amounted to a college, which actually conferred credit hours which, after the war, were accepted by many British and American universities as good credit towards a degree.  Courage and hope amidst adversity!  Good for them!<br /><br />The degree of detail in this book is startling, and may be more than some readers want to know about camp life, but I found that this detail gave a gritty and realistic comprehenstion to the reader about what camp life was like.<br /><br />An excellent piece of history that retains its relevance to the present day.German staff of the camp got pretty lean rations too--the fact appears to be that Germany was having a hard time as the war progressed feeding anyone, let alone POWs. <br /> <br />The most fascinating part of the story, to me at least, was the interaction between the POWs and the German camp staff.

US	46160224	RKF1BF08WF44Q	0812540395	545337496	For Love and Glory	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	A good read.  Thoughtful galactic adventure.	Poul Anderson is one of my favorite science fiction authors, although I tend to like his earlier works better than his later ones.  This novel is one of his later works, but it avoids the bloat that has characterized several of his recent novels, which is a relief.<br /><br />This is essentially the story of an aristocratic woman of the future, on a distant planet settled largely (apparently) by Icelanders.  There are roughly half-a-dozen alien races whose technology is roughly on a par with Humankind.  This story to a large extent deals with the interactions of these aliens with humans, and Anderson's speculations about what intelligent alien beings might be like are quite interesting.<br /><br />The basic plot is straightforward.  Other than the several alien civilizations on a rough par with humanity, there was an earlier race known as the Forerunners, which reached a higher-than-human level of technology many thousands of years ago.  Forerunner artifacts still exist, and of course to find and control such artifacts could give one or the other alien races a huge military-industrial advantage over the others.  Therein lies the struggle.<br /><br />As Anderson fans know, most of his more recent science fiction novels have assumed that it is inevitable that Earth would eventually become dominated by computerized artificial intelligences, as Man's computers surpass his capabilities and gradually assume most or all vital functions.  This novel is no exception, and this premise is there, but thankfully, the novel mostly avoids this topic (which Anderson has thoroughly explored elsewhere) and the real subject of this novel is the interactions of organic human and alien civilizations.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good read, and much better than much of the recent science fiction that has been published lately.  The storyline is reasonably lucid, the characters, while not particularly memorable, are at least somewhat interesting (especially the aliens), and the novel moves along at a smart pace without dragging.  Not Anderson's best, but worth taking a look at.out dragging.  Not Anderson's best, but worth taking a look at.	2005-04-07

Sir Dominic Flandry of the Terran Empire is the James Bond of the 31st Century.  Set in a time when humankind has established an interstellar empire consisting of 4 million stars, Flandry finds himself charged with the role of preserving a decadent, tired empire.  But these stories are for the most part great fun.  Flandry is a character, and as always Poul Anderson the author has something to say and a fair amount of fun saying it.  Flandry notes that real decadence is fun, not \\"lolling around on cushions eating drugged custard!\\"  In any case, he manages to get plenty of adventure, which he defines as \\"someone else, somewhere else, having a devil of a hard time!\\"<br /><br />Although this particular set of \\"Flandry\\" stories are not my favorite (\\"Agent of the Terran Empire\\" is far and away the best of the \\"Flandry\\" series) this collection is perfect for an afternoon at the beach with beer and chips, which is exactly how and where I enjoyed it.

A fascinating read!	The avowed purpose of this book was to tell the history of the United States, from the time of Columbus to the modern age, without giving into a \\"Politically Correct\\" agenda and without what has become almost obligatory America-bashing in some quarters.  The book succeeds thoroughly and brilliantly.  This piece is a find, and one may hope for the day that this one becomes a standard text in American schools.<br /><br />The basic premise of the authors is that America has always been special among nations despite its acknowledged imperfections. The special nature of the American nation derives from the author's belief that the broad goal of the government (with many diversions, which the authors explore at length) has been to promote and safeguard its citizens' liberty and freedom of action, thereby allowing them to maximize their potential in all spheres of life, i.e. economic, scholarship, the arts, etc.  It is no accident, say the authors, has America consistently produced most major scientific advances and utterly dominated the ranks of Nobel Prize winners.<br /><br />And yet the authors do not ignore the many problems that America has had to (often imperfectly) deal with throughout its history.  The book extensively reviews the issues of slavery and the civil rights movement a century later.  The Federal Government comes in for harsh criticism during both eras.  In particular the authors, who are no right-wing zealots, note that the FBI had plenty of time and resources to investigate Martin Luther King, while at least for a time, the extremist anti-civil rights militants who were bombing black churches and conducting lynchings went uninvestigated.  King is portrayed, accurately, as one of the great leaders of the 20th Century who endured great hardships and took great risks to eliminate injustices to which most Americans had becomed accustomed to turning a blind eye.<br /><br />In no sense is the American governmental system presented in this piece as a perfect one.  For example, the conduct of the Federal Government both during Reconstruction, and later the New Deal, come in for harsh criticism.  The authors note that one of the traits of the American government is that eventually it usually yields to public opinion, wisely or not.  They view this fact as the underlying cause of the New Deal, which by modern economic standards can be seen as a hodgepodge of contradictory and probably not-helpful big government programs of dubious value.  For decades such programs were viewed by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional, but during the depression suddenly the Court (after badgering by FDR) suddenly found these popular programs to be just fine constitutionally.  Richard Nixon's wage and price controls they view in the same light--the government sucumbing to public opinion and the Constitution bending, but not breaking, to accommodate the direction in which the citizenry wishes to be led.  Johnson's Great Society is shown, with statistical evidence that it is hard to find fault with, to have had dreadful effects upon the poor, particular urban poor, and to have ultimately constituted a catastrophic governmental blunder.<br /><br />With all these imperfections, this piece depicts the great sweep of the American nation in its true light, and acknowledges the special role that America has played in the world.  The Mexican War is depicted with fascinating insight--the authors point out a little-known fact (in these days of \\"PC\\") that Mexico was spoiling for a war with the United States which it fully expected to win.  European observers, contemptuous of American military prowess (perhaps remembering the War of 1812 and the burning of the White House) were predicting that the Mexican Army would eventually occupy Washington DC.  But America's Army, officered by West Point graduates such as Robert E. Lee and Ulysses Grant, and others who would become legends in their own lifetimes, showed the world perhaps for the first time that the United States was a military power to be reckoned with.  After the Civil War, a generation later, this fact would never be doubted again.  And yet, with the exception of the Mexican War, the authors point out that every war after that in which America fought it did so not to gain territory or wealth, and when it did occupy foreign territory it divested itself of such lands as quickly as it politically could do so.  And such occupation by America of her former enemies almost invariably has led to a mushrooming of prosperity within such nations.  These facts, practiced by America almost unique among nations are another aspect, argue the authors, of the special nature of the United States among nations.<br /><br />People favoring a Left-oriented view of America will perhaps not find this book to their liking, but most I think will agree that this is a balanced look at America that acknowledges her flaws while also not losing sight of American exceptionalism.  Which exceptionalism, the authors argue, derives from the fact that protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual, throughout the nation's history, has been the (largely) consistent goal of the American culture and system of government.<br /><br />Overall, this is a satisfying and absorbing read, and this is a book to which most readers will return many times.that the United States was a military power to be reckoned with.

This is the Horatio Hornblower of science fiction!  Great space opera, perfect for a beer and chips afternoon at the beach or whatnot.<br /><br />Here, the Polesotechnic League has fallen (see Anderson's \\"Trader to the Stars,\\" \\"Mirkheim,\\" \\"Satan's World,\\" \\"The Trouble Twisters,\\" and several others) to be replaced by a decadent and corrupt Terran Empire, which rules millions of worlds in the Galaxy.  It is opposed by all manner of villains, including the warlike Merseans.  Everyone can see that the Terran Empire, like the Roman Empire before it, will oneday fall, and that this will be a bloody business costing billions of lives.  This is the time in which Dominic Flandry, of the Imperial Terran Intelligence Service, finds himself.  His purpose is to basically try to hold the Empire together, at least for his time.

That is about all one can say about this one. Here, the plot is not very interesting, the character is not very sympathetic, and Grisham departs from his usual legal thriller genre and makes a foray into writing a spy thriller. The effort is not successful. Grisham plainly is simply not very knowledgeable about espionage, and this fact subtly permeates the novel. This novel just does not have the feel of authenticity that is characteristic of a good spy novel. Grisham admits as much in the novel's \\"afterwards\\" and he is quite right. And in my opinion this was a significant detriment.<br /><br />The storyline to this one is murky and not particularly interesting. The core of the novel is a long draggy segment in which the protagonist is in Italy trying to assimilate the language and culture. Not very interesting and this travelog fails to disguise the fact that this novel does not have much of a plot or much of a story.<br /><br />Grisham is at his best when he sets out to write a story about the legal profession, although his recent efforts in that direction have been disappointing too. This one gets two stars due to its modest readability, but is otherwise a plain disappointment. RJB.	2005-01-23

This is a fabulous novel.  The premise is fascinating.  Earth moves into a portion of the galaxy which is absent a form of energy field which our world had previously been surrounded by for perhaps a billion years.  The effect of the absence of this \\"inhibitor field\\" is that all animal life on Earth experiences a huge increase in nervous system efficiency, mainly resulting in a quantum leap in intelligence.  The rest would be telling, but this is a very well-written and fascinating story even if some of the political backdrop is now anachronistic.  What would happen if human intelligence quadrupled or more, such that human morons became geniuses, and average humans became something we can perhaps not even imagine?  That is the premise of this throught-provoking story.<br /><br />Anderson at his best is hard to beat, and this is among his best works.  Every lover of Science Fiction should read and own this novel, as should anyone who loves a good yarn that stretches the reader's imagination.	2005-01-13

This old \\"classic\\" is a great tour-de-farce that Anderson masterfully keeps just on the edge of plausibility.  The premise is simple.

The premise, however, is straightforward: the novel takes place in an alternate universe much like our own except for one thing: here, magic exists as a practical means of doing things, and various human beings are adepts at various types of magic.  The protagonist is a true werewolf, his co-protagonist girlfriend/wife is a witch.<br /><br />There is a plot and a conflict, and this one is great fun and quite interesting.  The prose is also superb, which makes this fantasy novel an enjoyable page-turner, very unlike most fantasy novels, at least in my opinion.  Here Anderson proves that he was very capable of writing either \\"hard\\" SF (for which he is probably best known) or Grade-A fantasy.  Not many authors can do that, and perhaps none as well as Anderson.  This one is a true pleasure to read and to recommend.	2005-01-13

The premise of Resurrection Day is that the Cuban Missile Crisis got out of hand, and escalated into a full nuclear exchange following a US invasion of Cuba.  The aftermath is that the Soviet Union has been completely destroyed, and the United States is crippled, economically depressed, and under what amounts to a military dictatorship.  The US is the junior partner of Great Britain, which is untouched by the war, and which has supplanted the US as the preeminent world power.  The British mission to the US wields great power within the country.  Here, by the way, the author uses the same concept of a US as a political satellite of Britain that Streiber used in \\"Warday\\" (which is another, earlier novel about the aftermath of a limited nuclear exchange).<br /><br />The story moves along reasonably well, although I would not say that the ending is particularly startling.  The novel's strong suit is the detail and realism of the author's portrayal of America under military control.  One gets the impression from reading the novel that such a thing could happen, and that it would of course be a disaster for the country.<br /><br />Like \\"Warday\\" the novel's weak suit is its premise that an America that is down for the count would not get back on its feet in the manner shown by the Germans and Japanese following the second world war.  The novel gives no real explanation for why it assumes that America would remain poor and impoverished from devastation that, while bad, is less complete than what either Germany or Japan experienced from WW2.<br /><br />Overall a decent read.  It accomplishes its goal of making the reader appreciate the fact that the Cuban Missile Crisis did not escalate.	2005-01-10

This novel is an excellent read, if perhaps not Crichton's best work (in my opinion Jurassic Park was better).  But this is a powerful, controversial, and thought-provoking novel.  The basic premise is simple enough--that the science that supports the present \\"Global Warming\\" hypothesis is suspect and at best incomplete.  Or at worst, based on deliberately skewed and selective experimental data.<br /><br />The novel's plot is simple enough.  Enviro-terrorists are seeking to artificially create several catastrophes in order to promote the public's belief in the Global Warming Hypothesis and to force the US and other governments to act.  More would be telling (no spoilers here) but Crichton's basic theme is that the Global Warming Hypothesis may very well be bad science.  A correllary theme is that the Global Warming-Environmentalist movement is a business like any other, with a stake in causing the public to fear the future climatological destiny of Planet Earth.<br /><br />This basic theme will certainly be poorly received by those who are convinced of the existence of Global Warming.  (And they may be right; who can say?) Those willing to read Crichton's novel and its arguments with an open mind may very well come away convinced in another direction.  As always, Crichton appears to have mastered the science that underlies the novel, and surely all of us can acknowledge that this is a brilliant man with an amazing background and an awesome array of talents.  One dismisses Crichton at his or her peril.<br /><br />This was a satisfying read, although at times I found the plot a bit hard to follow.  As always, Crichton gets you where he wants to take you, and for the most part the storyline moves along smartly with few draggy periods.  The discussion of the science/arguments involving the Global Warming Hypothesis I found terrifically interesting.  Crichton provides some fascinating data and even more fascinating political analysis.  Whether you accept it or not.<br /><br />I'm giving this one four stars rather than five only because in my subjective opinion this is not Crichton's best novel.  But it is a darned good one.

On the one hand, this novel is not great literature on the level of say, \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert.  On the other hand, \\"Old Man's War\\" is a terrific read, very imaginative, and not terribly implausible.<br /><br />No spoilers here, so my discussion of the story will be limited.  The essential premise and storyline is that in the near future, Earth/humankind have discovered the \\"skip drive\\" which is a method of interstellar space travel.  Mankind quickly learns that valuable planets are a scarce commodity and there are several intelligent races in our neck of the Galaxy that as a matter of routine try to use military force to take planets away from other races.  Including, of course, human colonial planets.  Accordingly, to protect Earth and also to protect colony worlds, the \\"Colonial Defense Force\\" enlists elderly human beings on Earth as soldiers to protect the colony worlds.  The protagonist in the novel is such a one.<br /><br />The novel includes pretty strong character development.  It manages to make some of the characters both lifelike and alien.  This is no small feat and a task that most science fiction authors struggle with.  Here, the author succeeds.<br /><br />The author's speculations about what interaction between mankind and aliens will be like are startling.  The reader can decide for him or her self whether they are plausible.  I was not able to say that they were implausible, at any rate.<br /><br />The novel contains dazzling speculation about the future destiny of humanity in space and technology in general.  This, combined with a fast-moving storyline and solid plot, earns this one five stars in my opinion.  Quite frankly, this is far and away the best science fiction novel that I have read since \\"Dune\\" and \\"The Forever War\\" and it gives my old favorite \\"The Forever War\\" a run for its money in terms of which is my favorite military science fiction novel of all time.

US	46160224	R2YQX1HHH278UI	044024157X	817294609	The Last Juror	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Plodding.  An OK read, but that is all.	I would probably rate \\"The Last Juror\\" as 2.5 stars, but since Amazon won't let me do that, and since I am absolutely certain that John Grisham could have done much better, I'm going to round down rather than round up.  This is a plodding novel with an obvious plot and a not-very-satisfying ending (no spoilers here).  It is a decent read for a boring rainy afternoon, or a warm afternoon at the beach, but that is about it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the story of a very bad family in Mississippi who are involved in moonshining, drugs, etc.  One of the family scions commits a dreadful rape-murder, and is sentenced to life imprisonment.  He vows to seek revenge on the jurors, and sure enough, when he is released the jurors start getting shot or killed.  More would be telling, except that there  is not much more to tell.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of the owner of the town newspaper owner/editor.  Grisham almost manages to make this chap an interesting character (Grisham is not known for the three-dimensionality of his characters) but he fails.  Mostly the  protagonist-editor relates a series of endless meals with the family of one of the jurors.  He manages to make this boring too.  The novel goes off on all kinds of tangents about news reporting of the civil rights movement in the 1960s South, and later the struggle between megastores (i.e. a thinly disguised clone of Wal-Mart) and mom-and-pop storefront stores.  This is mildly interesting, but has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, and nothing to do with the characters either.  Basically it simply represents Grisham on various soapboxes.  Maybe he gets paid by the word; that is all I can think of.<br /><br />By the way, Grisham can usually be depended upon to at least write an interesting narrative of a trial.  Not here.  Here the trial is one dimensional and caricaturistic--never was there a more reprehensible villain or less suspense as regards the outcome.  He could have summarized the trial on a page or two and entertained the reader no less.<br /><br />I gave it 2.5 stars because Grisham's prose is not bad, and the novel did contain some interesting insights about life and news in a small Southern town which was interesting to a Southern California boy like myself.  But this novel seems to have been written to make Grisham's Mercedes payment or something.  It had little to say, and managed to take 500 pages to say it.

This historical novel tells the famous story of how three hundred Spartan soldiers and a few allies and auxiliaries held a crucial mountain pass against a huge Persian army bent on conquering Greece.  The novel puts this remarkable historic event from the ancient world into an interesting perspective for the 21st century reader.<br /><br />The main thing that I got out of the novel is the reason for the extreme military nature of Sparta, and indeed many/most of the ancient Greek city states.  Basically, every Greek city and citizen lived in constant danger of being subdued militarily by any of many military rivals.  The consequences of such vanquishment were severe--the men killed, the women ravished, the children enslaved.  Only constant military vigilance could prevent this, and I suppose Sparta represented this determination not to be defeated at its extreme.  As the novel relates in gruesome detail, each Spartan boy underwent military training the harshness of which is difficult to overstate.  US Marine boot camp is a holiday excursion in comparison.  The entire society and its mores of duty, honor, and service represented a determination to preserve the independence and freedom of the Spartan city-state.<br /><br />The fact that Greece bordered Asia, where the Persian empire repeatedly sought to overrun Greece added to the need for Sparta and other Greek states to remain militarized.  The novel relates indirectly the truism of military technology since ancient times, which is that no Western army has ever been defeated other than by another Western-style army.  The Persian King in this novel learns that although he has a huge army, very few of his soldiers are in the same class of skill and technology as the Greeks he seeks to conquer.<br /><br />The novel cannot be called a quick and easy read, but once the reader gets into the story, it becomes hard to put down.  The strong point of the novel and story in my opinion are the author's insights into the nature and motivations of the ancient world and the reason for Sparta's militarism.  A novel that can convey all that is well worth reading.  Recommended.nature and motivations of the ancient world and the reason for Sparta's militarism.

US	46160224	RHTYC0QBAFLI5	0446576638	294324369	Night Fall	Books	4	44	49	N	Y	Corey is back, and in top form!  A fine detective novel.	Night Fall is the latest political/detective thriller by my favorite author, Nelson DeMille.  This novel features Detective John Corey, formerly of the NYPD, again dealing with terrorists and a mystery to solve.  I am not going to get into the story for fear of dropping a \\"spoiler.\\"  Suffice to say, the story deals with the crash of Flight 800 and what might have caused it.<br /><br />The John Corey character was the protagonist in \\"Plum Island\\" which I thought was one of the best detective novels I ever read.  He continued in \\"The Lion's Game\\" which was also excellent.  I thought that \\"Night Fall\\" moved at a snappier pace than \\"The Lion's Game\\" and frankly it really kept me turning the pages.  The only reason that I deprived \\"Night Fall\\" of that fifth star is that I thought that \\"Plum Island\\" was even better.  But this is an excellent, superb novel, and comes highly recommended.<br /><br />DeMille, like a number of contemporary authors (Tom Clancy comes to mind) sometimes has a tendency to write a longer novel than necessary to tell a story.  I personally thought that his novels \\"Up Country\\" and \\"The Lion's Game\\" were examples of this.  Now, for DeMille lovers (like me) this is no problem because we cannot get enough of DeMille's always-excellent writing, but it may put off newcomers.  Both \\"Plum Island\\" and now \\"Night Fall\\" avoid this issue.  These are well-written, fast-paced stories with believable characters, a solid plot, and a storyline that moves quickly and effectively.  \\"Night Fall\\" will not disappoint, and it is good to see DeMille return to a sparer, leaner form of writing.  This is not to say that the novel lacks depth.  Not at all.  One of DeMille's strengths is that he makes his characters become real, and this is certainly the case in \\"Night Fall.\\"  And \\"Night Fall\\" also succeeds because the clues are there for the reader to pick up, and the reader can appreciate the ingenuity with which the protagonist, John Corey, deals with the mystery at hand--what brought down Flight 800.  And other issues along with it.<br /><br />This is a fine DeMille novel that the discerning reader will read, savor, and re-read.nd--what brought down Flight 800.

The time: the year 10,191.  The place: the planet Arrakis.  This is the story of humankind in an inconceivably distant future and a divergent society that is utterly unlike our own.  Nevertheless, the triumph of this novel is that Frank Herbert makes this strange setting utterly real to the reader and every bit as internally consistent as today's world, despite its frank alieness from \\"modern day\\" 21st century society.<br /><br />Essentially, many millinieum from now, mankind has spread throughout the Galaxy by way of a hazardous faster-than-light means of space travel.  The danger of space travel is mitigated by a single resource: the spice melange, which is available only on one planet in the galaxy: Dune, the planet Arrakis. Melange makes it possible for spaceship Navigators to foresee, and therefore avoid, the many hazards of space and space travel. This novel is the story of a struggle to control Arrakis and thereby control the Galaxy by controlling the one essential resource that makes all interstellar commerce possible.<br /><br />Herbert's characterizations are incomparably brilliant.  The discerning reader will never forget Leto Atreides, the Lady Jessica, Paul Muad 'dib Atreides, the Naib Stilgar, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and a host of other characters that Herbert conjures up seemingly effortlessly.  This is a great story of human struggle on a titanic scale.<br /><br />Although this novel is somewhat hard going for the first time reader, the rewards of seeing it through are great, for this is a wonderful story of imagination, intrigue, struggle, and triumph.  This review cannot begin to do justice to a novel that is quite simply a masterpiece of imagination.	2004-09-23

Men against the Sea!	\\"Blind Man's Bluff\\" is a book that in any other country but the USA would have put its author and contributors in jail.  For this is the story of many classified missions undertaken during the bad old days of the Cold War by American submarines against the Soviet Union.  These missions were utterly classified, and startlingly successful much of the time.<br /><br />Unknown to almost all American citizens, for several decades the US Navy's submarine force engaged in an aggressive intelligence campaign against the Soviet Union--in fact it is said that many US subs spent more time in Soviet coastal waters than did most Soviet vessels.  According to this book, the Glomar Explorer episode, far from being an intelligence coup, was a poorly thought-out venture into the US Navy's turf by the CIA.  On the other hand, various other heretofore unknown undersea intelligence operations were hugely successful, perhaps adding to US security in ways that most of us will never understand well enough to appreciate.<br /><br />Regardless of one's personal attitude about the Cold War, this book makes plain the amazing level of both competence and courage that characterized US Navy submarine crews.  It may have been peacetime to most of us, but these sailors went in harm's way often, putting their lives on the line by venturing into Soviet waters where their presence, if detected, would lead to a very likely lethal response.<br /><br />The book gives some interesting perspectives on the Cold War.  Soviet submarines never felt secure, and the Soviet Navy had an accurate perception that any time its submarines put to sea they were being aggressively hunted by a relentless, technically advanced enemy.  On the other hand, much of this American technological and industrial prowess was at least in part neutralized by the second oldest profession in the world--human spies, i.e. the Walker spy ring and perhaps others.  This book explains how an American intelligence operation that undoubtedly cost billions of dollars was eventually thwarted by a few traitors who were paid, at most, tens of thousands of dollars in bribes by the KGB.<br /><br />This book is more engaging than any espionage novel and is a must-read for those interested in either espionage or stories of men at sea.edly cost billions of dollars was eventually thwarted by a few traitors who were paid, at most, tens of thousands of dollars in bribes by the KGB. <br /> <br />This book is more engaging than any espionage novel and is a must-read for those interested in either espionage or stories of men at sea.	2004-09-21

We all know what this book is about, so there is no need to recap it here.  My impressions were these:<br /><br />1.  It seems clear that the majority of those who served with John Kerry were not particularly impressed with him during the 4 months he served in Vietnam.  Some of them plainly despise him to this day, including the authors of and contributors to this book.<br /><br />2.  Some of the dislike that Kerry's fellow servicemen have for him derives from the way he apparently put himself in for his various medals.  This was counter to the \\"aw shucks\\" attitude of many, who would not accept a Purple Heart, for example, even if offered unless the wound was quite grave.  It now seems corroborated and certain that Kerry's Purple Hearts (particularly the first one) probably are questionable.  That Kerry was unusually anxious to establish \\"war hero\\" credentials seems evident by the bizarre fact that he took 8mm home movies of himself while in Vietnam.  Further, by \\"bugging out\\" for the States based on an obscure and rarely-invoked technicality (3 Purple Heart awards = trip home), Kerry further alienated his peers (although some accounts say that they encouraged him to leave).<br /><br />3.  More of the dislike that Kerry inspires in his military peers plainly derives from Kerry's antiwar activities once he returned home.  By claiming that his fellow veterans were war criminals, Kerry plainly committed an unforgivable sin in the eyes of his former comrades.  Nor has this claim by Kerry stood the test of time.  Further, his \\"I was in Cambodia\\" claims, extensively documented here, are now known to be flatly untrue, and Kerry must have always known they were untrue.  The authors and contributors of this book plainly know this.<br /><br />For readers interested in knowing the non-Kerry side of the above three points, this is essential reading.  Pro-Kerry persons will almost certainly dismiss this book because it is unabashedly hostile to Kerry--the authors make no bones about that.  Unfortunately for Kerry, this is a highly readable book that holds the reader's interest, and is in fact an interesting recap of parts of the late antiwar movement including Vietnam Veterans Against the War.  The book documents the fact that many of the \\"veterans\\" of VVAW had never been to Vietnam, and many were not veterans at all.<br /><br />This is an important book because it plainly gives one point of view about a man who seeks America's highest and most powerful office.  Each reader must judge for him or her self whether they accept the viewpoint that this book presents.no bones about that.

This is a surprisingly easy read about a complicated subject--really the effect of heavier-than-air aircraft upon military history, and to a lesser extent, upon industrial development.  Author Boyne is obviously possessed of a vast knowledge about his subject.  Sometimes this can be the downfall of a book of this type, where a torrent of facts can overwhelm the overall theme of a work.  Not here.  Boyne tells the story of the rise and development of air power in a clear, concise, and yet nevertheless surprisingly detailed way.  I was frankly expecting something of a hard slog to get through a serious work such as this.  I was pleasently surprised, because this is a readable work that keeps the reader interested and the pages turning.  Mr. Boyne does not merely relate facts--he tells a story, punctuated with interesting insights, opinions, and conclusions.  The reader can decide whether he or she agrees with Mr. Boyne's various conclusions.  Personally, I was usually persuaded, if not necessarily always.<br /><br />Since this is an overall look at the rise of air power, it contained less details on some subjects than I would have liked to see.  For example, the book covers the battle between the US 8th Air Force (and its British counterparts) and the German Luftwaffe with just enough detail to leave me wanting more, this being a subject of intense interest to me.  Another fascinating observation by Mr. Boyne is his conclusion that the development of air power, and its demand for high-quality industrial specifications, had far-reaching effects upon industrial development.  This is undoubtedly true, although I personally had never really thought about it before.  More facts illustrating this plausible conclusion would have been welcome.  On the other hand, too much more detail on these and many other subjects would of course have increased the scope of this book beyond the appreciation of most readers.  This is the inherent shortcoming of a work of this type, and Boyne strikes a reasonable balance.<br /><br />Overall, the reader is unlikely to find a better written or researched book about this broad subject.oyne strikes a reasonable balance. <br /> <br />Overall, the reader is unlikely to find a better written or researched book about this broad subject.	2004-08-25

This book essentially consists of educated speculation about what might have happened had Nazi Germany successfully invaded and occupied Great Britain. The first portion of the book consists of an imaginary scenario in which the German &quot;Field Greys&quot; successfully stage landings in Kent and other locations on the British Isles. The author does a creditable job of arguing that such an event was at least possible, if not something the Germans could have accomplished easily. As is known by all, such success was dependent upon defeat of the RAF by the Luftwaffe, and the author certainly explains this.<br /><br /> The book then shifts to what the occupation would have been like, and mainly examines life in the occupied Channel Islands (small British island possessions which the Germans did successfully occupy) and prognosticates as to how the Germans would have conducted an occupation of the entire British Isles. Some intriguing questions emerge. Would the Nazi regime truly have carried out its written plans to evacuate the entire young male population of Britain to camps on the Continent? This would have involved at least 12 million young men, and would have constituted a stupendous act of genocide. Although the Nazi regime certainly showed itself capable of such acts of inhumanity, the author argues that sheer matters of practicality probably would have caused a softening in such draconian plans. Other similar interesting details abound in what is probably the most detailed look ever at a scenario that the world averted by all too narrow a margin.<br /><br /> This is a readable book, and in my opinion a very honest and authentic one. If this subject is of interest to you, don't pass it up.	2004-07-27

I found &quot;Justice for None&quot; to be a very enjoyable read.  It crackles with realism--the reader is transported back to the bad old days of the late 1920s, when prosperity was for the few, and hard work and hard luck was the lot of most Americans.<br />Against the backdrop of the looming and imminent Great Depression this story takes place.  The protagonist is a World War One hero, who is also a hard-luck case.  Rather than being rewarded and recognized for his heroism in Europe, he is scarred by his wartime suffering, and his marriage does not survive the strain.  When someone murders his estranged wife, he is the suspect, and then a fugitive.<br />The eventual courtroom scenario, as it plays out in the novel, is the story's climax and also involves the best writing in the novel.  Further, it seemed to me (I am a trial attorney) that the authors did an exceptionally good job of showing the reason for some of our procedural safeguards in court that protect defendants.  The absence of these safeguards in this 1929 trial work to the very great, and unfair, disadvantage of the protagonist.  I thought that the authors did an exceptional job of bringing this out, and the trial has a gritty feel of realism, right down to the incident (no real spoiler here) in which the defense attorney realizes that his client has not been  entirely truthful or candid with him.  There, as in real life, this is a potentially fatal mistake.<br />The ending surprised me a bit, and the authors do a good job of tying up the loose ends in the story, making for a startling conclusion to a satisfying read.	2004-07-13

In fact, in my opinion, it stank.  The plot is formulaic, and Hailey, as he has tended to do over the past 20 years, mistakes overpessimism for profundity.  But I digress.<br />In &quot;The Evening News&quot; we are supposed to believe that the electronic news media functions as a form of superagency that can and does outperform the FBI and CIA while simultaneously acting at a level above that of the government.  What nonsense.  The whole plot is permeated with this tripe.<br />I will give Hailey credit for keeping the book moving.

Naturally I view the man and his book from that perspective.  However, let me say that I acknowledge that Clinton was in many ways an extraordinarily competent politician who was a formidable political foe of my side.  He deserves the respect one gives to a competent adversary.  Look, let us face it: Clinton was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to finish two full terms in office.  Not an insignificant achievement.<br />I agonized between a two star and a three star rating, because I wanted to be fair but not to a fault.  I finally went with two stars because to be honest, this is a long hard slog and does not remotely constitute \\"a good read.\\"  It should have been and could have if Mr. Clinton had had a good editor.  But no.<br />That being said, I think that Mr. Clinton did himself a disservice in this book.  Maybe because he wrote it too soon, without the benefit of some historical perspective, which might have developed given a bit more time.  As someone else observed, can you imagine the memoirs of great presidents such as Jackson, Reagan, or Roosevelt having a chapter dealing with a sordid event involving a young woman intern?  The question is its own answer.<br />Clinton should have focused on what he wanted to achieve, and why this led him to a career in politics.  Instead, we are presented with largely irrelevant and not very interesting background on his life, most of which information he incoherently presents without any real context.  The book rambles and dwells in a literal desert of irrelevant facts, anecdotes, people, and places.  When he does talk about his administration and its goals, (which I might have hoped would be the central theme of his book, but almost is not) I found it coming across as self-serving, largely as a quest for a legacy.  I admit that my view on this might be influenced by my own hostility towards the man and his agenda.  However, contrast this book with any analysis of say, Franklin D. Roosevelt (whom conservatives such as myself admire even as we dislike his policies) and you have to conclude that this book (and this man) come up short.  By the way, I don't hold it against Mr. Clinton that he chose to mostly gloss over the other \\"bimbo eruptions\\" (that is what his own people called it) that characterized his administration and his earlier political career.  I do mind that he seems to be trying to say that he was right on the job as regards terrorism when we all know that he viewed the terrorist problem as a distraction from his real goals of universal health care and the rest of the progressive-liberal agenda (which the Republican Congress with which he had to contend largely thwarted).<br />Bottom line: if you are really interested in Bill Clinton, read this book, but don't expect this book to establish any kind of legacy.  If you are not particularly interested in Clinton, steer clear entirely.r, contrast this book with any analysis of say, Franklin D.

A must for Civil War buffs.	&quot;Grant Comes East&quot; is the perfect title for this novel, because that is what the novel is about.  This is, of course, the second installment in the authors' alternate Civil War history.  In &quot;Gettysburg-A Novel of the Civil War&quot; the authors tell the story of an alternate history in which Lee defeated Meade by flanking him at Gettysburg.  Now, in this second novel, Lee marches on Washington and Baltimore as Grant moves to the Eastern theater to take command of Union forces after Lee's defeat of General Meade.  No spoilers here.<br />I liked this one better than &quot;Gettysburg-A Novel of the Civil War.&quot;  I felt that the writing was better and the novel was actually more plausible.  In &quot;Gettysburg&quot; Lee does everything right, and Meade does about everything wrong.  This offended my sense of fairness, since I happen to believe that Meade thoroughly out-generalled Lee at Gettysburg, and would not have done the stupid things that &quot;Gettysburg&quot; has him doing.  In &quot;Grant Comes East&quot; most of the characters act more plausibly, with foibles on both sides.  The authors do paint a pretty negative picture of General Sickles.  I don't know enough about him to really have an opinion as to whether this is fair or not.<br />The prose in the novel is good, and the authors did a good job of keeping me turning the pages--I truly wanted to know what was going to happen next, and the novel kept me guessing.  The storyline moves at a very brisk pace with no draggy interludes. This one is less predictable than was &quot;Gettysburg.&quot;  Nothing offended my sense of credulity, as &quot;Gettysburg&quot; did at times.  By the way, the authors' treatment of Lincoln is very compelling and seemed to me to be true to life.  Judah Benjamin (Secretary of State of the Confederacy) and Jefferson Davis are also nicely done here as well.<br />Overall, there is a great deal to like about this novel and series.  Again, I liked this second installment quite a bit better than I did the first.  We all now impatiently await the third installment of the series.quite a bit better than I did the first.

China is governed by feuding warlords, and its foreign trade is dominated by foreign &quot;treaty powers&quot; including the USA, Japan, and the leading European nations, all of which maintain strong naval and marine forces in China to maintain their positions and protect foreign persons and property.<br />The novel takes place on an obsolete, barely functioning American river gunboat, the &quot;San Pablo,&quot; known to her crew as the &quot;Sand Pebble.&quot;  The protagonist, Jake Holman, is an engineer-crewman aboard the Sand Pebble.  Jake has a passion for mastering the ship's engines, but initially is frustrated by the fact that aboard the Sand Pebble each American sailor has a Chinese coolie understudy who in fact does almost all of the work aboard ship.  The Sand Pebble crewmen have delegated almost all of the ship's routine to a shadow crew of Chinese coolies, and do very little actual work.  Jake's frustration with the coolie-understudy system and his attempt to fit in with the Sand Pebble crew are part of the main theme of the novel.<br />The real story of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is, however, the emergence of China as a modern nation.  The Kuomantang Chinese Nationalist movement is becoming ascendant in China as the novel unfolds, and it seeks to sweep away foreign influence, and the warlord system that has kept China weak and divided.  The officers and crew of the &quot;Sand Pebble,&quot; in common with the other foreign military forces, must deal with this new movement, which seeks to change Old China, which had seemed eternally unchangeable.  The slow understanding by the foreigners, including the Sand Pebble, that this change is real and something that must be dealt with, is the real story in the novel.<br />Author McKenna does a masterful job of presenting China as it was in the 1920s, together with life in the American gunboat navy of those times.  This is a novel rich with detail and atmosphere.  Both the American and Chinese protagonists are presented with dignity and insight, making this a very interesting read.  While the storyline of crewman Holman is interesting enough, this is only an excuse to tell the real story--the transformation of China.<br />This novel will reward the patient reader.

In the future, the author postulates, a group of highly-trained and exceptional persons known as &quot;Extrapolators&quot; exist, specifically exempted from all restrictions and laws for the purpose of solving problems.  Extrapolators (or &quot;Es&quot; as they are called) are trained to think &quot;outside the box&quot; and not be bound by preexisting and unproven notions.  Mark Clifton proposes the intriguing concept that mankind's beliefs about the universe are distorted by mankind's anthrocentric viewpoint.  From the time of the first sentient human beings, he notes, the universe appeared to be centered on the individual human being, the sun revolved around the earth, etc.  Slowly, Clifton notes, mankind has managed to correct this erroneous thinking.  In the novel, that is the job of the &quot;E&quot; when dealing with problems.<br />The basic storyline here deals with a specific problem.  An Earth colony on a distant planet loses communication with the Earth.  A junior E is dispatched to deal with the problem.  Earth Government factions want him to fail, as their first assault on the authority of the Es, who they resent for the fact that the Es are not under the authority of the Government.  This all combines to make for a very interesting story with an imaginative ending.<br />Despite its intellectually-oriented theme, this is a well-written novel that is not at all heavy going for the reader.  Clifton writes with clarity and simplicity.  There is a solid plot and storyline here, and no shortage of both imagination and humor.  I first read this book as a teenager.  I recently picked it up again, and found that there was more here than I had appreciated at the younger age.  This is a truly fine novel, with something to say, and does a superb job saying it.<br />This is one to keep in your personal library.one to keep in your personal library.	2004-06-01

America and Japan are vital allies and trading partners and I am confident that the two countries will never again engage in armed conflict with one another.  A limited form of armed conflict between Japan and the United States is the intriguing premise of this novel, one of Clancy's best.  Although unlikely, there is nothing that takes place in this novel that is quite impossible.  Just not real probable, but hey, that's why we have fiction.<br />The basic storyline is simple (no spoilers here).  The trade friction between Japan and the United States comes to a head when the US enacts a trade bill which essentially targets Japanese firms which engage in sharp practices against the US.  This gives a clique of power-wielding industrialists an opportunity to put Japan on a course whereby it seeks to establish military control over much of the Western Pacific area, including Saipan, which is a United States territory.  Therein lies the story.  Far out, but not impossible.  Here, Clancy is stretching his imaginative muscles and the result is a quite good novel.  As usual, Clancy's skillful speculation about, and knowledge of, military technology gives this one more authenticity than most authors would be able to manage.<br />This one brings back our old friends Jack Ryan, John Clark, and Ding Chavez, who are the central players on the American side.  This novel features some of Clancy's best writing, and is not overlong like most of his later works.  Further, the Japanese side is presented largely with respect and dignity, excepting the core bad guys who are portrayed as well, bad guys.<br />One of Clancy's best, and if you like his other ones, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this one.	2004-05-30
US	46160224	RCMHE3A0172BB	0425191184	17508097	Red Rabbit (Tom Clancy)	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	A novel of the early Jack Ryan	If you are a fan of Tom Clancy's \\"Jack Ryan\\" series of novels, you will likely enjoy this one. \\"Red Rabbit\\" deals with the Cold War circa 1980-82 when Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher are in office. Jack Ryan is a junior but rising star in the CIA, assigned temporarily to Britain's Century House (their counterpart to CIA headquarters.) The plot centers around the Pope's threat to resign from office and return to Poland to be with his people as they struggle against Communist oppression. The Soviet Politburo resolves to assassinate the Pope, and a high-level KGB official seeks to defect. No spoilers here. All of this is of course straight from the history books of the late Cold War era.<br /><br />This is a slower novel than some of Clancy's earlier works, such as Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October. This one is really designed to acquaint the Jack Ryan fan with the period in Ryan's career just after he joined the CIA (following the events of Patriot Games) and also to familiarize the reader with the Foley CIA team. The plot moves at a more leisurely pace than some readers will like. However, the novel held my interest throughout. It has many intelligent insights concerning the nature of the late Soviet-era USSR and Cold-War intelligence operations.<br /><br />Readers in favor of more Government control over health care may be put off by Clancy's characterization of the British national health system, which was pretty negative. This contrasts with Clancy's otherwise generally Anglophile perspective--Clancy is an unabashed believer that the Brits are America's firmest, most competent, and traditional ally.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably a more realistic look at intelligence operations than most spy novels, and for that reason it moves much more slowly than readers of the genre are accustomed to. But this is a very decent read for a lazy afternoon. I went back and forth as to whether to award this one three stars or four. There is no doubt that this novel suffers from Clancy's increasing tendency to write excessively long novels (The Bear and the Dragon shows this symptom in its terminal phase.) I give it three stars because although it always held my interest, it is far too long. On the plus side, the novel contains intelligent insights concerning the late stages of the Cold War.

Why this one did not receive greater acclaim is a mystery, because this is a powerful, well-written, even compelling story dealing with ancient Rome.  Without spoiling the plot, it is simple enough: by entirely plausible scientific means, a Roman gladiator is revived in the modern age.  His flashbacks to life in ancient Rome and his impressions of the modern age are all woven into a compelling plot that moves at lightning speed to a startling and yet wistful conclusion.  This is a great story.<br />Sapir's prose is superb.  Many authors have trouble switching from first-person narration to a third-person perspective as Sapir does in this novel, but Sapir does it effortlessly. The storyline never drags.  The novel has a wonderful sense of authenticity that causes the ancient Roman Empire to become real to the reader.  Sapir's characterizations are excellent as well. Eugeni, the Roman gladiator and the other leading characters all become real people about whom the reader will come to care a great deal.  Put simply, there is very little about this novel not to like.<br />I own two copies of this one and would never part with either--I consider this to be one of the very best novels I have ever read.  The discerning reader will want to read and keep this one in his or her personal library.	2004-05-22

I have an open mind about the possibility that Earth and mankind have been the subject of visits from other civilizations.  It is at least possible.  It is also possible that the US Government knows more than it is telling.  This is the premise of &quot;Alien Rapture&quot; and I had hoped that this novel would live up to its expectation: that it would constitute intelligent speculation about what might really be going on.<br />No such luck.  First, the writing itself.  The novel is written in a remarkably poor manner, almost at a sub-professional level.  The storyline is jerky, the characters are cardboard, one-dimensional figures, and the book is riddled with cliche's.  I won't give away the ending except to say that I found it to be laughable.<br />The author's speculations about US aircraft based upon alien technology were uninteresting and uninspired.  So were the author's attempts to weave known historical events into his premise that various governmental figures of the past knew The Truth.  It may very well be the case that the government knows more than it is telling the public.  This novel, however, fails to present a convincing story or case about this to the reader.  It mainly contains warmed-over speculations based upon the &quot;Roswell Incident&quot; and old speculations about Area 51.  Nothing new here.<br />Overall a disappointment.  I do not understand the various other glowing Amazon reviews.  I gave this one two stars instead of one only because I was able to finish it.	2004-05-19

Poul Anderson is at his best when writing about this subject, and most of these stories are truly excellent.  In fact, the only reason I deprived this one of a fifth star is that one or two of the stories were not Anderson's best.  But make no mistake: most of these stories are worthy of five stars.<br />There are many different scenarios in this collection, and several of them are outstanding both for the quality of Anderson's writing, which is almost always superlatively good, to the sheer imagination that went into the stories.  &quot;The Pugilist&quot; is an utterly brilliant work dealing with a future in which the United States has been subdued and brought into the Soviet bloc.  The story postulates an utterly believable scenario and Anderson vividly shows how such a thing might have been.  Its question: can the country re-acquire its former love of liberty and freedom?  Or has dictatorship and oppression taken root too firmly?  Anderson asks the right questions.  The ending packs a formidable punch.  In &quot;Among Thieves&quot; Anderson takes us to the far future, when mankind has spread amongst numerous stellar systems, but has not outgrown the institution of war.  Here, once again, his speculations as to the possible reasons for, and nature of, future conflict make for a superb story.<br />Anderson really cared about both the causes of, and forms of, human conflict, and the depth of his concern is what makes this collection a superb one that most readers will thoroughly enjoy.	2004-05-18

Nelson DeMille is my favorite novelist, bar none, and I have read every single one of his books, and enjoyed them all.  &quot;Up Country&quot; is a good solid read, although it is not his best novel, in my opinion.<br />In &quot;Up Country&quot; our old friend Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner (from &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;) comes out of retirement from the Army Criminal Investigation Division to handle an investigation of a 25+ year-old murder.  The catch: the murder occurred in Vietnam, at the height of the Tet offensive.  This requires Brenner to return to postwar Vietnam, resulting in a nostalgic series of flashbacks as Brenner pursues his investigation while reliving the fighting in the war in which he participated.  The ending packs a notable punch, causing this to be a successful novel.<br />Critics of this novel by and large have noted that it is a lot longer than it needs to be in order to sustain the plot.  I agree with this criticism.  This novel is almost an excuse for DeMille to tell the stories of the Tet offensive, the Khe Sahn standoff, and other big battles of the Vietnam War.  DeMille is a veteran of that war himself, as all of his devoted fans are aware, and Brenner's reliving of various aspects of the conflicts have a stark authenticity that adds a great deal to the novel.  Fellow vets will doubtless be intrigued, the rest of us at least interested and entertained.  However, it is a fact that this book moves at a very slow pace, without the usual rapidity of most of DeMille's other novels.  For DeMille lovers (myself included) this is a plus, for most of us cannot get enough of DeMille's writing.  Others may find that the storyline drags in portions of the novel, and lacks the focus and pace that characterizes the best novels (including most of DeMille's).<br />Brenner is the same wise, sarcastic, and very bright character that we all loved in &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; and this vivid characterization, a DeMille trademark, gets the reader through the slow parts of the story.  Overall, &quot;Up Country&quot; does three things.  It spins a good yarn, does an excellent job revisiting some aspects of the Vietnam War, and acquaints the reader with certain aspects of the modern Vietnamese nation.

I first read it when I was in Middle School, and it made quite an impression on me as a fantastic story with a wild premise, well-told.  Picking it up thirty-five years later, the novel has lost none of its punch or impact.  This is a true science fiction classic.<br />The premise of the novel is simple enough:  Earth is being visited by warring factions of a monstrously large inter-galactic conflict.  Each side views Earth as an obscure planet of limited importance, much as the US Navy might have viewed certain obscure islands in the Pacific during the Second World War.  The protagonists become caught up in this conflict in a very interesting way.  More would be telling, but suffice to say, this is a really interesting story, and its premise has not been done better (to my knowledge) in any science fiction novels that have come later.<br />This one is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good science fiction.	2004-05-06

George Orwell's classic essentially seeks to portray life in what amounts to the ultimate totalitarian state.  The most terrifying thing about the novel is that nothing in it is at all far-fetched.  Other totalitarian states have approached Orwell's \\"Oceania\\" in the thoroughness of their oppression and the ruthlessness of their grip on power.  Soviet Russia, Maoist China, and Nazi Germany all come to mind, and all shared many traits with Orwell's fictional tyranny. In 1984 Orwell describes precisely how the ultimate totalitarian state would operate, what life under it would be like, and why it might never be possible for human beings to overthrow it.<br />The novel shows life through the eyes of one individual, Winston Smith, a citizen of Oceania, living in Britain, now renamed \\"Airstrip One.\\"  Life in Oceania is unspeakably bleak, with even most of the elite living at or near the poverty line.  Shortages of everything are the norm, as the government controls all aspects of the economy with no free market even dreamed of.  Love is forbidden other than love of the \\"Party\\" and \\"Big Brother,\\" the Party's leader.  Loyalty to the Party is enforced by the Thought Police, whose job is to ferret out anyone who does not conform to the requirements of fealty and single-minded devotedness to the Party.  Since Winston is such a one, in the novel he is in trouble.  By the way, despite being a political novel intended to make a point, 1984 is also a very readable story in its own right.  Orwell's prose is excellent, and the storyline moves along briskly.  This is a very dark story, however, with suffering characters and an unspeakably bleak outlook.  Part of this is said to be reflective of the fact that Orwell himself was in failing health when he wrote the novel.  In any case, this is not an uplifting novel, for all its importance.  The theme of the novel is more or less summarized when a Party leader explains to Winston that the image of the world for the rest of all time, may be summarized as a booted foot stomping on a human face.<br />1984 has had a powerful effect on Western political thought, as a warning about the effects of giving government too much power.

This is perhaps not the greatest novel ever written about World War Two, but it may be the most readable.  This is an engrossing, ingenious, and well-written story of ordinary men at sea, placed in an uncommon predicament.  Their predicament is simple: their captain is a spectacularly bad leader.  This leads to consequences that Wouk develops brilliantly.  Wouk's own experience in the US Navy gives this book a gritty authentic feel.  The reader really gets a flavor of what it must have been like to be a junior US Naval officer aboard a destroyer-minesweeper.  The discussions of officer efficiency reports, the codebreaking duty, casual discipline, and more, all ring true.<br />The real story is the maturation of Willie Keith.  At the beginning of the novel he is a spoiled, overprivileged lad living an aimless life.  His time in the service, and the unusual predicament in which he finds himself, hardens him into a true fighting-man in a way that has happened to countless thousands of servicemen.  Wouk tells this story exceedingly well, in a manner that most readers will be able to easily relate to.  I found this novel to be an unusually good read primarily for this reason.  Wouk's writing is first-rate, and it is easy to see why this novel appealed to readers of the early 1950s, many of them with fresh memories of World War Two.  The flavor of that war lingers in the novel even today, and gives the twenty-first century reader a notion of what those times were like.<br />This is altogether a remarkably good novel, deserving of every one of its five stars.	2004-04-29

Throughout, the novel switches perspectives from that of a German lieutnant to an American private.  The story begins shortly before the outbreak of war, and continues until the war's ending.<br />Irwin Shaw seems to capture the flavor of both the American and German armies, and what the attitudes and perspectives of their soldiers might have been like.  One thing that Shaw cannot be criticized for is soft-peddling the crimes of the German Army.  One of the things the reader will see is the slow descent of the German protagonist from an essentially good man to a thorough skunk.  Personally, I thought Shaw might have overdone it a little bit (just my opinion).  To clarify: I thought it might have been more effective to show the German soldier as a basically good man caught up in an organization committing wrongful deeds.  Instead, Shaw chose to have the character himself become evil.  Well, that's the author's choice to make, and Shaw certainly tells a compelling story.<br />This is an engaging story that has a strong authentic feel to it.  I found it to be a rich reading experience and this is one of the truly great stories of World War II.	2004-04-24

What can one say about one of the most famous novels of all time dealing with the US Army?  This novel is a very authentic look at what a life and career in the pre-WW2 US Army was like.  The Army was riven with politics and waiting for a great war to begin. Jones tells an interesting tale of soldiers and officers in the US Army at Pearl Harbor and what their lives were like.<br />Put simply, the novel tells the story of a company of soldiers at Scofield Barracks, Hawaii shortly before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.  The Army is sleepy, not primed for war.  The officers advance by politicking and one of the ways to politick in the peacetime Army was to have one's company do well in the divisional sports competition.  The protagonist is a talented boxer who does not want to box.  This turns into a test of wills between him and his company commander, who wants another boxing star in his company.  There is much more to the story; this is a long and complex novel.  The basic theme is that the Army in those days was a small, sleepy institution that would have to be (and was) transformed radically in order to take on the Axis.  The novel is an interesting look at the Army as it was in those days.<br />Jones' writing is excellent and his characterizations are strong.  The reader will come to care deeply about the various protagonists.  This is a great story.  My only criticism is that the book does not feature an uplifting or happy ending, and really, this is something of a dark and unhappy story.	2004-04-24

Most Grisham books can be described as having weak characterization but a strong plot or theme (&quot;The Firm&quot; comes to mind).  Not this one.  Basically, as I read this book, I kept waiting for there to be an actual plot.  Forget it.  There is no plot to speak of.<br />Basically (no spoiler here) the protagonist's father is an honest but tyrannical judge.  He dies.  The protagonist finds a whole lot of cash money in his estate that cannot be explained.  Can't be bribes because the judge was honest.  So where did the money come from?  That's the &quot;plot.&quot;  You get this in the first few pages.  I won't &quot;spoil&quot; the rest, except that there is hardly any more to spoil.<br />This is one of Grisham's weaker books.  It was readable, and his description of the &quot;King of Torts&quot; lawyer was funny, if stereotypical.  But make no mistake, there isn't much of a story here.  It is almost as though Grisham lost interest in this one even as he was writing it.<br />I'll give it two stars because it was not so bad that I didn't finish it.	2004-04-24

It essentially paints a very plausible scenario (that turned out wrong, as it happens) of how the old USSR might have changed governmental systems.<br />The novel is centered around a Soviet GRU agent stationed in the United States (&quot;Sasha&quot;).  Sasha has an agenda, even as he becomes a competent agent working for the Soviet regime as an intelligence officer in the United States.  The novel crackles with authenticity.  Moss plainly did his homework, and draws heavily on other works including the well-known &quot;Inside the GRU&quot; by Victor Suvorov.  The writing is excellent, the storyline moves briskly, and the key characters have depth and plausibility.<br />This is one of my favorite spy novels and remains so, even if it is the case that the old USSR imploded under a scenario somewhat different than that set forth here.  Moss's speculation along these lines was intelligent and insightful, and better than most.<br />Overall, a great read and an intelligent look at international espionage in the context of the bad old days of the Cold War.	2004-04-15

Nelson DeMille is my favorite author, and The Gold Coast is one of his better books.  This is a hilarious novel.  The basic premise is simple enough.  John Sutter is an upper-class WASP lawyer who lives in the most exclusive area in America, an area in Long Island known to insiders as &quot;The Gold Coast.&quot;  He has a beautiful wife, an OK law practice, looks, class, and health.  All seems well.  Then, the local Mafia Don decides to move into the property next to the Sutters.  And so begins the tale of a mid-life crisis to beat all mid-life crises.  The rest would be telling.<br />As is the case with many of DeMille's novels, John Sutter is a hoot.  His insights into life in general, the Gold Coast in particular, and his encounters with the local Mafia Don are very funny.  The novel is written in first person, not a perspective I always like, but here it is extraordinarily effective.  The reader comes to know, like, and care about John Sutter and his deepening predicament.  DeMille's prose is superb.  The writing is clear and crisp.  The storyline starts out at a leisurely pace, but it always keeps the reader's attention and interest, and the plot quickly picks up momentum.  This is an absorbing and very funny story.<br />DeMille is one of the great novelists of the times.  I do not exaggerate; many of his books in my opinion are instant classics.  The Gold Coast is one of these.	2004-04-15

The basic plot (no spoiler here) is a tobacco trial in which the plaintiff is suing a Big Tobacco firm for product liability--for causing the death of her husband.  Both sides are determined to control the jury and its verdict anyway they can.  There is much more to the story than that, which makes this a quite decent read.<br />Although The Runaway Jury is entertaining, it lacks depth.  None of the characters have any real substance.  Even the protagonists (there are several) are kept at a distance from the reader and we never get to know them.  Except for Fitch, the defense jury consultant, all of the main characters are utterly forgettable, and the reader will likely not come to care for any of them.<br />As in most of Grisham's novels, Grisham's experience and knowledge of the law shines through.  The reader is treated to a variety of insights about the trial process, and the world of civil litigation.  This authenticity is Grisham's trademark, and combined with a snappy and clear writing style, yields a novel that succeeds in entertaining the reader.  The plot is fairly predictable, however, and this combined with the colorless characters robs the novel's conclusion of any real punch.	2004-04-14

It is the story of a young law student-then lawyer who is trying to make it in the legal profession; specifically, in the world of small-time civil litigation.  Young Rudy Baylor lucks into a fairly big-time case, and the fun begins.<br />Grisham gives us a cynical, funny, and mostly authentic look at the law.  Oh, there are a few flaws.  I doubt many judges would ever favor one side as much as the judge did in this novel, although I suppose such things happen (I've seen it once.)  But overall, Grisham gives the reader a more or less accurate look at the world of civil litigation.  This give the novel a gritty sense of realism that carries the reader through what is mostly an excellent read.  There are some hilarious pieces to the story--I love that &quot;paralawyer&quot; guy.  And Grisham's cynical portrayal of big firm lawyers hits the mark.  This is a very funny book.<br />One of Grisham's better ones.  By the way, the novel is quite a bit better than the movie.	2004-04-14

I do not bestow these oft-overused adjectives lightly.  This is a story of deep, rich, and forbidden love, betrayal, tragedy, and ambition.  This is a truly wonderful story set primarily in Australia, circa 1915 and then spanning several generations to the post World War II era.  McCullough writes a sprawling story which primarily centers on the forbidden love between an extraordinary woman and a good but ambitious priest.<br />This is the story of the Cleary family, originally from Ireland, who emigrate first to New Zealand, and early on, to Australia.  The young Cleary daughter, Meggie, falls in love with the local Catholic priest, Ralph de Briccasart, who is a good and ambitious man who certainly does nothing to encourage this love, but who certainly returns it as he regards Meggie as the daughter he can never have.  As Meggie matures, he comes to regard her in a more romantic way.  A great struggle arises between this love on the one hand (&quot;the forbidden rose&quot;) and his ambition to become a Cardinal or perhaps more, on the other.<br />There is much, much, more to the story than this, however.  The novel transports the reader to Australia, and makes that country a real place to those of us who have never been there.  This is also the story of the struggles of the Cleary family, as they battle with, and come to love, the rich outback country of Australia.  This is an extraordinarily authentic and moving story that any review (or at least this one) can only fail to do justice.<br />McCullough's prose is simply outstanding, and her characters crackle with realism--they become utterly real people and the reader will become swept away with this wonderful story.  The storyline never drags, and at no point does this novel ever fail to completely capture the reader's attention.  This novel is not only a classic; it is a ripping good read!  If you have not yet enjoyed this novel, you are in for a wonderful reading experience.erience.	2004-04-08

This is the book that made John Grisham famous, and it is a ripping good read.  By now who doesn't know the basic outline of the plot?  Mitch McDeere, a top Harvard Law grad, is recruited into a small, exclusive, Memphis law firm.  The perks are incredible: they buy him a BMW, set him up in a beautiful home, pay off his huge student loan, and promise to make him rich.  What's not to like?<br />Quite a bit, as it turns out, and that a basic summary of the ingredients of an engaging and exciting read.  No spoilers here: if you have somehow managed to spend the last 10 years or so on Mars and don't know the story, I won't ruin it for you here.  Suffice to say, the story has more twists and turns than a pretzel, but Grisham does a good job of keeping it all together.  The storyline never plods--it races.  This is a wonderful read, and a very creative tale.  Grisham's background as a lawyer shines through.  His observations as regards the practice of law are as insightful as they are cynical.  They are also largely true, at least for some lawyers some of the time. (I'm a lawyer myself, God forgive me, grin.)<br />As far as being a good read goes, this book rates five stars, or even six.  It is not &quot;great literature&quot; by most reckonings, which is the only reason I deprive it here of that fifth star.  The reader will not miss that fifth star, and this is a novel that no reader should pass up.  This is one of those novels that you will be reading until three in the morning.  Enjoy it if you already have not.  Or even if you have: I've read my copy a half a dozen times.	2004-04-08

This is a timeless and much-loved novel of leadership, struggle, and adventure!  A group of individuals, dissatisfied with the government of their \\"country,\\" and receiving prophesies of its doom, decide to leave and start a colony elsewhere.  The individuals, of course, are rabbits, who are confronted with all the dangers of the \\"elil.\\"  The \\"elil\\" means their enemies, known to the rabbits as \\"the thousand\\" meaning the infinite number of enemies, i.e. foxes, hawks, etc. who prey on rabbits.  The most dangerous elil, of course, is man.<br />This is a wonderful novel that discusses the nature of leadership, teamwork, individual achievement, and struggle, as the protagonists seek to set up a new colony free of dangers from man as well as \\"elil\\" and even other hostile rabbits.  Their leader, Hazel, is neither the strongest (Bigwig is that) or the cleverest (Blackberry is that) but nevertheless we come to see why he is the emergent leader to whom the others look for guidance and inspiration.  This is a fine study in leadership.<br />The novel never loses sight of its main objective, which is to entertain.  This is a fascinating, well-written tale.  The storyline moves at a brisk pace, punctuated with interesting episodes of struggle and insight, which always add to, rather than distract from, the main plot.  The reader will come to care deeply about the various individual characters of the novel, cheer them in success and root for them in adversity.  Adams' prose is superb.  This book is a pleasure to read.<br />This is a novel that adults will appreciate and young readers will love.  It is indeed written at an adult level, but Adams' writing is so clear and crisp that younger readers will also appreciate and enjoy the novel.  This is a timeless and classic novel that belongs in one's personal library and which most readers will enjoy reading repeatedly from time to time, and share with the younger readers in the family.	2004-04-08

I have always believed that the First World War ranks as one of mankind's most tragic and unnecessary mistakes.  This book does a fine job explaining at least a portion of how this tragedy came about, at least from the naval angle and perspective.  This book has enough detail to satisfy experts, but is written in a fashion that the more casual reader with an interest in history will both enjoy and benefit from reading.  This is indeed a fascinating look at an underexamined subject.<br />Mr. Massie's basic thesis is that Germany's construction of a great war fleet (the misnamed &quot;High Seas Fleet&quot;) was a disaster for the country.  Kaiser Wilhelm appears to have caused his country to build this fleet for reasons of prestige and national pride.  But to Britain the existence of the High Seas Fleet was a challenge to Britain's national survival, for Britain's domination of the seas, and prevention thereof by any possible hostile power, was not merely a matter of prestige or pride.  It was life and death.  By building a huge fleet at immense cost, Germany produced a dagger aimed at England's heart.  As someone observed, without domination of the seas, England was finished as a power, but without domination of the seas, Germany remained the foremost European power by virtue of its army and position on the European continent.  The existence of the German fleet at the onset of hostilities essentially guaranteed and necessitated England's entry into the Great War on the allied side.  Once Germany began waging the war at sea--a war it did not really need to fight--this guaranteed eventual American entry into the war, which in turn inevitably tipped the balance against her.  Seen from this perspective, the construction of her fleet was a strategic disaster for Germany.<br />The book is interesting for both its narrative and insight into the famous sea battles of the war, as well as for its discussion of great naval leaders.  The reader will learn about admirals Jellicoe and Beatty, men who became legends in their own lifetimes.  While most of us are familiar with Winston Churchill's later career as Britain's great war leader in the Second World War, many readers will be delighted to learn about Churchill's pivotal role in the First World War.  The author's insights here are fascinating and controversial, but to me ring true.<br />Although this book has perhaps more detail than non-specialists necessarily want or need, it is a relatively easy read due to the author's clear, crisp style of writing, and his interesting look at not just the facts, but also the personalities, of the naval aspect of the great war.  For readers interested in learning about both the causes of the great war, and the battles at sea that comprised it, this is the book to read.and Beatty, men who became legends in their own lifetimes.

The Charm School is my favorite Cold War novel of all time and one of my favorite novels of any genre, ever.  This is a powerful, well-written, and disturbing novel of Cold War intrigue.  It takes place in the old Soviet Union circa 1988, and DeMille's research about, and visits to, the USSR around this time have given this novel an authenticity that resonates throughout the novel.  DeMille captures the tension of the Cold War conflict, the sorrow of the Russian people and the contradictions in the old Soviet state (&quot;with gravel roads, ICBMs, and a world-class Secret Police service...&quot;).  This is a superb novel.<br />Without committing any spoilers, the plot is simple, powerful, and disturbing.  Two US diplomats in the Soviet Union discover a terrible secret: that over 1000 US MIA pilots shot down over Vietnam have been spirited away to Russia.  The purpose is to allow the Soviets to set up &quot;Mrs. Ivanova's Charm School&quot; which is a KGB academy in which the pilots are forced to teach aspiring Russian spies how to act, speak, and pass as Americans.  The KGB will go to literally any lengths to keep the existence of &quot;The Charm School&quot; a secret.  The rest would be telling.  This is a great story.<br />DeMille literally transports the reader to Soviet-era Russia.  His prose dealing with the Russian people, the Soviet government, the vast country, and the long-suffering people to me seemed to capture at least some of the essence of that great and troubled country.  The novel moves at a fast-pace without racing to the finish; the reader is allowed to &quot;smell the flowers&quot; along the way, but the storyline never drags.  This novel manages to do what very few novels ever succeed in doing: it is a classic of its genre, as well as a ripping page turner.<br />&quot;The Charm School&quot; ranks with DeMille's &quot;Word of Honor&quot; as a true masterpiece that belongs in every reader's library.	2004-04-02

If the United States were to implement a \\"required reading\\" prerequisite to voting, this is the book I would choose for such a requirement.  Sowell's thinking is crystal clear, his analysis is linear, and his conclusions, once you read them, are hard to argue with.  In my opinion, Sowell is dead-on on just about every subject he tackles.  This is a brilliant man.<br />Prof. Sowell's main thesis is simple enough: we must look at the actual consequences of policies rather than merely the intentions.  Unfortunately, on issue after issue, Sowell shows us that many of our so-called \\"elites\\" focus only on good intentions, because intentions are what the voters see first (the wreckage of bad policy comes later).<br />Nationalized health care, which is a reality in many liberal democratic states, and something that the United States may be moving towards, epitomizes Sowell's basic thesis.  What could involve better intentions than the notion that everyone should be able to receive all the health care resources that they need?  Alas for complacency! Sowell makes a pretty strong case that when such policies are put into practice, shortages, a degradation in services, and an end to innovation are the consequences.<br />Sowell is right-of-center; unabashedly so, and of course this may turn off some readers.  But really, anyone will enjoy reading this book because Sowell's clarity of writing equals his clarity of thought--the book is a joy to read simply for its straightforwedness.  This is a book capable of challenging one's belief system.  Not many books can do that, but this is one of them.	2004-03-29

The Roman Republic is a subject that anyone with an interest in history finds compelling, because of both the differences and similarities between Rome and modern-day democratic states.  I have read a number of books and novels that dealt with late-Republican Rome (including the entire &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series by Colleen McCullough) but I never found a book that really explained to my satisfaction how and why the Roman Republic finally failed.  Until this one.<br />Author Tom Holland writes with a clear, penetrating style that immediately captured my attention and held it throughout.  This is not a dry summary of history.  It is an analytical tracing and analysis of key events in late Roman Republican history that explain why Rome was able to expand its power so dramatically and how the power that this expansion brought ultimately contained the seeds of the Republic's demise.<br />Holland explains Republican Rome as it apparently was: a contradiction in which democratic institutions were cherished within a society that was characterized with a ruling aristocracy and a severe, almost inescapable class structure.  Although Roman society produced the occasional Cicero as an example of a non-upper class boy making good, most of its leaders came from the great aristocratic families of Rome--a sure sign that a man's class imposed huge barriers or advantages.  And women?  They had influence but were not permitted to hold any office in the Republic other than certain religious posts.<br />Holland shows us that Republican Rome was simply too aggressive, avaracious, and warlike to live in peace with its neighbors, and because of its phenomenal military competence eventually it came to dominate most of the (Roman) known world.  This enabled Rome's great leaders such as Sulla, Pompey, and eventually Caesar, to amass sufficient power such that these men literally could overpower the rest of the Roman state.  The fears of the early leaders of Republican Rome, that amassing an empire would endanger Rome's ancient liberties, were finally seen to have been well-founded.  Holland explains this and much more brilliantly.  In fact, Holland succeeds in explaining the causes of the demise of the Republic to my satisfaction, at least.<br />Holland does not attempt to &quot;politicize&quot; Roman history by seeking to draw analogies between Rome and modern-day political issues.  By leaving this exercise to each of his readers, Holland succeeds in producing a wonderful, thoughtful, and penetrating look at the Roman Republic and the reasons for its descent into tyranny.ing an empire would endanger Rome's ancient liberties, were finally seen to have been well-founded.

In fact, there is a lot not to like about it.  First of all, the novel is historically inaccurate in so many ways that one does not know where to begin.  Cicero was not a worshipper of Jehova (the Jewish/Christian/Islamic God) as this book would make it seem.  In point of fact, this book makes a conscious effort to make Cicero seem more \\"American.\\"  It does so at the cost of both historical accuracy and pleasure of reading.  In my opinion, the best books about Rome are those that make Rome seem, well, Roman.  This one fails.  Except for the togas, the Roman Senate in this book could be the one in Washington DC.<br />The book makes other pompous analogies between Rome and the United States.  I found none of them to be insightful.  The writing here, by the way, is at about an eighth grade level.  This one might be OK as a novel to get children interested in Roman history; a worthwhile goal.  But this novel is not itself a good source of Roman history and the discriminating reader will pass it by.  Try McCullough's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series (novels) or Tom Holland's superb \\"Rubicon\\" for an analysis of late Republican Rome.	2004-03-29
US	46160224	R6W92D2MQXFLY	0671676695	625705674	Red Army	Books	4	21	29	N	N	Plausible, but the Soviets were not ten feet tall.	I was a field artillery officer in the US Army in Germany during the height of the Cold War, and of course we spent a great deal of time thinking about the Soviet Army and the threat it represented.  This novel does a fairly good job of presenting what a conventional war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO might have been like--using one set of assumptions.  Specifically, this novel assumes that the Soviet Army would function pretty much as its leadership intended.<br />My personal belief is that although this book is plausible, it is unlikely that the Soviets would have had the easy run into the heart of Germany that this novel envisioned.  Anywhere during the 1970s or 1980s that the Soviet military or its surrogates went up against an American-style force, the Soviet force did very poorly.  Contrast the two month American liberation of Taliban Afghanistan with the utter inability of the Soviet Army to prevail over the same adversary despite trying for eight years with far more numerous forces.  A modest supply of American Stinger missiles and TOW rockets immobilized and thwarted the Soviets.  In Germany the number and sophistication of such weapons, and the skill of the NATO soldiers, would have been immeasurably higher.  It doesn't seem likely given what happened in Afhanistan that the Soviets would have had an easy time of it against NATO's well-drilled, well-equipped forces.  Similarly, whenever a Soviet-style air force went up against a US-trained one, such as Israel's, the result was a debacle for the Soviet side.  In short, in the 1970s and 1980s there is not a single example of Soviet tactics or equipment coming out on top against any Western army or air force.  Just look at what happened when the American Army went up against Iraq's Soviet-style, Soviet-equipped army.  The Russian tanks were nearly helpless against American Abrams and British Crusader tanks.  Why would Europe have been any different?  It would not have been.<br />Despite the above opinion, which is strictly my own, this is an interesting and thoughtful novel even in the post-Soviet era.  We will never be sure that the West could have prevailed against the Soviet Army.  Certainly the author makes an excellent case, and weaves a fascinating story of a military-political assault against the West by the Soviets.  The novel is eminently readable, never strains the reader's credulity, and I found the political dimension of the novel to be particularly interesting.<br />Overall, this novel in my opinion embodies common Cold War fears that the Soviet Army was stronger than it really was, and is a pretty accurate depiction of those fears.  This makes the novel an insightful look at military attitudes during the bad old days of the Cold War.ich is strictly my own, this is an interesting and thoughtful novel even in the post-Soviet era.

As such, it is a typical John Grisham legal thriller, although, as it happens, it is not one of my favorites.  The plot is relatively simple:  a young lawyer discovers that a close relative of his is on Death Row for the murders of two young kids, who were accidental victims of an intended murder aimed at a civil rights worker.  (The children were the intended victim's children).  No question that the bomb was either intended to or likely to kill people.  Just not the two kids.  The young protagonist then resolves to defend the murderer pro bono to try to prevent his execution.<br />The problem with The Chamber, in my opinion, is that it takes the racist murderer of two small boys, and spends the first half of the novel making this man out to be a wretchedly hateful racist.  Now, this is probably accurate in the sense that the people who perpetrated the murders of civil rights workers in the 1950s-1960s certainly were by and large like that.  But then, in the last portion of the novel, the novel does about a 150 degree turn and this man more or less becomes a flawed saint, who flails away at the injustice of the death penalty, and we are all supposed to realize that since this &quot;saint&quot; is about to fall &quot;victim&quot; to the death penalty, the death penalty is somehow unjust.  It just didn't make sense to me.  This guy deserved to die and is precisely the type of wretch that proponents of the death penalty have persuasively argued merit such punishment.  The novel would have made its point much more effectively had the person sentenced to death been wrongly convicted--in my opinion this would have made the novel much more compelling.  Oh, sure (**very minor spoiler**) it turns out that another person is much more involved in the deaths of the two kids than the convicted person, but that doesn't change my feeling that the convict deserved his punishment, and that this caused Grisham to miss his point by a Tennessee mile.<br />The Chamber is not a bad read for all that, although it is too long and too preachy.  Grisham could have made his point much more effectively than he does here, and also written a better and more compelling novel by doing so.t by a Tennessee mile.<br />The Chamber is not a bad read for all that, although it is too long and too preachy.

In my opinion this novel is incomparably better than anything Le Carre has written, meaning no offense.<br />Set in 1945 America, and seen from the perspective of a rookie FBI agent, \\"Firebird\\" is the code name of the FBI's effort to penetrate the Soviet Embassy in Washington and discover how the USSR has managed to steal America's atomic secrets.  Loosely based upon the actual historical events, \\"Firebird\\" takes the reader inside the FBI of the 1940s and the problems it faced in learning to deal with an aggressive Soviet espionage effort that targeted the United States.<br />Author Carroll's prose is outstanding.  The novel has a wistful, thoughtful tone that I found to be immediately captivating.  \\"Firebird\\" is a deeply moving story of a young FBI agent who is recruited for his safecracking talent, and who is tasked with the incredible job of penetrating the Soviet Embassy, opening its code safe, and stealing the \\"one time cipher\\" book there.  The story is compelling and plausible.<br />The novel neither glorifies nor vilifies the FBI and/or J. Edgar Hoover, but instead shows us a picture of counter-espionage in all its grimy details, no warts omitted.  This is a tale of blackmail, trust, idealism, and betrayal. The portrayal of Hoover seems authentic and insightful. One of the highlights of this book was its analysis of the brutal and relentless internal FBI politics and power struggles and their effects on America's counter-espionage efforts in the late 1940s.<br />Despite the serious subject matter of this novel, the story never loses sight of its main job--to entertain and interest the reader.  This is a novel with a compelling plot and a touching love story to boot.  Although the novel does get bogged down a bit in the second third or so of the story, eventually it perks up again, and the reader who sticks it out will be rewarded by having enjoyed a top-notch spy thriller.

This novel deals with the Civil War from its outset to the conclusion.<br />The story traces the activities of the Hazard and Main families, great families deriving from North and South respectively and bound by friendship and marriage, through the nation's bloodiest conflict.  This is an engaging and entertaining story.  Jakes does a good job of showing the reader that the Civil War was probably inevitable given the intractable differences between the North and South, and the stubborness on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.  The story also shows how it came to be that despite the North's numbers and industrial might, it took years for the North to successfully overwhelm the South.<br />This is not a perfect novel.  Despite the overall taut storyline and good prose, Jakes has a tendency to produce exaggerated characters who are almost caricatures of the way people really behave.  While there are doubtless real-life examples of Elkanah Bents, Victoria Hazards, and Justin LaMottes (three principal characters in this series) such exaggerated personages abound in Jakes' world.  Well, it is after all a novel.<br />Overall, this is the second best novel in the series; perhaps not as good as &quot;North and South&quot; but better than &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; which is the third installment.  This novel is well worth reading, and provides an entertaining and insightful look at the Civil War and how it affected ordinary people and the nation as a whole.	2004-03-09

This is a ripping good historical novel about General MacArthur's leadership of the American occupation of Japan--the first time in over a thousand years that the &quot;nation family&quot; of Japan suffered defeat and conquest.  The author tells the story from the perspective of one Jay Marsh, a young Japanese-speaking American captain and aide-de-camp to General MacArthur.  Seen from Marsh's perspective, we see MacArthur from what seemed to me to be an authentic portrayal of a complicated man who was vain, brilliant, ambitious, and charismatic.<br />The essential theme of the novel (no spoilers here) is that in 1945 although MacArthur represented the victor and the Japanese were in fact utterly beaten and indeed devestated by war, the interaction between occupier and the Japanese power structure was complex.  The Japanese ruling class, although forced to endure American-inspired democratic reforms, remained the ruling class, at least for a time.  In particular, the novel shows how, in exchange for the Japanese establishment's cooperation for a remarkably tranquil and calm occupation, most of the truly culpable Japanese war criminals escaped prosecution.  The infamous Rape of Nanking, in particular, largely went unpunished.<br />Although the novel is wonderful history, it never loses sight of its first mission--to entertain.  The story is beautifully told, with compassion and humor, as we follow Captain Marsh through his love affairs with beautiful Phillipine and Japanese girls, and his interaction, friendships, and ultimately his outmaneuverings of key Japanese government figures.  The most rivetting part of the novel, and its central story, is the trial and hanging of Japanese General Yamashita.  Author Webb does an excellent job persuading the reader that this was in fact a travesty of justice in which MacArthur essentially made Yamashita a scapegoat for war crimes committed by others--others in the Japanese power establishment whom MacArthur was shielding from prosecution in exchange for the establishment's cooperation in the occupation and democratic reform process.<br />An unforgettable novel that I have read more than once, each time with added insight and enjoyment.rosecution in exchange for the establishment's cooperation in the occupation and democratic reform process.<br />An unforgettable novel that I have read more than once, each time with added insight and enjoyment.	2004-03-06

This is the tenth installment of Griffin's excellent &#34;The Corps&#34; series.  It takes place after the Inchon landing, where General MacArthur cuts the North Korean supply lines and defeats the North Korean Army in detail.  There are rumblings of Chinese intervention.  MacArthur's intelligence officer, Gen. Willoughby, continues is streak of incompetence by assuring MacArthur that Chinese intervention is not going to happen and there is no reason to believe it will occur.<br /><br />The main events in this novel are that Killer McCoy and his team continue to try to rescue the downed pilot Pick Pickering, and the CIA sets up an independent shop in Korea.  No spoilers here.  I like Griffin's writing, and one of his strong points is that he creates complex characters whose trials and travails engage the reader's interest.  That certainly happens in this novel.<br /><br />My main criticism is that Griffin flat-out does not know how to conclude a series of novels.  This novel ends abruptly, causing the reader to wonder what Book 11 will have in store.  However, amazingly there is no Book 11.  I don't know if Griffin just got tired of the series or what, but this series needs a Book 11 to wrap up many open issues, which issues I will not elaborate on for fear of introducing spoilers.  I just don't understand how a fine writer like Griffin can leave a story hanging like this.  RJB.ater story along these lines.  Griffen does a good enough job here that I'll probably be up for it.	2004-03-06

A true classic!	&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; is an authentic classic political thriller of the first rank.  Authors Baily and Knebel present a scenario in which an unpopular President is targeted by America's top military brass for an actual military takeover of the government.  The story is complex, but vividly presented with an authenticity that is both disturbing and plausible.  The reader is brought to understand that it could happen here, and the story suggests how such a scenario could come about in these United States.<br />The novel is well-written and fast-paced, never drags, and absolutely holds the reader's interest throughout.  The amazing thing about the story is that every bit of it hangs together without straining the reader's sense of credulity.  The novel features excellent writing, and the authors weave the plot together towards a conclusion that is startling and believable (no spoiler here).<br />This was a big budget movie in the 1960s featuring Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster (available on DVD) and I would very much like to see a reprint of the novel become available, as my often-read paperback copy has long since fallen to pieces from frequent readings.	2004-02-07

This is a truly wonderful science fiction novel that will hold the reader's interest from the very first page.  And I mean any reader, whether it be a young person just breaking in on reading science fiction novels, or a seasoned adult.  This book has something to offer everyone!  This is one of the most colorful science fiction tales ever to come down the pike, with vivid characterizations, an incredibly imaginative view of the far future, and the works.  It is somewhat like &quot;Star Wars&quot; only much more imaginative and more lighthearted.<br />This is the story of one Captain Pausert, a merchant spaceship skipper who is somewhat of a ne'er do well, although he is a fundamentally good-hearted man with a knack for getting into trouble.  And trouble is what he finds when he runs into the unforgettable &quot;Witches of Karres!&quot;  More would be telling, but I promise you, this is a great little story that the reader will never forget. This story is loaded with twists and turns, and is a hilarious and joyous look at the far future, when humankind has spread out across the galaxy along with many alien races, and humans themselves have diverged into very different types of people.<br />I first read this book when I was in high school, and I still pick it up and re-read it every five or ten years.  This is a memorable story, and unfortunately the author never wrote anything else half as good, meaning no disrespect.<br />There is absolutely no better book than this one to introduce to young readers.  Older readers will not be able to put it down either.  Some books are like that, and this is one.  Although the book never takes itself too seriously, this is an engaging story that in my opinion any reader will appreciate.	2004-01-25

C.S. Forester, grand master of the naval adventure novel, here writes not a novel, but simply a story, of young America's struggle to gain freedom of the seas against a harsh and cruel enemy that was seizing American ships and enslaving American sailors.  The rest of the world had put up with this state of affairs literally for centuries.  America, armed with resolve but no money, and virtually no navy, determined to end it.<br />Forester does not gloss over the difficulties and the folly that America committed along the way as it tried to figure out how to end the menace of the Barbary Pirates.  We tried to buy them off, but they couldn't be bought off, and these efforts endgendered contempt and even more depredations against American ships and men.  American politicians, even the great Jefferson, feared establishing a powerful Navy on the theory that such a Navy might become a threat to the young Republic's liberty by bringing forth tyrants.  This quaint theory would cause young America endless problems, both with the war against the pirates, and later in the War of 1812 against Britain.<br />Forester writes in a crisp narrative that completely holds the reader's interest, and he tells a complicated story in a manner that gets his point across without burying the reader in detail.  This is a short, sharp book that tells a great story from the early history of America and which holds lessons that are relevant to today's events and problems.<br />As Forester notes, every country at some time or another in its history brings forth an unusually large number of particularly gifted and great men.  This was such a time for America, which brought forth Preble and Decatur, naval heros who lived to become legends in their own times, and whose leadership brought honor to the American nation and Navy as it finally crushed the pirates, establishing the doctrine of Freedom of the Seas which even today is a bedrock of American policy.f the Seas which even today is a bedrock of American policy.	2004-01-20
US	46160224	R2IBOD553CQPSF	0399131493	34724671	Red Storm Rising	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Superb speculation about WW3 with the Soviets!	This is probably the best novel ever written that speculates about what a conventional war between NATO and the old Soviet Union would have been like, circa 1985 or so.  Of course, when the book was written the Soviet Union still existed, and the possibility of such a war was all too real.  Despite the changes in the world since that time, this novel is still highly entertaining and interesting, if perhaps somewhat less relevant.<br />Without putting out any spoilers, the plot of the novel is straightforward.  The Soviet Union suffers a catastrophic failure of its internal fuel/oil supplies, which its leaders learn will soon bring the Soviet economy to its knees.  Rather than deciding to deal with this setback through trade and negotiations, the Soviet leadership, dominated by hard-liners, decides to seize the Middle East oil fields immediately following a blitzkrieg campaign against NATO (to distract NATO from intervening in the Middle East).  Therein lies the story.<br />Clancy does an excellent job showing us a scenario of rising tension and the preparations by the Soviets for the surprise attack.  His speculations as regards Soviet strategy, while imaginative, are very reasonable and plausible.  In fact, supposedly the strategy in this scenario was \\"war-gamed\\" with the superb strategy game \\"Harpoon.\\"<br />Like most Clancy novels, the character development here takes a backseat to the military-political story he is trying to tell, but the novel is fine for all that, and there are in fact some interesting characters in this book.  Overall, this book is an interesting and satisfying read, moves along at a brisk pace, and always holds the reader's interest.  Without giving anything away, I thought that the ending was very representative of prevailing thought and attitudes prior to the end of the Cold War.<br />By the way, this is one of the few true Clancy novels that is not a \\"Jack Ryan\\" novel.  This is not part of the Jack Ryan \\"universe\\" and Ryan is nowhere to be found in this novel.<br />As always, Clancy's depiction and understanding of NATO and Soviet military hardware, strategy, and tactics, is the strength of this book.  Even today, this is one to read, and most readers will enjoy reading this one more than once.found in this novel.<br />As always, Clancy's depiction and understanding of NATO and Soviet military hardware, strategy, and tactics, is the strength of this book.

This is a superb novel of the early Civil War.  Jeff Shaara uses the same format that his father used in the great novel \\"The Killer Angels\\" (the story of the Battle of Gettysburg) to tell the story of the early Civil War days.  Shaara's novel shows us the war as seen through the eyes of Winfield S. Hancock, Joshua Chamberlain, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson.  The format works.  This is a tremendously entertaining novel and fabulously educational to boot.  I truly felt after reading the novel that I understood what it was like in those early frenetic days, as the country and the US Army split, with people choosing sides, North and South, for the coming conflict.  What an incredible and sad time that must have been!<br />The novel is less pro-Southern than the movie \\"Gods and Generals\\" and unlike the movie, the novel does not drag, and the storyline moves along briskly, holding the reader's interest at all times.  I felt that Shaara presented a balanced view of the two sides.  The South was motivated by a love of, and loyalty to, home and hearth much more that it was motivated by slavery, although I personally believe that slavery was beyond any doubt the root cause of the war.  (This does not mean that slavery is what motivated the people of the South to fight.)  The North, of course, was fighting to preserve the American union as one indivisible nation as Northerners believed that the Founding Fathers intended for it to be.  These were great and stirring causes, which Shaara brings out beautifully, and it took a great war to resolve their inconsistencies.  This book goes far in explaining and telling how it must have been to be a soldier or politician in that pivotal time.<br />\\"Gods and Generals\\" is a worthy prequel to the bestselling \\"The Killer Angels\\" and any Civil War buff will want to read it several times.  This is a deep and detailed book and in my opinion to fully appreciate it most readers will probably read it more than once.  I did, and it was time well spent.e well spent.	2004-01-17

Great!	&quot;Plum Island&quot; is probably my favorite detective novel of all time.  No surprise here: DeMille is my favorite author, and in Plum Island he does not let us down.  DeMille has two general modes for his writing: deadly serious (e.g. &quot;The Charm School&quot;; &quot;Word of Honor&quot;) and somewhat humorous (e.g. &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; &quot;The Gold Coast&quot;).  Plum Island falls into the latter catagory, which is not to say that it does not have its serious moments.  I am saying that it is absolutely hilarious at times, even if it is a murder mystery.<br />The plot is simple enough (no spoilers here).  Detective John Corey is recovering from a gunshot wound in a rustic part of Long Island.  Two of his friends are murdered, and the local law enforcement officer asks for Corey's help.  The two victims worked at a top-secret Federal germ warfare facility, so things quickly get very complicated.  More would be telling, but I guarantee that the ending is unpredictable and does not disappoint.<br />The story moves along at a brisk but not hurried pace, never drags, and hold the reader's interest absolutely.  John Corey is one of those unforgettable characters that only very talented authors (like DeMille) are capable of creating.  DeMille's marvelous sense of humor is never far away despite this being a murder mystery, and this lightens things up without trivializing it.  DeMille's prose is peerless, and it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this novel.<br />Plum Island deserves every one of the five stars I gave it.  Read it and I imagine that you will agree with me!	2004-01-15

Oates views Lincoln as a genuinely good man, highly ambitious, self-made, and first and foremost: a politician.  Like all politicians who are heads of state, Lincoln had to grapple with the issues of his day.  In his day, however, the issues were unusually intractable, difficult, and complex, such that the nation was unable to solve them through established institutions.  It took an actual Civil War to decide whether slavery in America must go, whether America is first and foremost a union of united States, or whether it was a Union of essentially sovereign single states.  These were and are great issues, and the greatness of Lincoln is that he stood in the center of these issues, spent his entire presidency grappling with them, and ultimately, it was his unswerving leadership, not perfect but great, that ultimately led America to resolution of these issues.<br />Oates shows us that Lincoln was a politician.  He wheedled, compromised, and was carried by great events as often as he shaped them.  This does nothing to take away from the man who, along with Washington, ranks as doubtless one of our two greatest presidents. While opposing slavery, Lincoln was ready to compromise with it, at least sometimes to some extent.  Oates does a good job of explaining this in a non-revisionist way that shows respect to Lincoln and to history.<br />Oates' writing is clear, and his research thorough.  This is not a perfect book in that it is not a complete view of Lincoln.  No 400 or so page book about this complicated man could achieve that.  On the other hand, Oates portrays Lincoln brilliantly, and with insight, as a gifted leader and politician in an incredibly difficult time.<br />I would have enjoyed more discussion of some of Lincoln's more extreme actions, his bending (some would say breaking) of the Constitution, and the extremes to which he went to achieve ultimate military victory for the North.  Oates does touch on this, but more would have been welcome.<br />An excellent book about a difficult and complex subject.  Recommended.nt to achieve ultimate military victory for the North.

Kennedy and his family as of late, the most notable of which is the aptly titled \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" by Seymore Hersh.  \\"The Kennedys at War\\" by Edward J. Renehan is a less hostile and somewhat more balanced look at the young JFK.  Overall, Renehan paints a flattering picture of the young John Kennedy, an ambivalent one towards John's older brother, Joe Jr., and a downright negative picture of Joe Kennedy Senior.  Their sister Kathleen is mentioned, but this book does not really do much to help the reader to know her.<br />Renehan's theme as regards the young JFK is that he was in constant pain as the result of a plethora of ailments, including his chronically bad back, his Addison's disease, and a urinary condition brought about by (probably multiple cases of) Venerial Disease.  Despite these ailments, JFK rose above them to finish college with reasonable success, write a best-selling book just prior to World War II, and serve with distinction in the Navy in the Pacific War.  Renehan essentially points out that many people suffering from JFK's multitude of painful ailments might have opted for the easy life.  John Kennedy did no such thing.<br />Overall, Renehan presents JFK as a determined and socially-adept young man with genuine intellectual gifts, who declines a life of ease as the son of one of the country's richest men and instead opts for a life of achievement and public service.  Renehan disputes the widespread belief that JFK's book \\"Why England Slept\\" which became a bestseller, was ghostwritten for him, and the widespread notion that the book became a bestseller only because Joe Senior bought truckloads of copies.  According to Renehan, earlier drafts plainly show that the revisions were largely those of John Kennedy himself, and no bogus purchases were needed because the book received critical acclaim and sold out quickly from bookstores.  Renehan does not whitewash the \\"PT-109\\" incident and certain lapses on Kennedy's part, but does point out that it is undisputed that the men were rescued in large part due to Kennedy's excellent leadership.  I felt that he gave us a balanced look at this famous story.<br />Overall, the young JFK comes across as a not-perfect but nonetheless genuinely outstanding man.  Renehan does not ignore JFK's womanizing, which certainly took place during the period covered by this book.  But neither does he dwell on it overlong.  The reader can decide for him or her self whether Renehan strikes the right balance here.  I thought he did.<br />Joe Kennedy Senior fares much worse in the book.  Renehan rightly portrays Joe Senior's tenure as America's ambassador to Britain as having been a disaster for both the country and for Joe himself.  Preaching appeasement to Hitler, and frequently expressing the belief that both Britain and America were destined to become Fascist states themselves \\"Democracy is dead in Britain...\\" according to Renehan the main reason Roosevelt appointed Joe Senior as ambassador to Britain was to get him out of the country at a critical time for the Roosevelt Administration.  Renehan makes a persuasive case, and certainly Joe Senior's many errors in this context were adequately chronicled at the time.  Overall an incredibly negative picture of the man.<br />Joe Kennedy Junior, JFK's older brother, never really comes out in this book.  Renehan paints him as essentially a good-looking fellow who was nonetheless a bully and not particularly gifted with interpersonal skills.  I frankly did not feel that Renehan did much to help me understand Joe Junior.  The same with Kathleen Kennedy.<br />I am not terribly interested in the Kennedy family, whose day has plainly passed.

This is an excellent book about the life of Henry Hill, a petty mobster in New York State.  This book, of course, is the basis for the superb movie &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;<br />While The Godfather is a fictional account of the underworld's upper realm, Henry Hill was a part of the lower echelon of the Mafia.  The people that run protection rackets, hold-ups, grand thefts, etc. and then pay tribute to the &quot;made&quot; members of the Mafia, who are mainly pure-blooded Sicilians and who form an elite that people like Henry Hill could do business with, but never quite be part of.<br />The book is extremely interesting because of the picture it shows us of organized crime &quot;where the rubber hits the road.&quot;  The most astounding thing I took away from the book is that Hill and his confederates didn't really benefit all that much from their ill-gotten gains.  Instead, they tended to literally throw their money away on a silly, lavish, extravagant lifestyle, featuring, for example $100 tips to doormen, big bribes to get the best tables at restaurants, etc.  Hill explained that he saw no need to save because he could always generate all the earnings he needed.  Wrong!<br />Most of us are unaware that organized crime is such a large presence in society, costing all of us immense amounts of money.  This book drives that point home and it is a shocking revelation.<br />The other insight of the book, which also comes out brilliantly in the film, is that Hill and his fellow mobsters viewed themselves as far above ordinary schmucks who actually work for a living.  After all, why work if you can spend a few hours a day playing the rackets making ten times as much?  But after reading the book, the wantoness, pointlessness, and gruesome violence of the underworld is readily apparent, and it is clear that Hill and his associates were ultimately undone by their corrupt lives.  The story is one of initial prosperity followed by a descent into corruption, mindless brutality, and ultimately betrayal and prison.<br />I give the book four stars, mainly for its content and insight.  I didn't find the writing to be much better than average, but the subject matter is outstanding, so four stars.  That ain't bad.and ultimately betrayal and prison.<br />I give the book four stars, mainly for its content and insight.

This is an extraordinarily good read by master author Mario Puzo.  It is the story of the fictional Clericuzio Family--the last great Mafia family in the United States.  The Clericuzios at the height of the powers are dominant in gambling, drugs, and other related rackets.  But the family patriarch, Don Clericuzio, sees organized crime for the dead end that it is, and devises a plan for his progeny to eventually transition to, and enter into the &quot;legitimate world.&quot;  But his plan envisions this transition to occur on his own terms, so that when the Family indeed abandons crime, it will do so from a position of strength, entering the ordinary world with wealth and prestige.<br />There are problems.  Some members of the family are less than enthusiastic about abandoning the underworld, and this is the nexus of the story.  Nephew Cross De Lena and Grandson Dante Clericuzio fight what amounts to a secret civil war within the Family, even as the legacy of earlier terrible deeds by the great Don himself finally come home to roost.  This is an entertaining and insightful story, well-written.  It is equally good with beer and chips, or for a more introspective reader.<br />The book is not without faults.  As an attorney, I can only say that Puzo's depiction of &quot;California juries&quot; as regards the insanity defense, is simply asinine, and shows either a contempt for the way things really are, or a simple disregard for facts in order to entertain.  OK, I guess, authors are entitled to take liberties with the truth in order to entertain us, I just thought that this particular liberty was unnecessary, since the book seems authentic in so many other ways.  Whatever.<br />The novel's treatment of Hollywood is hilarious.  Basically, Puzo depicts the struggles of competing studios, actors, and actresses in the entertainment world as essentially a legalized mob conflict, without the guns.  I don't know much about Hollywood, so I have no comment about this except to say that here Puzo was pretty entertaining.<br />Overall, this was an outstanding book that makes for an excellent read.ay that here Puzo was pretty entertaining.<br />Overall, this was an outstanding book that makes for an excellent read.	2004-01-05

The Godfather is one of the great novels of the twentieth century and constitutes the defining story of organized crime in America.  Oh, other novels have and will be written on this subject, some of them very good indeed.  But The Godfather stands alone, far above all others of the genre.  This is a classic and great novel.  Seven stars at least.<br />This is the story of Don Vito Corleone, whose Sicilian father (family name of Andolini) is murdered by the local Mafia Don in Corleone, Sicily.  Relatives spirit young Vito away to America, for otherwise he too will be murdered to prevent the otherwise certain day when he will come for revenge.  Vito comes to America and builds an empire of organized crime.<br />The triumph of this novel is that it explains the Mafia as the Mafia sees itself.  As Vito's son Michael explains, Vito (known to friends and associates as The Godfather, a traditional term of respect) sees himself as the equal of presidents, senators, and governors of the states, and sees no reason to be &quot;a fool&quot; or to accept the rules of society that condemn others to (what he perceives as) lives of failure and subordination.  Accordingly, Don Corleone rejects the rules of society, the fact that governments restrict the use of violence to themselves, and builds his own society--La Cosa Nostra (&quot;our world&quot;).  Within the narrow limits of this world he is more powerful than the government.<br />The book can be criticized for somewhat glorifying the underworld, but in reality by the time the reader completes the novel the corruption, violence, and destructiveness of organized crime are depressingly obvious.<br />The other amazing thing about this novel is Puzo's ability to tell an extraordinarily complex story involving many characters in a coherent fashion that never loses the reader with too much detail.  By the time I finished the novel I felt that I knew Tom Hagan, Michael and Sonny Corleone, the Don himself, Johnnie Fontane, and a whole host of other characters.  Most novels founder in confusion when they try to present so many characters and so many interconnected sub-plots.  Not here.  Puzo tells his story with superb prose and flawless coherence.  From a craftsmanship standpoint, this is precisely the type of novel that all novelists aspire to write.  Few succeed.  Puzo succeeds brilliantly.<br />Before reading this novel I had never understood the role of the Mafia in American (or Sicilian!) society, and how complicity by the authorities is what really allow it to function.

This is the story of an American sea captain in charge of bringing a convoy of ships from America to Britain during the early days of America's entry into the Second World War.  Confronted by a frightfully competent adversary--the German U-Boat fleet, Captain Krause has a vital mission indeed, as Britain's survival was dependent upon such convoys.  Krause is well aware that the outcome of the war at that time was very much in doubt, and he must bring to bear all of the skills he has learned in a career forged largely in peacetime.<br />Krause is more than a little reminiscent of Hornblower--highly intelligent, introspective, and full of self-doubts.  Forester masterfully shows how Krause must continuously make tough decisions based upon imperfect knowledge, often low-quality ships and equipment, and subordinates who often execute his orders imperfectly.  He must take all of these factors into account, and how he manages to do this makes for a very fine and satisfying tale.<br />Personally, I could have done without Krause's flashbacks to his early marital troubles.  I just didn't think this added anything either to the reader's understanding of Krause and his character, or to the story in general.  Just my opinion.  The career problems that Krause had earlier faced added a sufficient melancholy ingredient to the story, without being sordid.<br />Forester always succeeds when he sets out to write a novel of naval adventure, and this book is no exception.  This is a wonderful novel.  I debated whether to deprive it of the fifth star because I believe that the Hornblower series, and &quot;The Captain From Connecticut&quot; are even better than this novel.  But in reality this book is among the very best tales of naval adventure even if Forester has written even better ones, and so five stars it will be.	2004-01-04

This is a fine novel by CS Forester, the author of the magnificent Hornblower series of novels.  It tells the story of a fictional American naval sea captain during the War of 1812, one Captain Josiah Peabody--an American charged with the mission of breaking the British blocade of the fledgling United States and wreaking havoc with the British sea lanes.  This, he understands, will give America leverage against Britain and perhaps help motivate it to make peace.<br />As Forester explains, America had failed to prepare adequately for the possibility of war, had not built up much of a Navy, and paid a thousandfold for this folly.  Although Peabody is a fictional character, real life American captains like him did exist, and in fact the American Navy won glory against England in the War of 1812 in numerous ship actions that pitted a plucky but weak United States against the world's most powerful sea power.<br />The story is very well-told, and Forester's insightful portrayal of Captain Peabody is a fine examination of the American character as it is often perceived by Britons.  As always, Forester spins a great sea yarn, with all of the technical details perfect (I'm taking other people's word for this, but I know it is true!) and you can practically smell the salt water and hear the waves.<br />An enjoyable yarn that ranks with the very best stories of naval adventure.	2004-01-04

This is the third Hornblower novel by way of continuity, following &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and &quot;Lieutenent Hornblower&quot; and it is one of the very best Hornblower novels.  Horatio Hornblower has been promoted to Commander, and is now captain (not a Post-Captain) of HMS Sloop Hotspur, which is given the important duty of monitoring the French port of Brest.  Captain Hornblower and First Lieutenant Bush are now fully developed as characters, and their long association together takes form in this novel.  Here, Hornblower is now gaining a reputation as an unusually competent and resourceful officer, as the storied Admiral Cornwallis takes Hornblower under his wing as mentor.  Nonetheless, this is a time of great stress and danger for Hornblower. The British Navy is exerting every ounce of Britain's strength against Napoleon, and the British fleet is all that stands between the Corsican tyrant and world domination.  Hotspur, commanded by Hornblower, is responsible for monitoring Brest, which is where Napoleon's next move against Britain is expected to first come from.  Hornblower is truly &quot;the tip of the spear.&quot;  This is a great story.<br />&quot;Hotspur&quot; is one of the key Hornblower novels and I highly recommend it to Hornblower afficianados and anyone who just likes a good novel of the days of &quot;wooden ships and iron men.&quot;  By the way, it makes for a nice sequence of reading if you follow &quot;Hotspur&quot; with &quot;Hornblower During the Crisis.&quot;  You'll see why when you read the latter.<br />The Hornblower novels are in my opinion the best naval adventure series in all of literature and &quot;Hotspur&quot; is one of the very best of the series.  What more can one say?	2004-01-03

In all of the Hornblower books prior to &quot;Flying Colours&quot; Hornblower is a hard luck Captain.  Although he generally succeeds in his missions, he does so despite hard luck and bad breaks, by the sheer virtue of his intelligence and determination.  Prize money has eluded him for years, he marries poorly, and he is not of high birth.  The first several Hornblower novels are the tale of an officer who succeeds in spite of a long run of bad luck and hard circumstances in a merciless and unforgiving service.<br />In Flying Colors, this all changes, and Hornblower manages to finally capitalize on his achievements and success.  This is a satisfying story of a brilliant man overcoming hardship and finally getting the rewards and fame that are justly his.  While this novel is not quite in the class of &quot;Beat to Quarters,&quot; &quot;Ship of the Line,&quot; &quot;Hotspur&quot; and several other of the Hornblower novels, it is nevertheless a well-written and satisfying tale.  In this novel, Hornblower's life finally comes together, and even in the class-ridden British Navy, competence finally shines through and our hero gets the rewards due him.<br />This is a fine novel that anyone will enjoy, and Hornblower afficianados must not miss.	2004-01-03

This book is the story of a Confederate lower-ranking soldier's wartime experiences during the Civil War.  Watkins wrote this a considerable time after the war, and he admits that some of his memories may have faded, some of his facts may be wrong, because after all, what he is really serving up is a private's perspective of great events, which tend to focus on remarkably different issues than a general or a historian might relate--often a worm's eye view of things.<br />In reality, Watkins is too modest, because this book is a sensitive, gritty, honest, and insightful look at the experiences of a Confederate soldier who participated in some of the heaviest fighting of the Civil War, or indeed American history.  Without saying so, we learn that Watkins and his fellow Confederates were not fighting to preserve slavery and very few of them could have cared less about the issue.  While this was undoubtedly the underlying cause of the Civil War (the slavery issue) the Confederate rank and file did not see it that way--they were fighting for what they believed was their right of self-government--\\"Southern Rights.\\"  And in the end, they believed they were fighting for their homes.  This comes shining through Watkins' memoirs.<br />Watkins' writing features a whimsical humor combined with a gritty authenticity that in my opinion gives a truly valuable insight into the daily life and wartime experiences of a real fighting man.  We've all read about the high casualty rates in the Civil War infantry.  Watkins lived with this fact, and his various accounts of men fighting and dying to his right and left, day after day, indeed year after year, drive home the fact that this was a deadly struggle, and a catastrophe for those caught up in it.  Watkins' matter-of-fact descriptions of his battles, his encounters with many other aspects of the war (the horrible situations in some of the hospitals, for example), and many other things make this book not only a pleasure to read, but a valuable contribution to history.<br />Ken Burns' \\"The Civil War\\" drew heavily on Watkins' book, and rightly so.  Watkins' memoirs provide wonderful insight not only about what the war was like, but also what the Confederate soldier was like.aluable contribution to history.<br />Ken Burns' \\"The Civil War\\" drew heavily on Watkins' book, and rightly so.

Although some of the weapons issues that the book discusses are now dated (the book features a pretty good discussion of the missile-versus-bomber issue that was very real in the late '50s but which is now passe) in my opinion this detracts not at all from the novel's relevance.  This is a gritty, hard-hitting novel about what life might have been like had mankind not managed to avoid nuclear conflict during the bad old days of the Cold War.  Nuclear weapons are still around in abundance, and this book is still worth reading, and it is an enjoyable read that I personally found impossible to put down.<br />The story is set in a small Florda town that manages to be outside any of the blast or target zones.  The novel begins prior to the outbreak of nuclear conflict, and takes us through it to its aftermath--an aftermath of anarchy, hardship, and economic chaos, as the agricultural and economic back of the country are broken, and perhaps a majority of Americans are dead, in common with people in many parts of the world.  This could have happened and still could.  This stark fact is what makes this novel as relevant today as it ever was, despite some of the dated military-political issues that it occasionally discusses.<br />The book does show the citizens of this small town surviving with dignity and even some optimism.  But it never lets us forget that a nuclear war would be a catastrophe for mankind.  Although we have dodged this bullet so far, surely current events show that we cannot be complacent, and books like this are as important as ever.<br />A good novel that I recommend to everyone.	2004-01-01

The author explains that &quot;mankind had too long been rolling an endless succession of sevens&quot; and that like all animals that had multiplied out of turn, the sudden catastrophe was inevitable to set the balance back to what nature intended.  This novel tells the story of a very small group of survivors, and suggests what life would be like under in the aftermath, and perhaps, more profoundly, what such a scenario might mean for mankind.<br />The author's premise is that little or nothing of civilization would survive such an event.  In the story **very minor spoiler** although the survivors make attempts at preserving the skills and lessons of civilization, this eventually becomes impossible against the tide of events sweeping mankind back not just to barbarism (in which some skills and beliefs might have survived) but to downright savagery and superstition.  The most profound thought that the author successfully imparts is that all of the traditions, skills, and manifestations of our civilization could--and would--be lost in a single generation.  Unforgettable is when one of the characters in the story looks out at the ruins of the San Francisco Bay Bridge (before it too passes away) and asks--&quot;who built this.&quot;  The protagonist thinks for a second and answers: &quot;the Americans built it.&quot;  The next question is &quot;who were the Americans?&quot;  I have never forgotten this exchange, which I felt illustrated brilliantly how important it is for one generation to impart the best ideas of civilization to the next, and how easily all our achievements and successes might be lost in the face of a global catastrophe.<br />The reader need not and probably will not agree with all of the author's conclusions about what would happen in this scenario.  Would we really lose the skill of a written language?  Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age?  The author will challenge the reader's own thoughts on this subject, and that is fine.  One need not agree with all of the conclusions that the novel contains to enjoy this story.<br />Although written many years ago, upon re-reading this novel recently I found that it had lost little or none of its impact or relevance.  It features a bit more prudishness than a modern novel might contain, but in my opinion is none the worse for this.  The story is well-told, the prose is quite good, and the storyline moves along all the while capturing and retaining the reader's interest.  This is a novel that I would recommend to everyone.lly lose the skill of a written language?  Would we really fall all the way back almost to the Old Stone Age?

This is a fine novel by Jeff Shaara, the son of Michael Shaara, the author of &quot;The Killer Angels.&quot;  The novel deals with &quot;the end game&quot; of the Civil War, in which Ulysses Grant assumes supreme command of the US Army with the mission from President Lincoln of defeating the Confederate Army.  Jeff Shaara uses the same technique of examining the conflict from the perspectives of various characters that &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; employed with such effectiveness.  It works very well here, and Shaara tells a great story.  It is also good history, and this novel does a fine job of acquainting the reader with the events that took place in the Civil War's late phases.  Shaara does a good job of explaining what Grant's strengths (and occasional flaws) were as a military commander, and why this man played a pivotal role in finally bringing the war to a close.<br />In my opinion Shaara does an exceptional job in this novel of telling the story of the Civil War's &quot;End Game.&quot;  Grant takes over at a time when the Army of the Potomac should have been riding high in the aftermath of Meade's great victory at Gettysburg.  But it was not, and that great army still suffered from many of the problems that had caused final victory to elude it for years, despite numbers, and despite the fact that it was the best-organized and best equipped army the world had ever seen.  Unforgettable is the scene in the novel where President Lincoln and General Grant are overseeing the unprecedented logistical support being lavished on the Army--Grant points out that if only one certain man--Robert E. Lee-- could see this panorama, the futility of continuing the war would be obvious to him.  Unfortunately, Lee leads the Army of Northern Virginia to fight almost to the bitter end; a lesson to foreigners who think that Americans will only fight when the odds favor them.  Lee's soldiers were living on grass and acorns by the time Lee finally accepted defeat.<br />This is a novel that almost all readers will enjoy as well as appreciate for its historical insights.novel that almost all readers will enjoy as well as appreciate for its historical insights.	2003-12-30

First, the disclaimer: although I am a conservative, I like and admire much of what JFK did as president, and I admire the man.  Few readers will begin reading this book without a pre-existing opinion of Kennedy.  That is/was mine.<br /><br />Hersh does a workmanlike job illustrating the apparently undeniable fact that Kennedy had medical problems, integrity issues, and personal problems that the country would probably not tolerate in a president today.  This book appears to be well-researched and well-documented.  It does not present a flattering portrayal of Kennedy and it does not intend to.<br /><br />First, the infidelity.  Hersh goes into depressing detail as to his theme that JFK's marriage was a sham.  According to Hersh, JFK never missed an opportunity to philander whenever Jackie Kennedy was away, and sometimes when she wasn't away.  Much of JFK's inner circle conspired with him in this regards (according to Hersh) to a degree that is hard to imagine.  Hersh speculates that part of Kennedy's abnormal libedo was induced by various drugs he took for his Addison's condition.  Hersh develops this theme further in his discussion of the Cuban Missile Crisis and speculates that the cocktail of steroids and other drugs that Kennedy evidently needed to get through the day affected his judgment and his willingness to take risks.  This in turn may have caused him to be more prone to the kind of brinksmanship that Hersh claims characterized Kennedy's handling of the Missile Crisis.<br /><br />Personally I'm not so sure.  Despite the fact that the US had an overwhelming nuclear and overall military superiority over Soviets in 1962, Kennedy did not bomb the missiles out but instead negotiated.  Here I felt Hersh was unfair to Kennedy.  The record seems clear that Kennedy was acutely aware that the world was on the brink of a nuclear confrontation and he was determined to avoid a holocaust while forcing the removal of the missiles.  These things he did, to his very great credit.  Compare Kennedy's competence with the kind of feckless European diplomacy that led the world into two World Wars.  Americans can be proud of Kennedy's handling of this crisis and I disagree with Hersh in this context.<br /><br />On the other hand, it seems clear that Kennedy's marriage was a sham and his image of youthful vigor was even more of a sham.  Hersh is convincing that Kennedy could not get through the day without a battery of probably illegal and unhealthy drugs.  Kennedy was suffering from Addison's disease, which is a very serious condition, and the man had many other health issues, including the famous back problem, which put him in constant pain.<br /><br />Personally I found this book convincing as regards the infidelity, drug, and health claims that it made about Kennedy.  Hersh is on thinner ice when he theorizes that these issues caused Kennedy to endanger the country.  While this book or one like it is probably needed to balance the fluff pieces about Kennedy (and all the Kennedys) that abound, it is not itself a balanced analysis of JFK.

I myself have read the novel many times over the past twenty years.  The novel focuses on two families--the Hazards of Pennsylvania, and the Mains of South Carolina--during the period from approximately 1840 through the beginning of the Civil War.  These two families, bound by close ties of friendship (the sons of each are best friends at West Point and serve in the Army together during the Mexican War) and marriage, find these ties tested by the powerful forces of political and social strife that rocked the country during this period, ultimately leading to civil war.<br />This is a great story.  Author John Jakes does a tremendous job of transporting the reader into the period immediately before the Civil War.  The country was torn by political strife that could not be resolved by the ordinary institutions of civil government, and Jakes does a masterful job of explaining this within the format of a novel, and showing how this atmosphere affected ordinary people, and their friendships and relationships.  The Hazards and the Mains are unforgettable.  Jakes shows how decent people (as well as people not so decent) interacted with the institution of slavery on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.<br />One of the best parts of the novel deals with the period during the 1840s when the two main protagonists are classmates together at West Point.  This is a well-researched tale that is very insightful as regards life and strife at the military academy during a pivotal period of American history.  It helps the reader understand the important role that West Point played in the nation's history during the Mexican War and, of course, the Civil War.  And perhaps today.<br />This novel rates the overused label of \\"classic\\" and in my opinion represents one of the very best novels of the Civil War.

Elisha Hunt Rhodes enlisted in the Army of the Potomac and fought in almost every major eastern Civil War engagement.  This book is a compilation of his private diary and papers written at the time of these events.  The book is one of the most insightful and honest glimpses into the life, hardships, motivations, and opinions of a young soldier that the reader is ever likely to find.  Rhodes writes with clarity and candor; if you want to know what it was like to be a Union Civil War soldier, there is perhaps no better book.<br />The PBS Documentary \\"The Civil War\\" drew heavily on Rhodes' book.  By the way, one of the things I really liked about the book is that it included some contemporary photographs of people that served with Rhodes in his regiment.  Being able to match faces with his narrative was delightful.<br />What amazing times Rhodes lived through!  As soon as he enlisted, he was sent to the Capitol to help guard it.  On the way his regiment was booed and reviled by pro-Rebel citizens in parts of Maryland.  Rhodes lived through battlefield defeats and victories--the reader can fully appreciate the signficance to a young soldier like Rhodes when the great Union victory at Gettysburg takes place.  After all, there had been many Union defeats preceding it.<br />Rhodes comes through as a good and honest man, very intelligent, but in the beginning somewhat naive as twenty year olds are apt to be.  This is an outstanding glimpse into the mind of one of the soldiers who helped to save and preserve the Union.  After reading it, one can see that America was fortunate to possess thousands of Elisha Hunt Rhodes because that is what it took to win the war.  As the South had many equally good men, equally motivated, the reader can understand why it was a hard and long war.	2003-09-22

This is a splendid analysis of a pivotal battle of the early Civil War, in which two great and relatively green armies have at one another in a battle which contains the bloodiest single day in American military history.  Sears does a fine job of explaining to the reader why this battle had vast strategic as well as military significance.  Britain and France were on the verge of intervening on the Confederate side, because their textile industries were screaming for cotton (Southern cotton was blockaded by the Union Navy) and accordingly their textile workers were screaming for jobs. (This is language that politicians understood well, then as now.)  President Lincoln thoroughly understood the dynamics of this risk, realized that once these foreign powers intervened that the Union cause was almost certainly lost.  He prepared the Emancipation Proclamation, which Sears shows to have been a political masterstroke.  It made it politically impossible for any Great Power to support the South and slavery against the Union and abolition.<br />But there was a problem before the battle occurred, and Lincoln knew this too: the Union Army in the east had suffered a continuous series of defeats.  To announce the proclamation abolishing slavery without a victory to herald it would be a terrible sign of weakness; one that might only encourage intervention.  Lincoln needed a victory in the east first.  When Lee's army crossed into Maryland, the President knew he had his chance for the victory he needed.  And therein lies a fascinating story which Sears presents crisply and with unusual clarity.<br />Sears has a gift for explaining a lot of details of a battle without completely losing the reader, as so often happens in this type of book.  He wonderfully and colorfully describes the Southern march into Maryland and its skeptical reception by the Marylanders, who find their towns and hamlets occupied by a foreign army which is nevertheless comprised of fellow Americans.  It is hard to imagine such a thing today, as indeed it was hard for people to imagine back then.  But these people lived through it, and Sears makes the reader almost feel a part of it.<br />Sears paints one of the most negative pictures of General McClellan I can ever remember reading, but he is persuasive.  I at least felt that Sears was no harsher on McClellan than the facts warrant.  He also explains why Lincoln, who by then saw McClellan for what he was, nevertheless put up with him.<br />One aside: the book contains an excellent appendix concerning the lost order. (McClellan found himself in possession of Lee's precise written battle plans on the eve of battle through an inexplicable stroke of incredible luck.  In fact, only McClellan could have lost the battle after having such luck, and McClellan more or less admitted the same prior to the battle.)  I had always wanted to know more about this odd event, and Sears more or less tells what is known about it.<br />This is a very fine book.  Four and a half stars.

Rarely does a novel so thoroughly capture the story, people, and struggles surrounding a great event.  Shaara's characterizations of Joshua Chamberlain, James Longstreet, and other key figures of the Battle of Gettysburg are unforgettable.  Shaara's novel splendidly tells the story of two great armies, both motivated and fighting for what each believes is a great and just cause, as they come together to fight the biggest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere.  Shaara's telling of that portion of the battle which occurred on Little Round Top fully impresses upon the reader that this was one of the pivotal moments of history where quite possibly the Union Army and perhaps the entire Union cause turned on the heroism of a few men and the clear thinking of one man.  This is a great story.<br />This is a great novel of leadership, hardship, and history.  It does not demonize the Confederate side, but instead, without being pro-Southern, respectfully informs the reader that the key ingredient that made the Confederate Army one of the great armies of all time was the fact that to a man the Confederates truly believed in the justice of their cause; that they were fighting for their homes and hearths, or as they put it, \\"for our rahts...\\"  For all this, the novel does not ignore the contradictions in the Confederate cause.  The Union cause is similarly respectfully presented, and Joshua Chamberlain's speech to the 2d Maine mutineers (no spoiler here) is a great summary of the Union cause.<br />This novel utterly succeeds at both entertaining the reader, which is after all the first task of any novel, as well as telling a great story from history.  The reader will come away from the novel with much greater insight as to how the Battle of Gettysburg was truly the pivotal battle of the American Civil War.  Shaara fully faults General Robert E. Lee's failure to learn the lessons of the earlier Confederate victory at Fredricksburg as the reason for the outcome of the Gettysburg battle, and his analysis is pursuasive and fascinating.<br />This novel was an instant classic when it was published and it will always, in my opinion, be THE classic novel of the Battle of Gettysburg.

Bruce Catton is the grandmaster of nonfiction books written for the general public about the Civil War as seen from the Union perspective.  &quot;Grant Takes Command&quot; is about exactly that--the period just before Grant is appointed as the third Lieutenant-General in the history of the U.S. through the end of the Civil War.  This is a fascinating tale, colorful and well-told.<br />Mr. Catton does a remarkable job explaining General Grant to the reader.  He does much to explain Grant's style of leadership, his relationship with others including President Lincoln and General Meade, and how the soldiers in his army (and those in the Confederate Army!) regarded Grant.  Catton also discusses Grant's issues as regards drinking, and largely concludes that Grant had conquered this enemy long before he took on the Confederates as the Union's top general.<br />To me, the most interesting aspect of the book is Catton's excellent analysis as to how Grant finally managed to seize the initiative from Robert E. Lee.  After Gettysburg, this was no doubt easier than it had been earlier in the Civil War, but nevertheless it must be remembered that no other Union general had ever really managed to do this prior to Grant, excepting perhaps General Meade at Gettysburg.  Incidentally, Catton is relatively complimentary towards Gen. Meade, and points out that so was General Grant.<br />I found the relationship between Grant and President Lincoln to be particularly insightful.  It may be summed up that Lincoln quickly began to have complete and implicit trust in Grant, and was frankly relieved to have some of the burden of the war shifted from his shoulders to Grant.  For his part, Grant was loyal and respectful of the President, and was the perfect American general insofar as he thoroughly respected and acknowledged the core American value of ultimate civilian control over the military.<br />One fascinating anecdote was Mr. Catton's relating of an incident at the Battle of Two Harbors, where Grant proposed to General Lee after the battle, that both sides agree to allow their respective medics onto the battlefield unmolested during a stipulated time, to save life and relieve the horrendous suffering of wounded and dying men lying between nomansland.  Grant was indifferent to gaining or losing face, and focused solely on quickly coming to an arrangement in order to get on with the business of relieving the agony of the wounded.  Lee, on the other hand, postured for over a day in an effort to make it appear as though Grant were the supplicant approaching Lee the victor.  Meanwhile most of the wounded got on with the business of dying, and many lives were perhaps needlessly lost.  Candidly, this did nothing to improve my opinion of General Lee, and Catton relates this incident without judgment or rhetoric, allowing the reader to draw his or her own conclusion.  He does so largely by quoting the actual letters exchanged by the two generals, so Catton's relating of the event should probably be regarded as uncontroversial.  My own conclusion was that my personal estimation of Grant was heightened.  I do not, in relating this event, mean to attack General Lee, who is certainly one of the most regarded generals in American history.  But it does say something about both men.<br />Catton has a clear style of writing, and he embellishes his narrative with colorful and relevant anecdotes about each battle and incident from the perspectives of generals, officers, and men alike.  This is a great book about a great man during great times.

This is an unusually readable account of the events shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, the battle itself, and the immediate aftermath.  I have read many accounts of the battle, but none measure up to this book in my opinion.  Mr. Sears writes with exceptional clarity.  He often injects his own opinions and analysis of events, but he does so in a way that first presents the known objective facts from which his opinions derive, thus allowing the reader to judge for him or her self whether we agree with Mr. Sears' analysis.  Mostly I did.  Sears' book is unusually thoughtful and insightful, and while his opinions are not entirely conventional, they are persuasive.  Even if you don't agree with all of his takes on the battle, it is great fun reading them.<br />Mr. Sears essentially believes that General Meade thoroughly out-generalled the vaunted Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.  In fact he shows persuasively that Lee was unusually detached during the decisive points in the battle.  Lee failed to lead and control his Corps commanders, allowing Ewell and A.P. Hill to dither, and Longstreet to fail in his assault on the Union center line.  Sears agrees that Longstreet's proposal to flank the Union Army and maneuver such that the Federals would have had to attack the Confederates, rather than the reverse as actually occurs, was probably the strategy Lee should have followed. Today, this seems to be the opinion of most military historians.  What did surprise me is that Sears is fairly sympathetic to Meade's failure to pursue and destroy the Rebels immediately following the battle.  His insights and arguments on this issue were one of my favorite parts of the book.<br />If you are looking for a non-fictional account of the Battle of Gettysburg that is as readable as Michael Shaara's fictional &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; (my favorite Gettysburg novel) this is the book for you.	2003-09-06

The Confederates could have then themselves selected the ground for the battle. As we all know, Lee chose to engage in a frontal attack at Gettysburg, in what was probably the critical error of the war. The Confederate Army was never the same again, and was reduced to largely reacting to the maneuvers of the Grant/Meade juggernaut in future campaigns, until the inevitable end came.<br /><br />But what if it had been different? What if Longstreet prevailed on Lee to do what henceforth Lee had always done: select the ground for the battle rather than allowing the Union Army to do so? I will not elaborate much because I do not want to include any spoilers in this review. This book explores this notion subtly, starting off with the Confederate and Union confrontation at Gettysburg on Day One of the battle precisely as it began, but slowly, subtly diverging from the historical facts of the battle in a terribly plausible \\"alternate history\\" version of the battle and the war. The characterizations are very believable and plausible; the key figures, Lee, Meade, Longstreet, Chamberlain, Armistead, Ewell, et al. behave in this novel very much as they might have behaved in real life had events unfolded in the manner that the novel portrays. The reader comes away with the impression that this is very much how it could have been. The alternative scenario that the authors present is in fact quite consistent with the string of Confederate victories, particularly Chancellorsville and Fredricksburg, that had up to that time characterized the war. The ending was unexpectedly dramatic and powerful. This is a fine novel.<br /><br />A minor quibble (no spoilers) which I include largely for fun. Despite the fact that the Confederate Army was undisputedly one of the great armies of all time, I have always felt that success was certain to elude Lee when he campaigned in the North -- the problem of supply was certain to become insurmountable as Lee had no railroads and the Southern government had nothing to send him anyway--much of his army was barefoot! This book addresses this issue, but I still maintain that the possibility of a successful Confederate northern offensive is farfetched. But who can say? At the time of the war itself, the string of Confederate victories against the larger and better-equipped Union Army was indeed against the odds.<br /><br />This is a very fine novel, well worth reading and any Civil War buff will want to include it in his or her library.

I am a lousy cook myself, but my wife is a great one, and this book helped both of us prepare dishes consistent with the Atkins regime.<br />The Atkins program has proven itself in our household.  I have come down from a 35 to a 31 waist in about 8 months, and I realized very significant and visible results during the first two months of being on the diet.  My wife has experienced similar results.  All of this occurred without that ghastly craving feeling that you get when you follow a low-calorie diet.  By observing Atkins a person can eat well, experience a wonderful sense of high energy, and regain control over one's diet and body.  This cookbook is a great resource in following the Atkins regime, since the one price of the Atkins concept is that you do have to pay attention to your carbohydrate intake.  This cookbook is valuable for the recipes it contains, and perhaps more to the point, it helps educate the reader as to what kinds of ingredients are consistent with a low-carbohydrate diet.  This had confused me when I first went on the diet and this cookbook was helpful in enabling me to understand what kinds of ingredients to use in recipes, and also what kinds of dishes are OK to order in restaurants.<br />The Atkins program is a lifetime program which enables a person to stay thin without suffering or deprivation.  The recipes in this book prove that Atkins is not all about eating bacon and other high fat foods.  In fact, this book proves that Atkins is a healthy and sensible program that one can follow for life.	2003-07-22

The Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester is simply the best naval adventure writing in all of literature.  The Hornblower series deals with the career of a fictional British naval officer, Horatio Hornblower, during the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain is engaged in a life-or-death struggle with Bonaparte.  The various novels and short stories which comprise the series essentially trace Hornblower's rise from humble midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet.<br />\\"Hornblower During the Crisis\\" is a group of short stories that Forester apparently wrote to fill gaps in Hornblower's life in between the major novels which make up the series.  While the novels are in chronological order, there are gaps between several of them.  This book completes the most important of these, and also has some interesting little snippets about Hornblower in his old age.<br />The most important story in \\"Crisis\\" deals with the period of time immediately after Hornblower is promoted from Commander to Captain (although not confirmed yet by the Admiralty) and he leaves the HMS Hotspur, which is too small of a command for a Captain.  I found this story to be a penetrating and interesting one, which highlights the importance of good luck, and the willingness to take advantage of it by taking risks.  As the story states, Hornblower realized, in dealing with high British political and military figures upon returning to England, that his whole life and career perhaps turned on a few remarks he made over the space of a few minutes.  Who among us has not had at least one such pivotal moment?<br />...  The other stories in the book are all interesting and worth reading.  The Hornblower afficianado should not pass this book up.  Newcomers to Hornblower will probably not want to \\"break in\\" with Crisis, although I think any reader will appreciate these well-written stories.	2003-07-01

Ben Bova has been around a long time, has written a lot of novels, and when he writes a novel it is bound to be a decent read.  That is what this book is: a decent read for those of us who enjoy \\"hard\\" science fiction.<br />Candidly, this book is not in the same league as Bova's \\"Mars\\" or even \\"Moonrise\\" or \\"Moonwar.\\"  Although the story takes place almost entirely aboard a space station orbiting Jupiter, one would never know it. They might as well have been at an Antarctic research station--few of the special issues that surely would exist in such an envirnonment ever come out. The book takes a crack at being imaginative by featuring some odd aliens: a genetically modified (more intelligent) gorilla, and whale-like intelligent Jovians.  It doesn't work.  The ape reminded me of my three year old son except with gorilla strength, and the Jovians act just like human beings.  Not at all compelling, convincing, or interesting.  Well, that's my opinion, anyway.<br />Nor did I find the politics of the novel to be particularly interesting.  In effect, the novel is set in a world where a caricature of the present American so-called \\"religious right\\" is in full control in both the future USA and other countries.  Just as you'd expect, these folks (the \\"New Morality\\") are narrow-minded characters who you would not want to have a beer with.  They are against science and progress because, well, they are narrow-minded characters.  OK, so we know that Bova doesn't like the \\"religious right.\\"  We find that out in the first ten or so pages, which essentially constitute a recital as to how awful the \\"New Morality\\" is.  The \\"New Morality\\" then basically drops out of the novel into the distant background, basically as a bunch of puritans who don't want the folks on the space station to explore Jupiter and find out that it contains life and maybe intelligent Jovians. They don't want people to know that there are intelligent aliens because, well, the New Morality is comprised of narrow minded characters.  Ho hum.<br />Basically, like all of Bova's books that I have ever read (most of them) Bova paints a depressing view of the future--one in which individual liberty is very limited, and anything resembling a Jeffersonian view of freedom is a thing of the past.  In virtually all of Bova's books he postulates a future in which the authorities can pretty do whatever they like to whomever they like, and generally this is pretty ugly.  That is certainly the case in this book--you'll find this recurrent theme throughout.  Just like in Bova's \\"Mars\\" \\"Moonrise\\" \\"Moonwar\\" and I imagine the others.<br />Bova's prose is good.  As usual, his character development is serviceable, but none of the characters are compelling, and all are quite forgettable.  Nevertheless, this is a readable book; good for an afternoon at the beach or whatnot.nded characters.

This is a great telling of a great story -- how the Wright brothers came to be the first human beings to accomplish powered, heavier-than-air flight. As this historical novel makes clear, they did it by being the first men to take a methodical, scientific look at what was required to accomplish not only flight, but controlled, competent powered flight. The Wrights were giants--they were years ahead of their rivals. This novel explains that the Wrights first had to originate, from scratch, all of the mathematics and engineering of how to build a true lifting wing. They then had to design, from scratch, a means to control the aircraft in flight by means of warping wing controls--essentially the same methods we use today. These were staggering achievements that the Wrights did not \\"luck into.\\" On top of these achievements, since there was no suitable gasoline motor to power the Wright Flyer, why, the Wrights simply designed a suitable engine, from scratch, which at the time was the only suitable engine for powered flight on the planet. In point of fact, between Wilbur Wright's methodical, mathematical approach, and Orville Wright's ingenius mechanical aptitude and intuitive grasp of the problem of flight, the Wrights represented a rare combination of scientific rigor and engineering finesse. They were a decade or more ahead of their competition. The best part of this novel is the manner in which it explains in layman's terms what the scientific-engineering problems were that mankind faced circa 1900 to accomplish heavier-than-air flight. The telling of how the Wrights solved these problems makes a great story.<br />The novel debunks a number of myths that sometimes persist today when the story of early manned flight is told. Professor Langely was not merely unlucky in his attempt to build his \\"Grand Aerodrome\\" (a US-government sponsored project to build the first airplane). In reality, like all of the Wright's competitors, he failed to grasp the fundamental problem of flight--the lifting wing and the need to control the aircraft in three dimensions. This is why each of his attempts promptly crashed into the ocean. Not until they frankly copied the Wright concepts and designs did the Wrights' competitors literally get off the ground.<br />The novel also provides a fascinating look at the business conflicts between the Wrights on the one hand, and their rivals on the others, as the Wrights sought to make an honest profit from their achievements. This is a wonderful story in its own right, told well.<br />The Wrights were, quite simply, giants. This novel does a fine job of impressing the reader with the magnitude of their achievements, while still showing us that the Wrights (and their colleagues and rivals) were human beings with the usual array of human failings.flight--the lifting wing and the need to control the aircraft in three dimensions.

It had a tremendous impact on me then.  I recently re-read it after a long hiatus, and I discovered that the novel has lost none of its punch.<br />In &quot;Warday&quot; the US and the old Soviet Union fight a limited atomic war.  Russia is more or less completely destroyed, but not before its atomic weapons wreak havoc on the United States, destroying New York City and many other locations.  The effects of the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) destroy virtually all of America's electronic infrastructure, right down to automobiles and toasters, and the nation's industrial and agricultural back is broken.<br />In the aftermath, America's &quot;allies&quot; led by Great Britain step in to fill the gap left by the sudden demise of American power.  The UK aid mission to the USA is the real ruler of the country, and America more or less ceases to exist as a unified country.  The standard of living plummets, people are hungry, and the future is bleak.<br />The story is told in the form of a semi-documentary.  Two reporters decide, five years after &quot;Warday&quot; (the war only lasted a portion of a single day) to tour the country, interview citizens, and find out the true state of the nation.  Their findings are depressing, and have a nightmarish authentic quality that is hard to describe.  It is very difficult to read this novel and not come away from it with the conviction that nuclear weapons are simply too terrible for use, and that their possession by rogue states is simply unacceptable.  This is one of those rare books that changed my basic thinking on an important subject.<br />All this having been said, the one flaw in &quot;Warday&quot; in my opinion is that it deliberately sets out to overstate what the effect would be of the scenario set out by the authors.  Just as Germany and Japan pulled themselves out of devastation after World War II, I have zero doubt that the American people would do the same under the horrific conditions portrayed in &quot;Warday.&quot;  In &quot;Warday&quot; the authors show an America that is flat on its back, out for the count, and not recovering.  I believe that America is made of sterner stuff.  This in no way takes away from the fact that &quot;Warday&quot; is utterly convincing as regards the notion that atomic weapons are too dangerous ever to be used again.<br />This book gets five stars for its imagination and the impact that it has on the reader.  Its characterization is pretty nominal, but for once this adds, rather than detracts, from the novel.  This is a story about America under a terrible, unthinkable scenario; not about individual people.  The authors pull it off brilliantly, and this book has every bit as much impact today as it did when it was published in 1984.er the horrific conditions portrayed in &quot;Warday.&quot;  In &quot;Warday&quot; the authors show an America that is flat on its back, out for the count, and not recovering.

This is one of those books that is quite literally unforgettable.  It is set circa 2025.  In this future, the world is horrendously overpopulated, and has been devastated by ecological havoc and neglect to the point where Earth's biosphere is in jeopardy of collapse.  A new world politician, Gupta Singh, believes he has the answer: the \\"Draft.\\"  Under this proposal, which has been secretly adopted by the United States and other countries, on a certain day all human beings would be required to simultaneously take a drug.  One third of the doses will be fatal, thereby reducing the world's population by a third in a single day, alleviating the world's population problems.<br />The authors do a wonderful job projecting current technology and ecological trends in a manner that projects a nightmarish future American and world society.  The rich enjoy extended life spans, penthouse living, and the benefits of high technology including sentient laptop computers and refrigerators that talk.  The rest of the world including most of America (which seems largely to be comprised of illegal aliens) lives in grinding poverty supported by a government dole.  Freedom is largely a thing of the past, the Tax Police have the power to effect summary arrests, and society in general is teetering on collapse.<br />This novel is intended to be a cautionary novel warning us against neglect of the world's ecology, and it delivers this message successfully, and in my opinion, devastatingly.  I am a conservative Republican, (a school of thought not always noted for its ecological conciousness) but nevertheless I admit that this novel heightened my concern for our preservation of the world's forests, oceans, and ecology.  Although I doubt that the future will be as grim as the authors show in this novel, nothing in the novel struck me as impossible, and much of it was too plausible for comfort.  This is a book that is worth reading because it will challenge the reader to think \\"outside the box\\" and examine his or her belief system.\\" and examine his or her belief system.	2003-06-02

The \\"Darwin's Radio--Darwin's Children\\" novels had the potential to be truly great science fiction.  In these novels, Greg Bear speculates about the future of human evolution as well as its possible mechanism.  I freely admit that some of Bear's science was over my head, however, he does manage to explain much of it in a clear fashion that is often quite interesting.<br />Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed \\"Darwin's Children\\" and read it in a long afternoon.  However, it disappoints the reader due to nonexistant character development, a murky and essentially nonexistent plot, a storyline that jumps around more than an old 78 rpm record, intrusive political preaching, and a strange tendency for all of the strong (physically and mentally) characters to be women and all of the men to be eunuchs.<br />Instead of focusing on the basics, like character development, plot, and a clear storyline, Bear inexplicably starts taking subtle jabs at conservative politics.  An ill patient's body \\"is like a body run by House Republicans...\\"  The novel's portrayal mistreatment of the evolved children by the Government is a not very subtle allegory of post-911 anti-terrorism measures.  This would be OK if there was a storyline and plot (authors are entitled to push their ideologies--that's part of what writing is for) but there just isn't.  The novel (if that's what it was) simply describes what is happening to the evolved children and a couple of their parents.  The story is murky and erratic.<br />In the \\"Kim Stanley Robinson\\" tradition, all of the strong characters in this novel are women.  Every single one.  The men are a form of 21st century eunuch--these chaps tend to follow along behind their women, care for the children, and mostly stay out of the way.  In this novel you will find women \\"standing guard,\\" running huge multinational companies, being cops, running Congress, and leading all scientific discovery.  Hey, I'm all for equal rights, but where did the men go and what happened to them?  I guess the same thing that happened in the Robinson Mars novels.  They shrank and disappeared.<br />Now, Bear plainly seems to have decided to speculate about human evolution rather than write a novel, which might have been OK, except that Bear does not do a very good job telling us what the evolved people are really like.  We learn that they communicate by smell a lot, and that women are in control among them (naturally) but that's about it.  Are they more intelligent?  Do they live longer?  Are they physically more healthy?  We never really learn.<br />Not that it matters all that much, but I found the notion that the evolved humans communicated alot by smell to be unlikely.  This is a trait many animals have (a dog's sense of smell is literally a million times more acute than a human's) and I personally am unconvinced that this retrograde trait is something humans are evolving towards.  But I digress.<br />An interesting read, but this novel and its prequel could have been much more had Bear paid more attention to the traditional jobs of the novelist: plot, storyline, and character development.appened to them?

As always when writing about the Mafia, Puzo tells a great story. This is the story of the Clericuzio crime family and the long range plan of its ruling Don to join the legitimate world and exit the Mafia, with the family wealth intact. This plan is fraught with peril and requires much bloodshed, setting the stage for the story.<br />The Godfather dealt with the Mafia from roughly the 1930s through the 1950s. This novel is more contemporary and appears to be set in the 1990s. Mostly, the story has an authentic quality to it, and it moves along at a very brisk pace. Puzo's prose is clear and makes the book a pleasure to read.<br />Some of the sub-plots in the novel are just plain unrealistic. For example, he explains how a Hollywood attorney and a \\"California Jury\\" fails to convict a murderer based on a temporary insanity defense, and a few months later the perp is walking the streets a free man.... But hey, makes a great story, anyway. And make no mistake, this is a minor quibble--this is a great story.<br />Puzo's portrayal of the movie business as being essentially as brutal as the Mafia is hilarious. Is it true to life? I doubt it, but it sure is entertaining.<br />The Last Don was made into a miniseries which is fairly faithful to the novel (Part 1 of the miniseries is, that is). If you enjoy the novel, the DVD of the miniseries is a great entertainment value.	2003-05-28

This is an excellent biography of General James Longstreet, CSA.  It is far from uncritical of Longstreet, but nevertheless more or less debunks some of the post-Civil War trashing of his reputation which occurred.  The author makes a pursuasive case that Longstreet was one of the first &quot;modern&quot; generals, who recognized that the Confederacy's conduct of the war had to take into account the strategic weaknesses of the South (smaller population, weaker industrial base) as well as the effect of industrialization on tactics (e.g. frontal assault tactic less viable against entrenched defenders, as shown at Fredricksburg and Gettysburg).  Lee's failure at Gettysburg was in significant part due to his failure to consider these factors, and the author makes a pretty good case that had Lee followed Longstreet's advice the battle and the war might have turned out differently.<br />Longstreet was controversial for many reasons--he was not a Virginian, thus some from that quarter were pleased to blame the failures of Lee's army on Longstreet.  It appears that the Confederate Army had its share of strong personalities with whom Longsteet bumped heads and egos both during and after the war.  And of course, there are many who venerate Lee and resist the idea that Lee made any mistakes, and Longstreet did criticize Lee's conduct at Gettysburg after the war.  And of course, Longstreet participated in the US Government after the war in a way that enraged many Southerners; in fact Longstreet became a Republican at a time when that party was the nexus of the &quot;punish the South&quot; school.  This made him the &quot;most hated man in the South.&quot;<br />Longstreet emerges in this book as a brave and capable commander, who was not afraid to expose himself to danger during battles, because he believed that this was part of the means by which a general had to lead his army.  This is largely a favorable book about Longstreet, but it is not uncritical.  The author does not hesitate to call Longstreet to account when he believes Longstreet acted wrongly.  For example, the author contends that Longstreet acted dishonorably when he sought a position in the Southern Army before fully resigning from the US Army, thereby courting an essentially hostile foreign Army while still subject to his oath as an officer in the US Army.<br />This is a thorough, very readable book.  It goes into very great detail as regards various battles and campaigns -- more than some casual readers will be able to appreciate--at times I found myself getting lost in battlefield details.  Nonetheless, this is a quite readable book which those with even a casual interest in the Civil War will appreciate.sitate to call Longstreet to account when he believes Longstreet acted wrongly.

The Atkins diet is a regime that works for many or most people.  For me, I have gotten back to the weight I was in high school by following the Atkins program.  I am a true believer.<br />As followers of Atkins know, the one thing you have to be pretty conscientious about is counting how many grams of carbohydrate are in your diet.  While this book is helpful for that, it is far from complete.  For example, I like to drink wine.  This book only lists a view varieties of alcoholic beverages as regards their carbohydrate gram count.  What I was hoping for when I bought this book was something that might have contained say, 3 or 4 dozen varieties of white wine and their gram counts.  But no.  Same with salad dressings--it would be great to have listings by brand, with dozens of brands.  Once again, this book only contains several brands.<br />This book is somewhat better than the gram count section contained at the back of Dr. Atkins book, (Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution) but not a lot better.  While this book may be the best available, someone out there would do well to publish a much more comprehensive guide.  Adherents of the Atkins program would probably snap it up.<br />The Atkins diet program is a program that works as Dr. Atkins describes it in his book.  A comprehensive guide to carbohydrate counts in brand-name foods would be helpful, but this guide falls short.	2003-04-03

This book is a superior elaboration on Dr. Atkins' earlier diet books, and is well worth owning and reading.  The Atkins diet, quite simply, works as advertised.  This book explains how to manage the diet, and it is easy to read and understand. Please note that I am nobody's medical expert, nutritionist, or doctor. The comments here are those of a layman.<br />As I explained in my review of one of Dr. Atkins' earlier books, in my experience this diet works precisely as Dr. Atkins says. I am a busy kind of guy (attorney) just like many of you. For me, a diet has to have two elements: I can't go around feeling hungry or weak while on it, and it has to work relatively quickly.<br />Well, this diet does both. I can now wear clothes that I had never thought I would be able to wear again.  In fact, I am now at the same weight I was at when I was in college.  I literally never feel hungry now that I am on this diet, even at mealtime, and I go through the day never feeling that ghastly weak, craving feeling that a low-calorie regime entails. This was vitally important to me--during the day and frankly all the time, I simply must feel energised. This diet provides that in spades.  When I tried the low-calorie approach I was constantly thinking about food.  Not on this diet.  On this diet you are in control--you are not ruled by your desire for food or looking forward to the next meal.<br />As far as results go, all I can say is that results exceed all expectations. I'm back to where I was before I decided that there was a problem. I'm wearing suits I simply couldn't wear before I went on the Atkins program. Suits that have hung in my coatroom, staring balefully at me, for the past several years.<br />I was on this diet for 7 years back in the 1980s and finally went off it in the late 80s because weight ceased being an issue in my life (the diet worked so well). I now see that going off of it was a mistake. I won't be repeating it. This diet is not really a diet. It is a way of life.<br />The only downside to this diet is that you really have to watch what you order in restaurants. Restaurants love to put carbohydrate sauces and dressings on everything, and you have to watch that. However, this book tells you how to manage this problem. I eat in restaurants every day and I manage fine.<br />Some reviewers talk negatively about the diet and imply that this diet involves chowing down on large amounts of high-fat foods.  Not so.  Sure, you can have real cream in your coffee and you can enjoy that nice steak.  The difference is that if you do it on this diet you will not gain weight.  It is as simple as that.  You can have salad and certain other green vegetables in reasonable quantities.  Frankly, I probably eat a better variety of green vegetables and salads than I did before I went on this diet.  The Atkins program mainly involves cutting out bread, sugary cereals, and yes (alas) most fruit.  The few sacrifices it involves (and they are few and well-compensated) are well rewarded by the amazing improvement in one's body, and in the way you feel.  This is a great program well-explained in this book.<br />  If you are having trouble managing your body weight (and who, after age 40, is not?) this book and the Atkins program deserve your attention.of life.<br />The only downside to this diet is that you really have to watch what you order in restaurants.

This is a novel that showcases many of DeMille's strengths as a writer--it manages to be incredibly sad in parts, and utterly hilarious in others.  This is a military detective story, and probably the best one I've ever read.  DeMille's authenticity as regards military life in the modern Army is total--he transports the reader into the military culture--which is a culture derived from American culture but nonetheless profoundly separate from it.<br />The daughter of the Commanding General of Ft. Hadley has been murdered under bizarre circumstances.  DeMille's protagonist, Warrant Officer Brenner, a detective of the Army CID, is detailed to discover who, how, and why.  This novel is written in the first person from Brenner's perspective and in this novel this perspective works brilliantly.  Brenner and his teammate, WO Sunhill, discover that finding the answers to the riddle is like peeling an onion--with multiple layers of intrigue and corruption surrounding the circumstances of the victim's death.  Brenner's observations about the investigation, military life, and his approach to crime-busting are all fascinating, possess a wry but sad humor, and contain a gritty authenticity that make this story highly plausible.  The characters crackle with life and realism.  The story develops smartly and never drags.<br />This is one of those books that you won't put down. The ending is climactic and startling--and incredibly sad.  I was depressed for days after reading this novel, but since then I have read it several more times.  This book is an incredibly \\"good read\\" and anyone who likes suspense novels will enjoy it thoroughly.  Few will read this novel without being moved by it.	2003-02-23

Thus, the universe is not well-travelled, the technology does not work perfectly, the nonhuman races are truly alien because humans have limited experience in dealing with aliens.<br />This novel does a good job of exploiting the above potentials.  It is about a first contact between the starship Enterprise (Earth's first deep-space faster-than-light cruiser) and a very unusual planet which features two very different intelligent races.  The plot is solid, and there is some decent character development, particularly in connection with T'Pol and Archer.  This is not great literature, but the novel certainly qualifies as a pleasent diversion into the Star Trek universe--which is a universe to which I like to pay frequent visits.	2003-02-16

This is a splendid analysis of the Battle of Midway as seen from the Japanese side. The authors had firsthand knowledge of the plans, actions, mistakes, strengths, and weaknesses of the Imperial Japanese Navy in connection with the Battle of Midway, and they pull no punches telling us about the battle. The Battle of Midway turned the tide of the Pacific War for all time against Japan, as an outnumbered and outmatched, but plucky, U.S. Navy inflicted a devastating defeat on the greatest carrier force ever assembled up to that time. This book goes far in explaining how this miracle took place. The authors tell us about the dithering of the Japanese commander as to whether to strike Midway again, or to strike the American fleet, or do a hasty strike against the American fleet before all his planes were recovered--and how this indecision helped lose a battle that almost could not be lost. So too did the sloppiness of the deck crews, who stacked bombs and torpedos carelessly on the decks of the carriers as the Admiral kept changing his mind--this ordinance of course exploded when the American dive bombers attacked, ensuring that three Japanese carriers went to the bottom, rather than having a chance of surviving through damage control. The book is filled with excellent details like this.<br />The authors also do a fine job explaining the motivations and outlooks of the Japanese leaders, including the great famed Admiral Yamamoto--who evidently reacted to the Doolittle Raid by pushing for the attack on Midway. This key decision signed Japan's death warrant as regards the Pacific war. Had Japan instead turned west and attacked Russia, this could have changed the entire complexion of the war, as Germany might have prevailed against Russia, forcing the US to divert even more resources in its \\"Germany First\\" policy. The authors reveal how close Japan may have been to adopting this strategy.<br />This book impresses the reader not just with the mistakes the Japanese made, but also of the tenacity, skill, and competence of the former Japanese foe. The book was written in the early 1950s and the authors' viewpoints are somewhat overly colored by the aftermath of defeat--Japan had not yet shaken off the trauma of defeat and this pessimism about Japan's prospects is readily apparent. I trust the authors lived to see that in reality the Japanese people won, not lost, the war by becoming a prosperous and democratic economic powerhouse.<br />Incidentally, it appeared clear to me that the movie \\"Battle of Midway\\" with Henry Fonda was essentially based on this book.<br />This is a fine analysis of the most important battle of the Pacific War and constitutes essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the Battle of Midway and the reasons that Japan was defeated in both the battle and the war.also of the tenacity, skill, and competence of the former Japanese foe.

He did this by more or less equal portions of intelligence, good chemistry with Adolf Hitler, and ambition.  Speer was the Nazi Minister for War Production and Armaments, and most historians agree that he was extremely effective in this role--thus he shares responsibility for the horrors that the Nazis unleashed.<br />Speer overall comes across as a decent man who nevertheless let his ambition blind him to, or cause him to rationalize, the ugliness of the regime he served.  Speer was very much under the spell of Adolf Hitler until he realized that the regime was doomed and the war was lost.  Even as Speer wrote this book in prison it is plain that he still was proud of the esteem in which Hitler held him, despite the fact that by then he had seen Hitler for the monster he was.  The one question that the book did not answer to my satisfaction was how much Speer knew about the concentration camp system and the genocide it perpetrated.  He plainly knew a lot, because as War Production Minister he drafted camp inmates into German war industry.  Did he know about the genocides and exterminations?  Perhaps this is unknowable.<br />\\"Inside the Third Reich\\" is unusually revealing, both about the Nazi regime and the personality of Hitler the man.  Speer truly was an insider, almost on a par with such figures as Goering or Goebbels.  Many of Speer's observations are extremely insightful, and retain their relevance today.  For example, Speer reveals that Hitler was very reluctant to ask the German people to accept sacrifices for war production because, in the final analysis, he knew that his regime did not derive its power from the will of the people.  The Nazis accordingly lacked confidence in their own legitimacy and were reluctant to impose sacrifices on the public--even as Great Britain and the United States mobilized for total war and (Britain in particular) did require their citizens to make sacrifices.  Speer thus exposes the myth that totalitarian states are more fitted for war than are liberal republican countries.<br />This book is a bit longer than it needs to be, no doubt as a function of the fact that Speer wrote most of it during his twenty-year Nuremberg-imposed prison sentence.  He had lots of time to write.  Despite its length, this is a fine book and those interested in what made the Nazi regime tick will find this book to be a valuable and worthwhile read.ar) did require their citizens to make sacrifices.

John Lehman was a highly motivated, restless, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan.  He took an active role in formulating strategy, much to the discomfort of some serving uniformed officers.  This book by him focuses on the early American Navy, its battles, history, and development.  It further looks at Lehman's controversial &quot;forward strategy&quot; during the Reagan Administration.<br />Some reviewers have pointed out errors in the text which perhaps may be attributed to bad editing or faulty research, and I will leave these criticisms to others since I probably don't know enough about it.  What I will say is that this book is a very good read, and is plainly a labor of love by a man who plainly loves the US Navy and takes great pride in both his role as SecNav and the service of earlier members of his family.  The Navy has often been an instrument of American destiny, and that is what this book is about.  Most readers will probably forgive the mistakes and appreciate Lehman's presentation of the Navy to the general public.	2003-02-02

I first came upon it when inventorying my late father's estate, which contained a very old, thoroughly-thumbed and dog-eared copy dating to the first edition. (Dad was a veteran of the Pacific war). I could not put the book down. \\"Zero!\\" is a thoroughly honest, non-jingoistic view of the aerial component of the Pacific war from the Japanese perspective, beginning with \\"The Sino-Japanese Incident\\" (Japan's war of aggression against China) through the defeat of Japan by the United States. While not everything in the book is necessarily correct, I believe that most or all readers will agree that the authors were scrupulously honest in their writing, and they convey the facts of the war as they saw it.<br />The title of the book, \\"Zero\\" reflects the authors' view that the design characteristics of the famed Zero fighter aircraft were central to Japan's waging of the Pacific war. As of 7 December 1941 the Zero could outfly, outdistance, and outfight any fighter that the United States had in service, and was rightly feared and respected by allied fighter pilots. So were the Japanese pilots themselves, who were largely battle-hardened veterans of tough aerial campaigns over China fought during the late 1930s. The Zero's range and other attributes were what made much of Japan's Pacific campaign possible, as the Zero had an unprecedented combat radius which the authors explain was central to Japan's strategy of establishing a tough perimeter for its aspiring empire.<br />The book is fascinating. It fully explains how the earlier American fighters were outclassed by the Zero, how the P-38 Lockheed Lightning was the first viable answer by America to the Zero (it had wildly different flight characteristics which required both sides to modify their tactics), and how finally, by late 1943 newer American designs i.e. the Hellcat, Mustang, and Corsair, finally relegated the Zero to obsolescence even as America gained the upper hand.<br />Other wonderful insights abound. Japan never gave its heros medals, not even to the great Japanese pilot/ace Saburo Sakai (a great chapter is devoted to him--see also the book \\"Samurai\\" and my review thereof)-- the authors' regret and perhaps resentment of this policy is plain. Japan was in awe of America's ability to hugely supply distant outposts shortly after launching an invasion--Japanese forces in the Pacific were always undersupplied and not only due to American action--the Japanese never really developed a modern logistical capability equal to the demands of global war. Similarly, the authors lament that Japan simply did not attach importance to such things as insect control and other dimensions of jungle hygiene for their outposts. This lowered the efficiency of the men markedly, as no doubt bureaucrats in Tokyo expected the men in distant jungles to overcome disease, hunger, and discomfort with warrior zeal. And yet, throughout all of this, the American reader will gain a respect for the determination, discipline and dedication of the Japanese foe of the time.<br />I have never read a better book about the Pacific war.

Saburo Sakai was a national hero in Japan as its greatest surviving air ace of world war two.  This book is his story.  It is a fascinating and honest look at the air war in the Pacific from the Japanese perspective.  Sakai is shown to have been a patriotic and heroic fighter, who, like most soldiers, gave little thought to the politics of the war.  Like young men in many lands in many times, when his country called, he answered.<br />Sakai gives us an honest assessment of both sides as regards the Pacific air war.  There is little or no jingoism here.  He highlights some of the critical mistakes that the Japanese navy made in the war--one of which was that before the war the Navy only turned out about 100 pilots a year--not remotely enough for the total war Japan was about to wage against the world's greatest industrial power.  The standards for entering and graduating from the Naval air training course in Japan were unreasonably high, and simply prevented the country from producing the number of pilots it would come to need.  When the Americans eliminated over 300 Japanese pilots in 3 days at the Battle of Midway, Japan never recovered the loss of these trained men. On the other hand, Sakai reminds the American reader that in the Japanese America faced a motivated, intelligent, and very brave foe deriving from a violent military tradition.<br />The book also includes some very interesting glimpses at the Japanese home front during the war.  Life in prewar Japan was hard for the lower classes--sufficiently hard that even the savage discipline (which Sakai describes at length) of the Japanese Navy appeared to be a reasonable alternative to the grinding poverty he otherwise faced.<br />Overall, a wonderful look at &quot;the other side of the hill&quot; and into the mind of one of World War Two's greatest air combat pilots.	2003-01-27

I feel unworthy writing a review of this work, but I was so impressed with it that I feel moved to do so.  I had been putting off reading this book for years, simply due to its volume--over 1100 tightly packed pages.  But believe me, anyone who wants to understand how WW2 came to be, and what the Nazis were all about, should read this one.<br />William Shirer was a journalist in Europe during most of the Third Reich's duration, and his first-hand experience with the major figures of the era give this book a wonderful, authentic feel.  This is not a dull work of scholarship (as I had feared!) It is a priceless well-written and thorough history of the Third Reich.  Shirer himself notes that perhaps a better history could be written 50-100 years following the war, with the benefit of detached perspective.  However, this book proves that the opposite is also true--had Shirer not written this book we might never have had the opportunity to read a thorough work on this topic by one who observed much of the actual events and who saw and met many of the key figures of the Third Reich.<br />Neville Chamberlain springs to life as one of the most craven politicians ever.  Other figures of the time are vividly portrayed.  After completing this book I felt that I had a much better understanding as to why the sellout at Munich, and World War II in general, have had such a profound effect upon the politics of the modern era--not merely because of the horrific death and destruction that the war entailed, but because of the tragically bad decisions that resulted in the war itself.<br />Anyone who wants to understand the European portion of WW2 should read this book.

McCullough's &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series is a remarkable achievement.  Who can fail to be in awe of McCullough's research, focus, and dedication?<br />&quot;The October Horse&quot; is essentially the story of Caesar's adventure in Egypt, his subsequent assassination, and the subsequent rise of his designated heir, Octavius Caesar.  It is possible to learn a lot of late Republican Roman history by reading this book.<br />In &quot;the October Horse&quot; McCullough's writing is much less like a novel and much more like a historical summary than the rest of this series.  Her prose is less intimate, more detached, and frankly, less clear and direct than her other books.  From this standpoint the novel was a disappointment to me.  I also felt that McCullough glossed over Julius Caesar's evident megalomania in his latter days.  Possibly because McCullough is herself so enamored of Caesar, whom she portrays as virtually a god on earth, she seems to gloss over Caesar's frank undermining of the key institutions of the Roman Republic.  Once Caesar became dictator for life, the Republic never recovered and eventually declined into the Imperium.<br />One strong point of the novel is that it does a pretty good job of portraying Octavius Caesar.  By the end of the novel I felt that I knew him, and that I understood how he was able to rise to eventually become Rome's first emperor.<br />I would have liked the novel better if it had focused more on how the Roman Republic was ultimately destroyed by Caesar and Octavius (and, to be fair, by their enemies including Cato and his &quot;Good Men&quot;).  I felt that the novel would have been better had McCullogh engaged in more novelization and less historical summary.  Despite these criticisms (which, to be fair, not everyone may agree with) the novel is a good read and certainly constitutes fine historical fiction.	2002-12-22

This is a well written book that explains (some of) the theory behind the famous Atkins Diet, and how to behave on the diet.  It is easy to read and understand.  Please note that I am nobody's medical expert, nutritionist, or doctor.  The comments here are those of a layman.<br />As far as the content goes, in my experience this diet works precisely as Dr. Atkins' book says.  I am a busy kind of guy (attorney) just like many of you.  For me, a diet has to have two elements: I can't go around feeling hungry or weak while on it, and it has to work relatively quickly.<br />Well, this diet does both.  After about 2 days on the diet I experienced what can only be described as a burst of energy.  I literally never feel hungry now that I am on this diet, even at mealtime, and I go through the day never feeling that ghastly weak, craving feeling that a lo-calorie regime entails.  This was vitally important to me--during the day and frankly all the time, I simply must feel energised.  This diet provides that in spades.<br />As far as results go, all I can say is that results exceed all expectations.  I'm back to where I was before I decided that there was a problem.  I'm wearing suits I simply couldn't wear a month ago.  Suits that have hung in my coatroom, staring balefully at me, for the past several years.<br />I was on this diet for 7 years back in the 1980s and finally went off it in the late 80s because weight ceased being an issue in my life (the diet worked so well).  I now see that going off of it was a mistake.  I won't be repeating it.  This diet is not really a diet.  It is a way of life.<br />The only downside to this diet is that you really have to watch what you order in restaurants.  Restaurants love to put carbohydrate sauces and dressings on everything, and you have to watch that.  However, this book tells you how to manage this problem.  I eat in restaurants every day and I manage fine.<br />This book is the only diet book I've ever seen or heard of that is worth a darn.  If you are having trouble managing your body weight (and who, after age 40, is not?) this book deserves your attention.is worth a darn.

Nanotechnology is the science of manufacturing microscopic machines.  This novel speculates about what might happen if this technology ran amok.<br />I've read nearly all of Crichton's books, and this one is remarkably different from the others as regards the writing style.  This novel is not written with Crichton's usual detached, third-person style, moving periodically among characters.  Instead, the narrative is in the first person--everything is seen from the perspective of one protagonist, who slowly, gradually, realizes the horror of the situation in which he finds himself.  The overall effect of this change in style is that the book is a much easier read than most of Crichton's other work.  In fact, it is fair to say that more than most of Crichton's other novels, this one is a real page-turner.  Mostly he does not sacrifice depth for this, and he does achieve a higher degree of clarity than in some of his other novels, notably &quot;Timeline.&quot;<br />Some of Crichton's scientific prognostications are (as usual for him) absolutely fascinating.  He clearly and convincingly explains how nanotechnology may come together as a fusion between mechanical and genetic engineering, and computer science.  Unfortunately, in my opinion in this novel he goes a bit too &quot;far out&quot; in that I did not find his speculation about the ultimate conclusion of the technology to be plausible.  Most Crichton novels pass the &quot;plausibility test&quot;--even &quot;Timeline&quot; did an acceptable job of suggesting a convincing scenario in which time travel might be possible--a difficult task indeed.  While I found some of Crichton's speculation about where nanotechnology might lead to be fascinating, some parts of this speculation seemed forced and ultimately not believable.  This lack of plausibility dropped this one to three stars in my opinion.<br />The ending of the novel is also not very satisfying.  Crichton could have done better.  Spoilers omitted here.<br />Despite the flaws mentioned here, this book is a ripping good read and every Crichton fan or lover of science fiction will want to read this one.this one to three stars in my opinion.<br />The ending of the novel is also not very satisfying.

Unlike many of Uris' other works, this book is crisply written, the story moves at a fast pace, the ending is climactic, and the characters are vivid.  The protagonist, Andre Devereaux, is unforgettable.<br />This is a novel essentially of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It also deals with postwar French foreign policy under De Gaulle (thinly disguised as &quot;Le Croix&quot; in the novel).  The novel is told from the perspective of Devereaux, a French intelligence officer.  Devereaux must deal with his knowledge of the Soviet activities in Cuba as well as Soviet penetration of the French government.<br />This is a fine novel.  Unlike many of Uris' other novels, it does not bog down, and the characters behave like real people.  There are no idealized characters--each person is shown complete with flaws and foibles.  Recommended.	2002-11-16

I thought that this book was, at best, mediocre.  It is written more or less at about a 9th grade level.  The characters don't act like real people, and they are all given to long windy speeches about all sorts of things.  The characters are all given to going off on windy, whiny recitations of Heinlein's beliefs on this or that subject.  The \\"Jubal\\" character in particular never shuts up.  I wanted to shoot him by the time I had finished the novel.<br />Although this book has gotten considerable acclaim from certain quarters, no doubt due to its counterculture message, I personally found it to be a bore.  Heinlein has written other, better novels (e.g. Starship Troopers) which offer superior alternatives to this one.<br />Not recommended.	2002-11-16

I have always been fascinated by rattlesnakes, ever since living in the heart of California's rattlesnake country as a young lad. This book covers the subject in loving and fascinating detail, with loads of superb photographs which splendidly support the excellent text.  These are magnificent and beneficial animals and the author does a superb job of writing about them.<br />My only criticism of the book is that it spends a lot of time dealing with human activities as regards rattlesnakes, such as the notorious \\"rattlesnake roundups,\\" which the author rightly explains to be unconscionable predations by man against innocent and essential creatures. I would have rather seen even more space devoted to a pure scientific study of rattlers. But this is a minor quibble, and many will doubtless disagree with me because these sections are very well done and interesting.<br />The book's scientific discussion of rattlesnakes is very interesting. These are amazing creatures and the author plainly is highly motivated by the subject. This book is a labor of love in which the reader will delight to share.<br />This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in rattlers.	2002-11-16

This book is, quite simply, a fabulous trilogy of novels.  It deals, of course, with the two-year voyage of HMS Bounty from England to Tahiti, the captaincy of Captain William Bligh, the mutiny against him, and the aftermath.  This is an unforgettable story, beautifully told, well-written, and fast-paced.<br />I have read reviews here and there that claim this book is written at a &quot;young adult&quot; level.  Not so.  This is a complex story that only seems to be easily told because the author has mastered the ability to write with utter clarity, and without sacrificing style.  As one who reads all day for a living (attorney) I have learned to appreciate authors who can write well.  Nordhoff does this--the reader never loses the storyline because it is well told.  The novels proceed with the precision of a laser beam but with a poetic, wistful, thoughtful tone that is a delight to read.  This book has class.<br />The story of the trip to Tahiti and the mutiny which takes place early on the return voyage are wonderfully told.  The ONLY possible criticism is that this story is not terribly true to the facts of the actual mutiny.  The protagonist, Roger Byam, is an imaginary person.  By the way, this novel is the source for the first of the Mutiny on the Bounty movies starring Charles Laughton.<br />The other two novels in the trilogy deal with the voyage by Captain Bligh and those of the crew who remained loyal to him, and the aftermath of the mutiny when the mutineers settle on Pitcairn Island.  Both stories are first-rate.<br />Persons interested in a somewhat more accurate depiction of what happened on the Bounty voyage, as well as a ripping good movie, will want to see &quot;The Bounty&quot; starring Mel Gibson (Fletcher Christian) and Anthony Hopkins (Captain Bligh).<br />The Bounty Trilogy is a book anyone who enjoys adventure will want to read and own.	2002-11-16

This is an extraordinary novel of the same genre as \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman.\\"  It portrays the imaginary life of one Declan Walsh.  The author's stylistic method is extraordinarily effective.  The author uses as a setting a reporter interviewing three different (imaginary) intimates of Walsh.  Each of these interviewees: a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant, a Supreme Court Justice, and a Catholic Cardinal, paints a different portrayal of Walsh, and incidentally also presents the reader with a fascinating character study in his own right.<br />In the novel, Declan Walsh lives an extraordinary life: he is a Medal of Honor winner in Korea, he later becomes Chief Justice of the United States.  He resigns his post on the Supreme Court in the face of personal tragedy, and later is selected as Pope by a deadlocked Church conclave.<br />My favorite portion of the novel is the first third, which deals with Walsh as a Marine Corps battalion commander in Korea.  The depiction of men in combat, the leadership issues,  the life and death decisions, and above all the hard fighting and hard dying are powerfully done.  The reader can feel the cold Korean night, and share the Marines' honest fear and bravery as tough infantry combat rages.  I have never read a more realistic and authentic story of men in combat.<br />The second section of the novel deals with Walsh as Chief Justice.  The legal issues are pretty much passe' now--they deal with issues circa 1964-1975.  However, this portion of the novel retains its relevance despite this because it gives an interesting insight into the decision making process within the Court, and again the portrayal of Walsh is wonderfully done.<br />The last section of the novel deals with Walsh as Pope.  It is not dated in any significant way, because the Church has not grappled with most of the issues portrayed in the novel.  Again, the author takes us into the Catholic Church and explains some of the politics, infighting, and differences in ideology that permeat the world's oldest beauracracy.  One need not be a Catholic to find this fascinating.<br />The best thing about this novel is the quality of the writing.  Murphy's prose is clear, wonderfully stylistic, and extremely entertaining.  Many of the characters in the novel literally seem to spring to life, so well done are Murphy's characterizations.  Murphy's characters act and seem like real people living real lives at all times. I have read this novel many times over the years and I regard it as one of the best reads I have ever experienced.  Highly recommended.ogy that permeat the world's oldest beauracracy.

These are interrelated short stories that deal with time travel, generally referred to as Anderson's \\"Time Patrol\\" series.  In this series, man achieves time travel many millenia from now.  To prevent time travelers from altering the past repeatedly (as is entirely possible in Anderson's universe) evolved men (\\"Danellians\\") from even further uptime establish the \\"Time Patrol.\\" The mission of the Time Patrol is to prevent time travellers from altering the \\"true\\" past.<br />There are some excellent stories in this collection.  \\"Brave To Be A King\\" is my particular favorite.  In this story a time traveller is marooned in ancient Persia in the time of Cyrus the Great and becomes \\"enmeshed in the local gears.\\"  In fact, he becomes Cyrus!  But despite being a King, he desperately wants to go home!  This is a wonderful story with a gritty realism.  Highly recommended.<br />The only downside to this collection is that you cannot appreciate it one story at a time, because to fully grasp each story you must understand the underlying \\"Time Patrol\\" premise.  But Anderson takes care of that deftly, because the first story in the collection deals with the recruitment of a 1950s American into the Time Patrol.  Not only is this a ripping good story, it does a good job of setting the reader up for the other stories in this collection and in the series.  If you like this book, you'll also want to read Anderson's other Time Patrol collections, including \\"The Time Patrol\\" and \\"The Shield of Time.\\"	2002-11-16

This is a very fine novel by Clarke even if some of the science is now out-of-date.  The novel is set several centuries in the future.  There are essentially two \\"nations\\" remaining, Earth (which includes the Moon) and the Triplanetary Federation, which encompasses Mars, Venus, and some of the outer satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.  The issue is that in this novel Earth controls most of the solar system's supply of heavy metals e.g. titanium, high-grade iron ore, etc.  Therein lies the conflict.<br />After several centuries of peace, the possibility of war once again looms.  Clarke creates the atmosphere for this masterfully.<br />The story is told from the perspective of an intelligence agent sent from Earth on a counterintelligence mission on the Moon.  The storyline does not move at a breakneck pace by any means.  Rather, the story moves in a leisurely fashion that gives the reader a fascinating look at what a Moon colony might one day be like.  Despite this, the book moves to a climactic ending that is startling and absorbing.  This book is an excellent read.<br />This is a book that might have been made into a movie.  Clarke is one of the giants of science fiction. Highly recommended.	2002-11-16

In this one, Hornblower is dispatched to the Baltic in command of a squadron of British vessels, as Britain's struggle with Napoleon nears its climax.  Hornblower must deal with all of the usual problems of command, and additionally he must, in fact, also concern himself with high affairs of state.  Forester combines these factors brilliantly into a facinating look at Europe during this time period.<br />I found this novel to be particularly vivid in its portrayal of Hornblower marauding about in the Baltic.  You can practically feel the cold Baltic air, see the ice flows, hear the cannon, and see the armies ashore battling one another.  Hornblower as usual is in the thick of things.  This book in my opinion never drags although the storyline is somewhat more complex than the usual Hornblower novel.<br />Fans of Hornblower won't want to miss this one.  And if you are not a Hornblower afficianado, then what are you waiting for?	2002-11-16

Forester's \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series, this book is a must and a delight. Horatio Hornblower was a fictional British naval officer during the time of the Napoleonic Wars, and his adventures are fictionalized in the Forester novels.  I believe that the Hornblower series constitutes the best sea adventures in all of literature. Horatio Hornblower is unforgettable, both in the novels and in Parkinson's \\"Life and Times...\\"<br />This book is a great read. It contains fascinating little facts about Hornblower, but in my opinion the best part of the book is that it chronicles Hornblower's career in a manner that allows the reader to compare the reality (which this book presents)with Forester's wonderful stories. The result is absolutely engrossing. I always thought that in Forester's novels Hornblower had too many adventures for one real person to have had.  Parkinson does a fine job of showing us that if anything, Hornblower's life was filled with even more adventure than presented in Forester's novels.<br />Parkinson answers numerous other questions I always had about Hornblower, such as why Bush was not promoted after the South American voyage, what Lady Barbara was really like and, most important--how did Captain Sawyer come to fall down the hold on HMS Renown? This book answers these questions and others as best it can, and this adds to the book's fascination.<br />Another thing to like about this book is that it does a good job of placing Hornblower within 19th Century British society. The Forester novels pretty much concentrate on Hornblower's sea adventures. American readers in particular will appreciate Parkinson's insights into the nature of the society in which Hornblower lived, and Horblower's place within it.<br />The next sentence will possibly confuse some readers.  This book is a work of fiction.<br />This book is well-written, well-researched and is quite simply a book that every Hornblower afficianado will want to own, read, and re-read.	2002-11-14

I give this book 5 stars for its subject matter and detail, but two stars for the quality of writing, averaging to 4 stars overall.<br />This book will literally overwhelm you with detail, and to that extent it is a staggering achievement.  There is a huge amount of detail here about political, military, and social figures of the Civil War era--more than most readers frankly would ever want to know.  Is it accurate?  Beats me.  Is it interesting?  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  For example, Safire creates an unforgettable characterization of Albert Sidney Johnston, the great Confederate general of the Western theater.  On the other hand, there is far more detail here about Rose Greenhow, Kate Chase, and others too numerous to mention than I can imagine anyone wanting to know.  And I speak as a Civil War buff of sorts.<br />This is in fact the story of the Civil War from the election of Abraham Lincoln to the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.  A pivotal time in America's history, and Safire is right to assume that this subject merits close attention.  This is a book you can truly immerse yourself in.<br />Unfortunately, the novel is pretty heavy going as a consequence of the vast amount of detail, and the rapidly and constantly changing characters and points of view.  Safire's prose is heavy almost as though he himself is staggering under the weight of the details he presents.  Well, that's how it seemed to me anyway.<br />This is not a book for the casual reader.  But there is a lot here, and if you put in the effort (and it can be a pleasent effort) you will be both entertained and educated.	2002-11-13

Unforgettable	This book is the 5th in the \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series by C.S. Forester. It is in my opinion the best book of the series, and this is high praise, because this is one of the best adventure series in all of literature.<br />In this novel, Captain Hornblower, Captain of HMS Lydia, a British frigate, is dispatched to the west coast of South America, on a mission to make trouble for Spain, which has allied itself with Napoleon, against whom Britain is in a desperate struggle. At first, all seems to go well, but events beyond Hornblower's control intervene, and soon he is fighting battles and using his wits. It is all wonderful adventure.<br />Forester's writing is taut. His storyline is brisk. The novel moves from adventure to adventure in a manner that is absolutely absorbing. This book never drags. This is a story of adventure and hardship. Captain Hornblower, El Supremo, Lady Barbara are all unforgettable. The battles at sea are so real you can smell the powder.

This is the story of Hornblower as the junior lieutenant aboard HMS Renown, a British Ship of the Line.  This one is probably tied in my mind with \\"Beat to Quarters\\" as the best Hornblower novel.  The Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester is, quite simply, the best in naval adventure literature.<br />In this novel, the Renown is dispatched to the West Indies on a secret mission.  The captain becomes incapacitated, and the ship's second in command is nowhere near up to the job of captaining the Renown.  Hornblower's intelligence and leadership ability must overcome the fact that he is a junior officer who must at all times be deferential to his superiors.  And yet only Hornblower has a clear idea as to how the Renown might accomplish its mission.  How he handles his superior officers under these circumstances is a wonderful study in character and leadership.<br />This is a novel about leadership, and how Hornblower, an emerging leader, deals with a series of crises.  This book starts at a sprint and before it is done it breaks the sound barrier--the action never stops, and yet somehow in this novel there is time for analysis and introspection also.  Forester's writing is fast-paced, his storyline never dawdles or drags.<br />This is one you'll want in hardbound form.  I have one in near-mint condition, and another beat-up copy that I read every year or so!  (That way my nice copy stays nice.  I just can't imagine not being able to read this novel whenever I want to!) This one is a keeper.	2002-11-12

This is a novel well worth reading because it makes you think.  As always, Hogan is trying to think outside the box, and he tries to make the reader to do the same.  In that, he succeeds in this very worthwhile novel.<br />The time is the late 21st century.  There has been a third world war, and America and the world has more or less recovered from the aftermath.  But America is transformed into a near-fascist state.  There are hints that the Asians are practicing liberal democracy and that the Europeans are more or less junior rivals to America.<br />The novel involves a race by the three powers (America, Europe, and Asia) to re-establish contact with a colony established on Alpha Centauri's main planet--the colony had been jointly established prior to the war.  The Americans arrive first, and the clash between the Americans and the colonists is the central theme of the book.<br />The main notion of the book is that people and nations carry their prejudices from generation to generation, and that it may take some form of \\"fresh start\\" to eliminate these prejudices.  Hogan notes that America represented such a fresh start when it was founded, and Americans have shaken off much in the way of class structure and other undesireable components of European culture.  Likewise, in his novel, the colonists have made a \\"fresh start,\\" and have abolished racial prejudice (or even racial awareness), as well as any concept of a market economy or of the anglo-saxon justice system.<br />Hogan's basic premise makes sense--that a fresh start such as took place in America might help eradicate ancient prejudices.  As he writes elsewhere, if we could somehow get one generation of the folks in Northern Ireland away from their parent's prejudices, this ancient quarrel would doubtless end for all time.<br />Unfortunately, some of Hogan's speculation fails to hold water.  His replacement for a justice system is having people shoot bad guys out of hand.  Only trouble with this is that it is exactly what people used to do a couple of centuries ago.  This caused feuding and an endless cycle of family reprisals.  So we invented courts.  Here, Hogan has us going backwards, candidly probably due to his lack of historical knowledge in this regards.  Similarly, Hogan postulates that the Centaurian colonists would abandone money and a market system because everyone would work their fair share and take their fair share--the notion is that productivity is so high with modern technology that there is no need to ration resources.  Nonsense, as the fall of socialism/communism has shown.  Human greed is limitless and there will always be a need to somehow ration labor and resources.  Here, Hogan makes a nice try that falls flat.  These are not major quibbles, by the way.<br />As a novel, Voyage From Yesteryear is so-so.  The characters are not well developed, the storyline is murky, and the book rambles.  In one sense you always know where it is going--a clash between the Americans and the colonists.  But other than this broad theme, the book rambles erratically.  You might think that these flaws render the book mediocre.  That is not true.  This novel's strengths are its ideas and speculations about both science and human societies.  It is quite readable and does constitute a good read.<br />This is an interesting book with interesting ideas and speculation.

Most of us are slow to change our opinions about \\"big issues.\\"  That is a normal human trait.  This book may actually cause you to do that about various issues, including the problem of AIDS, the issue about CFCs and the \\"Ozone Hole\\" and certain other trendy issues of the day.<br />This book is a reprint of various science articles Hogan has written, a couple of science fiction short stories, and a few personal anecdotes.  If you are a Hogan fan, you'll like most of this book.  If you are not a Hogan fan, you very likely will STILL like the science articles.  They are dazzling, well-written, and understandable to the layman.<br />The most important part of the book is Hogan's analysis of the AIDS controversy.  He points out numerous facts that the ordinary news media has refused to tell us.  For example, no one has ever proved that the HIV virus causes AIDS.  When you culture the HIV virus and try to infect a chimp or other animal, there is not a single case of the animal contracting AIDS.  Nor are there any documented cases of a human being contracting AIDS by being infected with the HIV virus, unless such person was either a drug user, a hemophiliac, or a member of a similar risk group.  This defies \\"Koch's Theorem,\\" a basic premise of biology, which says that being able to predictably cause a disease (i.e. AIDS) by infecting a host with a virus (i.e. HIV) is a basic requirement for concluding that the virus causes the disease.  If the \\"HIV causes AIDS\\" theory fails this test, then why do we believe that HIV does in fact cause AIDS?  Hogan suggests some answers, and it's not pretty, but it's pretty darned thought-provoking.  I am no scientist myself, but I will admit that Hogan managed to force me to \\"think outside the box\\" of conventional wisdom on this one.<br />Similarly, Hogan's article \\"Fact-Free Science\\" questions whether CFCs have caused the \\"Ozone Hole\\" or, in fact, whether the \\"Ozone Hole\\" even actually exists as a man-made (or a dangerous) phenomena.  If you are an environmental activist who believes this, at the very least Hogan's book will give your belief structure a good workout.  It will make ordinary people question.<br />Hogan consistently tries to think outside of the box.  This is a recurrent theme in most of his writing.  Sometimes he succeeds, sometimes, in my opinion, he fails. (The \\"Justice System\\" in \\"Voyage to Yesteryear,\\" another one of his novels, was idiotic, and its economic system was asinine.)  But at least he is thinking, and trying to make YOU think.  That's more than most writers ever do.<br />This is a book well worth reading and owning.  I have bought copies for friends, who are sometimes angered and sometimes stunned, by the facts Hogan brings to light.  I would say that he made them think as well.<br />Recommended.you are an environmental activist who believes this, at the very least Hogan's book will give your belief structure a good workout.

This is a wonderful novel set in \\"The One World\\"--the land of pre-Columbian Mexico/Central America as it was called by the inhabitants.  It is about the life of one Aztec adventurer immediately prior to, and then during, the coming of Captain Cortez and the Spanish Conquistadores.<br />Jennings' novel presents a fascinating society utterly unlike our own, but every bit as rational and civilized, albeit that it had certain attributes we now consider barbaric, e.g. human sacrifice as a component of religious rituals.  Jennings makes the point that many or most of the Indians disliked this ritual as well, and did their best to simply avoid and ignore it.  This novel offers a sympathetic and insightful portrayal of The One World.  Whether it is accurate I cannot say.  But it is a vivid and engrossing setting and story.<br />The storyline is rather simple: it is about the life of one member of the Mexica nation (Aztecs) from his early youth to the arrival of Cortez and the conquest.  It is a wonderful, captivating, and sometimes moving story.  The novel does not dawdle--the storyline is brisk, the prose crisp.<br />My only criticism of the novel is that it is punctuated with soft and medium pornography throughout.  In this particular novel, this adds nothing.  Unfortunately, this is characteristic of most or all of Jennings' novels.  It ruined some of them.  Here it is only an annoyance--primarily because it causes me not to recommend the book to my children, which is a shame because otherwise this book would be a great way to introduce kids to another culture and civilization.<br />This is a novel well worth reading and keeping.	2002-11-09
US	46160224	R32D7O5QBM2OXH	0425039854	903744500	Trader To The Stars	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Wonderful science fiction.  Almost 5 stars.	This is a collection of short stories which take place in Poul Anderson's \\"Polesotechnic League\\" (\\"League of Selling Skills\\") aka Nicholas Van Rijn series.  The premise is simple: 1) Humans have achieved cheap interstellar travel; 2) There are many other intelligent races and inhabited planets; 3) Humans and aliens alike are just as greedy in the future as humans are now.<br />Unlike \\"Star Trek\\" (which I also love!) and some other science fiction prognostications about the future, this series never, ever, assumes that people (or aliens) are or will become morally superior to people in the present day.  There is no \\"Prime Directive\\" here. No, in Anderson's universe, most people are out to make a buck, and space is dominated by merchant-adventurers who make no bones about their aim of pursuing profit.  Anderson presents this as mostly a good thing, albeit not without its moral hazards.  The bad guys more often than not are politicians, whom Anderson more often than not, scorns.  The good guys (and gals) are merchant-adventurers who, in their pursuit of profit, encounter some pretty wild situations and get into some pretty interesting (sometimes quite funny) predicaments.<br />The stories in this collection are highly readable, well-written, and quite imaginative.  They always involve clever applications of scientific speculation combined with a good storyline.  The stories generally do a fine job of keeping the reader's interest.  They are crisply written and move along smartly, unlike some of Anderson's later writings (see my reviews of \\"Harvest of Stars\\" and \\"The Stars are also Fire\\" by Anderson--some of his later works.)<br />This book is highly recommended.  If you like this one, don't miss \\"The Trouble Twisters\\" which is the next book in the series, also a collection of short stories set in the Polesotechnic League future.  Enjoy both.	2002-11-09

John Smith has met the love of his life, and is probably on the verge of tying the knot with her.  His life is interrupted by a terrible auto accident that leaves him in a coma for 8 years.  When he comes out of the coma, his girl is married to someone else, and the world has moved on without him.  And when he awakes he has a powerful psychic ability to see the future, evidently triggered by the accident, and activated by touch.<br />John Smith tries to adapt to his new life and his new power.  The rest would be telling.  However, it is fair to say that the book moves at a pretty good pace, with a decent storyline and good prose.  This isn't one of those King novels that gets bogged down with far-out stuff--it is rooted essentially in reality except for Smith's psychic power.  Even that is presented in a pretty believable way, not wildly different from the documented ability of psychic Peter Hurkos.<br />This is my favorite King novel.  I found it to be believable, moving, and upsetting.  And a ripping good read.	2002-11-09
US	46160224	R3IFKDKJMMU2MI	0399118683	804552417	Mirkheim	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Very good science fiction.  Give it 4 and a half stars.	This novel takes place in the latter days of Poul Anderson's &quot;Polesotechnic League&quot; future history, which is part of the &quot;golden age&quot; of science fiction which began in the 1940s and extends perhaps into the late 1960s. (See my reviews of &quot;Trouble Twisters&quot; and &quot;Trader to the Stars&quot; for the basic premise of the series).<br />In Mirkheim, the Polesotechnic League is a sprawling civilization encompassing many worlds and intelligent races.  Unlike many other science fiction prognostications of the future, the Polesotechnic League is based on commerce--none of this &quot;Star Trek&quot; stuff about people not needing money and so on.  Here, people and aliens act pretty much like humans do today, and for the same reasons.  This means that while charitable and ethical motives exist, people and some aliens alike are out to make a buck (well, a credit).  Notwithstanding this similarity to present day humans, Anderson does manage to make his aliens different from humans, and he generally has a pretty good scientific basis for these differences.  His speculations along these lines are often quite interesting.<br />In this novel, the Polesotechnic League is faced with essentially a civil war between two rival factions, for mysterious reasons that the protagonists, Nicholas Van Rijn, David Falkayn and his &quot;Trouble Twister&quot; team, are trying to understand and overcome.  This is really a conflict between freedom and big government, and there is some typically Poul Anderson debate about the desireablity of big versus small government.  My only complaint about the novel is that it ends on something of a depressing note.<br />This is a &quot;must read&quot; for readers who have enjoyed other Poul Anderson stories set in the &quot;Polesotechnic League&quot; universe.  A very interesting and readable yarn.	2002-11-09

It presents the reader with a dazzling image of ancient Rome, in fact I literally felt transported back to the Rome of the time of Marius.  After reading all of McCullough's &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; books (those written as of this date) this one is still my favorite.  I've read a fair amount about Rome, but no book that I have read has ever explained Rome's politics and social structure half as well as this one.<br />Marius is shown as what he was: a giant.  I'm not sure that I'm comfortable with McCullough's portrayal of Sulla, but each reader can make that decision for him or her self.  This book covers the time period as from shortly before the Jugurthine War (which I never really understood until I read this book) to slightly after Marius' conquest of the German tribes.  But this isn't just a book about wars.  McCullough takes the readers into the Senate, into private conversations of Roman (and foreign) leaders, and really tries to get at the guts of what was going on in the Roman Republic at this critical stage of its history.  Mostly, she succeeds brilliantly.	2002-11-06
US	46160224	R2590NB9OS4MZ0	0380710854	540323986	Caesar: Let the Dice Fly  (Masters of Rome, Book 5)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Good but not great.	I like McCullough's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series very much, although it has its share of flaws. The worst thing about \\"Caesar\\" is my perception that McCullough has in effect fallen in love with Julius Caesar. She literally appears blind to the possibility that he had any flaws at all, except possibly ambition and lust (both of which she heartily approves of, it seems.) This irritating infatuation by McCullough of Caesar permeates all of her books in which Caesar plays a part.<br />This book is pretty good, in that it is readable and does a very good job of explaining something that I admit I never understood: why Caesar felt that he had to cross the Rubicon, \\"let the dice fly high\\" and essentially overthrow the Republic (although that was perhaps not his intent at the time.)<br />McCullough seems to pick her favorites among the figures of ancient Rome, and the non-historic parts of her novels quickly clue you in on who falls into the favored vs. disfavored camp. Caesar can do no wrong. On the other hand, Sulla is portrayed as a sick wife-abusing monster (read \\"Fortune's Favorites\\" and \\"First Man in Rome\\" and see if you don't agree), another figure picks up the nickname \\"piglet,\\" and Pompey is portrayed as well, pompus. By contrast, Caesar is portrayed virtually as a god-on-earth. A more detached view of history probably fails to bear these opinions out, but McCullough is anything but detached.<br />From a stylistic point of view, some parts of this novel move along smartly, with crisp clear prose, while other parts get bogged down badly. But if you can hang in there, this book will reward you with an interesting, if flawed, view of Caesar.<br />Just my opinion. There are doubtless a million others.	2002-11-06

The thing that made the original &quot;Dune&quot; novel so great was its plausibility.  It imparted a sense of reality and wonder that translated into real authenticity.  The characters seemed like real people living on real planets in the far distant future.<br />This book fails to do any of that.  Having read all of the previous Dune books, I had lots of questions about, and notions about, what the &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; had comprised.  When I read this book my reaction was &quot;you have got to be kidding.&quot;<br />I thought the other three Dune novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson were pretty worthy prequels.  &quot;The Butlerian Jihad,&quot; by contrast, misses the mark completely.  I rarely give only one star to a book that I have actually finished, but this one will be an exception.  Save your money.<br />The authors can do better and should have known better.  I don't know how they managed to produce this turkey.	2002-11-06

It is every bit as bad as &quot;Red Mars&quot; and that's saying something.  The book essentially involves political quibbling several hundred years in the future about issues that defy both relevance or real comprehension.

This novel fails to impart &quot;that sense of wonder&quot; that I look for in a science fiction novel.  Additionally, the writing is poor.  The author always manages to tell in three pages what three sentences might do as well.  The book is tedious.  The characters are not lifelike.  They do not behave like real people.  To be honest, I found the book to be a bore.  To ensure that I was being fair, I read this novel twice just to make certain that I wasn't missing something.  No change.<br />This novel, the first of an overlong &quot;Mars Trilogy&quot; deals with the initial colonization of Mars by an international group.  Unfortunately, the characters simply do not ring true.  There is little if any plot.<br />In addition to being poorly-written with bloated prose, &quot;Red Mars&quot; also features a massive dose of Political Correctness.  All forceful, dominant characters are women.  Men do as they are told.  Must have been something in the Martion air?  I am all for equality, but people just don't act like the characters in this book.  You can have equality without the characters seeming unreal.<br />I honestly don't know what the fuss was about as regards this novel.  I thought it was barely good enough to finish.<br />As I have said elsewhere, someone still needs to write a **good** and realistic novel about man's colonization of Mars.  This book is a clean miss.	2002-11-05

Dominick Flandry is a 30th Century Horatio Hornblower.  This is space opera, plain and simple.  But it is very very high quality and readable space opera, and Poul Anderson really does put some effort into speculating about what human society will evolve into, and what alien races will be like.  These stories are entertainment.  Flandry is extremely likable, and so are the Merseians, the alien bad guys. (They are more or less a cross between the Klingons (whom they predate) and an iguana.)<br />These short stories are meant to be fun and are that.  This is not deep meaningful literature.

This is one of the best science fiction novels written since the 1950s. The premise is brutally simple, and utterly plausible.  The time is the near future.  Earth has been conquered by an alien race that immediately relegates human beings to the status of owned &quot;cattle.&quot;  At first all hope is lost.  Humans have no rights, no aspirations, and the superiority of the alien &quot;Aalaag&quot; invaders is overwhelming.<br />Eventually a human underground takes root.  But it happens in a way that will surprise the reader because it completely avoids the ordinary banality of the usual &quot;underground resistance&quot; type of novel.  The ending will startle and surprise.<br />Dickson's prose is excellent, at times he is poetic and moving.  This novel probably features some of Dickson's best writing.<br />I suppose the thing I liked best about this novel is that it imparts to the reader a sense of both plausibility and wonder to which all good SF aspires, but that only the best attains.  This book reads like something that could happen.  There is nothing about this story that involves the need for any suspension of the reader's critical facilities.  The aliens in this novel seem real.  They don't do anything to humans that humans don't do to other, apparently inferior (by human standards) species.  It makes you think.<br />This novel is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who enjoys good science fiction, or would like to.	2002-11-05

This is the story of the human race as it exists about a billion years in the future.  A more ambitious premise for a novel is almost impossible to imagine, but Clarke pulls it off brilliantly.  This is an incredibly imaginative work, and before it is over it offers a sweeping vision of human destiny.  And all the while it does so by telling a good story too!  This is a novel, not a work of philosphy.<br />This is the story of Alvin, the first child to be born in over a million years in the great city of Diaspar, man's greatest and last city.  But Alvin is different than his peers, because he alone in all of Diaspar is not pathologically afraid of the notion of leaving Diaspar, or of venturing into outer space.  And thus Alvin's explorations, and the novel's story, begin.  A great yarn with a startling and inspiring ending.	2002-11-04

Clarke's imagination here is staggering.<br />The novel takes place several thousand years from now.  Earth has been destroyed by an unstable sun.  Mankind foresaw the nova of Earth's sun for about two thousand years, and mounted an effort to colonize nearby stars in order to save the species.  This was done in the nick of time.<br />The story takes place on planet Thalassa--a world largely of oceans with a single pair of islands perhaps the size of Taiwan.  The Thalassans, originally colonists from Earth, have been alone for over a thousand years.  Now they are visited by the last starship from Earth, which stops there en route to a different planet intended for colonization.<br />The story deals with the clash of cultures, but the best part are the flashbacks to Earth, and Clarke's highly intelligent and plausible extrapolations as regards science, politics, and societal development.  Clarke's prose is outstanding as well, which is not all that common in science fiction.  This is, quite simply, a wonderful story which will strike a chord in most readers.	2002-11-04

Michael Crichton is a polymath--one who is apparently able to master many fields of knowledge.  In this book, Crichton successfully writes a plausible story of time travel--into medieval France.  Crichton's imagination, knowledge of history and knowledge of science makes this believable and realistic.  Most time travel stories fail in both regards.  This one does not.<br />Crichton's explanation of quantum theory and how it might relate to time travel is utterly fascinating.  His preface to the novel puts the notion of time travel in perspective, by comparing this possibility with already-present and wondrous 20th Century technological achievements.  Don't skip this part.<br />The story itself is interesting, but it does get bogged down in the middle and latter portions.  I found the ending to be unsatisfying, although I don't know what Crichton could have done to improve it.  Once one believes time travel is possible, it's pretty tough to explain where this leaves everything.<br />This novel convinces the reader that mankind has, already, walked far.  And that there is no reason to believe that we are not just beginning to be on our way.	2002-11-04

The novel begins in prehistoric, ice age England and continues through the present day, as seen through the eyes of a number of English bloodlines.  An ambitious project such as this is bound to have flaws, and this is not a perfect book.  But it is an outstanding book, and truly gives the reader a \\"feel\\" for England and its history.<br />Some parts of the book are easy reads, and some aren't.  The best parts are the parts dealing with stone age England, the Black Death era, Roman era England, and the times around the American Revolution.  Some of the intervals in between the foregoing get pretty bogged down, and are tough sledding.  But this is a book that is worth reading, worth finishing, and worth reading again.<br />Oddly, the book largely ignores the Napoleonic War era, one of Britain's most heroic times.  It also does not dwell much on the British Empire at its height.  It spends more time on histories of old English cathedrals than most of us care about.  But what the heck, with a subject as ambitious as this one, criticism is inevitable.<br />This book will not disappoint, but it does require effort.	2002-11-04

Basically, this book is intended to push a Politically Correct point of view.  It does so relentlessly, to the point that the so-called \\"plot\\" (I am charitably assuming that there is one) is submerged between various \\"PC\\" diatribes.  Essentially, Truscott is out to trash anyone who opposes gays in the military, women in the front lines of infantry units, etc.  Everyone who holds traditional or conservative views as regards the foregoing is a mindless ogre, and that is what the book is about.<br />Essentially, the book is dishonest.  The real Army is nothing like the way Truscott portrays it, and Truscott knows it.  I didn't attend West Point, but we may safely assume that Truscott's portrayal of West Point is equally dishonest.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I could have handled the \\"PC\\" point of view of the author if there were an interesting story buried in here.  There is not.  Truscott has no time to tell a story about anything.  He is only interested in pushing his Leftist politics at you.<br />Truscott's book \\"Dress Grey\\" to which this is a sequel was a decent if not brilliant read.  All of Truscott's books since then are ghastly and militant diatribes pushing Truscott's PC agenda at the expense of plot, realism, or truth.  Avoid this novel and this author.	2002-11-04

It is, of course, a prequel to Dune, the Frank Herbert Sr. classic.  Although it is not as great a book as the original Dune, I actually liked it better than all of the sequels to Dune written by the original Frank Herbert Sr.<br />The novel takes place in the latter years of the Old Duke's reign on Caladan, the home of House Atreides.  It introduces us to the Old Duke, and to Duke Leto Atreides, who we never really get to know in the original Dune, since he gets killed off there fairly soon.  Duke Leto is the central character of this novel, and that fact is what makes this a pleasure to read.<br />The story is fast-paced, interesting, and very readable.  It was good enough that I have re-read it, and I enjoyed it very much the second time.  Recommended.	2002-11-04

What would be the effect on our modern society if it became clear that \\"Human 3.0\\" was arriving? That is the basic premise of this novel.<br />The last book I read that examined the subject of human evolution in a modern context was A.E.

Nevertheless, the novel's fascinating premise, intelligent scientific speculation, and gritty realism more than makes up for these shortcomings.<br />There seemed to be some Political Correctness going here, by the way. The women characters are all masterful, and the men are all subordinate. Whatever.<br />My main criticism of this book is that it ended at the most interesting part: the coming of \\"Human 3.0.\\" What now?

The book at first seems to end its speculation there, but there is far more to come.  My only criticism is that Clarke's vision of our future is not uplifting, and is frankly somewhat depressing.  Paradoxically, this does not take away from the quality of the novel.  While many books are called &quot;classics,&quot; this novel really is one.<br />This is a classic novel of intelligent speculation that belongs in every science fiction afficianado's library.	2002-11-03

US	46160224	R1JV1350ZHDDOG	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Outstanding--well-written and makes you think.	This is possibly Heinlein's biggest novel, prolific though he was.  The story is heavily influenced by World War II politics, but is not bad for all that.<br />The basic premises of the book are that: 1) the science of governance is an exact science; 2) interstellar travel exists and the colonization of the galaxy by humans has commenced; and 3) Earth is at war with very hostile and very alien Aliens (the \\"arachnids).  The first premise is most important.  In the novel only persons who have served a term in the armed forces are permitted to vote (such persons are called \\"citizens\\"--everyone else is a \\"lawful resident\\").  This has led to a society in which \\"laws are few and the standard of living is about as high as productivity permits.\\"  Many modern-day liberals have called this book \\"fascist\\" for advocating this qualification for voting.  Untrue.  Heinlein makes an interesting case, and his future society features freedom of speech and other basic rights.  And no draft.<br />The novel is well-written, although some may not like Heinlein's tendency to preach his political point of view.  Remember that this novel won the Hugo Award in 1959 for good reason: the book is a darned good read.<br />This book is almost 5 stars.  Read it and keep it.	2002-11-03

US	46160224	R2K9SRLWCKIARE	0345336941	616884404	Neutron Star	Books	4	19	23	N	Y	Excellent Science Fiction short stories.  Almost 5 stars.	Larry Niven is a major science fiction author, and probably the leading name to emerge in the 1970s.  Neutron Star is a collection of his well-known \\"Known Space\\" short stories.  The stories are interesting, feature pretty good prose, and a dazzling and optimistic vision of the future.<br />My main criticism of this collection is that one or two stories drag a bit, primarily \\"The Soft Weapon.\\"  However, overall this is a wonderful collection.  The short story \\"Neutron Star\\" which won a Hugo, is simply outstanding.<br />The quality of Niven's writing deteriorates almost linearly as functions of two variables: 1) time; and 2) the length of the story.  Most of his novels tend to be tedious, and novels seem to highlight Niven's weaknesses as a writer: poor character development and characters who don't act like real people.  Niven hasn't written anything worth reading in many years, in my opinion.  It is almost as though he forgot how to write.<br />On the other hand, Neutron Star, one of Niven's early works, lacks the foregoing deficiencies and mainly highlight's Niven's strengths: a vivid vision of the future, and skillful use of science and speculation.	2002-11-03

It is not. It is irritatingly flawed in a number of ways that greatly detract from the book, in my opinion at least.<br /><br />Firstly, the \\"Empire of Man\\" is essentially, from a political standpoint, a cross between the British Empire at its zenith, and the Roman Empire. The \\"Navy\\" is EXACTLY like the British Navy with spaceships instead of sailing ships. Overall, the Empire is one-dimensional and not at all plausible.<br /><br />Secondly, the aliens. They are implausible. Yes, the notion of a very old species with specialized sub-species is interesting. But not these aliens. Niven/Pournelle postulate rat-like aliens (the Moties) who can instinctively invent high-technology gizmos without standard sized parts, written plans, etc. Sounds like an invention by someone who never built anything, i.e. the authors.<br /><br />The one interesting alien was the Mediator class. This notion, of Mediators working subordinate to the Masters, was creative and interesting. Probably the sole original idea in the book.<br /><br />The character development in this novel is poor. Captain Rod Blaine is one-dimensional and uninteresting, as is Sally Fowler and most other characters. Excepting Kevin Renner, none of the characters act like real people.<br /><br />The politics of the Empire are simply asinine. Mankind is not going to combine a British-style monarchy with high-technology and interstellar travel. The authors couldn't even be bothered to invent new titles for the aristocrats. Nope, they lifted them verbatim from Great Britain. Even the British don't really have aristocrats these days, but in this book, here they are. Unconvincing.<br /><br />Despite these faults, this book is a better-than-passable read. A great book it ain't. RJB.	2002-11-03

This is a wonderful novel, and my favorite Ian Fleming yarn.  James Bond is dispatched to Japan on a diplomatic mission.  He develops a strong friendship and bond with &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka, the head of the Japanese Secret Service.  The Japanese have something Great Britain desperately needs.  James Bond must undertake a very tough mission in order to get it.<br />The story is crisply written and at times is almost poetic.  The reader comes to know and like &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka.  The storly moves along smartly, with an ending that will surprise and perhaps delight.  A classic.	2002-10-30
US	46160224	R1XWA7AE9UTXD6	0812519469	634425056	Harvest of Stars	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A dark novel.  Good, but not Anderson's best work.	As I have noted elsewhere, as he got older Poul Anderson seemed to more or less settle on his vision of man's future.  He essentially appears to believe that man is destined to be subordinate to and dominated by entities of artificial intelligence, which will simultaneously raise the general standard of living while diminishing mankind's self-determination.  Anderson portrays this as an inevitable and a depressing future.  There is no better friend to freedom and liberty than Anderson, yet he seems to lack confidence that mankind in the future will enjoy freedom in a manner consistent with American notions. A plausible and interesting concept, but in his last decade or so Anderson seemed unable to depart from this groove.  Surely other human destinies are possible--Anderson has told of many.<br />Poul Anderson is far and away my favorite SF author.  This novel, while interesting and readable, is not his best work.  This book is a maddening mix of brilliant speculation, great characterization, and bloated prose.  This novel would have been twice as good if it had been half as long.<br />The novel is the story of a freedom-loving spacefaring &quot;corporation&quot; (really a nation of sorts) struggling against oppressive earth governments.  The relevant characters are brilliantly portrayed as people and as idealists, and/or villains.  Unfortunately, the book bogs down and could and should have been much more crisply written.  Consequently, the story line seems to ramble towards the end.  Frankly, I found the ending unsatisfying and implausible.<br />Poul Anderson's other works are more imaginative and better written.  If you like this book (and there is a fair amount to like) try his Nicholas Van Rijn/Polesotechnic League series, and his many collections of short stories.  This are among his best work.	2002-10-28
US	46160224	R2GXEM6MLZWSGL	055356241X	807397831	Mars	Books	3	18	25	N	N	A depressing story of man's first trip to Mars.	The one good thing about this book is that if you completely ignore the politics (impossible in this book!) the story of how man might put together an expedition to Mars is actually fairly plausible.<br />Unfortunately, the book is overrun by politics.  Evidently this novel was written just before the old Soviet Union fell apart, because it postulates that the Soviets dominate the international consortium due to their superior science, dynamic economy, and experience in space.  The novel even has a throwback to the early Space Race days when a Russian explains that Russia pulled itself up to modernity in one generation and gave billions in foreign aid to the Third World.  God only knows where Bova has been during the 90s.  Oh, I almost forgot.  A gaggle of South Americans are the &quot;soul of the Mars project.&quot;  Sure--South America is constantly forging ahead into outer space.  Bova's depiction of 21st Century America is utterly depressing.  If that is the way things are going, I might emigrate to Mars myself.<br />Putting this aside, the book is tolerable.  The technical concepts behind the Mars expedition as postulated by Bova are well thought-out and plausible, and the characters, excepting the Russians, aren't badly done.  In fact they are quite well done by Bova's standards.  Several of them are near sociopaths though, and one wonders if psychologists are really sufficiently incompetent to select people like this for the trip.  NASA mostly seems to avoid these problems, but then again most US astronauts seem to be Midwestern farming types.  Maybe a disparate group of Russians, Americans, Chinese, Indians, South Americans, and Europeans would be as dysfunctional as Bova predicts.<br />The book is worth a read, but isn't one that most people will want to keep on their bookshelves for a repeat.  Someone still needs to write a **really good** novel about man going to Mars.  Or maybe we just need to do it for real.	2002-10-28
US	46160224	R1RPE0JPRDZLGZ	0380797259	700939540	Return to Mars	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Mediocre.	This is the sequel to Bova's \\"Mars\\" novel, which was a more-than-tolerable read. This novel was barely worth finishing. Essentially, Bova is plumping against the notion that those awful Earth capitalists might exploit Mars by wanting to go there. The politics in the first novel were asinine, in this one just plain wierd. Somehow Bova has an American Indian tribe claiming the rights to most of Mars, thereby keeping the great unwashed capitalist masses away from Mars. Yeah, like that's going to happen.<br /><br />Bova's Left-wing political slant is worse in this novel than it was in \\"Mars.\\" It gets worse, by the way, in \\"Venus\\" which I was unable to finish, and therefore have not reviewed.<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars because I was able to finish it. Not recommended though. RJB.	2002-10-28

Winter is the story of a Berlin family and traces their lives through two world wars and the periods in between.  I have never read a novel that did a better job of helping me understand how it might have felt to be a German during those times.  Or any time.  The characters are vividly portrayed, and the story line is facinating.  This is my favorite Len Deighton book, although SS-GB is a close second.<br />This is a book you'll read more than once.  I have made it a permanent part of my library.	2002-10-25

SS-GB deals with life in Nazi-occupied Great Britain, about one year after the German Army successfully overruns the British Isles.  I found it to be utterly believable, completely convincing.  Churchill has been secretly executed by a German firing squad, and the King is imprisoned in the Tower of London under special SS guard.  America considers the war to be over.  And therein lies the tale.  The end will rock you and sock you.<br />The book deals with one Detective Archer, a detective with Scotland Yard, which is itself under the command of a German police General.  There is a murder to be solved, and as one might guess, there is more to the murder than meets the eye.  Archer must solve the murder and deal with the political rivalries that affect his German masters.<br />Deighton's novel captures the sense of defeat--the dark, moody time (which in real life was only just barely averted) after the all hope is lost and the British have suffered utter defeat.  But life goes on, and this is what SS-GB is really about.  There is a story here, about seemingly real people, and Deighton tells it.  This is a book that I have made a permanent part of my library, and I re-read it every couple of years.  It is that kind of book.	2002-10-25
US	46160224	R3MOQDLHWRNV33	0812530225	992410434	The Stars Are Also Fire (Harvest of Stars)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good, but not Anderson's best	This book was twice as long as it needed to be.  As he got older, Poul Anderson seemed to need more words to say less.  This book is like that.  Still a good book for those who like science fiction and who like to think.<br />Late in his career, Anderson seemed to conclude that it is inevitable that eventually humans would become subordinate to man-made creations of artificial intelligence.  Many of his books lead to this common conclusion.  Anderson plainly views this as depressing, which makes this book a dark and unhappy vision of humanity's destiny.  He may be right, but he seemed to be stuck in this groove and unable to think outside of this particular box, at least towards the end.<br />This book epitomizes another Anderson staple: distrust of government.  It compares feudal society (the Lunarians) with the ultimate State (the machine-dominated Earth government or, alternatively, the Avantist government that supplants America's present republican form of government.).<br />Despite the above, this book is worth reading, especially if (like me) you are a big Poul Anderson fan.  This book is entertaining and imaginative, and worth more than just a look.	2002-10-21
US	46160224	R1GRWEFWLMINZM	0425058220	951437734	Trouble Twisters	Books	5	6	6	N	N	An overlooked classic	This is the first book in an overlooked \\"future history\\" series by author Poul Anderson.  Essentially, it postulates: 1) mankind develops cheap interstellar travel within a few centuries; 2) there are quite a few worlds inhabited with sentient beings; and 3) humans and aliens are just as greedy in the future as humans are right now here on earth.  Anderson takes these three postulates and projects what I have found to be the most plausible extrapolation about what an interstellar human civilization would be like that I have yet found.<br />Those familiar with the broad range of Anderson's work know that he believes that the market \\"functions as effortlessly and as inevitably as gravity.\\"  The Trouble Twisters deals with interstellar merchant-adventurers out to make a buck.  No \\"Prime Directive\\" here.  Human civilization is dominated by the Polesotechnic League (\\"League of Selling Skills\\") and is unabashadly capitalist.  Private corporations and merchant-adventurers dominate space travel for the very good reason that they plan to make a profit by it. (Something to think about in itself.  NASA hasn't gone to the moon lately.)<br />Anderson's characters are well-developed, and the stories will make you think and make you laugh about the predicaments people (and aliens) manage to get themselves into.  Recommended.	2002-10-21

This book is a worthy addition to the alternate history introduced in \\"The Caves of Steel\\" and \\"The Naked Sun.\\"  Asimov postulates that mankind has established successful interstellar colonies (the \\"Outer Worlds\\"), but that these colonies have turned hostile to the home world of Earth.  Aurora, the most powerful of the Outer Worlds, has experienced a murder, of a sort, and seeks the services of Elijah Baley, a detective of Earth.  The notion is plausible: Earth is overcrowded and used to dealing with police work, while crime is virtually unknown on the Outer Worlds.  Baley's reputation is already known to Aurora by his accomplishments in the earlier novels.<br />We quickly learn that the real issues deal with matters infinitely more profound than a single murder. The Outer Worlds are debating the future colonization of the galaxy, and the role, if any, of Earth.  The novel does a good job of showing the importance of this issue, and tying the matter of the \\"murder\\" and Baley's success or failure, to it.  The end is startling.<br />The writing is a little more wordy than Asimov's earlier novels, and Asimov's age shows a little--as illustrated by two and three page descriptions of Outer World lavatories which are present in several portions of the novel, for what reason I cannot imagine.  Nevertheless, setting these quirks aside (they are quirks) the novel is a good read for anyone interested in Asimov's Robot novels, and further, it ties the Robot novels to the Foundation series \\"future history.\\"  Hard not to like a book that can do all that!	2002-10-21
US	46160224	RJ6CL6W7DG194	0517625911	714221261	Word of Honor	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Magnificent, beautifully written, hard-hitting	This is quite simply the best novel I can ever recall reading. It is the story of Benjamin J. Tyson, a former Army combat lieutenant and Vietnam veteran. By a series of odd, but plausible and believable events, the conduct of Tyson's platoon in the battle of Hue, in Vietnam, is scrutinized by the Army and the nation twenty years later. This is not a book about the Vietnam War per se. It is the story of how one group of men, and one extraordinary man, handled an intolerable combat situation, and how the country might have responded to these actions once exposed. It is also a pretty realistic analysis of military law.  The segment of the book that deals with the court martial is, quite simply, wonderful.<br /><br />The characters in this novel are realistic and vibrant.  Benjamin J. Tyson is unforgettable.  Many of the other characters are vivid and memorable.  Demille is profound, funny, serious, and insightful. Demille at his best is better than anyone, and this is Demille's best novel, even exceeding The Charm School.<br />The story picks up momentum gradually, but the reader will be rewarded if he or she \\"hangs in there.\\" And really, it is pretty easy to stay interested even at the rather nondescript beginning of the novel. This book is a great read.<br /><br />The only reason I can imagine that this incredible book was not made into a major motion picture is the overall public disaffection with the Vietnam War. This is a mistake. At a time when comic book stories are being made into high-budget movies, this book cries out for attention! And yet this book is not primarily about the Vietnam War--it is about how men react to combat and how Tyson and the country deal with an apparent scandal.  Although the book does not try to \\"reform\\" the general notion that a lot went wrong with America's involvement in Vietnam, this is no anti-war book either.  The novel rings true to any number of political events that have actually occurred.<br /><br />Read this book. Keep it and re-read it time and again. It is that type of novel.ad it time and again. It is that type of novel.	2002-10-20
