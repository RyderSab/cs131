US	52454113	R86WCKOUYP1OC	0679426159	668262969	Standing in the Rainbow: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Sentimental Slice of Life	My rating is really about a 3.75<br />This was an enjoyable if somewhat sentimental view of small town life. Centered around the friends and family of Dorothy Smith, who is a 'radio homemaker' broadcasting her show Neighbor Dorothy from her living room, from 1936-1974.<br />The book itself has no real major plot line, but is instead a series of vignettes of small town life, loosely linked together by the interaction with Neighbor Dorothy, or her reporting of news about the characters on her show.<br />Although enjoyable I did have a few complaints. One is that Ms. Flagg writes some wonderful characters that we get very attached to, and then suddenly never hear much about again. One feels there are a wealth of interesting stories left untold. I would be interested in learning more about Beatrice, the little blind song bird, and her life with the Oatman Family Gospel Singers. There are a number of characters like this, and I found that a bit frustrating.<br />One other thing that bothered me was some historical inaccuracy here and there. These things always bug me, and although they did not alter the story, it was always in the back of my mind.<br />All in all a light and fun read, particularly if you enjoyed Welcome to the World Baby Girl, where the folks of Elmwood Springs also appear.	2002-10-13

It wasn't the use of some archaic language that made it so hard, but the heartbreaking storyline. This book is based on the true story of the villagers of Eyam, who chose to quarantine themselves from the surrounding villages in order to stop the plague that had invaded their lives from spreading. We see the entire story through the eyes of Anna Firth. We meet Anna after her husband has died in a mining accident, and she is raising two young children alone. Anna takes in a boarder to help with her expenses, laying the groundwork for tragedy, because her boarder is a tailor. One day a bolt of cloth comes from London, bearing the seeds of plague.<br />The year is 1666, and Anna will begin the most extraordinary year of her life, as she becomes a healer and a heroine. She will face the loss of almost everything she loves, and almost loses her own sanity during the year of the plague.<br />Despite the many horrors of the plague depicted in the book, there are also tiny moments of joy buried beneath the pain, and this is a book you will not soon forget.<br />As with most of the other reviews, my main complaint is the last chapter of the book, the Epilogue. It seemed a very jarring and rather disappointing ending to a wonderful book. However don't let that stop you from reading this book, because if you do, you will miss a beautifully written story, with a truly inspirational heroine.	2002-10-12

Goldy, the main character is not perfect. A little over weight, a bad marriage behind her, an absent minded mother at times. Some how in her catering business, she seems to always stumble into crime.<br />Although the mystery in this book seems quite implausible, in particular the method of murder, watching Goldy solve the crime is part of the fun of the book. However the best part of the book is the description of food, and the tantalizing recipes scattered through out the book. I really am going to have to cook one of these dishes sometime soon.<br />The main storyline involves the death of Goldy's new boyfriend Phillip Miller. His death is called an accident, but Goldy doesn't believe that. Temporarily relocated to a wealthy part of town, and living as an in house cook to a rather eccentric family, Goldy determines to find out who killed Phillip. The only problem is, her real life such as catering parties and dealing with a pre-teen son keep intruding on her crime solving plans.<br />Entertaining, funny and easy to read, this is a good addition to the series.	2002-08-31
US	52454113	R13JK9XBXCTX8U	B00006F7IV	884489587	Welcome to My Planet	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Cute but Confusing	This is another entry in the Bridget Jones style of books, and in my opinion, just average. Single woman approaching thirty and still looking for love and a life. Some very funny and sharply written scenes are bogged down by the constant jumping around in time. There are whole chapters where I was not sure when they were supposed to occur. I liked Shanny Olson (same name as the author) but sometimes wondered what her problem was. She came from a good family, was attending graduate school, had a job and a boyfriend who loved her. Yet she whines a lot and seems unable to get out of bed, relying on Prozac to get her through her days. Maybe having been a single mother struggling to raise a child and pay the blls at thirty, I had a tough time identifying with her. An okay, fast read, but this type of book has been done better.	2002-08-25

Tempe Brennan was a welcome change from Kay Scarpetta, a strong, well written character and warmer character, with lots of potential for growth in character and her relationships. Unfortunately that doesn't happen here. Although the forensics were interesting, there were long boring sections of lectures masquerading as conversations, particularly the 9 pages of blood splatter theory. This is a bit of overkill for the average reader like myself. I also found the motorcycle gang storyline quite confusing with names thrown out and no characters to attach them to. Tempe's character appears to be changing too. She makes one incredibly stupid decision to go to a biker bar in the middle of the night, that served as nothing more than a way to bring a character who had been absent throughout most of the book back into the storyline however briefly. And the identity of the person in her office who may be an informant is so blatant and obvious, when she finally catches on, you wonder what took her so long. Brennan is also beginning to whine a bit, in the Scarpetta mode, with everyone she works with seeming to be against her or unwilling to work with her. It is also very strange that everyone in her family seems to draw crime to them like a magnet. One of the most boring parts of the book were conversations between characters that were word for word restatments of information already relayed to the reader.  Here's hoping that Fatal Voyage is better, since I had already purchased it, or the title may become a self fulfilling prophecy for me and Tempe Brennan.	2002-08-16

While wandering Sussex Downs one day, she literally stumbles over a prone figure in the grass. This person turns out to be none other than the great Sherlock Holmes, and so begins a new friendship and the eventual partnership of a crime solving team of sleuths.<br />In the prologue we learn that the book is a rememberance of Mary Russell's manuscripts, written at the age of 90. Mary is surprised to learn that Sherlock Holmes is perceived to be a fictional character, yet she knew him as a living man.<br />She tells the story of meeting Sherlock, their unusal friendship, and his tutelage of Mary in the fine art of observation and solving puzzles. Eventually when Holmes is called in on a kidnapping case, Mary accompanies him, and helps solve the crime. Within a few months they are being stalked by a ruthless killer, who seems intent on ending their partnership by ending their lives.<br />Having been a Holmes fan for many years, I was pleased to find a book that didn't alter the total character of Holmes, but just added more dimension to him. I throughly enjoyed this book, and look forward to many more.	2002-08-11

To each his own, but I found this book breathtakingly beautiful. Since so many stories of young girls being abducted have been in the news of late, the book is also very timely.<br /><br />The book begins with the death of Susie Salmon (like the fish, as she would say). So begins the story of a family torn apart by her disappearnce, and the ultimate acceptance of her death. Through Susie's eyes we learn of what her experience in heaven is like, and her close bonds with those she has left behind on earth. We watch the mystery of her death unfold, the changes in her friends and family and see it all through Suzie's forever 14 eyes. I stayed up all night unable to stop turning the pages.<br /><br />A unique and ultimately uplifting story, I recommend this book very highly.	2002-08-11

While catering a funeral, Goldy's ex father in law is poisoned, and Goldy's business is shut down.

Having read all the books I packed, I went to the hotel lobby store to pick up something quick and easy. I found Arkansas Traveler, and it sounded like the perfect book for vacation. What I didn't know is that the book was part of a series. I settled down to read and became quickly enraptured with Benni, her lovable and quirky friends and family. Unfortunately for me, now I will need to start the series at the beginning!<br />The mystery almost seems like a side event to the cooking, visiting, church going and interaction among all the family and friends presented here. I love 'Southern' flavored books, and this one does not disappoint. Lots of local color and eccentric people to keep one entertained. There is a murder, of someone it appears nobody liked. Toby Hunter is a wanna be white supremacist, and the son of Sugartree's mayor. When Toby is found dead, and the suspicion seems to be aimed at Benni's friend Amen's nephew, Benni decides to investigate. The final revelation of the murderer and the motives seem almost a sideline to everything else. The issure of race in the South is shown from both sides, and no simple and satisfactory conclusion is given to the complex questions raised, and for that I am thankful. I loved the writing, and the reverence for both small town life, and places like the Dairy Queen and Piggly Wiggly, and the love of good cooking. I cannot wait to start this series from book one!	2002-07-27

Although there are some points to complain about, overall this was a fast, suspenseful and enjoyable read.<br />Sarah Stevens is a butler/bodyguard to a wealthy retired judge. When she thwarts a robbery she is featured on a news program. And so the stalking of Sarah begins. In the interim Sarah has begun a romance with the police officer who investigated the burglary. A lot of twists and turns occur after Sarah's employer is murdered, and she becomes the prime suspect.<br />My complaints are minor. I didn't like Cahill, the love interest, as much as I liked Sarah, and thought they were not a great couple. I also had problems with the stalker. I think he was presented as far to 'bland' to have hatched his diabolical scheme. Still the point of these type of books is not to think too much, just have fun. I had fun, the book was an easy and fast read, and I look forward to more by Ms. Howard.	2002-07-27

Determined to find out who killed Andy, and why his reputation is being destroyed by innuendo and gossip, Joanna sets out to solve the mystery of his death on her own.<br />The pace of the book is fairly fast, and there are an assortment of interesting characters throughout the story. Joanna Brady is also smart, and tough, but with a touch of vulnerability. The setting of the Arizona desert is almost a character in the book, with nice descriptions. The ending leaves you wanting to follow up on the further adventures of Joanna Brady and company.	2002-06-18

So when Cane River was chosen as a group read for my reading group, I was very reluctant to read it. I could not have been more wrong. A beautifully written family saga, Cane River was one of the best books I have read in recent years. Putting one strongly in mind of the book  Roots by Alex Haley, this book is a novelization of the family history of Lalita Tademy. Told through the eyes of four women, all born into slavery, it shows the strength and courage of people who survive through the frequent upheavals thrust upon them.<br />We are introduced to the matriarch of the family Elisabeth, a slave from Virginia sold into a new plantation and taken from her husband and children. Here begins the story of the Cane River women, Suzette, Philomene and Emily. I was compelled to read every detail of their lives from slavery to freedom. I shared their heartbreak, joy, suffering and triumph, on the journey to freedom. The book paints a long lasting impression of the power of love and family. A book I will think of for a long time to come. I highly recommend you read this unforgettable book.	2002-06-18

They are usually good, fast page turners which don't require much thought. The same can be said about the latest book, Daddy's Little Girl. In a change of pace for Clark, the book is written in the first person, and I enjoyed this point of view, it made me feel more a part of the story.<br />The storyline has echoes of the current Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel trial.  Rich playboy from well to do family is accused of murdering younger neighborhood girl.  However in MHC's version, the young man goes to jail. We enter the story 23 years later, when the younger siter of the murder victim tries to prevent the murderer from getting his parole.<br />Ellie Cavanugh is a 30 year old investigative reporter, who is still coming to terms with the murder of her older sister. When Rob Westerfield is granted parole for the murder, he announces his intention to clear his name and get a new trial. Ellie is equally determined to prove him guilty beyond any doubt. Ellie is a nice change of pace character. Not written in the typical 'female in distress' mode, she had brains and enough sense not to go into dark rooms in the middle of the night, while we silently say don't go, don't do it. She is not written as a complete idiot, who needs to be rescued by a man.<br />Mild spoiler ahead if you haven't read the book stop now.<br />My biggest problem with the book, is that there were no real surprises. Everything was well plotted but there were no major twists and turns, no big surprises. The 'red herring' clues never amounted to much, and so the ending, while very fast moving, didn't have much punch to it. The final chapter, one year later, wraps up all the loose ends in on nice package, and almost felt added on. I also would have enjoyed a more romantic storyline than the one we got with Ellie & Peter.<br />I still like my yearly vist with MHC, and will buy her book next spring, and probably as long as she writes them, I'll be reading them.as long as she writes them, I'll be reading them.	2002-05-18

The newest entry in the series is another fast paced thriller, but far less involving than his previous books. I am not sure if I am getting tired of Rhyme's domineering manner, or the relationship between Lincoln and Amelia, but some spark was missing from the book in regards to their relationship. On the other hand the introduction of the Chinese police officer Sonny Li was a great addition, and he virtually steals the book whenever his character is around.<br />The story of a group of illegal Chinese immigrants who are hunted down by the smuggler who brought them to this country was<br />very interesting, and I learned a lot about a subject I never gave much thought to. The villainous Ghost almost seems indestructible, however I figured out his identity long before the revelation in the book, so it was not much of a shock to me. There seemed to be far fewer of Deaver's trademark twists and turns here, and I never had that edge of my seat feeling until the last forty or so pages of the book. Overall a pretty good thriller, but those of us who love Deaver probably expect more, because he is so good at what he does. Still an average book from this author is much better than most books of this genre out there.	2002-05-12

Unfortunately murder comes visiting, and China, along with her friend,Roz, can't resist the scent of a crime.<br />While not a very difficult mystery, there was much to enjoy in this book. Sharply written characters, a tightly woven plot and lots of chemistry between China and her quirky friends. There were just enough red herrings to make you play along with solving the case, and the outcome was quite believable. I plan to visit with China Bayles again soon.	2002-04-20

The title of the book is a play on words involving what we see as the plain truth and what the Amish (Plain) people see as the truth. A fascinating look into the life of the Amish people, it is also a finely tuned psychological drama and a mystery too.

The characterization of Tempe is fleshed out a bit more in this book, as we learn more of her personal life. We meet her sister Harry, her daughter Katy is a bit more visible and Tempe looks to have a love interest. But the main draw is the forensics, and we get a lot of it in this book. Flies, pupua, beetles, bones, entrance and exit wounds, etc., etc., it is laid on in almost every chapter. Although the cult storyline is a little far fetched, I read this book in one sitting, longing to have all the connections tied up. Looking forward to the next case, Deadly Decisions.	2002-04-01

We lived not far from Brooklyn and while not as poor, shared many of the same problems. The book has always been a fond memory for me. This month it was chosen as a group read for my reading group. Although I rarely re read, I decided to see if the book was as good as my memory said it was. To my delight it was still as wonderful as I remembered. Only this time I had a bit more sympathy for the mother Katie, then I did the first time. Seeing the book through the eyes of a mother, I admired more of the qualities I saw as harsh those many years ago. Betty Smith writes with such detail, that one can see the streets of Williamsburg as seen through Francie's eyes. The Nolan's are a family that literally lives the American dream. They start the book in dire poverty, yet each generation accomplishing more than the one before. And they have the most important gift of all, the love and support of family. Today this would no doubt be labeled a dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic father, a mother leaving her children unattended, an aunt who is a little too free with her favors. Yet we love the Nolans, and root for them through thick and thin. Francie Nolan loved reading and the library above all else. I am now the grown up Francie, still trying to read every book in the library. I am glad I took the time to re read this one. Francie Nolan will be a part of me forever.	2002-03-18

Like Lincoln Rhymes, the lead character in this book is not a lovable guy. Art Potter is a hostage negotiator whose only goal is to get the hostage takers to surrender. When he is called in on a case where 8 deaf children and their teachers have been abducted, the choices he makes often seem cold blooded. Yet we are rooting for Potter to succeed in ending the stand-off.<br />Writing a book where most of the characters are deaf could not have been easy, but Deaver seems to be able to get into the psyche of a deaf group of young girls, and write great &quot;speaking&quot; parts them. We are very in tune with the girls, and most especially the teacher, Melanie, whose character undergoes a metamorphosis during the captivity.<br />Deaver is the master of the &quot;I didn't see that one coming&quot;, and he does that again here. Just when you think everything is over and done, he shoots you right back into the action.<br />My biggest complaint with this book was the ending, certain things seemed out of character. It seemed a little pat. Regardless of that, the book was well worth the roller coaster ride, and puts me in mind of another of Deaver's books. Read this one, and you'll be &quot;Praying for Sleep&quot;, for you are certain to be up all night, worried about those hostages.	2002-03-05

An Elizabeth I Mystery	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Interesting, but not a great mystery	I love books about Elizabeth I, King Henry and the whole Tudor period. I thought the premise of this book was interesting, and a different twist on both the mystery genre, and Elizabeth. For the most part the book was interesting, filled with bits and pieces of historical information. Where the story fell flat for me was the mystery. I found it boring. The protagonist wasn't ayone we get to know during the course of the book, and I like mysteries where there are some surprises and interesting twists. The villain was evil enough, but it was more like, oh  so that's the murderer.  No slap to the head saying Oh wow, that's the murderer, why didn't I see that coming!! And then you start to piece the clues together. I suppose that this is a cozy mystery, I like a little more suspense. The best parts of the book were the interactions of Elizabeth and her rather interesting mix of \\"friends\\". I did enjoy the end, when Elizabeth learns she is the Queen, though, it was a nice touch.	2002-03-01

Summer Island is the story of Nora Bridge, and her decision to leave her husband and children. The repercussions of that action are the basis for this book. Nora has become a radio personality, famous for her advice on love and family relationships. But her world come crumbling down when her past is revealed.<br />Kristin Hannah obviously loves the Pacific North West and her descriptions of the San Juan Islands is beautiful. She has a way of making you empathize with her characters even when you don't agree with what they are doing. Her depiction of the two Bridge daughters, Ruby and Caroline, and their very different reaction to their mother's betrayal rings true. I enjoyed the way she portrays sibling love in the two sister's, and the two Sloan brother's, whose lives are central to the Bridge family.<br />This book made me laugh, made me cry and made me think about my own family and their place in my life. I recommend it to all Kristin Hannah fans.	2002-02-21

Through 8 vignettes, we travel through the life of a Vermeer painting. From the present day owner, we travel back to meet various owners of this painting, and the affect this painting had on all of them. The stories set in Holland were especially beautifully written and among my favorites. I also greatly enjoyed the depiction of the inspiration for the painting.

When this book was chosen as a read by my book group, I was not happy, envisioning weeks of boring history. I could not have been further from the truth. This book took off for me from page one, and was a page turner, and up all night kind of read. I couldn't wait to learn how Joan of Ingleheim, the daughter of an English father and Saxon mother was able to rise to the highest post in the Catholic Church. Her story was fascinating, from her early deceptions, learning to read when women were not taught, to her decision to live her life as a man. There is something for everyone in the story, deception, treachery, love, redemption, religion, sin, Vikings,  the list is endless. I recommend this book to all who would like to learn about medieval Rome, it has obviously been very well researched, and taught me a lot about life in the ninth century. I understand Ms. Cross is researching a new book, I eagerly await its release.	2002-02-17

I found the premise of the story very interesting. Two families brought together by tragedy, who go their separate ways, and are drawn back together thirty years later. The Renwick family is well drawn. The emotionally uninvolved Augusta Renwick, matriarch to the three Renwick girls, Caroline, cool and sophisticated, Clea the happily married earth mother and Skye the alcoholic mess. The problems stem from the overwhelming tragedies that seem to permeate the entire storyline. From the opening chapter scene of impending murder, to the accidental death of a young man caused by a young girl, the doom and gloom dragged the tone of the whole book down. The formulistic love story between Caroline and Joe was very predictable. What does save the book is the chemistry of the three sisters, whose story is heart warming, and believable. We all want to believe that love and loyalty can be the answer to a lot of unhappiness, and in this particular instance that is true. I have one other Luanne Rice book on my never ending To Be Read pile, so I will give this author one more try at winning my loyalty.	2002-02-09

Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving. The book is a little dated, and the naivet&eacute; of Cassandra sometimes takes one by surprise, but don't let that stop you from reading this book, because you will miss a lovely story.	2002-01-21

An almost perfect book. Characters I cared for, a heroine to really root for, a love story, and a coming of age book for someone in her 30's. I loved Ava Marie the 35 year old so called spinister of Big Stone Gap. Her quirky assortment of friends, Iva Lou the bookmobile lady (and what reader can resist a book that features a Bookmobile?, Pearl the poor but smart girl that makes good, Tayloe that beautiful but not so smart girl that maybe doesn't.

The story of serial killer Junior Cain was very intense and involving. The way his life and those of the other characters were constantly bumping up against one another was very well done. The development of Junior's psychosis was well written and although dark, had quite a bit of humor in it. The character of Barty's mom, the saintly Agnes the Pie Lady was also well drawn, but I found myself constantly wondering about her life as a child, with her two brothers Edom and Jacob, a life often alluded to but never fully explained. I think that may be a whole other book.<br />Although the character of Barty was the other focus of the story, I found him to be a little too perfect in his acceptance of everything around him, as well as all the other 'good' characters in the book. The were just too good, despite all the pain and suffering they endured.<br />The book races along at a break neck pace, and bogs down quite a bit near the middle. Towards the end of the book it once again picks up, until the final denouement and rather rushed ending. The tying together of the mystical with the scientific falls a little flat, and 20 years are summed up in the last 25 pages.<br />Although I didn't enjoy the book as much as I wanted to, I did enjoy the way the book was written as well as the use of language.<br />I understand from many Koontz fans that this is not his best book, so I will give him another try.	2001-12-08

For the most part the book was very enjoyable. The book within a book format was very well done, and kept me turning the pages to get to the end. Unfortunately I had figured out the entire book long before I got to the last page. The outcome was fairly predictable, although not entirely disappointing. I had a love hate relationship with the Parker Evans character, but found the Noah Reed character too broadly drawn, and Maris just a little too perfect, and seemingly unaffected in being a pawn in two men's games. My major complaint about the book involved the fairly graphic sex scenes. I don't mind sex in books or movies, but these were graphic enough to make me uncomfortable just reading them. I most likely would have graded the book a little higher if not for this factor.	2001-11-11

The story of the adulterous affair of Charles Callahan and his long lost childhood love, Sian Richards captured my attention, but not my heart. While one does believe that these two are deeply attracted to each other, there was not a deeply felt feeling of consuming love, which is what they are supposed to have. The tale of the childhood love rang far truer for me than the adult love.  While we are given some idea of why Charles and Sian are attracted to one another, their respective spouses are not fully developed, and so there is very little understanding of why the two would sacrifice so much of their lives to an obsessive love affair. Ms. Shreve's writing manages to evoke sympathy for the lovers, and there is an overwhelming feeling of longing in the book, but the conclusion to the story is a jolt, and leaves one with an equally overwhelming feeling of sadness. If you want to read an outstanding Shreve book, start with The Weight of Water, or The Piolt's Wife, which in my opinion were far better books.	2001-10-12

Unfortunately for me I chose this one. It started off fairly interesting, with the story of the Ryan family, and their quiet life in rural Ireland during 1962. Along comes Patrick O'Neill, a wealthy Irish American with great plans for a hotel in the area, where his family once lived. The impact of this man, his plans, and his family's interaction with the families of the town was a promising story. Yet one tragedy after another, with no happy end in sight just dragged this book down. Over six hundred pages long, it was ultimately a very unsatisfying read.  I haven't given up on Binchy though, I have Circle of Friends and Scarlet Feather in my never ending To Be Read pile.	2001-09-16

Ms. Donati does not disappoint as Nathaniel, Elizabeth and their family are plunged headlong into a rousing new adventure overseas.

The story begins where the last left off, with Elizabeth giving birth to twins with only her step daughter Hannah to help her. Nathaniel, his father Hawkeye and family friend Robbie MacLachlan are imprisioned in Montreal, and Elizabeth soon packs up her children and sets out to help her men folk. A series of adventures, betrayals, and double crosses soon has the Bonner clan off to Scotland to meet the mysterious Earl of Carryck, who claims kinship to Hawkeye, and has plans for the entire Bonner family.<br />Although I found the book a bit slow going at first, I was soon completely enthralled with all the characters again and look forward to the third book in the series.	2001-09-04

Overlaying the story of the murder of two women on a remote island off the Maine coast, with the unraveling of Jean's own marriage, Shreve examines jealousy, passion, adultery and guilt and brings the consequences of a person's actions vividly to life. The story of Maren, the lone eyewitness to the murders, is very powerfully written. There were times when I felt I was living on the island with her. The story of Jean's suspicions about her husbands faithfulness, though not as compelling, helped to create a feeling of despair and sorrow that was at times painful to read. At the start of the book, I found the alternating voices of the two different tales a bit off putting, but the story eventually grabbed me, and would not let go. I devoured the last half of the book in one sitting, and haven't stopped thinking about it since. This is my second book by Shreve, and I hope to read more. She is rapidly becomming one of my favorite authors.	2001-08-11

In this book Guenevere is a Queen in her own right. She meets Arthur, the new High King when he rescues her from the marriage plans of her evil cousin Malgaunt. There begins the story of Arthur and Guenevere. Merlin is portrayed here as magical, and willing to do anything to make and keep Arthur king.  Morgan Le Fay is both mad and witch like. Morgause is not heard from much. In a different twist Guenevere and Arthur have a child, Amir. The story of the child directly impacts why Guenevere risks all for Lancelot's love.  The story does provide more human faces for most of the characters, and at times you can understand Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelots pain and longing.  However a good deal of the love scenes were written in a 'romance book' style that was very distracting for me, and veered from the usual tone of the book.  Towards the end I skipped over most of these scenes. I did enjoy the book enough to purchase the second book in the trilogy, The Knight of the Sacred Lake.	2001-08-08

Now John is back and has somehow been contracted to work on the FBI anti-terrorist  task force.  And one heck of a terrorist has just landed in America, and he is on a killing spree. It is up to John and his partner, the beautiful and bright Kate Mayfield to figure out who, what, when and where Asad Khalil will strike next. The book is written in alternating voices, from John's point of view, and from the terrorist, Asad's point of view.  It makes for some inteesting reading, and makes you understand the rationalization of a mass murderer, even if he is insane. The biggest problem with this book is the length. It could have been a couple of hundred pages shorter, and not lost anything in the telling. The ending of the book was a bit of a let down, but probably the most realistic one possible. Overall a fast paced read, but next time an editor needs to help cut the extraneous stuff out, to get the book down to a more mangeable size.	2001-08-07

However the unrelenting bleakness of the story just wore me down.  One of the reviews on the cover said : &quot;A page turner, gritty...funny,... sexy,.  It was a definite page turner, but it was  like watching a train wreck and not being able to turn away. It was gritty enough for me to feel like I needed to bathe after reading it.  I do not find anything funny or sexy about murder, sexual and physical abuse, not to mention incest and insanity.  If you enjoy reading books that are bleak, sad, sorrowful and with no happy ending in sight, this is the book for you.  Although I don't believe every book should have a happy ending, I read mostly for entertainment, and this book was not at all enjoyable for me.	2001-07-21

I have read and enjoyed all the alphabet books, and have really enjoyed Kinsey and her eccentric band of friends and relations.  But there was far too little of that in this mystery.  The story of the missing physician Dow Purcell was fairly uninvolving. The people in his life were people you cared little about, and the solution, or lack of one, at the conclusion of the book is very puzzling.  Although I think I understood what Kinsey &quot;was looking at all along&quot;, it surely could have had a much clearer ending.  The secondary story line involving the Hevener brothers was far more interesting, and also left quite a few ends dangling.  I expect Mariah Talbot to turn up in Q is for Quarry.  Lets hope it's a better addition to the series than this.  The book would normally rate 2 stars, one star is awarded because I still like Kinsey.	2001-07-08

Of course everyone reading the book knows who that man is, and it takes quite a bit of time and some tumultuous happenings until Lucy sees the light.  In the beginning of the book I sometimes found Lucy a bit unlikable, and unquestionably foolish in her choice of men.

That is the only reason for 0ne star.  I was excited about reading the latest installment in the series...  I should have read something else.  This book was a huge disappointment. Alex Cross is named well because he has one cross to bear after another. He is struck by one personal tragedy after another.  The sub-plot involving his children had no relationship to the story at all. Does Patterson have children?  If he does I'd like to meet them.  These children were totally unbelievable and alarmingly perfect!  The plot involving the \\"Mastermind\\" was non-existent.  One murder after another committed with no insight into the Mastermind's reasoning or ultimate plan. The final revelation left my jaw hanging. An obvious set-up to a sequel, I just wanted to throw the book at the wall.  I had already purchased 1st To Die, before I read this. I hope I am not disappointed again, because that will be the end of my reading Patterson.	2001-03-28

Although Anita is as good as ever, I found the story here a little confusing.  I did however enjoy the advancement of the Jean Claude storyline.  With Richard almost no where in sight in this book, there was a lot of interaction between JC and Anita, and we learn a bit more of his background.  I also enjoyed the development of of the character of Larry, Anita's protege.  I think this book is more of a turning point in the series, and although I don't think it is as good as the previous four books, a not so great Anita book is still better than a lot of the other stuff out there.	2001-03-06
US	52454113	R39IVIPN2STFI1	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Absolutely wonderful	An amazing example of storytelling at its best.  This book draws you into the lives of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, who was the father of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Afforded a small mention in the bible, Anita Diamant envisions the life of this biblical woman and breathes life into her.  I found myself going back to the Bible, to read the story of Dinah and Jacob, Joseph , Leah and Rachel.  To me that is an amazing feat, that the book became so true to me, that I felt compelled to read this part of the Bible again, something I have not done in years.  The book also offers the rare opportunity to hear a woman's voice, in biblical times.  Rarely do we hear the stories of these women, and although this is undoubtably fiction, it rang true from beginning to end. An absolute must read.	2001-02-26

Is it right to say anything bad about it?  Probably not. Yet I don't think I will read another Mitford book.  There was nothing really wrong with the book, yet I have no desire to go back to Mitford.  It was a nice town, full of nice people, who were nice to each other in a very nice way.  Even the `mystery' was nice with a nice solution.  The book had a nice group of characters who lived in a nice town, where nothing really bad happened. There was no tension or excitement to the book, because you just knew every problem would have a nice solution.  There was a very strong Christian faith theme running throughout the book, that could be a bit off putting to those of another faith, but over all it was a nice book.  If you are looking for nice, this is a book you will love.	2001-02-26

The captain is a member of the Italian Army who is being billeted with a family on the Island of Cephallonia, during the occupation. I loved the characters, the setting, and the romance.  I did not like the protracted chapters about the history of the island of Cephallonia, or the involved stories of Il Duce.  Overall those were minor complaints.  I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a timeless love story set in the midst of history.	2001-02-07

This book mixes humor, mystery and a good dollop in sex in a very light, easy to read &quot;beach book\\" No heavy thought needed, just come along for a good, fast, and entertaining read.  When Jaine Bright and her friends cook up the list for Mr. Perfect, they have no idea the impact it will have on their lives.  Somewhere out there is some one who doesn't like the list, and is going to make these women pay with their lives.  Detective Sam Donovan, who has a hate/love relationship with Jaine, is not going to let that happen.  I have to admit that I figured out the killer, long before the end of the book, but I still had fun getting there.	2001-02-07

As usual there are some new enemies Anita has to deal with, including jealous vampires and redneck cops. Through it all Anita tries to balance a normal life with her preternatural activities.  There is a good mystery here too: Who is kidnapping the were animals of St. Louis and where are they?  I liked the solution to the mystery and getting there was a great ride.  Can't wait to move onto Bloody Bones!	2001-01-22

Unfortunately he has also left behind an illegitimate son Miss Julia knew nothing about.  When the child's mother leaves her son on Miss Julia's doorstep, she has to learn to speak her mind and do the right thing, no matter how difficult. In true Southern style there are preachers, deputies, nosy neighbors and unscrupulous characters galore.  I laughed out loud more than once.  I would love to know Miss Julia, and her decidedly unconventional family.	2001-01-16

I have read a number of reviews here, complaining of the whining in this book. Having lived with an emotionally abusive parent, I found her story riveting. I related to so much of her yearning to be loved, wanted and accepted for who she was. The unending plotting of her &quot;wicked stepmother&quot; ultimately scarred the entire family. Everyone in that family learned to play the game. While perhaps her view of her own place in this family may be skewed by time, it is very hard to argue with the scenes of a small child sent to an orphanage, while her family still lived. I read this book in 2 days, always worrying about what would happen next, and fearing for what I felt would be a sad ending to a sad story. I was partly right.	2001-01-13

The story is a fairly simple one, dealing with a painting called the Shell Seekers,Penelope's prized possession,painted by her father.  When her three children find out that the painting is worth a small fortune they each have their own ideas about what to do with it.  As the story unfolds we learn of Penelope's unconventional upbringing, her loves and her sorrows.  Along the way I fell in love with Penelope, and by the end of the book wished she really existed. I loved the characters I met in this book, even though some were not very nice.  It seemed very much they way families interact with one another.  A must read.	2001-01-12

Amelia Peabody is an irrepressible archaeologist, married to the Father of Curses, the headstrong Radcliffe Emerson. Together with their incredibly precocious son Ramses, they set off for a dig in Egypt, which falls far short of their hopes for discovery of artifacts and antiquities. Along the way they cross paths with the Master Criminal of Egypt, and set about solving the mystery of The Mummy Case. Full of adventure, mystery and humor the third book in the series gives us our first introduction to the too clever for his own good Ramses. The book looses half a star, because of Ramses speech impediment, which drove me to distraction. Outside of that it was a fast and clever story, and if Amelia Peabody ever meets Indiana Jones, I am not sure who would come out the winner.	2001-01-12
US	52454113	RGSTK7OL06LVM	044652154X	933426195	Mortal Sins	Books	1	6	10	N	N	Beautiful Background, Boring People	The star for this book is really for New Orleans.  If the author wrote more about the city then the people who lived there, the book would have garnered more stars.  Boring, self absorbed people do not an interesting book make. Damon Rourke, the lead character while having some redeeming qualities, also appears to be just a lttle nuts. While very busy seeming to care about everyone in his town, he seems to have very lttle emotion left for his young daughter.  Remie Lelourie, his former lover, and leading suspect in her husband's death, is quite insane.  Yet we are supposed to find these very unappealing characters, romantic star crossed lovers.  I have read some reviews here that indicate Penn Williamson is a pseudonym for a romance writer.  Well it shows in the plotting and prose of this book.After reading about these characters, whom I had no desire to meet, greet or even pass by on the street, my whole reaction was who cares.	2001-01-08
US	52454113	RSNXP8X4GPK4A	0375705856	963629300	Plainsong	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Simple and Meaningful	A lovely and simple book, looking at life in a small town. The characterizations and interactions of the main characters was very real, drawing you into their complicated lives easily.  I loved the McPheron brothers and their simple but heart felt attempts to connect with the young Victoria Roubideaux. Tom Guthrie as a father stuggling to bring up his sons as a single parent was interesting, but I found his sons Bobby and Ike even more interesting. I like the way each persons life crossed into the others, all courtesy of the kind and seemingly all knowing Maggie Jones.  My only complaint is that I wish the ending had more resolution to it.  But life is like that, not everything is wrapped in a pretty package with a bow on it. All in all a very enjoyable book.	2001-01-04

The power of love, friendship and forgiveness is a universal theme, one we can all relate to.  The style of writing of Tsukiyama is very lyrical and understated. Some people may find this style of writing boring, but to me it was almost like reading poetry.  I had a deep feeling of peacefulness after reading this book and would recommend it very highly.	2001-01-03

I have read all the books in the series, and was happy to finally get The Last Precinct.  What a disappointment.  This book spends a great deal of time rehashing the past two books and an unbearable amount of time on Kay talking everything over with her friends.  There was a time when the focus of the books were criminals and solving the crimes via forensics.  Lately it seems as Kay is always the victim, with somebody out to get her.  After reading this book I was very let down.  While the main 'mystery' of this book is solved, it all seem slapped on at the end, and very contrived.  It seems as the whole point of the book was to set up the next book; which at this point, unless the reviews are great, I will probably skip.	2000-12-28

I thought this was an excellent sequel to that book.  As usual I found Gail Tsukiyama's writing lyrical, beautiful and very soothing.  The pace of her writing reminds me of peotry and I find her description of life in China, during very transitory times, fascinating and informative, without feeling as if I am having a history lesson. I felt very saddened when I finished this book, because I have known Pei since she was a little girl, and this book ends with her in her sixties.  Although I loved the book, It loses a star, becasue it just rushed through the last 20 years of her life, and I would have liked more.  Maybe she should write a book to fill in those blanks.	2000-12-19

Only you never find out anything about Zenia. And Roz, Tony and Charis are not people I cared very much about.  I think there  characters were pretty well defined, but I kept wondering about the men in  their lives and what these women saw in them, and what Zenia wanted with  them.

Of the 10 in the group only 3 managed to finish.  5 read the first couple of chapters and never went beyond, and the  last two quit about half way.  I finished the book, but I found it  overlong.  It was extremely slow moving and frequently boring.  I never  cared very much about any of the characters with the exception of Adah, and  it seemd as if the political agenda of the author frequently overwhelmed  the storytelling.  Not one I would be inclined to recommend or ever read  again.	2000-06-03

It accurately portrays the power of friendship, and the way women think, and talk. The voice of the book was very true to me. The story of the dying Ruth and the friends who stay with  her until the end touched my heart, and is not one I will easily forget.  Keep the tissues handy you will need them.  Although I cried I did not find  the book manipulative in trying to elicit tears, it just felt true.	2000-01-17
