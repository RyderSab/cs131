The highlights, of course, are on fighting fires. The illustrations are acutal photos of firefighters and their equipment. Some are cheesy and obviously staged, but they're charming nonetheless. <br />The firestation is obviously in a very large city and the equipment they use is impressive. Children from large cities will see something familiar; children from more rural areas will get to see the neat stuff that their local, small volunteer company doesn't have.<br />The words are simple and clear, suitable for the youngest firefighter enthusiast.  The pictures tell so much more of a story, though, and definitely make the book.<br />For those children also interested in police officers. The companion Welcome Book is every bit as good.	2002-08-29

Little Badger knows something that none of his forest friends do. Old Badger told him. He \\"wobble-waddles\\" around the forest, encountering various friends who tell him he ~can't~ be a pirate for one reason or another: he doesn't have the right hat, or eye patch, or bird, or whatever. Still, Little Badger knows.<br />This book strikes a refreshing note in a world where everyone has to have the right \\"stuff\\".  Little Badger knows that all he needs is his imagination (and to be home in time for supper!). Our clever little friend has listened to his elder, and has a wonderful time being \\"The Terror of the Seven Seas\\" because of it.	2002-08-27
US	51064944	R10QWP4HJMMMX6	0688165052	849519248	Crocodile Listens	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Good read-aloud book	With the repetition of sounds -- the thump, thump, thump of galloping giraffes; the tromp, tromp, tromp of trotting warthogs; the croak, croak, croak of calling frogs; and the adorable beeeeyo, beeeeyo, beeeeyo calls of the baby crocodiles -- this book begs to be read aloud. For a good storyteller, there is a lot to work with. It's truly fun to read with the frequent animal noises happening on every page. <br />Sadly, I can't say the same for the story itself. It's rather bland. The suspense is contrived.  Development of the plot gets lost in the author's attempt to slide in bits of information about the crocodile. The main point, the reason the Crocodile Listens, that she is listening for her babies to hatch, takes a minor role. <br />Even with all the fun noises, neither of my crocodile-interested boys (4 & 2.5), ask for this book much.  They *do* enjoy the noises and, oddly enough, remark every time on the croc being a Nile crocodile. Beyond that, their interest wanes.	2002-08-27

Happily, this is not one of those books. The book provides a nice amount of information on fire fighters including how they dress for a fire, how they fight fires and what they do after a fire. The information on their life in the fire station in between emergencies isn't covered in depth, but that's not primarily what interests preschoolers anyway.	2002-08-27

On the surface, the plot is, too.  Still, McPhail includes an important lesson in team work, helping others and handling difficult situations.  <br />On opposite sides of a stream, Jack the rabbit and Rick the bear want to play together. Jack has a log on his side of the stream, Rick a jump rope. Jack and Rick work together to overcome obstacles to get on the same side of the stream.<br />The story is nicely done in a simple first reader. It tells an interesting tale in words an early reader can handle. It's a great combination. It's even one that my 2 1/2 year-old enjoys having read to him.  All in all, the book is well done.	2002-08-25

From the zookeepers arriving in the early morning to feed the animals and clean their cages and the vendors preparing for the zoo's visitors, to the security guard locking the main gate and patroling the empty walkways, the book does a nice job of giving children a more in-depth view of the zoo. Veterinarians help sick animals and monitor the birth of baby animals. Construction workers build a new exhibit. Zoo keepers prepare the special foods that the animals eat. <br />Both my boys were able to easily relate things they'd seen at our zoo to the book. Their next visit, too, was filled with applying what they'd seen in the book to our zoo.<br />Gibbons' books are always excellent. Zoo brings alive a favorite place to visit in a very unique way.	2002-08-07

(Backyard Books)	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Food for the Imagination	Written as if the author is speaking directly to the reader, this wonderful book draws the reader into the world of the butterfly. It does a very appropriate job of explaining the life cycle of the butterfly in terms a preschooler can understand. The illustrations are also quite nice, not too detailed or flowery, not too plain. They complement the simple text very well. Especially nice are the ones near the end of the book of the little girl. <br />However, there are many nice books for preschoolers about butterflies. This particular book's special quality is in the way it invites the reader to imagine what it's like to be a butterfly. My preschoolers greatly enjoy \\"acting out\\" the book, starting as a caterpillar eating it's way out of an egg. The text is perfect for a simple preschooler \\"play\\". It gives them a creative way to move and physically explore what they've learned. <br />The ending to the book is very nice, too. Rather than just stopping once the caterpillar turns into a butterfly, or after explaining the common activities of butterflies, the book draws the reader back to reality. The reader doesn't look like a butterfly; the reader looks like, and is, a human child. The book briefly contrasts the differences between the butterfly and the human, listing good things about being a human.<br />The final pages list interesting facts about butterflies. Most are just a bit too complex for young preschoolers, but early grade school children should appreciate them. The admonition to not touch a butterfly's wings is well done and a nice way to end the book.	2002-04-20

From the way the fire fighters get into their boots & pants separately, to the page where we see fire fighters without a hose running through thick grey smoke down a 2nd floor hallway (ostensibly to rescue someone), to their return home to eat dinner before they clean the trucks and other equipment, almost every page has something incorrect on it. <br />Several pages into the book, the orientation shifts for one page only and the book must be turned sideways to see the picture of a ladder, propped against a burning building with two Dalmatian fire fighters on it. I understand the concept of wanting to accentuate the length of the ladder and the fire fighters being high up on a ladder, but it seems contrived and doesn't work well. <br />Also, I'm certain there's a reason why the fire fighters needed to be Dalmatians rather than actual humans, but it escapes me. It seems like an odd choice to make for a book that purports to show what real fire fighters are like...	2002-04-19
US	51064944	RTCOM3S8MHVJR	0823410404	473676164	The Planets	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Just a little bit more	Gail Gibbons book on the planets contains just a little bit more information than most young children's books on the subject. From information on how and why planets and stars look differently in the night sky to the distances of each planet from the sun, there's more for curious minds to ponder.<br />The book begins by explaining a few difference between stars and planets. It continues with how the planets were named and the later discovery of the outer three. Then our solar system, orbits and rotations are discussed. <br />Each planet is then explained in detail. The book does a nice job of choosing facts to present and keeping the topics consistent from planet to planet. Each planet's distance from the sun, relative size, length of day and year and are included. When appropriate moons are mentioned. Unlike many other young children's books on the planets, information on some of the more well-known moons of other planets is given. Considering the target audience of the book, the information is nicely comprehensive. <br />Toward the end of the book astronomers and space craft are very briefly mentioned. No information on space travel is included. As the title implies, the book focuses on information about the planets. <br />The illustrations are nicely done; the book contains no photographs. The drawings, however, are very detailed and present the planets in a nice perspective. They are very well done.	2002-03-26

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Perfect for the preschooler or young grade schooler	In her appropriate matter-of-fact style, Gail Gibbons, explains how a skyscraper is built. The language chosen is well suited to children age four and up.<br />The story starts as the reason for the building -- people needing a place to live and work. It briefly touches on the work of the engineers and architects before it starts describing the actual construction. Although it doesn't go into great depth, enough information is provided to spur further research for older children. For younger children, their questions are easily answered by adults and/or by looking at the wonderful illustrations.<br />The illustrations are perfectly detailed -- not too complex nor too simple. They do a very nice job of depicting all the work that goes on during the construction. They show everything from digging and building the foundation, through building the framework, the interior finishing work and finally the tenets moving into the building. <br />The book covers some rather advanced concepts that may go over the heads of younger audiences. The core of the building is discussed, as is fireproofing the beams, and building the curtain wall. Still, they are not covered in such detail to lose younger children. <br />This very nice book is currently one of the favorites of my two and four year-olds. Gail Gibbons books are always well-liked.	2002-03-26

The wonderful depictions of Farmer Bill, his farm and animals give the book much more depth than the forced rhymes. And frankly, they also do a better job of getting across the concepts of odd and even. <br />My preschool boys greatly enjoy the twist at the end of the book, where there's a glimpse of the next item that will be found to be missing. The fact that the found mittens are drawn as having parts missing pleases them also. It provides a great topic for discussion. <br />The follow-up suggestions are rather disappointing and unimaginative. The book certainly isn't helped by their inclusion.<br />I'd rate this as an average children's book. The basic story is quite cute, but the illustrations make the book.	2002-03-08

It's method of presentation in the book is just as well done. Unlike many of more crowded books on the solar system, it presents the solar system in more of a realistic environment: lots of uncluttered black space. <br />The first page starts with an illustration of the sun against a mostly black background: <br />\\"This is the sun, shining so bright, <BR>giving us the energy of heat and light.\\"<br />Turn a very small page, the first and smallest of nine progressively larger that eventually reach the full over-sized pages in the book. There you find Mercury with a brief poetic description of it and a repeating of the lines for the sun. Turn the next slightly larger page to see both Mercury and Venus. Here lines for Venus are found with a repeating of those for Mercury. Turn the next slight larger page and the pattern repeats until a full-sized page contains all nine planets and the lines for Pluto and Neptune. Turn the full-sized page and the completed poem, starting at the sun, is found. It's thoughtful and well written. To fully appreciate the poem, some basic knowledge of the plants is necessary, such as Uranus spinning on its side, Mars being red and the crossing of Neptune's and Pluto's orbits. <br />The following section, \\"Did You Know?\\" contains fairly detailed information about our universe, the solar system, the sun and planets. <br />The book contains no photographs, but because of the vivid illustrations, this is not a problem. <br />In one respect, the stickers are a bit disappointing. Although they claim to be reusable, they are very hard to remove when stuck to pages of the book. After discovering this, we haven't experimented with them very much. They do contain nice illustrations of the sun, planets, two space shuttles, three comets, two asteroid \\"belts\\", and three galaxies: irregular, spiral and barred spiral. <br />This book is well suited to childrenwho already have some background in the solar system. It does work as a nice complement to many of the basic beginner solar system books.	2002-03-06

Most pages contain \\"fact\\" secions with cartoon-type illustrations. The first reading with my four year-old son proved my initial impression wrong. Each of the cluttered, cheesy illustrations further explains a point in a way that was appealing to my son.  <br />The book does a very nice job of explaining our solar system to a preschooler. It starts as describing our solar system as a neighborhood. It presents interesting information about our sun, moon, and space travel, including living in space. Limited information is presented on the planets, meteors, asteroids, and comets. Each planet is very briefly described in only one or two sentences. As an example, the infomation on Jupiter does not mention the red spot. <br />A two-page spread of cartoon does a good, age-appropriate job of explaining what we do and do not know about space aliens. It's presented in a question and answer format between a girl and a grown man. <br />Fast facts about the planets are contained on another two-page spread. A graphic displays the planets relative sizes and lists their sizes in miles and kilometers. For each planet, information is given under headings of: Big or small, Surface (rocky, hard, soft, etc.), Hot or cold, Interesting fact, and Moons. The number of rings on the gas giants is not compared, nor is the information on each planet robust. <br />The final two pages contain space related puzzles and their answers. All are appropriate for my four year old. <br />Because of the format and illustrations, this book is very appealing to my children. The cartoon illustrations provide a special appeal. The lack of actual photographs don't seem to bother them. For it's price, it's hard to beat the amount of interest my preschoolers have in this book.	2002-03-06

In addition to limited information about the planets and the universe, and fairly extensive information about the sun, it includes information on the constellations, solar eclipses, telescopes, and the missions to the moon. <br />The information included presented in a way that makes this book appropriate for a wide age range of children. Its discussion of the sun is expanded to describe prominences, the meaning of light years and the Milky Way as well as our solar system's position in our galaxy. <br />The description of constellations is an overview only. The purpose of constellation is explained, but not how to find them.<br />The information on shooting stars, comets, solar eclipses and the phases of the moon are fairly detailed (for children). The illustrations for most of these are particularly good. <br />The pages covering telescopes which also covers several notable astronomers (Hipparchus, Newton & Galileo) are particularly good. Although the information is not extensive, it does cover enough detail to whet the appetite of a curious child. <br />The descriptions of the voyages to the moon are particularly good. The detail and words chosen are well done for young children, yet still convey the excitement of the events. Topics covered include the command module, rocket stages and even the path taken by Apollo 11 to the moon.<br />This sturdy board book has nice illustrations and excellent text. It's one my preschoolers request often and one that contains enough depth for them to learn more for years to come.	2002-03-06

The words are large and well spaced. The color photographs are large and show various angles of, what else, earthmovers. Close-up photos show parts like the can and the blade that are not easily seen from far away. In simple terms, the book explains the function and the parts of earthmovers. <br />It wouldn't have been one of my picks for a great book, but my four year old son adores it. My guess is boys fascinated with heavy machinery and constructions sites will love this book.	2002-02-08

The book covers space from Earth to our solar system and the universe to living in space or on other planets. It does a very nice job of explaining things like our atmosphere and why astronauts wear space suits. None of the topics are covered in-depth, but the book is a good starting point for further study for interested children. <br />The illustrations are very child-friendly. Most are color drawings, but a few color photographs are included also. The drawing of our solar system isn't the best. Because of the way it presents the planets in various parts of their orbits it's hard to see the order of the planets. Although the planets don't line up nicely on their own, it does make it easier for young minds to comprehend that way. Also, there no attempt to make the orbits even close to scale. All the planets are evenly spaced. No mention is made of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. <br />The book attempts to explain the effect of Earth's orbit and tilt on seasons. The description is not very clear for young minds. <br />The book also includes a Table of Contents, Index, Glossary, Reading List and Places to Visit list of museums and other space-related spots.	2002-02-08

Learn about animals singing Old MacDonald while reading a nice, easily washable plastic book. It's a great idea for a kids' book. Sadly the finished product isn't good.<br />First, the book is very nice in small hands. The illustrations are very nice, simple animals. The assortment of animals: horse, pigs, duck, cat, turkey and goat, are unique enough that they won't likely duplicate other books.<br />However, like many of those trendy greeting cards of the 80's and 90's, the pitch of Old MacDonald is much too high to comfortably sing along. It doesn't even well suit children's high voices. The sound is predictably tweeky and cheap -- not that that bothers my two boys. Each press of the button plays Old MacDonald through one time only. To sing through the whole book, the button needs to be pressed six times.<br />Pressing the button to play the song was too hard for either of my boys until they were over two years old. This meant that any time they wanted to hear the song, they needed to find a willing adult to press it for them. If they wanted to sing through the whole book, the adult needed to stay there to press it all six times. <br />After only two to three cleanings, the book started to fall apart. The book never went into the bath. First the musical button imbedded in the front cover broke loose, making it frustrating for both adult and child to find. Next, the plastic pages started to separate; the foam inserts easily tore apart and littered the floor. All this took place in less than three years. None of our other plastic, bathtub books that were played with as frequently, show any signs of wear.<br />It's a cute idea, but it's not well done.	2001-12-06

The prose has a nice cadence; the alliteration is wonderful. The words glide off the tongue. The watercolor illustrations are a perfect match for the crocodile's swamp.<br />The book is written with plenty of action without being too graphic. The crocodile hangs in the water; she jumps and snatches a heron as it flies by; she yawns, closes her eyes and sleeps in the sun. The mother crocodile cares for her newly hatched babies. The book even has some tension as a snake slithers toward the as yet unhatched crocodile eggs. <br />The words paint a lovely picture of the crocodile's home. The words invoke the senses and invite discussions of the swamp. Flies buzz in the sunshine. The swamp is murky and green.  At night, the swamp is steamy and black. <br />Although this book is a fictional story, it does slide in some interesting information for those newly interested in crocs. Birds pick food from between the crocodile's teeth. The mother crocodile carries her babies in her mouth.  <br />_Imagine You Are a Crococile_ is a favorite at our house with both the parents and the kids. This one I'll never get tired of reading.	2001-10-25

The book simply and plainly explains the differences and similarities of alligators and crocodiles. Appropriate photographs illustrate the concepts. <br />Topics such as geography, how they swim, size, body features, eggs, growth, diet, and history are covered in a brief overview appropriate for a preschooler. The final pages have an overview of selected &quot;new&quot; words learned from reading the book: crocodilian, alligator, crocodile caiman, gavial, etc. <br />When our 3 1/2 year old son became interested in crocodiles, this book was a wonderful resource. It spurred him to find more information on crocs and built a nice base for our further reading.	2001-10-25

It does. Rarely are we disappointed when we reach for this kid-friendly encyclopedia. Some entries cover several similar animals, such as the entry for the Kangaroo and Wallaby.<br />Each entry contains a nice combination of illustrations/photographs and text. The information is nicely geared toward preschoolers and younger elementary-aged children. So far, it's been able to answer most of the questions of my very inquisitive 3 1/2 year old.<br />The book contains a very nice table of contents, glossary and index. While finding information on animals, my son has also learned how to use these handy reference tools. However, the book does not contain a map. A map would be a welcome addition since the book often mentions where the animals live. We use a separate map/globe/atlas but it makes the whole process more bulky.<br />Several of the entries cover animal-related infomation: camoflage, communication, conservation, coral reef, defense, evolution, habitat, migration, and reproduction. There are also separate entries for amphibian, insect, mammal, and reptile.<br />The book contains some hand-on art and experiments for a few of the entries. The ones we have tried are very age appropriate for my 3 1/2 year old.<br />We've referred to this book a lot. Judging by the quality of information and the interest my son shows in it, we'll continue to do so for quite some time.	2001-10-25

As the mother rabbit picks up different quantities, the young rabbit whines and complains (in a cute way) about the amounts. The mother rabbit compares the amounts to other shoppers in the store using the terms more, fewer and same. Graphics summarize the terms for each item.  <br />The rhymes strike me as clumsy, but the book is fun to read with various voices for the mother and young rabbit. The young rabbit's facial expressions and gestures lend nicely to telling the story.<br />One part that might be of special interest is the young rabbits enthusiasm for carrots. He *likes* to eat them and begs his mother to buy more. For children who don't like carrots, this might just encourage them to &quot;munch, munch and crunch&quot; along with their rabbit friend. <br />Both my boys enjoy the book, but my 18 month old seems particularly enamored with it. It's a bit too basic for my three year old, but he still has fun with it.	2001-10-09

The problem comes in the way the drawings are done. On one page, we see a truck carrying three tigers. On the next page, a truck carrying two more tigers follows the first. Below is a billboard with the equation: 3+2=5. Enter the problem. Whereas in the equation the number 3 is on the left, in the illustration the picture of the truck with the three tigers is on the right side. Similarly, the 2 in the equation is to the right of the 3, in the drawing the truck with the two tigers is on the far left. It would have been *much* nicer if the layout of the equation and the layout of the truck corresponded to one another.<br />On a finer point, because in the USA (and obviously in other parts of the world) we read from left to right it's consistent to teach children to work this way, too. Having children jump around to count first the three tigers on the right, then jump left to count the remaining two can cause unnecessary confusion.<br />To be fair, above the equation are pictures of the corresponding number of tigers, so the tigers can be counted/viewed there also. Still, the awkward positioning is unfortunate.<br />The rhyming text is adequate, but nothing special. The illustrations are very nice. They manage to be interesting and colorful without distracting from the actual story.<br />From the rave reviews I read on the MathStart series, I expected more.	2001-08-22

Of course, like any good mother hen with a nest full of eggs, she's sitting on her eggs. The farm cat, dog, cow and horse all ask her why she's not outside enjoying the day. Mother Hen's response is always, &quot;Cluck, click, I can't come out. I must sit on my eggs and keep them warm.&quot; Afterward, Mother Hen &quot;fluffed out her feathers and settled herself again on her nest of soft, golden hay, where she cuddled her ten white eggs.&quot;  The repetition of these phrases is calming as it's carried through the book.  The dialog between the animals helps the story to flow, as well as helping children to identify with the characters.  <br />What wonderful values Mother Hen teaches children. Sometimes there are obligations beyound what we want to do. In the end, Mother Hen is rewarded for her faithfulness -- her ten white eggs yield ten yellow chickens.  The cat, dog, cow and horse celebrate with Mother Hen. Offspring are indeed a blessing. <br />At first, I found the illustrations too disjointed for children. Mine, however, have had not difficulty identifying with them. They are bright and colorful watercolor (I believe). The illustrations are not too busy, but contain enough objects to identify for younger children. <br />My rating of this unassuming little book has increased as I've watched my children interact with it. The small nature of the book fits nicely in children's hands. It's lasted very well with two small boys, both of whom really enjoy reading _Mother Hen_.	2001-06-23

From digging a hole to standing on top of someone's thumb, we follow along as the dog learns a lot of words and concepts. We learn opposites: dark/light, day/night, here/there; we learn colors; we learn actions: wash your ears, scratch your head, blow your nose; we learn silliness: kiss the goose, clean the zoo. <br />The pictures lend themselves well to pointing out objects and asking children questions. Yet they are simple enough not to be distracting. <br />Our one year old requests this book quite often, as did his brother well into his 2's. It's the perfect size for little hands. It travels well, too. Our oldest was able to describe the illustrations just enough that we could use the book to spur conversations while in the car, making car rides more fun.	2001-04-18

I purchased this book to help explain the real Saint Nicholas (as opposed to Santa Claus) to my son. I vascilated quite a bit on whether to return the book or keep it.<br />The author's choice of content is a bit unusual for my needs. The book starts by explaining that Nicholas was born to older parents who were wealthy and charitable. Next it mentions the parents' death (with an illustration I'd rather have been skipped, more on that below) and Nicholas' continuation of his parents' charity. The book continues with some events of Saint Nicholas' life with nice detail: saving the three daughters from slavery, his entry into the priesthood, his intervention during the stormy voyage, his appointment as bishop, the legend of the schoolboys, and his suffering in Roman prison for his convictions. His adoption as patron saint of various groups is mentioned in context. In the Author's Note, written more for parents than children, the author mentions the connection between Saint Nicholas and our present day Santa Claus.<br />The style of the illustrations is very nice. A &quot;pieced&quot; stained glass effect, it suits the material very well. Most of the illustrations represent the text nicely. The one exception is the page where the death of Nicholas' parents from the plague is mentioned. Here we see a large black cloud filled with scary-looking skeletons that appear to lurch in the direction of the boy Nicholas. Nicholas looks frightened even though his uncle's arm is around him. Before it's next use, I will glue the pages together and just skip it entirely. The dealth of Nicholas' parents can easily be incorporated into the next page where the book speaks of Nicholas' being his parents' heir and continuing their charity.<br />The book does a nice job of covering the life of Saint Nicholas, but it's nothing special.	2001-03-02

Books	5	19	19	N	N	Wonderful way for Christian parents to explain Santa Claus	After searching for a way to explain to our children why, as a part of celebrating Jesus' birthday, there's a large fat man flying around giving &quot;good&quot; children presents, I finally I found this treasure of a book.  The book is very simple with nice black and white drawings, detailed enough to hold the attention of younger children, but not so catchy as to detract from the important message.<br />The premise of the book is a little girl is making sugar cookies with her mother, when she notices the Santa cookie cutter.  Thus begins a discussion between mother and daughter about why Santa is a part of Christmas.  <br />The book does an excellent job of simply and intelligently explaining to children about Saint Nicholas.  The mother explains, in a way likely acceptable to both Protestants and Roman Catholics, the snippets we &quot;know&quot; about Saint Nicholas, a man who served God.  She tells the stories about Nicholas being caught in a boat in a terrible storm, how he became the Bishop and how he provided the dowry for the three sisters.  <br />The book ends with an explanation of how Saint Nicholas changed into Santa Claus and, more importantly, how a &quot;generous stranger...who brings gifts&quot; reminds us of God's even better gift of Jesus.  <br />This book is easily used by families who choose to include Santa in their celebrations, as well as those who chose to exclude him.  Although I wasn't able to use it this year, I believe my 2 1/2 year old son would have been able to grasp the concepts.  It will definitely be part of our celebration next year.	2001-01-04

The simple rhymes tend to get lost as we're reading the book, but it's because we're enjoying the pictures and concepts so much.  <br />The family in the book prepares for Christmas, and we count as they prepare. Each picture is very beautifully done and makes a great starting point for a discussion of families, working together, and Christmas, just to name a few.  The book places the emphasis of Christmas on the family spending time together, not on receiving gifts.  Three generations enjoy the preparations, ending with my 2.5yo son's favorite page where &quot;ten joyful folks wish peace for all!&quot;<br />This is a truly special book. I'm already looking forward to next Christmas.	2001-01-01

Finally, after spotting several things that are NOT her bike, she does indeed find her bike parked beside a tree.  On each page, a cutsie animal peeks through from the previous page, helping to narrate the story.<br />The whole cut out/peek-a-boo theme doesn't work well at all.  The rhymes aren't at all natural and don't have a good flow to them.  The book attempts to teach differences between Sister Bear's trike and the other objects she mistakes for her trike.

The idea of a puzzle book sounds fun, but it doesn't work in this form.  Here's the plot: it's Bo Peep's birthday, but she can't celebrate because  all her sheep are missing, so she must go find them; she looks in the  desert, the big city (using a &quot;jet plane&quot; with a propeller! )  until she finds a note from her sheep telling her to go to the boat house.   The page facing where Bo Peep gets the note is the puzzle of the sheep  throwing her a surprise party.  But here's the problem: there's no way to  easily/neatly keep the puzzle pieces with the book unless they're put  together, thus spoiling the whole puzzle surprize effect.  To keep the  surprize, the puzzle needs to be taken apart just prior to reading the  book, and that tends to spoil the surprize, too.  I've tried storing the  pieces in an envelope taped to the back of the book, but then it doesn't  store in the bookshelves well.  The puzzle itself is still beyong the  capabilities of my two year old (and he solves lots of puzzles).  <br />The  illustrations are extremely bright and colorful, perhaps even gaudy.  The  drawings are simple, yet hide some unusual surprises, most of which are  thus far lost on my two year old: sheep figures are hidden in the clouds,  the buildings in the big city have sad faces.  <br />I plan to use this book  as a special birthday book.  With the puzzle it's just cute enough to  become a nice birthday tradition.	2000-08-17

The book has 25 &quot;reusable stickers&quot;  (actually clings) of various pieces of clothing and accessories (skis,  ball,...) that Busy Bear can take on his trip.  In the back of the book is  Busy Bear's closet, where he can try on the clothes and accessories.<br />The  storyline is fairly simple: Busy Bear wakes up early to get ready for his  trip and wonders what the weather will be like and what he should pack.   The story is well worded with lots of action words that allow young  children to act out what's happening in the book.  Busy Bear snores; he  jumps out of bed; he makes breakfast and listens to music; he hops into the  shower.  Busy Bear imagines the places he might go, a beach, a tall  mountain, to a pool.  The situations in the book provide opportunities to  discuss weather, the clothing we wear, and what different places are like.   Of course, it's a good way to introduce children to someone going on a  trip, too.  The book's illustrations are simple and very cute for young  children.  <br />Busy Bear is a favorite at our house.	2000-08-11

Unhappily, it is common for the  verses to be highly edited, removing large parts of them and in some cases  taking the words out of context.  Elipses note the removal of words.  It's  not uncommon to have several sets of elipses in each quote.  Most of the  Old Testament stories come from Genesis or Exodus.  The New Testament  stories are from the Gospels and Acts.  Some of the stories are not told in  the same &quot;voice&quot; as the original scriptures.  Whereas the story  is basically the same, I'd prefer that the way the story is told remain  true to the Word.  <br />The wording of the stories is nicely done and fits  the vocabulary and understanding of toddlers very well.  Like most  paraphrases, there are times I'd choose different words, but most of the  changes would be minor.  The illustrations are very nice and simple and  apply well to the stories.  They provide a good way to expand on the  brevity of each story since I think the book often tends to shorten and  simplify them a bit too much.  <br />If you know your Bible fairly well and  feel comfortable adlibbing your way through the more common stories, this  isn't a bad book.	2000-08-08

This is an incredible book.  It is well suited to bedtime stories, family  devotions, Sunday School, or homeschool.  I use it for all of the  above!<br />The illustrations are very well done.  They are perfectly detailed  to hold young childrens' interest, yet not too busy.    The format of the  book is large, so it is easily used for a group.  Each story is  approximately eight pages long and has its own style of drawing and font.   The stories are told in child-friendly language, but unlike some childrens'  Bible storybooks, they do not compromise the actual Biblical story.    <br />Following each story are three pages of activities: prayers, songs (sung  to the tune of familar childrens' songs), rhymes, crafts, snacks, games,  finger plays, service projects, etc.  The ideas are fresh and use  inexpensive materials usually found around the house.  For homeschoolers,  the activities provide a variety of ways to incorporate other subjects into  the lesson.  The possibilities are exciting.  <br />I can't imagine a more  perfect book for teaching young children about God's Word.  This is a great  book.	2000-08-03

As a fan of Mr. Liddy's radio talk show, I was prepared for an excellent thriller.  However, I was a bit disappointed.  The plot is action-packed, but a bit light on development.  The book comes to a rather abrupt,  anticlimactic end.  Mr. Liddy sometimes spends a bit too much time on the  technical details (which are fascinating nonetheless). Having said that, I  still recommend it for anyone looking for an action thriller.  I'd guess  most people won't figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is until the end.   <br />The &quot;voice&quot; of the book is unmistakable Liddy.  The main  character, Mike Stone, a former Navy SEAL, oozes bravado from the start.   Eventually Liddy gives him a bit more personality and creates a more  believable character.  It seems that Mrs. Liddy even makes an appearance as  the main character's widowed Aunt.  <br />The plot twists several times and is  anything but predictable.  If nothing else, reading _The Monkey Handlers_  will make most people stop and think.	2000-07-06

For those  parents unsure about how to homeschool, this should provide reassurance  that all necessary areas are being covered.  A detailed list of concepts  taught is included for all of the various subjects.  <br />For my tastes, it's  a bit too structured and too much like school-at-home.  The author suggests  a school schedule that breaks some tasks down into as little as 5 minute  intervals.  The calendar time recommended for each morning, where the  children recite the days of the week, date and numbers 1-50 (progressing to  1-100) seems too much like the rote memorization and drill technique used  in public schools.  <br />The book does, however, contains some excellent  ideas for learning/teaching.  The Grid, a matching game, is a great tool  for various types of learning.  The suggestions on house cleaning,  including how to involve the children, is insightful.  The ideas on  follow-up and review after a field trip are quite good, too.  <br />The  information above indicates that the book is spiral bound.  It's not.  It's  a standard 8 1/2 X 11 paperback.

Forty-two walks are detailed in this guide to hiking the Great Smoky Mountains.  Numerous other walks are briefly listed at the end of each chapter.  Hikes are listed geographically in 11 areas, with two to six hikes per area.  <br />The description for each hike includes the distance,  difficulty (easy, moderate or strenuous), elevation (including elevation  changes), location of the trailhead, and a description of the walk itself.   The descriptions are sometimes rather wordy, but do often include  interesting historical or natural information.  A trail map is included for  most of the walks.  The appendix includes a thorough bird list.<br />We found  many very interesting walks in this book.  Some of the walks listed are the  more popular ones, but there are enough of the infrequently visited trails  for those who don't want a lot of company on their excursions.  <br />As the  book mentions, it frequently rains in the Smokys.

The twenty hikes are divided into five each of short, half-day, full-day and overnight hikes.  Each trail description includes the start and end point,  distance, elevation changes, time required and comments.<br />Although we  didn't try any of the overnight excursions, we did try at least one of the  other categories.  We especially liked the full-day hike (#14) to 7 Mile  Hole.  The side trip to Washburn Hot Springs is well worth the effort.   Overall, we found the descriptions accurate and relatively easy to follow,  although natural changes can effect some of the descriptions (for example,  fire damage).  <br />The book contains several good resources for  inexperienced hikers, including good rules for hiking and essential  equipment lists.  A chart lists the type of features (waterfalls, geysers,  wildflowers, etc) found on each of the hikes.  Small sections of the USGS  maps are included for many of the hikes, although purchasing a TOPO map is  recommended.  <br />The book is physically small so it fits well in a pack.   It weathered our hikes well, too.  We'll use it again and again.	2000-04-30

Mr. Fletcher describes his adventure of becoming a B-17 pilot from volunteering to flying missions in Europe.  The process is fascinating and the details of the the training make the book incredibly interesting.  It's very unfortunate this book is  out of print.  I'm guarding my copy very closely.<br />It makes a great  companion to a copy of the original film about the Memphis Belle.	2000-04-28

Since I'm not a sci-fi fan, I was skeptical.  To my surprize, the book is a fun read.  No, it's not a piece of intensely deep literature.  It's good-versus-evil, space-aliens-versus-earth-men escapest science fiction.  Yes, the science in unbelievable.  No, the characters aren't  thoroughly developed; analyzing characters in this book is a waste of time.   For all of this, the book is enjoyable.  Generally once I've read a book,  I'm not interested in reading it again.  This one, I'll read again.	2000-04-28
US	51064944	R1ZG2E75KRWX8C	0517613514	424122617	American Warplanes	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great reference	I couldn't begin to count the number of times we've used this book to find information on a particular aircraft.  And, I can't remember ever being disappointed.  The book is packed with information on American military  aircraft.  At a minimum, each entry includes at least one picture, sketches  of several silhouette views, information on the aircraft's dimensions,  weight, available armament configurations and the aircraft's history,  including dates of service.  I can't imagine a better reference book.	2000-04-28

Blackford Oakes, CIA operative, is sent to Great Britian to track down a spy who is passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets.  It's his first mission, and it's definitely an unusual one (OK, all of Blacky's missions are unusual).  I've read all of Buckley's Blackford Oakes series and each is  fun and entertaining.  Each details an interesting theory/fantasy into a  particular piece of history; each seems fairly plausible.  I recommend all  of WFB's spy novels.  Read one and you'll find that you're hooked.	2000-04-25

After a lot of research, I bought this book.  From first glance, I knew I had the right book.  Recipes run the gamut from simple and tasty Maccaroni and Cheese to more complex Sweet and Sour Chicken.  The book contains  recipes for breakfast, breads, soups, main &amp; side dishes, fish &amp;  game, international, beverages, and desserts &amp; snacks.  One chapter  covers equipment and camp cooking techniques.  At just over 200 pages, it's  chocked full of great camp cooking ideas.<br />Many of the recipes call for  dried foods, some of which may be hard to find in smaller towns.  However,  there is a chapter that explains the basics of home food drying.  <br />This  is a great resource for anyone who enjoys camping.  Whether you camp in a  backwoods primitive camp or a more modern setting, you're certain to find  plenty to enjoy from this cookbook!	2000-04-24
US	51064944	R1GVOR4V8ZKU4C	0399210687	593566200	Spot Goes Splash!	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A fun book!	I bought this book when my son was 6 months old.  From the first reading, it's been one of his favorites.  We started just pointing and naming objects: flowers, ball, house, etc.  More than a year later, we're still reading it, but now we're counting the flowers, describing the ball's shape  or the house's color, etc.  It's proved to be versatile.  The simple, yet  pleasing, pictures of Spot splashing in the garden, in rain puddles, at the  beach and in the bathtub are perfect for babies and toddlers.  One caution:  once my son learned to splash in the tub, we had to start explaining that  we don't splash water all over the bathroom!  I'd definitely buy it again.	2000-04-24

I could not tell what, if any, position they took on the massacre at My Lai.  The book is very chilling and should be read by anyone interested in America's  involvement in SE Asia.	2000-04-24

I seriously wonder whether the person read it before they bought it.  Although colorful, the illustrations often don't well represent the rhymes.  The rhyme about Davy the Dumpling, whom we boil in pot, then butter &amp; sugar and eat is truly bizzare.   We'll be losing this book very soon.	2000-04-24
US	51064944	R3BL2NDJOXR07V	0395620384	830214365	We Have a Baby	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Excellent book to help younger children	I purchased several books for our almost-two-year-old to help him understand the new baby.  This is by far his favorite.  The simple explanations of the baby and the family's interaction (We have a Baby.  A baby to love. A baby to hold....) with the new baby are wonderful.  The  pictures are lovely and perfect for a small child.  It was such a great  book, I bought one for a friend who also has an almost-two-year-old and a  new baby.<br />Spend the money and purchase the hardcover/library edition.   It's worth it.	2000-04-16
US	51064944	R2ZCT9WQYM51WI	0688145078	189565917	I'm a Big Brother	Books	4	96	110	N	N	A good book.	This is one of several books I bought for my almost-two-year-old.  It's one of his favorites.  The book deals with the addition of a baby very matter-of-factly, but positively.  Both Mommy &amp; Daddy take care of the  baby.  Daddy even changes a diaper.  It gives a very positive account of  the new baby in respect to the big brother, too.  The advantages of being a  big boy and big brother are highlighted.  I've given this book as a gift  for friends having their second child.	2000-04-16

Our almost 2 year-old loved the handle and clasp used to close the book.  He carries it around all the time.  I read a lot of baby/toddler books about the Christmas story and this was the one I settled on.  The natural  rhymes and simple pictures work well for toddlers.  I especially like that  the story presents the wise men arriving LATER when baby Jesus is living in  a cottage, not a babe in the manger.  The is one book we'll read for years  to come!  (It's January and he still asks for it nightly....)	2000-01-05
US	51064944	R3FMICKBYNP756	0781400767	840318541	The Baby Bible Storybook	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Adequate, but the best I could find.	Many of the stories are too complex for babies and toddlers.  For our 20 month-old we use only 4 of the 20 (or so) because of difficult content.  Most of the actions mean you can't have the child sitting on your lap while  reading the story.  The actions, though, do help keep the child's  attention.  The pictures are simple enough for toddlers and babies, for  adult tastes they definitely are too cutsey.  The pages are very durable  and withstand being handled by little hands.  All in all, I'm still looking  for a *good* Bible storybook.	1999-12-13
