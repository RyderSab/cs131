I have always had an interest in OpenBSD because of the security first attitude and I started using FreeBSD on several servers last year.<br /><br />Now I find myself with several sparc64 machines with nothing to do. Looking over my network, I see that I can use a bridge with pf enabled in a couple of places as well as a Load Balancer or two. So in comes OpenBSD.<br /><br />This book was a pleasure to read and reference while getting the OpenBSD boxen in line. It covers the basics of installing, upgrading, patching, and other Sys Admin tasks. It also has three chapters on pf (the firewall for openbsd) which is a major strength of this os.<br />It was a great intro and fun read (my wife thinks I am disturbed for reading it at the pool :-), while then turning to the OpenBSD FAQ for more insight.<br /><br /> I have become a rabid fan of OpenBSD and see it having a larger role in future deployments of mine.<br />If you are new to OpenBSD with some Unix-type background, this is the book you need to get started with little fuss.	2004-07-01

This book is the best Tomcat book yet for Administrators. I have used the others (Professional Apache-Tomcat, Mastering Tomcat Development, and Apache-Jakarta Tomcat), but this one has been the best. It is very well organized and has some great helps in it. It does not try to cover everything, but it focuses on some. For example, Tomcat 3 is not covered by this book. Mod_webapp is not covered, but mod_jk2 is very well covered. The authors covers how to secure Tomcat through chroot (using a special file they ported from OpenBSD called jbchroot.c), run Tomcat as an unpriviledged user on port 80, Clustering with or without Apache, Apache integration is given REAL coverage. The best thing about this book is the focus on Administration and not development, this is obviously for administrators. The other books were focused on developers and were either way to short or had way too much scattered and confused information. Admins like things well organized and consistant.<br />If you are a Sys Admin and need a book on Tomcat administration, get this book and forget about the rest.	2003-07-07

It was basr bones and dry (as are most vender sanctioned books are). It was lacking in detailed and real world examples. It tells you the commands for troubleshooting ipsec or isakmp, but does not really give you a lot of good information on deciphering the output of these commands.<br />If you simply need to know the commands and how-to of setting up a VPN, then this should work ok.<br />Note: My review was based of of the PIX sections of the book only.	2003-01-08

I liked how it did not just inform you about these tools but actually had you use them to gain understanding. Any good systems/network admin should be familier with the tools in this book. Both UNIX and Windows admins will gain great experiance and understanding of their systems weaknesses.<br />I have read many books on &quot;hacking&quot; and security and this one is the only one that actually has you use these tools.<br />It is setup in a very easy to follow and understand format. This book is  a must for EVERY Admin, not just for preparing you for a test. Even if you never take a security exam, this book will give you great intro and experience with the use of the tools described.	2003-01-08

I like the size of the book; it was not crammed with useless pictures, tables, or filler.<br />Sure, you can pour over tons of online Sun Documentation scatterd thoughout the Answerbook series or even dig through the man pages. Who has that much time? I needed to get quick organized understanding of my options in securing Solaris 8. Some of the chapters will be basic reading for some and reviews for others. However, a new Solaris admin who need to learn good idas on security can start here. The experienced UNIX/Linux/BSD admin can also pick up this book to learn the specific options available on the Solaris plateform. You will also learn about the short-comings of it as well (such as not coming with ssh; remedied in Solaris 9). You learn how to configure the Solaris TCP/IP stack and it's implementation of IPSEC. These two where the most useful chapters in the whole book for me.<br />All in all, if you admin Solaris 7/8/9 you should check this book out.	2003-01-08

Most computer books I read as needed or use them as a refference, however I read this book through cover to cover.<br />I have not had formal Cisco training, so what I have learned has all been through books and online docs. If you are to buy ONE Cisco PIX book, this is the one. It covered EVERYTHING there is to know about the PIX. From what type of pix to choose for your needs, to licensing, to VPNs, access-lists vs conduits, attack guards, etc. I have the Official books by Cisco and they were ok for an intro and basic use, but Mr Deal goes into great real world use and explaination of all the PIX's features.<br />This is the book for ANYONE interested in PIX. If you are buying a PIX, check out Chapter 2 before hand.	2003-01-07
US	44684627	R3PG6WE2LJD1GY	1587050358	538107564	Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Somewhat limited	As you can expect from an &quot;Official&quot; book, this one is somewhat limited. It does provide a good intro to most of the commands and how to configure a pix for secure use. It is quick and concise. If that is what you need, then this will work.<br />However, some of the info is outdated and it does not cover the different versions/abilities of the PIX FOS. For example, it covers conduits but has no discussion of access-lists. Since Cisco is discontinuing conduit commands, this dates the book.<br />However, it is a decent referrence for most commands, and I guess it contains the info it does due to it being a cuorse book for the CQS-I Exam it is ok.<br />But if you really want an in depth coverage of PIX and the FOS then  I recommend &quot;Cisco PIX Firewalls&quot; by Deal.	2003-01-07

Exctied over a SysaAdmin book? This one was not only good USEFUL technical information, but it was easy to read.<br />What makes this book so useful is that it is filled with information that I can use. It explained some differences with Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD that I needed to see side by side since I support all these. I found the info on kernel tuning, interface tuning and such to be most helpful. I have been supporting various flavors of UNIX for 6 years and this book is the best. I consider this the UNIX Bible.<br />Especially helpful was the recommendation of a well stocked Company Wine Cellar to cure &quot;System Administrator's Syndrome&quot;. I am having difficulty getting this funded however.<br />In all seriousness, this book belongs on every UNIX admins desk. If you are looking for something to help you setup KDE on Red Hat, this book is not for you. It is for people who admin *ix servers.	2002-12-04

This book is easy to read and provides some entertainment with the authors' insight into Linux administration. As with it's brother the UAH, this book follows the same format but IS updated to reflect the Linux specifics. I picked it up also because it covers RH 7.2 and the UAH only covered 6.2. This book is a must for people who admin linux servers for large corporations, small businesses, or simply are running their own mail/dns/web server from their DSL connection at home.<br />If you are looking for a book that gets you setup on KDE or GNOME, this is not the book. If you want to learn and use the power of a networked Linux server, this is for you.<br />I have worked with UNIX for 6 years, Linux for 5 and recommend this book to anyone who will admin it.	2002-12-04

This book presents Revelation in the context as the people it was written to (the seven churches of Asia). If your understanding of Revelation would mean nothing to Christians in the first century then it is wrong. Get this book and get started with serious study of Revelation.

However, it seems she gets more and more preachy every book she writes. I want to read a great story, not lectured on her views of the world. The story would not have suffered any, if these preaching interludes were left out. This is the last Anne Rice book I bought and it will remain that way. It is too bad, because Lestat was pretty cool.	2002-07-30

I really did not want to know much either. However, I must know something of it's design and layout. I also need to know what services/daemons do what. However, all the books I found covered Oracle on NT/2000. Who in their right mind would do such a thing! Anyway, this book as sufficient coverage of Oracle on Solaris that it helped get me up to speed on Oracle enough to understand an Oracle DBA when they speak!	2002-07-30

I found this book to cover the broad topic very well with little bais. There is some bais (as there is in ALL writings), but not so much that it slaps you in the face.<br />The best aspect of the book was it's readability. I simply could not put it down! This is very refreshing as opposed to reading dry, stuffy, boring, books about church history. He seems to write with a passion for the church and that makes it an entertaining as well as informative read.	2002-07-30

I knew to turn off services I recognized but that is about it. Since we only really use NT for the PDC, the file server, and internal groupware client- I really was not interested in pouring over documentation to secure these boxes. I have too much to do in keeping the frontline unix boxes secure.<br />Norberg introduces the architecture and services and othter things that I really did not know about. He then gives practical suggestions on how to lock down the server. He does state that this is a for a bastion host, so that rules out a web server anyway.<br />However, this book explains the services and what would need turned off, you can then modify this to your needs.<br />This book is a must for any Unix admin that needs to learn about WinNt and security for it. I give this book five stars for being exactly what it says it is.	2002-05-07

It gave a great intro to the different email protocols and the big three MTAs (sendmail,qmail,postfix). I have no postfix experience, but have used both sendmail and qmail. As a matter of fact, I just used this book in conjunction with &quot;The qmail Handbook&quot; by Sill, to switch from sendmail to qmail as an external mail relay. I liked the quick treatment and explaination of all three MTAs. This book gave me an un-biased explaination of the three. That enabled me to make an informed decision on IF I wanted to move from sendmail, and if I did, do I choose postfix or qmail. In the end I decided qmail was the way to go. qmail ROCKS!!<br />Anyway, this is a great book for anyone needing a good comparisson of sendmail-qmail-postifx. It also provides some good ideas for security.	2002-04-04

This book is exactly what it say it is, a qmail handbook.<br /><br />Using this book, I was able to setup qmail and get it running without a hitch. I loved the layout of the book. Basically Sill gets right down to the task of why you bought the book- installing qmail. You can read &quot;ahead&quot; on the chapters and then walk through or you can simply walk through the book following the chapters and install qmail. The Appendices at the end where great. I personally suggest reading through these BEFORE you start the 1st chapter, but that is my own prefference.<br /><br />The Appendices cover topics like &quot;How qmail works&quot;, &quot;qmail features&quot;, &quot;Gotchas&quot;, etc. However, they are appendices so you can read them if you want to. Unlike the Sendmail bat book, where you have to wade through understanding internet mail and such, these are at the end in Sills book. It is a matter of prefference, but I would still recommend you read them (Especially the part on how qmail works!!!).<br /><br />If you are new to qmail, and need to setup a server without straining you eyes on a computer screen, this is the book you need. It covers using qmail as your imap/pop server, as a external mail relay (a must for keeping your internal Exchange server secure), mailing lists, anti-spam, webmail, and many more features. This is really the only book you need if you are running qmail.	2002-01-15

I personally don't like reading HOWTOs, FAQs, etc on the Computer screen (trying to save my eyes). Anyway, this book gives a well ordered explaination of ssh giving you the ability to read by topic. For example, if you are interested in the options available to configure the authentication process, it is not simply lumped in the list of sshd_config options, but is ALL located in the same place with a good discussion of the option. It is well indexed to find what you need quickly.<br />One of the best features of the book is that it covers ssh1,<br />ssh2, and Openssh. Using the authentication example, the book gives you how ssh1 handles it first, then ssh2, and then Openssh. Which is important since they will sometimes handle things differently.<br />This is only the second book I have used that covers SSH, and it is without a doubt, the better of the two. If you use SSH for production systems, this book is a must.	2002-01-14

I really needed to understand DNS/BIND; not just know how to start, run, and update it- but really understand DNS. This book was perfect. The authors introduced DNS with a high-level overview and then moved in closer to help you set it up. You can actually read the fist 3 chapters and work through the next 2 while setting up your server and domain. The rest of the book really gets into the nuts and bolts of DNS and BIND. Don't stop after chapter 5, continue reading and pick all the knowledge you will need to be a DNS/BIND admin.	2002-01-09

This book is targeted specifically at VB/Access/MS-SQL programmers who are considering moving to MySQL/Linux/Gtk+. This book is perfect for anyone coming from a Microsoft Database programming environment. Mr Stucky's first chapter comparison of MySQL's features AND shortcomings versus Access and MS-SQL is the best introduction and explanation of MySQL I have ever read. This book is not for &quot;newbie&quot; programmers. He assumes (and lets you know in the intro) that you should have a minimal understanding of both C and visual programming, the book is not a programming tutorial. It is a book that will make the job of a VB programmer learning Gtk+ much easier. The book is full of code which is excellently explained throughout. The meat of the book is a step by step explanation for best practices for building the client side interface. He deals with the building of each object in great detail, handling all the nuances for VB programmers. This is a great book for ANYONE coming from a MS background who wants to get up to speed with Gtk/MySQL programing in a hurry.	2001-08-27

I bought this more for a refference (and they had a 25% off sale on Tech books that day :-), but have used it exclusively ever since. This book is VERY informative and I would recommend it for beginners as well as people familier with perl. Perhaps the best quality of this book is that it does not assume you are programmer already. So the beginner can pick it up at chapter one and go from there. The experienced perl programmer will also find this book very handy and it mill most likely not leave his side.	2001-08-07

Sure there are some things I felt out of place (the server discussion in chapter 3 I felt could have come later). I thought the book to be useful overall. The discussion on configure/make/make install; while mundane to an experienced admin, would be invaluable for a novice. I felt that this book has value as a reference in SSH. The only suggestion I have is that a more thorough explanation of authenticating with public keys would have been helpful.  In site of that, I believe this will be an excellent book with a few minor tweaks in a second edition. I am sure Ms. Carasik is reading these comments and taking them into consideration. The previous reviews of one star are a bit harsh. The comments about HOWTOs and man pages by previous reviewers are not necessary. If you look hard enough you can find all you need to do anything in man pages and HOWTOs. Books are for those of use who would rather have something more convenient.	2001-05-21

If you do not know anything about shell scripting at all, read this book and you will. The author walks you through example after example that you can replicate while you work your way through the book. Each chapter builds on the previous and is very thorough in it's explaination. This is a great book for beginners and a an awesome reference book for more knowledgable. This book is also a great primer for those who wish to embark upon learning to program	2001-03-23

I would also recommend this book to IT managers/directors/etc. This book is more than just an explaination of security holes/fixes but puts you into the mind of the cracker. You must see the world as the cracker does in order to defend yourself. In Patton, Patton was shouting &quot;I read your book&quot; to Rommel as he beat Rommel in a tank battle. This is the same for System/Netowkr Admins everywhere, it is imperitive we read the cracker's book and understand his assault from beginning to end. Only then can you be prepared. This will also wake up your managers if they are not paranoid enough :-)	2001-03-23

I then received one of these books (3rd edition) with every VA Linux box we ordered, so I shouldn't complain since it was free, BUUUUT... It seems that some of the material is out of date. There are some new chapters, but a new edition needs updating in every chapter for the book to remain relevant. That said however, I find my self referencing this book occasionally. I do recommend this book to the new systems administrator for a Linux system. There can never be a COMPLETE UNIX/Linux System Administrations book all in one book, but this makes a good attempt.	2001-03-23

I have this book, but I have reaely referenced it. Being what it is, the man pages are just as helpful. Some people however, do not like reading from a computer screen, I can understnad that, a book is just more comfortable- this book is for them.  My biggest gripe is that this book is not organized well. A book of this type should simply organize the commands alphabetically. However, it is a decent book and the information is quite useful. So because it is a useful book that I simply don't like by prefrence i gave it three stars.	2001-03-23

I had to deploy MySQL on a Solaris e250 and had ZERO knowledge of MySQL. I found all the answers I needed to setup and manage MySQL. I also had referenced this is a much more thorough book than the offering by O'Reilly (MySQL &amp; mSQL). If you need a database you can manage with little or no hassle, and do it quickly this is book you need. It is also pretty good at explaining the options for connecting to the DB via various interfaces/languages. For a web-based interface I recommend PHP, and the book &quot;PHP Essentials&quot;.	2001-03-23

I really hate to give such a miserable rating but there are simply much better books out there for a new Solaris Admin.	2001-03-23

If you are administrating Solaris 7 or 8 I would look elsewhere or wait for the next edition.	2001-03-23
US	44684627	R2JU2KFFIJN1IQ	1576105474	425668772	Solaris 7 System Administrator Exam Cram (Exam: 310-009, 310-010)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Book is what it says it is	This book is exactly what it says it is, an exam cram sheet. If you think you can read this book and pass the Solaris 7 test without ever laying hands on a Solaris system, you will fail the test. This book simply crystalizes the information an experienced Solaris Admin already knows. It gives you exactly what you need for the test. If you are a Solaris Admin and what to become a Certified Solaris Admin then this book is the only book you need. Five stars for being exactly what it claims to be.	2001-03-23

Since I already had a Linux box that was not doing much of anything, I loaded INN (since it comes nicely packaged with Red Hat- although you need to install the security patch as well). I then needed a quick understanding of how Usenet/INN worked and did not have a lot of time to spend on it. This book gave me everything I need, I did not have to go anywhere else for information.	2001-03-23
US	44684627	RRTI7KNSLPOYI	0130960535	29521491	Solaris Security	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Decent High Level Intro	This book is a decent intro to security on a Solaris system. If you are a new Solaris admin, this book is a great read. It does cover a lot of topics from a high level, so it is lacking on a lot of practicals. It will give you a decent idea of where you to go. A good starting point, but you need to get into some other security books to get the nitty gritty details.	2001-03-22
