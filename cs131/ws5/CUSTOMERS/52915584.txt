She just casually mentions, one day .. \\"I'll take you there.\\"  <br /> <br />And that is the the journey that Joyce Carol Oates book takes you on as you read. And again, as you read it, you realize that she did take you \\"there\\" into the life of a young author whose name you never do find out. This young lady narrates the entire book. You read about three stages of her late adolescence - her short time in a sorority, her dismal and hopeless love-affair with a graduate student, and then her post-college experience to run to the side of a father who neglected her throughout her entire childhood. Really, what you find on this journey is a young girl who tries to find herself; a young girl who never really experienced love: first as a child, looking for acceptance in a sorority, obsessing and justifying an affair with a grad student who pays her absolutely no attention nor ever returns her affections - and then flying to the side of someone who has abandoned her throughout her entire life. But at the end, there is hope, and you get the sense that she found out who she is, she found closure, and she arrived at her destination.	2005-08-11

Interestingly enough, that is a theme in her latest book. <br />To summarize, Betta Nolan is trying to get her life on track after the death of her husband and what seems to be, her only friend. She picks up and moves from their home on the East Coast to the Midwest and starts life anew. In addition, she picks up the phone and dials an old friend from college. <br /> <br />This book is about starting over, and somehow also about picking up where you left off. How one's decisions impacts those around and can change lives for the better. As for when Betta moves to the Midwest she touches so many lives around her, from the little boy next door to a college student living in a cheap rental house and his foreign roommate, to a middle-aged man and her old best from from college. In so many ways, \\"this year of pleasure\\" where she was forced out of her shell has shown her how much she had been missing by focusing all her time and energy inward and on her husband. From being selfish to becoming a very giving, loving person, this story is very lighthearted and leaves us all learning a good lesson.	2005-08-01
US	52915584	R7L6U20NCCRTW	0156006529	957325974	Where or When  : A Novel	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Enticing, but unlikeable.	I was attracted to the idea of this novel: two middle-aged adults, married with children, rekindling an old friendship. As a fan of Shreve's, I was excited about the possibilities that this novel presented. Many people wonder what their past love-interests are doing, and maybe once in awhile think about those past events. <br /> <br />However, the antihero in this novel, Charles, is immediately sent into this stalker like mentality all from the picture of a former girlfriend, whom he sees in a newspaper advertisement for her poetry book. Here is a man who is married, has wonderful kids, but is a failure at his business. He admits that he loves his wife. Yet, his pursuit of Sian Richards is very psychotic, and if I were Sian, I would have been scared to death by his intense interest. <br /> <br />I found it extremely hard-to-believe, that after 31 years, Sian would have accepted his letters (his scary stalker letters) - some letters in which he was writing 3-4 times a day and sending them to her in a package. After spending 1 week together at a church camp, then having 31 years of history with other lovers (marriage, children, friends, jobs) - that falling back into a relationship with that boyfriend/friend would have taken much more than a couple of letters to rekindle. The entire time I was thinking that it was just highly unlikely, and that Charles was extremely sleezy and creepy.  <br /> <br />As a woman, I feel that if I were to get a letter or letters like that, I would have approached the situation much more cautiously, and that no matter how hard your life is, that there is more value to the marriage and family that you have created to throw it away so fleetingly --- to a person you hardly knew. <br /> <br />This book may have been more believable if perhaps there was some indication that these two characters Sian and Charles were filled with a lifetime of regret for that lost love of when they were 14. If there had been some indication that throughout theiradult lives Sian and Charles had tried to locate one another (ideally before they got married to other people) but hence where unsuccessful and then perhaps given up that chase. Therefore, when Charles saw Sian's picture in the paper, and then was consumed with this passion and desire for a lost love, I would have had more sympathy for the characters.	2005-06-21
US	52915584	RGVE15UUZXPBB	0316781487	223736820	Light on Snow	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Different Angle for Anita Shreve	Let me start by saying, I liked this book. Shreve fans who expect her usual plot-twist and somewhat thriller might be disappointed with this novel. However, I found myself engrossed in the story plucked sadly from the headlines. A baby abandoned in the snow, luckily discovered by a widower and his 12 year old daughter.  <br />I found the depth in which Shreve describes the two main characters: father and daughter, very well done. You are given a sense of history of the two, which helps you identify with their struggle and accept their decisions. A third character, the abandoned baby's mother, enters the scene, and again, the depth with which Shreve describes her is very well done. Although her crime is heinous, she wins you over.  <br />Obviously I will not give away the ending -- but I encourage her fans and new readers to stick with Shreve on this one. I have read all of her books, and although this is not my favorite (The Last Time They Met is by far!) I still found it to be an engrossing and a satisfying read. I liked this direction she has taken with this book - slightly different from her normal path of plot-twisting thrillers. I really enjoyed this one and I think you will too.	2004-12-27

To me, it sounded like it was called \\"Kissing Your Ex\\" just because there is a lack of a better way to explain the novel. I won't go into summaries or anything like that - I save that for the other reviewers.  <br />The writing for this novel, first of all, is amazing. The main characters Jack and Maddy - WOW! The insight into their lives especially, is very well written. I enjoyed the plot outline, how the reader is given a glimpse into Maddy's life after she and her husband Jack split up, and how she has started a new life for herself in a different part of the country. I found myself really getting into this novel - the insight into human character and emotion is just amazing. One of the tidbits of dialouge that I remember vividly was about the fact that perhaps the only true love you really experience is your first love. Every other \\"love\\" after that is really not love at all. I found myself really thinking about this line for awhile after I read that book and it makes me wonder if it is true. According to Stevens in this book, it definitely is true. Maddy never gets over Jack as much as she would like to, and Jack never gets over Maddy. It's one of those love stories that I will read and reread over time for the mere satisfaction of knowing that here are two people that are DEFINITELY meant to be together and you just keep rooting them on. This book is filled with many tender moments, aweseome dialogue (and I mean it! Stevens has really nailed it on the head when it comes to men and women relating to each other in this way, and even gets their body language down to a science).  <br />After I finished reading it, I truly was thinking about some of the moments and conversations in this book and reminsicing about my past love!	2004-09-12

Interesting Perspective	It has been a long time since I first read this book, (1994) - however, this biography of Grace Kelly is one that forever stands out in my mind as a great portrayal of the princess and actress. <BR>Quine writes of Grace as only a best friend can. She shows Grace Kelly in good times and sad times, exploring her emotions and her fears and overall, portrays the princess as a real human being. I couldn't help but feel that as I read this book Quine was letting me into Grace Kelly's life a little more than she should, and by the time I finished this book, I felt I knew more about Grace Kelly than ever the media could allow me to. I felt literally, like one of Grace Kelly's friends or even a confidant. That is how close Quine brings you to this legendary person.	2004-07-15

My favorite hobby is cooking for my family and friends, and Sunday dinners have long been a tradition going back to my own Grandmother's table when I was a child. It was over her table that I got to know her and my grandfather and share time and fellowship with my aunts, uncles, and cousins. Without those times together I wonder if we would be as close as we are today.<BR>This book however, is absolutely beautiful. It offers an endless array of menu ideas and wonderful, delicious recipes to satisfy any taste. I think the layout is perfectly done -- each menu is preluded with stories of the food selection and the meaning that Sunday dinner has had for people in their lives. The book is highly inspirational in this respect, taking us back to a simpler time, that doesn't have to remain in the past.<BR>Some of the recipes are labor intensive -- which I don't mind because I enjoy cooking -- however I can understand that it might be a burden for the time-sensitive cook. I don't see anything wrong with substitutions made from time to time for added convenience (like ready made rolls instead of handmade, for example). But the recipes that I have tried are delicious and reminiscent of foods that my grandmother used to make when we would be over for Sunday dinner.<BR>This book contains dozens of &quot;traditions&quot; for the entire year, which I feel will inspire many cooks and leave loving memories for their family and friends for decades to come.	2003-12-19

I made my &quot;living&quot; caring for other people's children in the Chicago area throughout my high school years and also through college, and I have to agree whole-heartedly with both McLaughlin and Kraus on some of the experiences they portrayed. While all these experiences may not have happened with one particular family, I have to say that at one time or another throughout my career, and with one family or another, those occurances did happen, as odd as some of them might be.<br />The book is excellent. It makes me angry to think how some people treat their children, expecting other people to raise them and share in those experiences that are meant for parent and child. It is also absurd, albeit a reality, on how some people treat their help. I, like Nanny, felt the most sorry for the children. Many times I couldn't bring myself to leave them in their time of need or pain.<br />I hope that others who read this book enjoy it as much as I did. It is an extremely dark comedy. I wish what happends in the book did not really go on in real-life, but that is the tragedy of reality.	2003-07-17

Howard Johnson give the reader a clear understanding of what the midwest was facing at the time of settlement by describing in wonderful details the geography and wildlife, as well as the hardships faced by early pioneers. My students, who usually don't enjoy anything I assign them to read (or at least tell me they don't) - were very perked-up about this novel, and were disappointed when they were through. I feel that they truly learned a lesson about early pioneers and their experience, much as what the \\"Little House\\" books did for me when I was 8 years old. It's just a shame that this book is so short. Those in Indiana, esp. the Indianapolis region, will really get a joy of reading this book as it takes place in Marion Co. However, any student of midwestern history, no matter how old will find it just as satisfying.	2003-06-30

Carrie Bell was faced with a choice - she can stay with the quadrapalegic fiancee that she had been thinking about breaking up with before his accident, or she can leave. She chooses to leave and for that she has to face the consequences of emotional guilt from her friends and from herself. I liked this book because it made me think about Carrie's situation and what I would have done. I'm a 20-something female myself, and to wonder if the situation Carrie was in is something that I could have handled well at 23, I think not. It's a very engrossing book which I ripped through in 2 days. *I obviously don't work!* I was very satisfied when it was over with and would recommend it to all my friends...	2003-06-30

The subject matter is one that I think many single women in the earlier thirties or even later has \\"entertained\\" at one time or another. I know that the subject matter really piqued my interested, as it relates to things that I had hoped to have one day - a family and a husband. At like the title implies, the main character felt that she had to compensate somehow until, you know, \\"the real thing did come along.\\"<br />The main character, Patty, desperately wants a baby. However, she doesn't have a husband and the biological clock is ticking. She is a great character, and I loved reading about her as she developed throughout the novel. She was humorous, she had feelings, and she had problems with her family, her friends, her work, and her love life of course. She has this best friend, Ethan, who happens to be a gay man. He seemed pretty secure to me in the fact he was gay. Knowing many gay men, who too also seemed to be secure in their homosexuality, it seemed peculiar to me that Ethan went along with Patty's plan. Perhaps there are more gay men out there like Ethan that I am completely unaware of. I think this was my major hang-up with the book, which prevented me from completely enjoying it altogether.<br />On the whole, for an enjoyable read, and as something you will get through in the matter of a few days, I found this book to be quite satisfying and also interesting and fun too. To be entertained by a book, and to be satisfied is all that I ask, and this book accomplished both tasks. For it to draw out emotions in me, or to make me \\"think\\" about life, I would have to say it failed. But it was still not a waste by any means.	2002-12-30

This is the second Berg novel that I have read. The first one, \\"What We Keep\\" did not appeal to me at all, and it took me awhile before I picked up another novel by her. <BR>I was thrilled by this piece of writing! I think that in many ways, Patty relates to the average woman. I think that many of us ache to be mothers when we are pursuing a career, and many of us also lust after the wrong guys (even the gay ones). I thought that the writing was very light-hearted, and I loved the smart-mouthed Patty. I think that Berg writes her characters as \\"real\\" people, and found myself amazed that some of the things going through Patty's head, actually had gone through mine many many times. <BR>I recommend this novel. It was interesting, and I thought that the subject matter contained was interesting as well. I related to her main character, and I cried quite a bit at the end. It's funny to think this, but perhaps I had found someone whom I related to, and it was sad to let her go.<BR>It's amazing to think of the compromises that we make in order to make others dreams come true. <BR>Anyhow, get this book and read it. If you are disappointed, at least the novel is short enough where you don't feel that you wasted too much time. I don't think you'll be disappointed though. It's a page-turner.	2002-12-05

Whether it is for someone with little knowledge as to who this vast bureaucracy works, or for someone with a fairly good knowledge of it all - I don't think it will disappoint. <BR>I think what I appreciated the most was the honesty that the text was written. The authors also included a good amount of humor to emphasize the point (in cartoon, comic, Top 10 List, etc), in order to keep a reader interested. <BR>I think this text is also a good reference as well, as there are numerous court cases and explicit examples of gov't at work - that if you are ever at a loss for &quot;what was it that happened?&quot; or &quot;what does that term mean?&quot; Things are extremely easy to find and be referred to.<BR>Good works.	2002-08-11

It also is very honest and matter-of-fact when talking about finances, and is not over the average person's head regarding money-lingo. <BR>I think that this book was the most financially intelligent book that I have bought in the past few years.	2002-08-11

These are just a few words of a long list I would use to describe &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; by Jane Smiley. I have always been entranced by American Tragedies - and this one fits the bill. The story is very complex, interwoven character developments that make you love and hate each one of the characters, and come away feeling like you have known them and lived next door to them your entire life.<BR>The book is narrated by Ginny, the eldest daughter of an Iowan farmer and controlling patriarch. And without giving away too much detail - I was completely blown away by the tragic events that unfold. I rejoiced when they rejoiced, and was devastated when any of the characters were devastated. I feel that it is appropriately narrated by Ginny. She seesm the most level-headed and honest of the lot. I need to give kudos to Smiley for the wonderful descriptive and accurate detail of farm-life. She has it down to a tee - with the terms, the attitudes, the emotions that are tied into farming... just superb research on her end that attributed to a very well written and engrossing story.	2002-01-02

I am at the point in life where I am making life-decisions at an alarming rate. I'm getting married next year, and I met my future husband just earlier this year. I never doubted our relationship for one bit, even though some less-supportive friends have questioned the validity of our relationship. Then I came across Anne Tyler's book, and I was intrigued. Her story really made me think and evaluate my own life. <BR>This is the first time in a long time where a book has actually made me think about my own life. What if I never left my college-sweetheart? What if I had decided to go to culinary school instead of teacher college? I mean, really, a book can make me think about my life in one sitting, where years of conversation and journal writing could not? Seriously, it had. <BR>&quot;Back When We Were Grown-Ups&quot; is a very intelligent book. I have no idea if this story-line was ever used before - but to me, this was new, and the ideas in it are very new, rather like a choose-your-own-adventure. I almost feel sorry for the main character, Rebecca. I'm torn between what she is living/experiencing, and the life that I &quot;think&quot; she wants to lead. <BR>What happened was that I got extremely consumed with this book. It not only made me question Rebecca's life, but my own life as well. This novel did was help me reaffirm that I am capable at making good decisions, and made me think about how my decisions know will affect my life in the near and distant future. What this book did was get me to imagine what-if?, and then shrug my shoulders to confirm that yes, I live in the present, and I have made good choices along the way. <BR>I highly recommend this novel for many reasons. If anything, it will get to you think about your life - past, present, and the future.	2001-12-18

Professor Madison does a nice job outlining Indiana's history in a way that the average arm-chair historian can understand without any difficulty whatsoever. The first section is devoted to the land and the early people who inhabited the land. He does a great job getting the geographical history down in a concise manner. It's easy to ramble about the topic, but Madison does a nice job of being brief, but also impeccable with content. He covers all the bases. <BR>I particulary enjoy the social history, which talks about race-relations and also about people who helped form the State. <br />Most major events in American History are taken from the Hoosier perspective as well. While reading, you can tell that Madison has a particular love for the State of Indiana. He writes about it in such a way that demonstrates his admiration for the early settlers, but also he looks at them from a realistic point of view. He does not write history from rose-colored glasses, and writes in a honest and refreshing sort of way. <br />My only complaint would be that there needs to be more pictures. I do have to add that the photos included are obviously carefully selected, as they make silent statements in themselves. For example, the one of Klan members exiting a church in rural Knox, Indiana, or the one of a one-room delapitated school house in northern Clinton Co. He did a great job in selecting appropriate photos... I only wish there were more.	2001-11-01

So.... I don't recommend this book for a variety of reasons. One is that I tried to follow the Zone perfectly and I found that it was very difficult to do so. Unless you have someone preparing the meals for you, it is hard to strictly adhere to the portions and the ingredients that the Zone suggests. Secondly, I found the Zone to be unrealistic. I love bread and carbohydrates. All my life I have learned that it is necessary to eat carbohydrates if you want any energy. Our bodies need to burn the sugars in order for us to function effectively throughout the day. I didn't feel that the Zone paid enough attention to this fact, and I found that I had little energy to do thing I normally enjoy doing - like bike-riding. To me, I find it healthier to eat what I want in moderation and to exercise 3 to 4 times a week. This way I have my dessert and eat it to, plus I found I had more energy. <BR>I don't recommend this book. If you are serious about losing weight, seriously analyze your eating habits, get off your butt and exercise.	2001-10-30

The author starts out by telling the gripping and true tale of the lynching of 2 black teenagers in a small Indiana town in 1930. I live near this town and never ever heard of anything ever happening like this. History we are ashamed of apparently gets swept under the rug. This book opened my eyes to race-relations in Indiana and in the northern states during the early 20th's century. It really sets the stage for the Civil Rights acts that follow - and it's is wonderful to understand it from such a local perspective. <BR>This book is not about &quot;lynching&quot;. It is about injustice and mob-mentalities, as well as the history of race-relations in the U.S. - from the perspective of a small midwestern town. A town that many people would consider to be a typical place. The history written is non-fiction, although I wish in many ways it were fiction. I find it difficult to grasp that humans act the ways they do, and the author did a fabulous job of remaining objective and explaining the facts in a sleuth-like manner.	2001-10-30

Emotional is an understatment in reading this non-fiction account of a lynching in Marion, Indiana. All kinds of emotions come to mind as I read through it - anger, disbelief, sadness, shame. I think that much of it can be summed up by gazing at the front cover for awhile - the cover photograph is a timeless statement on race-relations in Indiana in the early 20th century. <BR>This work reads like a gripping movie-script, a drama and detective story, where you find heroes abound by their courage to speak up against the actions of the mob who lynched 2 teen-agers on a summer night. But unfortunately this work is not fiction, it is true - from the accounts of what happened in the town the night the boys were suspected of killing a white teen and raping his girlfriend on lovers-lane, to the mob-mentality that eventually took the lives of these two boys. I live near the town where it happened, and I wish it weren't true.<BR>The author did a superb job getting this early 20th century American history to read like something from one's imagination - he is truly gifted as a historical writer - as the words jump off the page as you read, gripping you, entangling you in the tragedy, and making emotions (ones that you probably don't like to express) - flood through you.	2001-10-24

Elizabeth Berg's novel &quot;What We Keep&quot; has two narrators: The 11-year-old Ginny and then the adult 40-something Ginny. It's interesting to hear the two narrators comment on events throughout the book from both perspectives of childlike-ness and then adult-maturity.<BR>I felt this book was lacking depth; that some conflicts were resolved so simply &quot;as no big deal&quot;. Taking place in the 1950's and 1960's, and then looking back in retrospect, perhaps some things were just never talked about in real-life. People really &quot;kept&quot; things to themselves as so not to burden their family members. It was just best to leave things alone. <BR>As any psychiatrist can attest, keeping things inside is unhealthy, and sooner or later, you will break-down.... as Berg describes very well in the book. <BR>I only gave this book 2 stars because I thought the story-line was predictable, and that more attention could have been paid to explain events as to why things happend. I was left wondering &quot;why&quot;, and thinking, &quot;that was too easy... as if that would happen (or someone would react that way) - in real life.	2001-09-04

Education	I needed to get this textbook for a graduate level course on Social Issues in American Education. I think it is a wonderful introductory text to the history of education, as well as many of the schools and philosophies of thought that debate continually in American Education today. Many topics are covered that you hear about in the news and other media. Reviewing the facts on these issues (as Spring presents them terrifically) - will help you make your own decisions regarding these important issues.           The text is very much a history text, and many of my colleagues had a difficulty reading through it. Many of them read the book like a textbook, and not as something that they could enjoy and actually get valuable information. Spring does a terrific job of displaying the facts of history and development of issues, and then explaining them to the fullest potential. I was fuzzy on a few educational issues, but Spring's clarity helped me understand them more completely. This book might also serve as a reference for one to go back to when an educational issue arises. Spring is continually amending the book through newer editions, so it is possible that one could use this book as a reference until the newer edition comes along.                   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher or thinking about going into the education profession - or anyone who is more interested in the American Schools. As a teacher, I found it very informative, and the history and statistics, overall interesting. If you aren't into the summary and digestion of statistics, this book might not be for you. I enjoyed it thoroughly however.	2001-07-12

US	52915584	RPCVYU8ZZOJ2X	0151004536	271428762	Longing	Books	2	14	18	N	N	Preconceived notions got in the way	I heard about JD Landis's book, &quot;Longing&quot; while listening to my local NPR radio station, where they featured his book on their weekly book commentary. It sounded interesting at the time - as a lover of classical music, and an admirer of Clara Wieck Schumann, I thought that I could not lose out by reading this book. I was very interested in reading it!<br />    My excitement in reading the book helped me through the first 100 pages or so - but then I found the reading tedious. I thought that the author did a great job in allowing the complexity in the relationship between Clara and Robert show through his writing, and it was very fun to have him fantasize about the funloving friendships between Mendellsohn and Chopin, Clara and Robert. When he threw Brahms into the mix, I got confused. I admire Brahms greatly, and prehaps his insinuation that a relationship between Clara and Johannes Brahms disturbed me. I don't know if that is entirely fact or fiction. Perhaps my own thoughts of disbelief tainted my motivation to read the rest of the book. <br />    I found finishing the book challenging. I felt that Landis did a great job describing the earlier years of Clara's and Robert's life together as classical music prodigies, but once they broke out on their own, my interest wained. I realize that this is a work of fiction, but it does not read as such. I applaud Landis's research, however, I was overall disappointed by the outcome into a novel such as this. I sincerely gave it a chance. Perhaps I want to remember these performers and composers in a different light than what Landis had painted them, and I could not get over my stubborn mindset.	2001-07-03

I thoroughly enjoyed Tracy Chevalier's book, &quot;Girl with the Pearl Earring.&quot; I knew nothing about Vermeer prior to reading this book. I didn't even recognize the painting on the cover of the book - however, my book club chose to read this as their selection for May, and I wanted to keep up with them. <br />    &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is descriptive and moving, and Chevalier does a fabulous job of catching and describing the feelings and demonstrating the emotions that Griet has in having to leave her close-knit Protestant family to live with the famed painter Vermeer and his Catholic family in 17th century Delft. To imagine what it was like for a 16 year old girl to leave the comfort of her own home and abandon her relationships with her family is overwhelming. Chevalier does a wonderful job of showing the internal conflict that Griet is having throughout the book. She is torn between doing her job and what she feels is best for her relationships with those she loves.<br />    This book is not long at all, and it reads quickly, as you are captivated and drawn into Griet's life and relationships with the butcher's son, her brother, and her ill-fated little sister. This book is filled with tragedy as well as triumph, and makes me wonder about the story behind all those paintings I've come to take for granted.	2001-07-03
US	52915584	R3U2Z96AVNGKQ1	0316789844	35085155	Resistance: A Novel	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Educational and Captivating	Prior to reading &quot;Resistance&quot; by Anita Shreve, I did not know much about the Nazi Resistance in Belgium. It was interesting to read about a different side of the war, one that is often neglected - the homefront. In Belgium, resistance fighters took refugees who were escaping Nazi persecution due to religion or nationality, or depending, which side of the war they were fighting for. I found this book to be very enlightening, educational and overall excellent. It was exciting to see a romance blossom amidst the horrible war going on. In classic Shreve style, she twists the plot left and right, keeping you on the edge of your seat and your finger ready to turn the page at each moment.	2001-02-11

I am a historical reenactor, and part of my passion for the hobby is recreating the lifestyle lived long ago as closely as possible. This book helped me immensely. I was  able to understand how women especially passed their time and to pick up  ways in which to create my character to her greatest potential. So many  times while reading books about colonial Americans, women are virtually  left out - I know they did something - but what was that something? This  book helped me understand what their daily lives were all about.	2000-05-14

I found it extremely insightful as to the most quaint New England towns to visit, which are the best routes  to get there, practical information on the restaurants in town as well as  their price ranges for any type of budgets - as well as advice on the many  different bed and breakfasts that are available. This book caters to all  travel styles, preferences and budgets. I planned most of my vacation with  this book because it had phone numbers, prices, excellent directions... I  could probably go on and on. Definitely a must for anyone who is traveling  and not familiar with the area. It's like talking to someone who has lived  in New England their whole life and is on hand to give you all the  practical information you need to have a successful and fun/relaxing  vacation. As if the book weren't great enough - they give you a wonderful  full-sized pullout map that has all the towns marked on it which are  mentioned in the book.	2000-05-14

It has held fast as my inspiration for the profession.  One never realizes the responsibility teachers carry on their shoulders on  a day to day basis. Kidder fantastically shows this courage, compassion,  and love for children that teachers need in order to go into such a  powerful profession. <br />After digesting this book, I reflected on what  teaching actually entailed. I knew then that this was what I would like to  do. You are not only a teacher to children, but you are in many way their  only positive role-model. Sometimes you are the only adult they see for the  majority of the day and their greatest influence in those early years of  their lives. But you are not only their teacher, but their nurse, their  confidant, their disciplinarian, and the role-model in which they learn  what is acceptable behavior in society. <br />This book is a wonderful  reflection on what happens in the American classroom. I really appreciated  reading it.	2000-05-13

I'll be honest, I wasn't too excited about reading this novel for a class. However I was pleasantly surprised when I finished the novel after not being able to put it down for 2 days. It is a wonderful portrait of the  city of Indianapolis and how it changed in just what seems like a few years  around the turn of the century. It's interesting to contrast those in the  city who choose not to change, and those who decide to proceed and adjust  with changes. The novel teaches us all a very valuable lesson about life in  the end. The Magnificent Ambersons really is a great book. I highly  recommend reading it.	2000-05-13

It was sentimental and sappy, both of which I love, but the ending  disturbed me.	2000-04-10
