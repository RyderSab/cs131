If you've a sceptical bone in your body, consider spending your money somewhere else. This book is one part theory, five parts anecdotal evidence judiciously selected by the authors in support of their theory. Anecdotal evidence has next to no intellectual value when used to support generalisations of the sort made by Messrs Herman and Chomsky.<br /><br />In buying this book I was principally interested in Chomsky and Herman's arguments, which are set out in the first chapter and a half of the book. They are conveniently set out on page 2, and I can further summarise them:<br /><br />Before being published, all news in America is run (consiously or subconsciously) through the following five \\"filters\\":<br /><br />1: The size, concentrated ownership and profit orientation of the Mass Media: economic barriers to entry into the media market are high, the class of media organisations is small, concentrated and cross-owned, and all media owners are driven by profit: that is, they have to print something that will sell. A less conspiracy-laden rendering of that assertion is this: if you publish something the public think is a load of rubbish, you'll go bust.<br /><br />2: Advertising as a main source of income for print media. Messrs Chomsky and Herman  believe it isn't so much \\"what will sell\\" as \\"what is will be agreeble to advertisers\\" which is important. They clearly think these two concepts are substantially different, but they provide no arguments at all to support that conjecture, except a single (anecdotal) instance of the failure of an apparently widely read socialist worker's paper which, for all we know, could have gone bust for any number of reasons (for example, the arrival of another, better newspaper in the market, or that its readership began to think it was publishing a pile of rubbish).<br /><br />3: The reliance of the media on information provided or sponsored by government, business and other \\"agents of power\\".<br /><br />4: Public and official complaint on press content as a way of disciplining the media; and<br /><br />5: Anti-communism as a national religion and control mechanism.<br /><br />Filter 1 has been largely eroded by this wonderful thing called the internet that has evolved since Manufacturing Consent was written. Now anyone can publish; thanks to (er... multinational corporations like) Google, anyone's views (even mine!) can be readily accessed, for better of for worse. The profit motive remains, but I don't think that having to print what the public wants to read is especially insidious, especially given how much the US public likes poorly conceived conspiracy theories. Nor should Chomsky, since that's what's made him a global superstar!<br /><br />Filters 2 and 4 are pretty unobjectionable, and wouldn't be news to anyone who spent more than a moment reflecting on what the media does in any community.<br /><br />Filter 3 ignores \\"official sources\\" includes things like  opposition political parties, competing businesses, public interest groups, consumer organisations, and dissident commentators of extraordinarily large pulling power like, well, Noam Chomsky.<br /><br />Filter 5 is comical. No reason is advanced for why anti-communism should be thought of as any more of a filter - let alone a \\"national religion\\" than anti-nazism, anti-racism, anti-muslim fundamentalist, pro-NRA, pro-abortion etc etc.<br /><br />The rest of the book comprises anecdotal evidence carefully selected by the authors to support their claims. As mentioned, I don't have much time for anecdotal evidence as a basis for making enormously sweeping generalisations, so I skipped them. Manfacturing Consent was a quick read, therefore.<br /><br />My advice would be to skip the book altogether, in fact.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonother \\"agents of power\\".    4: Public and official complaint on press content as a way of disciplining the media; and     5: Anti-communism as a national religion and control mechanism.

A very *interesting* (in the sense of the Middle Eastern curse) kettle of fish.<br /><br />I'm not sure what co-author Dubner's role is here - either to act as an alter ego for Levitt, allowing reproduction of fawning extracts from various newspaper articles written about Levitt throughout the book (as sole author Levitt wouldn't be able to get away with this without heaping hubris on his head), or perhaps to take the material he had from his original article and pad it out into a volume just fat enough (and no more) to justify publication as a hard-back, in which case Levitt had pretty much nothing to do with this book at all. I suspect a bit of both.<br /><br />Most of the few points made in this book are, at best, only moderately interesting, and there are very few of them: Freakonomics doesn't even remotely live up to its billing, managing only to explore the hidden side of about five completely discrete, and only moderately uninteresting, topics (statistical evidence that there's cheating in Sumo Wrestling, anyone?) Indeed, the sumo cheating data wasn't especially compelling: it seems to me there is an entirely innocent explanation for wrestlers who have already \\"qualified\\" losing an abnormally large number of bouts to statistically weaker fighters who have not: a \\"qualified\\" wrestler simply has no incentive to try particularly hard, where as a non-qualifying wrestler does. That analysis doesn't involve any collusion at all.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Levitt's theorems only really work where there are huge quantities of data covering all conceivable aspects of the topic at hand. Most of the time, this just isn't the case, which is why the hidden side of everything remains, even to Levitt and Dubner, hidden.<br /><br />In the cases where the data are available - like Baseball - others have done a much more compelling job of writing the economist's expose. For example, try Michael Lewis' outstanding Moneyball: the Art of Winning an Unfair Game.<br /><br />Mean time, this one joins Lynne Truss's Eats Shoots & Leaves as the latest in a long line of quick-buck publishing pan-flashes.<br /><br />Perhaps the money I've wasted on this book can be put, through this review, to some good use: saving yours.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonbr />Mean time, this one joins Lynne Truss's Eats Shoots & Leaves as the latest in a long line of quick-buck publishing pan-flashes. <br /> <br />Perhaps the money I've wasted on this book can be put, through this review, to some good use: saving yours. <br /> <br />Olly Buxton <br />	2005-08-10

In truth, I was prompted to buy Understanding Power - said to be a good collection of his works, having read, and been perplexed by, Chomsky's effusive praise of a less-than-convincing book about the nastiness of corporations (\\"The Corporation\\", by Joel Bakan.) I was curious as to how such a respected, academic, intelligent commentator could come to be praising such a bone-headed book.<br /><br />Well, I am curious no more.<br /><br />This is a nicely edited, packaged edition, which benefits from the fact that it seems to contain mostly transcripts of Socratic-style \\"teach-ins\\" (love-ins, more like) that Chomsky has conducted over the last few years. It's conversational and very easy to read: far from being weighed down by the carefully premeditated prose of a stuffy academic, Understanding Power positively zings with invective, humour, and oratory. Parts of it are funny (not always intentionally so), parts fascinating, Chomsky's command of the \\"received\\" facts of recent political history (and his self-declared \\"true\\" ones) is consistently impressive.<br /><br />Not only does this book give you a very clear exposition of Chomsky's perspective, it is very entertaining as it does it. Credit, therefore, to the editors who have presumably sifted through weeks of audio tape, and have cleaned up and contextualised to add to the reading pleasure. They've also compiled footnotes of greater length than the text, which are available for spods online.<br /><br />While his facts maybe impeccably marshalled, many of the conclusions at which Chomsky arrives - particular in the field of economics - are obviously baloney (it is basically conspiracy and paranoia writ on a scale even James Ellroy would baulk at) but it's maddeningly difficult to nail down exactly why. But this evening, in a taxi on the way home from my wage-slavery (ahem), on page 216, I nailed it: Chomsky's richest polemic is almost all unfalsifiable. There are no conceivable facts you could present to Chomsky that would lead him to say, \\"You know what? You're right! I've got this all completely wrong!\\" Arguing against Noam Chomsky would be like arguing against a born-again Christian. Facts are construed to fit the theory, and not the other way around.<br /><br />That quality - falsifiability - is what distinguishes valid argument from dogma. The fact that something is capable of being proven false is what gives it explanatory traction in the world. If a statement is true for all possible circumstances, it's either circular, tautological or it bears no relation to the world we live in.<br /><br />So when the stooges in his audience meekly suggest that his proposal for how to really manage an economy (namely: everyone pulls together and works towards the common good, no-one fights, no-one wants more than their fair share, everyone co-operates - utterly brilliant, isn't it?) has been tried in a few places, and it fell apart pretty quickly, Chomsky's retort is 'but that wasn't REALLY socialism! That was actually disguised CAPITALISM!' hence - objection is defined away, as opposed to being defended.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are still some glaring facts which Chomsky can't explain away: The most obvious is that if the media and corporate elites are so indoctrinated, so suppressive of \\"dissident\\" views like Chomsky's, then how can Chomsky himself have been such a roaring success? A search within Amazon on \\"Noam Chomsky\\" lists 536 books (ten times as many as for \\"Rush Limbaugh\\", five times as many as for \\"P J O'Rourke\\", and only 8 fewer than for \\"George Bush\\"!). Chomsky is a global superstar, an arch propagandist, a fantastic brand, and though he commends his disciples not to take his word for it, legions of them (most notably the slurpers who sit cross-legged at his feet in the pages of this book) simply do. No-one subjects his patter to sustained criticism - possibly because it is no more fun than arguing with a born-again Christian. I suspect what sticks in Chomsky's craw more than anything else isn't that he's suppressed by his political opponents - he simply isn't - it's that he's happily tolerated and, for the most part, ignored.<br /><br />And it's not really hard to see why. On one hand, Chomsky has little enough faith in the intellectual integrity of his common man to blame the prevalence of consumerism and capitalism on his brainwashing by the media and the corporate elite, but enough faith in it to suppose that some sort of anarcho-syndicalist communal form of existence for humankind is even remotely viable. He may well be right in his first assessment (but if they're happy, so what, actually?); the second is ludicrous. But it's the only solution he can come up with - such is the poverty of his constructive analysis. It is one thing to criticise, quite another to propose a constructive alternative - and I'm afraid consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning (if by that you don't mean naked capitalism, and trust me, Chomsky doesn't) just ain't it.<br /><br />Lest you think I'm exaggerating about Chomsky's skills as a propagandist, check out this little piece of disinformation: The dust jacket of Understanding Power quotes the New York Times as describing Chomsky as \\"arguably the most important intellectual alive\\". Well, if you read the book, you'll know that Chomsky is no fan of the New York Times, so I was surprised by this quote - surprised enough to Google on it to see if I could find the original. And I did: properly contextualised, it reads \\"...Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive today. He is also a disturbingly divided intellectual. On the one hand there is a large body of revolutionary and highly technical linguistic scholarship, much of it too difficult for anyone but the professional linguist or philosopher; on the other, an equally substantial body of political writings, accessible to any literate person but often maddeningly simple-minded\\".<br /><br />Haha, Professor Chomsky: Caught red-handed! *Now* who is \\"manufacturing consent\\"?<br /><br />At the end of the day, the most withering criticism of Noam Chomsky's political outlook comes not from the New York Times, but from the much-beloved satire on the anarcho-syndicalist peasant in Monty Python and the Holy Grail quoted in the title of this review.<br /><br />I must say, I tend to side with King Arthur's ultimate view, as he trudges away, bored and frustrated with totally pointless conversation.<br /><br />Python Afficionados will know what I mean.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br /><br />*******<br />Clarification: When reading the book I had assumed that Chomsky was some sort of cognitive relativist. I've since spent quite a lot of time reading around Chomsky, and it turns out that he's anything but: The linguistic \\"nativism\\" championed by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker is perhaps the last bastion of intellectual support for moral and cognitive objectivism, and this world view is apparent (ironically) in Chomsky's political writing. My fault: I guess I just couldn't credit that anyone still seriously advanced this perspective, especially from the Left.<br /><br />For when Chomsky says \\"seemingly unobjectionable state of affairs X is actually a malicious conspiracy Y\\", his criticism relies on the *falsehood* of explanation X and the *truth* of explanation Y. Cognitive relativism is no friend of Chomsky's at all: On the contrary, it undermines his position by saying that explanations X and Y are alternative descriptions of the same state of affairs, and *in the absence of data which are inconsistent with one or other explanation* ones subscription to one or the other is almost certainly a matter of historical contingency, and (*in the absence of contrary data*) there is no means of adjudicating between those explanations.<br /><br />Chomsky's explanations tend to rely on \\"hidden hands\\" (conspiracies between capitalists, government agencies and so forth) which are characterised by nothing so much as their lack of evidence - indeed, this very lack of evidence of conspiracy is often the \\"clincher\\" by which Chomsky claims the conspiracy must exist.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoncessible to any literate person but often maddeningly simple-minded\\".

Having declared the book closed on the Mind debate in \\"Consciousness Explained\\" (others are still offering odds) and having found beyond reasonable doubt for the Botanist in the case of Darwin vs. God in \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\", Daniel Dennett now purports to settle the third of the great metaphysical questions: Do we have free will? Not only that, indeed, but he purports - I think - to have found a method for achieving moral objectivity while he was at it. Good show, that man!<br /><br />Yes, I'm being a little ironic. But, for the most part, I'm a buyer: Dennett's books are certainly fascinating, and in large part compelling, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Just as there are similar strands between Consciousness Explained and Darwin's Dangerous Idea, there are some very familiar concepts here - old hands will recognise Conway's life world, the Prisoner's Dilemma, and Benjamin Libet's experiment which (seemed to) describe a \\"missing 300ms\\" between neural activity and consciousness of it - to the point where you might think to skip a few pages altogether.<br /><br />This would be a mistake, however, for a reason which nicely complements Dennett's own \\"multiple drafts\\" theory of consciousness: repeated examination of the same ideas, in a new context, and with the benefit of a refined explanation, affords the reader new perspectives, and enhances comprehension of this book, but also the earlier ones. In the case of Libet's experiment, Dennett is much more compelling in his counterarguments than in Consciousness Explained - the revised draft gives a better view of the point.<br /><br />What is so pleasing about all three books are the consistency of thoughts and ideas between them across what are at first glance disparate lines of inquiry - the  unifying meta-theory here is Darwin's - applied in quite different (but clearly related) contexts. Dennett extends the application of his arguments to some economic and quasi-political situations - everyday life, to you and me, where these questions actually matter - and gets mostly the right results. (It never fails to amaze me how highly intelligent, extremely well educated, university professors in social sciences fail to grasp even the basic tenets of economic theory, so it is a welcome sign that one of their number might do, especially one who once publicly struggled with the Laffer curve)<br /><br />I have two, related, complaints about Freedom Evolves. Of all the metaphysical conundrums, Free Will is - and ought to be - the least interesting, and most prone to catcalls from those in the cheap seats who think philosophy is wishy-washy, head-up-posterior, nonsense.<br /><br />Where consciousness has profound practical implications for our understanding of the world and how to live in it (not least in the field of AI); and whether God exists or not has profound implications for our sense of morality, the free will debate has neither feature: we all think we are free to choose; as a brute fact either we are or we're not: but either way, we can't change it (if we're not free, then we aren't free to change to be free; if we are free, we're not free to decide not to be). Whatever the answer is, it can't make any difference to the way we live out our lives, since whether we're free to choose begs the very question we're asking.<br /><br />That said, Dennett's Darwinian-influenced arguments are compelling in support of the case for free will.<br /><br />What isn't so compelling is the small part of the book in which he allows metaphysics to tip over into ethics. For the second book in a row, Dennett has made some unwelcome noises about sketching out some sort of theory of moral objectivity. He doesn't dwell on it, as such, but it is definitely there: writing elliptically, I think Dennett attempts to make a case for a sort of Moral Objectivism to be derived from evolution. He says, as his book draws to a close:<br /><br />\\"The philosopher's problem is to negotiate the transition from `is' to `ought', or more precisely to show how we might go beyond the `merely historical' fact that certain customs and policies have had, as a matter of fact, widespread societal endorsement, and get all the way to norms that command assent in all rational agents. Successful instances of this move are known. Bootstrapping has worked in the past, and it can work here as well. We don't need a skyhook.\\"<br /><br />I find this paragraph utterly baffling. It arrives so unannounced, and is so totally at odds with the very spirit and sense of everything else in Daniel Dennett's Darwin-influenced meta-theory, I just can't see what on earth possessed him to write it. What conceivable role could \\"norms commanding asset in all rational agents\\" in the gloriously unpredictable topography of the evolutionary journey possibly have?<br /><br />Dennett compares this to the process of obtaining a (virtually) perfect straightedge over centuries by continually refining our technique for making straighter and straighter straightedges - apparently missing the point that in the case of the straightedge there is an immutable, single, unmistakable, universally understood abstract concept of a \\"perfectly straight line\\" which the manufactured straightedge is aiming to achieve; as such, it could scarcely be different to describing norms generally agreed amongst poorly defined (and constantly mutating) communities of individuals which have been developed unsystematically over time in reaction to drastically shifting environmental and societal factors to regulate the behaviour of a community which itself is moving randomly through design space (i.e., evolving).<br /><br />Now, since when is transforming \\"is\\" to \\"ought\\" the philosopher's problem? Isn't the philosopher's job done when we can look at this wonderful model derived from Darwin's work, and say: Look, mum, no homunculus! No intelligent designer! No rules!<br /><br />Having knocked off the three main metaphyiscal conundrums, you wonder what might be next on the agenda - \\"Right and Wrong: Finally Sorted\\" perhaps?<br /><br />Olly Buxtonsition from `is' to `ought', or more precisely to show how we might go beyond the `merely historical' fact that certain customs and policies have had, as a matter of fact, widespread societal endorsement, and get all the way to norms that command assent in all rational agents.

Richard Dawkins has contributed some terrific ideas to the field of biology, evolution and the philosophy of mind and is a well-known advocate for a number of very sensible and sadly unsung positions in an age of new-age hooey and post-modernist balderdash. In times such as ours it is all the more important for people who speak common sense to be heard, and there are few common sense speakers with a higher profile than Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />While many of Dawkins' conclusions are laudable, his means of getting to some of them are not. Great physical scientists often make bad philosophers (witness Roger Penrose's embarrassing ramblings on the AI debate) and on the strength of these collected works, Dawkins falls squarely into this camp.<br /><br />Dawkins has a bee in his bonnet about two things: post-modernism/relativism and religion. As intellectual positions, relativist and religious thought tend not to have much in common, yet Dawkins is wholeheartedly agin them both. Make note of that irony, because irony is the order of the day.<br /><br />It is certainly easy enough to find examples of post-modernism to laugh at, and Dawkins indulges in some healthy banter of this sort. But the underlying premise on which relativism is based is sound: There *is* no such thing as \\"truth\\": our perception of the world *is* coloured by cultural and linguistic filters which mean that the same set of circumstances can present different \\"realities\\" to different observers. Whether Dawkins likes it or not, this isn't new age hooey.<br /><br />Curiously, Dawkins actually makes this very point in the context of a discussion on crystals intended to undermine the relativist cause: the atoms in a crystalline structure, he tells us, are relatively huge distances from each other, so by volume most of a crystalline structure is composed of nothing. Yet, thanks to evolution, we don't see it that way: \\"You might think that out sense organs would be shaped to give us a 'true' picture of the world as it 'really' is. It is safer to assume that they have been shaped to give us a *useful* picture of the world, to help us survive.\\" This inability to see the true picture, in Dawkins' very own example, has profound and (for a moral objectivist like Dawkins) unsettling implications for our world view.<br /><br />It doesn't undermine science, however; it simply converts science from a process which purports to provide indubitable truths about the universe to one which claims only to provide the best explanation for the data we have to hand. Again, in philosophical circles this is hardly controversial - it's a consequence of the inductive nature of empirical reasoning. As Dawkins himself notes, the practical difference between these two positions (\\"objective truth\\" vs. \\"best explanation we've got for the time being\\") is not always great, but as a perspective it distinguishes science from dogma. It may be vanishingly unlikely, as Dawkins claims, that anyone will falsify the tenets of cell biology - but they probably said that about Newton's laws of motion until fairly recently too.<br /><br />In rejecting all relativism, Dawkins comes across as extremely dogmatic. Given his views on religion, this is no small irony. Worse, it opens him - and, as its self-appointed spokesperson, science - to the now familiar criticism that science is just another religion, competing with creationism, and is no more defendable.<br /><br />That's a bad mistake. Even on a relativist reading, evolution is far more defendable (there's not any evidence which flatly contradicts evolution, whereas there's not much evidence that *doesn't* flatly contradict creationism) and, because thanks to his profile Dawkins is frequently read as a proxy for \\"the scientific community\\" he is doing his community a big disservice.<br /><br />As he is a committed atheist and evolutionist, I was surprised to read recently that Dawkins intended to vote Liberal Democrat (a left-of-centre political party in the UK) at the last election. I would have thought, of all people, Richard Dawkins would appreciate the elegance and efficiency of laissez-faire politics: it is laissez-faire biology, after all, which has provided us with this staggering universe; by contrast, Dawkins labels the creationist view \\"petty, small minded, parochial, unimaginative, unpoetic and downright boring compared to the staggering, mind expanding truth\\". Now a centrally planned economy, you would think, would tend to be similarly \\"parochial and small-minded\\" compared with an economy free to continually rejuvenate itself at the well-spring of supply and demand (and so, many economists would say, has been proven repeatedly in the last 90 years). But Dawkins cautions that to smell such an inconsistency or even contradiction would be a mistake: \\"there is no inconsistency in favouring Darwinism as an academic scientist while opposing it as a human being\\".<br /><br />Well, I'm not so sure about that. And I'm not so sure that Richard Dawkins' isn't a little too defensive about some of his other cherished beliefs, either.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonal Democrat (a left-of-centre political party in the UK) at the last election.

While it's a fantastically learned, well-read, and at times insightful entry on the subject, it encounters the same problems others like Joseph Campbell have: that that the facts of actual literature tend to sit uneasily with the unifying theory, and that the unifying theory itself tends to rest on an analysis of human psychology which sounds like it might be so much bunk, and a particular world view - moral objectivism - which definitely is.<br /><br />Both Jungian psychoanalysis and moral objectivity are taken as read by Christopher Booker and as such he spends no time justifying them (perhaps understandably - the arguments for and against each would fill this book many times over). Nonetheless, in my view, he's simply wrong about both of them, and it blows a Big Hole in his Big Idea.<br /><br />Booker's Big Idea is this: when you boil them down, there are only seven archetypal stories in all of literature, and further that if you boil those archetypes down, they are in many ways the same story viewed from different perspectives. This is perhaps intuitively understandable: in the broadest sense all stories are a variation of \\"there once was a problem, and it got resolved\\" - but the kicker is this: Booker asserts that any story which fails to follow his prescription is - objectively - flawed. Now that sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it.<br /><br />The first observation to make is that this significantly undermines his claim to have found a unifying theory: Suddenly, it's not all literature that follows the archetype, but all *good* literature. As a moral objectivist, that doesn't seem to Booker like much of a concession, but from any other perspective it is: what Booker is saying is that all literature *which he likes* meets one of the seven archetypes. What seemed to be a bold assertion about the nature of literature is instead a simple indictment of Booker's appreciation of it.<br /><br />That seems more plausible, anyway: the point and content of a story, you would think, cannot be straight-jacketed in this way. The fact that popular stories tend to have similarities speaks to our cultural heritage, the common dilemmas of life and death we share, and perhaps to our lack of imagination, not to some cosmic rule of fiction. This has been borne out in more \\"enlightened\\" times (literally - since the enlightenment), as Booker notes to his dismay that these similarities have tended to fade. But even without that modern interference, Booker notes that the seven archetypes tend to fragment under the weight of closer analysis - there are \\"dark inversions\\" of each, and inversions of various characters. So, the seven become fourteen or more.<br /><br />The second problem is that, as mentioned, the last couple of centuries have seen stories fail more and more to keep to the archetypes. Booker blames this on romanticism, and is required by his theory to claim that these divergent stories are intrinsically flawed. That might not be a problem were these flawed stories not to include almost all the classics of modern literature, except perhaps Lord of the Rings and the Narnia chronicles (both of which, quelle surprise, have a fundamentally Christian, and therefore morally objectivist, subtext).<br /><br />So, you can write off Melville, Nabokov, Balzac, Lawrence, Stoker and Shelley, or write off Booker's theory.<br /><br />For me, it isn't a difficult choice.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonpes.

The rather silly cover of his book on the subject belies what is in fact a thorough, erudite, dispassionate and compelling account of the rise of Radical Islam, of which \\"Al Qaeda\\" - in its strict sense - is really only a small part.<br /><br />Burke has spent a number of years in various Islamic hot spots (Saudi, Afghanistan, Kurdish Iraq) and has apparently the spent the most of the last four years doing his homework. The account he sets out (which really ought not to be a surprise to anyone but the Neo-Conservatives) is that Islamic militancy is not centrally controlled; there is no \\"head of the snake\\" except the one Western foreign policy has created in Osama bin Laden. For nothing has assisted fundamentalism as a rallying point for (the in reality mostly social and political) discontent in the Islamic word than his vilification by Messrs Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and their friends. Indeed, Burke's case is that before the Western Hawks began targeting it, Islamic militancy was, amongst its own constituents, all but dead in the water.<br /><br />Burke is convincing in his arguments that Al-Qaeda *the actual organisation* was never more than a hard-core of twenty or thirty militants, was not more than indirectly associated with many of the terrorist acts attributed to them, and was dispersed, incapacitated and in large part eliminated after the war in Afghanistan. But Al Qaeda *the idea* - which is the creation of western conservative political classes - has spread virus-like amongst the Islamic world, and is a much more threatening spectacle. Ideas are a whole lot harder to kill off than individuals.<br /><br />In laying the groundwork for his thesis Burke is obliged to engage with a lot of minutiae of the history of Islamic dissent (every bit-player in the last twenty years gets a mention), and this part of the book is somewhat heavy going, though it certainly leads gravitas: without it, Burke would be open to criticism for a lack of thoroughness.

Many indeed are the fruit of Campbell's tree.<br /><br />In The Hero With A Thousand Faces Campbell sets out his stall early: his \\"monomyth\\" which is explained in fairly short order, and supported in more depth over the rest of the book by Campbell's account of hundreds instantiations of it embodied in myths from the Judaeo-Christian, Classical, Native American, Indian, African, Asian and Polynesian traditions. It is even illustrated, rather pointlessly, with sculptures and depictions of these various myths.<br /><br />This means it's a fairly quick read: it is Campbell's argument that is interesting, not his field research in support of it, and his stentorian and humourless tone in recounting the legends is no incentive to dwell on them.<br /><br />Campbell's main claim - to have extracted a solitary narrative essence common to all mythology - is unsustainable: even if you do allow the tortured interpretations Campbell makes of the myths he cites, the best that can be said is that any one of the dozen or more common features of the \\"monomyth\\" tend to show up in his examples (who knows whether they do in the myths he *doesn't* cite?); to say that they all do is false, even on the evidence Campbell presents in his book. And many of his examples don't fit comfortably into the roles which Campbell assigns them.<br /><br />So in that regard, Campbell's thesis needs to be watered down to have any real value. As do the courage of his convictions in the validity of psychoanalysis: treating Freud and Jung as gospel in this day and age seems more than a little quaint.<br /><br />But that's not to say there isn't something to be said for the importance of the subconscious in what makes a good story, nor that the elements of the \\"monomyth\\" do appear in mythology, nor that they don't make a great foundation for a mythology. Cogent evidence or that last point is provided by Messrs Wachowski and Lucas, who have openly used Campbell's template to create latter day myths of their - and, like it or not, our - own.<br /><br />Where Campbell is persuasive is that myth a metaphor on which we can examine ourselves, and that as soon as we mistake metaphor for a genuine explanatory hypothesis, its very usefulness evaporates. In the current political climate, this is a point which can't be stressed enough.<br /><br />In summary, this ought to be compulsory reading for any aspiring screenplay writer or novelist, and will be food for thought for anyone else interested in the structure of fiction. The Hero With A Thousand Faces may be the wrong side of fifty now, but it is no relic: as long as the likes of Luke Skywalker and Neo are part of the zeitgeist, Joseph Campbell's theories will have some significance in our culture, for better or for worse, for some time to come.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonay there isn't something to be said for the importance of the subconscious in what makes a good story, nor that the elements of the \\"monomyth\\" do appear in mythology, nor that they don't make a great foundation for a mythology.

Daniel Dennett's excellent book Consciousness Explained extracts a very funny cartoon from Scientific American, in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra. In the middle of the formula appears the sentence, \\"THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS\\". One professor points to the statement and says to the other, \\"I think you should be more explicit here in step two.\\"<br /><br />Roger Penrose isn't just any old boffin: he is the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University and has been knighted for his services to Science. The Emperor's New Mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut, the Consciousness/Artificial Intelligence problem. Penrose's view is that Strong AI is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate (functionally or actually) what we know as \\"consciousness\\".<br /><br />Right. Take a deep breath here. For it's a scary thing for a mere mortal (with a decidedly ordinary bachelor's degree in the humanities) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet, but I can't see any way around it: In this book Roger Penrose completely, totally, misses the point. Insofar as it's considered an entry on the Consciousness/AI debate, The Emperor's New Mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless.<br /><br />There. I said it.<br /><br />Then again, nearly 500 of those pages don't even purport to be about consciousness, so perhaps all is not lost. Instead, they contain an extremely dense, at times fascinating, but uniformly (and I use the word deliberately) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics, physics and cosmology. While Penrose thinks it is necessary background, it isn't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority:<br /><br />One is left with the firm impression that the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is a very, very smart chap, and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes. This is no small irony, given the title of his book. For if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see, it's Roger Penrose.<br /><br />Here's where I think he goes wrong. Firstly, his attempt to undermine the AI position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning. Pure mathematics is a closed logical system. Its truths aren't falsifiable, so by themselves have no explanatory force. Mathematical statements (such as \\"1+1=2\\") are necessarily true for all time and all universes so, ipso facto, they can't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe. Yet that is just what Penrose asks them to do. He invokes G&ouml;del's theorem of undecidability, perhaps to counter the argument I have just made, but it isn't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set (even though you know they are true) is very different from being able to falsify them. Without that power, you have no explanatory traction in the outside world.  Penrose's entire attack on Strong AI is based on an unfalsifiable, and therefore non-content carrying, argument.<br /><br />Another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used, and must work perfectly to be of any use. Natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case. An algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products, and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level: take Newtonian mechanics as a good example. We've known for a century it isn't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point: for all the learning Penrose includes on Mandelbrot sets, phase space, entropy and Hawking Radiation, The Emperor's New Mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out: The bibliography contains no reference to Karl Popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/AI question: Daniel Dennett is barely mentioned (Dennett's writing probably represents the \\"forefront\\" of the consciousness debate), nor is Richard Dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection. Indeed, Penrose doesn't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong AI, but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day, and that AI doesn't present a significant challenge. Douglas Hofstadter is given a little space, and John Searle and his largely discredited Chinese Room Experiment a fair space, but other than that the only philosopher Penrose seems to be aware of is Plato.<br /><br />Another thinker Penrose doesn't seem familiar with is William of Occam. Instead of doing some background reading (and applying a little common sense), Penrose has launched a theory which (as he proudly proclaims) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain (in ways he freely admits he doesn't understand) an everyday, prosaic (but still extremely hard to grasp) phenomenon. In its interstellar journey Penrose's theory drifts very close to dualism, and close (but not quite so close, perhaps) to positing (or needing) some sort of God to work. That will give succour in some quarters, but not the ones Penrose has in mind, I suspect.<br /><br />Occam's Razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available. Penrose would protest there are none; Dennett, Dawkins, Hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents (including me) would beg to differ, and point to a lot of literature that Penrose hasn't read. In any case one would think that Penrose's own intuition (which he claims helps him to see truth despite G&ouml;del undecidability!) ought to help him see his theory is, as Jeremy Bentham would say, \\"nonsense on stilts\\".<br /><br />Ultimately, when Penrose says \\"quantum theory explains consciousness\\" he is really saying no more than \\"something magic happens!\\" or even \\"THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS\\".<br /><br />Mr Penrose, I think you should be more explicit here in step two.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonght have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/AI question: Daniel Dennett is barely mentioned (Dennett's writing probably represents the \\"forefront\\" of the consciousness debate), nor is Richard Dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection.

The literary fame of its author, Colin Wilson, has not lasted the thirty odd years since his \\"The Outsider\\" (not to be confused with Camus' existential masterpiece) was an overnight success, and I suppose that on its publication around that time, and with such a tail wind, this book might have carried more gravitas than it does now. As it is, Colin Wilson currently resides in the \\"Where Are They Now?\\" file, whereas the dozens of authors from the last three hundred years of literature whose novelistic failings he savagely decries, decidedly do not.<br /><br />It is Wilson's considered view, you see, that Joyce, Hemingway and Balzac were muddled thinkers; Maupassant didn't think at all, Hesse was unsatisfactory, Balzac unsatisfying, Beckett saddled with faulty artistic logic, Huxley and Lawrence were experimental novelists who have really added nothing new. And that's just scratching the surface. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Camus, Proust, HG Wells, Dickens all come in for similar treatment, and poor old James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway in particular, get pages and pages of it.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Wilson has arbitrarily defined the purpose of a novel in a way that suits him, but that doesn't seem to bear any relation to any generally understood view. So either he's setting up a straw man, or his definitions are intended to be interpreted so loosely that they don't really say anything at all. I suspect the latter: his various formulations seems like so much pseudo-intellectual hog-wash to me:<br /><br />\\"The novel is the embodiment of what Kierkegaard meant by existential philosophy. It is an attempt to demonstrate clearly the outcome of certain attitudes to life.\\"<br /><br />\\"The aim of the novelist to produce wide-angle consciousness\\"<br /><br />\\"The novel is a thought experiment, which aims to explore human freedom\\"<br /><br />\\"The writer's sense of meaning - the things he loves and values - must be *exactly* counterbalanced by the things he hates or rejects.<br /><br />\\"The basic law of the novel is Newton's third law of motion: that every action should have an equal and opposite reaction\\"<br /><br />This is all either wrong, or meaningless. Yet without irony, he accuses his elders and betters of crimes he's guilty of himself: Of Ulysses, he remarks \\"...unfortunately this also involved a biased and highly personal view of the purpose of art\\".<br /><br />Hmmm. Pot, Kettle?<br /><br />As this treatise progresses is gets ever more bizarre. At one point we're told that all works of literature can be judged according to a scale how far they share the \\"communal life-world\\", which marks the bottom of a scale, a \\"Highly Individual Life-world\\" marking the middle of the scale and \\"Purely Objective Vision\\" marking the top.<br /><br />What does this mean? Search me.<br /><br />His broad assertions become more and more weird: \\"language falsifies reality\\" he tells us (but not Wittgenstein, I suspect); \\"the Language of mathematics allows us to explore the mathematical truths of our universe\\"; and the Ancient Greeks who preserved the oral tradition of Homer (yes, them - the ones behind algebra, geometry, mathematics, politics, philosophy, sculpture etc etc) were \\"savage, scarcely literate people\\".<br /><br />It is truly difficult to know what on earth to make of this.<br /><br />Wilson does have some good words to say on a couple of obscure fantasy writers from the 20th century (David Lindsay and John Cowper Powys, who respectively produced \\"the greatest imaginative work of the 20th century - possibly in all literature\\" and a prophetic novel that \\"surpasses Eliot, Melville or Dostoyevsky\\"), and Tolkien: presciently he intones: \\"It is conceivable then, that future generations will see The Lord Of The Rings as the cultural watershed of the 20th Century\\".<br /><br />Curiously Herman Melville gets scarcely a mention, while Bram Stoker gets none at all.<br /><br />Ultimately I suspect thisis all just more evidence that \\"The Craft of the Novel\\" was an artefact of its time, and not one that bears reading thirty years down the line. That's another way of saying this book is, and was, unmitigated rubbish.<br /><br />But for all that, in a strange way, I enjoyed it. It certainly has given me some fresh reading tips (I'm going to give Powys and Lindsay a try) and there was something curiously enjoyable about being so infuriated by the silly remarks!<br /><br />An extra star for luck, therefore.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br /> <br />Ultimately I suspect this is all just more evidence that \\"The Craft of the Novel\\" was an artefact of its time, and not one that bears reading thirty years down the line.

US	52000095	R1J1BB7ONCX8N8	0316180661	358661477	Consciousness Explained	Books	5	32	38	N	N	And then a miracle occurred	Consciousness Explained is a hard, but very rewarding, book. I first read it five years ago, and thought I mostly got it, but on reflection, I realise now I probably didn't. After recently getting through Dennett's equally fascinating (and hard) \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" I read it again. It's properly sinking in now, and I think I mostly have it. I think.<br /><br />If you're considering reading Consciousness Explained, I recommend having a look at Darwin's Dangerous Idea first; some of the ideas Dennett expounds there, particularly on the nature of algorithmic progression, are extremely useful for getting a handle on Dennett's central theme in Consciousness Explained. Dennett's views in each are really quite closely related. However, the \\"intuitive gap\\" (i.e., the distance in credibility between what Dennett proposes and how things \\"seem\\" intuitively) is huge in the case of consciousness, but comparatively small for Evolution. To wit:<br /><br />Consciousness: Intuitively, there's a \\"central meaner\\" in the brain sitting in a \\"Cartesian theatre\\" enjoying the son-et-lumi&egrave;re. Dennett says this is an illusion, and there is no \\"narrative centre\\" of consciousness at all - in not so many ways, consciousness itself is an illusion; an aggregation of multiple sensory inputs and outputs of the cerebellum, all of which are performing their own functions independently of each other. \\"BUT AN ILLUSION TO WHOM?\\" you want to scream.  It just doesn't seem to make sense.<br /><br />Evolution: Intuitively, the universe seems designed. It seems impossible that it could be the result of blind, unintelligent operations. Darwin says that this is nevertheless the case, through the algorithmic mechanism of reproduction, mutation and natural selection of multiple organisms performing their own functions independently of each other. This isn't such a stretch, especially as the notion of a designer of the universe is an even more problematic idea, when you give it a moment's thought.<br /><br />And that's precisely the point. Dennett argues persuasively (as, of course, many have before him) that a Cartesian theatre is just such a preposterous idea as a designer of the universe. Once you've ruled it out, all you are left with is the mechanical functions of the brain (unless, with Roger Penrose, you want to say \\"Quantum Mechanics did it!\\"), so you don't have any choice in the matter: the only question is how to build these mechanical, independent operations up into something which can function like consciousness. Like evolution, an aggregation of algorithms can be a \\"crane\\" which can achieve more than a simple algorithm. And so on. When you account for the actual - heterophenomenological, if I may be so bold - quality of consciousness, you notice it's incomplete, it's bitty, it's missing stuff: it isn't quite the widescreen, 7.1 THX certified surround-sound audio-visual experience we think it is, which is all grist to Dennett's mill.<br /><br />Dennett is open that this is an opening salvo rather than a complete theory, and I am very interested to find out where this has all led. To my mind too much time is spent on stimulus and response - qualia, visual images and the like - which ought to be comparatively easy to explain in terms of multiple drafts - and not enough time is spent explaining how on Dennett's theory a human being, who only *seems* to have consciousness, can create clearly intentional objects, such as this book review, or more critically, a book as coherent and persuasive as Dennett's. It is difficult to analyse this sort of intentional action without a \\"central meaner\\" to be putting the view. I think Dennett's view might be able to be developed in this direction, but to my mind insufficient resource was put into this endeavour.<br /><br />As he does in Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Daniel Dennett courts controversy and seems to pick intemperate fights with his competitors, and you do wonder whether a few straw men aren't being erected. Certainly, there is the odd cheap shot, but that adds to the entertainment value - the idea of fully grown philosophers drawing handbags at forty paces is one which appeals to me, and Dennett's views on his major competitor John Searle have this quality.<br /><br />But John Searle should perhaps take some comfort: Dennett may at times seem abrasive, but he surely doesn't *mean* to be.<br /><br />If you know what I mean.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoned.

I didn't get the joke about Ceramic Art, and if all Bo Fowler wanted to say was \\"People matter more than the Truth\\" he could have picked any number of more effective ways of saying it (a six word poem, for example).<br /><br />The central premise around which Fowler constructs his tale - a wise guy profiteering out of silly people putting hard money on improvable things - is a nice idea for a short story, or a joke, but it can't sustain the sort of close examination it gets in a full novel. Some of the surrounding surrealism (such as the narrator being an artificially intelligent shopping trolley who climbs Mt. Everest) had no obvious point, other than the sight gag. And how I laughed.<br /><br />Fowler's beef is with religion. It's definitely fair game, but it seems to me to be an easy enough target for satire without the need for this level of absurdity, and that undermines the force of the (otherwise sensible, if Philosophy 101-derived) criticisms Fowler wants to make. As a result Scepticim Inc. won't rescue anyone from under the spell of fundamentalism, and it won't do more than prove a few belly-laughs for the already saved.<br /><br />The humour is a little self-satisfied, though there are some nice lines - the best (like \\"there's a Messiah born every minute\\") did actually make me laugh out loud - but Fowler tends to beat his darlings to death, and so even though it's a short and easy read, you have the sense it could profitably have been much shorter still, without losing anything of significant value. Still, a nice try for a first novel from a guy who did a creative writing course at University.<br /><br />In fact, that pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Olly Buxton	2004-08-12

In many ways, I wish I had read Darwin's Dangerous Idea first, for the premises on which Dennett's account of consciousness are based are set out here in a great deal of depth. I don't think I fully \\"got\\" Consciousness Explained first time, so I am going to read it again now. After I've read a cheap and trashy thriller first, as a treat for being so good.<br /><br /> As you progress through Darwin's Dangerous Idea, having unequivocally lost the ideas of God and a \\"soul\\", a further order of things which are very central to civilisation as we know it start to collapse as well, most notably the ideas that there are external concepts of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" at all.<br /><br /> Throughout the first three quarters of the book, Dennett is thoroughly persuasive, with the assistance of Richard Dawkins' wonderful idea of the \\"meme\\" (which is a great meme in itself); the idea which reproduces itself and mutates within and between human brains: Just as organisms do, \\"fit\\" memes find currency and reproduce with ease; and \\"weak\\" memes aren't able to occupy enough brains, and eventually die out.<br /><br /> It is analogies like these that display the power of the idea: the Darwinist meme has outgrown biology and is finding application (for which read: reproducing and mutating) in epistemology, ethics, sociology, economics and pretty much every other academic discipline when you stop to think about it. The implications for this, as a unificatory theory of everything, are immense.<br /><br /> Having said all this, Darwin's Dangerous Idea is not without its faults.<br /><br /> At times Dennett is needlessly provocative, and skirts dangerously close to ad hominem arguments in his dismissal of certain competing commentators, most notably Stephen Jay Gould. By being so he gives the impression of not being dispassionate (apologies, by the way, for the double negative, but I mean something different to &quot;passionate&quot;!) about the subject at hand. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it leads a sceptical reader to question how fairly opposing arguments may have been set out: unless one has read the competing works (and I certainly haven't) for all we know, Dennett may be rendering straw men or at least underselling the points lined up against him.<br /><br /> More curiously, having already picked fights with the religious, the spiritualists and the Marxist biologists, rather late in the piece Dennett wades into the ethics debate. He might have been better advised to leave morality for another time. His final two chapters purport to apply the \\"universal acid\\" of Darwinism to ethics. You would expect this to be a rout, but after noting (quite correctly) that between them such great minds as Hobbes, Mill, Kant and Rawls failed utterly to formulate any sort of method for adjudicating right and wrong, Dennett reaches not the obvious conclusion that there is no such thing (which seems to me to be the plain implication of everything the evolutionary theory stands for), but instead puts failures of moral judgment down to insufficient information at the time of judgment formation (one never knows *all* the facts, so one can't be expected to get it right) and ventures the suggestion that there is an evolutionarily explicable moral code, but we just can't always access it.<br /><br /> It is not clear why he even thinks this is necessary, especially since the very lesson of evolutionary biology is that it's quite possible for something extremely clever to come about by a concatenated series of not very clever steps. If this is enough to get humans from protoplasm to cave man, I couldn't fathom what Dennett's interest was in defending the notion that from cave man forwards, humans have needed some externally derived conduct code, especially when the one thing which is undeniable from recorded history is that that competing civilisations have never progressed their cause by being nice to each other. The final two chapters in my view can therefore be skipped without significant loss.<br /><br /> All in all, and notwithstanding these minor grumbles, I think this is an extremely valuable and thought-provoking book.<br /><br /> Olly Buxtonhim.  <br />  <br /> More curiously, having already picked fights with the religious, the spiritualists and the Marxist biologists, rather late in the piece Dennett wades into the ethics debate.

It is good meaty, controversial stuff. I couldn't give a fig whether it's true or not, to be honest, as long as it gets up the nose of the religious authorities, which apparently it has. Kudos to Mr. Brown for that.<br /><br />But the thriller? Dear, oh dear. There's not one element of it that passes muster.<br /><br />Firstly, the characterisation is astoundingly weak - so weak that it completely undermines the unfolding plot.  The gating question Dan Brown fails to answer is this: why would a four-by-two, dull-as-ditchwater university beak, actually do any of this?<br /><br />Next, the dialogue throughout is awful (a large contributor to the woodenness of the characterisation) and about three of the characters seem to \\"chime\\" everything rather than saying it. Grrr.<br /><br />Then the plot, however you look at it, is plain ridiculous. We asked to believe that, among other things (NB the following aren't really spoilers):<br /><br />* pillar-of-respectability Robert Langdon, a world-renowned Harvard professor of symbolism, before even informally being accused of a crime he manifestly could not have committed, would seek to run from local judicial police (instead of co-operating with their inquiries) to the extent of (among other things) hot-wiring an armoured truck, breaking through police lines in a borrowed Range Rover and fleeing French airspace in an illegally chartered plane.<br /><br />* the murder victim's grand-daughter Sophie - estranged from said victim for ten years (as a result of witnessing him participate in a bizarre sex cult) and a complete stranger to Langdon, herself an employee of the French Police's cryptology department to boot (convenient, eh wot?) - would be the prime mover in Langdon's decision to do, and his main accomplice in doing, this, thus (one would think) completely obliterating her own career in public service in the process for the sake of a dead man she manifestly thought was a pervert.<br /><br />* on the run from the French judicial police (as well as a rather nasty bovver boy from Vatican hardliners Opus Dei), said professor would frequently stop and deliver lengthy homilies to said granddaughter about L. Da Vinci, the Priory of Sion, the Merovingian Kings, the Knights Templar and all the other usual suspects of Christian legend.<br /><br />* The point of the pair's flight from justice is apparently not to prove Langdon's innocence, nor solve the actual murder themselves, but instead to find - on this night, of all nights - documentary proof of the last resting place of the most Holy Grail itself.<br /><br />* that this, along with all other action in the novel (and there's plenty more, you may rest assured) takes place in the course of one uninterrupted evening. About four lines in the novel suggest that Sophie and Robert may also get it on. What a busy pair!<br /><br />Now I know fiction is all about the suspension of disbelief, but this is ridiculous. We are introduced to an increasingly ludicrous array of plot-functional characters as the drama goes on, whilst Brown spoon feeds his hysterical theories of Christian cover-ups, secret societies and hidden symbols by way of unsolicited authorial essay, pompous soliloquy (usually delivered, as noted, in the teeth of approaching police and/or bovver boys), or straight-out travelogue. There are pages of The Da Vinci Code that read like [[ASIN:0312385811 Let's Go Paris]].<br /><br />Where the opportunity really knocked was to fold the symbolism Brown has researched into the text of the novel itself. This is what sets apart the likes of Umberto Eco - real skill in the craft of writing. None is in evidence here. There is no figurative structure at all, which is remarkable for a book all about hidden codes, so it is really a straight out holiday page-turner.<br /><br />Which is why the masses like it, and have bought it in their droves: The Da Vinci Code is a dead easy read, but one can feel the achievement of having read (and understood!) a book described on its cover as \\"erudite\\".<br /><br />Makes me sound like a snob, doesn't it?<br /><br />So be it.<br /><br />Olly Buxton312385811 Let's Go Paris]].

Nonetheless, I found this to be a fascinating book, and have been recommending it to everyone I meet. It contains a fundamental truth of investing that anyone could use, useful precisely because most people (like the low-scoring reviewers on this site) think they know best.<br />If every armchair sports fans thinks they know better than the others, it stands to reason that most of them are wrong.<br />The fact that the Oakland A's never won the world series is absolutely not the point. If the market was functioning efficiently, on their budget, they should never have got within cooey of it: The buying power of behemoths like the Mets should have ensured that. What is remarkable - and what is important - is that the A's consistently, massively, exceeded their own expectations.<br />Sport is a business. I mean that figuratively as well as literally: profit can be measured in dollar terms but also in percentage of wins to losses. Fans seem to forget that. In business, consistently exceeding expectations is an even better thing than winning the World Series, because it necessarily means you've made MONEY. If you're the favourite and you win the World Series, you have only met expectations, and you may even have made a loss.<br />If baseball were a perfect market, it wouldn't be possible to exceed expectations over a long period. Over a few games, maybe - that could be a fluke. Over two seasons, it almost certainly couldn't be. That means two things: (a) conventional wisdom about the value of certain baseball players and certain attributes is wrong; and (b) The Oakland A's have worked out what is right, or at any rate their model is better than the conventional wisdom.<br />This is the sort of thing Billy Beane should have kept as quiet about as possible. Michael Lewis' book ought to be a Eureka moment for every baseball manager: if it is, then the market mis-pricing will disappear, everyone will acquire players on the strength of the new valuation methodology and the Oakland A's will gradually fall down the rankings to where they should have been in the first place, given their budget. I dare say that has already started to happen.<br />What it ought to do is open eyes of managers from other codes, and indeed other businesses: The key is in having sufficient data. If you have enough good quality data (like baseball does) then if your analysis of it is better than your competitors, then as long as your approach is disciplined and consistent, you will, over time, turn a virtually risk free profit. It's called arbitrage.<br />I haven't even got onto the fact that Michael Lewis is one of the most insightful and witty writers writing in business at the moment, and this book is a pleasure to read from start to finish, notwithstanding my ignorance of its subject. I have read a number of business titles recently, and compared to the rest of the pack Lewis is, if you'll excuse the pun, a major leaguer amongst amateurs.<br />Highly, highly recommended.<br />Olly Buxtoning will disappear, everyone will acquire players on the strength of the new valuation methodology and the Oakland A's will gradually fall down the rankings to where they should have been in the first place, given their budget.

I think this is the mistake: Science Fiction at its heart is a poular, pulp sort of genre, no amount of post facto rationalisation will alter the fact that it is Lucas and Spielberg who are the backbone of (cinematic) Science Fiction, not Kubrick and Tarkovsky.<br />It's a very heavy (physically as well as textually), long winded book. Having completed the first three or four chapters (in which Edgar Allen Poe gets a somewhat surprisingly extended mention) I have given up on the project of reading Trillion Dollar Spree from cover to cover, and now intend to use to dip into from time to time instead. Or, at any rate, just to stick on the bookshelf, comforted in the knowledge that it's there and I *can* dip into it from time to time, if I feel like it.<br />Olly Buxton	2004-04-25
US	52000095	R3QVN110DGZ1Z1	1592400876	436381860	Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation	Books	2	1026	1515	N	N	It's not clever and it's not funny	It is a good thing that a book on punctuation is a best-seller; it's just a pity it's this one.<br /><br />All the good work Lynne Truss does in conveying her message (viz., punctuation matters) is undone by her hectoring tone, dismal attempts at humour (made worse by a tendency to point out the punch-lines) and, in the final analysis, lack of credibility: having set out rules she then reverses over them, makes egregious appeals to authority and, every now and then, just gets things flat out wrong.<br /><br />You might forgive that were there any humility in her prose, but there isn't. The first rule of hubris is: if you're going to be a clever-clogs, make sure you're right, because readers won't cut you any slack if you're not.<br /><br />Lynne Truss isn't always right.<br /><br />A case in point: in her introduction, Truss states (rather presumptuously) on behalf of her fellow sticklers, \\"we got very worked up after 9/11 not because of Osama bin-Laden but because people on the radio kept saying \\"enormity\\" when they meant \\"magnitude\\", and we hate that\\".<br /><br />Now ignoring the curious impression this creates of Truss's value scheme, she is quite wrong to take umbrage here: \\"Enormity\\", in British English, means \\"extreme wickedness\\". The magnitude and the awfulness of an act of mass murder are closely correlated. So, even in British English, it is perfectly right to talk of the \\"enormity\\" of September 11. But if any of the voices Truss heard on the radio were American, they had another excuse. In American English enormity *does* mean \\"magnitude\\". Since Truss is so enamoured with appeals to authority, it is odd she didn't check that with the best authority on American English, Webster's dictionary. I should mention that I read English edition of this book. Given Truss's proclivities as regards the cultural heathen, it will be interesting to see whether her American sub-editors pluck up enough courage to point this out.<br /><br />When she does make them, Truss's appeals to authority are even more irritating, particularly where they contradict her own rules or justify her own errors: So, the author patiently explains that an apostrophe is required to indicate possession except in the case of a possessive pronoun (i.e., \\"mine\\", \\"yours\\", \\"his\\", \\"hers\\", \\"its\\", \\"ours\\" and \\"theirs\\"). Now, I had always wondered why a possessive \\"its\\" doesn't have an apostrophe, and this explains it nicely. But then Truss completely undermines her own rule and appeals to the authority of Virginia Woolf:<br /><br />\\"Someone wrote to say that my use of \\"one's\\" was wrong (\\"a common error\\"), and that it should be \\"ones\\". This is such rubbish that I refuse to argue about it. Go and tell Virginia Woolf it should be \\"A Room of Ones Own\\" and see how far you get.\\"<br /><br />Virginia Woolf's been dead for over fifty years, so this is pretty tough to do. But it doesn't mean Virginia Woolf was right. And Truss fails explain why this is \\"such rubbish\\".<br /><br />Finally, even the book's title betrays the author's questionable sense of humour. I don't think she gets the joke. It has nothing to do with waiters or pistols (perhaps a maiden aunt told her that one?) and certainly doesn't need a \\"badly punctuated wildlife manual\\" to work, because it isn't a grammatical play; it's an oral one. The joke doesn't work when you write it down, precisely because of the ambiguous comma. You have to say it out loud (in spoken English, there is no punctuation at all).<br /><br />I hope they re-title the New Zealand edition of this book, because the local version of the joke (which employs a delightful expression from NZ English) is funnier: The Kiwi, it is said, is the most anti-social bird in the bush, and no-one likes to invite it to parties, because, if it turns up at all, it just eats roots and leaves.<br /><br />The joke's about shagging, Lynne.<br /><br />********<br />POSTSCRIPT<br />1 September 2008: After more than four years, I am finally out of my misery: a correspondent, C. Elder, has kindly explained why \\"one's\\" should indeed take an apostrophe: Mr(s). Elder writes:<br /><br />\\"It is only personal possessive pronouns (mine, his, her, our, etc) that do not take apostrophes. \\"One\\" is an indefinite pronoun, so using it in the possessive sense ... it takes an apostrophe, and hence why we ought not torture Ms Woolf in her grave.\\"<br /><br />So there you have it.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoner writes:    \\"It is only personal possessive pronouns (mine, his, her, our, etc) that do not take apostrophes. \\"One\\" is an indefinite pronoun, so using it in the possessive sense ... it takes an apostrophe, and hence why we ought not torture Ms Woolf in her grave.\\"     So there you have it.

I'd never heard of Reed Arvin, and were it not for Harper Collins' largesse, there is no way on Earth I would have come to be reading this book.<br />Observation: as at the date of writing, there are 24 reviews posted of this novel, 15 of which (including the first eleven by date) are posted by Amazon Top 1000 Reviewers. Given that there are something like half a million Amazon customer reviewers, for a second novel by a largely unknown author, this strikes me as either an extraodinary co-incidence, or cogent evidence that these Top 1000 reviewers know something the rest of the world doesn't. Perchance they, too, only came to be reading because Harper Collins sent them the book? I suspect I'm off HarperCollins' free books mailing list for noting this, especially if I'm wrong, but there you go - sometimes you bite the hand that feeds.<br />As for the book itself, well, it's not that The Last Goodbye a bad book - it isn't. It's just that it really isn't that *good*.<br />Arvin tries to do too much with too little material. This is five books' worth of ideas fighting for dominance in a single story: there's gitty urban realism (for which read drugs, race, incest etc.); gumshoe PI noir; evil pharmaceutical company hi-jinks and japery; a new-economy techie computer-hacker angle, Grisham-esque courtroom drama, operatic exposition and theatrical intrigue and last but not least dotcom era IPO mania (complete with corporate jets) elbowing each other to get to what is really a pretty short and understaffed bar.<br />So it was always going to end up in a fight, and Arvin was alsway going to be the one needing to be taken away to get his face fixed up.<br />There are other technical issues. The writing is not as disciplined as it could be (though Arvin is certainly funny at times). Dialogue is frequently contrived. Even simple parts of the exposition are extremely implausible (e.g. how Sonnier esacaped the slums to become Opera singing trophy wife of coporate high-flier; how sleazy gumshoe Jack came to know her and win her confidence, why Jack really gives a damn about any of this in the first place). The onward transport of the plot is regularly waylaid while Arvin is obliged to keep all the different plates he has set off spinning on their sticks.<br />All of the above boils down, I think, to the lack of a proper editor. Someone needed to be firm and say, &quot;Reed, just calm down. You have some great ideas. Save some of them for next time.&quot;<br />Lastly, underneath this superstructure there's no real metaphorical scheme - although as mentioned above as presented, there's no room for it anyway. What you see is what you get - it's basically an everything-and-kitchen-sink-thrown-in yarn. To my mind Arvin would have been better jettisoning half his hobby horses and writing a tight thriller with some sort of sophisticated figuarative underlay.<br />It's not a bad read by any means - Arvin sets up his protagonist as an engaging and loveable rogue, but this is not destined for any best seller lists anytime soon (despite Harper Collins' best efforts to ensure the contrary!)<br />Olly Buxtonparts of the exposition are extremely implausible (e.g. how Sonnier esacaped the slums to become Opera singing trophy wife of coporate high-flier; how sleazy gumshoe Jack came to know her and win her confidence, why Jack really gives a damn about any of this in the first place).

What is most striking about it is James Ellroy's buckshot prose, which he has taken to a new level, even for him. It scans almost like beat poetry.<br />Virtually every page (of 700 odd) is studded with short (and I mean *really* short, even by Ellroy's standards), staccato sentences repeating phrases in groups of three: \\"Frank was a doctor. Frank had bad habits. Frank made bad friends.\\"; \\"Wayne yawned. Wayne pulled carbons. The fine print blurred.\\"<br />I can see that this could, quite reasonably, prove extremely irritating, but I found that it gave the novel a real rhythm, like a Bo Diddley jungle beat. That sounds pretentious,  I know, but if you read it (and buy into it) you'll see what I mean. And it is used to extremely good, often comic effect.<br />As is the case with all Ellroy's novels, life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and (for the most part) short, although it must be said the principal protagonists do, by comparison, seem blessed with unfeasible longevity, and the plot is so Byzantine as to make Constantinople look like a one horse town: Cuba, Vietnam, Howard Hughes, the Vegas mafia, JFK's assassination, RFK's assassination, the Klan, Martin Luther King's assassination - it's all here, and in Ellroy's universe it's all inextricably linked.<br />I doubt it has any value as history (whether or not it is, Ellroy is clearly steeped in the history of the era), but it's such an exhilarating read, it really doesn't matter.<br />Olly Buxton	2004-04-02

The Sheltering Sky takes itself very seriously indeed.<br />Alas, Paul Bowles' enterprise is completely undermined by the (actually fairly well observed) characters: the lead roles in this Saharan melodrama are played by a husband and wife who have fallen out of love with each other. If this were all, I think Bowles might have got away with it. But crucially, the couple - Port and Kit - are also two of the most dislikeable lead characters to be found anywhere in contemporary fiction.<br />Port is selfish, unfaithful, rude and arrogant. Kit is hardly better: duplicitous, similarly unfaithful, hysterical, and given to an annoying irrationality which, towards the end of the book veers inexplicably towards sheer lunacy. Another reviewer has described them as \\"innocents abroad\\". That may be how they're regarded in the author's homeland; people in other parts of the world would recognise them as something rather different and, I'm bound to say, less appealing: \\"Americans abroad\\".<br />Port and Kit have the most irritating, implausible conversations; the sort which could only be invented by an author trying to explore Important Things. Consider the following exchange:<br />\\"`Why don't you extend your good wishes to all humanity, while you're at it?' she demanded.<br />\\"`Humanity?' cried Port. `What's that? Who is humanity? I'll tell you. Humanity is everyone but one's self. So of what interest can it be to anybody?'\\"<br />Anyone conducting this conversation in real life is, I respectfully submit, asking to have their lights punched out.<br /><br />It is thus extremely hard to give a damn about either of the characters. And when an author has lost (or in this case, never really gained) his audience's sympathy for his protagonists, then any message that might be embedded in their experiences is likely to remain buried (because the reader can't be bothered to look for it) or worse, to be rejected altogether. Instead, one can take perverse pleasure from their misfortunes (which are many and varied) - but this can hardly have been what Paul Bowles intended.<br />It is hard to understand what Bowles did intend, though: his writing at critical points is oblique enough to be completely meaningless. Again, take an example - a complete paragraph which arrives pretty much out of nowhere:<br />\\"His cry went on through the final image: the spots of raw bright blood on the earth. Blood on excrement. The supreme moment, high above the desert, when two elements, blood and excrement, long kept apart, merge. A black star appears, a point of darkness in the night sky's clarity. Point of darkness and gateway to repose. Reach out, pierce the fine fabric of the sheltering sky, take repose.\\"<br />If you know what on Earth that's all about, you've done better than me. And if you care, then this may be the book for you. If not, consider exchanging days of irritation for two short hours of it: rent Bartolucci's film version instead.<br />Olly Buxtonan author has lost (or in this case, never really gained) his audience's sympathy for his protagonists, then any message that might be embedded in their experiences is likely to remain buried (because the reader can't be bothered to look for it) or worse, to be rejected altogether.

US	52000095	RWS3A1V1RDAVK	0375508805	214765773	The Number: How the Drive for Quarterly Earnings Corrupted Wall Street and Corporate America	Books	4	28	30	N	N	I've got your number, sunshine	In the last few months I have read four accounts of the tech bubble. Glutton for punishment, aren't I. I've just got through Alex Berenson's \\"The Number\\". I was sent a free copy by the publisher. Alex Berenson himself emailed me to arrange this. So first up, in the spirit of full and fair disclosure, I disclose that I was given this book to review. I feel the need to say that especially in this case because I thought this was rather a good book. By some margin the best of the bunch, actually.<br />Where Roger Lowenstein's \\"Origins of the Crash\\" had the air of being something of an aggregation of newspaper clippings, and Frank Partnoy's \\"Infectious Greed\\" was less focussed, less penetrating, and in no real sense dispassionate, Mr. Berenson clearly sets out his stall with an interesting (and relevant) history of the regulation of corporate governance and reporting since the 1920s, and an analysis of the issues associated with accounting of any sort. In two short but clear appendices, Berenson explains in lay terms the difference between (and pros and cons of) accrual and sale accounting, and then balance sheets as opposed to income statements. These are fundamentals that one needs to understand what was going on, and not all of the authors who have written on the subject necessarily have a grasp of them.<br />Where as other authors have targeted (with varying degrees of persuasiveness) bodies such as ISDA, the SEC and the credit rating agencies as the main culprit, Berenson's focus stays very much with the auditing accountants and the corporate executives. A number of sectors in the financial system (in fact pretty much all of them) took their eye off the ball at the critical stages of the bubble, but were it not for the vagaries and flexibilities of accounting policy and sheer out-and-out greed of executives, this might not have happened, at least perhaps not quite so dreadfully. Berenson is convincing on both these scores.<br />That said, I don't subscribe to all Berenson's views. While the actions of some auditors (notably Andersen) are indefensible, Berenson supplies a pretty solid excuse for the profession generally: the preparation of company accounts, he notes, necessarily involves hundreds of assumptions, approximations and best guesses, and as even with the best will in the world these can be wrong, and \\"those who want to cheat have an almost infinite number of ways to do so\\". Given that the auditing function can only cost so much before it drives a company out of business by itself, there must be limits to what any auditor can be expected to detect. But Berenson still holds the profession to book. This isn't always consistent with Berenson's other view, which he expresses convincingly, that the \\"number\\" is intrinsically unreliable and should be much less of a determinant for market sentiment than it currently is. On the other hand, as he notes in his conclusion, even this view has its limits:  the stagnation of the Japanese markets in the last five or so years is testament to the perils of ignoring the \\"number\\" altogether.<br />Like most financial authors (with the exception of Michael Lewis, for whom he has considerably less respect than I have) Berenson favours more government regulation as part of the solution to the problem: Congress could limit the number of options companies could grant their CEOs or put restrictions on executive pay, he suggests. Perhaps accountants could be required to bid for audit work to a federal board.<br />With respect, this is silly: Irrespective of how ridiculous executive compensation may be (and Berenson is certainly convincing that it is), such a Soviet technique is absolutely the last thing that is required. The market has to learn these lessons and discount the stock of profligate companies itself: the government has no means (let alone resources: Berenson is similarly persuasive as to the lack of funding for the SEC) for ascertaining what is reasonable, whereas the market - albeiteventually - will find the charlatans out. I dare say Michael Eisner is finding this out to his discomfort at the moment. At some point short sellers will be able to exploit the arbitrage opportunity. Investors may lose in the short term, but if you aren't able to take a short term loss, you shouldn't be in the market. Like Partnoy does, Berenson concludes his book with recognition of this. Caveat Emptor, indeed. In some ways having the SEC as a comfort blanket for investors in itself fuelled the boom.<br />Elsewhere Berenson is occasionally guilty of sophistry. He points out the irony of price regulation of the commissions charged for trading on the NYSE, perhaps the most potent symbol of the free market on the planet. But then mixes his examples: \\"Wall Street has always loved free markets, except when they might cut into its fees. Today, when even real estate agents are being forced to compete on price, the 7 percent commissions charged by big investment banks for initial public offerings are sacrosanct.\\" This is naughty, and I suspect Berenson knows it. Commissions for underwriting IPOs are quite a different thing to commissions for brokering stock sales across the exchange. They have never been subject to any regulation, and if the fees tend to stick at a certain level, that not so much to do with price fixing, as the inherent risks and huge amount of work and expense required to get an IPO away. That is the market level. Given the dearth of IPOs in the last three years, the pitching for them will have been feverish.<br />I am prattling on.

So I have a theoretical conflict of interest, though I am doing my best not to allow it to affect - positively or negatively - my view of this book.<br />That being said it is a somewhat ironic marketing tactic  for Penguin to use n this particular case (but one which I heartily encourage, by the way) since Lowenstein's main theme is the mischief arising from conflicts of interest suffered by research analysts when covering the stocks of companies to whom their firms are pitching for investment banking business.<br />Be that as it may, I've disclosed it now, so you're warned.<br />Origins of the Crash covers much the same ground as Frank Partnoy's Infectious Greed and John Cassidy's Dot Con. As usual, Partnoy can't resist hopping on his moral high-horse, or mentioning 10+ year old derivatives scandals that have nothing to do at all with the recent market turmoil; Cassidy is more measured but restricts himself very much to the Dot Com phenomenon, adding an interesting history of the internet and computers in finance.<br />Lowenstein manages deals with the spinning, laddering and corporate governance scandals of the early part of this decade, but as many of the reviewers here have noted, doesn't really add much that you wouldn't know had you been reading the papers for the last few years.<br />Also, as he was with his book on LTCM, he is good at wisdom after the fact and retains a weakness for the cute aphorism, though he is more circumspect with it here and doesn't allow the neat turn of phrase to undermine his argument in quite the same way. Certainly, Lowenstein writes well; the book moves at a nice clip, and you never really get the chance to be bogged down.<br />For all that, I thought Origins of the Crash was a far more measured work than Partnoy's Infectious Greed (though not quite so comprehensive), and a better overview of the whole situation than Cassidy's Dot Con, but ultimately short on new insight or analysis.<br />If you're looking for an entertaining overview, though, this might just be the book for you.hensive), and a better overview of the whole situation than Cassidy's Dot Con, but ultimately short on new insight or analysis. <br />If you're looking for an entertaining overview, though, this might just be the book for you.	2004-02-18

In actual fact he worked on Wall Street for just two years in total, straight out of college. Instead of succeeding by staying the course, Partnoy made his millions by violating the Wall Street code of omerta and knocking out a sensationalist, mostly ignorant, account of the year or so he spent at Morgan Stanley. Infectious Greed is the follow-up, which purports to document the wreckage across the market since.<br /><br /> Having read FIASCO, which was valuable mostly for its unintended humour, I didn't expect much of Infectious Greed; I was rather looking forward to slating it, to be honest. It has the same air of maiden-aunt prurience as FIASCO but, almost despite himself, Partnoy's conclusions here aren't especially objectionable, and mostly undermine the tone of studied outrage he cultivates throughout the early part of the book.<br /><br /> The thesis of the book is that the financial markets have, of late, been corrupted by deceit and risk (hang on a minute: financial markets are *about* risk. Is it meaningful to say they can they be corrupted by it?). Yet at least half the book recounts events which took place ten or more years ago, in the primordial soup of the derivatives market. If a week is a long time in politics, a decade is an aeon on Wall Street: in 2004, the exploits of Bankers Trust and CS First Boston in 1993 aren't exactly current. The nascent derivatives market is now a mature trillion dollar industry. I dare say Professor Partnoy wouldn't recognise it.<br /><br /> Partnoy's explanations of the transactions are, however, lucid: so much so that they undo his conclusions. At one point he describes in two paragraphs the 'whipsaw' risk of an 'Inverse IO' instrument. It's a very clear explanation, which completely undermines his concluding observation that 'it was unclear whether any mutual-fund mangers [the investors] understood all of this'. Here's the thing: to put not too fine a point on it, a professional fund manager who doesn't understand what can be lucidly explained in eight sentences, yet still invests in it, should be shot. So should his employer. And neither deserves the respect (for which, read, money) of the public. It might seem a harsh lesson, but it wouldn't take too many collapses to shake the mums and dads in Ohio out of their complacent stupor and shift their funds to a manager who was prepared to employ qualified managers and supervise them properly. The market has a way of teaching people valuable lessons that market regulation and government bail-outs really don't.<br /><br /> The funny thing is, Partnoy does continually stumble over this axiom, but doesn't recognise it. He quotes a Peat Marwick partner who derides ignorant fund managers thus: 'if you don't understand, you might as well place it all on red at Atlantic City or Las Vegas, because at least there you get free drinks.' Though Partnoy doesn't think so, the analogy is a good one: the very monied nature of Wall Street is the most graphic illustration of the fact that, unless you really know your onions, you are NOT going to end up a winner. The house is; which is why most of them can afford to pay their 20,000+ employees salaries which average out at half a million dollars each (it's all in the annual report - do the sums!). Like Casinos, Wall Street trading desks have a motive ulterior to realising some poor schmuck's American dream: the object is to make, not lose, money, and this is exactly what they do and a statistically constant basis.<br /><br /> Partnoy repeatedly calls for regulation of the derivatives market without ever making a case for how this might be done or how it would prevent the losses he documents in the book: criminal statutes don't stop people committing murder, after all. All the regulation in the world won't stop fraudsters (if they'recommitting fraud, then by definition the regulations are already there, and they're breaking them). On the other hand, exploring the idiosyncrasies of rules *without* breaking them is the prerogative of every citizen, not just Wall Street banks. After all, regulatory arbitrage is only possible because of prescribed regulatory rules tend not to precisely reflect economic reality. If rules have irrational boundaries, then it is economically rational to exploit them.<br /><br /> Eventually, Partnoy acknowledges this. He cannot ultimately muster much venom for the perpetrators of the Enron debacle, and by the epilogue, where he sets out his recommendations (full marks to him for putting his money where is mouth is, by the way: it's one thing to criticise; quite another to suggest a solution) his proposals don't include regulation of the wholesale derivatives market (&quot;some derivatives markets might appropriately have been left unregulated&quot; he concedes) but simply equivalent accounting treatment with comparable financial instruments, and most of his fire is reserved not for Wall Street traders or greedy executives, but the credit rating agencies which operate under the umbrella of a government-sponsored oligopoly (only Moody's, Fitch and S&P are recognised for regulatory purposes). And you'll never guess what his solution is for dealing with the rating agencies: Without a hint of irony, he suggests they be deregulated!<br /><br /> By the final sentence of the book, it seems the most elementary elements of market theory may have finally slipped through: Partnoy asks his readers whether they have taken any prudent steps to properly evaluate their investments before putting up any money: 'If you answered 'no,' you have one more person to blame in addition to the accountants, bankers, lawyers, credit raters, corporate executives, directors and regulators who failed to spot the various financial schemes of recent years.

You do have to feel a little sorry for Douglas Adams since, being dead, he didn't have much say in its publication, and at least half of the material comprises an unedited (one hopes) early draft for a new Dirk Gently novel, but ultimately he's to blame him for it; he, and no-one else, wrote every word, and with the notable exception of a couple of articles, pretty much every word is dire.<br />Douglas Adams wasn't a born novelist, after all - he was a radio producer, scriptwriter and general gadfly about town whose enormous, but accidental, success with the radio show The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy obliged him to become a novelist.<br />As a novelist, he certainly had some nice ideas, a keen eye for social observation, and an idiosyncratic - definitely witty - turn of phrase which sustained itself for the 120 odd pages of the penguin paperback, but had thoroughly worn out its welcome by the end of the second instalment. And there it really all should have ended.<br />Instead Adams was compelled (no doubt for financial reasons) to promulgate further, increasingly smug and vapid, instalments of the Hitch-Hiker's series, two fully fledged Dirk Gently novels (again, the idea was good, execution irritating as hell), and with each the sense grew that Adams spent far too much time engineering clever-clogs grammatical constructions, and not nearly enough time concentrating on the novel he was trying to write. Instead of murdering his own darlings, Adams smothers the readers with them instead.<br />Thereafter, career as a novelist seemed to die off, to be succeeded by a unremarkable career of op-ed pieces for broadsheets and computer magazines, together with creation of various pieces of software and computer games. These were the lofty heights attained by such an apparently gifted writer.<br />This posthumously published book anthologises the post Dirk Gently aspect of his career. I can save those of you who have not caught up with Douglas Adams since Zaphod Beeblebrox a few wasted hours here: You've not missed much.<br />Just two pieces are worth the paper they're written on; one is a plea for a new global standard universal AC adapter for all electrical appliances, the other is a lengthy ex tempore speech in which Adams, without recourse to his irritating brand of wit, sets out his extremely convincing, well-composed views on religion and atheism. Given my views on his textual over-engineering, I think it is no accident that this piece, which stands head and shoulders above anything else in this book, was spoken on the hoof, apparently without notes.up with Douglas Adams since Zaphod Beeblebrox a few wasted hours here: You've not missed much.<br />Just two pieces are worth the paper they're written on; one is a plea for a new global standard universal AC adapter for all electrical appliances, the other is a lengthy ex tempore speech in which Adams, without recourse to his irritating brand of wit, sets out his extremely convincing, well-composed views on religion and atheism.

US	52000095	RT31YJFXK6XEP	0679740678	67210777	The Man in the High Castle	Books	4	9	12	N	N	Classic Dick	With works like this and \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" it is odd that Phillip K Dick is not more widely read than he is, as his books rate for the most part with the doyens of American 20th century literature. This is the curse, I guess, of being branded a Sci-Fi Writer. It's embarassing to admit you like Sci-Fi.<br />The Man in the High Castle is superbly realised and depicted, and as with most of Dick's fiction, the outward subject of the book (in this case an alternative history of the 20th Century in which the Axis won the war and Japan and Germany conquered America) is only really the setting for a fascinating examination of the human protagonists, and the dilemmas of life they face inside it.<br />For this reason alone, his books have tended not to date; the particular issues they address are not of technology or history, but largely of personality and \\"spirituality\\" (for want of a better word).<br />The Man In The High Castle is also very well observed - in partiucular the ever-so slightly contorted constructions of Japanese English emanating from those in the Pacific States (whether Japanese or not) are very cleverly done. It is noteworthy that Dick doesn't stoop to make soft scores: there is little overt reference to the atrocities of the Second World War, and neither the German not the Japanese occupations are depicted as wholly brutal or totalitarian regimes - this is implied to an extent for the German regime, but none of the action really takes place there, and the Japanese government is portrayed surprisingly sympathetically, particularly at an individual level.<br />Ultimately, The Man In The High Castle descends out of focus and into incoherency, but as mentioned above, plot wasn't really what interested Dick, and this tends to be a characteristic of his novels.<br />Recommended.	2003-11-30

His London Biography, in particular, is an outstanding book.<br />I had, therefore, high hopes for his life of Blake, the 18th century visionary being a famous Londoner and a fascinating man.<br />I was a little disappointed. It's certainly learned and well researched (though it eggregiously overuses the word &quot;vouchsafe&quot;), but seems to skip over a number of important points: for one thing, Ackroyd hints darkly the Blake may have had misogynistic tendencies, but then declares &quot;this isn't the place for a discussion of such things&quot;. Well, if a balanced biography isn't, I don't know what is.<br />Additionally, Ackroyd is somewhat credulous in his desire to portray Blake as a misunderstood genius, rather than a somewhat troubled individual. Serious credence is given to statements that certain people in Blake's circle (including, to an extent, Blake himself) were clairvoyant, whilst on the other hand short shrift is given to far more credible notions: such as that Blake - a man given to regular visions of angels and saints, after all - might have been mentally ill. Blake's behaviour may have been that of a genius, but is equally explainable as that of a flat-out nutcase, which appears to have been the general consensus of the time (and might partly explain Blake's lack of success during his own life).	2003-11-01

The complaint here seems to be the conscious direction of this \\"subversive\\" material at impressionable teenaged minds.<br />Well, a liberal education will tell you that Christian teaching might be seen in certain quarters as similarly subversive (for example, to people who aren't Christian), but you don't hear too many people calling for PG ratings to be slapped on the Good Book.<br />The point is that this is clearly a work of fantasy fiction: sure, it borrows from Christian fable, but by the same token it heavily modifies it. Several of the events upon which Pullman invites the reader's ethical judgment do not (to my knowledge) appear anywhere in actual Christian legend. Pullman made them up, so as slings and arrows against the real religion (which I don't believe Pullman intends them to be), they have no force at all.<br />To the extent this trilogy counsels young adults to question the world view they get from organised religion - this is, I suspect, what really sticks in the craw - it seems to me to be a wholly worthwhile enterprise. I gather Pullman is not religious, but His Dark Materials is obviously informed by Blake and Milton, and fondly so, and I didn't find this an especially anti-Christian read (then again, I read as someone who is culturally but not intellectually Christian, so am probably less inclined than some to take offence)<br />As for the content of the story, I think comparisons with Harry Potter are unfair; it's much better than that: His Dark Materials deserves to be held up against CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien; the best JK Rowling can say is that, with The Goblet of Fire and The Order Of The Phoenix, she's catching up - but as yet she has a lot of development as a writer to do.<br />What's so nice about His Dark Materials is how imaginative it all is. Whereas Harry Potter, from Hogwarts down, is wholly derivative, Pullman treats us to new ideas: the daemon is a classic example.

Well, I'm not so sure a \\"compare\\" isn't a more useful exercise than a \\"contrast\\".<br />Scipio is executed differently, no doubt about it: Where Fingerpost was told, in four instalments, from the perspective of the protagonists, Scipio is narrated in a rather dislocated third person past tense. Pears can't hide his own prose behind the personality of his characters this time, and while it is crisply written, the dialogue is - and its subjects are - remarkably sterile. For example, Pears would have us believe that, having been informed his lover has been carted off to a Nazi concentration camp, a character would complain about it by drawing analogies to Ancient Rome. Now this might fit the intellectual scheme of the novel, but it reads like a dog.<br />In Scipio, instead of four very different accounts of the same sequence of events, we have one account of three very different sequences of events - or do we? The parallels between the three sagas in Scipio are extraordinary, as if exactly the same scenario were playing out each time, History were repeating itself, only through the eyes of a different observer. This is really no more than a slight variation on the programme Pears adopted for Fingerpost.<br />For all that, and despite being a good deal shorter, Scipio is by far the harder book to get through. Especially compared to their living, breathing, stinking counterparts in the Fingerpost, the characters of Scipio are off-puttingly one-dimensional. Barneuve in particular has no flesh to him at all.<br />You get the sense here, far more than in Fingerpost, that this is the work of a doddery old academic written to please no-one but himself. I guess that's the licence granted by the extraordinary success of An Instance of the Fingerpost. The Dream of Scipio is erudite for the sake of being erudite, and at the expense of being entertaining.<br />The Dream of Scipio is certainly a very clever, learned book and, at the death, extremely absorbing, but it burns too coldly in getting there to match the success of An Instance of the Fingerpost.udite, and at the expense of being entertaining. <br />The Dream of Scipio is certainly a very clever, learned book and, at the death, extremely absorbing, but it burns too coldly in getting there to match the success of An Instance of the Fingerpost.	2003-07-16

Our toddler WILL NOT GO TO BED until we've done Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy, or more recently, some of Hairy's other exploits (especially Hairy Maclary's BONE and the CATERWAUL CAPER).<br />Unfortunately for yours truly, these are pretty dull books to read night after night, so you have to be very imaginative about how you read them: I find allocating each of the dogs a different accent (sometimes rotating accents each night) or spoonerising the text as you go along keeps the old fellow happy as the young one is still entranced.<br />On the other hand, the rhymes kick along quite nicely, and the illustrations - which are an unintentionally dead-on representation of the mind numbingly mundane world of semi-rural New Zealand - are great.<br />The final line - I don't think it's spoiling anything to reveal that it's \\"straight back home to bed!\\" - is an unfailing cue for young sir to lie down, close his eyes, and refrain from screaming the neighbourhood down should father deign to switch off the light. As there is nothing else on this dear earth I have found which will do that, Lynley Dodd has truly earned my heartfelt gratitude and respect.<br />My one literary nitpick is that Dodd has wholesale nicked the character Scarface Claw off the great New Zealand cartoonist Murray Ball, whose long-running newspaper strip \\"Footrot Flats\\" featured a timid sheepdog and its travails with a truly ferocious, semi-feral tomcat by the name of Horse.<br />And as for being the \\"toughest tom in town\\" - pshaw - Horse would have Scarface, any day of the week.	2003-06-14

They make an interesting comparison.<br />Dunbar - a physicist by trade - is more interested in the theoretical economics that went into the risk arbitrage fund in the first place and how this came unstuck. He gives a long description of the Black-Scholes model, what it says, and how it was used to pull off the risk &quot;free&quot; trades which made Long Term so much money for three or four years.<br />Lowenstein, by contrast, barely mentions either the Black-Scholes model (he barely touches on option pricing at all, as a matter of fact) or the Italian convergence trades which eventually blew the gaffe on the fund, but instead tells the human story, exposes the inevitable egos, and indulges in more than a little smuggery (this book is long on wisdom after the fact) in dissecting the naivety of the LTCM hedging and trading strategy and the people who ran it.<br />As long as he sticks to the egos and the posturing, When Genius Failed is a dandy read: the negotiations amongst the Wall Street top brass as the fund is going under rate with anything served up in Barbarians at the Gate, and as this is a large part of the book, it rips along quite nicely.<br />But the schadenfreude grates: One of the lessons of the whole fiasco was that the smart money is with the guy who can predict the future: any old mug can be a genius with hindsight. Lowenstein spends a lot of his time wisely pointing out what the traders should have done.<br />Additionally, Lowenstein employs some metaphors which indicate he might not have much of a grip on his subject: for one, he states &quot;a bit of liquidity greases the wheels of markets; what Greenspan overlooked is that with too much liquidity, the market is apt to skid off the tracks.&quot; It's a poor metaphor, because it isn't excess liquidity which causes markets to skid, rather, it's the sudden disappearance of it. As this is the fundamental lesson of the Long Term story, it's a bad mistake to make for the sake of a smart-alec aphorism.<br />Similarly, in the epilogue states, with regard to the putative diversification in the fund &quot;the Long-Term episode proved that eggs in separate baskets *can* break simultaneously&quot;. Again, this conclusion is not supported by the text, which observes several times that in a market crash, liquidity drains and the correlation risk of instruments in the market goes to one: that is to say, it turns out all your eggs are in the same basket after all. Diversity wasn't the problem; the problem was you wrongly thought you had it.<br />For these reasons I prefer Dunbar's more academic work: it may not be such a sizzling read, but nor does it misguidedly kick a fund when it's down.ppearance of it.

As Cassidy mentions from the outset, the prospectuses all contained large print health warnings in prominent places: \\"THIS COMPANY HAS NEVER MADE ANY MONEY, MOST LIKELY NEVER WILL\\" - but the punters still bought and bought. There were many psychological and sociological factors at play, but deception was not one of them.<br />For all that, Dot Con is well researched, well written and entertaining into the bargain (my copy was the paperback second edition in which the typos & manifest errors spotted by keen Amazonians (none of which, in my view, was earth-shattering) had been corrected). Cassidy describes briefly and competently the history of the internet and the general financial environment of the last 50 years, and then takes you into the maelstrom of the bubble from 1995 to 2001, all of which he portrays in suitably stunned-mullet fashion. The new edition features a lengthy epilogue which surveys the wreckage and covers the subsequent inquiry into the practices of investment banking firms and their uneasy relationships with their research analysts, all of which is still very current.<br />While he doesn't really dwell on it, I think Cassidy would come out in favour of more market regulation and intervention: He's especially critical of the Fed's approach to monetary policy and the atmosphere on the street which led to the boom in the first place.<br />In some ways (though it's hardly fashionable to say so) the investment banking firms and fund managers were as much victims of this as anyone: while the roof is blowing off the market and the choice is to join in and make hay, or watch your competitors annexing large portions of your market share while you sit on your hands, it is a singular Wall Street firm indeed which chooses to sit the boom out.<br />In any event this is a thoughtful and well put together book and serves as a pretty good overview of some of the most remarkable times in the history of modern finance.to sit the boom out.<br />In any event this is a thoughtful and well put together book and serves as a pretty good overview of some of the most remarkable times in the history of modern finance.	2003-04-29

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	3	9	12	N	N	A stunning feat of endurance ... and that's just reading it	Harassed by the faithful for my ambivalent views of the movie instalments, the main allegation levelled at me was \\"you can't understand it unless you've read the books\\". Notwithstanding that this by itself is a pretty damning criticism of a film, I thought, all right, I'll do it. Two months later, I'm finally done.<br />The good parts: The Lord of the Rings is a collossal feat of imagination, no doubt about it. Tolkien indeed has<br />constructed an entire world, a history and a mythology, invented a language (though what the point of that was, for the purposes of writing a novel, I'm not really sure) and devised some pretty authentic sounding epic poetry, although the main pleasure I took from these frequent songs, poems and ditties was skipping them completely and thereby moving a step closer to my quest (viz., getting to the end of this monstrous ordeal).<br />And - though I'm not sure this is necessarily a good thing - Tolkien definitely founded a new literary genre: the sword and sorcery corner of your bookshop owes its existence to this mammoth tome.<br />But for all that, getting through Lord of the Rings was VERY HARD WORK.<br />Mostly responsible is Tolkien's dreadful, dreadful prose. Tolkien's voice is throughout peppered with hithers, thithers and whithers, yonder this and lo! that. The dialogue is similarly cod heroic in a way which you either go for, or you find laughable, for a while, and then sapping of your very will to go on. This also creates an impression of general humourlessness - for a story about elves, gnomes, trolls and wizards, it's all taken rather too seriously.<br />And it is not sub-edited nearly vigourously enough, to the point where the sense of the story (as opposed to the \\"quest\\") pretty much dies on the vine. Tolkien will take pages to describe fairly simple mechanical details: four pages, in one case, to describe how Sam and Frodo descended from a rock ledge to the ground. The story is forced this way to become episodic, and a thousand page yarn can't afford to be just a string of otherwise unconnected events.<br />And having slogged through nearly a thousand pages for it, I was dismayed to hit the main climax of the quest with a good 60 pages still to go. Bizarrely a completely unrelated sub-story was then tacked on to the end. A decent sub-editor would have simply dropped the \\"Scouring of the Shire\\" into the waste paper basket.<br />So much for execution. Given the elaborate historical and social context that Tolkien has devised, what is most surprising about the content is how extraorinarily simple - naive, really - Tolkien's moral universe is. There are two forces: good and evil, and you're either one or the other.<br />This seemed to me to rob the story of any intellectual sophistication beyond that of an elaborate fairytale.<br />Not only is the moral scheme naive but it isn't properly prepared. Nothing is ever done (and it's not like a lack of space prevented it!) to explain who or what Sauron is, and why he is evil. Similarly, except for the merest hint at the gates of Gondor, barely a thought is expounded on whether Gandalf (undoubtedly a powerful and persuasive figure, and one with a great deal to gain from the downfall  of Saruman and Sauron) might have alterior motives. Those characters who do make this suggestion turn out to be enchanted by the Evil One themselves.<br />For all that, though, the complexity and sophistication of the physical universe that Tolkien has created is the impression that lasts, and I suspect that Tolkien's story will continue to sell long after the special edition DVDs have been remaindered.usand page yarn can't afford to be just a string of otherwise unconnected events.<br />And having slogged through nearly a thousand pages for it, I was dismayed to hit the main climax of the quest with a good 60 pages still to go.

OK, the five-line musical notation might not, but if you're reading that, you're not a real bluesman in the first place - everyone knows bluesmen don't read music.<br />But seriously, on that point, Robert Johnson isn't meant to be played note perfectly - if you listen to his own recordings, you'll see he didn't play it the same way twice himself. So what this book gives, a pretty accurate verse and chorus from each of his songs, should be more than enough to get you on your way.<br />And if it isn't - if you don't immediately feel imbued with the spirit of the great blues masters, then here's what you do - to hell (ahem) with a note perfect trascription: just head down them cross roads at midnight...	2003-02-01

Broken down to its fundamental bits, the Telecaster is 95% the same as its fancy sister, the Stratocaster (in the most brutal analysis, functionally a Stratocaster is just a Telecaster with some extra woodwork and a couple more gizmos on the front), but, while the style and approach to playing a Stratocaster is interchangeable enough with that of most other electric guitars, you can't just pick up a Telecaster and play it the same way. To get the best out of a Telecaster you almost have to re-learn the guitar. This is not just a case of tone or sound - it's actual execution.<br />If you want to do that, then this is the book for you. Arlen Roth is one of the best known Tele session men in the business, and while he's no Byron or Keats, the explanations are simple enough to follow, and the exercises (there are hundreds of them so do not fret (har har) that you'll run out any time soon) are great mix - some challenging, some easy, but most importantly all authentic sounding. You don't need to get far into this book to be learning useful stuff which will expand your tonal palette for good.<br />For some reason, Telecaster playing has developed in a different direction to \\"normal\\" guitar playing, and dipping into this book gives you another direction to explore. It does require your own application of course - more application than I can easily be bothered mustering, so I think this book will be dipped into every now and then rather than worn out cover to cover. That's a criticism of me, not the book, of course.<br />Nitpicks: the CD track numbering doesn't match the exercise numbers. This seems to me to be an elementary mistake, and it means that tracking down the CD part for, say, Exercise 104 (Elvis's Mystery Train - practically the first thing I did when I opened the package from Amazon) - is hard. Also the book won't (without massacring the spine) stay open when you try to play along with an exercise.<br />The book also includes a brief history of the Telecaster and a few photos, but neither the photos (included mostly to show off Roth's collection, I suspect) nor the history are really much chop and I certainly wouldn't recommend the book for these alone. It's a fairly cheaply produced and printed edition, but the value of the advice in it alone justifies the price.(without massacring the spine) stay open when you try to play along with an exercise.<br />The book also includes a brief history of the Telecaster and a few photos, but neither the photos (included mostly to show off Roth's collection, I suspect) nor the history are really much chop and I certainly wouldn't recommend the book for these alone.

I had a 1998 edition, which was probably one of the most thumbed books in my house, and finally rewarded myself to upgrading to the latest, 2003 version. What inevitably happens is this: I go to look up one film, and on the way, flicking through the pages, see another. That makes me think of a third which I then start to look for, but then I see a fourth... and before you know it, and hour has passed and I've completely forgotten which movie it was I was looking up in the first place. A very organic way of reading, and thoroughly, personally recommended as a way of passing the time waiting for your two-year old son to fall asleep!<br />This is a terrific resource: Maltin and his team of editors have a huge knowledge of the history of cinema, and the small amount of text which is afforded to each entry (by necessity - there are something like 14,000 movies reviewed - is unfailingly to the point - curt, in many cases - and gives a very good flavour of the reviewer's view of the movie.<br />The reviews, and star ratings, are very tough indeed, and in no sense does Maltin concede to public (or fashionable) opinion: if he doesn't like a film, no matter how well regarded it may be, he'll mark it down. Blade Runner, for example, gets just two stars our of four, while Memento, in my view a fantastic film and one which I've never heard a bad word said against, avoids the dreaded \\"BOMB\\" rating by just half a star. While often times you may not agree with this rating, you do have to respect Maltin's integrity.<br />There are one or two items I would mention (although, as Maltin would say, why carp?) which probably add up to imperfections, but which don't rob the book of my five stars:<br />In terms of its judgments, Maltin is guilty of the \\"They Don't Make Them Like They Used To\\" complex: there is a rather pompous introduction which says as much, and I have not been able to locate one film released since 1998 which has been awarded the full four stars. On the other hand, the top rating is liberally thrown about for films made in the forties or before: Adam's Rib: ever heard of that? Me neither. It may be true that there is a lot of commercial rubbish around now, but no more so than there ever was, and I think Maltin should be courageous enough to say at the time of release (rather than waiting for a film to pass the test of time) to pronounce a film a four star effort.<br />In much the same vein, Maltin seems to be no great fan of comedy. Having looked through all the greatest comedy films I could think of, only two have been awarded four stars, and both of those by the Marx Brothers: Duck Soup and A Night At The Opera (oh, and Adam's Rib is a comedy too, apparently). I think there is some cinema snobbery going on here. Films should be judged according to their genre, and the fact that none of Zucker & Abrahams, Monty Python, the Coen Brothers, or Rob Reiner has had any of their comedies credited as four star movies is a little telling.<br />A couple of nit-picks: I think a star system of up to five would give a little more room for flexibility in ratings, and I don't understand why TV Movies aren't subjected to the same regime (again, I think this is a little cinema snobbery: TV Movies, apparently, can only be \\"average\\", \\"above average\\" or \\"below average\\".)<br />Lastly, the indexing is pretty meagre: If you can't remember the titled of the movie, then unless it starred a major league actor, you are staring at one big haystack in which to find your needle. I guess space prevents anything more, but I would have thought an index of Directors wouldn't have hurt - or indeed a list of all four star (and BOMB) movies. In fact would be great to be able to get this book on CD-ROM so you could search on any name (or, indeed, sort by rating!)l four stars.

The way to approach it is to barrel through it at a hundred miles an hour - that's the pace it was intended to be read at - and eventually everything will start making sense by itself. Even if it doesn't there is still something exhilarating about the way James Ellroy writes: it's  a guilty pleasure, and Black Dahlia features some of his best writing. If after a while you really find yourself struggling, just google on \\"Ellroy Glossary\\" and you'll pick up any number of fanzine crib sheets.<br />Once you get the hang of the Ellroy idiom it's quite addictive and you even start talking like that yourself a bit. Which is embarrassing.<br />As with all Ellroy novels I've read, in Black Dahlia the streets are mean, the characters morally bankrupt, and the plot so byzantine as to implicate every one from the chief of police to some Mexican pornographers. This is very much Ellroy's world view: fundamentally we are all ugly, and the worst of us are the ones who pretend we're not. It's very Thomas Hobbes, actually.<br />The plot scenario is very similar to L.A. Confidential - two cops with a strange interpersonal relationship and a common squeeze on the hunt for the perpetrator of a dastardly crime. But while the crime is much more brutal, the book itself is not so dark. Sure it isn't Ogden Nash, but it (and especially the Ellroy Lingo) frequently had me sniggering as I read. Maybe I'm just desensitised to Ellroy's morbid style.<br />I think the danger with Ellroy is to read too much into it; the patios is so convincing it is easy to mistake this for something deeper than it is: like Quentin Tarantino, Ellroy is the first to admit his art really is pulp fiction, despite what the critical luvvies say.<br />But look, bottom line, it's a cracking read, and that's all you really need to know.	2002-12-19

Franzen's depiction of ailing, failing patriarch Al Lambert is geniunely funny (he comes off more than a little like George Costanza's father), thoroughly tragic and, because of both aspects, shudderingly recognisable. Franzen's characterisation works so well because he recongises that the same person - the same characteristics, even, can be funny and tragic at the same time, depending on your perspective. And Franzen deliberately swtiches perspective throughout the book, to make this very point.<br />The book is also gripping: I'm no great fan of \\"longer fiction\\" -having a typical male attention span, I tend to lose interest in a novel after about 400 pages unless it has pictures, but experienced no such difficulties here. Indeed, I usually read at night to help me get to sleep, but The Corrections was keeping me so awake that I had to ditch it for something a little more somniferous.<br />It's not comfortable reading;  because the characterisation is so plausible you find yourself applying the scenarios to your own life, which is (well, in my case) sobering.<br />Nitpicks - while the characterisation was spot on, some of the plot lines were a little contrived; I didn't buy Chip's Lithuanian foray, and I couldn't help thinking Franzen let his male fantasist off the leash a little in devising some of the other subplots.<br />But this is piffling stuff: overall, this is a five-starrer, no question about it.	2002-10-18
US	52000095	R8ED18ZH1TYND	0786868767	964050438	Koba the Dread	Books	2	8	26	N	N	Martin the Dreadful	Martin Amis' new book does three things:<br />Firstly, it concisely and interestingly catalogues the evils of Stalin's communist regime (and to an extent Lenin's and what might have been in Trotsky's). An excellent service for those of us, like me, who don't fancy slogging through Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, vols. I, II and III, Robert Conquest's several books on Russia, and the other numerous sources which Amis cites, frequently at some length. It is solely an overview, though: Amis contributes not a single new fact or assertion to the field of writing which is already out there. Occasionally he does stoop to administer a swift, unnecessary kick to Stalin's corpse in the form of some rather childish name-calling.<br />Secondly, on the strength of the first, it makes the very valid point (which, though, has been made elsewhere) that the western intelligentsia (and especially, quelle surprise, the western liberal intelligentsia) is utterly hypocritical in its analysis and commentary on the \\"good old\\" communist regime compared to, say, Hitler's Nazi regime. No-one sees the funny side of the Holocaust, but the soviets, perhaps because of their appealing ideology, have been rather let off for the terrors of Stalin's regime. This point is well worth repeating, and I guess it's enough of a hook to hang a book around, but (especially since it's not an original thought) 'tis but a single swallow and not a summer.<br />Thirdly, Koba the Dread contains some unordered, pompous, not obviously relevant and frankly bizarre pontifications, an extract of some personal correspondence presenting just Amis' side of an argument with a left-leaning colleague (it's noteworthy that Amis is not sporting enough to include - or even refer to - the colleague's rebuttal) and, most inexplicably of all, an open letter to his own, deceased, father (ending, ludicrously enough, \\"Your middle child hails you and embraces you\\").<br />All of this can only have been included on the presupposition that the author's personal life and views would be found interesting and worthwhile simply on account of who he is, whose son he was (Kingsley's, in case you didn't know) and who he is friends with (Kinglsey's mates, mostly). Then, without any hint of justification, Amis introduces his own sister's recent death into proceedings, despite acknowledging (to his dead father) \\"Sally has, of course, nothing whatever in common with [the victims of Stalin's regime].\\"<br />In short, in this last 32 page section of the book, Martin Amis totally blows his cover. What on earth was he thinking? More to the point, what was his editor thinking? Without this section, Koba runs to 242 pages: perhaps it was necessary to pad out to justify the price of a hard back book? Or is this author such a significant literary figure nowadays that he is beholden to no-one? Perhaps no-one dared stand up to him, for fear of the reprisals...?<br />In case you were wondering (well, I was), the book's silly title can be explained thus: \\"Koba\\" was Stalin's childhood nickname. \\"... the Dread\\" is a relatively unused variant on \\"... the Terrible\\", as in \\"Ivan the Terrible\\".  So, Koba the Dread; Josef the Terrible, see?<br />Martin, how come you didn't call your book \\"Josef the Terrible\\"?sition that the author's personal life and views would be found interesting and worthwhile simply on account of who he is, whose son he was (Kingsley's, in case you didn't know) and who he is friends with (Kinglsey's mates, mostly).

On University Challenge, by dint of having the answers written on a card in front of him, Paxman creates the illusion of his own omniscience while brutally deriding the hapless nerd who should, as a starter for ten, incorrectly conjugate an irregular latin verb.<br />In the same spirit, he's dashed off this rangey discourse on the English. It's about as convincing; just as no-one thinks he really knows the answers on University Challenge all by himself, at no time reading this book are you fooled into thinking Paxman is any more expert a commentator on this fascinating subject than your average upper middle class English windbag.<br />He covers his ground erratically - a discussion of English eating habits lurches suddenly into an exposition on football violence - and extremely subjectively - Paxman divines the attributes which he believes are generally attributed to the English character without reference to anything more solid than his own (decidely university-educated and middle-class) impression, and rounds out his overview with an unconvincing collection of anecdotes, which don't represent the overwhleming proof of the points that he thinks they do. Irritatingly, in his final summation, Paxman seems to invoke an image of the real England (as a sort of green and pleasant land) which he has spent most of his book undermining.<br />Nor is the copy especially well written - occasionally, Paxman's syntax is just awful, and towards the end the sub-editor obviously wasn't paying much attention to cliches and repeated uses of the same expressions, sometimes within half a page or so of each other. Most people won't notice this, but it irritates the pants off me.<br />For all this it's a pretty jolly, harmless rant, and quite easy to get through.<br />But for real insight into national character I think it's always best to leave the analysis to an outsider. Interestingly, Paxman is dismissive of Bill Bryson, just such an author, who has done a similar job on this English, only with a lot more style.<br />Methinks the lady doth protest too much?character I think it's always best to leave the analysis to an outsider.

It hasn't been an especially pleasant experience; A Song of Stone is a pretentious, mean-spirited, violent, and not especially well-written book, and this one is mean-spirited and violent, and not especially well written either. At least it isn't pretentious.<br />Here we have a reprobate, lefty Scottish hack who is unwittingly drawn into the police inquiry into a serial killer, when Inspector Knacker realises that the victims were all named in a single article written by the journalist a number of years previously. It's a frame up, Guv - or is it? Banks has a bob each way for about half the novel; cunningly (or tiresomely, depending on how you look at it) adopting the second person singular voice when recounting the grisly deeds of the murderer (and they are recounted in graphic detail: the squeamish should take the next exit and follow the signs back to Helen Fielding), but all the while else writing from Colley's first person perspective. So does Colley know the killer? Is it Colley himself? Is he an accomplice?  Maybe he's schizophrenic! Surely, Iain Banks wouldn't stoop to such a level...<br />And nor - I think - does he. The split narration a pretty neat device for creating suspense, but rather than stringing it out, Banks changes tack mid way through and reveals the killer's identity, at which point the second person singular narratives stop, and a pretty convoluted back-story emerges, involving, as is seemingly inevitable in Banks' fiction, unpleasant childhood flashbacks.<br />This in turn gives perspective to the political/moral issues which gallivant throughout the book, but which are finally bludgeoned to death in a very poor denouement, in which Banks contrives to put his two main protagonists in a bunker on an island arguing intently about the rights and wrongs of the situation. Banks' writing, usually deft at handling this sort of situation, steers like a cow on this occasion.<br />All is ultimately thrown into confusion again in the final couple of pages with the reintroduction of the second person narrative voice, previously only associated with the Killer. So was it Colley all along? Beats me. Hard on the heels of the obnoxious Pol Sci 101 lecture in from the bunker, I really didn't care.<br />For all this, Complicity has had some (questionable) literary influence though: Irvine Welsh's protagonist DS Bruce Robertson in his genuinely dire novel, Filth, is heavily indebted to Cameron Colley - it's difficult to see Welsh devising a boozing, drug-doing, sex mad hypocritical Scotsman harbouring an internal parasite without having seen this first. Which makes Welsh's achievement all the more paltry.<br />On the other hand, I think Banks owes a debt of gratitude to Thomas Harris - there is a distinctly Lecterish feel to the machinations of the Serial Killer.<br />In summary, this is not as great a book as some would have you believe: Banks' style is refreshingly different at first, but when - as I just have - you read a couple of them back to back, the tricks in his magician's bag begin to reveal themselves.n. <br />All is ultimately thrown into confusion again in the final couple of pages with the reintroduction of the second person narrative voice, previously only associated with the Killer.

US	52000095	R2HSM7F52OIFOK	0684855364	181423734	A SONG OF STONE: A Novel	Books	1	11	18	N	N	Banks' gas tank is running low - this is pretentious twaddle	Since publication of the undeniably startling The Wasp Factory in 1984, Iain Banks has been extremely prolific, alternating between Science Fiction and \\"straight\\" fiction. 1997, when A Song of Stone was published, was a \\"straight year\\".<br />What is most remarkable about Banks' record is, for all his volume, the quality and inventiveness of the titles has been almost uniformly excellent: Banks has almost single-handedly set the agenda in Science Fiction in the last twenty years, and his straight works (while never quite reaching the clammy gothic heights of The Wasp Factory) have been consistently inventive.<br />While I'm no sci-fi buff, I think Banks is better in Science Fiction mode, at least two of his culture novels (The Use Of Weapons and Excession) for my money being as good as any other fictional works produced anywhere in the last twenty years.<br />So there are my credentials: I'm one of the party faithful. But even so, I pronounce this effort a total stinker. I guess it was inevitable that the creative engine would begin to get low on gas after 13 straight years of constant acceleration, and I think the long decline began here (in 2001, for the first time, Banks didn't publish a new novel in the autumn).<br />The first thing which truly offends the senses is not the dark obsessional interest with death and degradation - one tends to look forward to that in an Iain Banks novel - but the dismally pompous writing style. It's completely affected - it isn't like he can't write crisply, because he's done that in every other book he's ever written, so clearly it's a deliberate strategy, but what Banks expects to achieve (other than perversely aggravating his customers) is beyond me. But just occasionally you wonder whether you're not the butt of some dreadfully ironic tease: consider this sentence as an object lesson in the pot calling the kettle black:<br />\\"I have seen the choice of morning clothes occupy you almost until lunch, been witness to the search for precisely the correct scent, watched it take an afternoon or more of delicate anointing, slow rubbing and judicious sniffing, observed a simple sonnet absorb you for an evening of frowns and troubled sighs, found you intent and serious, the very picture of unaffected sincerity as you hang on every word of some dreadful bore for what seems half the night...\\"<br />Hmmm, Mister Banks. Are you having a laugh?<br />Banks also relies on some tried and true literary devices, including his favourite, the childhood flashbacks, which (sensibly enough) are the only point where he allows himself out of his over-clever adoption of the present tense. Elsewhere, the symbolism is forced: For aristocracy, Abel has spent a lot of his life, apparently being thrown down muddy wells, drowning in filthy water, sliding down muddy banks and being urinated and vomited on from a great height, and at one stage extricates himself - by way of a muddy birth himself, from under an overturned jeep. The construct is - if you'll excuse the pun - somewhat laboured.<br />Ultimately, getting through this book is rather like wading through mud. The final chapter, a pompous, staring-death-in-the-face soliloquy from the narrator (hence, I suppose, the present tense) is where the mud becomes impassable cod philosophy, and it just goes ON and ON.<br />Once again, you get the feeling the Banks knows exactly what he's doing:  viz., having a laugh at the reader's expense: at one stage Abel conjectures, supposedly referring to his own death: \\"Do I want an end too tidy? Or too loose? I do not know, my dears, though an answer will dawn on me soon, no doubt. I think I want my death now. Do I?\\"<br />Well, it's almost pantomime, isn't it. I found myself shrieking YES! END IT NOW! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH! IF YOU CAN'T KILL YOURSELF AT LEAST PUT YOUR READERS OUT OF THEIR MISERY! END THIS AWFUL BOOK!<br />Eventually, without a whimper, without a twist, without the unexpected we've come to expect from Iain Banks, without anything clever, arch or redeeming, the Song of Stone fizzles out.<br />Then I noticed the dedication. Now would you dedicate a book of so heavily saturated in decay, degradation and incest to your PARENTS?anything clever, arch or redeeming, the Song of Stone fizzles out.<br />Then I noticed the dedication.

I hadn't read a Tom Sharpe book in maybe ten years, but what I remember were absurd but still gruesomely funny, bawdy adventures in the world of slapstick (the episode in The Throwback with the prophylactic, the oven cleaner and the cheese grater remains one of the funniest things I've ever read).<br />Well, I stumbled upon Vintage Stuff in an charity shop the other day and thought I'd give it a go for old times' sake.<br />I wish I hadn't bothered. Tom Sharpe's literary star has waned of late (having reached its zenith in the early Eighties), and reading this book it isn't hard to see why.<br />The thing about slapstick - and Sharpe should know this, as he's a (past) master at it - is to exaggerate and caricature; extrapolate and inflate, but never so as to totally break the bounds of credibility. There need to be scenes and situations which any of us might find ourselves in, and only the unusual confluence of all of them at once suggests this could never really happen in real life.<br />In Vintage Stuff, this simply isn't the case. Even the premise is ridiculous, and the decisions, behaviour and reactions of all the characters are plainly silly, without ever hinting at being funny. Sharpe's writing style, usually so light, is leaden; the dialogue isn't credible and the denouement is both unpleasant and anticlimactic. You may spy also a rather spiteful, laboured, resentment of the public school system.<br />This has all the hallmarks of an empty barrel being scraped. Avoid.	2002-06-10

Generally speaking, if you know all the lyrics to Animals, can quote the dead parrot sketch and can hum David Gilmour's guitar solos, you will be able to recite the titles of all Oolon Colluphid's groundbreaking metaphysical tracts about God, too. Yes, you. You know who you are.<br />I have a few complaints about the way it all ends up, but I better get in the bouquets while the going is good: all my quibbling below is not to detract from the fact that the original instalment, The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy, is one of the wittiest books ever written - the combination of a solid science fiction grounding (Adams scriptwrote for Doctor Who) and dead-eye observations about the collision of the British way of life with the Nineteen Seventies, make this little book one of the genuine cultural artefacts of the past century.<br />Nevertheless, and rather as it has for Floyd and Python, universal admiration for Adams (recently deceased) and the first book has tended to cloud the collective judgment as far as the rest of the series is concerned. While Adams is clearly a master of the dead-ball, the entire package is a pretty tiring affair, as if it were a good idea which ran out of steam about halfway through. Which, according to Adams himself, it was.<br />If you read even the first three stories back to back a few things begin to emerge. Firstly, the original (and undeniably brilliant) premise has completely evaporated by the end of the second book. Until this point the story drifts from set piece to set piece, but is guided fairly firmly by the central quest. When this runs out of gas, the linear narrative disappears, and the characters drift pointlessly between scenes with no apparent connection. What starts out as a clever concept album ends up as a sketch show. As long as the sketches are funny this is ok, if not necessarily ideal. But they too begin to run out of steam.<br />Whenever Adams needs to restore a semblance of continuity, he reintroduces Marvin the Paranoid Android, who turns up having been stuck somewhere for millions of years (waiting to save the author's bacon?): no bad thing, as Marvin is the most enjoyable character of the lot. Adams obviously realised the mess he'd created by the end of Life, The Universe and Everything: So Long and Thanks For All The Fish is an attempt to pull everything back together. Alas, it's wholly unsuccessful. So unsuccessful, in fact, that Adams felt obliged to have another go at the same job in Mostly Harmless, and was equally unsuccessful second time round.<br />After a time you also begin to realise that Adams' famously brilliant writing style consists largely of taking figures of speech and deliberately subverting them - a technique which after a while, to paraphrase it, more or less exactly fails to please the eye. By So Long..., Adams is rather arch about the whole affair - consciously introducing &quot;the chronicler&quot; into proceedings and on one occasion (not a little arrogantly) telling readers to re-read a seemingly incomprehensible sentence, until it is understood.<br />The series certainly gave him the chance to work on his storytelling, and the results are plain to see from Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, which is a superbly plotted, focussed and realised story. But, rather like his characters, for the most part in this Series Adams flounders around with the Answer, but never really gets to grips with the Question.

In terms of presentation, the cover of my edition cites - twice - professional reviewers witless enough to use the cliche \\"a tour de force\\".<br />Nor does the style of Pears' opening chapter bode well: while, granted, he is adopting the literary style of a foppish seventeenth century Italian, that style is long-winded and flat: For example, this is the second sentence in the whole book: \\"I wish to recount the journey which I made to England in the year 1663, the events which I witnessed and the people I met, these being, I hope, of some interest to those concerned with curiosity\\". Goodness me. Can this carry on? I found myself immediately checking how many pages there were in the book (698) and wondering whether proceeding was wise.<br />Well, I did go on, and am thoroughly glad I did. Pears' style settles down quickly - it's still deliberately pompous, but that's part of the charm, and also the key to the extraordinary characterisation.<br />The novel takes the form of four very different accounts of the same set of events surrounding a death, a trial, and some seemingly unrelated political intrigue. Each of the four narrators is brilliantly rendered, his beliefs, prejudices, conceptions and misconceptions woven ever-so-subtly in to the text of the account. There is no definitive version of the story, - each narrator makes obvious blunders in his analysis - which makes the novel curiously post-modern, given that it's set in 1663.<br />Almost all the characters are drawn from history, as to an extent is the plot, and there are any number of in-jokes and esoteric references which would make this book worth rereading - as would the fact that the plot is thoroughly Byzantine - I feel certain I have missed half of what was going on just through not being able to keep up.<br />Pears writes playfully and enjoys teasing his reader - he has his final narrator remark, with no small irony intended re his own position, I'm sure, \\"the activities of the long-since dead became my greatest consolation....Being so ill at ease with my own times, I seek refuge in the past...\\".<br />Everything goes a bit, er, pear-shaped at the very death, at which point Pears needs to manufacture an unsatisfactory quasi-spiritual explanation for one of the characters, and in the end he can only finally tie up the loose end by dropping the proverbial ten-ton weight on that character and sending her off on a ship to Massachusetts. But otherwise an extremely, learned, delightful book.ator remark, with no small irony intended re his own position, I'm sure, \\"the activities of the long-since dead became my greatest consolation....Being so ill at ease with my own times, I seek refuge in the past...\\".  <br />Everything goes a bit, er, pear-shaped at the very death, at which point Pears needs to manufacture an unsatisfactory quasi-spiritual explanation for one of the characters, and in the end he can only finally tie up the loose end by dropping the proverbial ten-ton weight on that character and sending her off on a ship to Massachusetts.

The Airport bookshop, of course, is long on low-end pop fiction and Lord of the Rings colouring-in books, but short on quality reading. But wait! when all seems lost, I spy (ahem) John Le Carre's new book snuggled away in a corner on the bottom shelf by, as if ordered by accident. This is more like it. Smiley. Bearskin-hatted border guards patrolling checkpoints. Espionage. The Constant Gardener is has to be.<br />Well, despite a 36 hour kick-start, I took a month to finish the Constant Gardener. It's not especially long, and I'm not an especially slow reader. But it failed to grab me, and the last half was an effort to get through.<br />Two main gripes: firstly, it's frightfully self-righteous. I can't stand books which preach, and Le Carre (via his poorly drawn characters) launches into sermons against multi-nationalism, capitalism and the 'fat god of profit' every ten pages. It's tiring enough when non-fiction writers do this; but when you're writing fiction - and explicitly disclaiming any resemblance to fact - it's completely pointless. And even when you grant Le Carre time on his high-horse, once he's in the saddle he's not even clever about it. You would think a writer this good has all kinds of literary and figurative devices at his disposal to gently infuse an unwelcome message into a skeptical head such as mine, but instead he beats me over the head with awkward dialogues in which the protagonists vent their consciences - or Le Carre's - in reasoned paragraphs. Thanks for the lecture, but I'll pass.<br />Secondly as a story, it doesn't work. Without wishing to give too much away, by about half way through, it is obvious that there can't be a happy ending unless Le Carre is prepared to completely forgo credibility, and after another quarter it becomes apparent there's not going to be much of an ending at all. Within sight of the end, I found myself thinking, \\"how on earth is he going to finish this off in fifteen pages?\\"<br />Answer: he doesn't. Astoundingly, Le Carre abandons the narrative altogether and rounds up the denouement, virtually in bullet points, over a page and a half at the end - rather in the style of a \\"based on a true story\\" TV movie which tells you, in captions, what happened next to the protagonists you have just watched, as if he finally tired of the whole project, or hit a deadline, and gave it away. After a month doggedly wading (paddling?) through this book, I felt a little short changed.<br />To summarise: It's poorly paced, the characters aren't well drawn, the author is obsessed with hackneyed liberal causes that John Pilger has done to death, and it's not much of a yarn into the bargain either.<br />If only I'd gone for that Lord of the Rings colouring-in book...lf thinking, \\"how on earth is he going to finish this off in fifteen pages?\\"<br />Answer: he doesn't.

If you think that life in a Wall Street firm is really like this - these days, at any rate - think again. If you want a really salacious dirt disher, only well written - try Michael Lewis' Liars' Poker, on which the format of this book was surely based. FIASCO is a thoroughly inferior product.<br /><br />Not only is it poorly written, it suffers from the fact that its author seems to have had very little understanding of what he was doing when employed at Morgan Stanley - this is apparent from simply reading his own explanations of the transactions. Mind you, this is no more than you'd expect from a junior associate who'd been on the derivatives desk for a very short period of time - investment banking is a difficult business (if it wasn't, people wouldn't get paid so much to do it) and it takes years to fully understand what is going on, let alone to get any good at it. And that's something this author never allowed himself the time to do. If he had (and was any good), my guess is he'd still be doing the job, rather than writing the kiss and tell expose.<br /><br />Still this silly book sells - but maybe the writing's on the wall: right now, some clunker ex-Enron employee is probably writing the successor in line to FIASCO, only about Enron.

As for format, well - with current technology you're never going to lose an evening curled up by the fire delighting in the texture of the digital interface under your fingertips, but as a research tool the potential for this CD is enormous. Sure, you can't savour the onionskin pages, but nor do you have to walk up and down a book case the length of a city block hunting down the right volume to look up 'oat'. And there is something perversely satisfying in knowing someone once chopped his what-not off so you could have this knowledge at your finger tips. Sort of.<br />But that said, the realisation of the potential isn't terrific. The default word search function is narrow - woe betide should you assume a plural: search on 'oats', and the full, digital version of the twenty-two volume Oxford English Dictionary will announce: 'no entries found'. To me, that's pretty stunning.<br />The better approach is to use the full text search, but this is buried in an obscure tab at the bottom of the screen, and it took me quite a few goes before I even noticed it. Full text search allows you to search on an text in the definition, which is where the real strength of a CD-ROM version lies. But even this is limited - only a certain amount of Boolean searching is possible, where a simple 'google' style search engine would allow far more flexibility in customising searches.<br />But for me, the biggest drawback of this product is having to have the CD-ROM actually occupying your CD player the whole time you use the dictionary.<br />At the best of time, CD-ROMs orbit my computer according to the laws of quantum mechanics and never actually exist in any given place at any given time - their whereabouts can only be described in terms of probabilities. So having to suddenly locate a given CD-ROM in a given place at a given time presents certain epistemological difficulties.<br />And besides, if I fancy a spot of dictionary browsing of an evening, there's nothing I like better than some light music to go with it. Even if I correctly predict the whereabouts of said CD-ROM, I then have to turf the Inkspots' Greatest Hits out of the CD tray and browse in silence.<br />Do I worry?

This is a worthy but not spectacular biography.<br />It thoroughly traces Dylan's love-life, recordings, concert tours and activities right up to the tour following Time Out Of Mind, but is less penetrating on the content of his work. The claims this author makes - to have uncovered startling new evidence (in the form of a marriage certificate!!) that Bob Dylan secretly got married in the eighties, are not as interesting as Sounes thinks they are.<br />Down The Highway is well written without being stylish - Sounes is no Greil Marcus or Charles Shaar Murray, and nor does he try to be - but his weakness is that he holds Bob Dylan in the sort of admiring regard which is ok if you're a fan, but irritating if you're a biographer. For example, Sounes spends a lot of time arguing the uncontroversial assertion - almost to the point of being defensive about it - that Dylan really is one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Now whether you like Dylan or not, his significance as an artist really isn't debatable, so this is wasted energy. Sounes is also prepared to defend, in some way or other, every one of Dylan's albums, despite acknowledging that many in the late seventies and early eighties were critical and commercial failures. A more dispassionate writer might just face facts - Even Bob Dylan is capable of an iredeemably bad record. Again, this is something which the rest of the world would not dispute.<br />For all that, Sounes does catalogue all the nasty and unpleasant things Dylan has done in his life (as well as the nice ones), and while this obviously hasn't affected his opinion of the man, it made sobering reading for me. Mahatma Ghandi Dylan is not.<br />But the most interesting and valuable aspect of Sounes' portrayal was that Dylan never, even in the early days, was particularly political, nor did he consider himself a protest singer. His heroes were the same as everyone else's - Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly - he just happened to like Woody Guthrie too. In the end, in making music Bob Dylan was just trying to make a living - his famous self description as &quot;just a song-and-dance man&quot; may not have been intended as ironically as the world suspected.ike Woody Guthrie too.

And the Essex was not the only whale boat to sink, nor even was it the only one to get rammed by a whale. Nor is N. Philbrick the only man to have written about this particular ship: leaving aside Herman Melville, Philbrick acknowledges and cites at length from three other authors who have written on the same subject, and two of them were actually on board.<br />So while the book rips along at a jaunty pace, and is a pleasant enough read, it's never clear what its raison d'etre is, other than to cash in on the current appetite for strange but true tales about quirky but forgetten strugglers against the conventions and odds of history (you know, Fermat's Theorem, Longitude, that sort of thing).<br />The learned author also fails to even consider, let alone answer, the point that, if the great offshore whaling grounds were in the South Pacific, why - instead of sailing there, around South America, from the New York region, didn't the Natucketers just up sticks and move to California? Would have saved them a lot of time, you'd think, not to mention the aggravation of rounding Cape Horn.<br />A worthy enough effort, but it is a bit pointless, and inevitably it pales into comparison with Moby Dick.	2002-02-08

Gloriously, delightfully, and devastatingly accurate caricatures by the great Ronald Searle bring to life the hysterical adventures of the fearsome, loathsome nigel molesworth, the curse of st. custards, his grate frend peason, the oiks, cads, MASTERS and of course his own bro molesworth II chiz chiz chiz. the late author, Geoff Willans, was an for a short time a schoolmaster, and he obviously recorded EVERYTHING he saw while he was at it.<br />Maybe it's larking on an esoteric subject you have to have experienced to see the funny side - in which case it would be totally lost on those outside the English grammar school system of twenty years ago and more - but for my money there is no funnier book around. What's more I think JK Rowling owes Willans and Searle a debt - surely it is no coincedence that she named her legendary school of wizardry and witchcraft &quot;Hogwarts&quot; after a fictional Molesworthian Latin play?<br />Totally, utterly recommended.	2001-11-20

The story is simple enough: I don't think it's what the characters do as much as what they stand for which interests Greene - for this reason the protagonists are not especially lifelike: Pinky is all brooding, anti-social and violent; absent even a hint of redemption (Greene uses the word 'poisoned' a lot in relation to Pinky), whereas Ida is drawn as a libertine Dickensian harlot whose only motivating moral is the pursuit of fun ' and, somewhat incongruously, really ' justice, for the forsaken Hale. The opposing forces or good and evil are far too contrary to have been meant to be taken at face value.<br />For all the solemnity of Greene's main object, at times he pulls some surprises: just when the going begins to get truly rough, there is a delightfully comic scene involving a lecherous but repressed lawyer that had me laugh out loud. I haven't seen the film version, but the lawyer, Prewitt would be a peach of a part for some hammy old Shakespearean actor fancying a break into the big time.<br />The narrative didn't really rivet me; Greene's writing is a bit too artful to be truly exciting, and in places I found Brighton Rock rather too easy to put down. Having said that, what I really admired were the backlights and figurative plays with which Greene makes his point - they exist alongside the plot, so that Greene can say his piece without having to shoehorn it into the story as bluntly as a lesser author might.	2001-10-28

The book is thoroughly researched and beautifully written - as befits the story of a beautiful writer - and, to his credit, de Rogatis avoids the temptation to imitate the inimitable style of his subject, instead playing the narrative with a refreshingly straight bat and deriding those acolytes of Bangs who, without the wit or perspicacity, attempted to ape his approach to writing. This rather dispassionate voice does give credibility to the undertaking and, by association, its subject. The author is plainly a fan of Lester Bangs, but he isn't a sycophant, and he is prepared to give a damning assessment where he sees fit. This he does to Lester's unpublished (apparently deservedly so) opus, \\"Rock Gomorrah\\".<br />Bangs' story is pretty much classic, almost cliched, rock `n' roll. What struck me most was how interchangeable many parts of it were with the established legends of the rock `n' roll pantheon - without having that special \\"something\\" which makes a rock `n' roll star, nor the guile to realise it, Lester's life observing those who did was part Elvis, part Sid Vicious, part Hendrix; from a religious fundy upbringing right up to the indeterminate cause of death - just weeks after he had apparently turned the corner and cleaned up. And what of the shadow of the new romantics across the scene? It was a Human League record spinning on the turntable when his body was discovered. Rock `n' roll is dead, aye.	2001-10-21

I picked up this Rough Guide to Italy for a brief trip to Umbria and Lazio because my local shop sold out of the Let's Go equivalent.<br />It annoyed me intensely.<br />Firstly, it is unreasonably negative in tone throughout - someone who hadn't been there could be forgiven for thinking Italy is a crummy place with only a few mouldy monuments and the odd fresco to recommend it, which as a general impression is criminally wrong, and it's astounding that a guidebook should set out to give it. P>Secondly, Some of the maps aren't accurate and don't appear to have been checked or proof read. Throwaway lines such as \\"[the tourist office has] lots of reasonable but characterless rooms on their books and appartments to rent\\" on the basis of my anecdotal evidence simply aren't fair -<br />Thirdly it's dreadfully turgid. Cheeky charm in a guide of this sort is obligatory these days, but the writing style is frequently leaden. Witness the following insight, which is typically put: \\"Of all Italy's historic cities, it's perhaps Rome which exerts the most compelling fascination.\\" Good grief.<br />Plus points - the \\"contexts\\" section, which overviews art, architecture, history, and the political and social set-up in italy (you know, the mafia, camorra and all that good stuff!), is a good read. There are plenty of maps of little places, too, but they're not collosally accurate. There are a few fairly uninteresting colour pics, but for my money they could have been left out and a buck shaved off the cover price.<br />There must be better guides to Italy than this.	2001-09-17

This short book was featured in the Observer (a UK Sunday Newspaper) Literary Supplement in August 2001. In substance it's little more than an extended lit crit essay, with a bit of speculative history thrown in (as the author reminds us time and again, Harris talks to no man, and he is no exception).<br />By and large this work does what Sexton wants it to - that is, to open the reader's eyes to a deeper, more sophisticated Thomas Harris than one might expect from the melodramatic (Sexton's term) serial thriller genre that Harris seems happy to sit in. Sexton certainly succeeds in that and the strands he draws out of Poe, Stoker, Conan Doyle are fascinating, if not totally compelling.<br />BUT ... having said that, Sexton's range of references is pretty eclectic - in its literary tradition, Hannibal apparently derives from the three said potboilers and - um - Baudelaire!! (and the inevitable dash if Nietzsche, if I recall) but no-one else. Some of the links to these antecedents are pretty tenuous, which makes you wonder exactly how much homework Sexton did do - what, for example, might he have discovered if he'd done a compare and contrast on the Marquis de Sade as well? Or the Brothers Grimm? He makes great reference to the &quot;Hannotations&quot; website, where some poor obsessive has gone through Harris' latest (Hannibal) line by line uncovering obscure and extraordinary cross references in the text. This may be a worthwhile enterprise (after all, Harris spent ten years writing the book, so maybe he did concentrate on the text at this level) but I doubt it. Rather surprisingly there's not much in Sexton's book which doesn't appear on the web site - read from that what you will about the depth of Sexton's research.<br />Sexton's fervent defence of Harris against all comers - especially in re Hannibal - smacks of untempered adulation: Having heard him out, I'm still not convinced that Hannibal wasn't the flat out clunker its many detractors suggest. Harris may be a literary genius - but on the same evidence may just be a mildly sociopathic saddo - and Sexton's arguments for the former aren't especially persuasive.<br />Finally, Sexton's suggestion that Harris is the only decent writer of gothic melodrama (or any other popular fiction today, for that matter) is just silly - it leads one to wonder whether Sexton's shallow research isn't simply matched by the breadth of his holiday reading.e a literary genius - but on the same evidence may just be a mildly sociopathic saddo - and Sexton's arguments for the former aren't especially persuasive. <br />Finally, Sexton's suggestion that Harris is the only decent writer of gothic melodrama (or any other popular fiction today, for that matter) is just silly - it leads one to wonder whether Sexton's shallow research isn't simply matched by the breadth of his holiday reading.	2001-09-17

It's tough viewing the book except in terms of the film - just try to imagine Jack Vincennes without seeing Kevin Spacey wearing a very sharp cream jacket dusting blood of his lapel... not possible.<br />Ellroy doesn't mince, or waste words. It's difficult to adjust to his sparse style: abbreviated constructions abound, and the only thing it's liberally studded with is 50s crime slang - authentic enough sounding buzzwords which I couldn't be entirely sure Ellroy hadn't just made up. I mean, what on earth is a &quot;hink&quot;?<br />It's a curious thing - Ellroy is so consciously hip, so &quot;in&quot; in his language and expressions you can't help but be seduced into the air of authenticity whereas, if you stake a step back, the whole damn book is so outrageously contrived that it could not conceivably be anything of the sort.<br />Ellroy would have you believe that virtually every figure in the book, from a Mexican university student through the Hollywood scene, the gossip sheet reporters, a collection of pornographers, some bad dudes in a Purple Mercury, a vice ring, a plastic surgeon, a child serial killer, the District Attorney, every ranking officer in the police and prison service and most of the Italian contigent of California are all tangentially linked to a botched shooting in an all night diner. And its all to do with horse. You know, &quot;H&quot;. And Prostitutes. And tying up Mickey Cohen's vice racket. And a nasty Police Captain. Ans so it goes on.<br />The film excised about half of this material, and compressed it down from a ten year period, and it still seemed far fetched.<br />For all that, though, once you are on message with Ellroy's slang, L.A. Confidential rips along, ideal holiday reading, which I suppose is all the Crime genre can really aspire to.	2001-02-22

Every word was the truth.&quot;<br />Well, no. The reason was that every subject to which Goldman seriously took his scythe (here Lennon and Epstein and elsewhere Elvis Presley) was dead. It is a principle of defamation law around the world that you can't slander the dead.<br />The same reader also said, &quot;Goldman took rock biography into the realms of serious literature. No other rock writer except Lester Bangs even comes close.&quot; Absolute nonsense. Not only does Goldman's work not even pretend to be serious literature, the field of rock writing is well endowed with outstanding literature. There are too many to mention.<br />As for this book, well, it's true Albert Goldman aims deliberately, maliciously below the belt, and he hits hard. It's also true his (deceased) subjects cannot hit back. My guess is he is right as often as he is wrong, but inevitably it's impossible to judge; you have to take - or refuse, as you see fit - the author's word for it.<br />The Lives of John Lennon is a very entertaining book to read, unless one of your sacred cows happens to be John Lennon. It also works on a far more important level: somehow (mostly by dint of getting shot) Lennon has acquired amongst people who should know better cult status as some sort of Messianic perfect citizen of the world. He was nothing of the sort. He was frequently a horrible little man. Imagine, far from being a defining anthem of our time, is a vaccuous and hypocritical pile of tripe.<br />Albert Goldman, for all his insidiousness and for all his trite attempts to be highbrow, makes these points very well indeed.	2001-01-25

I have a renewed respect fo JK Rowling's talent as a writer - not for her plot or her imaginative universe, but her simple ability to construct an elegant sentence. Reading out loud is a tremendous test of that aspect of a writer's craft. Both the Philosopher's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets are a pleasure to say. I cannot say that. however, of the Goblet of Fire does not. Rowling's prose is noticeably more leaden and convoluted. It is weighed down with unnecessary modifiers. There are thickets of uninteresting incidental details which get in the way of the plot's progression. This is a far less \\"writerly\\" effort. I wonder whether the demands of the publisher's schedule became overwhelming, for it feels verily like the sub-editing stage has been skipped on this book. To such a point that I don't think I can bring myself to start the next one.<br /><br />(I have downgraded my rating).<br /><br />***Original Review***<br /><br />After three books you couldn't help noticing a pretty rigid plot formula in the Harry Potter books: Harry starts out in Privet Drive, goes to Hogwarts, singlehandedly wins a vital Quidditch match, encounters either a mysterious but seemingly friendly character who turns out (a) to have an anagram for a name and (b) be in the service of Voldemort, but eventually manages to save the day, without completely squashing you-know-who.<br /><br />The good news is that while not abandoning her idiom, in The Goblet of Fire JK Rowling has allowed herself to drift loose of these moorings and evolve Harry's world: the wizarding universe is significantly different at the end of this book than it was at the beginning. You couldn't say that about the first three.<br /><br />With each book Rowling has developed her literary aspirations: the Goblet of Fire is pretty baroque compared to the roughly-hewn Philosopher's Stone. I think she manages to stay the right side of the self-indulgence line, though: it remains to be seen whether Rowling can resist the temptation to stray over it next time round.<br /><br />Rowling's instinctive gift for storytelling is generally absorbing but is by no means perfect: at the end there is some fairly ham-fisted dialogue that exists only for plot exposition. While she isn't the first writer to lean on this particular shovel (Conan-Doyle's Dr Watson character existed almost exclusively to allow Sherlock Holmes to explain parts of the plot Conan-Doyle couldn't be bothered setting out properly) this doesn't mean it isn't a flaw. Ultimately Harry Potter is a wonderful creation, and such sales are an achievement which cannot be explained away as a product of canny marketing or sheer fluke. But this early on, nor can you properly gauge how Harry stacks up against Bilbo Baggins or Aslan the Lion.

He's an  obsessive, passionate, academic lover of rock 'n' roll in all its many  forms. Here he sketches out a book structured in a loose fashion like the  bible, in that it has an &quot;old testament&quot; surveying two of rock's  'ancestors' and a &quot;new testament&quot; on five of their 'inheritors'.  It's a book about rock 'n' roll. In short, Marcus waxes long and with great  hyperbole on things which most grown ups in this day and age find rather  trifling.<br />Well, I don't, and I think this is a fantastic book. It's  subjects are eclectic as can be: Robert Johnson is a reasonable enough  choice for &quot;ancestor of the rock 'n' roll tradition&quot; but it would  be a brave man who would pick one-man band &quot;Harmonica Frank&quot;  Floyd, from Toccopola Mississippi, as the other. But Marcus does, and  creates a fascinating case for his inclusion.<br />The threads he picks up of  rock iconography are incredible - the myth of Stagger Lee, blended into the  history of Sly Stone was something I'd never heard of, but it prompted me  to head off in that direction and see what I could find. Likewise the short  chapter on Robert Johnson.<br />In a lot of ways, that's the beauty of this  book: For all its obsession-shot prose, it functions as a bunch of  references; directions which the reader can follow up at leisure, and  Marcus's effervescent writing style functions like a firm push between the  shoulder blades. The bibliography is almost as long as the text, and it's  well worth the read.<br />There are some who find Marcus' style too garish,  and there is a view that he is too much of a boffin - an anorak, if you  will - for his own good. I don't agree with that - Marcus is self-aware  enough to see the funny side of himself and his subject matter, and he is  always so enthusiastic that it isn't fair to say he misses the point, or  the energy, of what he's writing about.<br />Marcus' later work, especially on  punk rock, is well worth investigating too. Don't believe the nay-sayers  who don't like his &quot;straying&quot; into punk: &quot;In the Fascist  Bathroom&quot;, Marcus' anthology of essays on punk rock is one of the  funniest, most compelling reads I've had in a long while., or  the energy, of what he's writing about.<br />Marcus' later work, especially on  punk rock, is well worth investigating too.

MASON, YOU IDIOT,  LECTER'S THE GOOD GUY. EVERY VILLAIN KNOWS YOU DON'T TIE UP THE GOOD GUY  AND LEAVE HIM TO DIE WHILE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.<br />#3. the orange motif,  which recurred over and over again was just silly. Moths are creepy. Lambs  screaming are creepy. ORANGES AREN'T CREEPY.<br />There. That's my bit said.	2000-07-16

This is a rip-snorting read - delivered in punchy three minutes bursts of exhilarating energy. Much of Nietszche can, for today's eyes, be pretty impnenetrable stuff (Thus Spake  Zarathustra, for example, is a tough read: a bit like Freddie's old  sparring partner Dickie Wagner, it has wonderful moments, but some dreadful  half hours), but The Antichrist suffers no such lag: Here Continental  philosophy's very own Johnny Rotten puts it all together, buzzsawing  headlong through the sacred cows, and BOY the band is on song. This is a  deconstruction, not of God, not even of the Bible, but of Christanity AS  practiced. And what a demolition job it is. Make no mistake, this is no  points victory; it's a rout. Christianity has NEVER been beaten up this  badly before, but it has never had to fight according to the rules. OK, I'm  changing metaphors here, now - Nietzsche is Mohammed Ali, dancing around  the Ring (sorry Dickie W, no pun intended) taunting this corpulent, drugged  up, pale, pasty opponent, darting in with a vicious jab, ducking out again.  There's blood on the floor. The fall guy never stands a chance. Champion of  the World, Nietzsche glistens, fizzes, grandstands, and struts round the  ring, belt held high above his head, while someone wipes the floor up and  bundles off the poor Christian dude to get his face fixed up - it's  beautiful, its systematic, and it's unanswerable. But most of all  it is so  stylish, even in translation. I could quote some of this boiling invective,  but I fear it may upset delicate sensibilities. Wonderful stuff!	2000-07-16

Will Hutton is quoted on the cover of this book that \\"we needed a powerful challenge to the simple-minded advocates of globalisation,\\" which is certainly true, but exactly where it leaves Gray's book, a sadly simple-minded challenge, is not clear. An original thinker Mr. Gray may be; a thorough and dispassionate one he is not. He sets his stall with an analysis of a number of experiments in free-marketism, and his especially critical of the reforms which took place in New Zealand under David Lange's Labour Government and then Jim Bolger's National one between 1984 and 1995.<br /><br />I have two bones to pick with Mr. Gray's polemic: Firstly, in his entire analysis of the New Zealand situation, Mr. Gray quotes just one author, Jane Kelsey.<br /><br />In any circumstances, that's lazy journalism, let alone academic writing. That is, unless Mr. Gray has in fact done his homework, but has been unable to find another academic to support his arguments. In which case it's disingenuo!us writing. Let's give Mr. Gray the benefit of the doubt. He's lazy.<br /><br />But if he's lazy, he's also managed to have picked a rather singular commentator on whom to base his analysis. Jane Kelsey is, to put it mildly, a controversial commentator. Her views have very little subscription within New Zealand even at an academic level, let alone on the high-street. That Mr. Gray feels compelled to take Kelsey's word as gospel, while ignoring everyone else's, is nothing short of dumbfounding.<br /><br />My second objection is personal: I was there, in New Zealand, the entire time the social revolution took place. Mr. Gray was, obviously, not. He patently has no experience of the New Zealand experiment outside Ms Kelsey's writings on the subject. The most stunning example of this is his quote, direct from Kelsey that \\"in the space of a decade a strong central authority, operating with almost total disregard for democratic process and pluralist politics, abetted by a private sector eli!te, revolutionised New Zealand's economy and its peoples lives\\". First time I read this I assumed this must be a misplaced reference to the Rob Muldoon's near Marxist regime, which culminated in 1984 with the election of the Lange Labour Government (the one with which Mr. Gray takes such umbrage). But bizarrely, Kelsey was actually referring to David Lange's Labour Government AND Jim Bolger's subsequent National one, which between them took ten years putting right the economic devastation which Muldoon had wrought. Muldoon's stewardship was so horrific that, to prevent the economy collapsing totally he had, for three years LEGISLATED a total ban on increases in wages or prices. It's stunning (but par for the course) that Kelsey should lament the loss of that, and distressing that Gray, albeit though his inattention, should support it.<br /><br />To my mind such shoddy groundwork completely subverts any legitimacy the remainder of the book might otherwise have. If Gray's analysis i!s that shallow in his groundwork, how poor must it be in the core of his argument?<br /><br />I'm still waiting for the powerful challenge.Zealand's economy and its peoples lives\\".

I bought Excession partly on the strength of Banks' 'straight' fiction (especially The Wasp Factory), but mostly because it was the only English language book on the  shelves of the Venetian bookshop in which I found it. The outward signs  were not good: the edition I purchased is illustrated with one of those  ghastly airbrushed spaceships favoured by the direst of pulp sci-fi  publishers. But one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Nor did I have  foreknowledge of Bank's &quot;Culture&quot;, the parallel universe he has  developed for his science fiction titles, a potential handicap given this  is about the fifth in the series. It turned out not to matter.<br />Excession  had me from the start. This is proper literature which, as such, leaves  Arthur C Clarke and E E &quot;Doc&quot; Smith for dead. The ideas in it are  out of Clarke's league, too. There's something cinematic about the  narrative, cutting and diving between figures and dialogues (the  communications between the ships are especially fascinating) as Banks  unravels, surely and deliberately, the plot. It's challenging - not a word  in the 451 pages is wasted, and you can not afford to casually flick  through a couple of pages. Fortunately, you never feel the need to. Readers  of his straight fiction will know Banks' particular gift for story telling:  it is put to even better use here. After fifty pages you know you're in the  hands of a master - a fine, wicked, playful master at that.<br />Banks' only  concession to the genre is to give his humanoid characters silly names,  such as Dajeil Gelian and (&amp; I'm not kidding) Sikleyr-Najasa Croepice  Ince Stahl da Mapin. Knowing Banks' style, however, this is probably some  sort of in-joke that I don't get, so the laugh's most likely on me for  missing it. His spaceships, which are delightfully sentient, all get  terrific names, on the other hand, such as The Problem Child and Fate  Amenable to Change. Cool. Great book - ideal holiday reading; excellent for  a 15 hour ferry trips from Bari to Igoumenitsa.ange. Cool.

US	52000095	R23NLWXXEXU752	0345379187	76135912	Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium	Books	3	69	123	N	N	A duff note to go out on...	I'm a big fan of Carl Sagan. I loved the `Cosmos' series, I thought `The Demon Haunted World' was an outstanding treatise on really important subject, and I really dug the movie `Contact'. I have only respect for his  views the role and value of science and rational thought in everyone's  daily life. So I looked forward to `Billions and Billions', his last work  before his sad death a couple of years ago.<br />Well, while much of the book  is true to form, in parts I was a little disappointed. For the first time,  and maybe exactly because of his own dreadful circumstances, Sagan allows  himself to stray from his stock material, - matters scientific and logical,  where he's pretty unarguably right - to matters where, to my mind, he isn't  - matters moral and political. So his chapters on the crises facing the  world, all of which start out nicely enough, start introducing solutions  which have a cloying, left wing, aroma to them.<br />To my reading of it,  Sagan's basic thesis is that we (the proles) can't sort out the world's  problems by ourselves, so we need a panel of wise men to legislate them  away for us. That's a pile of old rope. Frankly, I have yards more  confidence in the judgment (collectively) of the \\"man on the Clapham  omnibus\\" than of any politicians (and I don't think the latter in any  meaningful way represents the former), so I don't buy Sagan's argument at  all.<br />But what bugs me is the unspoken intellectual imperialism of it.  \\"Not only are there Wise Men who must make critical decisions for you\\",  implies Sagan, \\"but they are people like Me.\\" Well, sorry, but as anyone  who has done a Bachelor's degree will know, the only people worse equipped  than politicians to make judgments on behalf of the rest of us are people  who spend their lives hanging out at places like Cornell University.<br />As a  result Sagan starts sounding less like the completely dispassionate  scientist and more like your common or garden sci-fi writer - his  conceptions of how useful an idea government is aren't far off the loopy  ones Arthur C Clark used to trundle out in his potboilers: you know, where,  in  five hundred years, finally the human race will Get It Right and we'll  all live happily ever after.<br />Call me cynical, but it don't work like  that. Given the history of science, a scientist of Sagan's calibre ought to  know that.ions of how useful an idea government is aren't far off the loopy  ones Arthur C Clark used to trundle out in his potboilers: you know, where,  in  five hundred years, finally the human race will Get It Right and we'll  all live happily ever after. <br />Call me cynical, but it don't work like  that.

Anyone who claims to have heard of this book other than through Kubrick's film \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is most likely lying. It's an unremarkable novella (it's really short - a  page shy of 100 pages) and its author, Schnitzler,  was a member of Freud's circle in Vienna in the early part of last century.  That, so far as I can tell, would be his only claim to fame. Were it not  for Kubrick's film, there almost certainly would not be a penguin edition  (i.e. \\"first published 1926, this edition 1999\\"). The plot of \\"Eyes Wide  Shut\\" is a very close lift, but the film works in subtexts, rationales,  themes and dramatic tension which Schnitzler completely fails to exploit.  What is remarkable is that Kubrick can have been so perspicacious to see as  clever a film as \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is such an ordinary book. The  characterisation is wafer thin and the plot makes unreasonable demands of  credulity. Well, it does of mine, anyway. Plus points: the Penguin  translation's pretty good, and it'll be all over an hour after you've  started.  But if you're looking for something to curl up with on the Orient  Express, think again.	2000-04-28

There's enough corporate intrigue, maniacal boardroom posturing, gulfstream abuse and small men with big egos in these riveting 600 pages to knock even the Ewing family of Dallas into a cocked hat. From the beginning Burrough draws you into the  preposterousness of what is happening, setting out well drawn  characterisations of each of the main players, flipping between them in  that totally enchanting &quot;meanwhile, in Gotham city&quot; fashion.  Before long the threads are pulling together into a whirling tarantella of  greed assaulting you from every side. It's difficult to work out who's  meant to be the villain, mostly because I think everyone was.  Full grown  men startle for their utter failure in self-reflexion as much as for the  appalling lengths to which they will go in the name of self-interest.<br />The climax is as good as any thriller (I completely missed my stop on  the tube, finally snapping out of a daze thinking, &quot;hey I haven't been  this excited since Jodi Foster went head to head with Buffalo Bill in  Silence Of The Lambs!&quot;).<br />Secondly, and maybe not intentionally,  Barbarians at the Gate is a piercing social/historical commentary  - just  by &quot;telling it like it was&quot; the narrative skewers the eighties,  Wall street and the Reagan years so brutally it might as well be a spit  roast.<br />On this level it is leagues ahead of the celebrated fictional  works which purport to do the same thing. In particular, Brett Ellis'  &quot;American Psycho&quot;, and Tom Wolfe's &quot;A Man in Full&quot;,  fare badly against Burrough's genuine article. I would be amazed of either  Ellis or Wolfe hadn't read this book, but the novels of both are anemic and  implausible in comparison. Barbarians at the Gate is more deadly accurate,  it doesn't exagerrate or caricature the wall street banker like American  Psycho does (and what value is there in caricaturing something which is so  patently ridiculous in itself?), and the plot - needless to say - has a  ring of credibility which is singularly lacking from A Man In  Full.<br />Oddly, the one area where the book falls down a little bit is in  its aspiration (if it has one) to present a sensible, clear, commercial  analysis of what was going on. But that's a trade off - had the Burroughs  taken that route, then surely some of the dramatic impact would have been  lost.<br />As it is, he's produced a cracker.culous in itself?), and the plot - needless to say - has a  ring of credibility which is singularly lacking from A Man In  Full.<br />Oddly, the one area where the book falls down a little bit is in  its aspiration (if it has one) to present a sensible, clear, commercial  analysis of what was going on.

And all this in a little over 200 pages.  Great going!<br />The subject matter isn't easy, but nor (at the level to  which Dunbar takes it) is it rocket science, and to his immense credit  Dunbar manages to resist the temptation to write it off as 'baffling rocket  science by Harvard Graduates which is far too hard for the stupid reader to  understand' (which is what said Channel 4 documentary did) or to insert  unpenetrable graphs, equations and formulae to show just how clever he and  the LTCM sort of person is.<br />Still, while the casual observer of the  Stock Market (you know, the sort who watches the news each night to see if  it went up or down) might find little in this book to light their candle,  those in the industry and short on specific knowledge, or with aspirations  of getting into it, could hardly find a better place to start.	2000-04-11
