With that in mind, the \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Perfect Resume\\" is an interesting and valuable asset.<br /><br />I have usually relied on \\"The Damn Good Resume Guide\\" in various editions and had pretty good luck.  Still, the Idiot's Guide had some styles that I hadn't really seen before.  For example, they have resumes for individuals with specialty degrees and experience and for those who have been high achievers in their field.<br /><br />Two big caveats, however.<br /><br />The Idiot's Guide doesn't seem to be organized in a logical way.  It feels like it jumps around from topic to topic instead of just concentrating on illustrating various resume styles and approaches.  Perhaps that's just the Idiot Guide format and they're just trying to present as much as possible about how to write a resume.  In any case, experienced resume writers will likely find this frustrating if they're mostly just looking for fresh ideas.<br /><br />The second issue I have with this guide is the cover letters section.  Here's one example they give for a first paragraph:  \\"Do you believe in fate?  I didn't until I opened the Sheridan Bee this morning and saw your ad for Job Placement Officer.  It sounded like the job I've been searching for.\\"<br /><br />Maybe this is just personal style issue, but I've been on the hiring end myself and read a few cover letters.  If I saw a letter with that paragraph I'd probably question the job candidate's professionalism.  It just comes off as overly eager with a touch of inexperience.  Granted, this is just one letter in the book.  Still, I found the cover letter section to be one of the weakest chapters and not all that helpful.<br /><br />The Idiot's Guide would probably help a lot of people in creating a better resume.  I recommend it as an addition to one's collection of books on the topic.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone as a sole primary source of information.	2005-06-27

I was specifically looking for another time travel novel.  Having read these two other books on the subject I was looking for another page turner.<br /><br />The author seems to be trying to copy some of the electricity that you might have found in the 80s TV show \\"Moonlighting\\" with Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepherd.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work.  The dialogue is awkward and unrealistic.  To be honest, I read the first 20 or 30 pages and just had to put the book down.<br /><br />I hate giving struggling authors bad reviews.  Still, I can only assume that there are others like me who are always looking for another good time travel novel.  And this novel is heavily marketed in other time travel novel listings here on Amazon.<br /><br />To be blunt, this novel bordered on the cartoonish.  Before I bought this book I tried to find a review by a major magazine or web site.  (A comment from a Houston radio station doesn't count.)  Couldn't find a thing - no Publishers Weekly, no Booklist, nothing.  That should have told me something.<br /><br />If you're careful with your money and only buy books you're going to read I recomend that you first, at the very minimum, find an excerpt of this novel.  Some readers have apparently liked this book.  Before you spend your hard earned money find out first if this a book that's worth your time.  I wished I had.	2005-06-23

We sent five busses that day.  Not too bad given the pre-event threats of arrest after the unreasonable refusal by the city to issue an appropriate permit that would have accomodated the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters.  If we could have assured everyone's safety we probably could have sent 10 busses or maybe even 20!<br /><br />2/15 for me represents much of the reason why I've become disenchanted with the political ineptness of the peace movement and its leaders.  This book is a prime example.<br /><br />On the back cover there's an adpation of the old Margaret Mead quote about people \\"changing the world.\\"  A noble cause, yes.  But to achieve change you need to have  realistic plans and tactics.<br /><br />Take the photos from NYC in this book as a prime example.  In one photo a woman compares Bush to Stalin.  Yes, Bush is a horrible president.  Comparing him to Stalin, a man arguably worse than Hitler, is not just hyperbole, it's complete idiocy.  In another photo is an elderly woman with a sign that reads \\"*&$% Bush.\\"  OK, another understandable sentiment.  But does this win people to our side?<br /><br />The examples go on and on.  The trend is generally obvious - 2/15 wasn't about changing the world or about convincing others to join our side.  It was an expression of anger.  It was a forum where ticked off people could vent and get together with others who felt the same.  While that might make for good therapy and get everyone all riled up and motivated, it does not change anything.  In fact, events based on anger (versus trying to change people's minds) usually result in the exact opposite.  Those who oppose us simply marginalize the movement even more and depict us as out of touch wackos.<br /><br />For once, I just wish the peace movement would focus on actually recruiting undecided Americans to join the cause.  You don't do this through angry street protests.  You do it by reaching out to moderates and conservatives who agree with our dissent.  And yes, they do exist!  But we dismiss them because they're not \\"liberal enough\\" for our tastes.<br /><br />Near the end of \\"2/15\\" is a photo of anarchists with a huge banner that reads \\"*&%$ the Army, *&%$ the Cops.\\"  While this certainly doesn't represent the entire peace movement, not by any stretch, it is telling both that the photo is in this book and that other peace activists are so comfortable in working with groups who would use such rhetoric.<br /><br />Ironically, those who suggest other ways to express ourselves - waving an American flag while protesting the war - are viewed as somehow \\"untrustworthy.\\"  There is no such photo in \\"2/15.\\"  Many within the movement have given up on the flag and the good that it can represent - freedom, democracy and human rights - when in the right hands.  But when you've given up on the flag, you've given up on other Americans.  \\"Changing the world\\" then becomes an automatic impossibility.	2005-06-08

Darby Conley, the artist, seems to be a cross between author Christopher Moore and cartoonist Berkeley Breathed.<br /><br />For years I mourned the loss of \\"Bloom County.\\"  Sure, there were other funny cartoons.  \\"The Far Side\\" was great.  So was \\"Calvin and Hobbes.\\"  \\"Dilbert\\" does bring out a chuckle now and then.  And \\"Opus\\" is back, although not nearly as funny as before.  There was just something about \\"Bloom County,\\" with its combination of humans, talking animals and social satire that made it laugh-out-loud humorous almost on a daily basis.<br /><br />\\"Get Fuzzy\\" has now filled much of the void with the stupidity of Satchell's good hearted nature and Bucky's evil quest to be the boss.<br /><br />\\"Bucky Katt's Big Book of Fun\\" is probably the best book thus far.  I have to ditto another reviewer, however, and warn buyers about Amazon's combining this title with \\"Blueprint for Disaster.\\"  While hardcore readers might want both, buyers should be aware of the fact that much (if not perhaps all, not sure) of the content of \\"Blueprint\\" exists within \\"Big Book of Fun.\\"<br /><br />My only hope is that Darby Conley will continue to grow and develop \\"Get Fuzzy.\\"  As much as I hate to say it, when you look at the book (instead of reading a daily strip) you can see where he sometimes relies on a redundant technique - such as when Rob or Bucky uses a word that Satchell misinterprets in the last frame and this becomes the punchline.  It's funny, but it's not the heart of the \\"Get Fuzzy.\\"<br /><br />No matter, \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is still hiliarious.  If you haven't seen it before you are missing a cartoon strip treasure.	2005-05-31

But Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" stands out as the exception.<br /><br />Sacco shows us what everyday Palestinians experience through his interviews and his simple yet powerful drawings.  It is not \\"propaganda\\" as some would suggest.  It simply shows what people experience under the Israeli occupation.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the critics of this book go after Sacco (and the positive reviewers) because they love Israel or defend its right to exist.  \\"Palestine\\" is mostly about what Israel has done to the Palestinian people.  That is fact.  It is equally factual that some Palestinians have committed horrendous acts of terrorism.  To point out the former does not mean you defend the latter.  To suggest it does is nothing less than childish arrogance.<br /><br />My major beef with Sacco is his lack of aggressiveness on the issue women's rights and Islam.  He gives us a few pages on the topic but these offer very little logic in showing what is ultimately a morally indefensible position - the subjugation of women for religious reasons.<br /><br />Despite this one criticism, and despite the wishes of Sacco's critics, \\"Palestine\\" will likely stand the test of time.  It's one of those books that will be read and talked about 50 years from now when, hopefully, the Palestinians and Israelis will both have their own peaceful homeland.	2005-05-31
US	52960264	R2ZPMEMBBVKQOR	193072229X	552373919	MoveOn's 50 Ways to Love Your Country: How to Find Your Political Voice and Become a Catalyst for Change	Books	2	16	26	N	N	Not as effective or as "liberal" as one might think . . .	I've worked as the director of a political nonprofit and had to deal with the tactics of MoveOn.  Here's basically what they do:  They decide to have an action (e.g. lobbying Congress), they send out a bunch of emails, people register on their site, and then a dozen or so show up at a Congressional office.  Almost no input from local activist leaders and no communication with like minded nonprofits.  Total top-down approach.<br /><br />MoveOn started as an organization supporting Clinton when he was being attacked by Republicans.  Now they've taken the mantle as an \\"anti-war\\" group now that Bush is in office.  Nowhere close to truth in advertising.  If they were anti-war they would have opposed many of Clinton's foreign policies - especially his Iraq policy.  But they didn't do that.  They were Democratic Party patsies.<br /><br />So here we have this book.  As someone who has worked professionally as an activist organizer, I'm not impressed.  Some of the ideas are actually just wrong!  For example, emailing any political office is a waste of time.  Period.  It is naive to suggest that it makes a difference.  Online petitions are also typically inadequate.  Paper ones are good, but only if utilized properly and the media is let in on the project.  A lot of the other ideas are ho-hum.<br /><br />What's amazing is how much they missed - not a single mention of bird-dogging politicians when they campaign.  Astounding.  Explain that to Mr. John Strange who challeged Sec. of State Albright at a town hall meeting and ripped her arguments to shreads which helped result in preventing a bombing of Iraq!  There are other forms of bird-dogging - street theater, for example.<br /><br />Another thing missing in the book is the issue of working with libertarians and conservatives who agree with progressives on certain issues.  The peace movement, for example, _should_ be able to find allies from these quarters if they actually tried. But then . . . MoveOn isn't going to advoate for this.  Why?  Because they aren't issue activists - they're political party activists.  If you're looking to advance the Democratic Party maybe that's fine.  If you want to work towards actually changing BOTH parties you will probably want to look elsewhere for ideas.<br /><br />Sadly, as negs to this review show, the left, just like the right, can't handle criticism no matter how factual.  &lt;Sigh.>  There are days I wish groups like MoveOn and the Heritage Foundation (or any other right wing group) would just all jump off a cliff and leave us all alone.	2005-02-15

Like many people, I read \\"Was\\" immediately after \\"Wicked.\\"<br /><br />Both books cover the same topic (\\"The Wizard of Oz\\") but they have different approaches, different agendas, different topics entirely.  They're both excellent and really shouldn't be compared.<br /><br />Whereas \\"Wicked\\" gives us a non-traditional view of what's _inside_ Oz, \\"Was\\" takes us into the more disturbing realms of reality.  We see Dorothy as a human placed in horrible circumstances.  We get a glimpse behind the curtain to see the suffering of \\"Judy Garland.\\"  And then Ryman brings it all together with a modern day scarecrow dying of AIDS.<br /><br />\\"Wicked\\" was a fantastic metaphor.  It made you think.  It gave us imagery to wonder at and ponder.  \\"Was\\" strips most of that away and attempts to give us a possible story behind the metaphor.  As in, if Dorothy was a real person what would she be like?<br /><br />\\"Was\\" is not light reading.  It's not intended to be.  If you like your fiction to stay out of the shadowy corners of human existence you should avoid this book completely.  If, however, you'd like to see a dark vision of reality about Oz give \\"Was\\" a try.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that this book gets slammed for what it clearly was never intended to be - like \\"Wicked.\\"  Both books are great.  But they have different fish to fry.<br /><br />I only give the book four stars because Ryman could have have done a better job in his characterization.  Still, it's a very good book and will be one of the rare fiction titles that I plan to keep on my shelf indefinitely.	2005-01-24

I had hoped that \\"Blink\\" would offer further insight.  On some levels it does - Gladwell's theory seems to be accurate.  Despite being an excellent writer, however, he harms his thesis by using poor examples.<br /><br />The general idea behind \\"Blink\\" is how to make better snap judgments by examining those who are successful at making such quick judgments and those who have made blunders in various circumstances (whether they be expert or not).<br /><br />On the issue of having excess knowledge Gladwell uses the example of the US military practicing for Gulf War II against an \\"unnamed Middle Eastern leader.\\"  (It's obvious the person they had in mind was Saddam Hussein.) He repeatedly refers to this leader as having \\"strong religious support.\\"  Illustrating Gladwell's unfamiliarity with the topic he fails to mention in his analysis of the military that Saddam was a _secular_ leader and was viewed as evil by Islamic fundamentalists.  In other words, one of the key elements of the _premise_ created by the military (which Gladwell does not question) is obviously false.<br /><br />Gladwell insinuates that the US military has had trouble in Iraq because it concentrated on having too much intelligence and can't filter out what is important.  While they may or may not be true as a contributing negative factor, it is an argument that shows a lack of political knowledge.  There is clear evidence, as stated by the former head of the National Security Agency and Counter Intelligence at the CIA, that the Bush administration pushed for analysis that would reflect their goals.  These obvious political motivations don't even enter into Gladwell's analysis.  But then, that would destroy this example as a metaphor for his overall (legitimate) thesis.<br /><br />This failure to question the premise for one's actions shows up in one of his most central examples - the NYPD shooting of an unarmed black man who was reaching for his wallet.  Gladwell isolates the incident to a few seconds.  This fits his theory.  He never addresses the general NYC environment in which many New Yorkers felt they were under assault by the police. This environment, combined with an obvious focus on racial minorities, helped create the shooting.  Obviously, the police didn't intend to kill an innocent man. But their actions took place within a larger context - and Gladwell ignores it completely.<br /><br />The most glaring flaw in Gladwell's examples is his insistence on using issues of personal taste as proof that someone is somehow an \\"expert\\" or \\"knows more than others.\\"<br /><br />For example, Gladwell repeatedly talks about the singer Kenna and how he was shafted by the music industry because flawed surveys showed that the public wouldn't like his work.  I listened to several Kenna songs after reading this book.  I don't like Kenna!  But this doesn't make me right and Gladwell wrong.  It just means we have different tastes.  It comes off as nothing less than arrogance on the part of Gladwell to argue that experts inherently know more when it comes to something as personal as musical preferences which are so obviously linked to culture, family upbringing, etc.<br /><br />Despite these huge criticisms, I think Gladwell's theory is correct.  We can make quicker judgments if we're able to filter out all the excess garbage.  This works when we're dealing with a B&W outcome.  For example, is this art real or fake?  Does this medical procedure help or harm patients?  Does this police procedure benefit the commuhity? These are all examples used in the book.  They work.  It's just a shame that Gladwell had to muddy up the water with all these other inappropriate examples.	2005-01-20

However, there are glaring ommissions from this book that are quite damming.<br /><br />Holmes quotes Col. S.L.A. Marshall at length throughout the book. And yet, despite this pattern, not once (that I could find anyway) did Holmes mention the massive WW II Marshall study which concluded that the *majority* of US combat troops did not fire in the heat of combat.<br /><br />Marshall showed how many soldiers, in the heat of combat, exhibit \\"posturing\\" which is identical to behavior exhibited throughout the animal world. The idea is to look and sound aggressive without actually attacking to kill.  In combat this might mean shooting wildly in various directions, shooting over the enemy's heads, etc.  To the casual eye (e.g. watching archival combat footage) this looks like true combat, but it's not.  Marshall discovered this behavior through interviews with countless US soldiers who admitted (with much guilt) what they had done.<br /><br />The result of that study was the overhaul of basic training and boot camp so that soldiers not only experienced the sights and sounds of combat, but that they also simulate killing as much as possible - which in turn has resulted in a huge majority of US soldiers (since Vietnam) actually shooting to kill.<br /><br />Essentially, the Marshall study negates much of Holme's central thesis that warfare is \\"natural\\" for men and that most men seek it out willingly.<br /><br />Holmes also gives lip service to women and combat and uses convenient examples to discredit. For example, many people use Israel as an example of a sexually intregated force. This is despite the fact, as Holmes points out, that women really don't handle weapons much in the Israeli military. However, there is at least one force that Holmes failed to mention -- the Viet Cong which consisted of over 75 percent women! Because he doesn't mention that example, he can easily sweep the issue ofsex under the rug. The truth of the matter is, in war environments where one side views itself as attempting to liberate itself women usually play an integral role, including combat. This was seen throughout the 20th century.<br /><br />Holmes' sociological ignorance is never more obvious than when he discusses the sexuality of soldiers versus those who oppose war. Soldiers biologically want sex with women more! Holmes issues this proclamation without the slightest effort to back it up or to explore other options. In Holmes' world all soldiers are heterosexual and want lots of sex. This would certainly be surprising to the many great homosexual military leaders in warfare history. And I think quite a few \\"peaceniks\\" from the 60's might have some contrary evidence to offer Holmes as well.<br /><br />Holmes is a historian with a military background. He is not a sociologist and he lacks the experience, training and understanding to explore deeper issues and to look at contradictions to his beliefs.<br /><br />I give this book two stars just because this is important field to look at. Hopefully someone with better understanding of the use of propaganda (from all sides), gender roles, sexism, cultural history (that isn't Anglo Saxon!) will come along and do this topic justice.	2005-01-14

The \\"Dogs of Babel\\" starts off like Marc Levy's \\"If Only It Were True,\\" a story about a man who is the only one capable of communicating with a woman in a coma.  This is both a compliment and a criticism.  Levy's book is a very quick good read, kind of fluffy but also entertaining, and will never be called \\"literature.\\"  Still, Levy's book, with all of its silliness, has stuck with me.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Dogs\\" is that it starts off totally plot driven.  The central character, a man whose wife has just died falling out of a tree, feels almost flat in his personality.  He doesn't even really express grief about what has happened.  So you read this and you think you're reading genre fiction.  Fast and light with an emotional payoff at the end.<br /><br />Then about two thirds of the way through the book the author goes literary.  What's the point?  I read the book several months ago and I've already forgotten!  I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (which also deals with death and healing) by Alice Sebold immediately after \\"Babel\\" and it was a far better read and far more meaningful both in terms of genre and literary merit.<br /><br />I understand that \\"Babel\\" has its fans, especially those interested in characters dealing with death and depression.  I can see the book's value in addressing some of those issues.  Still, it's unlikely it will stand the test of time - as either literature or genre fiction.	2005-01-08
US	52960264	R1TSWZAPCPTAC1	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A great novel clouded by the author's personal experience	Sebold knows how to get a reader's attention with the second sentence of her novel being: \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" So many authors fail to grab you even in the first two chapters let alone the first two sentences.<br /><br />Many reviewers have indicated that they found this novel to be sad or unsatisfying because of how Susie's murder is handled. I found neither to be the case. By making the dead girl the omniscient narrator we're soothed by the fact that she lives on and cares for her family even though they are unable to see her.<br /><br />Despite the magical qualities of heaven, Sebold is able to keep the book realistic by how she handles the murder. Sometimes things aren't as neat and tidy as we'd like. And sometimes we just have to get over it and move on. What happens to Susie's murderer and how the family deals with their lack of knowledge was one of the things that kept it from being a boilerplate genre fluff piece. In the real world you don't get absolute justice and absolute resolution.<br /><br /> While I enjoyed \\"Bones\\" immensely, especially on Sebold's combination of fantasy and emotional realism, I had a problem with her perspective on crime in general.<br /><br />In her memior \\"Lucky\\" she writes of being raped in a way similar to how Susie is attacked. It doesn't seem to be a great leap to suggest that she borrowed from her own life to write this novel. This is certainly not a bad thing. However, it seems that her experience has clouded her perspective.<br /><br />Throughout the novel Ruth is able to see where girls and women have been raped and killed. At no time is she aware of crimes against males. Only women. I didn't count, but it seemed that references to crimes against women - and only women - was contained in at least half a dozen passages, perhaps even more.<br /><br />If this were a novel without fantasy this might be excused because Sebold could simply present us with a character, for example, who works ata women's shelter and meets victims on a daily basis. But the fantastic abilities of the characters in this book, Susie and Ruth specifically, open up the whole world. It makes no sense to have person with the ability see people's deaths after they've occurred to filter out images according to the victim's sex. But that's exactly what Sebold does do.<br /><br />Sebold's blind spot, conceivably created by her own horrific experience, doesn't break the novel. But for me it certainly tainted its positive message. As a pro-feminist male I found it annoying, as if the author had an ax to grind, to read passages that seemed like they were written by a young and naive college student who can't distinguish between her facts. It's obvious that females constitute the vast majority of rape victims. (It's hard to know the exact figures when males, typically raped as children, hide their experiences.) However, general male on male violence is by far more prevalent than male on female. So there needs to be balance. All Sebold had to do was have Ruth's character able to see all crime victims.<br /><br />Because of this blind spot, I can't give the book five stars.	2004-12-21

Quite simply, this is the book to read to begin your research on how the US policy towards Iraq has brought about so much conflict, strife and confusion.<br /><br />As offered with plain and clear irrefutable evidence, including copies of actual government memos, this book shows how many US politicians (many of them Republicans in the current Bush administration!) assisted Saddam up until his invasion of Kuwait in 1990.<br /><br />This was no mere minor fling.  The US government was in bed with Saddam and the Ba'ath Party since the very beginning when they (the party) overthrew the nationalist government with assistance of the CIA.  At the time our government provided hit lists to the Ba'athists.  One of the hit-men who received those lists was none other than Saddam Hussein.  And it off it went . . .<br /><br />After this book I highly recommend Said Aburish's \\"Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge\\" which exposes further Saddam's brutalities and the complicity of the US government and how they helped him rise to power and stay there.<br /><br />From there readers should check out \\"George Bush's War\\" by Jean Edward Smith which shows, again with factual concrete evidence, how the US once again coddled Saddam right up until 24 hours after the invasion of Kuwait and then did a massive switcheroo and altered US foreign policy by _finally_ opposing Saddam and his brutal regime.<br /><br />Add it all up, beginning with this book, and you have a much clearer picture as to why many people across the globe, especially Arabs and Muslims, are skeptical of US motivations in Iraq today.	2004-11-09

While it has been reasonably argued that some of the men quoted here were lying, it is important to emphasize that MOST participants were not.  Furthermore, the statements made by participants of the Winter Soldiers Investigation can be easily confirmed or backed up by other sources.<br /><br />Two of the most noteworthy biographies I can think of are \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" and \\"Casualties of War.\\"  Both men (Ron Kovic and \\"Sven Erikson\\" - not his real name. He had to change it because of death threats from other soldiers) experienced, firsthand, atrocities committed in Vietnam.  Erikson, in particular, is a metaphor for many who have spoken out.  After going public with the story of how his fellow squad members had raped and murdered an unarmed village girl his life was threatened.  Now today we have the so-called \\"Swift Boat Vets\\" who call John Kerry a liar for quoting those in this book.  The true liars are the Swift Boat Vets.<br /><br />If you have the chance to come across this book be forewarned.  It is graphic and disturbing.  But it is worth it.

The characters are, for the most part, likeable, the author effectively deals with time travel paradoxes, and the plot is a page turner.<br /><br />For a genre piece this book is a four star effort.  For general quality, it's a three.<br /><br />First off, the primary villain is not really believable.  The character is so inherently evil and cruel that it's not believable that they are motivated by the events in the book.  Because this is genre fiction the author sped the plot along and glossed over these details.  In a better book we would have known and understood more about what led to the villain's mindset.<br /><br />The book also suffers from far too many characters who are almost undistinguishable from each other.  True, any book about a high school reunion is likely to include many people.  But here we just get surface descriptions. Obviously, the author would have slowed the plot down with this information.<br /><br />One reviewer on the cover refers to this book as something Rod Serling would love.  When you read the last paragraph you'll understand the remark.  It's a good ending (can't say that about many books!) and it fits the tone of the story.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\" is a highly enjoyable read that will likely be quickly forgotten.  If you're looking for a more memorable time travel novel I'd recommend \\"Replay\\" by Ken Grimwood.	2004-09-28

So we know he supports some wars.  And we get a small initial idea of his frame of mind.  After that, however, the reader is left to wonder what the overall point is.  The author briefly states what appears to be general truths (e.g. civilians are harmed in war) and then goes on to almost exclusively use the conflict in the former Yugoslavia to back up his point.  He then repeatedly goes on rants of various lengths that, on paper, look like sermons.<br /><br />I'm the choir.  Mr. Hedges doesn't need to convince me that we need to be more selective about when we go to war.  But he does need to convince others.  I believe he fails miserably at this.  He might have been more successful had he attempted to create a general framework that was less diatribe and more sociological observation.<br /><br />In one early portion of the book Hedges refers to the theory of \\"otherness\\" as an explanation as to why it is so easy for so many to kill others.  Anyone we see as different than us due to race, gender, physical ability, national identity, appearance, etc. we can duhumanize.  They are \\"other\\" and therefore \\"not human.\\"  He states that it's possible that this is perhaps the root cause of war.  And then . . . nothing.  He leaves in the dust what is likely the framework for his entire thesis.<br /><br />What Hedges could have done was dissect the various societal phenomena that leads to otherness.  He could have taken nationalism, for example, showed various conflicts in which it was used, and then applied the principle across the board to all wars - not just the former Yugoslavia.<br /><br />I have to wonder if this book was rushed to the publisher before it was ready.  The coverillustration clearly shows a group of Americans after 9-11.  At first glance you get the idea that the book is about how war gives us meaning with the US as an example.  But that's not what we get.  What we get are rants and multiple experiences related to a conflict that most Americans don't even care about.  And that's a true shame.  The timing of this book is perfect.  We need reflection more now more than ever.  But Hedges makes the mistake of offering us examples that have very little relation to what Americans think and experience about war.<br /><br />When you talk about nationalism and show how it was used for the purposes of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in another country there is a disconnect.  A reader might think, \\"That's not what we do so this has nothing to do with my country.\\"  Hedges' vision is too narrow, too confined to one conflict.  If he had created a framework and expanded it to cover various wars he would have had something that almost any reader could apply to their own country.  Because, quite bluntly, nationalism _does_ play a role in war.  In every war.  It most definitely has played a negative role after 9-11.  From looking at the book's cover it's fair to expect you might get that from the text.  But you don't.  Hedges' work is, unfortunately, a squandered opportunity.	2004-09-14

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	4	9	10	N	N	The more you know blackjack . . . the less you'll like?	I'm not a blackjack player, but I do enjoy a good book.  \\"Bringing Down the House\\" is a fast exciting read.  But as I read I wanted to know more.  Was the author being honest?  After reading more than a hundred reviews I gained a new perspective in terms of the author, the subject, and the book critics.<br /><br />Readers who don't play the game, if they excuse some of the author's errors, will enjoy this book.  It read likes fiction.  If you take it at that level, with the understanding that some of what you're reading is true, you'll probably enjoy it immensely.  You'll have to ignore some of the author's mistakes.  For example, when he writes that Kevin's cheerleader girlfriend is touring with the Rams in the _spring_ it's pretty obvious that something is very wrong.  Was the author misled?  Maybe Kevin, the central character, was dating a cheerleader for the professional Arena Football League and wanted to spruce up his story by making her an NFL cheerleader?  Hard to say.  But it causes credibility problems given how glaring this mistake is.<br /><br />The second issue here is the depiction of playing blackjack.  In the last chapter \\"Kevin\\" acknowledges that there will be periods of time where one loses and that it takes a huge bankroll to carry you through to the other side.  That really isn't depicted in the book.  One gets the impression that these MIT kids swooped in and kicked butt on every pass.  The truth of matter is likely somewhat less glamorous.  They probably won a lot and lost a lot, but came out ahead in the end.<br /><br />Another issue critics have raised is that anyone can count cards and one doesn't have to graduate from MIT to do it.  Given the final chapter that seems to make sense.  The author is guilty of some hype by stressing the MIT angle (let alone the fact that the title is extremely misleading).  And \\"Kevin\\" is certainly guilty of embellishing his story and stressing parlor tricks (cutting the deck and playing so that a specific cardis either given to the dealer or the player) over logical play.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of the math presented in the book.  It's never clear just how much these people won.  Some point to \\"Kevin's\\" claim at the end of the book that they never got less than a 30 percent return each year on behalf of their investors.  Some charge that this proves there winnings were unimpressive.  However, if Kevin's statement is taken along with the author's, then they did quite well.<br /><br />So do the math.  The author states quite clearly that investors got 12 percent of the take.  Say you have a total investment of 1 million dollars.  The investors get 300,000.  Now do the equation:  .12x = 300,000.  With x equalling total profit you get the total sum of 2.5 million dollars.  That comes out to a 150% profit - not 30%!  For every million they brought into the situation they took out an additional 1.5 million - each year.  If (and it's a big if) this is true that makes for a fairly good profit margin.<br /><br />There seems to be two schools of thought regarding this book and its effect.  There are those who think that the author gave away key secrets and has jeopardized card counting for all blackjack players.  Then there are those who say the casinos love this book and would be happy to hand out copies to gamblers because it gives the impression that they can easily beat the house - which means more money for them.  The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.  To succeed at this, at least on the scale presented in the book, you likely need a large enough bankroll to absorb expected losses (which aren't really depicted in the book) and the ability to play intelligently and patiently.  Chances are, the average gambler cannot do this.  So perhaps its a little bit of both.  The casinos like the false hype and are scared at the same time that someone will come along who can actually walk the walk.<br /><br />Last Word: Enjoy the fast read, but don't get caught up in thehype.	2004-08-12

Reader's just have to beware that this is the _author's_ stylebook.<br />You'll find the usual suspects here with clear explanations about how to handle them.  Punctuation, grammar and spelling are all covered, from the use of commas to the proper spelling of some famous individuals.  The latter is one example of how different this book is.  Knowing the proper spelling of Nicolas Cage's name might be entertaining and useful to those working for a newspaper, but I'm not sure it makes for a better reference book.<br />Some of the \\"rules\\" presented here will invariably be treated arbitrarily by the public.  Some rules we follow, others just don't sound correct when we speak them so we move on.  And sometimes what we think we know is not true at all.<br />Three examples:<br />Walsh makes the grammatically correct point that sports teams (or rock bands) with singular names (e.g. The Who, The Orlando Magic, etc.) must be combined with singular verbs.  He argues that this is subject-verb agreement.  While that is true, people simply don't think this way.  The Magic are a team full of individuals.  (See, I just made the \\"mistake\\" in the previous sentence! I did it without thought.)  People don't think of the Magic as a he.  They think of the Magic as a them.  Just like the Yankees.  Walsh dismisses these concerns, but he's ultimately spitting into the wind.  People don't talk or think in this manner, subject-verb agreement or no.  Fifty years from now someone writing about grammar will lament the fact that no one follows this rule.  Get over it.<br />While Walsh is annoyed by this example, he also states that the current oral tradition of using plural (they, them) instead of singular pronouns (he, she) might trump the grammatical rule.  And he's OK with that.  I happen to agree with him, but it only weakens his earlier point.  If the oral tradition creates the rule in this case then why doesn't it in another?<br />Then there's at least one example where Walsh is just clearly wrong and, ironically, injects his own political views while accusing others of doing the same.  Under the term gender Walsh claims that it came about as a result of the word \\"sex\\" being viewed as specific to the sexual act.  He gives the example \\"race and sex preferences\\" and then says that _he_ thinks \\"sexual preferences\\" when he hears this term.  Funny, I never thought of that until I read his words!  But that's not the most important point.<br />Walsh criticizes those who would \\"politicize\\" the word gender by making it refer to behavior.  His example goes something like this: Johnny likes to wear dresses so he's of the female gender.  The problem is that the word gender came from the fields of sociology and psychology long before it was in common use today.  The very roots of this word are _specific_ to behavior.  There are no politics about it.  In 1990 when you said the word gender you were talking about behavior, no genitalia.  Walsh, who apparently didn't speak with a sociologiy or psychology professor before writing this, makes it appear as if the original meaning is the new \\"political\\" definition while at the same time injecting his own current political view - one that rejects the the need for a term which recognizes varying degrees of gendered behavior among the sexes.<br />Despite these criticisms, I still recommend this book.  It's interesting and educational.  Just beware of the fact that this is a stylebook and, by definition, expresses the author's viewpoint.	2004-07-14
US	52960264	R12IZDQS77L24M	0767905385	262010179	Catch Me If You Can: The True Story of a Real Fake	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Reads like a well made novel, but the ending has no meaning	&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a fun and enjoyable read and is easily as good as many current novels.  If you like the movie the book will be even more interesting because it goes into detail about Abagnale's exploits.  In fact, in many ways the book is actually more interesting than the movie.<br />For example, many movie viewers couldn't figure out how Abagnale escaped an airplane via the bathroom toilet.  This actually happened and is described in the book.  Abagnale also describes in far more detail the extent to which he researched how to look and act like a real airline pilot.  It's mind boggling how much effort he was willing to put into it.<br />Despite how fun it is to read, &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot; has one huge glaring flaw: the ending.<br />We know that Abagnale has worked with the banking industry for many years now in helping them improve their security.  What we don't really know, at least from him directly, is how he went from being a swindler to being a high paid consultant.  On a psychological level this is the meat of the story.  OK, he had a ball being a fake pilot, doctor and lawyer.  But what did he learn?  Anything?  This is where the book falls into the definition of fluff.  Because we have no meaning, no explanation, all we're left with are outrageous exploits and escapades.<br />All of this begs the question: Did Abagnale actually learn anything?  Or is all of this just a further continuation of the con he started as a kid?  I don't know either way.  It's too bad because Abagnale likely has a few things to teach us - especially at-risk youth who tend to think they're invincible.  Unfortunately, the message Abagnale seems to be giving us is that you CAN get away with it.  While that's certainly true (just look at ENRON!), it doesn't help that the author shows so little remorse or an explanation of how he changed.	2004-07-06

While I understand its worth as a cookbook, I have to object to how this book is marketed as being able to change one's lifestyle.<br />Recently diagnosed with heart disease in my mid-thirties, I have been looking for information that will both improve my health and work within the limits of my lifestyle.  This book, at least for me, will not and cannot work.  But I recognize it will for others.<br />First of all, as the author indicates, this type of cooking requires time and preparation.  This is, after all, a part of Meterranean culture.  I understand that.  But it is not part of American culture.  More importantly, it's not even feasible for many people trying to scrape by financially.  The idea of working in the kitchen for hours each day is simply not possible for many Americans - regardless of their own desires.  This is why I suspect that the audience for this type of book is restricted almost exclusively to families and individuals who are wealthy (or at least not in financial debt) or who are in a traditional relationship in which one spouse stays home during the day.<br />Another thing that I found annoying was the author's attitude that one's sweet tooth should be easily satisfied with a basic cookie or a piece of fruit.  Having been raised a vegetarian throughout most of my childhood I can attest to the fact that eating natural foods all the time does _not_ guarantee that your desires for cake, ice cream or brownies will simply disappear.  For some people, perhaps even a majority, it is a question of just giving up what they desire.  If there's one thing I've grown to detest after my own diagnosis is that I will be easily satisified with my new diet and lifestyle.  Like many individuals with heart disease, I must accept my plight.  However, I don't have to put up with anyone telling me that I will be satisfied with something that I already know from my own experience to be a poor substitute.  In other words, don't manipulate me, just state the truth outright: you may like desserts, but you're going to have to give them up.<br />If you have the time and interest to cook this book is an excellent choice.  If your lifestyle simply cannot adapt then I would recommend looking elsewhere.  In my personal experience I found &quot;SuperFoods Rx : Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life&quot; by Steven G. Pratt to be the most helpful thus far.	2004-07-05

Getting the &quot;truth&quot; here, however, is very unlikely.<br />The draft riot was of specific interest to me as someone who's researched and written about protest (violent and non-violent), political events, the military, etc.  Unfortunately, it's quite obvious that Asbury wasn't interested in doing a history or sociology textbook when he put this together more 70 years ago.  For example, the police are referred to as &quot;heroic&quot; and &quot;valiant&quot; while the rioters are depicted as monsters and animals.  None of this helps explain why these events occurred.  Instead, Asbury takes sides - which severely limits the book's worth if you're wanting to learn more about this forgotten piece of US history.  It's certainly not a serious study of what caused the riot and the various brutalities committed by _all sides_.  It's hard to believe that this book is the source material for the movie.<br />If you're seriously wanting to learn about the gangs, riots and turmoil in NYC during this era - the true story by behind the movie - then you'll want to look elsewhere.  If you're interested in seeing some of the propaganda that was created regarding these events, some of the yellow journalism and tabloid style writing that existed in the 1920s and 30s when this text was written, then you might get something out of this book.  On that merit alone - as flawed journalism - perhaps this book is worth a read.	2004-06-29

At first it reminded me somewhat of Gregory Maguire's better novels.  Of course, Lee tends to write far darker fiction than Maguire.  But both have put their personal spin on fairy tales to create, in many cases, a more interesting story.<br />While \\"White As Snow\\" is definitely interesting, it is full of unbelievable characters who tend to fit into only four types: Passive females (Arpazia and Coira), cruel and inhumane males (Draco, Hadz and others), window dressing (old crones, maids, dwarves, etc.) and two unbelievably saintly males who don't exist in the real world (Klymeno and Hephaestion).<br />Both Queen Arpazia and Coira (Snow White) are victims which seems to cause their passivity.  On a pyschological level I see what Lee was doing.  Their behavior is not that uncommon amongst survivors of abuse.  It does not, however, make interesting fiction to read about two women who are so utterly passive or void of personal motive except for, perhaps, jealousy (Arpazia).<br />The strongest characters in the book, the evil men, are easily the most rounded.  Lee got that part right.<br />The window dressing characters, for the most part, belong in any story.  It's just that here there are so many â\\" far too many in fact.  Arpazia is helped by the woods people - why?  What is their motivation?  Because the plot demands it?  Coira's nurse maids and servants are flat as a pancake.  One maid, Ulvit, goes out her way to help Coira as she matures and grows.  We never find out why.  In the end Coira distrusts Ulvit, the one who helped her the most, and she is discarded on the heap of multiple other \\"unimportant\\" characters.<br />The two positive male characters in the book - Arpazia's Klymeno and Coira's Hephaestion - are characters straight out of a romance novel.  When Klymeno first meets Arpazia he sexually pleases her over and over and never receives pleasure in return.  When she seeks him out a second time he literally asks permission to pleasure himself.  He is so utterly \\"perfect\\" that he never protests when she aborts his child.  Hephaestion, although more filled out and therefore less saintly, suffers the same result.  Even though he _wants_ to be a father he tells Coira, before stating his desires, that she is obviously free to abort her child if that is her wish.  It seems obvious that Lee is pro-choice.  I don't have a problem with that.  What angered me was that Lee seemed so intent on insisting that abortion was so completely a woman's choice that any thoughts or feelings from a man are utterly unimportant.  Doesn't a man have a right to say, \\"I would like to be a father to this child . . . but the choice is ultimately yours?\\"  Lee wouldn't let these two men even this small amount of personal desire.<br />The issue of abortion is certainly not the focus of the story.  However, it is a symptom of Lee's weakness in this novel overall.  Far too often characters and developments within the story are there because the plot demands it or it appears to be Lee's own personal personal view.  The characters themselves seemed to have been squelched by Lee, as if she possibly didn't want to hear what they had to say.	2004-06-22

I had never heard of his book until then and I immediately wrote down the title so that I could buy it at a later date.<br />Now that I've read the book I'm trying to figure out why what I heard him say is so different than what I'm reading.<br />My problem with this book started right at the beginning with his &quot;trademarked&quot; Gremlin-Training Method (all caps, just as he does in the book).  This seemed contrived to me, absolutely false.  It was like reading a book talk about the author's patented passive solar windows as their own trademarked &quot;Sun Energy Capture Device.&quot;  In other words, like an infomercial.  This intial reaction was confirmed as I continued to read.  The tactics and topics Carson raises are extremely simplistic.  Practical perhaps, but hardly worthy of a &quot;trademark.&quot;<br />The other problem I had with the book is that Carson uses his metaphor to excess.  This is a danger he should have been aware of.  A Gremlin is a workable metaphor for most people as long as you make it abstract.  That is, that voice in your head which puts you down.  As soon as you start describing its supposed physical nature (the minister, the coach, the monster, etc.) the metaphor starts losing its audience.  Not everyone wants or needs to describe that nasty voice in such terms.<br />I wished Carson had backed off the metaphor somewhat, backed off from from the hard sell on his &quot;trademarked&quot; method, and just gave an in-depth analysis of people's internal negative voices, where they come from, how to control them, etc.  I don't want to read something that makes me feel like I'm buying a used car or the next TV control clapper.<br />This book, based on many previous glowing reviews, works for many people.  No doubt that is true.  Criticizing this book is rather subjective - if it works for you, it works, if it doesn't, it doesn't.  You can't debate it.  Myrecommendation is to really look at the text before buying and THEN decide if you want to purchase.  You might find that you like it, or you might not.	2004-06-09

I personally dislike the theme versions.  They just feel like I'm being forced to think like the editors.<br />In the world of dictionary form thesauri the Chambers stands out above the rest.<br />It is far and away the easiest on the eyes.  Using black text offset with light blue the book allows you to focus on different aspects of the text.  The light blue text indicates the form of speech such as verb, adjective, etc.  There's also good white space so that the black text stands out.  The entries themselves are interspersed with valuable nuggets of information.  Look up the word &quot;government&quot; and you not only get a list of synonyms, but also a list of the various forms of government such as monarchy, plutocracy, democracy, etc.  On the same page you'll see entries for the words &quot;gourmet&quot; and &quot;gourmand&quot; along with a separate boxed entry explaining how each is different.  These are all very nice touches.  The Chambers Compact is also thorough with over 350,000 synonyms.<br />Combine all of this with a reasonable price and one has to wonder why it's not more popular.  Is it because it offers both British and American words?  Perhaps.  But anyone who uses a thesaurus frequently enough will want one that's easy on the eyes.  I've seen nothing that compares with the Chambers version - not even Oxford.  And certainly not from Webster's.<br />I've found that it's difficult to view a copy of the Chamber's Compact before you purchase.  If you want to get a small taste of the what the text looks like visit the Chambers main web site.	2004-06-04
US	52960264	R1CIYK8X9EY2OC	068816112X	761772754	Replay	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Excellent - far better than The Time Traveler's Wife	When I first started this book the author describes in detail how the central character, Jeff, first returns back in time to his life in college.  There are Playboy magazines on his shelves and the guy has a girlfriend - what sleazeball has Playboys when he's in a relationship?  And it seemed like there was a level of denseness in the character's thinking in how long it took him to realize that he \\"wasn't in Kansas\\" any longer  Maybe this is a mandatory scene in every time travel novel - the central characters have to go through this charade of disbelief.<br />Once I got past these scenes, however, \\"Replay\\" took off.  In fact, after reading this immediately after \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" I was astonished by how much better this book was.  Far more engrossing and just more believable.<br />The characters are believable.  They're not blinded by their \\"love.\\" They sometimes make bad choices, but those choices are usually made with some common sense - not because the plot demanded it.<br />The elements outside the characters who are living their lives over and over are absolutely believable.  In one story the US government gets involved and basically imprisons the two characters because of their ability to \\"predict the future\\" so accurately.  And then the book shows how the world spins out of control when the government misuses this information.  Realistic.  Definitely.<br />Another realistic approach is how the author recognizes the fact that most people have loved more than one person in their lifetime.  The two central characters, for example, love each other, but yet they also love (romantically) others who have entered their life.  There is no contradiction.  It's just reality.  Most people have also had more than one relationship.  It's as if the author took someone's life and expanded it by 150 years and then allowed that person to fully explore the weaknesses and strengths of each relationship.<br />The author doesn't try to create silly rules as was the casewith \\"Time Traveler's Wife.\\"  The characters can change things . . . or not.  It's their choice.  As for paradoxes, etc. they're glossed over, but handled well enough.  The author has bigger fish to fry.<br />The book has a point.  Some have argued that it is trite.  I disagree.  Live your life to the fullest, enjoy the moments, take advantage of what you have - you only get it once.  Sometimes the truest statements are the shortest statements one can make.  To expect the meaning of life from the author is a bit much.  The author (now apparently deceased) was not some god.  He didn't write the Bible or the Koran.  He wrote a very good time travel novel with a simple but eloquent point that just makes sense.	2004-05-28

It's kind of like saying, \\"I don't like chocolate ice cream,\\" and then expecting this opinion to be the reality for everyone else.<br />As a male, I happened to like \\"The Girls' Guide.\\"  My girlfriend, on the other hand, did not.  \\"Chick lit\\" this is not.  True, most readers are probably women, but that doesn't make it genre fiction - something that is tied to certain rules of plot instead of just good character development.<br />With the exception of the last story, the author's focus isn't on creating the mandatory happy ending.  No, Bank wants to show the whole silliness of dating and mating from a specific perspective - that of the sarcastic and funny Jane.  For the most part it works.  However, as others have pointed out, there's just a little bit too much wittiness to go around.  Too many of the characters are as smart and funny as Jane.<br />When it comes to the men Bank plays it straight.  Which is as it should be. You know you're in la-la land when an author takes sides and manipulates the story so that all the men or all the women are good or bad.  (Example: Emerald City : Stories by Jennifer Egan.)  You get a taste of both here.  It's realistic.<br />As for the last story, I happen to like it because it's so true.  The sexist \\"rules\\" that cause certain men to be attracted to women are based on faulty logic.  Do you just want to get married - to anyone?  Then the \\"rules\\" work.  If you want to meet someone you truly love, be yourself.  Simplistic, but true.  And something that a lot of readers, especially women, need to know.	2004-05-24

For a first novel Audrey Niffenegger has done a wonderful job of creating a new and interesting perspective on time travel using a love story as the foreground.<br />The first half of the book was absolutely stupendous.  Niffenegger sets up her premise and you get pulled into her world.  It was at this point that I thought I would be recommending this book to everyone and buying extra copies for my friends for Christmas.<br />And then things began to fail to add up or were just disturbing.  (Spoiler alert.)<br />Niffenegger creates certain rules (as required by most sci-fi/fantasy) for her world.  Henry, the time traveler, can't really change things, he can only really observe.  Then, when the plot requires it and Clare needs more space in their house, he wins the lottery.  This brings out several problems.  One, if he can do that, why can't he do other things? Two, if he can be rich, why can't he affect things outside of his life such as people who are destitute, charities or political causes?  And why don't these issues even come up - does he even care?  And three, the lottery is brought up and then . . . forgotten.<br />This pattern occurs again when Henry seeks medical attention.  We're drawn in as he convinces his doctor (who smokes in his office - give me a break!) to treat him and study his DNA.  And then we have to wait 100+ pages as Niffenegger follows Clare's obsession with having a baby over several years.  What's Henry's doctor doing to treat Henry?  We don't know because we're not shown.<br />Both Clare and Henry, in the latter half of the novel, are presented in a rather flawed manner.<br />Henry is confronted with his own mortality, more so than most humans.  But does he discuss it, think about it, reveal the details to his loved ones as he should do?  Not really.<br />Clare on the other hand becomes downright selfish and obsessed in the second half.  She betrays one of her best friends not just once, but twice.  There's an annoying scene where she tries to &quot;protect&quot; Alba, her daughter, from medical assistance against Henry's wishes when he so obviously knows what's best far better than she does.  And then there's the ending in which we are given nothing about Clare's life after Henry's departure.  It's as if her life was nothing without him.  She did nothing, accomplished nothing.<br />The book reminded me at the end of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily Bronte.  A compliment of sorts.  But like &quot;Heights,&quot; &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; is about an unhealthy expression of love and obsession.<br />One of the things that felt so odd about the book was it's lack of involvement with the outside world.  It seems unlikely that Henry's actions would be so ignored by the government.  Wouldn't someone catch on, start investigating, and then want in on the action?  Wouldn't Henry's friends be more persistant about getting help, especially about money?  Wouldn't both Henry and Clare be interested in helping others with Henry's knowledge?  It's as if Clare and Henry are living in their own cocoon because none of these issues are really brought up.<br />Overall, Niffenegger makes the mistake of having &quot;idiot plot&quot; devices control her story.  Why is something there? It's there because the plot demands it, not because it fits with the characters or the real story.<br />All of this is such a shame given the book's first half which just glowed with promise.  Despite all these criticisms, it's still a good read.  It's just not going to be a classic.ies to &quot;protect&quot; Alba, her daughter, from medical assistance against Henry's wishes when he so obviously knows what's best far better than she does.

US	52960264	R1DEZCDR16ZVVZ	1582340501	353981263	Saddam Hussein: The Politics of Revenge	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Required reading to understand the current situation	Now, perhaps more than when Saddam was in power, this book is required reading in understanding the current situation in Iraq.<br />As Aburish so clearly illustrates, for decades the US supported Baath Party and Saddam Hussein.  In the process they back stabbed on more than one occasion the Kurds, the Shia and other groups who opposed Saddam.  This betrayal has certainly been a contributing factor to the situation as it exists now (2004) with various insurgent groups attacking US forces.  While it's true that some of these groups are coming from external influences (e.g. Syria and Iran), it's also true that some are just people who view the US as a hostile occupying force.  Part of the distrust came from the history Aburish describes here.<br />The notion that Aburish is somehow &quot;anti-US&quot; misses the point entirely.  The US policy toward Saddam post Gulf War I was one of of &quot;positive containment.&quot;  As explained by a member of the National Security Council in 1991: &quot;Our goal [was] to remove Saddam Hussein, not his regime.&quot;  This meant that we actively prevented other groups from overthrowing the regime.  Indeed, as reported by the major media, Kurdish and Shia rebel leaders were told during a coup attempt orchestrated by the CIA that they should &quot;not get in the way of our operation.&quot;<br />How could we have dealt with Saddam?  This is perhaps a weakness of Aburish's book, but it's one created in part by a totally warped US policy.  At one point can we go back in time and stop supporting his brutal regime?  Since we can't go back in time, how can we change our actions so that they represent true American ideals?  In this manner of thinking, Aburish's analysis actually wasn't that far off.  In the long haul we might have gotten rid of Saddam by a policy that supported the Iraqi people instead of one that resigned them to victims of both their own government and the US dominiated UN policy of genocidal sanctions - a policy that ultimately strengthened Saddam domestically.<br />With Saddam now gone from power this book is perhaps a little dated.  However, it is necessary reading if you want a better understanding of the current quagmire created by the US invasion.	2004-04-29

Something you might expect from Dorling-Kindersley.<br />What happened?  This book is geared towards trivia buffs with very little practical use.  Look up Brazil and you'll get 6 or 7 sentences with no mention of the fact that they speak Portuguese instead of Spanish like the rest of South America.  Look up Aztec and the first sentence is a trivial comment about what King Montezuma II liked to eat for dinner.<br />The problem seems to be when the authors try to get too broad in their terms.  Look up microwave or photosynthesis  and you get a brief and succint explanations.  Look up broad concepts like marriage or spiders and you get rambling thoughts.<br />About the only way they could have salvaged this thing would have if they stuck to the overall almanac style.  At least then it would have had a constant theme and would have been useful as a reference book.  As it is it's mostly just trivia and nice pictures.	2004-04-23

Not so with &quot;Funerals.&quot;  Here she flexed her literary muscle.<br />&quot;Funerals&quot; is a descent into a family's dark past and, at times, even into madness.  I believe it could even be described as cathartic, especially for anyone recovering from their own childhood.  Through it all Hyde maintains a believable tone and atmosphere which is a tough path to follow.  Not too many authors can approach this topic (metaphor, family abuse, mental illness) without coming off as melodramatic or just incoherent.<br />I can't say that &quot;Funerals&quot; is for everyone.  But it is an excellent novel nonetheless.  I highly recommend it.	2004-04-15

They're not lying.<br />With more than 1800 pages, 300,000+ definitions, and a high quality construction, this is the dictionary to buy in the $25 to $40 price range.  Its nearest competitor (that I'm aware of) is the Concise Oxford Dictionary which is smaller and not nearly as well made with pages that feel as if they'll easily tear.<br />The Chambers dictionary, while useful to anyone wanting a large single volume with as many definitions as possible, is also perfect for smart college students on a budget with demanding academic loads, especially in English.  If you're giving this as a gift, you'll likely want to keep that in mind.  Someone who wants your typical Webster's \\"college dictionary\\" likely won't appreciate or need Chambers.<br />The one thing that makes Chambers stand out is its quirkiness.  Take these defintions as an example:<br />mullet: a hairstyle that is short at the front, long at the back, and ridiculous all round<br />middle-aged: between youth and old age, variously reckoned to suit the reckoner<br />&eacute;clair: a cake, long in shape but short in duration<br />These kinds of definitions will either attract or repel buyers depending on how you like your dictionaries.<br />Overall, if you need a dictionary with some muscle this is the one.  If you want a better one you'll need to start looking at multiple volume sets such as the \\"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\\" (but _not_ the Webster's 3rd International which is severely dated in its definitions).	2004-04-14

There would be moments of sheer brillance mixed in with a general soupy fog of academic lingo, rhetoric and, at times, arrogance.<br />Curtis White has a theory that makes a lot of sense.  As a former director of a political non-profit charged with the task of mobilizing grassroots Americans I saw the &quot;middle mind&quot; at work on a daily basis.  Very basic critiques of US governmental policy seemed incomprehensible to people who definitely had the intelligence to figure it all out.  But many couldn't.  Why?  I think Curtis White has something here with this book.  This is why I picked it up with such enthusiasm.<br />When you've got a great idea like White you're charged with two specific tasks.  One, present the theory.  Two, illustrate how this theory reflects reality by using specific examples.<br />It is in the examples that White gets bogged down.<br />I cheered when I read his critique of &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;  Some of his arguments were the very same thoughts I had when I first saw the movie.  The character of &quot;Upham&quot; the translator was a blatant attack on compassion,  on intellectuals, and anything or anyone who doesn't follow the American way.  Unfortunately, as White points out, very few people were able to &quot;read&quot; the movie and see these underlying messages.<br />Then White goes after college &quot;Cultural Studies&quot; programs.  When you look at the book you get the idea that this is supposed by about why _most_ Americans have a middle mind.  Concentrating on cultural studies reveals White's weak spot.  He's an academic and, like many academics, he's been in his isolated world too much.  As a lawyer once told me, &quot;Don't worry, it's all a tempest in teapot.&quot;  That describes perfectly the political turmoil on a lot of US college campuses.  This is not to say that cultural studies hasn't had an impact.  But to suggest that it deserves this much attention is just more ivory tower arrogance.<br />Another kind of mistake White makes is in picking less obvious targets like Terry Gross's &quot;Fresh Air.&quot;  Coming up with a theory can be a moment of genius.  Going after an NPR radio personality who projects a smart and extremely pleasant demeanor is simply not a good way to endear potential believers in that theory.  Even if White is correct about Gross, it's just not smart if you want people to actually believe in what you say.  You turn them off because you've insulted someone they happen to think is a nice person.<br />Overall, I think White can't see the forest through the trees.  The big picture here are the larger issues - politics, social movements, that sort of thing.  A huge percentage of Americans have seen &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;  That same huge percentage also tends to blindly support US foreign policy.  There's a loose connection there and its important.  Focusing on the micro culture of academic theory, however, has very little relation to the lives of everyday Americans.  Any effect it has had is surely minimal.<br />If White had just stuck to more commonly shared American sources of information and culture such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; this book could have had a far more reaching impact.<br />I will give White credit, however, for being fairly impartial in aiming his criticisms.  While he happens to like Zinn and Chomsky, he also attacks, for example, the New Age movement and political correctness.  This is important because the middle mind, as I witnessed in my own experience working in politics, is not exclusive to a political ideology.  Each side has certain weak spots.  On the right you've got people who follow George W. Bush without question.  On the other you've got leftists who blindly believe that Mumia Abu Jamal is as innocent as driven snow and anyone who says otherwise is a racist.  Both mentalities depict a certain amount of intellectual laziness - a middle mind.<br />Overall, White has made the revolutionary act of describing the reality we live in. Americans don't think.  How he went about doing this is a disappointing squandered opportunity.	2004-04-09

(No one who owns this book will keep it for that reason.)  In fact, this is a book that can be at times painful to open up and look at.<br />Perhaps this reaction is the result of the dual reality one is presented with - not only are the photos depicting (at times) someone being killed, but you also know that the person who took the photograph was also killed.  In one photograph you actually see the last photo taken by that journalist before he died.<br />So why own it?  &quot;Reguiem&quot; is a proverbial granite memorial to anyone who was killed in Vietnam - American, South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, whoever.  By showing photographs from all sides it is able to maintain a level of objectivity that you won't find in many books.  It just hits you with, &quot;Here, this was the reality.  Deal with it.&quot;  Because of this it also acts as a book of history and not just one about photographers and their work.<br />But still, I think &quot;Requiem&quot; will particularly appeal to anyone who's interested in photography and photojournalism.<br />I'm reminded of the book &quot;The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War&quot; which is about photographers in South Africa and the fall of Apartheid.  The photographers within that book are driven by excitment and adrenaline.  They also want their photography to make an impact, to change the world.  (A feeling many photojournalists share.)  One of the photographers in that book, a man by the name of Kevin Carter who won the Pulitzer Prize winner for his shot of a dying Sudanese child, committed suicide as result of the desperation he felt.<br />&quot;Requiem&quot; is in some ways a complement to &quot;The Bang-Bang Club&quot; because it shows the ultimate sacrifice war photographers sometimes make in their pursuit of the craft.  This makes the book that much more haunting.  While some of these photosdid alter our perspective on the world, they didn't really change it.  So was their sacrifice worth it?  You have to open the book to decide for yourself.	2004-04-09

Then she married an abusive American and received some of that same treatment here in the US.  What might have caused another person to be bitter, angry and cynical seems to have only strengthened Hayslip's resolve to live and let go.  It's clear that her Buddhism played a crucial role in allowing her to do this.  I'm not a Buddhist, but I do wonder about the followers of other faiths in their ability to follow in Hayslip's footsteps.<br />And that's ultimately what I think most readers will get out of this.  If you've had a bad day, a bad year, or even bad life - read this book.  If Le Ly Hayslip can forgive, move on, and make a positive contribution to this world then just about anyone else can as well.  She's an inspiration and a role model to all of us, no matter who you are or what country you live in.<br />Sadly, Oliver Stone butchered her two books in his movie.  The drama, chaos, and the meaning of Le Ly Hayslips actions just aren't conveyed well.  If you've seen only the movie you've missed out on the best parts of what Hayslip has to teach us.<br />I can't recommend this book (and &quot;When Heaven and Earth Changed Places&quot;) enough.  It needs to be read - by everyone.  I can't say that about too many books.	2004-04-09

Barely a sacred cow is left untouched.<br />I've owned this book for more than ten years and it never fails to catch my interest when I pick it up again.  I've also shown it to many of my friends and even given it as a gift.<br />As for this notion of &quot;anti-US,&quot; this seems a bit simplistic.  The author's intention seems pretty clear - to establish 19th century America as a pretty dangerous place to live.  There are few, if any, comparisons to Europe.  It's not intended to be a book about how &quot;bad the US is compared to country X.&quot;  No, this is about just telling it like it is (or rather, was).  Being honest about our past does us no harm.  Indeed, it allows us to be become even better in the future.  It's called learning from your mistakes.  And Bettman's book is an excellent place to start learning.	2004-04-08

As a journalist he decides to enter into that world to see how the other half lives.  What he sees and feels cannot be debated, negated, ignored or even criticized.  It just is.<br />What Yoram experienced was an everyday existance of discrimination from the Jewish Isrealies he encountered.  He wasn't brutally attacked or beaten or spit upon at every corner.  No, his story is far more subtle.  What he describes is a life of an outcast, of what it feels like to be someone who's viewed as &quot;less than,&quot; as the &quot;other.&quot;<br />The routine details of this life are in fact some of the most important in the current debate about the situation in Israel.  What Binur experiences is essentially the seed that has helped bring about the larger forms of violence with each side upping the ante.  It doesn't start with a bulldozer destroying a Palestinian home.  And it doesn't start with a Palestinian bombing a sidewalk cafe and killing a dozen innocent civilians.  It starts with everyday hatred - and that's what Binur so clearly gives us.<br />We already know that some (not all) Palestinians refuse Israel's right to exist.  What we need, as Americans who have blindly supported Israel no matter what it does, is to see how some Israelis (not all) haves refused the Palestinians a right to their homeland - and their dignity.  Binur's book is a step in the right direction in learning that lesson.	2004-04-08

It's almost perfect for both college students and for everyday use.<br />The only problem with this version is the quality of the paper which is rather thin.  I highly recommend this dictionary, but I would be hesitant to give one as a gift to someone who I know is rough with their books.  The pages feel as if they could tear quite easily.  This is likely one of the reasons that the book is so compact and easy to use.  So you have the trade off of compact size versus durability.

There are better choices.	The Webster's Third New International Dictionary is a huge and wonderful resource that has more than 400,000 definitions. It's probably the second most comprehensive behind the Oxford English Dictionary.  And it's also straight out of 1961 and a total waste of your money.<br /><br />There seems to be two major arguments about this dictionary, both of which miss the point.<br /><br />First, there's the issue of prescriptive vs. descriptive.  Most general users want a descriptive dictionary.  We all know that, for example, \\"ain't\\" is bad English.  But we also know that it's been spoken and written billions of times and thus should not be ignored simply because it offends those who speak or write properly.<br /><br />The far bigger issue here is whether or not you, the consumer, should buy THIS dictionary given that it's the same one they were publishing back in 1961.  The primary argument for using this book is that we don't need a dictionary of current English and it's helpful to have something that explains words that might not be found in newer dictionaries.  It's true that no one should need to look up \\"Internet\\" or \\"email.\\"  However, that doesn't make this dictionary any more valuable.<br /><br />The value of this edition as a tool in using older words is minimal.  You can get this edition for a few bucks at a yard sale or a \\"friends of the library sale.\\"  If you need a dictionary like this right now, there is at least one alternative that will give you more accurate definitions as well as words you might encounter in your reading, especially older English literature.  That dictionary is the Chambers 9th edition which was revised and published as recently as 2003.  It has more than 300,000 definitions and goes back all the way  to Shakespeare.  It is one of the dictionaries of choice for Scrabble users (and that's saying something!) and English majors.  While it might be a little smaller than the Webster's Third, it makes up for it in all other ways - including price.

I found this odd because it is one of the first things that comes to mind when you meet someone from another faith.  What day, if any, is THE day of worship?  For Jews and Christian Seventh Day Adventists, for example, it's sunset Friday to sunset Saturday.  Seems like this should have been mentioned.  Given that it's one of the Ten Commandments it should have been at least mentioned under both Judaism and Christianity.  (And any author wanting to tell the truth would acknowledge the fact that the Pope actually did change the official Sabbath day from Saturday to Sunday many many centuries ago.)<br />LIke every &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; this one doesn't take sides.  Or rather, what it approaches it always sounds good.  In fact, it bends over backwards to be open to all religions.<br />I've looked at the guides of Judaism, Christianity and Islam and found all to be wanting because they fail to be critical in any way.  Everything is always kept &quot;positive.&quot; And that's what you get here as well.  But still, of all the guides to be non-opinionated, I would say this would be the best choice to follow that path,<br />With that said, I would urge anyone who really wants to understand the various religions to dig deeper.  This is a good place to start, to get your feet wet, but if you stop researching you'll find yourself ill prepared to have a mature debate about religion, the Middle East or the various cultural problems we deal with today.	2004-04-04

However, I'm sure anyone looking to purchase this volume is mostly looking for a visual item anyway.  I'm also betting that many people won't even bother to read many of the captions and will just enjoy browsing through all the great photographs.<br />Dorling Kindersley, the book's publisher, has a well deserved reputation for making books so fully illustrated that they've single handedly revolutationized the publishing industry, especially for reference, travel and history books.<br />This book, at over 1000 pages and probably even more illustrations, is a huge bargain now that it's out of print.  Maybe at full retail one should balk at inadequate captions.  But at these prices, this is a steal and makes a perfect gift for almost anyone, from pre-teens to adults of all ages.	2004-04-02

In too many short stories it seems like there's no point, that the whole thing was a college course exercise in creating a single scene.  Or its the opposite extreme in which you've got all plot and no character to care about.  Hyde somehow does the miraculous and pulls both off in just about every story here.  And she does it all in a positive and life affirming way.<br />Far and away, I consider this her best work.  This is perhaps not a popular view among Catherine Ryan Hyde fans, but her later work has gotten sloppy, especially in her last two books, &quot;Electric God&quot; and &quot;Walter's Purple Heart&quot; in which she presents us with unrealistic characters and situations.  But that is simply not the case here.<br />If you've read any of Hyde's later books and you want more then I highly recommend &quot;Earthquake Weather.&quot;  You'll be pleasantly surprised that perhaps her best book ever is the one that's sadly out of print.	2004-04-01

That just seems to be a fact.  In \\"Pleasures\\" we get a sympathetic female character who's on a path of discovery about herself, her sexuality, and the world.  It's a book with a broad base of appeal among book lovers.  \\"Sparrow\\" is just a different kind of animal.<br />Hellenga seems to have a way of misdirecting his readers.  In \\"Pleasures\\" one gets the idea that the whole point is a controversial rediscovered text when in fact its just a set piece.<br />The same is true of \\"Sparrow.\\"  The jacket talks about Woody's daughter dying in a terrorist attack in Italy.  This certainly makes for an interesting story.  Or rather, it would have.  Instead, Hellenga takes us on another path as the main character, this time an older man, takes his own path of discovery.  It's likely that some don't want to take the ride, especially fans \\"Pleasures.\\"<br />Yes, this book has sex.  But then, so does \\"Pleasures.\\"  Maybe folks are just more comfortable reading about a younger woman's maturing sexuality than they are with an older man who lusts for young and older women alike.  Frankly, both books are honest and both are good (I admit \\"Pleasures\\" is by far the better read).  At the risk of offending certain readers, I think the problem is more with one's views on sex and not necessarily a failing of Hellenga.<br />In one scene Hellenga describes a situation in which he realizes that he's hurt a female colleague his own age who's emotionally distant.  Woody recognizes the lost opportunity and shows empathy, at least internally, towards the woman.  In other words, this isn't just some guy out to have sex with a student.  He's complicated and he has feelings.<br />Hellenga is a versatile author.  Unfortunately, he attracts certain readers by his apparent misdirection.  While he might be guilty of false advertising, he's certainly not guilty of being a bad writer.  If you're open to the experience, give \\"Sparrow\\" a chance.  Just be forewarned - it's not \\"The Sixteen Pleasures.\\"	2004-04-01

Larry Watson could be one of the best American writers alive today.  I say could be.  He's easily one of the most accessible authors when it comes to fiction about the western US.  And he comes up with intriguing stories that really make you want to open the book to find out what happens.<br />But Watson has a problem with characters, particularly women.  (Perhaps he should hook up with Robert Hellenga who wrote &quot;The Sixteen Pleasures&quot; to get an idea of how to present a female character.)<br />In &quot;Laura&quot; Watson depicts multiple negative female stereotypes.  In &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Orchard&quot; the females are rather bland.  Of the five Watson books I've read I'd say that &quot;Montana 1948&quot; is by far his best by a million miles.  It's short, to the point, and packs a wallop.  Perhaps that's because he focused on the pov of a young boy.  Because of the set up we give him allowances.  We don't expect a boy to know and understand the feelings and motivations of adults, especially women.  So it works.  Superbly in fact.<br />In &quot;White Crosses&quot; we have yet another intriguing story.  Why was the principal in the car with the young girl?  You open the book and you want to find out more.<br />&quot;Crosses&quot; is a good read.  And I disagree with those who say the character asides are besides the point.  Watson is not some Dean Koontz who wants us just to care about the plot.  He wants us to get into the hearts and minds of his characters.  To do that we need their thoughts and memories.<br />But still, as pointed out by a female reviewer here, Watson just can't handle those female characters.  They're either beautiful or ugly.  They're inexplicable.  They're unaccessable.  They're just not human.<br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the ending.  You'll say aloud &quot;No!&quot; when you finish the tale.  It's frustrating and tragic.  Does it work?  Yes, I think it does.  Too often we get stuck on that unrealistic merry-go-round of happy endings.  We forget reality, we forget that life is messy.  Here, Watson reminds us that things don't always work out as planned.<br />Overall, a good book that could have been great.  But I'm crossing my fingers for Larry Watson.  Someday he'll get both the story and the female characters right.  Someday he'll give us a female character with all those &quot;annoying&quot; asides with real thoughts and memories.	2004-04-01

Perhaps he's tapped into the psyche of book lovers by addressing one of our fears: Imagine your most favorite, rare books that you've collected have been damaged and need to be restored or they'll be lost forever.  In this case, the author is talking about the treasures of an entire country and not just one person.<br />But this is just the setting and background.  Hellenga is also able to apply his same sensual descriptions to his characters and describes the thoughts and life of an American woman in Italy quite ably.<br />I've given several copies of \\"The Sixteen Pleasures\\" to my friends, particularly women.  It's that good.  Quite simply, it is sumptuous and sensual and a pleasure to read.<br />Far too many readers make a point of Hellenga being a man.  Donna Tart wrote as a man in \\"The Secret History\\" and Jeffrey Eugenides wrote as a hermaphrodite in \\"Middlesex.\\"  In both cases the authors nailed their characters.  Why so hard to believe that Hellenga, as a man, can't handle a female character?  Besides, anyone with the illusion that Hellenga is all touchy feely only needs to read his book \\"The Fall of the Sparrow\\" in which he describes the life of a typical older professor who has frequent sex with one of his female students.  If anything, he's versatile.  If you love \\"Pleasures\\" you might not be as enthralled with \\"Sparrow\\" which, although a good read in my opinion, just has a different reading audience.	2004-04-01

Besides, I was never one to believe the whole Atlantis nonsense.  Likewise, much of the Bible comes off as myth to me.  So much of what the authors present here is seemingly logical.<br />However, in the very first chapter on page 16 the authors write: \\"Two decades ago some scientists were predicting the impending arrival of a new Ice Age - despite global warming.  (One British scientist, with astounding carelessness, predicted both effects in consecutive radio interviews within two days.\\"<br />This is troubling because it so clearly disregards certain theories that do indeed have legitimacy in pointing towards _both_ global warming and a new Ice Age.  For example, there are scientists who believe that the melting ice caps (caused by global warming) are lowering the temperature of ocean water around Europe which could cause a form of an Ice Age for the region.  One can't be certain as to the scientist they're mocking, but the quick dismissal of this view is troubling because recent evidence suggests that both are distinctly possible without contradicting each other.<br />Have the authors, in their rush to judgement, made the same mistakes elsewhere in the book?  I have no idea.<br />So much of this kind of history is theory so I can't be too hard on the authors.  However, I do think one needs to have a little bit of skepticism in the portions of the book where the authors are too quick to dismiss a viewpoint without fully explaining why its wrong.  And oddly enough, they seem to spend quite a bit of effort going after theories that most people, at least that I'm aware of, don't put much stock into in the first place.<br />The theory of Atlantis, for example, is given quite a bit of ink.  This seems odd because it is rather a fanciful theory to begin with.  The evidence put forth by the author's here is enjoyable to read and logical.<br />I leave the other gaps in the book to those with more knowledge.  Suffice to say, I could do without some of the authors' tone in the book which was at times a little too arrogant.  But still, it's a good read and a _start_.  Given their views about weather patterns, I'd recommend doing further research before taking their views as the end of the debate.	2004-03-31

By far, the Oxford Illlustrated is most enjoyable to use.  I could even use the word fun.<br />Unfortunately, many professional book reviewers state that this dictionary is used primarily for a home with children or a classroom.  While it is a great book for that demographic, it's a also a sheer pleasure for any adult.<br />Gone are the days of simplistic pencil drawings and flat lifeless paper.  This dictionary has thousands of interesting illustrations and glossy paper.  It's about as multi-media a book can get without being a computer program. Perhaps this does sound like it's only for kids.  But it's not.  It's truly a dictionary that almost anyone can open up and actually just enjoy looking at and reading - on almost any given page.  This isn't something one can say about any dictionary before DK and Oxford got together to publish this book.<br />Obviously, if you're looking primarily for word history and extensive multipe definitions this dictionary isn't for you.<br />The original version of the Illustrated Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1998 at 1008 pages.  This new edition, published in 2003, is described on the DK web site as &quot;completely updated.&quot;  I haven't been able to do direct comparisons, but given the fact that this edition is also 1008 pages the update couldn't have been too substantial.  However, given that there were errors in the earlier edition and certain ommitted current words, it's best to go with this most recent edition.	2004-03-25

It appears that they wanted to make Scrabble a more family game and thus believed the removal of the bad words was necessary.<br />Obviously, you don't want your kid using certain four letter words on the board.  However, removing these words is rather dishonest.  They're words, period, and you can't place a value judgement on whether they're acceptable or not to include in a dictionary.  It's like removing certain portions of a science or literature book because someone might be offended.  As a result, many hardcore Scrabble players have refused to use the 3rd edition.<br />I'm sure many people, especially parents, will have no trouble with any of this.  But for serious Scrabble players it's necessary to have a dictionary that determines all acceptable words.  So what to do?  Use both the 2nd and 3rd editions.  While it's no longer being published, you can find the 2nd edition in either soft or hardcover on auction sites and at used book stores for a reasonable price.	2004-03-25

It is wonderfully devoid of the gung ho jingoistic machismo we so often see in today's political debate.  While Stern's observations might not win votes, it is psychologically and sociologically logical and coherent.  If only the policitians would heed the information Stern has presented we might actually defeat terrorism in the long term.<br />Unfortunately, how Stern has presented her information is rather dry to say the least.  A quick glance confirms her background at Harvard University.<br />&quot;In this chapter I will explain . . . &quot;  is the classic academic style of a first sentence of a chapter.  This might be fine for a thesis paper, it is not for a book for public consumption.  This severely detracts from the possible larger reading audience Stern could have had had she used a more interesting approach.<br />I'd rather listen to material like this than read it, so I recommend the audio version over the original text.  It's abridged and it suffers from Stern's dry reading style, but it is easier to digest overall.<br />The other issue which another reviewer raised was whether or not Stern actually spoke to terrorists given how misognystic Islamic extremists can be.  The idea is that such people would not talk to a woman.<br />As someone who has also travelled to the Middle East, including Iraq in 1998 when I met many Iraqi soldiers, I have observed many Muslims, good and bad, separate in social settings how they behave towards a Muslim Arab woman versus how they might behave towards a liberal white woman born in the U.S.  While they won't tolerate the behavior of the former, they will the latter.<br />Obviously, this is not to suggest that all Arabs and Muslims are alike or that what I observed is also symptomatic of terrorists.  But it does suggest that some people with strong religious beliefs do indeed have a surprising level of cultural tolerance in certain circumstances.<br />It's impossible to prove either way if Stern actually spoke with terrorists. Could a man prove beyond a doubt that he had?  Just as likely he could not.  Thus, I would not so easily dismiss Stern's experiences and insight just because she is a woman.  There's ample evidence here to show that Stern knows exactly what she's talking about.	2004-03-25

I can only offer my apologies to the many Datlow fans out there.  And I'm one of them.<br />I've read all six of the fairly tale/fantasy anthologies that Ellen Datlow created with Terry Windling.  Of those, I would give five stars to five out of the six volumes.  They were all that good.  Perhaps I simply have expecations carried over from those books which simply don't apply here.  In those books the stories tended to have a point or a moral.  That's the nature of many fairy tales.  Obviously, this is much less so with ghost stories.<br />The problem I have with &quot;The Dark&quot; is not only that many of the stories didn't seem to have a point to make, it's that the book misrepresents itself on the cover.  The image you see is of a cloudy night with bats flying eerily through the sky.  It denotes gothic, damp and foggy stories about being lost in the woods, visiting an eastern European country, or a ghost story from a hundred years ago.  To give Datlow credit, she explains in her introduction that these are &quot;new&quot; ghost stories that sometimes tell about spirits appearing in mid-day to demand their revenge.  But she also states that she hopes the stories will keep readers awake at night.<br />And that, essentially, is what the problem is.  Some of these stories are excellent literary character studies.  For example, &quot;The Trentino Kid,&quot; the first story in the book, is a good look at a clam digger having to confront the lack of direction in his life.  It's a very good read.  But it is not that scary.  There are other stories that follow the same pattern - such as &quot;The Silence of the Falling Stars&quot; about a park ranger in Death Valley.<br />Then there the stories that just shouldn't be in the book at all.  I have no idea why &quot;The Dead Ghost&quot; is even in this anthology.  It comes off as an exercise from a college writing course.  It's not that the writing is bad - it's not - it's that it's a single scene with no emotional build-up.<br />If you're looking for just good stories with an element of supernaturual, buy this book.  If you're looking for something that keeps you awake at night, look elsewhere.	2004-03-23
US	52960264	R2DZCYQ1LK9GY1	5552319761	243451349	Waking the Dead	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Interesting &amp; unrealistic combination of romance &amp; politics	I so badly wanted to give this novel five stars.  As someone who's heavily into political issues (worked on a Congressional campaign, ten year+ issue activist, etc.) and a sucker for a good romance I was hoping that this book would be both realistic and passionate.  Frankly, while the story certainly is interesting, it's really not that realistic.<br />The author apparently felt like he needed to create a dichotomy to have conflict between his two characters.  So Sarah is the ultra radical and Fielding is the more pragmatic politician type.  The problem is, neither character is given realistic scenarios to play out these roles.<br />What ultimately happens to Sarah is, historically, more in line with what happened to radicals in the sixties who set off bombs - not someone who is the target of a bomb.  Sarah might have been rescuing Chilean exiles and breaking US law, but that hardly puts her at the top of the FBI's most wanted list.  Certainly not in comparison to folks like the Weather Underground which existed at the time.<br />I also wasn't comfortable with the author's presentation of what drove Sarah to do what she did.  There's a lot of religious talk that just either made me uncomfortable or just didn't ring true.  Having spent quite a bit of time with passionate activists, many of whom do break the law, I just didn't believe that someone would go around saying that any poor downtrodden person could be Jesus.  I suspect that the author did this because maybe he just wasn't sure as to what would drive someone to behave like Sarah.<br />Then there's Fielding the politician.  Since the book is set in the 70s maybe the author should be given some latitude.  Maybe things were different then.  But I doubt it.  In this day and age of money and politics his vision of running for office seems naive at best.  Today it takes no less than a million dollars to win a House seat.  Sometimes it takes a lot more.  With that money comes obligations to special interests.<br />Much is made at the end of the book when Fielding reads letters from some of his constituents who need help.  It almost appears as if the author is trying to compare Fielding with Sarah, as if he is just as much a hero, if not more so, as Sarah.<br />Having lobbied over 50 members of the House and Senate in DC I found this underlying motivation to be naive.  Constituent letters are read by staff members and those staff members do the vast majority of the work in doing the helping.  A member of Congress wouldn't have time for these letters.  The letters a Congressperson would deal with would be those that would further his or her political ambitions.  In other words, those that would make good press and PR.<br />In a realistic story Sarah would have continued her work.  And yes, she possibly would have been killed.  But this would have likely only happened after she was better known publicly for her actions - and a far greater threat to those she was protesting.  Maybe then the novel would have focused more on the possible harm Sarah's actions might cause to Fielding's career.<br />In a more realistic story Fielding, if he is as honorable as the author wants us to believe, would have lost his election.  Why?  Because in order for Fielding to stay true to his idealism he would have had to stand up to the special interests who would demand his support.  That's the political reality we live in.  You don't get into Congress by being a good boy.  You do it by bending yourself to the powers that be.<br />Then there's the background story behind Sarah's death.  The US did indeed participate and support the military coup that destroyed the Allende government in Chile.  This was an atrocious act and, unfortunately, not the only one committed by the US government in the region.  In \\"Operation Condor,\\" for example, six South American nations had organized assassination programs to kill political dissidents.  The US government knew about these killings and there's even some evidence to suggest that we supported them.<br />I mention these points because there's a central truth behind Sarah's actions.  What the US did was morally reprehensible.  So while Sarah's actions are extreme, one has to ask, when confronted by the facts, why is Sarah is so \\"radical\\" for her beliefs?  Why aren't those who ignore these things seen as lazy Americans who have utterly failed in their civic responsibility in questioning the actions of their government?  Ah, but then there would be no book.  Who wants to read something like that?<br />For those interested in finding out more about this background story I recommend the movie \\"Missing\\" with Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon or the book \\"Missing: The Execution of Charles Horman\\" by Thomas Hauser.  Both are far more realistic in their depiction of the US government's actions toward Chile in the 1970s.	2004-02-16

Unfortunately, it only took me seconds to see that the author had a very specific ideology that was ignoring other psychological and historical viewpoints.  For example, the author points out that &quot;adults are on time&quot; and that being late is an &quot;act of passive aggressiveness.&quot;  While this can be true many times, it is certainly not true all the time.  Anyone who knows the Jungian based Myers-Briggs personality test will know that &quot;perceivers&quot; are notoriously late because they get easily distracted while &quot;judgers&quot; are frequently early for every appointment.  But in the author's world, only the &quot;J&quot; personality type is &quot;mature.&quot;  Another statement the author makes, on the very same page, is that being adult means &quot;raising your own children.&quot;  Sounds fair on its face.  However, it ignores historical and economic facts.  The nuclear family of two parents and children is a 20th century creation.  In the past, societies had extended families that were heavily involved in the rearing of the children while parents worked.  This is still true in many societies even today.  So how does this become a definition of maturity across the board?  I don't get it.  Obviously, people shouldn't just have children willy-nilly and ignore their needs.  But the author's perspective is pretty much B&amp;W.  Their is no gray.  (IMO, this is in itself a statement of immaturity.)  The whole thing just smacks of a certain political mindset.  My advice: Take the Myers-Briggs test, find out what you are, figure out what parts of your personality need some work.  This is a far better solution than having this author spoon feed you her personal views.	2003-12-04
US	52960264	R3TRW3IHKX0B0N	0374199698	298109609	Middlesex: A Novel	Books	5	9	13	N	N	An interesting and profound novel about gender and identity	Like many fans of the \\"Virgin Suicides,\\" I was impatient to read another book by Eugenides.<br />The author seems to be on the brink of something profound.  In \\"Suicides\\" it was about motivation and secrets.  Why did the girls kill themselves?  This question seemed only partially answered.  In \\"Middlesex\\" Eugenides once again takes on a taboo topic which is at different turns is both more and less successful than \\"Suicides.\\"<br />\\"Middlesex\\" is an important novel because it explodes certain myths about sex and gender.  Eugenides' Callie/Cal bluntly states her/his position in the novel -  he/she is both male and female.  Nature didn't trump nurture and nurture didn't trump nature.  They melded together to make her/him emotionally androgynous.  This is the reason why I believe this novel is so profound.  Life is frequently gray and Eugenides applies this basic principle to his novel.  I particularly liked how Cal, even as a \\"man,\\" states his dislike of other men.  It reminds me of all the heterosexual men out there who playfully refer to themselves as lesbians.  They're attracted to women, have true friendships with women, and generally can't stand the company of other men.  To read all the relationship self-help books on the market you wouldn't even know that such men existed.<br />Despite certain criticisms of this novel, the history of Callie's/Cal's family is extremely important to the story.  It shows how the central character arrived at the final destination.  Not only that, the long family history is quite interesting.  I'm not sure why anyone would think it was boring to read about the destruction of Smyrna, life in a Greek village or immigrants arriving at Ellis Island and migrating west.  These details only add further depth and meaning to the novel.<br />It would have been nice to have more information about Cal's life as a man and what he went through in his evolution as an adult.  But still, this is a minor detail overall.  Eugenides sprinkles details about Cal's life as an adult throughout the novel.  It would have been nice to have more information, 20 or so pages perhaps, about what it was like in his 20s.<br />The other criticism which I have to agree with is Eugenides cutesy labeling of Callie's/Cal's brother as \\"Chapter Eleven.\\"  When I first saw this I thought that the publisher had made a printing error.  I even did a search on the Internet to see if this was the case.  It was simply distracting to read \\"Chapter Eleven\\" over and over and think of a real person.  I can imagine this came up with Eugenides' editor at some point.  I can even picture them debating about whether this was an effective way to be funny.  Frankly, it wasn't.  I think Eugenides could have said this was his brother's nickname, but to use this name over and over, without ever using the real name, was annoying and seemed contrived.<br />Overall, I'd give \\"Middlesex\\" 4 1/2 stars.  Eugenides' two novels have been so good, I just hope I don't have to wait another ten years for his next novel.	2003-05-22

Watson's Laura is a step in that direction.  I just wish I could recommend it more.<br />The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a healthy major female charater in the entire book.  Both Laura and the mother are overly critical and negative while the girlfriend and wife are spineless wimps.<br />Yes, we need more books about what men feel.  But does it have to be at the cost of deprecating women?  This is truly a well written book for the most part.  I just don't understand why  Watson couldn't have been more fair handed with the female characters.	2003-05-22
US	52960264	R19JJUQMJI5U8E	1893224740	411398373	When You Ride Alone You Ride with Bin Laden: What the Government Should Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism	Books	4	115	137	N	N	Maher is both an idiot & a genius. Buy the book anyway.	I both love and hate this book at the same time.  I imagine Maher brings out this response from many people.  I do agree with many of Maher's libertarian views, despite being \\"liberal.\\"  But still, he's got some ideas that he can't back up with facts.<br />One of my major beefs is that Maher seems to believe that we are at war with Islam -- all of Islam. Such views are not helpful.  They only make matters worse by putting everyone in the same category.  If we judged Christians as being all like Jerry Falwell no one who believed in Christ would look good either.<br />Maher's support of profiling Arabs also doesn't make sense.  There are tons of scenerios in which an old lady, a child, or a love struck 20 something could accidentally bring a bomb on board a plane.  It's not about knowledge or intent, it's about manipulation.  I want the old ladies frisked, including my mother! Why? Because some people are too trusting and just might make a mistake.<br />There are other views expressed or, unfortunately, outright ignored.  In one poster he highlights the stoning of Muslim women while at the same time ignoring the rape and brutualities towards women here in the US.  In another essay he demands more funding for the Pentagon, the agency that gets more than 50 percent of the discretionary budget and was judged by the GAO as being the most mismanaged federal agency in the entire US government.  Please!  In another poster & essay he supports the reporting of suspicious activities to the government.  On its face, that might make sense.  But then remember how many idiots there are out there and how many people have an axe to grind with someone else.<br />The good posters and essays, on the other hand, hit dead center.  The \\"why they hate\\" us posters are great as is Maher's support for better pay and respect for firefighters, soldiers and police officers.  The pages focusing on our over consumption of oil are perhaps the best, most notably the one on the front cover.<br />Despite these criticisms, Maher brings a lot of ideas to the table.  God knows we need more of that right now when so many people are so quick to throw the \\"un-American\\" label at those who dissent.  Which brings me to one of the better posters & essays in the book: Speaking out IS an act of patriotism.  I'll grant that to Maher, even if I disagree with half of what he says.	2002-11-04

The analysis of the US dominated policy toward Iraq is dead on accurate.  On the inside flap of the book there are three quotes, the first being one from a member National Security Council in 1991: \\"Our goal is to remove Saddam Hussein, not his regime.\\"<br />This quote reveals the US policy not just toward Iraq, but is also useful in understanding what the US did in Afghanistan: The US government purposely and willfully destroyed attempts to extradite bin Laden -- just as it has destroyed all popularly supported methods to remove Saddam from power.  As the book says so bluntly, it's about leadership change, not regime change in Iraq. As for Afghanistan, as Sen. Biden, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put it, \\"The worst outcome would be if bin Laden was extradited.\\"<br />About the only negative remark I can make about this book is that it's mostly from a British perspective and might not be the best choice for American readers.  No matter, I urge everyone to read this book, buy it, give it to your friends, especially the ones who think that President Bush is doing the right thing.  I have never recommended a book on Iraq this way.  But this one is that good and more important than ever as we face a potential war in Iraq.	2002-10-31

That's just an illogical fallacy.  Sometimes things are just wrong, period, and we need time to figure out what will work.<br />My problem with this book is that it doesn't deliver what it promises.  The &quot;through the looking glass&quot; approach is restricted primarily to boxed in asides throughout the book where the author gives us unusual perspectives or anecdotes that will either make you laugh or cry.  These portions of the book are by far the best and the most original.  Unfortunately, this is only a small percentage of the book's contents.<br />The majority of the text comes off as pure rants.  Justified rants, mind you, but rants nonetheless.  If you're heavily active in progressive causes this will likely leave you cold.  Who needs more complaining about the obvious?  If, however, you're new to progressive causes, anti-corporate globalization, etc. or aren't that active then this might be a great place to start.<br />I can only offer a partial recommendation for this book.  It has a select audience, one that I'm most definitely not a part of.  I just really wish Galeano had stuck to the parts that worked.  Many of the asides are brillant little tid bits of information that will force you to look at things differently.  But the rest is just the same old same old depressing news you can get off any activist web site.	2002-07-24
US	52960264	R2FLER7QDNJBRO	1561632791	578895102	2024	Books	3	8	12	N	N	A mixed bag	True, 2024 has some biting commentary and it's most definitely food for thought.  But even as someone who agrees with Rall's views, particularly in his regular work, including comics and articles, I still think this is an overblown comic book all prettied up for a hardcover book.  There's just not enough meat here to justify the format.<br />The characters are rather plain and have very little distinguishing characteristics.  I think that's part of Rall's point -- people losing their individuality.  However, even 1984, which I'm honestly not a fan of in terms of general fiction readability, had better characters than this.<br />2024 is good, but it's really just an overpriced comic book with a good message.	2002-07-18

This explanation, unfortunately, does not do the book justice.<br />It is, quite simply, probably the best book you can find to show a child -- maybe even a adult! -- that war is just stupid.  The graphics are also quite good and complement the text quite nicely.<br />I've purchased over a dozen copies of this book over the years as gifts.

Suffice to say, Armstrong has written a logical analysis of Gensis that will likely offend some fundamentalists, but will ring true to others, from Christians who don't take the Bible literally to agnostics or atheists who just wish to learn a little more.<br />While I enjoyed this book immensely, readers should be aware that the original meat of the material, excluding the actual text of Genesis, is less than 120 pages -- and these are small pages.  If this book was printed in typical hardback dimensions the original content written by Armstrong would likely be no more than 80 pages.  I simply wish that Ms. Armstrong had either lengthened her analysis and discussion or had gone on to other books in the Bible.  I want a little more bang for my buck if I'm going to buy a book.<br />What's here is great, there's just so little of it.  Buyers should just be aware that they're buying a very short read.	2002-06-02
US	52960264	R16464KWLWM5WG	1569471797	417696766	Moghul Buffet (Soho Crime)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Amusing feminist mystery with uneven gender depictions	Humor and feminist fiction in the same breath?  Is such a thing possible?  Author Cheryl Benard certainly seems to be proving her point with her first novel, \\"Moghul Buffet.\\"  I read her second novel, \\"Turning on the Girls,\\" and found it to be neck deep in sarcasm and humor, but also naive and judgmental.  Regardless, I was so blown away by Benard's satire and skewering of her subjects that I just had to check out her earlier work.<br />There are so many sub-plots to Moghul that I'm not even going to try to describe them all.<br />It's odd that the \\"official\\" description of this book is slanted towards the male perspective. Micky Malone and Iqbal are important characters, but the story doesn't revolve around them.  Indeed, the main character is Fatima, a sixteen year old girl who's raped by a fanatical Muslim zealot and then forced into prostitution by the female head housekeeper.  Things go from bad to worse for Fatima as she is threatened and beaten by the various men in her life.  At the core of the story is the farcical notion that Fatima is behind all the mysterious murders that are taking place in Peshawar. <br />Just like \\"Girls,\\" Benard has created something that defies categorization.  \\"Moghul\\" is fiction, murder mystery, feminist theory, social commentary and humor all wrapped into a small package of 264 pages.  And also just like \\"Girls,\\" Benard targets everyone from US imperialism to Muslim misogyny.  Take, for example, the following passages:<br />\\"Before interrogating or accusing an American, Iqbal, ask yourself one thing: is this person worth an F-14 fighter jet?\\"<br />And:<br />\\"A good Muslim man prefers his women to die modestly, in his tent.  And a good Muslim woman, \\" Mara lectures, in the hopes of grinding on the nerves of the Muslim woman who stands before her, \\"if she has any decency at all, will prefer to be shoveled straight into her grave rather than display her body to one of the leering, depraved foreign doctors who staff our clinics.\\"<br/>Perhaps other readers will blanch at such passages, particularly the latter, but I found myself at least chuckling as Benard took her aim and fired.  At the very least, she's consistent, not tolerating the excesses of either Western or Eastern cultures. <br />With that said, I can see at least two patterns in Benard's writing that are quickly getting on my nerves. <br />For one, both \\"Moghul\\" and \\"Girls\\" have moments where Benard interjects her sarcastic omnipotent narrator perspective.  It is funny at times.  In fact, she can be frequently hilarious.  However, she's followed the same pattern in both her first and second novels.  As a new fan of her biting social commentary, I hope her third ditches this repetitive device.  It works once, maybe twice, but continuing to rely on it will only reflect her inability to create something new.<br />My second major criticism is almost identical to what I thought of \\"Girls.\\"  Ms. Benard needs to seriously get out in the world and meet different kinds of men.  Both books generally had two kinds of males:  Those who were violent, and mean (alpha males) and those who were kind and considerate but are absolutely clueless about the realities of gender issues (perhaps on the cusp of being beta males).  In the case of \\"Moghul,\\" Benard presents countless men who fit the former description and three of the latter.  These include the American Micky Malone, Fatima's protective brother, and a college student who believes that Fatima is a righteous prostitute because she \\"represents all the oppressed of the Third World.\\"  Benard is particularly harsh on all three of these males and more than once illustrates their ignorance by pointing out how convenient it is for them to talk about gender justice and equality while obviously conveniently inhabiting the body of a privileged male.  Only once does Benard divert from this path when it's revealed that Micky was forced as a child to suffer the beatings and humiliation of larger males.<br />This is the same pattern in \\"Girls\\":  The women always get it, the men, at best, try but still remain out in la la land.  This is ridiculous considering both the real world and Benard's own writing.  In direct contrast to the men, Benard presents us with at least four female characters who she, at most, only mildly ridicules.  It was pretty obvious to me that she saw them as realistic, pragmatic, and generally supportive of women's equality.  Fair enough, especially since she also gives us women in the story who oppress other women.  But where are the male equivalents?  In the real world this kind of thing just doesn't wash.  There are sexist patriarchal females and egalitarian males.  Benard, just like in \\"Girls,\\" either doesn't see this part of the world or refuses to interject it into her writing.<br />Despite these criticisms, I'm still a fan of Benard's work.  I love how she's able to reveal society's moral inconsistencies with humor and sarcasm. You won't finish her books and think, \\"Well that was a real downer!\\"  Still, I wish she would expand her horizons a bit.  If she ever happens to read this review, I hope she will get this message:  Please , PLEASE, incorporate some  males who \\"get it\\" into your writing.	2002-05-30
US	52960264	R3GSQ4TPWWMJ86	0374281785	119040288	Turning on the Girls	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Humorous feminist fantasy with major flaws regarding gender	Cheryl Benard's second novel, \\"Turning on the Girls\\", is going to cause debate wherever it's read.  It's part fantasy, part science fiction, part comedy, part novel, part sociology, part . . . well, you get the idea.<br />Don't let the cover of the book deceive you.  I can understand why the publishers chose the image they did -- it specifically relates to the main character's attempt to find \\"acceptable\\" feminist erotica and her repeated encounters with women and men who keep reverting to the stereotypes of the past.  The message you get from the dust jacket  -- all the flowers! -- is not an accurate feel of the book's contents.  This is a feminist fantasy with a humorous edge.<br />This book confused me for quite awhile.  Before I even started reading it I thought that Benard had created just another anti-feminist book.  But I was wrong.  It's obvious that she views certain segments of the feminist camp as a little over the top, perhaps a little too serious, but still respects and honors the feminists of the past and those to come in the future.<br />Benard's humor hits most the target most of the time.  Which brings me to my first warning: If you're uptight about your ideology, about feminism, you're guaranteed to have a least one of your sacred cows sacrificed.  Benard leaves no one unscathed, whether it's New Age herbalists or macho guys with too much testosterone.<br />Benard shows several characters, both men and women, who are disgusted with what they see around them and are just trying to find their way.  Lisa finds makeup disgusting and macho men sexist.  Her work partner, Justin, just really wants to belong and, most importantly, have someone to love.  Benard is going in the right direction, but I don't think she went far enough.<br />True, this book is supposed to be a politically relevant humorous fantasy.  We're not supposed to get hung up on the specifics.  So maybe what I'm about to argue would ruin Benard's entire story.<br />There are two fallaciespresented here that made me decide that, while I did enjoy reading \\"Turning on the Girls\\", I ultimately do NOT like the book's message.<br />First of all, Benard presents the notorious and absolutely wrong view of global sisterhood.  No where in the book do I remember a character being described in terms of race.  Only after I had finished reading did I realize that I had pictured in my mind every single character as white.  There's no mention as to how women were able to mend their fences and work together.  Even more importantly, where did all the conservative women go?  They're not all silly girls who wear long nails and makeup and cow tail to their man.  The leap she makes in this regard -- with no explanation as to how all the various feminists worked together nor an explanation as to what happened to all the patriarchal women -- is disturbing because it helps to continue the fallacy that all feminists are alike.  They're just not.<br />Secondly, I'd like to know why Benard didn't include a single male who was egalitarian.  With the exception of one man, Lisa's final love interest, not a single male in Benard's book is seen as admirable.  Yes, her administrative assistant, Justin, is shown in a positive light overall, but he is still presented as a bit of a wimp and lacking a backbone.  She gives us stereotype after stereotype of males who aren't affectionate (and need pets to learn how to be a caretaker) or men who are slobs (tell that to my brother in-law who rants about my sister's constant creation of clutter!).  True, this all part of the humor, but it's all easy targets.  Going after macho and wimpy men is easy.  So I'm surprised that Benard didn't pick on pro-feminist egalitarian men in this novel.  But alas, they're nowhere to be seen in the text...  I wish that the message of Benard's book was as good as her presentation, but it isn't.  \\"Turning on the Girls\\" is a great read (be warned that it takes several pages in the beginning for Benard to grab the reader) and will create a lot of debate and discussion, but it's ultimately flawed.	2002-05-30

I also think that Chris Matthews is a first class jerk with a completely unethical view on what's acceptable in this world.<br />However, I'm extremely politically active, too.  I bird dog presidential candidates (Bush, McCain, Gore, Bradley), worked on a Congressional campaign, etc. etc. And the truth is, as much as I hate the messenger, Matthews is pretty much dead on here with this book.  If you want to know how the game of politics is currently played, or at least get a taste for it, you should read this book. It doesn't mean you have to like it or think that Matthews is a great guy.  But don't dismiss him out of ideology.  If you do you'll miss out on the opportunity to learn things that you can use to your advantage.<br />Activists, particularly those on the left, need to smarten up if they want to succeed politically.  I certainly don't recommend everything Matthews is suggesting, but he's got some words of wisdom that should be utilized.<br />For example, there's \\"hang a lantern on your problem.\\"  That means, if there's no upside, there's no way to \\"hide\\" your problem, expose it yourself!  In the process you can define it in your own terms and look honorable in the process.  I've used this in my own political work.<br />Then there's \\"Leave no shot unanswered\\" which means you don't let the opposition nail you without coming back with an effective counterstatement.  This, as Matthews points out, needs to be balanced against \\"only speak if it'll improve the silence.\\"  He gives good examples (although at times a little disjointed) on these and several other words of wisdom to the politically active.<br />I can't say I like the playing field, but it is the playing field whether I like it or not.  I can curse it, or use it to my advantage while also applying my own moral standards.<br />If you're a progressive, slog through the baloney -- the fact that this book received a rave review from George Will should give you some indication of what I'm talking about -- but read this book and learn.	2002-05-19

Suffice to say, this is a hard book to categorize.  It's unusual and combines several genres.  Some people might dismiss it as too &quot;out there,&quot; but if they're patient they'll be rewarded with a wonderful and unique book full of idealism and mythology.<br />What makes this book especially intriguing, and perhaps will even help explain some of the content, is Wharton's (not his real name) own life.<br />&quot;A Midnight Clear,&quot; another book written by Wharton which was also made into an excellent movie, tells the story of an intelligence unit during WW II which &quot;illegally&quot; creates a truce with a nearby German unit.  Further research shows that a large portion of &quot;Midnight&quot; is autobiographical.  Wharton himself was in an intelligence unit, was disfigured somewhat, and was also classified as a genius by the military. Parts of this history are also shown in &quot;Franky Furbo.&quot;<br />Wharton's own beliefs were clearly shown when he left the US to live in France.  Apparently, this was due in part to his disillusionment with the United States for its various actions and policies.<br />There's simply not enough space to get into all the details of Wharton's life.  I recommend anyone who reads the book to do further research.  It certainly helps explain &quot;Franky Furbo&quot; because Wharton shares a lot of Franky's beliefs and experiences.  It just makes the story that much more mystical and interesting.<br />A must read for anyone who thinks different or has listened to Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; and agreed that we need to get beyond our nationalism and other oppressive beliefs.	2002-05-19

S.L.A. Marshall's studies which showed that US soldiers in combat during WW II frequently \\"failed\\" to fire their weapons in a manner that would kill the enemy.  The further the soldier was from the target (detachment) or surrounded by other soldiers (peer pressure) the more likely that he would fire.  Grossman uses other evidence to back up Marshall's study.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that Grossman's conclusion on video games is flawed.  Grossman has basically bought into the media hype on teen killings.  Yes, they happen, but not that often!  We only think they do because the media buries us with graphic footage.  School violence, when white middle class white folks weren't the victims, has been going on for decades.  Even now, the vast majority of kids are not violent.  In fact, teen crime has actually gone done!<br /><br />But Grossman's blind sight goes beyond teen violence.  He's essentially focused his entire experience on military training on video games and ignored all other sociological variables.  Video games are simply one variable out of probably a dozen (poverty, some religious beliefs, abusive environments, TV & movies, uninvolved or over worked parents, etc. etc.)  that contribute to violence.  Grossman simply has no leg to stand on by pointing to one and only one single variable.  In psychological and sociological terms it is simply preposterous.<br /><br />Grossman makes another error in judgement, one perhaps to be expected given his military background.  While he is quick to judge video games for kids, he completely ignores the US government's misuse of the military or the misdeeds of soldiers in combat.  Timothy McVeigh proved that what our government gave him permission to do -- killing surrendering Iraqi soldiers -- was the catalyst for his transformation in viewing all human life as unimportant.  But you won't find Grossman criticizing the military here, or more importantly, the greedy & idiotic politicians whodirect that military in the first place.<br /><br />This is one example of Grossman ignoring counter evidence as some modern researchers have found that violence on the domestic front increases when the United States is involved in military operations overseas.<br /><br />One criticism that I've seen of Grossman's book is that the original S.L.A. Marshall study was flawed.  Problem is, no one seems to be able to explain how or why it's flawed.  My own experience in fact bears out Marshall's study.  Before the Gulf War I was in a holding unit with hundreds of other guys waiting to be transferred to various combat units with the 1st Calvary and 10th Armor Divisions.  We would meet outside the barracks -- dozens of us -- and chew the fat over what was happening.  Not once -- not a single time -- did any of these lower enlisted soldiers think the Gulf War was a good idea.  In any case, in my opinion, Marshall's study was dead on. Soldiers aren't as keen as everyone thinks when it comes to killing and dying \\"for the cause.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book for those folks (which is probably a lot) who aren't familar with Marshall's study.  It will be a real eye opener.  Just be aware that Grossman's attempts at using this material to reach broader conclusions is positively flawed.  Essentially, the first four fifths of the book should be required reading and the last fith can be taken with a grain of salt.	2002-05-19

Then, afterwards, the kids would pour out into the playground and beat the ... out of the less popular kids.  This was viewed as \\"OK\\" by the school's religious teachers.<br />What particularly struck me at that time was not my own experiences, but the blatant immorality attributed to God. Even as a child I KNEW that the idea of God slaughtering millions of people just because they didn't believe a certain thing -- even though they were good people overall -- was just wrong.  If God was that way then I wanted no part of it!<br />If you can relate to anythig I've just written then you'll love \\"Stealing Jesus.\\"  It's nothing less than cathartic to read the author's explanations of how, why and where these warped religious beliefs came from.<br />I do have two issues with the book.  First, I have to ditto another reviewer's statements that it's hard to understand why it's necessary for the author to insist upon \\"Christian\\" as a label.<br />Secondly, and more importantly to me, this book, while it's great for those of us who are recovering from fundamentalist extremes, is still a poor choice for those who need it most.  What is soothing to me as a \\"survivor\\" would only be enraging to someone who might otherwise be open to other viewpoints.  I suppose this is not a criticism as much as a clarification.  This book is best used to empower people to respond to funamentalists.  It's a poor choice to offer to fundamentalists to explain your views or change their minds, if such a thing is possible.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It presents the concept of God in a  completely sensical way -- with no moral hypocrisy.	2002-05-19
US	52960264	R37TDYQDMH9F0X	0312151187	709420641	Emerald City: Stories	Books	2	7	16	N	N	Good writing by an author stuck in gender myths	It's true, Jennifer Egan is a good writer.  She's descriptive and eloquent.  The problem is, her characters are all the same and her view on the world is, quite bluntly, annoying and misleading.<br />The majority of the female characters in this book are whimps who have things done to them.  They're victims.  Sure, a lot of them are scruffy \\"survivors,\\" I'll admit as much.  But none of these women are really proactive or, for that matter, perpetrators, at least not on par with the men in these stories.<br />One example where Egan has the \\"victim\\" thing really messed up:  Reliable studies have shown that the \\"First Wives Club\\" mentality is a myth.  The majority of men do not leave their wives for prettier, younger trophy wives.  About 2 thirds of all divorces are actually instigated by the wives.  The men don't come out smelling like tulips here, however.  A large percentage of wives ask for those divorces because they're tired of being super moms or having to take care of their husbands like they're children.  The point is, a lot of women take charge of their lives and are not victims!  As for most men, the idea of a young pretty second wife is typically, in reality, the thing of fantasies.<br />Egan needs to wake up to the world and understand that people are just people. Men get cheated on, women get cheated on, sometimes you're victim, sometimes you're the perpetrator.  This book might be eloquent, but it's also a victim's propaganda -- one that perpetuates myths and adds fuel to the \\"gender war\\" instead of adding to our understanding.  Please, Ms. Egan, get some objectivity.	2002-05-10
US	52960264	R1WY2CGU25O26O	0028642333	807942989	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam (The Complete Idiot's Guide)	Books	2	114	192	N	N	Some great basic info surrounded by rubbish	As a recovering Protestant turned inquiring skeptic of all religions, I've been looking for books that offer a fair and balanced view of various religions.  I'm not so much interested in the warm and fuzzy details, just the cut and dry whys and whats behind various beliefs and practices.<br />Let me just state up front that I am not especially against Islam -- or any other religion.  I have issues with them all.  Also, my last two long term committed relationships were with Muslim raised women.  I bought the book, in part, to help fill in a few blanks.<br />Unfortunately, the author is blatantly biased in favor of Islam and glosses over certain details and, at times, outright lies or omits contradictory information.<br />The author points out that the Muslim World was invaded during the Crusades.  Fair enough.  But then nothing is mentioned about the Muslim invasions of Christian areas.<br />In a race to come off as pro-American and patriotic post 9-11, the author addresses the US policy and actions against Iraq in a blatantly ignorant fashion that few Arabs or Muslims would agree with.  As an expert on the US policy on Iraq, I can say without doubt that there is little support for the sanctions which kill innocent civilians and, in fact, HELP Saddam Hussein.  But to read this book you'd think that all Muslims and Arabs were gung ho for the US policy.  The whole section on Iraq is complete nonsense, devoid of any important background information. (For a good explanation for both the US policies in the Middle East and the atrocities committed by Arab states I strongly recommend Said Aburish's book, Brutal Friendship.  His book on Saddam Hussein is also very good.)<br />What is particularly annoying to me is the author's emphasis on supposed equality between men and women in Islam.  Listen, if you want to believe something, believe in your own terms.  It's as if the author is trying to superimpose western ideals over a system that is blatantly sexist.  For example, the author explains that the reason that women pray in the back of mosques is so that the men won't be distracted.  This is the same reason given for the variations of the head covering.  And then the author has the audacity to say that this is \\"equal\\" treatment!  Obviously, many western women face unwanted sexual advances.  However, regardless of whether you're in the US or in a Muslim country the same truth prevails: It is the responsibility of the MEN to behave themselves.  Saying that a woman must cover herself or that she must hide in the back of a mosque is not \\"equality.\\"  It's the punishment of women for the failure of men to control themselves. This author, without a doubt, has no clue as to what gender equality really means.<br />On the positive side, I gave this book two stars instead of one because there is some basic info provided that will help non-Muslims better understand certain things.  Basic vocabulary and brief histories of various Islamic people and events are all provided.<br />Overall, this book reads like a religious tract that you might find left on your doorstep by people you'd wish would just leave you alone.  I want to emphasize that I would say the same thing about a book that discussed ANY relgion in this manner.  It makes me wonder if the Complete Idiot's Guide(R) series approaches Christianity, Judaism and other religions in the same way. For example, do they defend the Catholic practice of excluding women from leadership positions and then say they support \\"equality\\"?  Do they accept without question the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands? And so on. If that's the case, I plan to avoid the entire series!<br />If you want to learn about religion without feeling like the author is trying to convert you, without feeling like you're being manipulated, then I recommend that you look elsewhere.	2002-03-31
US	52960264	R1Z0LQ9ZMBEASC	1583220704	953429448	Blake's Therapy: A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Powerful commentary that raises more questions than answers	Blake's Therapy raises a lot of issues and, in my opinion, leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  But it many ways that's OK.  At the very least, it will make you think.<br />I'm giving the book four stars instead of five because I really think the book should have been longer.  Dorfman has paced the book quite fast . . . you zip along from one surprise to another.  But I would have liked to have had more.  I want to know more about the background of the characters, particularly those who act out Blake's whims.  I wanted to know more about the company that was giving Blake the &quot;therapy.&quot;  These are just two examples.<br />Dorfman offers us many intriguing mysteries, but then doesn't give us the answers.<br />Despite these criticisms, it's a very good book.  Those claiming that Dorfman doesn't understand CEOs are missing the point. Blake, given his interests and the company he created, resembles the kind of person you might find working at Patagonia, Ben &amp; Jerry's, The Body Shop, or Working Assets -- companies that are dually committed to both a profit and progressive political ideals.  Blake is believable in that role.<br />But even then, in the broader sense, if Dorfman isn't offering us a realistic CEO, one has to wonder how morally ambivalent a real CEO would be before they would care about their employees.  If Dorfman is offering us an unrealistic vision -- a CEO who cares &quot;too much&quot; perhaps? -- then it makes for a damming commentary, not on Dorfman's work, but on the world we live in.  Because overall, Blake is a good guy.  He wants to make a profit like the rest of us, but he doesn't want to destroy the planet in the process and he wants to help people at the same time.  He feels guilt when he fails at doing these things.  One only has to look at Enron to realize that many CEOs aren't like that.	2002-03-31
US	52960264	R3S7BIA3F51AHK	0684867230	483289132	Walter's Purple Heart	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Not as good as her previous work	I came across Pay It Forward, one of Hyde's earlier novels that was made into a movie, by accident one day and thought I'd give it a shot.  I liked it.  It had some flaws, but it showed a certain psychological slant that I appreciated in a writer. It seemed to me that Catherine Ryan Hyde was able to place characters in real, honest, tough life dilemmas and bring them out of it with some diginity and, more importantly, a strong sense of optimism and strength despite what they've been through.  I wanted to read more.<br />Within weeks I had read her earlier works, Funerals for Horses and Earthquake Weather. Quite honestly, Earthquake Weather is one of the best collections of short stories I've ever read.  And Funerals is very convincing in its depiction of family abuse and is, IMO, eloquent in its symbolism, mythology and spirituality. They both confirmed my first impression: Hyde's writing is both optimistic and realistic and can be, at times, almost soothing to the soul.  I was beginning to think that Catherine Ryan Hyde could do no wrong.<br />Well, I was wrong.  Electric God, Ryan's last book before Walter's Purple Heart, while having many of the earlier positive elements, had several fatal flaws, not the least of which was a central male character who was hard to love -- a man who could have come right out of a bad romance novel.  You know the type: Bad boy who needs to mend his ways and secretly has a heart of gold, if only a woman would help him.<br />Now we have Walter's Purple Heart.  As a fan of Hyde's first three books (Horses and Earthquake hit a very deep nerve with me), I'm disheartened to see her work get worse and worse.<br />The central character is a mix between \\"Michael,\\" a young dope smoker with very few goals in life, and \\"Walter,\\" a soldier killed in WWII who left a loving fiance behind and now inhabits the body of Michael.  The basic idea of the story was to resolve both Michael's and Walter's problems.  While Michael redeems himself by the endof the novel, his character is just not appealing.  I can see that Hyde was trying to create some sort of character transformation within her tale, but I simply couldn't feel for a California slacker who's stoned half the time.<br />As an Army veteran (although I never saw combat, I was trained in weapons capabilities), I didn't find Walter's military experiences believable.  There's one reference to Walter getting hit by a friendly fire mortar round.  The way Hyde describes it you'd think that mortar rounds were just like bullets.  They're not -- they're designed to kill a maim as many people as possible within a certain radius.  It seemed that Hyde knew she was on shaky territory in trying to describe the military scenes because she offers so little description and dialogue in these parts of the book.<br />On the positive side, although some might disagree, I found the sexual tension between Michael and Walter's old sweetheart, Mary Ann, convincing and even at times erotic.  That's quite an accomplishment considering the fact that Michael is in his 20s and Mary Ann about 60.  Let's face it, if the sexes were reversed most people wouldn't think twice.  So I congratulate Hyde in pulling this off.<br />Overall, Walter's Purple Heart is a great concept that needed more work and a least one character change (Michael).  I needed more realistic dialogue and characterization.  Or in other words, I needed Hyde to approach her subject like she did in Funderals For Horses.  If she'd done this I'd wager that this book could have easily been another 100 pages in length -- and gone from a fluffy piece on reincarnation to a profound perspective on love and redemption.<br />I wouldn't discourage fans of Catherine Ryan Hyde from reading this book.  However, if you've never read anything else by her this is a poor place to start.  Check out Funerals and Earthquake and then decide from there if you want to read her more recent work.	2002-03-27

It's unebelievable that it's out of print!  This book, in very simple terms, offers an explanation for just about every romantic trouble -- the imbalance between partners.  I looked at &quot;Relationship Rescue,&quot; yet another new psychobabble book on the block and there's no comparison.  Where McGraw gives you &quot;men are this way, women are that way, deal with it,&quot; Delis offers real insights on what and how power imbalances occur and even points out that those in gender stereotyped relationships are actually prone to more problems!  I'm divorced and have had my share of breakups -- this book nails every single one of my previous relationships. As one previous reviewer wrote, this should be mandatory reading in high school.<br />Bring this book back into print!	2001-06-30

But some people, including myself, DON'T.  I saw McGraw on Oprah once and his examples in the audience were complete box cut out stereotypes.  A husband who &quot;wasn't emotional&quot; and excessively detail oriented and organized, a wife who was &quot;emotional&quot; and less organized.  These are right out of the Jungian based Myers-Briggs personality test: Judging (masculine) versus perceiving (feminine).  So, this applies to SOME people.  But if you're a man who doesn't watch sports, a woman who does, a guy who cries, a woman doesn't, etc. etc., well, forget McGraw's book.  (If you're a gay or lesbian, the same is also certainly true.)  For people who are a little bit of this and a little bit of that in terms of gender this book is complete and utter rubbish.  It might help others, however.  My objection isn't that this book isn't helpful for some (maybe many), it's that McGraw INSISTS that everyone fits within his cookie cut out patterns.  (Just like Gray and Tannen!)  The best I can give it is two stars.  From my personal perspective, it doesn't even deserve that.  Authors such as McGraw need to get a broader perspective on reality and meet people who don't fit the stereotypes.	2001-02-07
US	52960264	R31GD5VXUFL9LD	0874869595	179646685	Hell Healing and Resistance: Veterans Speak	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Unfortunate that critics can't see the truth in this book	The critiques of this book from supposed veterans is disturbing.  It is indeed true that many American soldiers (most, surely) did not and have not committed war crimes.  However, to totally ignore history and overwhelming evidence smacks of ultra nationalistic pride and an unwillingness to look into your own heart.<br />A Marine officer, a colonel I believe, when finding out about the My Lai massacre commented, &quot;Every brigade has its My Lai.&quot;  I have no idea how many brigades served in Vietnam, but even one My Lai was too much!<br />There are in fact extensive personal narrative history books from not just the Vietnam War, but other wars as well, including WW I, II, and Korea that PROVE the reality of this book.  The truth is, soldiers from all countries, INCLUDING from the U.S., have committed atrocious and morally reprehensible war crimes.  To suggest otherwise is blind ignorance and pride.<br />And to argue that the US government always prosecutes perpetrators?!  Certainly not.  The soldiers involved in the true incident depicted in the movie &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (having read the original nonfiction text I can assure all that the movie is very faithful to the truth) received, only a few years of prison time.  And even then, the soldier who brought them to justice had to fight for months and months for the US Army to do something about the rape and murder of a young village girl.  And that is just one story of many that could be told . . . Again, it's laughable to think that the US government would actively prosecute its own soldiers.  History has proven otherwise again and again.<br />I salute those who have gone into combat.  But that doesn't deny the reality of war.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-02-02
