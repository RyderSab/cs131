While it's not sidesplitting funny, it certainly is an amusing  little collection around its theme and good for more than a chuckle or two.  If you are in the writing or publishing business you'll recognize all the  characters and situations and it will be a lot funnier for you than for  most.	2000-04-23

I bought this book to help me with my geneological research in our family surname.  This is book is exactly what the title says it is.  It is a listing of all marriage records for these two states for the time period  indicated.  Names are alphabetical by both husband and wife.  The  information however, is the the couples names, the date, and the  location....and nothing more.  Unless you plan to do a great deal of  research, you'd be just as well off if you got this from the library.  It's  an expensive investment for one or two names and a date....unless you sell  it afterwards.	2000-04-23

The characters are presented to us on several levels and none are as simple as they first appear.  Each is good and evil in his/her own way. But they are searched by the Eyes and Ears of Pharaoh and his adopted son. As the story  unrolls, it is possible to solve it as you read if you pay careful  attention to detail and the motivations of the characters. I strongly  recommend the book and the series.	2000-04-03

It was a wonderful trip into a time and place we can never go otherwise. I recommend it strongly.  The plot is intricate, strong and solvable by those who look  carefully.	2000-04-03

And the question is:<br /> &quot;Why should you never play chess with a dragon?&quot;<br /> In the distant future, man isn't a whole lot smarter than he is today.  We join the great horde in the galaxy thinking that  everything is for free.  When the bill comes due, it's a shocker.<br /> But we  find out quickly through our cast that the whole things a rigged game being  played with loaded dice; con artists abound; and talk is definitely not  cheap.<br /> This book is a fast but delightful read. The alien cultures are  neatly delivered with insight into their way of doing things.  And  philanthopists they're not.<br />I strongly recommend &quot;Chess With a  Dragon&quot; especially if you have a sense of humor.	2000-04-03

They were a wonderful glimpse into the life of thousands of years ago.  Details of daily life that are given to us in the paintings and pieces that were left behind are wonderful. I'm  looking foward to the ones I haven't read. I have no bones to pick at all  with he great grasp of the time and the politics.	2000-04-03

The story is about the woman warrior Tomoe Gozen and how she came to wield the wonderful  sword called the Golden Naginata. This book is the second in the series - a  compelling story - I enjoyed being immersed in another time and another way  of life.	2000-04-03

There's a  feeling of comfort since you know them, even if you don't particularly find them attractive.<br />The opening will be confusing if you don't know the characters and maybe will be anyway.  It  jumps from a scene being filmed to the action and back again.  In the end  you see the same cast as the original movie doing pretty much the same  stuff as before.<br />I found the book to be tedious as he retold old scenes  from the movie and wove them into the new plot.  I would rather have had  new material covering new ground entirely, but that is a personal  preference.<br /> I did not finish this book completely and probably will not  do so.	2000-04-03
