I had a lot of questions, and this book does a good job of providing answers to many common questions and technical details behind making the switch.<br /><br />The author goes into great detail on both telephone-type broadband service (Vonage, one of the author's favorites) and computer-based Softphone systems (Skype, for example).  He explains various packages, benefits and technical details behind each.  For example, I want to keep my traditional telephones since for some reason my 15-year old, as computer-savy as he is, seems to have this need to \\"grasp\\" onto a traditional telephone receiver.  Thanks to this book, I now know how to hook-up those phones (directly to the router provided by the broadband provider) and how to make sure that I maintain my current coverage throughout the house (get a base station phone setup with remote stations).  I also found out a lot about how the services that are available as they compare to my traditional phone company today, and some of the pitfalls as well -- Fax machines don't work with broadband service without an extra fee from most providers, and my ADT alarm system is going to need to be retrofitted.<br /><br />If you are curious as to how broaband phones work (and also want a short, but good overview of how traditional phones work) the author starts the book off with going behind the scenes to explain the details.  How does my call from my broadband phone reach my mother, who still believes that computers are those strange machines in the basements of banks and other big companies that manage to overcharge her, who still uses a service provided by Ma Bell?  How can I live in Missouri, but have a number in Las Vegas?  How can I go on a month-long vacation and still receive all my phone calls? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie-Roll pop?  Ok, so maybe the author doesn't cover that last one.<br /><br />About the only gripe I had with this book was the author does a lot of moaning about the traditional phone companies.  I am no big fan either, but I still realize they are necessary and will be so for many, many years to come.  I also would have liked to seen a little less emphasis given to just Vonage and Skype, though to be fair they are the major market players at this stage in the game.<br /><br />A good read for those considering making the switch.  It's written well and is it times humorous which makes for a very easy read.the author doesn't cover that last one. <br /> <br />About the only gripe I had with this book was the author does a lot of moaning about the traditional phone companies.

Once a language relegated to scripting-use only, it has developed over the years into a full-featured language around which applications are being developed from.  For example, there are numerous front-end web applications that are built around Perl not to mention in my own line of work we use a number of Perl applications to process and manipulate incoming data.  The little kid has finally grown up and matured!<br /><br />In Pro Perl, the author takes you through an in-depth analysis of the Perl language from the beginning topics up to advanced topics (including a relatively new one for Perl, Object Oriented programming).  Many Perl books have a habit of either showing you the basics, and leaving you yearning for more; or showing you advanced topics that you are left scratching your head wondering \\"How did they jump from A to Z with no in-between\\"?  In Pro Perl the author has taken an approach of explaining the concepts and walking you through the introduction and leading you to the more advanced topics without breaking it into distinct pieces of beginning, novice, etc.  The book can be considered more of a instructional reference manual more than a code-snippet type book, which many programming books are nowadays.<br /><br />One of the benefits this book offers is that throughout the book there are multiple reference charts and tip sidebars that either give you information on a syntax or available options, or lead you on to find more information elsewhere.  Personally, I find the reference charts valuable as the author does not leave you guessing what all the available options or for a particular command or syntax -- in essence, he is opening the door for you to explore further on your own by showing you other possible roads.<br /><br />This is a great book for those comfortable with programming and new to Perl, or those who have used Perl in the past but perhaps wanted to see what else it could do for them.  The only thing lacking from the book is an indexing system on the side.  It would have been great if you could have just flipped the book open to the appropriate section when you are on those fast-fact-finding missions.This is a great book for those comfortable with programming and new to Perl, or those who have used Perl in the past but perhaps wanted to see what else it could do for them.

Perl is one of the easiest language for doing \\"quirk and dirty\\" tasks, such as text manipulation and writing command-line utilities for your OS of choice.  However, as any Perl programmer can tell you debugging can be a nightmare and most of rely on the old-fashioned print statement to aid most of our debugging work.  As powerful as Perl is, one of the drawbacks has always been its lack of an efficient way to debug and test the code.  Too often than not more time is spent debugging the code than actually writing the logic to do the task at hand!<br /><br />In Pro Perl Debugging, Richard Foley and Andy Lester introduce and explain the rarely-seen, often under-utilized Perl Debugger (What?  You didn't know one existed; fear not, neither did I until I read this book!).  Each chapter takes you through the steps of using the debugger and introduces various new concepts throughout.  Chapters are further subdivided into three sections that cover more broader topics such as the final section which is devoted to mainly reference and optimization of techniques learned in the previous sections.<br /><br />You will learn the concept of what the authors term fixing the bug instead of merely finding the bug.  As they point out, a lot of us pursue the task of finding a bug only to introduce other bugs as we try to pinpoint it down.  This book provides a working guide to help you migrate from the print statement and sloppy code searching into a more defined, technique driven approach using the debugger.<br /><br />The book is a great source for the experienced Perl programmer who wants to get a better handle over bug control and code debugging techniques.  I would caution beginning Perl users to get a grasp first more on the language before diving into use of the debugger as it can be complex at times.  However, seasoned Perl programmers will find a lot of the concepts and techniques given to be a great timesaver and tool for use within programs that both already exist and on the drawing board.	2005-08-14

Soon, I found myself using it for more and more situations where I needed to do a \\"quick and dirty\\" routine that could easily be ported to multiple systems.  As such, my toolbelt over the years has increased with small modules and snippets of code that I have re-used and shared with others to get out of sticky situations.  In \\"Advanced Perl Programming\\" the author shares with us his own collection of routines and such to present some of the more advanced, sometimes a bit more difficult, aspects of the language.  With Perl, the beauty is that even the most difficult processes, once written, can be re-used multiple times over.<br /><br />The book goes into detail into some of the modules available for Perl that can take a lot of grunt work out of the programming itself.  You'll learn techniques using the HTML, Parsing and RSS libraries to name a few.  Find out how to use Globs and Objects within Perl to make your programs more adaptable to emerging programming technologies.  There is even a chapter devoted to programming in and event-driven environment, something once related to mostly GUI apps but has thousands of uses in the command-line world.<br /><br />One of the best chapters for myself was the one on Unit development.  Recently, Unit Testing has been one of the more popular methodologies pushed for helping you test your code as your develop.  The author goes into detail about how to accomplish this as well as setting up automated tests within Perl itself.  Even if you have never heard of unit testing, or test-driven development as it is sometimes called, you will do yourself well to read this chapter more than once.  It can teach you some new tricks that even the oldest dogs amongst us like myself can learn from.<br /><br />A really good technique book that will help the intermediate and advanced Perl programming develop their skills and tool chest.	2005-08-11

With the explosion of broadband availability, combined with the falling prices of digital video recorders, more and more people are trying their hand at creating the new Citizen Kane right in their own homes.  Similar to the explosion that took place when digital cameras became affordable for the masses the same concept is taking hold in creating \\"talkies\\" -- or video for the masses.<br /><br />If you are like me, you have no idea how to take that video you shot last weekend of the Harley Davidson show and edit it down to remove the 15 minutes of video showing your shoes, the 10 minutes of you chasing the dog who stole your camera bag, etc., etc.  That is where \\"Digital Video Hacks\\" comes into play.  Each \\"hack\\" as it is called takes on a specific task and outlines the steps needed to produce the results.  The hacks are organized so that you can really skip throughout the book and pick up only the ones you need to know right then and now.  Many of the hacks cross-reference others, so once you figured out, for example, how to add diffusion to your camcorder light, you can easily reference that back to how to use paper lanterns or diffuse work-area light.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this book is that it doesn't focus entirely on PC-based editing as one might think from the title.  Quite a few pages are devoted to topics such as how to mount the camera to a car, how to create a green-screen environment, how to build a lightbox and more.  The author has done an excellent job of making sure you setup your environment correctly to make the editing part easier down the road.<br /><br />If you are someone who wants to take your camcorder farther and make that step from simple home-movies to presentation-style video this book is for you.  You will learn a lot of tricks and tips that the digital era of video editing has made a lot easier than the days of when you had to have tens of thousands of dollars of expensive, special-purpose equipment.  A must read for anyone who wants to know how to turn that video into the next award-winning documentary; not to mention those of us who just simply want to make better videos that don't put the entire family to sleep watching.nyone who wants to know how to turn that video into the next award-winning documentary; not to mention those of us who just simply want to make better videos that don't put the entire family to sleep watching.	2005-08-03

The author does a great job in  his layout by presenting the problem, listing the solution and then explaining how it works.  The script solutions and examples are broken down by topic and each chapter is indexed on the side of the book for easy reference by the reader.<br /><br />The book was written for those who have had some Unix/Linux experience under their belt and now want to explore some of the power of the shell itself.  Seasoned BASH shell users know that one of the most powerful aspects of the system is the ability to create applications that perform necessary tasks or functions just by using shell scripting.  This book would be ideal for anyone who wants to get more out of their system that just using the GUI-interface that has become so common.<br /><br />Most of all, it covers a lot of problems that occur everyday and that we sometime spend hours looking for a solution for.  Things such as removing excess linefeeds from a file, reformatting text, retrieving data automatically and other related tasks -- things that shell scripting excels at providing a mechanism to solve.<br /><br />Not for the beginner, but a must-have for the experienced Unix (particularly BASH shell) user.	2005-07-10

Nowadays it isn't about simply getting information about a place or location, thanks to the recent explosion of personal-GPS units, online mapping and free and low-cost satellite imagery the latest trend is to transform information into a map to present the information in a more dynamic and sometimes more usable way.<br /><br />Mapping Hacks is a unique book in that it will take you far beyond simply bringing up a map of Grandma's house.  It will show you how to take data that you collect and use it to present maps and cartographic data about everything from mapping the wi-fi hotspots in your area, to tracking a package as it moves across the globe to creating 3-D maps of your neighborhood, your city and even the entire planet.  This book is for those who aren't simply satisfied with the basic information MapQuest or Google Maps provide, but want to take that information and use it in ways that were unheard of just a few months ago.<br /><br />Though having a GPS unit to collect data is a great way to get the most out of this book, there are also plenty of hacks devoted to simply mapping out or building on top of existing data.  Perhaps you want to setup a web site that shows all the local eateries in your neighborhood along with their latest health report -- no problem, there is a hack that will walk you right through it!  This book helps open your mind to the possibilities of what all you can do with the data you already have.  You may implement the hack for the health code violations and then build from that to start mapping out housing prices, or crime statistics -- the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book does not cover the latest API into Google Maps -- one of the recent, and more popular resources for mappers.  However, the book does cover a lot of the more traditional ways of accessing sites like MapQuest and Yahoo Maps.  It was written so that you don't have to be a programmer or computer guru to get the most out of the book.<br /><br />It's a unique book (and in full color too I might add) that really will open your eyes and mind to the new ways of using services and information that once was only accessible to map makers and businesses.<br /> <br />It's a unique book (and in full color too I might add) that really will open your eyes and mind to the new ways of using services and information that once was only accessible to map makers and businesses.	2005-07-07

It has quickly become the world's largest virtual mall of just about everything you can possibly think of.  When I received this book I was eager to learn some of the \\"tricks of the trade\\" and found a lot of useful material, albeit some of it is geared towards power sellers and not the average user.<br /><br />The book itself is packed with 125 \\"hacks\\" for eBay, which can range from the basics (leaving feedback) to the more complex (setting up your own online check-out).  A lot of the hacks give you tweaks and twists on the normal way of doing things, or take a task and show you a different, sometimes a little more dynamic, way of doing it.<br /><br />Some of the more advanced topics will only be feasible if you are a powerseller.  The author covers a lot of third-party tools as well, which can quickly run into the big dollars if you are just selling a few things each week.  However, there is a fair amount of material devoted to the mom and pop sellers, like many of us are.  One of the shining points of this book is that it does show you how to do a lot of tricks yourself if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and play around with Perl.<br /><br />However, the book is for more than just sellers.  A lot of tips are there for buyers as well.  Such things as how to snipe effectively, and how to take advantage of bid increments in the auction to get the item for the lowest price.  Even though the author is writing for both parties, the buyer and seller, he does a good job of not taking advantage of one over.<br /><br />A few of the topics he covers can be a bit controversial, depending on how you look at it.  Things such as withholding feedback and sniping can be frowned upon by some -- but it is all perfectly legal in the world of eBay and the author tells you how to take advantage of it.<br /><br />Overall, a good book for those who want to get more out of eBay than just the casual buyer/seller.  If you want to kick-start your eBay selling career, this is one of the books you will want to have to help guide you; Whereas if you want to learn the tricks of the buying game, you couldn't have picked a better reference manual.he casual buyer/seller.

Most C# and VB.Net programmers know there are many quirks and unforseen results that hide within the .NET Framework.  Sometimes we think we know how something should behave, and will spend hours trying to make it work -- all the while, the actual behavior was working correctly, it was our assumptions that were incorrect.<br /><br />In this book, the author takes you through 75 of the most common quirks, gotchas and pitfalls that even the most experienced .NET programmer sometimes will get stuck up on.  This is not a book about errors within .NET, rather one that shows you the more common differences between perceived and expected results.<br /><br />The book is organized into sections covering different areas of the framework -- from the CLR itself, to garbage collection, to the Visual Studio environment, and beyond.  One of the more helpful parts about the book is the author in many places will illustrate code snippets with \\"gotcha\\" or incorrect code, and then have a sample of the correct way to code a given item to get back the intended results.  In addition, a wrap-up at the end of each gotcha puts the entire thing into a nutshell-quote to make it (hopefully) easy to remember and apply.<br /><br />To wrap it all up, the author also includes a pretty comprehensive appendix to direct to you to web sites, online discussion groups and FAQ's to find out more information about the particular quirk or gotcha.<br /><br />All in all, one of those books you won't just purchase and sit down and read for the heck of it.  Rather, one of the books you purchase and yank off the shelf when you find yourself doing some .NET programming and find yourself scratching your head trying to avoid a pitfall.	2005-06-05

Microsoft has delivered by Visual C# 2005 which will be released with the upcoming Visual Studio 2005.  In \\"Visual C# 2005 - A Developer's Notebook\\" the author has done a wonderful job of taking you through the new features of the language and showing you \\"what you need to know to get it done\\" about this new release.<br /><br />Before you purchase this book, realize it is not a C# primer nor beginner's guide.  This book was written for those who already are familiar and use C#.  A lot of what the author goes into will make no sense unless you already have a firm understanding of the language and are familiar with its constructs.<br /><br />For those of you who are familiar with the language, you are in for a terrific reference guide to the new features.  The author has taken each new feature, such as Accessing Objects in the Global Namespace, and tells you how you do it programatically (with source code), explains what you just did, and gives an explanation about other uses or \\"gotchas\\" that might result by using this feature.  To conclude, he gives a reference to another source so that if you want to learn more, or go farther in-depth, you can easily find out more -- most often by pointing back to the MSDN developer library.<br /><br />Often, when there is a point the author wishes to bring you attention to, he uses the sidebar to draw your attention.  A quick blurb about a special syntax or argument that could shed a lot of light on some of the new concepts.<br /><br />Overall, a great companion to the upcoming Visual Studio 2005 C# release.  If you are an experienced C# programmer and want to know what is ahead -- this would be well worth adding to your bookshelf.	2005-05-05

Whereas Linux was once resolved to be an OS for pure hobbyists and those who wanted to \\"escape from Redmond\\", it now sits side-by-side with Microsoft Windows in many corporations and homes.  The goal therefore of the new O'Reilly book \\"Linux In A Windows World\\" is to show how to get the two operating systems on speaking terms with each other.<br /><br />What is the most common thing people do on any OS?  You got it -- print!  Yet, time and time again, we have seen that even the simplest thing such as printing a document can be a nightmare when you have two different operating systems competing for the same printer.  This is just a small real-life example of the type of task you will find while reading this book.  You will be taken through the steps to get your Linux system working happily with that Windows printer down in Accounting.<br /><br />Throughout the book the author does an excellent job of tackling a common system administrator task, such as using Active Directory (Windows Domains) for authenticating users on the Linux boxes.  Not only does he cover the most common ways of doing the task, but he also goes into detail about alternative methods and \\"extras\\" that your system might need depending on your environment.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed most of all in this book is the author does not favor one OS over the other.  When the task is appropriate, or easier, on either Windows or Linux, he outlines how to do it and make the other OS utilize that service or feature on the host OS.  This is where many other books fall short, in that they try and convince you that everything must be done under one or OS versus the other instead of just laying out the map and letting the users see which is the best choice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great reference work for any system administrator facing the challenge of having a mixed Windows and Linux environment.  Although it doesn't cover all the possibilities that could exist, it will cover the most common tasks as well as hitting up on one of the most important -- security.  Well worth the price for the number of gray hairs you will save in accomplishing some of these tasks in your mixed environment.ies that could exist, it will cover the most common tasks as well as hitting up on one of the most important -- security.

Unfortunately, out of the shrink-wrap XP doesn't offer much in the way of tweaks, nor does it fully expose the power that lays underneath its graphical interface.  In this revised Windows XP Hacks book from O'Reilly, you will find a wealth of information on how to tune and trick-out Windows XP (with and without SP2) and take the OS to new levels of power and performance.<br /><br />The book is organized by category, such as Networking and System Peformance, and then broken down into individual \\"hacks\\" as they are called that guide you through tweaking a specific component.  Often, the hacks cross-reference each other so if you are interested in doing one thing, you can easily find related topics to that change or tweak.  In traditional O'Reilly fashion, each hack is also prefaced with a difficulty ranking -- so you can start out tackling the easy stuff and move up the ladder as you feel more comfortable.<br /><br />The author does a good job of covering the new features, and significant changes, to Windows XP Service Pack 2.  Although some may think of SP2 as merely a minor release, there are many things that have changed since the first edition of this book and they are all covered in detailed throughout the book.  In addition, the author also provides a good background on each topic covered -- so you know exactly what the hack does, and why you might want to apply it.<br /><br />The book is geared towards the more advanced user in mind; be warned upfront that in many places you will be asked to edit the system registry directly.  However, as stated above, a difficult level will help guide novice users through some of the easier changes they can make.  It is still worthwhile to note though that a new computer user, or one with limited comfort going \\"under the hood\\" may find this book more than they wish to swallow.<br /><br />The only drawback to the book is the author does have a very slight occassional habit of getting off-track about Windows XP.  In several hacks, she devotes quite a few pages to talking about Firefox and other items that are unrelated to the XP Operating System itself.  However, some readers may find this beneficial and look at it as a way to extend the OS; while those not interested can simply skip over the hack.<br /><br />Altogether, a good book that provides the blueprint for tweaking and changing Windows XP to your liking.

In this way, a reader who is familiar with any of these languages can catch on and understand what is happening without having to learn yet another syntax just to understand the basics of regular expressions.<br /><br />The book itself is categorized into different topics with an index system that makes it easy to jump to right what you are most interested in.  When the author covers a topic, such as Reformatting Last Names, he also cross-references other useful, related regular expressions that the reader may also have an interest in given the topic.<br /><br />Of particular interest to those new to the Regular Expression field, the author does a good job of explaining in everyday terms how an expression works.  One of the drawbacks of many RegEx books is that often you cannot grasp exactly why a certain syntax works because of the complexity of the problem.<br /><br />The only lacking spot in this book is that it does not include any \\"real\\" output of running the regular expressions; however given the content and ease-of-use of the book, this is but a small caveat that should not impact most readers.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful reference that explains Regular Expressions in terms that most beginning and intermediate users will enjoy and learn from.	2005-01-02

Similar to a checklist, you will find yourself going through this book using it as a guideline as you rollout your Server 2003 installations and double-checking existing ones already live.<br /><br />The author does a great job of focusing on the task at hand, security, and does not try to do what so many others have -- make this an entire book about implementing 2003.  By keeping to the point, the book itself becomes a desk reference instead of another bookshelf weight.  Many of the tasks focused on in the book can be bookmarked and refered to for case scenarios during any 2003 implementation.<br /><br />From understanding the basic security of a Server 2003 system, implementing Group Policy Objects, all the way up to understanding Kerbos and PKI cryptography, this book covers each topic in enough detail to give the reader a firm ground on which to check and implement procedures.<br /><br />One of the strong features of the book is the author actually walks you through many of the steps you need to take -- with screenshots where appropriate.  He does not leave you stranded in the middle of a procedure with only a vague mention of what task to perform next.  Experienced administrators will appreciate the fact that he goes into detail to cover all the bases while newer administrators will appreciate the hands-on approach and step-by-step instructions.<br /><br />Overall, a great security book that should become a standard on any System Administrators bookshelf.  Server 2003 has introduced a new era into the Microsoft Server family, one which not all the old tricks and practices of Windows 2000 apply -- this book will help you learn the new ropes and get up to speed quickly.	2004-12-22

A lot of books on the market take you through the inner-workings of Windows, Linux, [insert favorite OS here].  However, there are very few out there that go deep inside the PC itself and get down to the hardware level.  In \\"PC Hacks\\", the author takes us inside the PC to look at what can be done at the hardware level to tweak system performance and stability.<br /><br />First off, this book is not for the novice user.  If you are not willing to \\"risk a little\\" then you should not attempt the hacks set forth in the book.  Many of them, if not performed precisely, can cause serious damage to your system -- some could even cause permanent hardware damage (such as overclocking your CPU).  However, for those who are brave -- the rewards and adventure that await are well worth it.<br /><br />Covering topics such as upgrading your power supply, changing CPU voltage (overclocking), moving and changing disk partitions, even overclocking your video card (that was even a new one for me!) will have most dedicated PC geek up to all hours trying out different settings and tweaks.<br /><br />Even if you aren't ready to start messing with the voltage, the book provides a good handbook on topics such as \\"Why should I worry if my paging (virtual memory) file is fragmented?\\" and \\"Do I need to upgrade by BIOS?\\" that even middle-of-the-road users might fight well worth reading up on.  There are a number of items that the author talks about that are merely informational, but could really come in handy the next time your system decides to stop functioning the moment you need it to the most.<br /><br />For those \\"old timers\\" out there, this book comes close to the old Norton books of the mid 1980's that explained what went on under the hood of early PC's.  For the younger users, it is a terrific way to explore the true \\"hobbyist\\" side of computing and tweaking a system much like a car enthusiast tunes his engine.	2004-12-21

The perfect shot consists of a number of factors including subject, background, angle, lighting, lense and exposure.  Granted, digital cameras let us perfect the formula almost immediately, and that is where this book comes into play.<br />One would argue that the book could be used by both a digital photographer and a traditional film photographer.  The author described techniques that could really be applied to any photographer regardless of camera type -- for instance, how to mount a camera to get the perfect \\"stable\\" image at the correct angle.  Many of the tips focus on the technique behind photography and how to set-up the perfect shot -- all before you hit the button.<br />Overall, the book provides a good reference for the hobbyist who does not have the mega-expensive camera or setup.  The author shows how to take pictures that rival many professionals without spending a fortune.  I learnt a lot about when to use a flash, and when to use diffused lighting -- again, something that could be carried over to the traditional film world.  By just applying these tips I immediately noticed that pictures I took indoors took on a new life; and looked a whole lot better.<br />If you are looking for a book that strictly focuses on digital cameras and how to hack them, this book is not for you.  If you are one of the hundreds of thousands of 'new' hobbyist photographers that the digital camera revolution has created and want to improve your technique and your shots then this book is a terrific resource manual to learn the tricks of the trade.	2004-05-19

This is a good book for system administrators who utilize WMI on a daily basis to help automate tasks.  The author does a decent job of explaining how to incorporate WMI into VBScript to retrieve information from the WMI about the local computer to aid in tasks such as hardware management, application management and other inventory/asset tasks that a sysadmin would be faced with on a daily basis.<br />However, if you are looking for a pure WMI reference, this book falls far short.  It does not cover many of the classes available in WMI, and outside of VBScript provides no other access methods for WMI (any there are tons).  The author basically misses the power of WMI by focusing on single tasks that can be in a one-off approach instead of looking of WMI as a whole and seeing its power in management across a large network or Enterprise.<br />A good book for the one-off tasks that normally would take quite a bit of time; a not-so-good book for the programmer wanting to get into a deep understanding of WMI.	2004-05-07

How many times have you been typing in a command and forgot the options available?<br />Through this book, the author has taken many of the substaintial commands for users, admins, networking and programming and rolled them into a dictionary of sort for Linux users.<br />Sure, you can find out a lot about any command through the online man pages, but the author has taken the somewhat cryptic man pages and broken them down into simple, to the point, references laid out much like you would expect to find in a dictionary.<br />In addition, you'll find handy reference manuals for common utilities, such as emacs, vi, CVS, sed and awk.  While each of these could fill a book in themselves, the author has broken them down to the bare basics to help you get up and running and understand basic operation of each.<br />All in all, a wonderful reference manual that will compliment more in-depth manuals on actual use and administration of a Linux system.	2004-05-07

Security Warrior presents a unique approach in that it not only explains the traps, but also goes in depth on how these traps and exploits actually work.<br />The author presents each chapter with information about specific exploits, then goes into the actual exploits themselves.  The book is geared towards the security professional, and novice users could find the amount of information that is presented overwhelming and confusing.  At the end of each chapter is a resource section that invites the read to continue learning about a particular pitfall by providing more books and online sources for information.<br />One of the caveats of this book is the fact that in the wrong hands it can actually be used against the very systems the author wanted to defend.  The amount of technical detail is so great, that a skilled hacker or cracker could take this book and use it as a resource in his toolkit.  It is the classic situation of you can't fix the problem without knowing what the problem is.<br />Don't pick up this book if you want an overview of general computer security; you will be lost in the information overload.  Do pick this book up if you are a security administrator or systems administrator and want to take a proactive approach in securing your systems against attack.	2004-05-02

They are powerful ways to search, manipulate and parse text fields and can often take several lines of code and shrink it down to a mystic, but powerful, expression.<br />If you have ever had to parse a file for information, you know that one of the things that still haunts any programmer nowadays is how to match text.  In this day and age of Object Oriented Programming, Web Services, etc. the power of Regex holds firm.<br />Throughout this book the author takes great care not to overwhelm the reader with tons of code that has no meaning.  The power of the book comes from the fact that if you read, and follow along, through the examples you will gain an understanding of how to do the techniques the author is referring to.  At times it may seem like you have to read over a section twice, but you will realize that as you carry forth into the next section the material you read previously has turned into something you can now apply -- not just another example you can cut and paste and never really learn technique behind.<br />This is a powerful book, covering many, many pages.  Noone should expect to sit down and read it cover to cover and be done with it.  The benefit comes from reading, applying, and referencing.  I find myself using it several times a week to lookup information on Regular Expressions and to held solidify knowledge of techniques that I have used in the past.<br />Whether you are a Windows, Unix, or even Macintosh person -- RegEx holds the key to text manipulation -- and this book holds the map you need to find that key.	2004-04-30

The author dives into not only the simple hacks, such as disabling autoplay or speeding up the appearance of menus and changing display properties, but also goes into the Registry to show you tweaks for advanced items such as changing the memory used for I/O operations, and protecting file type associations from changing.<br />Though the book does have a habit of jumping around a bit, and there is no real clear organization of the topics, it is a good reference for those who really want to get into the OS itself and remove some of the &quot;annoying&quot; things (like the cute themes Microsoft has decided to push upon us).  It's also a great reference for those who are attempting to setup home networks, or login to their computer remotely -- the author does more than tweak, he explains about these features that might otherwise be overlooked.<br />Overall, the book is a good buy for the advanced computer user.  Beginners and casual users might be better off utilizing less powerful resources as this book can overwhelm if you do not understand the technical details of Windows XP.	2004-04-30

It is basically a &quot;hold my hand&quot; step-by-step approach to installing, configuring and using Fedora RedHat Linux.<br />The first part of the book deals with the installation and configuring of the Linux system.  The author has went to great lengths to &quot;keep it simple&quot; and not overwhelm the average user.  This approach does over-simplify a few tasks, and leaves a few more advanced topics out, but it well suited for the intended audience.<br />In the majority of the book you'll learn how to use the most common home-user applications on a Linux system:  Playing Musical CD's, composing documents, printing, burning CD's, editing graphic files, etc.  The book comes with plenty of screenshots to walk even the most novice user through accomplishing these tasks on Linux systems.<br />The only drawback to this book is that there is almost zero command-line coverage.  While it's true, even in the Windows world, the average home user doesn't have to drop to the command line, there are simply some tasks in Linux that are best suited for the command line and the author could have saved many pages by simply guiding the user to this instead of attemping to do it in a graphical environment.<br />Overall, the book is a great resource for home users who want to experiment and take the plunge over to Linux.  The book comes with a 2-CD set that contains a version of Linux Based on RedHat Fedora, plus a CD that contains many programs geared towards the novice home user.<br />A great gift idea; and a good resource for those just coming into the Linux scene.	2004-04-12

Through this book, the author takes us on an informative and entertaining journey into the world of retail marketing.  However, the beauty of the book lies is that while it is a must-read for any retailer, it will appeal and intrigue the average consumer.<br />When you shop, you aren't just shopping -- you are performing a science.  From the way you move your eyes, to what path you take through the store, even items you touch on the shelves, is all part of how each individual consumer makes a purchasing choice.  Through this book, you learn how retailers have studied shoppers -- like yourself -- and why certain items are on the top shelfs, why two items are never on sale at the same time, and a wealth of other retail secrets.<br />Have you ever stopped to think about what happens the moment you walk into the store?  Probably not, but you'll learn about what happens from the parking lot to the checkout stand in this book.  You'll find out, for example, why shopping carts are usually always on the righthand side, and why the days of plastering windows with advertisements are all but over for many stores.<br />Overall, this book is just fascinating in the depth of knowledge it presents, and in such a manner to make it entertaining and informative.  Even the most casual reader can find something of interest.<br />One thing is for sure, once you read this book, you'll never view a grocery store or mall the same way again.	2004-04-12

For years, any system administrator running Linux who was worth his paycheck knew that Qmail was the defacto standard for running a mail server (heck, even Yahoo uses it!).  Sendmail has always been ripe with security holes and headaches -- something Qmail has went to great lengths to correct.  However, the problem has always been there was no easy reference guide to Qmail.  You had to be either a Linux-geek, or know someone who was, to get it installed and working correctly!<br />Now, thanks to O'Reilly, even us non-geeks can get our Qmail systems up and running in no time.  This book covers everything you need to know in an easy-to-follow format.  From installation, to making the switch from sendmail, even how to tune and setup third-party components with Qmail to help control spam, scan for viruses and run your own mailing list server.<br />One of the great things about this book is it, for the most part, is not dependent on any particular flavor of Linux.  The author does a good job of making it generic enough that you can follow along no matter what distribution you use.<br />Granted, you will need to know a bit about Linux to use read and fully understand this book.  It is geared towards system admistrators and not the end-user of a Qmail system.  However, you don't need to be a Linux Guru to understand it -- it has just enough detail to satisfy without overwhelming.<br />Overall, this is the handbook for Qmail that has been long overdue -- a one-stop technical manual that puts the final touch on Qmail.	2004-04-11

The authors do a good job of covering aspects of Windows Form programming, including showing you how to design and implement some advanced features that you won't find in any online documentation for C# or .Net.  The authors even walk you through several sample applications to show you &quot;hands on&quot; programing with the controls.<br />Unfortunately, they don't cover all of the Windows Forms controls, and leave out a few of the basics.  However, the ones they have left out seem to be the more basic controls that don't require a lot of advanced explanation.<br />Overall, this book is good material for your bookshelf for those times when you need to verify, or learn, how a control works.

So therefore when I saw the \\"MAC OS X HACKS\\" book I immediately grabbed a copy.  Having just finished \\"Google Hacks\\", another O'Reilly publication, I was eager to dive in and see if this book would be as useful as the Google book.  I would not be disappointed. One of the unique aspects of this book is you can turn to any \\"hack\\" and begin applying it without having to read the others.  The book is like a collection of many magazine articles brought together under one roof - and with all the media fluff removed.  I was amazed at how a novice like me could easily follow the step-by-step instructions and not feel lost.  I soon found myself using color-coded paperclips to mark off sections of the book for future reference in terms of what they did (OS setting, audio settings, etc.). You can dive right into some of the more advanced hacks, such as setting up your own mail server, without having to worry that the authors will assume you are familiar with how to do a particular step.  They walk you through the entire process; complete with screen shots for some of the more tricky options, and let you focus on the task at hand.<br />Considering how much benefit this novice MAC OS X user got from the book, more advanced Macintosh users are likely to find that this book provides a quick \\"easy reference\\" for some of the more tricky or complicated setups.  Since the book is organized into independent sections, one could easily use this for a desktop reference.  Plus, it's not the \\"Macintosh for Dummies\\" type of book that seems to fill most shelves nowadays - the authors assume you want to do the advanced stuff with OS X, but just need some tips to get you going. Hopefully O'Reilly will continue with the \\"Hacks\\" series of books (I'm eagerly awaiting a book on Windows Hacks!); they are the first series of books that really let the end users get under the hood of various platforms and tasks and \\"get the job done\\" without feeling lost.  I would not be surprised to see MAC OS X Hacks, as well as other Hacks books, come out in volume format.  After all, after spending almost a week with the MAC OS X book, I can see how these can quickly expand to cover a lot more topics in a similar, condensed format - which for us \\"get it done now\\" type people is a godsend!nd \\"get the job done\\" without feeling lost.
