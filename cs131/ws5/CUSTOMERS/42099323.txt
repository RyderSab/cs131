Tessa from the future is pulled back into time to fulfill a density which is to free the barbed coil from its slavery under Izgard of Garizon. My only complaint about this book is the length. She could have cut out about 100 pages here or there and it would have held together even better. But I will definitely read The Book of Words series eventually when I get to it.	2004-05-04

Ed Greenwood writes good fantasy but this series but his spell battles are way to confusing.

The few one-star reviewers made NO SENSE. Calling Elminster a wuss. Excuse me he is only a kid. Actually pretty strong kid after seeing his parents murdered right in front of his eyes. Then they say there is nudity. I have read about nudity in some of Lackey's books and this is G-rated. I love the progression of the book just like in a PC generated D&D game which divided up each part of the book While I read the book I saw no typos and Greenwood did a great story. The fact is that there was not enough history and not to much. But I look forward to the rest of the series with great excitement. The only critical thing I have to say about the series is the fact that the order of the books are kinda of confusing. I will list what I think is the correct order: <BR>1. Elminster: The Making of the Mage.<BR>2. Elminster in Myth Drannor <BR>3. The Temptation of Elminster<BR>4. Elminster in Hell<BR>5. Upcoming Elminster's Daughter.<br />I hope everyone will enjoy this great series.	2004-02-25

This story which was an in-between for me after I finished Haydon's Rhapsody trilogy and before I started Greenwood's Elminster series was quite a thrill ride.

Haydon has just started writing fantasy which by the way she does a great job in doing. I like the character building the best from the interactions of Achmed, Rhapsody, and Grunthor, I could not put down this book and felt bad when I had to go through finals and couldn't read it for more than a two weeks. Some parts did drag but every author let's say Robert Jordan did for sure drag but at least she ends it with a chilling cliff hanger which continues in Prophecy. So please people read the book before judging it. I did and found it to be a great piece of fantasy that I will keep on my many shelves in my home.	2003-12-25

This story fills in a lot of story line with Icewind Dale. I have always been interested in Icewind Dale since I played the first Icewind Dale game for the PC. Even though I know the history of Icewind Dale PC game doesn't have anything to do with the series that Salvatore made it did help expand that world.	2002-11-26

From the evil Knights which I thought were the perfect opposite of the Knights of Order in every way to the Palin who was a powerful mage in the making. Weis and Hickman's best ever book.	2002-09-22
