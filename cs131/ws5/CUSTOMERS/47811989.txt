They're all suitable for children's wrists in length, a little over five inches. My cousins (six and seven years old) adore them. Like all Dover books, they're a nice treat for No-Special-Occasions.	2001-02-01

Perfect for Halloween, or all year long, these critters are realistic enough to startle the unwary. Other bugs depicted are the bumblebee, the elephant stag beetle, a potato bug, a grasshopper, a willow leaf beetle, a rose weevil, a violet tail, a Mormon cricket, a wasp, a harlequin bug, and a tiger beetle.	2001-02-01

This one has ten designs, dinosaurs and prehistoric reptiles. My favorite is the tiger-striped Kronosaurus, a marine reptile. There's no accompanying information on the creatures, but the pictures and the price more than make up for it, and sparked my cousins into learning more about them on their own. I got a copy of these tattoos for myself, too. The depictions include Triceratops, Quetzalcoatlus (a flyer), Spinosaurus, Iguanodon, Ornithomimus, Polacanthus, Deinonychus, and the popular Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.	2001-02-01

They're all quite colorful, and some of them appeal, but none of them seem especially interesting. My cousins (ages six and seven, female) passed it back and forth for a couple of weeks, and I don't know that they ever did use them all. The designs seem too ugly for girls (I know, they're gargoyles, they're supposed to be ugly, but there are limits) and perhaps are too colorful for boys, but that's only a guess. ... I don't know that I would say don't buy it, but I probably wouldn't put it at the top of the list, either.	2001-02-01
