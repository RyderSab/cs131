(So you don't want to start the series with this book.)  The teenager Kevin (Joanne's former owner back from when she was a Djinn) now has control of the most powerful Djinn in the world, and has effectively taken over Las Vegas and is keeping all Wardens out of the city.  The story begins with the Wardens taking possession of David, Joanne's Djinn lover, and sending her to Las Vegas as bait in a last ditch effort to save the world.  In the meantime, all Joanne needs to do is survive the machinations of her fellow Wardens, Djinn with unfathomable agendas and the shadowy underground fellowship of Ma'at, keepers of the balance and enemies of the Wardens.  The story ends on a bit of a cliffhanger concerning David, but the Kevin storyline appears to be wrapped up, and I will definitely be reading the next book in the series.	2005-09-28

After finding out that Bill hasn't exactly been the most faithful puppy of the bunch, Sookie nevertheless decides to rescue him with the help of Eric, Bill's sexy vampire boss, and Alcide, a werewolf who has an eye for her.  Action and romantic thrills abound, although I would hesitate at describing this as a mystery, since it's a haphazard one at best (the story is mostly just about Sookie hunting Bill down, so to speak).  The ending is unresolved (in that the mystery of the book is solved but the reader is left to wonder about Sookie's relationships with her men).  Sookie is as charming as ever, and I definitely plan to read the next book in the series.	2003-05-01

Susan Callaway, the self-described fat girl, is an engaging and interesting narrator who is struggling with her mother's death and her alienation at school, and trying to mend her relationships with her father and brother.  If you liked The Misfits by James Howe, and pretty much anything by Chris Crutcher, then check this book out.	2003-05-01

Anita finally has some measure of control over the ardeur, which again plays a fairly major role in the movement of the plot, and she and her guys (pretty much all of them) interact in various ways (violently, sexually, emotionally, and otherwise), which has always been interesting.  A secondary subplot features a gruesome werewolf serial killer, an international terrorist, and an assassin who all want Anita to raise a certain someone for them.  I find that the mystery sections and the sex/romance/paranormal relationship segments have become less and less integrated as the series has come along.  They can pretty much be read as separate but unequal stories.  However, if you like paranormal romance, this is definitely a series to read, as it is much more interesting and imaginative than a lot of others out there.  And as always, it's entertaining and a lot of fun.	2003-04-02

Angelica is the story (briefly mentioned in Archangel) of Susannah, an Edori woman, who is taken away from her family and friends to be the bride of Gaaron, the archangel-elect.  Samaria faces a threat from strangers who appear and disappear suddenly, leaving death and scorched destruction in their wake.  Susannah has a crucial role to play in Samarias protection; she has had strange dreams about a disembodied voice and a room full of metal and light since she was a child.<br />Angelica is also the story of Gaarons younger sister Miriam, who runs away to join Susannahs Edori clan and discovers friendship and love with one of the enemy strangers who is wounded during an attack on the camp.  The romantic development between Susannah and Gaaron is slow and steady; I found Miriam and Jossiss romance to be more interesting and wished it had been developed more.	2003-03-07

Dealing with the darker aspects of childhood, including abuse and alienation, the stories and poetry are full of depth and transformation; magic, despair, and ultimately hope.  Some exceptional stories are \\"The Armless Maiden\\" by Midori Snyder, \\"The Juniper Tree\\" by Peter Straub, \\"The Lion and the Lark\\" by Patricia McKillip, \\"The Lily and the Weaver's Heart\\" by Nancy Etchemendy, \\"In the House of My Enemy\\" by Charles De Lint, and \\"In the Night Country\\" by Ellen Steiber.

This book explores the creative ways Gypsum chooses to use her power among her close-knit family, with help from a mysterious girl named Altria.

Written by the monk Gunther of Pairis, it tells of the sacking of Greek Orthodox Constantinople by the Roman Catholic crusaders, casting the abbot Martin of Pairis as a hero.

All of these have been around for decades, but I just read them for the first time last year, as a sophomore in college, because I avoided &quot;classics&quot; like the plague while growing up.<br />The Black Cauldron is the darkest of the Prydain Chronicles, and it tells the story of Taran and his companions as they head to Arawn Death-Lord's domain to recover the Black Cochran, which creates soldiers out of the dead.  The book explores the price  and sacrifice that true heroism demands.  The memorable cast of characters include Adaon, a unique bard, and three interchangeable witches who are reminiscent of the Three Norns, or the Fates.<br />A haunting and beautiful tale that I highly recommend (along with all the Prydain Chronicles).	2001-05-26

One of the main suspects in her investigation is Roarke, a darkly seductive Irish billionaire who seems to own just about everything in the free world.  I'm not generally a fan of Nora Roberts' mainstream romance books, and I read _Naked in Death_ because I was intrigued by the idea of a female homicide detective working in a futuristic atmosphere.  This book has both gritty mystery and very satisfying romance-I think both mystery and romance fans won't be disappointed-and both Eve and Roarke are memorable characters.	2000-12-06

Someone has hired a hit on Anita, who's being &quot;wooed&quot; by the two men in her life: Richard, who happens to be a werewolf, and Jean-Claude, who is a vampire(Master Vampire of St. Louis, in fact).  Both shapeshifters and vampires play a major part in this exciting, adventurous, thrilling book, and this is one of my favorites in the series.  I would recommend that you read the other books first, starting with _Guilty Pleasures_.	2000-12-06

But it is a wonderful, enchanting tale.  Anne Shirley is a quirky, energetic, imaginative(and talkative) heroine, never afraid to say exactly what she thinks.  She's the kind of girl I would like to be(or at least I would want a best friend like her), and her relationships with all the characters of Avonlea are utterly charming, and I would recommend this book for all ages.	2000-12-06

Anita Blake is an animator who makes a living raising the dead.  In this book, Anita is drawn into the vampire politics of St. Louis when new vampires come to town and want her for a human servant.  Anita is a clever, humorous, tough heroine, and I highly recommend this book.	2000-12-06

I have to say first that Anita is one of the coolest heroines I've ever &quot;met.&quot;  She's tough, savvy, resourceful, brave, and compassionate, and she knows how to get dirty jobs done when no one else will do them.  This book involves interesting character development on Jean-Claude's part, and a lot of cool evil vampires, as Anita travels to Branson, Missouri from St. Louis to investigate some strange (possibly vampiric) murders.	2000-12-06

In a penal colony modeled after Toronto, Canada, after an epidemic of serial murders called The Killing Times, Jaguar uses empathic skills to find the root of criminals' fears.  This time she must use a virtual simulation of Heaven in order to find the source of a female cult leader's fear before the dispersed cult tries to bring about an apocalypse through particularly frightening methods.  There is plenty of character development and a great plot, and I definitely recommend this and the other two books in the series.	2000-12-06

It introduces readers to the werewolf pack that Richard belongs to, when Anita is called on to help them discover who has been killing shapeshifters.  Jean-Claude, Master Vampire of St. Louis, also plays a part, as he happens to have an interest in Anita and the local werewolf pack.  A very cool book that I highly recommend.	2000-12-06

Jaguar works on Planetoid Three, a penal colony modeled after Toronto.  She uses unorthodox methods(namely empathic skills) to find the root of criminals' fears.  In this book, she is sent to Earth on forced leave where she must work as a visiting professor for the cultural studies department in a New York State University.  She discovers that there is a Telekine, a particularly lethal mind power, somewhere on campus, and that her simple &quot;probation&quot; job is actually tangled up with the deadly politics of the military and university.	2000-12-06

But if you, like me, love the rest of the gang more, then you'll find yourself sorely missing them, as they are absent in this book.  The mystery aspect of the book is rather unmemorable, but there are new characters, and the majority of the book was really character development(and signs of burn-out in Anita). I recommend the entire series, starting with Guilty Pleasures, but new readers should definitely read this one after the other eight to really have a feel for the characters.	2000-12-06

This is the book I secretly dub &quot;the Richard book,&quot; because it takes place in Tennessee instead of Missouri, and its main focus is the werewolves.  Anita heads over to Tennessee to rescue her ex-fiance Richard, who has gotten himself into a bit of trouble.  Lots of shapeshifting and continuing character development goes on, so I would recommend that new readers read the other books first.	2000-12-06

Members of the vampire council have come to St. Louis from France, and Anita and the gang have some territory and dominance problems.  The mystery was overshadowed by the further character development and new developments in Anita's arsenal of power.  As always, the supporting characters are seductive, charming, endearing, and generally wonderful, and Asher is a great tortured anti-hero-type character.  Read the other books first, though.	2000-12-06

Anita is probably my favorite heroine-she's funny and clever, courageous and resourceful.  She is a layered and interesting character, and her interactions with the supporting characters in this book(and all the books after this) are wonderful.  Jean-Claude is a fabulously dark and charismatic vampire, with an appealing, enigmatic wickedness.  Very highly recommended.	2000-12-05

Keely, a head-strong and defiant princess with shape-changing powers, struggles between wanting to fulfill the prophecy of the Lion and not wanting to marry the man she is betrothed to.
