US	52836712	R2YL90VWXZFJ9K	0786017112	52908973	The Home	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Strange goings on at the Wendover home	Life has not been easy for young Freeman Mills. As a child, the twelve year old was tortured by his now absent father, ostensibly in the name of science. Although not charged with any crime by the authorities, the youth believes he is responsible for his mother's death. Finally, the boy's been shunted from one childcare facility to another, finding each successive home more miserable than its predecessor.<br /><br />As the novel begins, Freeman has been transferred to Wendover Home, a facility run by obsessive born again Christian Francis Bondurant and deranged physician Dr. Krackowski. Krackowski treats the residents of the home as his personal stable of guinea pigs in the misguided experiments he conducts in the ominously numbered Room 13.  These experiments, which result in the temporary clinical death of his subjects, have two side effects. One is that the test subjects develop psychic powers. The other, far more dangerous side effect is that the machinery used to conduct the experiments seems to be stirring up the spirits of the tortured and angry souls who have died within the confines of Wendover over the decades. A gifted psychic before being subjected to Krackowski's demented experiments, Freeman quickly realizes that things are coming to a head in Wendover; he seeks to escape before he joins the legion of the damned trapped inside the home.<br /><br />Nicholson has come a long way since his first novel, The Red Church, shedding many of the annoying habits and quirks which marred that book. A focused, tightly written work, The Home successfully combines tropes of science fiction and horror to produce an effective work of suspense. Although the villains of the piece sometimes go a little over the top, and Nicholson takes his sweet time letting the tension build, none of this interferes too badly with the novel's overall forward momentum--in the end, The Home proves itself a quick, satisfying, scary read.	2005-10-07

Having found new hope from her long distance relationship with Kenzie Mullroy, she tackles the sad task of going through the boxes of Christine's personal items that she had stored away.  Much to her dismay, she discovers a gun amidst Christine's keepsakes which had been deemed a key piece of evidence in a notorious murder trial some eighteen years before.  Desperate to know what Christine's involvement in that case was, she undertakes a private investigation into a sensational triple murder which has generated controversy locally and nationally for nearly two decades.<br /><br />Although this was my first Jane Lawless book (The Iron Girl is the thirteenth book in the series which began in 1989 with Hallowed Murder), I felt as if I had been reading about her for ages.  Falling under Hart's spell within a few pages, I took an immediate interest in Jane and her extended family, and in the small corner of Minnesota where The Iron Girl is set.  Hart lays her cards on the table with great patience, stringing her readers along with an intoxicating mixture of danger, humor and romance, keeping them riveted until she can deliver her jolting and satisfying conclusion.  They say you'll always remember your first, and that's definitely true for me in the case of Jane Lawless, Ellen Hart and The Iron Girl.	2005-10-07

Unlike the former, which featured a demonic car out for blood, the latter features something that looks like an auto, but is actually a doorway to another reality.<br /><br />The aforementioned doorway takes the approximate shape of a Buick Roadmaster; said car was impounded by a unit of the Pennsylvania state police in 1979, after its owner, a tall man dressed in black, abandons it at a local gas station.  Examining the vehicle, the responding officers realize that it contains far too many anomalies to actually be a car.  Intrigued by its utter strangeness, they tow it back to their barracks, where it becomes a source of wonderment to them for the next two decades.<br /><br />Why?  Well, strange things happen around the Buick, which is kept in a storage shed on the grounds.  The first night it is there, the temperature in the shed drops twenty degrees.  Then, the car begins to emit intense bursts of light.  Finally, a trooper disappears-subsequent investigation leads the troop to conclude that, strange as it may seem, the car was somehow responsible.<br /><br />Over the years, any number of strange plants and creatures appear in the shed, seemingly emerging from its trunk.  Objects placed in the shed for experimental purposes disappear.  The light shows continue, but are separated by greater and greater intervals.  During this time, the troop manages to keep the car a secret, revealing its presence and activities to only a select few.<br /><br />The troopers relate the Buick's history over the course of an evening to young Ned Wilcox, son of Curtis Wilcox, a trooper who died a year earlier in an accident eerily similar to the one that befell King in 1999 (even eerier, King wrote the novel before his accident).  Curtis was obsessed with the car, studying and recording its activities, even going so far as to autopsy one of the creatures that emerged from its \\"womb.\\"  Despite this, he never finds definitive answers.<br /><br />If From a Buick 8 is \\"about\\" something, it is about the fact that life itself rarely yields definitive answers.  As one character says, \\"Life rarely finishes its conversations.\\"  Why do some people survive accidents when others perish?  Why are some successful and others failures?  Why?  Real life is not orderly, nor is everything which occurs easily explainable.  Human beings can look for patterns, for explanations, but they very rarely manifest themselves.  The book also makes the point that, despite the tragedy or wonderment that appears in our lives, life, indeed, does go on.  King's characters go to great pains to emphasize that to Ned, who, being in his teens, does not have the perspective that the older troopers have.<br /><br />The tone of this novel is a hybrid between King's \\"own\\" voice and that of his pseudonym's, Richard Bachman, a tightrope walk between optimism and cynicism.  The story slowly builds momentum, drawing the audience into the narrative so subtly that you find yourself a good two hundred pages into the book before looking up.  Of course, like most of King's novels, it features well-realized characters that evoke readers' sympathies.  Although King set the story in rural Pennsylvania, these characters resemble the native New Englanders with which King usually populates his tales, \\"keeping themselves to themselves,\\" accepting what life throws at them with preternatural calm and stoicism.  It is their all too human reactions to the strangeness that has entered their lives, rather than the special effects (which are plentiful) that make this book the subtle triumph that it is.o autopsy one of the creatures that emerged from its \\"womb.\\"  Despite this, he never finds definitive answers. <br /> <br />If From a Buick 8 is \\"about\\" something, it is about the fact that life itself rarely yields definitive answers.

US	52836712	R24AWEC95FPUMT	0312877196	789199749	Split Image	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Faust always delivers the goods	Spending a weekend in a friend's cabin in Wisconsin, frustrated playwright Andrew Neville decides to go bow hunting to pass the time. Neville manages to wound a deer and track it through the woods, only to find a stranger standing over his prey. Neville challenges the stranger, who calmly maintains it's a different deer. Neville continues to insist it is his kill, but the stranger dismisses his increasingly frantic assertions. This enrages Neville, who abruptly attacks the man with a hunting knife, slitting his throat. Composing himself, Neville leaves the woods after attempting to erase all signs of his presence there.<br /><br />Watching the papers for news of the killing, Neville is surprised to discover his victim is actually John Dempsey, an old acquaintance from his early days in the theatre. Neville brazenly attends the funeral, and introduces himself to Dempsey's widow, Claudia. They are attracted to each other, and Claudia invites him to stay on for a few days. Neville agrees, and slowly insuates himself into Claudia's life. Neville gradually takes over his victim's very existence, even coming to resemble Dempsey physically. Neville's new life is threatened, however, by the presence of Roland Schiess, a private investigator hired by Dempsey's parents, who suspect Claudia and Neville conspired to kill their son. Scheiss plays an unsavory Porfiry to Neville's Raskolnikov, eventually forcing Neville to strike back.<br /><br />Whether he's writing political thrillers like In the Forest of the Night (1992), suspense/comedy like Blue Moon (1994), or straight suspense like Split Image, Faust always delivers. In Neville, Faust has created a complex character whose first person narration will keep readers turning pages in sick fascination. Faust's exploration of duality is also fascinating, as Neville takes over not only Dempsey's life, but his work, a play which he subtly rewrites and passes off as his own (ironically, it brings him a measure of fame he never enjoyed on his own). Neville's calm acceptance of his murderous act and his usurpation of the trappings of his victim's existence are chilling. The cat and mouse game between him and Roland Scheiss is an added bonus, as it precipitates many of the macabre happenings that take place in the final third of the book.<br /><br />Neville's understated narrative lulls readers, giving the later events of the book more power. Readers know Neville is laying the seeds of his own destruction, but will be surprised at how those seeds bloom -- Neville is undone in truly spectacular fashion by a force of nature he thought he had tamed. Give Split Image and the rest of Faust's canon a try -- you won't be disappointed.enjoyed on his own).

It's brilliantly written and scary as hell.\\"<br /><br />Agreed.  Marshall (a.k.a. Michael Marshall Smith, author of Spares, One of Us and Only Forward) really delivers in this tale of paranoia and despair, told, until late in the novel, on two parallel tracks, one dealing with the LAPD Homicide Detective John Zandt's hunt for The Upright Man, a serial killer who taunts the authorities with a unique calling card, the other with ex-CIA agent Ward Hopkins' search for the truth behind his parents' untimely death.  Their independent investigations lead to discoveries that rock both their worlds.<br /><br />Besides providing plenty of fast paced, top-notch suspense, Marshall also dishes out plenty of droll humor, as when Hopkins reflects on an aging population:<br /><br />\\"I don't find it surprising that super old people are so odd and grumpy...I don't blame them for being out of sorts.  I'm just surprised that they don't take to the streets in packs, swearing and raising hell and getting drunk.  With demographics going the way they are, maybe that's going to be the next big thing.  Gangs of octogenarians, taking drugs and running amok.  Though walking amok is most likely, I guess-with maybe an hour of dozing amok in the afternoon.\\"<br /><br />The book's full of unconventional observations like this, expertly interspersed with the grim discoveries Zandt and Hopkins make along the way.  Besides provoking laughter, they also provide insights into the minds of Marshall's offbeat protagonists, insight that proves useful once the **** really hits the fan late in the novel.	2005-10-06

Enraged by his situation, he begins destroying his library, consigning dozens of precious tomes to the flames. He prays for release from his torment, pledging his soul in return for knowledge.<br /><br />Enter Mephistopheles, a being from another dimension, who promises Faust the knowledge he longs for, requiring only that Faust must be attentive to his teachings, and that he accept the consequences of his newly gained intellectual wealth. Even after being told that his knowledge will bring mankind to ruin, Faust concludes Mephistopheles has to be wrong (how could knowledge be bad, after all?) and begs him for his insights.<br /><br />The devil/alien grants Faust's wish and tragedy ensues. Faust's initial attempts to share his scientific advances with his fellow scholars are met with derision and scorn. It is only after he finds practical uses for them (like creating weapons of mass destruction) that people take notice. The increasingly misanthropic Faust ushers in the advances of the Industrial Age hundreds of years early, and, by book's end, seems destined to fulfill Mephistopheles dire predictions.<br /><br />This dark, witty, sarcastic book was one of the best reads of 1997, a well written, engrossing alternate history/fantasy. While exploring his own themes, Swanwick also makes the point that Jack Dann made in his excellent novel The Memory Cathedral: that man, by nature, is a brutal creature, who, given a choice, will pervert the wonders of science. Unlike Dann's protagonist (Leonardo da Vinci), Swanwick's Faust is virtually blind to the mayhem he's created, and becomes the prime mover in humanity's inexorable march to extinction. Faust seeks to lift humanity out of the dark ages, but only hastens its descent. Swanwick seems to be reminding readers of the old adage, \\"Be careful what you wish for, because you may get it.\\" Doing so, he provides a valuable, and extremely winning entertainment.uable, and extremely winning entertainment. <br />	2005-10-05
US	52836712	RZBU158YQCU69	0843946954	859692408	You Come When I Call You	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Impressive	I have to say that I was predisposed to like this book, primarily because I've always enjoyed Clegg's work, but also because of its evocative, provocative title, a command many of us have heard or (unfortunately) used, often in moments of extreme tension. The phrase not only captures the main emotions and themes of the book (many of the characters are victims of physical or sexual abuse), but also constitutes a powerful reminder of the perils its characters face.<br /><br />The book revisits a familiar Clegg theme, namely the iron grip that the past holds over the present. Here, a group of friends is haunted by events which took place in 1980, events which resulted in the virtual annihilation of their hometown of Palmetto, CA. Peter Chandler, Allison Hunt, and Charlie Urquart are among the few who know what really happened to the town, and have spent the next twenty years trying their best to forget.<br /><br />The town's destruction was orchestrated by Wendy Swan, who, it is later revealed, is a lamia, the product of an incestuous relationship between devil worshipper Rudy Swan and his sister Stella, a.k.a. \\"Queenie\\". Looking for a place to nest, Wendy chooses Palmetto. Her attempts to fill that nest with her heinous offspring lead her to seduce Peter, Charlie, and others. Ironically, it's their interference which ultimately frustrates her plans. Twenty years pass, and suddenly, the survivors again hear the lamia's call. Reluctantly abandoning the lives they have built, they return home to face their tormentor, possibly to embrace her, possibly to destroy her.<br /><br />Although the book contains echoes of Clegg's previous work such as THE HALLOWEEN MAN and THE CHILDREN'S HOUR (no surprise, since the three books were written during overlapping periods over a twelve year span), and of classics like SALEM'S LOT and GHOST STORY, it ultimately stands on its own, primarily due to Clegg's trademark strengths: rich, multi-layered storytelling, an ability to creatively rework stock genre themes, and a talent for creating characters that rise above the standard horror stereotypes. If the book has a weakness, it's Clegg's devotion to his characters -- his attempts to explore their personalities seemed to go on and on. This is a minor drawback, however. Just when the narrative energy appears to be waning, Clegg kicks the story into overdrive. After that, I was his, greedily consuming page after page on my way to the novel's volatile climax.ely rework stock genre themes, and a talent for creating characters that rise above the standard horror stereotypes.

US	52836712	R5GGPY4PKGPGB	0451409809	133200343	Run	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Powerful, compelling, expertly crafted	Although Burdon Lane's job is somewhat out of the mainstream--he's a gun runner, trafficking in illegal firearms--his anxieties mirror those of many of his middle aged contemporaries: even when things seem to be going well, he harbors fears of being derailed, of having the life he's so carefully built slip through his fingers. Thus, he initially questions his business partners when they ask him to join them on a supposed \\"milk run\\" to New York City. Despite his misgivings (the operation, involving two volatile street gangs, doesn't seem to require his presence), Lane agrees to participate, assured by his companions that nothing will go wrong.<br /><br /> But things do go wrong, and in spectacular fashion. As it turns out, the operation is a cover for the assassination of prominent civil rights leader Gideon Parks, gunned down during a political rally. Realizing that he is among those who have been left to take the fall for the crime, Lane runs for his life, vowing to get to the truth and punish those responsible. The remainder of the novel details his struggles to stay alive against formidable odds, as he uncovers the hidden subtext of his world, a place where nothing is as it seems, and alliances are broken and forged with alarming speed.<br /><br />Winter's first novel is a bleak, yet strangely optimistic thriller, an accomplished performance that delves deep into the heart and mind of its main protagonist, a criminal whose brutal mores and ambitions mask his all too human vulnerabilities. Lane's first person narrative, blunt and terse, convincingly conveys the surprising depth and variety of his emotions: his matter-of-fact attitude toward his strange career, his love for his deceased mother, the passion he feels for his girlfriend, and the anger he feels at the duplicity he endures. It also creates a sense of immediacy, one that becomes more noticeable as the book hurtles towards its bloody but inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />RUN seems to reflect the influence of several writers and filmmakers. Traces of Donald Westlake/Richard Stark, James Ellroy, Jim Carroll, William Goldman, Donald Goines, Quentin Tarantino and John Woo are evident, all filtered through Winter's unique sensibilities. As such, the book transcends those influences. Winter delivers an explosive tale of loyalty and betrayal, one which simultaneously honors and elevates the thriller genre.  Powerful, compelling, and expertly crafted, Run is a singular accomplishment.  We're talking serious crime fiction here folks, the kind that grabs you and doesn't let go.

Left alone in a squalid Boston apartment by her neglectful mother, four year old Amanda MacCready is kidnapped, creating an instant media sensation. Impatient with the police, Amanda's aunt and uncle plead with ex-cops Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro to join the investigation. Acting against their instincts, the lovers reluctantly accept the case. The search for Amanda takes a heavy toll on all involved, especially the private detectives -- they uncover a dark conspiracy that drains them physically, mentally and emotionally, causing them to question their beliefs and ideals. Normally sharing the same world view, the duo find themselves in opposition when confronted with a morally ambiguous situation at the end of the novel. The decisions they make at that crucial moment have a profound impact on their self images and on their future together.<br /><br />Besides its gripping subject matter, the most intriguing thing about this book is its twisting, labyrinthine plot -- Kenzie and Gennaro face steep odds in their quest to uncover the truth behind Amanda's disappearance. Lehane is in absolute control of this material, pointedly commenting on many of society's ills along the way. A memorable addition to the Kenzie/Gennaro canon, the events of GONE BABY GONE will linger in your memory long after you finish.	2005-10-04

In TIME TO HUNT, Stephen Hunter further embellishes the legend of master sniper Bob Lee Swagger. Known as \\"Bob the Nailer\\" in professional circles, Swagger is cunning, resourceful, and a remarkable marksman, skills he developed in his youth and honed during several memorable tours of duty in Vietnam. Because of these talents, Swagger is often drawn into scenarios that erupt into nightmarish violence, as depicted in POINT OF IMPACT and BLACK LIGHT, the first two books to feature this character.<br /><br />Although the prologue and final third of the novel occur today, the backbone of the book is set in Washington, DC and Vietnam circa 1970. The story focuses on a marine named Donny Fenn, serving in Washington after completing a tour of duty in Vietnam. Fenn, forced to spy on a fellow marine with ties to the peace movement, fails to carry out the wishes of his superiors and is summarily cycled back to the 'Nam. There, he links up with Swagger, the deadliest sniper in the Corps. Their subsequent heroics (set forth in violent detail by Hunter in some of his most gripping writing to date), add to the myth surrounding Swagger. Bona fide heroes, they are days away from returning home when they are attacked by their nemesis, the Russian sniper Soloratov. Swagger is wounded, and Fenn is killed. Although Swagger has no way of knowing it at that time, this attack holds the key to the mystery of why Soloratov has returned to threaten Swagger's wife and daughter three decades later.<br /><br />Hunter, like Swagger, is in a league by himself -- compulsively readable, he plunges readers into a world where conspiracies are the norm and sudden death is commonplace. From its explosive prologue to its gripping finale, TIME TO HUNT is certain to be one of the best pure suspense novels you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.	2005-10-04

Having barely survived the events related in that harrowing thriller, famous writer Andrew Thomas, now one of America's most wanted criminals, has settled in the Yukon after many years on the run.  Believing his ordeal over, Thomas is stunned to learn of the murder of a friend's wife and the kidnapping of a former flame.  Apparently, someone is trying to send him a message that the trials that commenced seven years prior are not over, and that a reckoning must occur.  Thomas travels to North Carolina and the Outerbanks island of Ocracoke to confront his adversary, setting the stage for an epic battle between the author and a man who can only be described as a relentless killing machine.<br /><br />Crouch's sophomore effort, a tense, violent, fast paced work of suspense, proves the author has not lost his ability to enthrall and surprise his audience-Locked Doors is just as slick and twisted and entertaining as Desert Places, perhaps even more so.  What distinguishes it from that novel is Crouch's focus on ancillary characters like homicide detective Violet King and would be true crime writer Horace Boone, which, rather than diverting readers' attention from the main battle, actually intensifies the experience once the blood starts to fly.<br /><br />Crouch's chief talent lies in dropping his characters into untenable, sanity threatening situations, and then letting all hell break loose.  This affinity for mayhem wreaks havoc with the reader's expectations, as neither the heroes nor the villains ever act predictably.  The relentless pace of the narrative and Crouch's clean, taut prose allows for a certain suspension of disbelief, making for a book that readers will be loathe to put down once they've begun.	2005-09-09

Although I'd never read anything by David Dun, I'd heard good things about previous novels like OVERFALL and UNACCEPTABLE RISK.  Based on that positive word of mouth, I decided to give his latest a try. It proved a good gamble--a clever, engaging, well-paced book, peopled with likeable characters and packed with intriguing ideas, Dun's novel hooked me with its first two sentences and held my rapt attention throughout its 479 page length. Although some aspects of the book proved bothersome upon deeper reflection, the immediate reading experience reminded me of watching a deftly plotted and executed action film, during which the nagging voices of reason are easily put on hold for a couple of hours.<br /><br />The novel begins with an attack on scientist Ben Anderson, one he barely escapes.  From then on, the book becomes one long chase, as the bad guys, led by the despicable Special Deputy Frick, pursue the good guys, consisting of Anderson and his extended family, adopted daughter Haley, Haley's friend Rachel, Ben's girlfriend Sarah, and his nephew, Sam Wintripp.  Dun reveals the reasons behind this frantic manhunt as the novel progresses, doling out bits of information between several high-octane action sequences.  Readers are constantly being pulled further into the story, as they learn the truth in tandem with the main characters; like those characters, they soon find themselves desperate for more answers.<br /><br />Dun writes such great action scenes that the book would have worked without the substance he eventually provides for what one of Alfred Hitchcock's friends referred to as a \\"MacGuffin\\", or the ostensible reason for the onscreen mayhem.  Often, the director would never even explore the \\"MacGuffin\\" in depth--it was usually sufficient that two parties were in contention for the prize, wreaking havoc in their pursuit.  Dun, however, eventually reveals the exact nature of what's at stake, namely the secret to human life extension, and the potential for a virtually limitless source of energy, both concepts carefully grounded in plausible scientific fact.<br /><br />Two elements of the book might bother some readers.  One is the \\"lucky\\" presence of an \\"an extremely competent man\\" or ECM for short.  In other novels and films, this is the ex-Navy seal/ex-Special Ops/ex-cop/etc. who, by coincidence, happens to be on the scene, providing the good guys with their one slim chance of survival.  In this instance, the ECM is ex-spy Sam Wintripp--in THE BLACK SILENT, Sam almost operates on the level of a superhero, inflicting and absorbing abuse seemingly beyond mortal capacity.  It might have been more acceptable if this book was written specifically as a Sam Wintripp novel (he's appeared in other Dun books), but that doesn't appear to be Dun's intention here.  The second is the book's over the top villain, Frick, a guy so depraved that even Jeffrey Dahmer would cross to the other side of the street to avoid him.  Frick hovers dangerously close to descending into parody; luckily, Dun seemingly knew just when to pull back to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />As stated above, however, these problems are not enough to sink the book, only to give pause.  A fearless storyteller, Dun ruthlessly captures his audience's attention in the book's initial paragraphs, and doesn't relinquish his grip until the final page is turned.

US	52836712	R3PXTY59KB5ZN5	159315237X	447056092	Creepers	Books	5	83	95	N	N	Morrell at the top of his game	As you get older, it's reassuring to note that your favorite writers are maintaining the high standards that attracted you to their work in the first place.  Writers who fall into this category, folks like Elmore Leonard, Lawrence Block and Donald E. Westlake, continue to produce quality work book after book, story after story.  Another member of this elite club is David Morrell, who, with the publication of Creepers, shows that he still has what it takes to satisfy even the most demanding thriller reader.<br /><br />Morrell's latest chronicles eight hours in the lives of five \\"creepers\\", urban explorers who break into abandoned or condemned buildings to experience their historical and architectural delights first hand.  This particular group, comprised of Professor Robert Conklin, high school teacher Vincent Vanelli, graduate students Rick and Cora Magill, and reporter Frank Balenger, has chosen the Paragon Hotel in Asbury Park as a target, accessing it via a series of underground tunnels.  Once inside, the situation deteriorates rapidly as the group discovers the Paragon is not the abandoned building they thought it was.  The perils presented by others in the building, and by the decayed hotel itself, place them all in mortal danger.  Before the night is through, some inside the Paragon will discover hidden depths of courage and resourcefulness; some will be revealed as liars and imposters; some will die.<br /><br />Morrell does an excellent job of accounting for almost every second of the eight hours of his story, as, in fact, it will take most readers about that long to read it.  The immediacy of the book is one of its greatest strengths--readers quickly start to feel as if they are looking over the shoulders of the team, almost like a sixth member.  Besides its immediacy and intimacy, the book is packed with surprising twists and turns, as the group is forced to think on its feet, reacting to the numerous threats they encounter.  And it's not only the dilapidated hotel that yields surprises, as several of Morrell's well-drawn cast of characters harbor their own secrets.<br /><br />It's difficult to pin any particular label on Creepers.  At heart a thriller, it also can be categorized as a gothic, horror, or even a time travel novel.  It's not clich&eacute; to say that Morrell gives readers one hell of a ride, as it's a perfect description of the feeling this book gives you--exciting, captivating and suspenseful, you'll no doubt find yourself thinking Creepers would easily lend itself to a variety of adaptations, whether it be as an action film, a video game, or virtual reality park attraction.  Suffice it to say that the man who has alternately been dubbed the \\"father of all modern action novels\\" and \\"the mild mannered professor with the bloody minded visions\\" has once again proven his considerable mettle, delivering yet another book sure to satisfy loyal fans and win him some new ones as well.apidated hotel that yields surprises, as several of Morrell's well-drawn cast of characters harbor their own secrets.   <br /> <br />It's difficult to pin any particular label on Creepers.

US	52836712	R2EUWRT1I6KLDV	0974290750	301496492	In Darkness Waiting	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The evil within	A great example of small town horror at its best, In Darkness Waiting tells the story of young Perry Strandman, who accompanies his Aunt June on a trip to the isolated town of Jasper, Oregon. June is traveling to the small hamlet to assist her friend Sandra Cummings in the care and treatment of her daughter Tetty, who has recently begun to display uncharacteristic violent tendencies.<br /><br />Even as they enter Sandra's home, the pair can sense something's very wrong with Tetty, who must be restrained for fear of her doing damage to herself and others. Perry soon learns that the wrongness he feels permeates the entire town. Eventually, he learns the true cause of that wrongness, a truth so fantastic he can barely comprehend it. Accepting that truth allows him to survive even as the rest of the townsfolk slowly succumb to an internal evil that apparently only requires extreme anger to emerge.<br /><br />Reminiscent of David Morrell's The Totem, In Darkness Waiting is, as Shirley himself notes in his fascinating introduction, an exploration of man's inhumanity to man, a search for an explanation of people's ability to dehumanize their fellow human beings to the point where their humiliation and torture become acceptable, even the norm. Unfortunately this tendency is not some historical or isolated oddity. Although Shirley cites the Nazi soldiers who killed millions of Jews as a primary example of this sickness, he can also refer to the recent atrocities which occurred at the Abu Gharib prison in Iraq to illustrate his point.<br /><br />This being a Shirley novel, however, means that his search is approached in fictional terms, through the vehicle of story, rather than through an analysis of dry, clinical data. Taking this tack, Shirley combines elements of both quiet horror and splatterpunk to great effect, slowly creating a palpable sense of menace which culminates in one of the most horrific and surreal set pieces you're ever likely to read. Doing so, Shirley once again proves that his name should be included among the ranks of those considered as the modern masters of horror. If you haven't read this novel in its previous incarnation, then by all means do so now.ley once again proves that his name should be included among the ranks of those considered as the modern masters of horror.

Considering the plethora of colorful, hard edged female series characters who've appeared in the mystery genre over the last couple of decades--Linda Fairstein's Alexandra Cooper, Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plumb, and Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon are a few of the more prominent--it's sobering to recall that a little over twenty-five years ago a female lead was a rarity.<br /><br />From the late seventies through the early eighties, Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone pretty much had the field to herself.  Muller's groundbreaking work served as inspiration for two successful series characters, who in turn paved the way for the rest: Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, who first appeared in 1985, and her immediate predecessor, Sarah Paretsky's scrappy V.I. Warshawski.  Along with McCone, these characters served as templates for those that followed: bright, quirky, and tough, they faced the world on their own terms, professionals who had learned to survive in what was then perceived to be a man's world.<br /><br />Personally, I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Warshawski.  That's why I was so glad to see Vic back after a five year sabbatical in HARD TIME, once again facing off against stiff odds and ruthless opponents.<br /><br />Driving home from a party honoring Lacey Dowell, a local girl who has risen to Hollywood stardom, Warshawski wrecks her Trans trying to avoid a body lying in the street.  After extracting herself from the car, Warshawski discovers the body to be that of an Hispanic woman who appears to have been very badly beaten; in an odd coincidence, the woman is wearing a Lacey Dowell T-shirt.  Warshawski has little time to reflect on this, however, as the woman is quickly placed in an ambulance and driven away.  After answering some questions from the local authorities, Warshawski returns home and goes to bed.<br /><br />Warshawski's problems begin early the next morning--the woman, now identified as Nicola Aguinaldo, has died, and an overzealous policeman by the name of Lemour seems hell-bent on framing Warshawski for Nicola's murder.  Acting in self-defense, Warshawski digs into Nicola's past, discovering that she had escaped from Coolis, a private prison facility run by B.B. Balladine, owner of Carnifice, a rival private investigation firm.  The case becomes more interesting when V.I. discovers that Nicola was formerly employed as nanny to Balladine's children, and was in prison for stealing jewelry from his wife.  She also uncovers a connection between Balladine and Lacey Dowell's employer, Global Studios mogul Ted Trent. Questions begin to pile up:  How does a prison escapee end up wearing a one of a kind Lacey Dowell T-shirt?  Why does Global claim the designer of the shirt, Dowell's childhood friend Lucian Frenada, has been stalking her?  Why does Global seek to hire Warshawski to investigate Frenada?  Finally, what is the connection between Global Studios and Coolis prison?  Warshawski, whose quest for answers ends in her unlawful imprisonment in Coolis, risks life and limb to find out.<br /><br />Early on in the novel, a character asks Warshawski, \\"You've been an investigator for sixteen years, Vic.  What keeps you going when your annual billings barely cover your expenses?\\"  A bemused Warshawski replies, \\"Idealism and naivete, Bob.  And curiosity, of course, about what happens next.\\"  Reading that, I realized that's what keeps me coming back for more--the need to find out what happens next in V.I.'s endlessly complicated life.  The series remains fresh due to V.I.'s continuous evolution.  She's aging, and thus is not able to rely on her reflexes the way she used to, a fact which is emphasized several times over the course of the novel.  Vic comes to realize that she now has to think her problems through, rather than acting on instinct.  This gives her new depth and maturity-by novel's end, a new Warshawski has emerged from the chrysalis of the old.  Paretsky creates a potent metaphor for this change--V.I.'s time in the prison, coupled with her near death experience there, can be viewed as a rebirth of the character.  Reborn through trauma, baptized in pain, a new, more seasoned Warshawski emerges to face the second act that is her life..I.'s time in the prison, coupled with her near death experience there, can be viewed as a rebirth of the character.

Rookie firefighter Jason Gum commits an error in the latter category when he misses a call because he's in the middle of a sexual encounter with Iola Pederson, an older married woman he just met, in the weight room of the firehouse.  Because two fellow firefighters help him conceal his indiscretion, he feels obligated to turn a blind eye to their activities when they subsequently violate department policy by removing three garbage bags full of bearer bonds from the scene of another call where they discover the body of an old man.  Gum learns the painful truth that lies often breed more lies, and that some lies can lead to murder.<br /><br />The Shamus Award winning author of the Thomas Black detective series (The Portland Laugher is a high point in that eleven book saga), Emerson has in the last few years penned several novels set in the world of firefighting, The Smoke Room being his fourth such effort.  As filtered through the perceptions of the naive yet oddly appealing Jason Gum, Emerson's latest plunges readers into that dangerous world, into a perilous milieu where you're as likely to be killed by comrades as by the dangers inherent in firefighting.  Scarily authentic and utterly captivating, full of numerous twists and turns, The Smoke Room is an engrossing tale of deceit and danger, cowardice and courage, easily one of the most compelling books you'll encounter this year.	2005-07-21
US	52836712	R1RSZ3JNJ0LT6O	0440206154	247672694	Red Dragon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The life and times of Dr. Hannibal Lector	In recent years, serial killers, like vampires, have come to occupy their own sub genre.  Many authors have attempted to tackle the subject, with varying degrees of success.  No one, however, does serial killers better than Thomas Harris, author of RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL.  Taken together, these books constitute a bridge between such groundbreaking work as Robert Bloch's PSYCHO and the surfeit of serial killer novels published over the last fifteen years.  These classics also introduced the public to the concept of serial killer as media star, featuring the most popular anti-hero of modern times, Dr. Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />Lector is enigmatic, highly intelligent and erudite.  Before his capture, he killed and cannibalized at least nine people (the media later dubbed him \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\").  As you might suspect, Lector's activities created quite a stir, eventually bringing Will Graham, an FBI investigator, to Lector's office (Lector had actually been the treating physician for one of the victims).  During a conversation with the doctor, Graham has an epiphany and realizes Lector is the killer.  Lector, perceiving that Graham has found him out, attempts escape.  Catching Graham off guard, he guts him with a linoleum knife and flees, only to be captured later by the authorities.<br /><br />All this is background taken from RED DRAGON, published in 1981.  As that novel begins, Lector resides in a high security mental facility, placed there by a court.  Graham, recuperating from his wounds, is in semi-retirement.  He is approached by Jack Crawford, his former boss at the FBI.  Crawford seeks Graham's aid in the pursuit of a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (so-named for his penchant for biting his victims), who has already slaughtered two innocent families.<br /><br />Graham reluctantly agrees to help.  Hoping to revive his investigative instincts, he visits Lector in his lair.  Lector, unhelpful, nevertheless takes an interest in the case and manages to insert himself into the action, providing the Tooth Fairy with Will's home address.  This information puts Will and his family in danger, as the hunted turns on the hunter.  At book's end, the Tooth Fairy is dead, and Will is disfigured for life.  From his cell, Lector has managed to achieve a measure of vengeance on Graham.<br /><br />Lector also plays a key role in the sequel to RED DRAGON, 1988's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is asked by Jack Crawford to interview the good doctor for a study on serial killers.  Clarice visits Lector, but is unable to convince him to participate in the study.  Lector, intrigued by young Clarice, offers her something better--his assistance on a current case involving a killer nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\" (so named because he \\"skins his humps\\").<br /><br />Clarice becomes an active participant in the hunt for Buffalo Bill, acting as intermediary between Lector and the FBI.  Lector, with previous knowledge of the killer, cunningly manipulates all involved.  His orchestrations eventually provide him with an opportunity to escape, one which he eagerly seizes.  Clarice, acting on hints dropped by the doctor, eventually tracks Bill down, but her victory is tempered by the knowledge that Dr. Lector is once again at large.<br /><br />These two novels are acknowledged classics of suspense and the aforementioned serial killer genre.  Well written, they don't rely on shock value alone to jolt readers.  Harris masterfully creates and sustains tension, building to tremendous crescendos in both books.  Other authors have written successfully in this genre, but they tend to rely on splatter to achieve their horrific effect, each subsequent novel trying to outdo its predecessors in terms of gore and perversion.  One quickly becomes inured to that type of book--instead of revulsion, you react with a yawn.  If you read of such actions in the newspaper, you would be horrified; in fiction it is oldhat.  Harris avoids this trap, relying on good old-fashioned story telling to make his point.<br /><br />Harris resisted the obvious temptation to feature Lector more prominently in these novels, showing admirable restraint in reining in this strong character, using him to enhance, rather than dominate, the action.  It would have been very easy for Harris to allow the good doctor to move to center stage--Lector is mesmerizing.  Like Sherlock Holmes, he transcends the boundaries of literature, leaving his many \\"fans\\" clamoring for more.  Anthony Hopkins' riveting portrayal of Dr. Lector on the silver screen only added to his luster, introducing him to an audience unfamiliar with Harris' novels.<br /><br />1999's HANNIBAL changed that forever.  Featuring Lector as its chief protagonist, and Clarice Starling in a supporting role, this ambitious novel began to unravel the mystery behind the killer, providing tantalizing glimpses into his history and motivations.  Many were upset by this, preferring Lector's past to remain murky.  A large portion of Harris' readership was also turned off by the book's ending, feeling that Starling's fate was inappropriate.  However you see it, you have to admire the risks Harris took, making Lector into an almost \\"Bondian\\" hero, having him square off against the obsessive Mason Verger, a horribly scarred, megarich supervillain he helped create.<br /><br />Supposedly a fourth book (listed as BEHIND THE MASK on Amazon) is forthcoming, but, until it's finally published, we all will have to be content with these three books.  If you haven't read them, get busy.  If you don't think rereading them will be rewarding, think again--none of the thrills or scares are diminished, despite the fact you know they're coming.in fiction it is old hat.

US	52836712	R36ELUQSVRA6A4	0553803301	652723720	Blown	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A sleeper agent wreaks havoc in the U.S.	After almost single-handedly taking down the international terrorist organization Thirty April (as described in Mathews' 2001 novel, The Cutout), CIA Agent Caroline Carmichael assumes she will have sufficient time to recoup the considerable physical and mental strength expended to achieve that goal.  Her assumption is proven wrong only weeks later when a Thirty April sleeper agent suddenly attacks on U.S. soil, slaughtering hundreds of runners participating in the Washington DC Marine Corp marathon with ricin laced water.  Marked as a target by the terrorist in his public pronouncements, Caroline has extra motivation to track him down before he can fulfill the rest of his lethal objectives.<br /><br />There's much to admire about Blown--its intense action scenes, deliberate pacing, knowing characterization, and capacity to keep readers guessing are just a few qualities that spring to mind--but its most appealing aspect is by far its powerful and unsettling plot, dealing with the aftermath of the apparent downfall of a major terrorist organization.  Unlike most novels of this type, which naively assume the danger is over as soon as the organization's top leadership is eliminated, Blown points out that the danger persists as long as even one even slightly competent person still believes in the group's goals.  Proceeding from this premise, Mathews spins a hair-raising thriller guaranteed to spur readers' thinking about just how vulnerable they really are.	2005-07-19

One is Jackie Klevinski, a victim of spousal abuse.  The other, later dubbed the \\"A-bomber,\\" is an anarchist bearing a grudge against society.  These two disparate souls eventually gain the attention of Ephron's series characters, forensic psychologist Peter Zak and his significant other, private investigator Annie Squires; Zach allies himself with the Cambridge, Massachusetts police to track down the bomber, while Annie squares off against wife beater Joe Klevinski.  Their involvement in each case proves risky to both their psyches and persons.<br /><br />Despite the expectations created by its title, Guilt does not directly deal with either culpability or self-reproach.  A more appropriate title might have been Doubt, which better describes the state of mind of Ephron's protagonists--Zak feels unsure of himself when asked to assume the unfamiliar role of profiler, and Annie is conflicted about her efforts to assist the unappreciative Jackie Klevinski. This understandable doubt allows readers to better identify with the characters, at the same time increasing the level of suspense.<br /><br />Regardless of the suitability of its title, the book makes for involving reading; the writing is lively, the pace deliberate, and its characterizations ring true.  With Guilt, Ephron (a pseudonym for the writing team of Hallie Ephron and Dr. Don Davidof) adds another enticing entry to the ongoing Peter Zak series.  Although familiarity with previous installments is not necessary to appreciate Guilt, readers will likely feel compelled to seek them out upon finishing.	2005-07-19

In the case of The Inside Ring, however, you'd be dead wrong--the ride just keeps getting hairier as the story progresses.<br /><br />Investigating the assassination attempt at the behest of Speaker of the House is attorney Joe DeMarco, a gifted troubleshooter whose byword is discretion.  Although a viable suspect has already been identified, Speaker Mahoney is privy to inside information which suggests that there was more to the shooting than is readily apparent.  Poking into the matter, DeMarco uncovers some troubling facts concerning Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly and Agent Billy Mattis, a member of the unit assigned to protect the President on the day of the shooting.  Backed up by a unique support system, Demarco doggedly pursues the truth, placing himself in jeopardy.<br /><br />Although marred by some of Lawson's lazy habits (he's fond of describing characters as looking like one movie star or another), The Inside Ring is a great read, a book that combines action and humor to great effect.  With a plot reminiscent of one John Grisham might cobble together, and a villain seemingly imported from one of John D. MacDonald's Travis MacGee books, Lawson's first effort provides a great jump off point for a series, which, judging from the publicity materials, was the author's intent.  Readers will certainly clamor for future installments from Lawson, a welcome new presence on the thriller scene.	2005-07-19
US	52836712	R1UUS78CWUEEJZ	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	4	5	8	N	N	The life and times of Dr. Hannibal Lector	In recent years, serial killers, like vampires, have come to occupy their own sub genre.  Many authors have attempted to tackle the subject, with varying degrees of success.  No one, however, does serial killers better than Thomas Harris, author of RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL.  Taken together, these books constitute a bridge between such groundbreaking work as Robert Bloch's PSYCHO and the surfeit of serial killer novels published over the last fifteen years.  These classics also introduced the public to the concept of serial killer as media star, featuring the most popular anti-hero of modern times, Dr. Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />Lector is enigmatic, highly intelligent and erudite.  Before his capture, he killed and cannibalized at least nine people (the media later dubbed him \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\").  As you might suspect, Lector's activities created quite a stir, eventually bringing Will Graham, an FBI investigator, to Lector's office (Lector had actually been the treating physician for one of the victims).  During a conversation with the doctor, Graham has an epiphany and realizes Lector is the killer.  Lector, perceiving that Graham has found him out, attempts escape.  Catching Graham off guard, he guts him with a linoleum knife and flees, only to be captured later by the authorities.<br /><br />All this is background taken from RED DRAGON, published in 1981.  As that novel begins, Lector resides in a high security mental facility, placed there by a court.  Graham, recuperating from his wounds, is in semi-retirement.  He is approached by Jack Crawford, his former boss at the FBI.  Crawford seeks Graham's aid in the pursuit of a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (so-named for his penchant for biting his victims), who has already slaughtered two innocent families.<br /><br />Graham reluctantly agrees to help.  Hoping to revive his investigative instincts, he visits Lector in his lair.  Lector, unhelpful, nevertheless takes an interest in the case and manages to insert himself into the action, providing the Tooth Fairy with Will's home address.  This information puts Will and his family in danger, as the hunted turns on the hunter.  At book's end, the Tooth Fairy is dead, and Will is disfigured for life.  From his cell, Lector has managed to achieve a measure of vengeance on Graham.<br /><br />Lector also plays a key role in the sequel to RED DRAGON, 1988's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is asked by Jack Crawford to interview the good doctor for a study on serial killers.  Clarice visits Lector, but is unable to convince him to participate in the study.  Lector, intrigued by young Clarice, offers her something better--his assistance on a current case involving a killer nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\" (so named because he \\"skins his humps\\").<br /><br />Clarice becomes an active participant in the hunt for Buffalo Bill, acting as intermediary between Lector and the FBI.  Lector, with previous knowledge of the killer, cunningly manipulates all involved.  His orchestrations eventually provide him with an opportunity to escape, one which he eagerly seizes.  Clarice, acting on hints dropped by the doctor, eventually tracks Bill down, but her victory is tempered by the knowledge that Dr. Lector is once again at large.<br /><br />These two novels are acknowledged classics of suspense and the aforementioned serial killer genre.  Well written, they don't rely on shock value alone to jolt readers.  Harris masterfully creates and sustains tension, building to tremendous crescendos in both books.  Other authors have written successfully in this genre, but they tend to rely on splatter to achieve their horrific effect, each subsequent novel trying to outdo its predecessors in terms of gore and perversion.  One quickly becomes inured to that type of book--instead of revulsion, you react with a yawn.  If you read of such actions in the newspaper, you would be horrified; in fiction it is oldhat.  Harris avoids this trap, relying on good old-fashioned story telling to make his point.<br /><br />Harris resisted the obvious temptation to feature Lector more prominently in these novels, showing admirable restraint in reining in this strong character, using him to enhance, rather than dominate, the action.  It would have been very easy for Harris to allow the good doctor to move to center stage--Lector is mesmerizing.  Like Sherlock Holmes, he transcends the boundaries of literature, leaving his many \\"fans\\" clamoring for more.  Anthony Hopkins' riveting portrayal of Dr. Lector on the silver screen only added to his luster, introducing him to an audience unfamiliar with Harris' novels.<br /><br />1999's HANNIBAL changed that forever.  Featuring Lector as its chief protagonist, and Clarice Starling in a supporting role, this ambitious novel began to unravel the mystery behind the killer, providing tantalizing glimpses into his history and motivations.  Many were upset by this, preferring Lector's past to remain murky.  A large portion of Harris' readership was also turned off by the book's ending, feeling that Starling's fate was inappropriate.  However you see it, you have to admire the risks Harris took, making Lector into an almost \\"Bondian\\" hero, having him square off against the obsessive Mason Verger, a horribly scarred, megarich supervillain he helped create.<br /><br />Supposedly a fourth book (listed as BEHIND THE MASK on Amazon) is forthcoming, but, until it's finally published, we all will have to be content with these three books.  If you haven't read them, get busy.  If you don't think rereading them will be rewarding, think again--none of the thrills or scares are diminished, despite the fact you know they're coming.in fiction it is old hat.

US	52836712	R36728UV39GOQ3	0525948740	864602598	The Innocent	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Coben outdoes himself	The nature of sin, the possibility of redemption, and the influence of the past on the present are the three central conceits of Harlan Coben's latest thriller, The Innocent. The protagonist of the novel is one Matt Hunter, an ex-con who did time for accidentally killing a total stranger in a  brawl that simply got out of hand. Although Matt's entire existence since has been colored by this one mistake, he tries not to let it determine how he lives his life.<br /><br />If there's one person Matt believes he can rely on, it's his wife Olivia. That is, however, until the day he receives a video via his new cell phone showing her in a seedy hotel room with another man, apparently getting ready to have sex. That same day, he realizes persons unknown are following him. Matt doesn't put it together immediately, but these two anomalies are linked; as he slowly uncovers the bizarre truth behind these occurrences, he painfully discovers that he's not the only one with a past that haunts him.<br /><br />Always worth reading, Coben outdoes himself in The Innocent, creating his most poignant and compelling novel yet. Although its violence and dark themes can lead readers to conclude it is a crime novel or thriller, it is, at its heart, a story about the nature of love, of how love can provide hope or shatter it, of how it can lead to greater things or provoke the most sordid of behaviors. Beautifully and tightly crafted, The Innocent's greatest strength lies in its vivid characters, and in Coben's ability to make us feel what they feel, no matter how dissimilar their circumstances might be from ours. This virtue makes it one of the more involving thrillers to come along in years.	2005-07-08
US	52836712	R7YCG6C2150J	1931082723	140297629	H. P. Lovecraft: Tales (Library of America)	Books	4	104	118	N	Y	An excellent collection	Although I consider myself well read in the horror genre, I have to confess that, until recently, I had never read an H. P. Lovecraft story all the way through.  Yes, despite numerous attempts beginning in my teens, I had never finished a single story by one of the most influential horror writers of the early twentieth century.  Oh, I owned many of the myriad Lovecraft collections that had been issued over  the years, including those beautiful Arkham House editions, but all they did was accumulate dust. And yes, I knew what the word \\"Lovecraftian\\" meant, having read many of the pastiches, takeoffs, satires, homages, etc. that have been published over the years. Thus, I knew to shudder at the mention of Cthulhu (even if I didn't know how to spell it), or to laugh knowingly when someone mentioned old Howard Philip's excesses as a writer. Sadly, it was all a sham.  To paraphrase Woody Allen, it was a mockery of a travesty of a sham of two mockeries of a sham.<br /><br />Thinking, like Seinfeld's Cosmo Kramer, that I had \\"missed my chance\\" (I held the opinion that Lovecraft was one of those writers one had to embrace in his teens or not at all), I had reconciled myself to the fact that I probably would never read the old master.<br /><br />Enter Peter Straub and S.T. Joshi.<br /><br />I list Straub first because he served as the editor for the Library of America volume on Lovecraft, the one that intrigued me enough to start thinking about sampling Lovecraft again. But it was S.T., a Lovecraft scholar's Lovecraft scholar who actually coaxed me to read it.<br /><br />I contacted S. T. (whose corrected HPL texts were used in the book) seeking a nudge, and a nudge I got. Still subconsciously looking for a way out of it, however, I asked whether Lovecraft was somebody best sampled in one's teens, kind of like the way you have to read Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL at eighteen to enjoy it properly (look it up, it's a law). S. T. reacted with righteous disdain, replying:<br /><br />\\"I would dispute the belief that one has to read Lovecraft at an early age to get a \\"kick\\" out of him. As I progress in years and reread his work, I find new things to appreciate in it. Perhaps the overwhelming emotional effect is not there at my advanced age of 46, but then I'm not sure that I get an overwhelming emotional effect from *anything* I read these days.... My admiration of Lovecraft as an artist continues to grow the more I learn about him.\\"<br /><br />Well, when a reknowned expert like Joshi says something like this, it just has to make you curious. So, I read, and...well, it wasn't like Saul on the road to Damascus or anything, but hell, I had a pretty good time. Working through Lovecraft's dense, outdated prose was tough, but ultimately rewarding (although if I read one more time that some narrator can't describe something because it's so mind boggling, so foul or so corrupt that it defies description, I might puke, more in a fit of pique rather than out of disgust ). As Lloyd Rose, writing about this volume in the May 15, 2005 issue of the Washington Post said, \\"No doubt about it, Lovecraft had a vision.\\"<br /><br />The book itself is a thing of beauty, a thick, distinguished, perfect bound volume that anyone would be proud to have on his or her book shelf. Straub did an excellent job in selecting the twenty two stories featured, including such recognized classics as \\"The Outsider\\", \\"The Rats in the Walls\\", \\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\", \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", \\"The Lurking Fear\\", and the wonderfully campy (but somewhat racist) \\"Herbert West: Reanimator\\", while also including less \\"canonical\\" works such as \\"Cool Air.\\" I think that even aficionados like Mr. Joshi would agree that the tales that made the final cut arguably represent the best of Lovecraft.<br /><br />If you're at all like me (and, for your sake, I hope that's not the case) The Library of America edition of Lovecraft's tales will probably whet your appetite for moreof the old master. It's weird, but...the Arkham Lovecraft books on my bedroom shelf seem to be...calling out...to me...I feel compelled to...to...it's just too horrific to describe...tentacles, and eyes...goodbye...petite for more of the old master.

US	52836712	R2YETOEB3ILR0A	0843955430	713197310	The Girl Next Door	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Not for the faint of heart	The Girl Next Door isn't a book you reread casually--it's one of those books that lingers in your memory, like a tragedy you actually experienced first hand.  You remember how you felt after finishing it the first time--drained and numb--and you're not eager to repeat the experience.<br /><br />But reread it I did, because I've always considered the book a classic of suspense.  Clean, sleek prose, a gripping plot skillfully executed--the book's only weak point was the crappy cover Warner slapped on the original edition (featuring a skeletal cheerleader!--if you want to see Ketchum cringe like a vampire in a sun room, present him with a copy of the old paperback!). It's just that the book was so damn depressing, largely because of the grim events depicted  inside, but also because it felt too real. At times, it seemed as if Ketchum was describing my old neighborhood, my friends (and enemies), people I knew. It just hit too close to home.<br /><br />The Girl Next Door is narrated by David Moran, a 41-year-old Wall Street executive. David seemingly has it all, but inside he carries the emotional scars he received as a twelve year old during the harrowing summer of 1958, when Meg Loughlin moved in next door.  Fourteen-year-old Meg and her younger sister Susan, orphaned in an automobile accident, are taken in by their Aunt, Ruth Chandler. Ruth, a single mother of three loutish sons, is a bitter woman who takes an almost instant dislike to her beautiful young niece. David watches as Ruth's abuse of Meg and Susan escalates until even her children feel free to participate. The situation degenerates until Meg literally becomes a prisoner in the Chandlers' basement fallout shelter. David, witness to these events, is torn by feelings of loyalty to Ruth and his friends, sexual curiosity about Meg, and his sense that it will all end tragically if no one intervenes.<br /><br />As this wasn't my first reading, I didn't feel compelled to race ahead to find out what happened next, and could take the time to appreciate the sheer craftsmanship of Ketchum's work.  His reflections on fifties suburbia and on the powerlessness of children are keen and insightful--Ketchum remembers the fear, wonder and inherent dangers of being a child.  He slowly increases the tension to nearly unbearable levels, so that, by mid-book, it feels like you've reached the top of a roller coaster. Then, as on a real roller coaster, Ketchum plunges readers straight down into the abyss at blinding speed, pulling out all the stops, propelling the narrative to its grim conclusion.<br /><br />Impressive for Ketchum's control, sense of place, and the way he blends harrowing action and social commentary, The Girl Next Door is one book guaranteed to provoke strong reactions in readers.  It's one hell of a ride, but one most will consider well worth taking.d next, and could take the time to appreciate the sheer craftsmanship of Ketchum's work.

It's a measure of Arnzen's talent that he more often than not achieves this goal, all without losing sight of a couple basic tenets of storytelling, those being to grab and hold your reader, and maybe make him think in the bargain. Despite the limits he's imposed on himself, Arnzen still proves capable of doing just that in little gems like \\"Nightmare Job #1\\" through \\"Nightmare Job #5\\" (think of it as a mini miniseries), \\"The Curse of Fat Face,\\" and \\"Her Daily Bread.\\" One warning before you begin 100 Jolts, though--like the candy in a Whitman sampler, you'll find yourself gobbling up one tale after another.

Piccirilli picks up their story almost exactly where he left it, with McClaren still trying to deal with the tragic death of his parents, his sister's past life as a bounty hunter, and his passion for his ex-lover Sarah. This time out, McClaren and the black ex-Union soldier Lamarr are asked by Sarah to travel to Mexico to rescue her new husband, Septemus Hart (Lamarr's hated daddy), who's being held hostage by Don Braulio, a local baddie who likes to dispatch his victims with custom made knives. Doing so, they find danger and intrigue, encounter old enemies, and discover some ugly truths about themselves and those around them.<br /><br />Piccirilli continues to show a real affinity for the western, producing a story with generous helpings of humor, action, and existential angst. It's obvious he knows his characters inside and out, and that he's been living with them for quite some time-the story seems to be being told by someone who witnessed the events firsthand. Everything else works just splendidly-Piccirilli's dialogue shines, and the set pieces he creates are harrowing, often humorous, and very true to life.  Check out Chapter Two for the best example of this-Piccirilli's writing in this scene is particularly vivid and cinematic.<br /><br />A tale of tortured, complex characters trying to make sense of their twisted lives while also trying to \\"do the right thing,\\" Coffin Blues is wildly entertaining, featuring the kind of writing that keeps you flipping pages past the point of exhaustion. A traditional western skewed by Piccirilli's offbeat sensibilities, Coffin Blues should appeal to horror and western fans alike.	2005-04-04

Paul Wilson published his first horror novel, The Keep in 1981. Discussing the book in Horror: 100 Best Books, J. N. Williamson wrote, \\"It is difficult...to imagine anything essential to the genre's form which was omitted. Whatever a reader or reviewer of horror fiction thinks primary-necessary in the sense of originality of idea, basic to tight plotting and its progression, desirable in characterization and imperative in terms of suspense, surprise and the inexorable buildup of the total storyline from event to event, chapter to chapter-seems to me present in Dr. Wilson's work.\\"<br /><br />After The Keep, Wilson published five more books in what he came to call the \\"Adversary Cycle\\": The Tomb (1984), The Touch (1986), Reborn (1990), Reprisal (1991), and Nightworld (1992). Apocalyptic fiction at its best, the Adversary Cycle introduced several concepts that came to form the core of much of Wilson's fictional universe:  the ancient, evil entity called Rasalom, his eternal opponent Glaeken, the town of Monroe, Long Island (Wilson's analog of Arkham, Oxrun Station, and Castle Rock), the wandering healing spirit known as the Dat-tay-vao (first seen in The Touch), and the modern pulp hero known as Repairman Jack.<br /><br />The secretive Jack, who conceals his existence from the world, made his first appearance in The Tomb. Not wanting to be locked in to writing a series character, Wilson left him near death at the end of that novel, only to have him reappear in Nightworld, playing a key role in frustrating Rasalom's bid to enslave humanity. Jack's fans proving persistent, Wilson responded with a new Repairman Jack novel, titled Legacies in 1998, following it with Conspiracies (1999), All the Rage (2000), Hosts (2001), The Haunted Air (2002), and Gateways (2003). Set between the events in The Tomb and Nightworld, the books chronicle Jack's growing awareness of the battle between Rasalom and the entity he refers to as `the Otherness\\" or \\" the Ally.\\" Similar to the late Isaac Asimov, Wilson is working to link the bulk of his fictional output, subtly revising the books in the Adversary Cycle to fit the new continuity he is creating through his Repairman Jack novels.<br /><br />CrissCross, the latest installment in Jack's ongoing saga, finds Dr. Wilson in excellent form. As is his custom, he gives Jack two problems which inevitably converge-as Jack was told in an earlier story, there are no more coincidences for him. This time out, the repairman attempts to rescue a convert to the up and coming religion of Dortmentalism, at the same time trying to extricate a Catholic nun from a sticky blackmail situation. Rather than reveal too much of Wilson's engaging plot, let's just say that the author seems to take great pleasure in complicating Jack's already complex existence; readers, especially fans of rugged types like Travis McGee, will delight in watching Wilson extricate his creation from the deadly situations he's concocted. Their only qualm will come from the realization that as Jack draws closer to his date with destiny, the series will inevitably draw to a close. Enjoy it while it lasts.lar to the late Isaac Asimov, Wilson is working to link the bulk of his fictional output, subtly revising the books in the Adversary Cycle to fit the new continuity he is creating through his Repairman Jack novels. <br /> <br />CrissCross, the latest installment in Jack's ongoing saga, finds Dr. Wilson in excellent form.

Some visited to see the latest Vaudeville attraction, others danced to swing music played by the premier big bands, still others attended performances by the likes of the Talking Heads and the Ramones. Now dilapidated, it still holds an attraction for some. One such individual, Benedict West, returns again and again to seek clues to the mysterious disappearance of his lover, Mariah, who, like countless others, were last seen at the Luxor. Others, like the bullied Ellery Hann and the pregnant Robyn Vincent, are instinctively drawn there. When the trio comes together to delve more deeply into the secrets of the old dance hall, they find themselves pitted against unearthly forces they can barely comprehend.<br /><br />In This Skin works well enough overall, but it's not prime Clark-despite some genuinely creepy moments, it suffers in comparison to earlier efforts like Vamphyrric, which is guaranteed to make the hair the back of your neck stand up. Part of the problem is that Clark is not working in his customary milieu, having set the novel in modern day mid-west America, instead of his native England. As a result, the main characters will seem just a bit \\"off\\" to American readers. Another problem (for me, at least) is the novel's uncanny, hopefully unintentional parallels to the 1955 movie \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" what with disaffected youth coming to form a family unit after spending time in a deserted building. Half expecting Jim Backus to emerge from the shadows, dressed in an apron, somewhat diminished the tension Clark labored so mightily to build.	2005-04-04

Initially seeing it as an adventure, the pair starts to have second thoughts moments after entering the mystic's residence.  First, they meet a black woman and her child in what amounts to the waiting room; the four-year-old boy's fascination with Roberta's condition makes them uneasy. Then, they meet Samuel's overly defensive aide, who peppers them with annoying questions. Finally, they meet Samuel himself, a curious figure of a man protected by two vicious Dobermans.<br /><br />Seeing to his customer's request, Samuel dangles a pendant over Roberta's womb. Initially, the pendant sways back and forth. Then, gathering unnatural speed, the pendant actually leaps out of Samuel's hand and starts to bore into Roberta's exposed skin before the shocked magic man can yank it away. All are parties are shaken by the incident, which they quickly bury in their memories. The strange events of that day are not so easily dismissed, however; forces behind human comprehension are at work, forces which eventually come to threaten the lives of Roberta's progeny.<br /><br />An absorbing first novel, Family Inheritance is a well-written, tightly plotted work brimming with the energy and enthusiasm only a fledgling writer can bring to bear.  Happily, it exhibits few of the excesses and lapses that commonly mar such efforts. Writing with a Southerner's abiding sense of place, Leblanc lavishes copious amounts of attention on her cast, building credibility for the time she plunges readers deep into more fantastic territory--it's a tribute to her skill that we go so willingly. A richly imagined, atmospheric dark fantasy oozing with dread and menace, the novel is a memorable debut from a writer obviously devoted to her craft.	2005-04-04

Keller is pursuing DeWayne Puryear, who skipped bail on a lesser charge shortly before killing Raymond and John Lee Oxendine's father during a robbery.  Accompanied by his cousin Leonard, DeWayne goes on the lam.  Unfortunately for them, however, they've incurred the wrath of the resourceful and tenacious Oxendine brothers, who seek revenge for their father's murder.<br /><br />The hapless robbers take refuge in the home of DeWayne's sister Crystal, proceeding to squander most of the robbery money on drugs.  One evening, Leonard answers the doorbell to find the Oxendines waiting outside.  Right on the Oxendines' heels is Keller, who has also tracked the Puryears to their hideout.  A vicious firefight breaks out, forever altering the lives of those involved.  The remainder of the novel deals with the surviving parties' dogged pursuit of one another, some seeking a payday, others revenge.  The chase is not without its interesting detours; the consequences and the final death toll won't become apparent until the final pages.<br /><br />Rhoades knows how to keep an audience's attention, never stinting on the well-choreographed action.  Surprising for a novel that relies so much on explosive set pieces, however, is that it doesn't neglect character development; each player is profoundly affected by the violence that surrounds them.  The winning mix of pulse pounding action and intriguing central characters will have readers anxiously anticipating the author's next offering.	2005-03-15

After seeing consulting with countless mental health professionals and consuming numerous medications in an effort to ease his pain, Scott has seemingly finally settled down with his wife Gayle and child David, pursuing a career as a true crime journalist.<br /><br />Lately, however, Scott has been subject to sudden rages, episodes which have resulted in his estrangement from his wife.

His probe into her presumed kidnapping leads him into unexplored territory, as he encounters a mysterious teenager who, coincidentally, goes by the name of Miranda.  Scott feels a powerful attraction to the girl, who introduces him to strange shadow worlds existing just beneath the fabric of our own reality.  Scott doesn't realize it, but he's being groomed to accept and fulfill a strange and dangerous destiny.<br /><br />LIKE DEATH is a book which will probably provoke extreme reactions in readers, as Waggoner, who obviously enjoys pushing the envelope, sometimes strays over the boundaries of good taste; some may abandon the book in a fit of anger at the sheer outrageousness of some of the set pieces he offers, in particular a surreal scene set in a children's playground early on in the book.  There's no need to go into the particulars of that scene, only to comment that what some might see as daring and unconventional, others might find offensive or just plain stupid.<br /><br />That's not to say that the scene is gratuitous, only that Waggoner could have achieved the effects he sought in another manner.  The author's choice to go in that direction, however, proves to be only a small distraction in an otherwise smooth read.  The book's definitely worth sticking with, delivering plenty of chills and thrills as it moves to its satisfying and unconventional conclusion--as far out as some early portions might be, Waggoner is careful to leave none of his numerous plot threads dangling.<br /><br />Boiled down to its essentials, LIKE DEATH provides a unique take on a hero's journey, as Scott discovers his purpose in life.  Although a bit overlong, and sometimes exasperating, the book's original take on this familiar premise, coupled with the freshness of Waggoner's outr&eacute; imagery, makes for engrossing reading.The book's definitely worth sticking with, delivering plenty of chills and thrills as it moves to its satisfying and unconventional conclusion--as far out as some early portions might be, Waggoner is careful to leave none of his numerous plot threads dangling.

Learning of each other's existence, they decide to strike back at their tormentor, luring him to an underground parking lot where they shoot him several times, then flee, leaving him for dead.  Their troubles are only just beginning, though, as Gideon, who is far more resilient than they expect, launches a bloody supernatural campaign of revenge against them.<br /><br />FEAR ME (originally published as GIDEON in 1993) provides an intriguing take on the vampire myth, positing a creature that feeds on his victims' life forces, rather than on their blood, leaving them wizened husks.  Like a traditional vampire, Gideon has also achieved a form of immortality.  Every twenty years or so, he impregnates several women, who bear children who, upon reaching young adulthood, seek each other out and literally battle each other to the death for the privilege of becoming the next vessel to house his essence.<br /><br />Laws structures his book around these essential differences, alternating between Gideon's pursuit of the three women and the troubles of a young man named Paul Shapiro, who belatedly discovers that he is one of the succubus' progeny.  These two plotlines eventually converge, as Paul is forced to confront his true father to save one of the women Gideon has victimized.<br /><br />Along the way, Laws relates some terrifying and harrowing set pieces guaranteed to set readers' nerves jangling.  Scary, smart, and edgy, FEAR ME is a horror novel that doubles as a thriller, a prime example of dynamic, purposeful storytelling.	2005-03-03

Its protagonist is the luckless Davey Owens, who, as the book begins, has just lost his job and his girlfriend. Seeking distraction from his problems, he drifts down to the seedy environs of 42nd Street, entering an establishment called Live Girls.  There, he falls under the sway of the vampire Anya, who sustains herself by taking blood from clients who pay her for oral sex. At first seduced by the new life she offers him, Davey later turns against her, resulting in a bloody, violent and, ultimately, explosive confrontation with Anya and her extended vampiric family.<br /><br />Originally published by Pocket Books at the end of the \\"horror boom\\" of the late 1980s, Garton's novel was described in blurbs as \\"The most nightmarish vampire novel I have ever read\\" by Ramsey Campbell, and as \\"gripping, original, and sly\\" by Dean Koontz, making it a true rarity, a novel that nearly lives up to the expectations created by its effusive cover copy.  Intense and graphic, LIVE GIRLS is truly a must read for horror fans.	2005-02-10

Offered a full pardon for past crimes if he'll cooperate with US Intelligence, New York mob hitman Paul Schumann agrees to undertake a dangerous assignment, the assassination of military man Reinhard Ernst, a key official of Adolph Hitler's Third Reich.  Adopting the identity of a US journalist traveling to Berlin to cover the 1936 Olympics, Schumann slips into Germany and begins to prepare for the hit.  His mission is threatened from its very infancy, however, as things start to go wrong for him even as he boards the boat to Europe.  Plagued by the actions of enemies in the US as well as the Fatherland, Schumann quickly learns the only person he can depend on is himself.<br /><br />Although it's somewhat of a clich&eacute; to say that a novel will keep you guessing until the final scene, this is the literal truth about Garden of Beasts, as Deaver dashes all expectations.  As is the case for Deaver's sympathetic anti-hero Paul Schumann, readers are not permitted to take anything for granted--nothing is as it seems, and no one can be trusted.  Deaver's machinations seem limitless; readers will experience several thrilling moments of frisson when they tumble to the fact that some new revelation is forthcoming.<br /><br />The well researched Garden of Beasts (Deaver makes appropriate use of German idioms, and is spot on in his rendering of his German characters' halting English) is a top drawer thriller, not surprising given that it comes from the same man who has given us such memorable books as The Bone Collector, The Coffin Dancer and The Empty Chair.  Chief among its many virtues are its swift pacing and a vivid recreation of the fear and paranoia so rampant in 1936 Berlin.  What makes the book truly memorable, however, is Deavers' splendid evocation of the complexities of the human animal.  A stone cold killer capable of sudden brutality, Schumann morphs into a sympathetic hero.  His relentless pursuer, German policeman Willie Kohl, proves even more likeable--even though he's after the hero of the piece, readers will view him as an honorable man.  More intriguing still is Deavers' characterization of Reinhard Ernst, doting grandfather, bereaved father, and loyal soldier.  Although not an admirer of Hitler, Ernst is motivated by a deep love of country.  Readers will be astonished by where his highly developed sense of duty ultimately leads the old soldier.n though he's after the hero of the piece, readers will view him as an honorable man.

Thus, her friends breathe a sigh of relief when she becomes preoccupied with a new client, Charlotte Bannister Muravieff.  A member of a wealthy Alaskan family, Muravieff wants Kate to gather evidence to help clear her mother, Victoria, who was imprisoned for the murder of her son William some thirty years prior.  Unable to turn down the large fee the woman offers, Kate begins her investigation of what she quickly realizes is no ordinary cold case.<br /><br />Fourteen installments in, Stabenow's Kate Shugak series remains fresh and engaging.  Shugak is an impressive leading lady, an aggressive, capable, tough as nails heroine who somehow also manages to endear herself to most everyone she encounters.  Stabenow has also created an impressive supporting cast for Kate to interact with, from her sage uncle Old Sam, to her lovable dog Mutt, to her romantic conquest, the increasingly enamored lawman Jim Chopin.  All bring out different sides of Stabenow's multifaceted protagonist, as well as providing frequent comic relief.<br /><br />It's a winning mix, one that's only enhanced by the intriguing mysteries Stabenow has concocted for Kate over the years.  If you haven't experienced the charms of this series as yet, A Taint in the Blood is as good a place as any to start.	2005-01-13

Although pleased with the honor, Parker finds it a little disorienting to be back in his old stomping grounds.  His confusion grows when he finds himself the chief suspect in the murder investigation of his boyhood Jerome Crowe, pursued by old associate Michael Mangan, an FBI agent with whom he's always had an uneasy relationship.  Caught up in a game where sudden death is a consequence of failure, Parker strives to find the real killer even as the authorities continue their relentless pursuit.<br /><br />Although the  \\"accused-of-a-crime-he didn't -commit\\" is one of the oldest plots in the genre, Mitchell manages to give it a new spin by again exploiting Parker's insular world, that of the Native American, which allows him to explore issues and concerns unique to that community.  As in previous works, Parker is again forced to wrestle with the fact that he is part of two cultures--attempting to evade capture in the outside world, he gets in closer touch to his Comanche heritage.<br /><br />The decision to focus almost entirely on Parker yields substantial dividends, and augers well for future installments in the series.  Book by book, Mitchell has been painting an intimate portrait of Parker, a tough, complex and conflicted man.  It should be interesting to see what Mitchell has in store for his hero next.	2005-01-07

On the other hand (especially if you're one of King's devoted Constant Readers), you might feel the need to immediately begin rereading the seven-volume series in order to relive what you no doubt considered a pleasant experience (a desire in keeping with the spirit of King's ending, in which we learn that ka really IS a wheel).<br /><br />If you fall into the second category, allow me to suggest a pleasant appetizer to precede your literary repast, Bev Vincent's perceptive book-by-book analysis of King's Gunslinger books, titled THE ROAD TO THE DARK TOWER.  A thorough, eminently readable exploration of King's fantasy epic, THE ROAD TO THE DARK TOWER combines telling insight with a true fan's appreciation of the series, and will surely enhance your enjoyment of subsequent re-readings.<br /><br />Vincent adopts a systematic approach to his analysis, initially providing a brief factual history of the series, from its origins during King's college days to the publication of the final volume of Roland's story on King's birthday on September 21, 2004. Finishing that, he proceeds to discuss each successive volume of the series, offering detailed synopses of each work.  Further up the \\"Road,\\" Vincent offers chapters on \\"Related Works,\\" \\"Dramatis Personae,\\" \\"Epics, Influences and Ka,\\" and \\"Art and the Act of Creation.\\"  He finishes strongly with a chapter entitled \\"Magnum Opus?\\" which attempts to put the Dark Tower series in perspective against King's entire body of work, followed by several useful appendices.<br /><br />Vincent is respectful of his subject matter, but never fannish in his commentary; his affection for his subject matter is evident, but never becomes mawkish. The book, which exhibits the respected journalist's deep knowledge of all things King, also is noteworthy for the fact that Vincent had King's cooperation, allowing him to explore avenues that were closed off to other essayists. In the end, the only criticism one can level at the book is the absence of a detailed index, a virtual requirement for a work such as this whose reason for being lies in its examination of even the smallest of details.  It's a flaw that can be forgiven, however, in light of the pleasurable reading experience this book provides to Dark Tower fans.is commentary; his affection for his subject matter is evident, but never becomes mawkish.

US	52836712	R2A06SBSFD63BZ	1400062527	623020428	In the Night Room	Books	5	24	31	N	N	The haunting of Tim Underhill	Like the jazz musicians he favors, Peter Straub has always displayed a penchant for digging deep into his art, examining the tales he tells from several angles, experimenting with their basic components and rhythm.  This literary improvisation plays a large role in his classic THE THROAT, which revisited characters, events, settings and themes previously treated in KOKO and MYSTERY, all in an attempt to uncover the \\"real\\" story of the Blue Rose Murders, killings which occurred in Millhaven, WI, the author's fictional recreation of his hometown of Milwaukee. It also plays a large part in Straub's latest, IN THE NIGHT ROOM.<br /><br />Straub sent his alter ego (and sometimes collaborator) Tim Underhill back to Millhaven in 2003's LOST BOY LOST GIRL, a haunted house/serial killer/ghost story which netted the author both a Bram Stoker and an International Horror Guild Award for best novel.  In that book, readers saw a melancholy Underhill struggling to cope with his beloved nephew's apparent death; attempting to assuage his profound grief, he pieces together a supernatural explanation to account for the boy's disappearance.  In IN THE NIGHT ROOM, we discover that the events of LOST BOY LOST GIRL still haunt Underhill, but not in the way one might expect.  LOST BOY LOST GIRL, it now appears, was the novel Underhill wrote to cope with the experience, featuring a character named Tim Underhill.  Underhill's fictional vision is so powerful, however, that it resonates in another dimension, where Joseph Kalendar, the deceased serial killer who figured so prominently in LOST BOY LOST GIRL, reads the \\"perfect\\" version of the novel, becoming maddened and enraged over Underhill's portrayal of his daughter Lily.<br /><br />Kalendar is so affronted by this perceived injustice that he reaches out from beyond the grave to strike at his tormentor; Underhill thus finds himself desperately trying to set things right in order to stave off the killer's increasingly devastating attacks.  Complicating his already complex existence, another rent in the fabric of reality produces a truly fantastic traveling companion for Underhill, young adult author Willy Bryce Patrick, whose true origins won't be revealed here for fear of reducing the impact of the surprises Straub has in store for his audience.  Thrown together, the duo comes to realize that some debts are so steep they require the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />IN THE NIGHT ROOM is beautifully written, boasting Straub's characteristic inventiveness and humor.  A deep affection for his varied cast is also evident.  Tim Underhill and Willy Patrick are especially captivating, as is book collector Jasper Dan Kohle, Straub's most menacing villain since GHOST STORY's Gregory Bate (yes, even more loathsome than Dick Dart!).  Straub toys with several compelling notions in this novel, among them the \\"Borgesian\\" idea of the \\"real book\\" (\\"The one you were supposed to write, only you screwed it up.\\"), a creator's love for his creations, and the power of fiction to make sense of reality.  As Straub writes of Underhill, \\"Tim Underhill was like a kind of Scheherazade, telling stories to save his life.  Fiction gave him entry into the worst and darkest places of his life, and that entry put the pain and fear and anger right in his own hands, where he could transform them into pleasure.\\"  One suspects this is much the way Straub feels about writing himself.<br /><br />The novel also adds to the list of fictional novels that you wish you had a chance to read, Straub being responsible for more than a few of these over the years.  Now, in addition to books like Underhill's THE DIVIDED MAN (first mentioned in KOKO), Don Wanderley's THE NIGHTWATCHER (from GHOST STORY), and Hugo Driver's NIGHT JOURNEY (the fantasy novel at the heart of THE HELLFIRE CLUB), you'll find yourself longing to read Willy Bryce's third YA novel, the Newberry Award winning IN THE NIGHT ROOM.  Unfortunately, that's a possibility that's not likely tomaterialize in this reality.  Perhaps, though, in another?not likely to materialize in this reality.

Revisiting the locale and characters that made his first novel, FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES so memorable, Andrew Fox conjures an even more intriguing adventure for his corpulent bloodsucker, Jules Duchon.  This time out, Jules is bullied by the vampire elders of New Orleans (known as the \\"High Krewe of Vlad Tepes\\") into investigating a series of attacks against their clan, serial dismemberings that have left the unfortunate immortals comatose, sans various appendages.  To expose this new evil, Jules must team with long time allies (Doodlebug Richelieu, his transsexual prot&eacute;g&eacute;), bitter enemies (Preston, a member of his nemesis' Malice X's posse), and new friends (rat expert and transplanted Californian, Daphne Petruko).  Complicating matters, Jules continues to seek a way to resurrect Maureen, his murdered vampiric paramour, even as he pursues his unorthodox investigation.<br /><br />Fox trods familiar territory in BRIDE; indeed, much of what powered the first novel (mainly Fox's sense of place, and his affection for his cast) drives the second.  But in BRIDE, readers find themselves in the hands of a more experienced, more confident storyteller, one who writes with considerably more assurance and panache.  Striking a delicate balance between horror, humor, and pathos, Fox takes his fat white vampire on a rollicking, frightening adventure, all the while honoring, updating, and poking sly fun at the hoariest of horror movie and mystery novel clich&eacute;s.  Readers will find themselves alternately laughing and shuddering, sympathizing with even the oddest of motivations Fox provides for his quirky cast.  He also expertly toys with his audience's expectations.  The author has numerous surprises up his sleeve, and, even if they guess early on whodunit, the \\"why\\" behind the perpetrator's deeds will still leave readers shaking their heads.<br /><br />It's fitting that in a summer blessed by a couple of truly excellent movie sequels (Shrek II and Spider-Man II), Fox turns the same trick with this follow-up to FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES.  Based on the quality of this sequel, and on Fox's keen awareness of the traditions of the horror genre, can HOUSE OF THE FAT WHITE VAMPIRE and GHOST OF THE FAT WHITE VAMPIRE be far behind?  One hopes so.the same trick with this follow-up to FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES.

US	52836712	R1ZK27EEGMOICQ	0312286449	862049541	Desert Places	Books	4	40	43	N	N	Intense	Robert Frost's poem provides a title and an epigram to this engrossing first novel, the pulse pounding tale of an outwardly civilized man forced into acting in an uncivilized (to say the least) manner.  That man is Andrew Thomas, best selling author of suspense novels with titles like Blue Murder and The Scorcher.  Thomas lives the good life until the day he receives a letter in the mail, telling him that a woman's body has been buried on his property, a body soaked in the author';s blood.  Confirming this sad fact, Thomas is forced to play his tormentor's twisted game, one which requires him to make a journey to Wyoming, where he ultimately must confront his own mortality, and question his morality and sanity.  Thomas confronts a question most never have to face:  just how far is he willing to go to survive?  The answer is as disturbing to him as it will be to readers.<br /><br />Desert Places is one of those books that you don't discuss in detail with those you recommend it to for fear of diminishing the impact the book will have on them.  It's also the kind of book which induces those who have already read it to stand over the shoulder of current readers, asking, \\"\\"Did you get to the part where...?\\"  Because of that, it is almost criminal to reveal further plot points.  Suffice it to say that Crouch successfully manipulates plot elements previously explored in such classic thrillers as James Dickey's Deliverance and David Morrell's Long Lost, producing a novel whose intensity is sometimes almost too hard to take.  Fast paced, surprising, at turns tragic and graphic, Desert Places will take readers to places that, given a choice, they'd probably avoid.  Finding themselves in those places via Crouch's surprisingly accomplished prose, however, they can't help but linger a bit, looking over the grim landscape in morbid fascination.	2004-09-22

Doing so, he takes readers on a frenetic literary ride, repeatedly cutting in time from 1964 to 2004 and back, never once dropping any of the myriad balls he so fearlessly tosses into the air.  Long time fans of the series won't be disappointed (this reviewer particularly enjoyed the cameos by Agent Mahoney, who Serge drove into an institution).  Those new to the continuing and varied Serge saga will quickly adapt to the chaos.  You might be a little winded upon finishing, but this book's worth the fatigue.	2004-09-22

Wright's COMIC BOOK NATION, to Les Daniels' histories of Marvel, DC, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.  All serve to address the prior dearth of scholarship in this area.  Now, journalist Ronin Ro has turned his eye to chronicling the Marvel Age of Comics in TALES TO ASTONISH:  JACK KIRBY, STAN LEE, AND THE AMERICAN COMIC BOOK REVOLUTION.<br /><br />It's about time we got a book on Marvel that wasn't a pure PR job, such as Stan Lee's own Origins of Marvel Comics series, or even the Lee biography by Jordan Raphael and Tim Spurgeon.  To tell the story, Ro takes readers back to the early days of comic books, when Marvel was known as Timely Publications, beginning with the story of comic's artist Jacob Kurtzberg, who later changed his name to Jack Kirby.  At Timely, Kirby teams with Joe Simon to create Captain America, a major moneymaker for the company during WWII.  He also meets the publisher's wife's cousin, Stanley Lieber, known to comic fans as Stan Lee.  Ro then follows their respective careers from the fabulous Forties through the lean years of Fifties and early sixties (when the two cranked out giant monster stories for the Atlas anthology comics Strange Tales, Journey into Mystery, and, yes, Tales to Astonish), then into the Marvel Age of Comics, heralded by the duo's creation of The Fantastic Four in 1961.  Kirby's story, which constitutes  the bulk of the book, ends with his death in 1994; Lee's continues through today, with the advent of the two recent Spider-Man movies.<br /><br />If you're part of a certain age group (born from 1955 to 1965), TALES TO ASTONISH represents a pleasant trip down memory lane, gathering all the fanzine news items and convention panel gossip one has heard over the years in one place.  The writing is workmanlike; the reportage is balanced and respectful, obviously based on thorough research.  One gets the feeling the book could have easily been bigger--Ro covers the basics, and even offers up some new bits of information, but was either unable or unwilling to go into more detail, or to editorialize, which ultimately limits the book.  For instance, it would have been interesting for Ro to weigh in on the whole \\"Who Created the Marvel Universe\\" controversy, based on his research.  Instead, he maintains his distance, rarely interjecting his own opinions.  In the final analysis, however, the book's a great read, hopefully presaging further histories (one, Mark Evanier's in-progress Kirby biography, is something I've been looking forward to for quite some time now).  Ultimately though, it's a reminder that even biographies are a form of fiction, as they only represent one writer's distillation of the so- called \\"facts.\\"d and respectful, obviously based on thorough research.

Six and a half year old Sarah Sullivan is the focal point of many an argument between Jess, her overly protective mother, and Mike, her overly demanding father.  Fiercely independent, the little girl leans towards her father in these battles, which is why she's overjoyed to learn that Mike is taking her sledding despite Jess' fears.  The outing turns tragic, however, as Sarah is kidnapped shortly after Mike and she arrive at the sledding area.  After the first frantic weeks, it becomes apparent that Sarah won't be coming back.<br />Remembering Sarah sports a compelling premise enhanced by the presence of an equally compelling, emotionally tortured central character, Mike Sullivan.  In addition to confronting a parent's worst nightmare, Mike is forced to face his own human frailties, and to reevaluate his basic assumptions about the world he inhabits.  This slow, tortuous process almost destroys him, yet, in the end, proves his redemption, giving him the strength to face the stunning truths revealed to him over the course of the novel.<br />Successfully combining elements of Jacquelyn Mitchard's The Deep End of the Ocean and Dennis Lehane's Mystic River, the novel examines the bonds and responsibilities of marriage, parenthood and friendship, and the wounds people inflict on one another, both intentionally and unintentionally.  In the end, Mooney seems to suggest, it is how the offended party deals with those wounds that determines the course their lives will take.  Recovery is possible, but sometimes only through a superhuman act of acceptance, and through a willingness to see things as they truly are.	2004-07-14

Reminiscent of Manly Wade Wellman's John the Balladeer, Piccirilli's Necromancer wanders along the backroads of civilization, only pausing for occasional skirmishes with the forces of evil that lurk behind the surface of even the most innocent of facades. Accompanied by his wise-cracking familiar, the demonic Self, the Necromancer seeks out danger as a means of distracting himself from the memory of his deceased lover Danielle, who died ten years earlier in a mystic right gone badly wrong.<br />In this, his first novel length adventure (see Piccirilli's excellent collection, Deep Into That Darkness Peering for previous tales), the Necromancer finds himself caught up in the macabre activities of his former coven, led by his nemesis Jebediah DeLancre. DeLancre has an interesting proposition for the troubled mage-if the Necromancer assists the coven in forcing Christ's return to Earth, DeLancre will resurrect Danielle, whole and undamaged. Thus, he's forced to choose between the love of his life and triggering Armageddon.<br />Almost overwhelming in its vision and scope, A Lower Deep is a difficult, often exhausting, read. Bursting with incident, exposition, and myriad characters (living, dead, and living dead), it's a book that sometimes feels as if it was forcibly compressed into too small a package.  Whether this was a conscious decision on Piccirilli's part, or whether an editor forced it on him, the book could benefit from a little \\"seam letting,\\" allowing the author a little more latitude to tell his expansive tale.<br />One senses that Piccirilli was shooting for a literary version of Wagnerian opera.  Instead, the novel resembles nothing so much as a James Bond movie.  All the elements are there-a flashy opening sequence, the inevitable witty banter with a villain intent on wreaking global chaos (although the villain turns the tables on the Necromancer by telling him \\"You're insane.\\"), a globe hopping hero, and a final confrontation between enemies with nothing less than the fate of the world at stake-the Necromancer even drives a Jaguar!  As is often the case with a Bond film, its parts are more interesting than the whole, a shame because Piccirilli was obviously reaching for something more.  Although he creates some unique and disturbing set pieces along the way (the finale is spectacular), their power is diminished by the sheer amount of work readers must do to keep up.  In the end, Piccirrilli gets an \\"A\\" for effort, but a \\"B\\" for execution.thing less than the fate of the world at stake-the Necromancer even drives a Jaguar!

Leisure continues its tradition of reprinting some of the finest genre fiction of recent years, this time publishing a slightly different version of Elizabeth Massie's Shadow Dreams, a collection originally issued by Silver Salamander Press in 1996. Although Gary Braunbeck's powerful introduction is gone, three stories, written contemporaneously with the others in the collection, have been added.<br />A common theme running through this compelling volume is the way our family life shapes us, for better or worse. Ten of the seventeen stories in this volume deal with family motifs, running the gamut from the unsettling, but ultimately unconvincing &quot;Sanctuary of the Shrinking Soul, &quot; where the bizarre circumstances surrounding the death of a child still haunt her mother years later, to the superior &quot;Snow Day,&quot; in which a child dreads, rather than pines for, a day off from school. All deal with the very human need for family, even when a particular version of the family unit is nontraditional or decidedly dysfunctional. All are strangely touching and thought provoking.<br />Although she seems to prefer quiet horror, Massie can also hold her own with the more &quot;extreme&quot; writers in the genre. Prime examples of this ability are &quot;Dibs,&quot; in which youthful promises come back to haunt those who made them, &quot;Crow Cat Cow Child,&quot; where an animal rights activist's core beliefs are shattered, &quot;Damaged Goods,&quot; whose twist ending suggests that absolute power corrupts absolutely, &quot;Thundersylum,&quot; about the nature of fear, and &quot;Fisherman Joe,&quot; a tragic tale of death and bloody retribution.<br />The most moving pieces in the collection are &quot;I am Not My Smell&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Valley&quot;. Both deal with damaged human beings, who, for various reasons, have given up hope along with their sanity, only to have that hope renewed in bizarre ways. In &quot;I am Not My Smell,&quot; a bag lady discovers a new purpose in life, one which requires her to make the ultimate sacrifice so that another being may find happiness; &quot;Shadow of the Valley,&quot; depicts a prisoner in solitary confinement who unexpectedly finds redemption in the arms of a gentle woman thrust into his cell by a sadistic guard. In each, Massie shows seems to say that even at life's lowest moments, fate often finds a way to bolster our courage, to allow us to hang on long enough to do what we have to do.<br />There are greater and lesser stories here, times when the climax of a particular story doesn't entirely satisfy. But at its best, Shadow Dreams celebrates the commonplace and the fantastic, subtlety and shock. Reading the stories in this collection creates a longing for more--hopefully, Massie will accumulate enough material for another collection sometime soon.iscovers a new purpose in life, one which requires her to make the ultimate sacrifice so that another being may find happiness; &quot;Shadow of the Valley,&quot; depicts a prisoner in solitary confinement who unexpectedly finds redemption in the arms of a gentle woman thrust into his cell by a sadistic guard.

US	52836712	R1XOIY3PV9C77O	159606000X	956877004	Nightscape	Books	5	15	15	N	N	A welcome companion volume to 1992's Black Evening.	Except for the novels The Totem, Testament, and Long Lost, David Morrell has chosen the short story as his primary vehicle when exploring the horrific.  Many of these outstanding shorter works were collected in 1992's Black Evening. Now, that volume has a welcome companion, Nightscape.<br />Although the stories in each display Morrell's trademark \\"you are there\\" immediacy, each book has its own unique qualities. Black Evening is a collection of stories that initially saw print between 1972 and 1992, while most of the stories in Nightscape were published during the past decade. The stories in Black Evening tend toward the supernatural, whereas those in Nightscape are more realistic. Finally, whereas the stories in the former vary in length, running the gamut from short stories to novellas, the pieces in the latter are mostly very long. In fact, &quot;If I Should Die Before I Wake&quot; and &quot;Rio Grande Gothic&quot; are almost mini-novels.<br />In his intimate introduction, Morrell explains that the stories in Nightscape consider the themes of obsession and determination. While those elements play varying roles in each tale, an even deeper theme, that of individual identity, ties these stories together. It's a prominent theme of \\"Remains To Be Seen,\\" where the protagonist sees himself as a loyal servant, willing to do whatever it takes to fulfill his promise, \\"Nothing Will Hurt You,\\" which focuses on a father who feels he has not met his responsibilities to his murdered daughter, and \\"Elvis .45,\\" in which a rabid fan of \\"The King\\" loses himself in idol worship.<br />This motif presents itself repeatedly in the remaining stories. In \\"Habitat\\" and \\"Front Man,\\" the protagonists struggle merely to maintain their identities. In \\"Resurrection,\\" the main characters redefine themselves to cope with radically changed circumstances.  Finally, in \\"If I Die Before I Wake\\" and \\"Rio Grande Gothic,\\" the characters' professions, physician and lawman, respectively, dictate their responses to extraordinary circumstances.<br />Writing with clarity and intensity, Morrell uses these tales to explore a wide variety of emotions and behaviors, including devotion, betrayal, grief, joy, and, yes, obsession and determination. Unsettling but also moving, the stories in Nightscape are yet another reminder of Morrell's ability to peer deeply into his characters' psyches, a rare talent that makes his work essential reading for horror fans and general audiences alike.eir responses to extraordinary circumstances.   <br />Writing with clarity and intensity, Morrell uses these tales to explore a wide variety of emotions and behaviors, including devotion, betrayal, grief, joy, and, yes, obsession and determination.

I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy...&quot;<br />-from Hamlet, by William Shakespeare<br />In this gargantuan novel, Infinite Jest is the title of a movie so enthralling it leaves viewers mesmerized, unwilling to wrest their gaze from the screen. Audiences don't care about anything else, and literally die of pleasure (the descendant of Monty Python's Killing Joke, perhaps?).<br />Infinite Jest (the novel) is set approximately two decades in the future, and deals with a society obsessed with entertainment and amusement. The former NAFTA states have been reorganized as the Organization of North American Nations, or ONAN. The President of the United States, the titular leader of ONAN, is a somnambulant ex-crooner named Johnny Gentle, who's most original idea is to offer large corporations sponsorship opportunities-thus, each year is now named for a commercial product, resulting in the Year of the Whopper, the Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar, and the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, during which most of the novel is set.<br />ONAN is under siege from wheelchair bound Quebecois terrorists, who are pissed that their province is now used as a toxic waste dump (the waste is hurled there from Massachusetts by giant catapults). Their master plan: obtain a copy of the lethal movie (code named &quot;the Entertainment&quot;), and make it available for the mass consumption of the largely lethargic American populace.<br />Searching for the master copy of the film, the terrorists focus on the sons of the film's deceased autuer, J. O. Incandenza, Jr. (who committed suicide by sticking his head in a specially rigged microwave oven shortly after completing the film). Icandenza's progeny are Orin, a skirt chasing professional football player, Mario, mentally deficient and physically deformed, and Hal, a brainy tennis star at the Enfield Tennis Academy, an institution his father founded before embarking on his film career.<br />The majority of the action in the novel takes place at the Enfield Academy and at Ennet House, a rehab center located just down the block from the tennis school. These institutions yield dozens of humorous asides and a plethora of quirky, memorable characters. Enfield provides opportunities to comment on celebrity and obsession, while Ennet House gives Wallace a chance to hold forth on addiction, self control, and Alcoholics Anonymous.<br />Wallace's primary theme is that America is slowly amusing itself to death. Obsessed with entertainment and self gratification, America is sliding into the abyss. Are there answers to this dilemma? Wallace seems to think so, constantly emphasizing the need to balance freedom with authority (his admiration for AA is obvious). Yet, he demonstrates that no answer is perfect: witness Lenz, in rehab to kick a drug habit, responding to the rigid structure of AA by killing domestic animals (you'll never hear the word &quot;There&quot; again without thinking of him).<br />Reading Infinite Jest is an ambitious undertaking. Don't be intimidated by its size (the hardcover weighed in at 3.3 pounds)-just be sure to set aside a few weeks to get through the thing. An unabridged dictionary and Physician's Desk Reference will also come in handy, as five dollar vocabulary words and pharmacological references abound. (And I haven't even mentioned the footnotes.) The original manuscript was reportedly some 300-500 pages longer and in need of severe editing, which may explain why the narrative just seems to end. The abrupt ending need not discourage you, however, as obsessive readers have reported that the novel is recursive, appropriate in light of its title.<br />Witty and deep, Infinite Jest is science fiction in the vein of John Barth's Giles Goat Boy or Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, a massive showcase for Wallace's writing talent, intelligence, and oddball sense of humor. Is it the great American Novel? Beats me. Some critics compare it to Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, but they say that about any book over 600 pages that you actually have to think about (I find it ironic that critics cite a book few have read to explain a book that even fewer will have the patience to read). Is it funny, erudite? Yes. Is it worthy of your attention? Most definitely. But be warned, Wallace's writing is as addictive as the movie Infinite Jest-- you may experience withdrawal pains upon finishing.pare it to Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, but they say that about any book over 600 pages that you actually have to think about (I find it ironic that critics cite a book few have read to explain a book that even fewer will have the patience to read).

US	52836712	R3LCTRLZQSXIN3	0375414533	11218727	Sunset and Sawdust	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Another memorable visit to East Texas.	With Sunset and Sawdust, Lansdale's readers find themselves revisiting the familiar terrain of East Texas, a region which the author has evoked with much intimacy and affection in novels like Mucho Mojo and Rumble Tumble.  Set in the lumber town of Rapture, Texas, the novel begins as its heroine, the fetching Sunset Jones, shoots her husband Pete in the head with his own .38.  Pete, a man who was a little too fond of beating and raping his wife, dies with a surprised look on his face, his ass in the air, and his pants around his ankles.<br />Receiving unexpected moral and political support from her mother in law Marilyn, who feels partially responsible for her son's vile behavior, Sunset is appointed to serve the remainder of Pete's term as Constable of Rapture.  Assisted by the plain spoken Clyde, and the handsome and mysterious drifter Hillbilly, Sunset finds herself at the center of a murder mystery involving her husband's mistress and unborn child.  What follows is pure Lansdale, including a couple of beatings, a house fire, sweaty sex, gunplay, creepy villains (one of whom previously appeared in Lansdale's outstanding short novel The Big Blow), unexpected plot twists, and general mayhem.<br />Lansdale continues on his impressive upward climb of constant refinement and improvement, producing a book that exceeds the high expectations created by such previous successes as the Edgar Award winning The Bottoms and 2003's A Fine Dark Line.  In the hands of a lesser writer, the events depicted in Sunset and Sawdust might read like an over the top country soap opera, but Lansdale's distinctive voice, combined with his emotional wisdom and his abiding affection for even the most despicable of his characters, transforms these incidents into affecting drama.  Lansdale's wit has never been as keen, his insight into what makes his characters tick never deeper.  His prose shines-you often stop to laugh at or reflect on what you've just read.  Lines like \\"He was big enough to go alligator hunting with stern language,\\" or  \\"Flies were so thick on the front of his shirt they looked like a vest,\\" create indelible images that linger in memory.<br />In the final analysis, however, it's the distinct sense of place that Lansdale creates that really sells the story.  In Rapture, he's created a literary locale as vivid and unique as John Steinbeck's vision of Monterey, California, the setting for that author's famous novels Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday.  What makes the town memorable, aside from its colorful denizens and the odd happenings which occur there, is the sense that you've actually visited the place and experienced its charms first hand.  Finishing the book, you almost expect to find the sawdust that permeates the town's air on your clothing.o go alligator hunting with stern language,\\" or  \\"Flies were so thick on the front of his shirt they looked like a vest,\\" create indelible images that linger in memory.  <br />In the final analysis, however, it's the distinct sense of place that Lansdale creates that really sells the story.

The Coil of the title refers to a group of six international movers and shakers who use their considerable economic and political power to influence the course of world events.  To protect their identities, they somewhat immodestly use code names relating to the Titans of myth, referring to themselves as Cronus, Hyperion, Prometheus, Atlas, Ocean, and Themis.<br />Since the end of World War II, the group has made many momentous decisions affecting the fate of nations, including ordering assassinations when politically expedient.  Many of those killings were handled by the legendary international hitman known as \\"The Carnivore\\".  Now presumed dead, the assassin was rumored to have maintained extensive files on all his hits.  Thus, the Coil becomes extremely agitated when it appears that someone has gained access to those files, and is now using them to blackmail the Carnivore's former employers.<br />Painfully aware of what's at stake, the secret organization and other interested parties initiate a search for the blackmailer and the invaluable files in his/her possession.  A natural starting place is with ex-CIA agent Liz Sansborough, the Carnivore's daughter.  Firmly convinced that her life of intrigue is all in the past, Sansborough (who previously appeared in Lynds' 1997 novel MASQUERADE) is abruptly pulled back into the spy game, forced to seek the files to stay alive.  Her odyssey leads her into the murky world of espionage and intrigue, where one mistake could prove fatal.<br />Given her collaborations with the late Robert Ludlum (such as the \\"Covert One\\" novels THE HADES FACTOR, THE PARIS OPTION, and THE ALTMAN CODE), it's not surprising that THE COIL evokes the works of that internationally best-selling author, especially those written in his prime.  Lynds, however, manages to build on the work of her collaborator, updating his basic formulae for modern audiences.  Efficient and quick witted, Sansborough proves a worthy heroine.  Her companion, MI6 agent Simon Childs, proves equally adept.  Lynds pits the winning pair against several hostiles, constantly testing their mettle as they piece together a very complicated international puzzle.  A gripping read, the book seems like a natural property for a movie adaptation.  Sadly, Alfred Hitchcock, the one director best suited to bring this novel to the screen, is no longer with us.  Fortunately, Lynds has provided an eminently filmable blueprint that even the most inept director couldn't botch.Simon Childs, proves equally adept.

Exhibiting the same compelling, richly textured storytelling style displayed in Hirshberg's noteworthy debut novel, The Snowman's Children, The Two Sams features five novellas that work satisfying variations on familiar themes.  All are told in the first person.<br />The two most intriguing stories in the collection are the bittersweet title story, \\"The Two Sams,\\" and the surreal \\"Mr. Dark's Carnival.\\"  \\"The Two Sams\\" features a troubled husband reflecting on the two miscarriages his wife has suffered-the character's sense of loss is palpable, the climax is profoundly moving.  \\"Mr. Dark's Carnival\\" which, while evocative of Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is far, far darker, chronicles a college professor's disturbing Halloween encounter with a local legend.<br />Another tale set on Halloween night, \\"Struwwelpeter,\\" is about a haunted house and the allure it holds for a troubled teenager.  \\"Shipwreck Beach\\" is about the uneasy relationship between two cousins; as it's title indicates, it's about shipwrecks, both literal, and those some people make of their lives.  Finally, \\"Dancing Men\\" provides a sensitive yet simultaneously harrowing look at some fallout from the central tragedy of our age, the Holocaust.<br />The enthusiasm Ramsey Campbell displays for Hirshberg's work in his introduction is justifiable-truly an \\"original and considerable talent,\\" Hirshberg does indeed \\"bring enviable skills to his work,\\" such as a \\"stylistic precision that comes of loving language, an unerring eye for character and the moments that define or reveal it,\\" and \\"a keen sense not just of place but how light and the time of day transform his settings.\\"  As to Campbell's assertion that \\"history will hail him as a crucial contributor to the field,\\" only time will tell.  Based on the evidence in The Two Sams, the probability certainly seems high.	2004-04-20

Jim Thurmond, the man in the grave (actually a fall out shelter), is one of the last surviving humans in his small Virginia town.  Already at the brink of madness, Jim is pushed closer to the edge when his young son Danny, who, since their divorce, lives with Jim's ex-wife in New Jersey, calls him on his nearly drained cell phone, pleading for help.  Galvanized by his son's pleas, Jim vows to rescue him.  The remainder of the novel deals with Jim's odyssey across a shattered northeastern landscape, as he struggles to avoid the growing zombie army and protect the people who join him along the way.  It's a dangerous trek, full of unexpected threats and surprises.<br />Bristling with menace, The Rising borrows liberally from books and stories such as Richard Matheson's I am Legend, Stephen King's The Stand and The Mist, James Dickey's Deliverance, Jack Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and movies such as George Romero's Dead trilogy and the classic B-movie Invaders from Mars.  Although it wears its influences on its sleeve, The Rising also demonstrates a lot of creativity and energy, as in Keene's explanation for the zombies attack and existence.  Although fantastic, it's easier to accept than other rationales that have been offered in the past.<br />Besides coming up with his new rationale for the existence of the walking dead, Keene also manages to keep this warped road trip interesting, subjecting his sympathetic protagonists to a variety of dangers and perils.  Despite its derivative elements, and a use of \\"inside\\" jokes and references (Keene conspicuously drops the names and personas of folks prominent in the horror field into the narrative) that borders on the excessive, THE RISING is an interesting, solidly written tale, filled with memorable incident and compelling characters who evolve and change.<br />Does Jim Thurmond succeed in his quest?

Jules Duchon is a New Orleans freelance cab driver and vampire. He drives a Cadillac, which comfortably accommodates his 450 pound bulk. For decades,  Jules has been content to cruise the city, making meals of the occasional passenger or homeless person.  Although often depressed and lonely, Jules consoles himself with pleasant memories and his collection of blues records and vintage pulp magazines.<br />Jules' peaceful existence comes to an end the night he is  confronted by angry African American vampire Malice X, who issues him an ultimatum-limit his prey to the white population or suffer dire consequences. Unable to comply, Jules is eventually forced by X's minions to flee New Orleans. His comic adventures in exile and his defiant return to his hometown to confront his nemesis provide the backdrop for the remainder of the novel.<br />FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES is hands down one of the funniest novels you'll ever read, deriving humor from its clueless protagonist, its colorful and varied supporting cast, and from the mores and attitudes of gaudy New Orleans culture. Fox has created the perfect comic character in Jules Duchon, whose sloth, prejudices, outmoded ideas, and general stupidity expose him to increasingly outrageous predicaments. Along the way, Fox wreaks havoc with the notion of vampires as sexy creatures of the night,portraying them as essentially human, limited by the emotions and worries we all face.  Thus, instead of the smooth, confident Lestat, we have the inept, insecure Jules; instead of the frightening Claudia, we have the cross dressing Doodlebug. Where Rice's vampires are the masters of all they survey, Fox's have trouble mastering even their simplest of powers (Jules, for instance, cannot mesmerize his prey, he can only induce nausea.)<br />Seemingly deriving inspiration from novels as diverse as John Kennedy Toole's CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, Michael Chabon's THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY, Christopher Golden's OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS, Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE, FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES offers laughs on every page, even in the midst of harrowing action. Despite the fact that much of the humor is admittedly lowbrow, and that Fox's narrative exhibits many of the flaws endemic to any first novel, FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES is a comic gem, one of the most promising debuts in recent memory.opher Golden's OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS, Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE, FAT WHITE VAMPIRE BLUES offers laughs on every page, even in the midst of harrowing action.

Angela Toussaint has mixed feelings about the offer to buy her family home in Sacajawea, Washington. The property has been in her family for decades (her grandmother, Marie Touissaint, is a local legend).  It's also the place where her teenaged son, Corey, died two years earlier under suspicious circumstances (though his death was officially declared a suicide). Although she fled the house after the tragedy, she decides she must return to the home, known by the locals as \\"The Goode House,\\" before making her final decision.<br />On her return to Sacajawea, Angela slowly comes to realize that something strange and lethal is going on there, and that the Goode House is at the epicenter of the mystery. She investigates, hoping to uncover the source of misery that has plagued her family and the citizens of Sacajawea since her grandmother's time. Doing so, she stirs up vengeful ancient forces that seek her destruction.<br />As in previous novels, Due focuses intensely on family dynamics. Angela and her husband, Tariq, were having problems even before Corey's death. Negatively influenced by the entity that seeks retribution on Angela, Tariq later becomes a warped symbol of their failed marriage. Here, however, the focus is not so much on spouses as it is on the bonds between a mother and her child. Despite the intimacy inherent in that bond, mothers and children are often strangers to each other--Due seems to suggest that  complete understanding is beyond either party. Acceptance, however, can lead to greater affinity.<br />Due takes her time with her narrative, allowing for extensive development of her characters and painstaking stage setting. As in previous works, her characters stand out--she cares about the people who populate her novels, and is eager to explore their frailties and hidden strengths. Angela is the best example; an able, tough-minded heroine, her fears, doubts and motivations all ring true. Due also does a masterful job of maintaining readers' interest, using changes in perspective and point of view to gradually illuminate the book's central mysteries.<br />THE GOOD HOUSE shows Due to be a writer of great scope, depth, and empathy.

Its sentiments permeate much of his work, including the six stellar novellas that have been collected in White and Other Tales of Ruin.<br />Ruin is defined as \\"total disintegration, either physical, moral, social or economic.\\"  The concept is pervasive throughout these cautionary tales of quest and survival.  Tales dealing with quests include \\"Hell,\\" a modern day Inferno, detailing a man's search for his missing daughter, `Mannequin Man and the Plastic B**ch,\\" in which a synthetic man's love for another artificial life form may prove to be strong enough to change the world, and \\"From Bad Flesh,\\" in which the protagonist seeks a cure for the virulent disease that is slowly killing him.  Interestingly, \\"the Ruin,\\" Lebbon's term for \\"an ambiguous nasty fate that has befallen society,\\" provides the depressing backdrop for this tale.<br />\\"The Ruin\\" also precedes the events chronicled in \\"White,\\" the story of a group of friends under siege by forces they can't comprehend.  Other tales of survival include \\"The First Law,\\" in which shipwrecked sailors are attacked by an island that has evolved into a sentient entity, and the poignant \\"The Origin of the Truth,\\" in which nanotechnology has gone awry, threatening to wipe the entire planet clean.<br />There's a tension in each of these novellas, a tension arising from the conflicting emotions of hope and despair.

It's the voice that grabs you, that trustworthy voice, hypnotic and resonant, calm and reassuring.  The voice assures you that what you are about to read is the absolute truth, no matter how far afield Jack Cady ranges, no matter how fantastic the subject matter.  The voice is in especially fine timbre in his latest book, Ghosts of Yesterday.  Comprised of two long essays and nine short stories, the collection boasts some of Cady's best work.<br />For those who are comfortable jumping around the table of contents, read the essays (\\"Science Fiction, Utopia and the Spirit\\" and \\"On Writing the Ghost Story\\") before the fiction.  The essays lay bare many of Cady's thoughts and feelings about the nature of fantastic literature.  As such, they represent a virtual primer for the stories that follow, and will enhance your enjoyment of the book.<br />The stories predictably feature numerous ghosts, spirits and shades.  Standout efforts include \\"The Lady With the Blind Dog,\\" in which people who fail to pursue their dreams are forced to perform an odd, but vital, penance, \\"The Ghost of Dive Bomber Hill,\\" featuring a benevolent specter who turns lethal to protect the surviving members of his family, and \\"The Time That Time Forgot,\\" a lengthy, potent reflection on the agonies of war.  Also of note are \\"Jeremiah\\", the story of a bartender who is haunted by a simple question posed by a preacher, \\"Daddy Dearest,\\" in which a family is haunted by a reprobate father's ashes, and \\"Halloween 1942,\\" another tale about the cost of war.  The collection is rounded out by \\"Weird Row,\\" which points out the ridiculousness of owning ideas, and a handful of shorter, less ambitious pieces, all of which appear here for the first time.<br />In a recent interview, Jazz fiend Bill Cosby described his listening habits.  \\"This is the way I listen to music.  For three weeks in a row, it'll be nothing but Bud Powell.

Other than varied encounters with the supernatural, there are no obvious common themes running through the novellas offered in FOUR DARK NIGHTS.  Apparently given free reign, each author has chosen to pursue themes common to their own work, rather than using this forum to experiment with their fiction.  The results, for the most part, are competent entertainments, but each a far cry from the &quot;blood curdling&quot; visions promised by the book's jacket copy.<br />The collection opens with Bentley Little's disjointed prose experiment &quot;The Circle,&quot; perhaps the most confusing novella of 2002.  The fractured fairy tale's main focus is on the mayhem that ensues in a suburban neighborhood after two teenagers make a sacrifice at an urban witch woman's backyard shrine.  A la Pulp Fiction, however, the story is not told in sequence.  It has its moments (a baby who defecates diamonds and other valuable items is a real attention grabber), but readers will likely find their attention wandering at times.<br />In Christopher Golden's &quot;The Pyre,&quot; a young woman is convinced that she will be able to come to terms with her estranged father's death by carting his corpse to an isolated Maine island where she once witnessed a manifestation of the world beyond.  The evening, which begins with a grave robbery, ends tragically.  An exploration of the bonds between parent and child, &quot;The Pyre&quot; works only if you consciously ignore some of its more implausible elements.<br />If a walk on the wild side sounds intriguing, Tom Piccirilli's &quot;Jonah Arose&quot; is the story for you.  An attempt to paint a densely detailed landscape with words, this piece is bursting at the seams with bizarre images and lengthy digressions.  This tale, which probably would have worked better with some of the extraneous detail and exposition stripped away, concerns itself with a man searching for his kidnapped son.  The fact that the kidnapper is the child's grandfather adds gravity to the story; the child's condition, revealed at the end of the narrative, will likely haunt many readers.<br />The final, and most successful of the quartet, is Douglas Clegg's &quot;The Words,&quot; an artfully crafted tale of alienation and experimentation that seems to endorse the old adage to choose your friends carefully.  Mark and Dash are two teenagers originally thrown together because they are outsiders.  They learn to revel in their outsider status, constantly seeking new ways to enhance it.  This search leads them to explore &quot;the Nowhere,&quot; another aspect of reality.  Their attempts to enter and embrace this reality bring them closer to fulfilling their dark destinies.<br />Though supposedly linked by the fact that the events all take place in a single night, no obvious attempt was made to tie these stories together.  Such a device might have added an element of danger or even playfulness to the final output, with the writers working off of each other's ideas and situations.  Alas, this conceit was apparently not considered, leading to this somewhat more conservative compilation of<br />stand-alone stories.ity to the story; the child's condition, revealed at the end of the narrative, will likely haunt many readers.<br />The final, and most successful of the quartet, is Douglas Clegg's &quot;The Words,&quot; an artfully crafted tale of alienation and experimentation that seems to endorse the old adage to choose your friends carefully.

Luckily, the majority of us have had the chance to atone for and forget our youthful indiscretions. Brad Denning, however, has lived with his for over two decades. At age thirteen, Brad one day scolded his little brother Petey for being a pest, telling him to &quot;bug off&quot; and &quot;go home.&quot; Profoundly disappointed, Petey does just that, except he never made it home-his bike and baseball glove were found lying in the street just a few blocks from the Denning house.<br />Presumed kidnapped, Petey is never found. Brad moves on, becomes a successful architect and raises his own family, but still carries inside his profound guilt over Petey's disappearance. One day, a stranger claiming to be the long lost Petey enters his life.  Initially stunned by this development, Brad overcomes his doubts, and eventually embraces this man as his brother. His joy is short lived, however, as &quot;Petey&quot; shows another, decidedly more sinister side, attempting to murder Brad, and subsequently kidnapping Brad's wife and son. After a lengthy recovery period, Brad is told by the FBI that Petey's trail has gone cold. Having narrowly escaped death, the despondent architect vows to track Petey down, no matter what the cost.<br />A powerful reflection on love, loss, courage and despair, LONG LOST is a horror novel disguised as a thriller. Although he leads with classic revenge and chase motifs, Morrell's narrative also includes metaphorical monsters, tombs, even a haunted house. By telling his story in the first person, Morrell makes his readers vicariously experience Brad Denning's triumphs and tragedies, almost pummeling them with his conflicting emotions<br />of hope and despair, of love, and revulsion.<br />Brad's journey in search of Petey reveals as much about the hunter as it does the prey, as Brad comes to terms with the terrible forces that molded Petey into the monster he's become. Understanding Petey's twisted psyche and motivations does not lead the increasingly cold-hearted Brad to forgive him, however. Brad submerges certain aspects of his personality and uncovers others in his effort to save his family. Brutal, touching, and often horrific, LONG LOST is an example of classic storytelling from a writer who knows how to push readers' emotional buttons.psyche and motivations does not lead the increasingly cold-hearted Brad to forgive him, however.

Although his novels often include horrific elements, David Morrell rarely deals with the supernatural and macabre in his longer works. Rather, he explores those topics in his shorter work, such as those gathered in his 1999 collection BLACK EVENING. These well-crafted tales, written between 1971 and 1992, are ample credentials for recognizing Morrell's status among the modern masters of horror.<br />The stories selected for inclusion are presented in order of composition. In Morrell's words, they \\"wear their age well.\\"  \\"Tales of dark suspense,\\" he continues, \\"their approach is different from that of my international thrillers.  You won't find spies and round-the-globe intrigue here. What you will find are the stark emotions behind that intrigue: fear and trembling.\\"<br />Fear does indeed lurk at the heart of these stories, and in many<br />permutations. This may be fear for the safety of your loved ones (\\"The Dripping\\"), fear of being exposed as a fraud (\\"The Typewriter\\"), or the fear of being caught up in someone else's delusions (\\"But at My Back I Always Hear You\\"). Each successive story peers deeper into the dark, revealing just how close at hand it really is. Whether he is writing about an apocalyptic thunderstorm, a high school football team that owes its<br />success to an idol, or a town paralyzed with fear over the presence of a serial killer, Morrell writes with an edge of the seat immediacy, an urgency that communicates his characters' fears directly to his readers.<br />How good are these stories? Consider this: the majority found homes in the premier anthologies of the eighties and nineties, including WHISPERS, SHADOWS, NIGHT VISIONS, PRIME EVIL, and DARK AT HEART. If you question the judgment of experienced editors like Charles Grant and Douglas Winter, you can always find assurance in the fact that two of the stories \\"The Beautiful Uncut Hair of Graves\\" and \\"Orange is for Anguish, Blue is for<br />Insanity,\\" won Stokers for Best Novella.

Anyone who's spoken at length with David Morrell knows him to be<br />insightful, and seldom lacking for amusing anecdotes. The engaging former professor is a learned man, eager to impart the benefits of his considerable wealth of knowledge and experience to those who are interested.<br />In keeping with his reflective nature and his instinctive desire to educate, Morrell has penned a useful and entertaining combination memoir and self help book called LESSONS FROM A LIFETIME OF WRITING: A NOVELIST LOOKS AT HIS CRAFT. In its pages, Morrell taps four decades of writing experience for the benefit of aspiring writers. He thoroughly explores both<br />the act and the business of writing, methodically covering the basics of everything from plot construction to contract negotiation. Morrell truly believes that there is no such thing as a stupid question, as he painstakingly answers many inquiries that most writers impatiently dismiss out of hand. A good example is the oft asked, &quot;Where do you get your ideas?&quot; a question that seems to cause many writers physical pain. Always<br />the patient educator, Morrell takes the question seriously, detailing the method by which he transforms a kernel of an idea into an engrossing plot.<br />It's this attitude that distinguishes LESSONS from other writing guides, making this user-friendly tome an invaluable addition to anyone's library. Not so much a &quot;How To&quot; as it is a &quot;How I&quot; book, it provides insights into a working writer's mind and habits, showing how one author tackles problems and overcomes challenges. There is great inspiration and encouragement here for practicing writers and plenty of intriguing particulars for those who are merely fascinated by the writing process.	2003-12-05

You can almost feel King rounding the corner in WOLVES OF THE CALLA, gathering speed as he heads towards the long awaited conclusion of this massive epic. After three decades, the end is finally in sight.<br />In this fifth installment of King's DARK TOWER series, Roland and his ka-tet are still on the path of the beam. Their quest has led them to Calla Bryn Sturgis, an agricultural town beyond the forests of Mid-World and in the shadow of the ominous dark city of Thunderclap. As they approach the city, they are met by a group of desperate townspeople who beg them for help against a foe so implacable that many in the town have long since given up hope. Among this delegation is a familiar face from King's canon, the unfortunate Father Donald Callahan, former resident of Jerusalem's Lot,Maine.<br />The townsfolk of Calla fear an army of beings they refer to as wolves, which descends from Thunderclap once each generation to abduct their children. Not just any children, mind you, but one half of each pair of the twins who live there in surprising numbers.  Months after their abduction, the victims are returned to the village, robbed of some vital spark, doomed to grow into slow witted, short lived giants. Having seen signs that the wolves' next invasion is imminent, the people of Calla beseech the gunslingers to help them.<br />Bound by their code, the gunslingers have no choice but to cast their lot with the villagers. What follows is a period of preparation and soul searching, as hidden depths and hideous duplicity are discovered within the group. The day the wolves reappear, they find a newly defiant population, willing to do battle to protect their progeny, even if that entails the ultimate destruction of the entire village.<br />Always a powerful storyteller, King really hits his stride in WOLVES, which, as he acknowledges in an Author's Note, is essentially a western draped in the clothing of the fantastic. King works the tropes like a master, delivering a gripping and satisfying tale, simultaneously positioning his characters for the final battle to come. Along the way, he pays homage to several diverse works of fiction, among them THE LORD OF THE RINGS and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, further strengthening the links between this and past works, at one point dipping a toe into the murky waters of metafiction. A powerful new novel of blood, passion, and, in King's own parlance, resistance, WOLVES OF THE CALLA is winning entertainment from one of modern fiction's brightest lights.g and satisfying tale, simultaneously positioning his characters for the final battle to come.

An employee of Global Protective Services, Cavanaugh (an alias) is a special breed of bodyguard, a member of an elite group of highly trained professionals referred to as &quot;protectors.&quot; An ex-Delta Force officer, Cavanaugh has survived many life-threatening situations, relying on his wits, training, and an almost addictive need for adrenalin to give him an edge.<br />Cavanaugh's life changes forever the day GPS is hired by biochemist Daniel Prescott, supposedly to protect him from an international drug cartel that seeks the secrets behind a highly addictive substance he's created. After successfully extracting the paranoid scientist from the New Jersey warehouse where he has gone to ground, Cavanaugh and his colleagues escort him to a GPS hideaway. Shortly after they arrive, the GPS personnel find their facility under siege by an unknown but well armed (and apparently well briefed) paramilitary unit. Dropping out of sight during the melee, Prescott uses the knowledge he's gleaned from Cavanaugh's team to disappear.<br />Cavanaugh then learns the unsettling truth about Prescott--his real breakthrough involved the discovery of a compound that multiplies the physical effects of fear in humans, thus incapacitating them. Hoping to sell his product to the highest bidder, Prescott used GPS to elude operatives of the US government and its rivals, who seek to exploit the obvious military potential of his invention. Outraged by Prescott's lethal duplicity, Cavanaugh vows to track him down.<br />Competing with others who seek both Prescott's invention and his hide, Cavanaugh's search is complicated when he is exposed to Prescott's fear agent--ironically, the fear junkie is now crippled by the emotion he formerly thrived on. His struggles to overcome this malady and capture his prey provide the meat of the rest of this fast paced, exciting novel.<br />THE PROTECTOR is a classic tale of revenge. David Morrell is in overdrive, as he deftly shifts from one action packed sequence to another, subjecting readers to all the twists and turns they've come to expect from him over the years, all the while doling out fascinating bits of tradecraft. The book moves at breakneck speed to an inevitable confrontation between Cavanaugh and Prescott, a meeting whose outcome will confound the expectations of readers who think they've figured out how everything will end.

Peter Straub returns to Millhaven, Wisconsin in this, his sixteenth novel. To complement the familiar locale, he's also chosen a familiar protagonist and narrator, his alter ego/collaborator, author Tim Underhill.<br />Tim returns to his hometown under grim circumstances, traveling to the Midwest to attend the funeral of his sister-in-law, Rachel. Wife to Tim's distant brother Philip, and mother of teenaged Mark, Rachel committed suicide by tying a plastic bag over her head and then slitting her wrists. Tragically, Mark was the one to discover her body.<br />The situation deteriorates further when Mark, who had been behaving strangely, disappears some two weeks later.  Local authorities conclude that Mark may have fallen victim to a serial killer who is using Millhaven and its environs as his stalking ground. Tim again returns to Millhaven, this time to aid in the search for his nephew. Assisted by long time friend<br />Tom Pasmore, Tim uncovers some truths he is loath to face.<br />Alternating between the first and third person, lost boy lost girl contains some of the most effective and moving writing of Straub's distinguished career. At once a mystery, ghost story, romance, and thriller, it's a resonant study of love, loss, grief, and regret. At the heart of the novel is the relationship between Tim and Mark--Mark representing to his Uncle the<br />son he never had. Like Mark, who became obsessed with an abandoned house and with his family's history, Tim becomes obsessed with his nephew, refusing to believe in the possibility that the boy's bright light may have been extinguished. As Tim pieces together the story of the events leading to Mark's disappearance, readers are presented with a dilemma: Has the<br />narrator, in his grief, become unreliable? Straub provides no easy answers, the book's ambiguous ending allowing readers to draw their own conclusions.<br />Skillfully mingling the familiar conventions of the horror and thriller genres with the larger, more ambitious visions of serious literature, Straub displays a delicate touch, a sharp eye for detail, and a deep understanding of the fragility and complexity of familial relationships.  Unsettling, elegiac, and memorable, lost boy lost girl may come to be regarded as a major turning point in Straub's career--spare and intimate, this outstanding effort may win him an even broader readership. That would certainly be a welcome development, both for the author, and for those yet to discover the magic of his prose.us visions of serious literature, Straub displays a delicate touch, a sharp eye for detail, and a deep understanding of the fragility and complexity of familial relationships.

Under the Overtree tells the story of Mark Howell, an awkward, overweight teenager, who, as 'the new kid in town', is a natural target for the bullies who plague his high school. Although Mark briefly manages to avoid the thugs, he is eventually cornered in a nearby wood and takes a savage beating. During the assault, he strikes his head on a stone; his blood spills over the stone, awakening 'the Folk,' a clan of supernatural beings who come to embrace Mark as 'the One.' They become his guardian angels, protecting him from harm, literally remaking him, increasing his physical and mental prowess and turning him into one of the most popular kids in school. But the Folk's intentions are not entirely charitable. In fact, they are molding Mark to suit their own dark purposes. Mark's ultimate fate is uncertain: unless his 'becoming' is halted, he may spend eternity as a pawn of his benefactors.<br />First novels are truly a mixed bag; reviewers can be awed and excited by unexpected brilliance or, just as often, bewildered by utter ineptitude. Fortunately, most efforts fall somewhere between these two extremes: unpolished, but competent and promising. Under the Overtree fits within this latter category...the book has a raw energy that keeps you turning pages. Part of this is due to Moore's great affinity for his characters-Mark Howell and the rest of the cast are vividly rendered. A great example of this is the colorful demon fighter John Crowley, who, despite his late entrance, manages to steal almost every scene he's in.<br />In brief, I recommend Under the Overtree for its story.  It's a gripping exploration of the old saw, 'Be careful what you wish for, because you just may get it.'	2003-07-27

Although it is populated mostly by plain, simple folk, it still has its share of colorful characters and bad apples. There is, however, very little about the town to distinguish it from its neighbors. At least that is the case until the Fourth of July, when an enormous alien spacecraft crashes in a local lake, vaporizing its contents and killing dozens of locals. That's the day the lives of the citizens of Collier change forever, in ways you might not expect.<br />This is not a novel of alien conquest, or even of alien contact. Eschewing predictable plot lines, Moore instead poses two simple questions, namely, \\"How would the federal government react in such a situation?\\" and, \\"Given that reaction, how would it affect the lives of the local populace?\\"<br />Moore provides a suitably chilling answer to these queries, positing a special branch of the armed forces created to handle just such a task, a grim cadre of soldiers dressed in high-tech body armor, their faces concealed by black visors. Immediately after the crash landing, these soldiers descend on Collier, cutting it off from the rest of the world under the pretext of battling terrorist activity. Their main objective: to secure the apparently inert craft. Their secondary objective: to maintain secrecy, even if it means killing everyone in the town.<br />This then is the focus of Moore's narrative, as he chronicles the reactions of everyday people to the invasion of their town by their own country. Although at first they are cooperative, the townspeople come to realize that they are in fact prisoners. Their resentment and anger grow by the day, building to a surprising crescendo. Moore populates his book with living, breathing characters, human beings on both sides of the conflict who, despite their fears, are only doing their best to cope with a stressful situation.<br />Moore is more in control of this narrative than he was of his prior effort, the flawed but highly readable Under the Overtree. The writing here is crisp and clear, the pacing is almost flawless, and, with the exception of the appearance of the spacecraft which triggers these events (its origins and purpose remain a mystery throughout), the subject matter is utterly believable and involving. Moore effectively milks the situation for all it's worth, filling the novel with telling incidents and detail, forcing readers to confront the brutal reality that true horror may lie in something as simple as losing the simple freedoms that Americans take for granted. A twisted combination of Sinclair Lewis' It Can't Happen Here and Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Fireworks is a great read, a book that merits your attention.he was of his prior effort, the flawed but highly readable Under the Overtree.

In 1890, Chicago's leading lights decided that the Windy City should take its rightful place among the world's greatest metropolises.  Thus, it would successfully compete with other American cities, such as its arch rival New York, for the privilege of hosting the next World's Fair, held in honor of the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America.<br />The burden of designing and building the fair fell mainly on renowned local architect Daniel Hudson Burnham.  Through a combination of grit, determination, and luck, Burnham achieved his goal, creating an exposition that many agreed had surpassed the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, for which the Eiffel Tower was erected (the Chicago venue boasted it's own architectural marvels, among them a giant spinning wheel designed by a man named Ferris).<br />Burnham's talent and drive to create were matched by another's man's lust to ... destroy.  While the fair rose in Jackson Park, serial killer H. H. Holmes (the inspiration for Robert Bloch's American Gothic) was building \\"The World's Fair Hotel\\", a personal charnel house containing a dissection table, walk in vault, greased wooden chute, gas chamber, and a 3000-degree crematorium.  No one can be sure, but some estimate that Holmes did away with upwards of two hundred unfortunate souls.<br />Horror fans should note that although the publicity for this book tends to emphasize the more sensational story of serial killer Holmes over that of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, Larson devotes far more time to the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of the Columbian Exposition than he does to the dastardly acts of Herman Webster Mudgett (Holmes' real name).  Overall, however, the author strikes an appropriate balance, as the alternating storylines prove an effective device in holding the reader's interest.<br />The Devil in the White City is bursting at the seams with splendid esoterica, as Larsen gives us not just the fair but the context in which to appreciate it, not just the sordid career of Holmes, but the details of his day to day existence, providing insight into his unique pathology.  The book's density of detail and thorough examination of its milieus does not, however, mean that narrative momentum is sacrificed to an immersion in the world Larson conjures.  Like his previous effort, the thoroughly researched and richly imagined Isaac's Storm, this engrossing history of late 19th century America has all the immediacy and punch of a well written work of fiction.  Like a good novel, it's rich in incident and telling details.  Its huge cast features two \\"larger than life\\" protagonists, and an expansive roster of supporting players that include the likes of Buffalo Bill Cody, Annie Oakley, Thomas Edison, Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B.

US	52836712	R34XCNZZ19BTOX	0375505296	518214282	The Dante Club: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	An impressive debut.	Pearl's debut is set in 1865 Boston, in and around Harvard University.  At the close of the Civil War, the campus is confronting changes wrought by current events and academic trends.  As the novel begins, the current hot-button issue is whether the works of Dante Alighieri are worthy of being taught at the University.  Several closed minded administrators consider his work blasphemy.  More liberal thinkers like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowe, who are championing the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy in America, think otherwise.<br />These notables, who gather as the \\"Dante Club\\" to translate the Divine Comedy, realize that the anti-Dante forces may yet hold sway.  Thus, one can imagine their dismay when they realize learn that a killer currently sought for the heinous murders of several prominent Bostonians has been inspired by images from the pages of Dante's Inferno.  Realizing that they would be considered prime suspects, the venerable group bands together to uncover the killer's identity.  Their investigations put their reputations and their lives in jeopardy.<br />Well written and carefully plotted, The Dante Club is an early contender for the best first novel of 2003.  Dante scholar Pearl does a terrific job of bringing his characters and 1865 Boston to life, so much so that readers can become lost in his narrative, forgetful of their own surroundings.  Particularly well rendered are Oliver Wendell Holmes and James Lowell, towards whom one gets the feeling the author harbored a special affection.  Pearl goes beyond relying on how these characters are portrayed by history, creating three-dimensional beings sure to engage and annoy his readers.  Pearl also makes telling points about racism, the ravages of war, and the intellectual hypocrisy that still plagues many of our institutions of higher learning even today.<br />That said, it's important to note that The Dante Club isn't Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Caleb Carr's The Alienist, or Mark Frost's The List of 7.  Perhaps because it tries to capture the essence of the era in which it is set, it lacks the dynamism or immediacy of those works; compared to them, it seems calm and mannerly, almost sedate.  But perhaps this contrast was Pearl's intent.  Regardless, his efforts have resulted in a thoughtful, accomplished mystery that should completely engage most readers, simultaneously stirring their interest in the canon of the man who's works inspired the novel, Alighieri Dante.rdinary Gentlemen, Caleb Carr's The Alienist, or Mark Frost's The List of 7.

Bored, and full of self-pity, he drifts into an affair with a woman whom he meets on his daily commute.  On the day they consummate their relationship things go badly awry, as they are accosted by an armed man in their hotel.  After being terribly beaten, Charles is forced to watch as the malefactor repeatedly rapes his paramour.  Subsequently, the man extorts money from Charles, threatening to expose his sordid secret.<br />For most of its length, Derailed renders a convincing portrayal of an ordinary man trapped in a nightmare, a man who is repeatedly made to pay, emotionally, physically and financially for his lack of judgment.  How much readers will enjoy it depends in part on how they would react in the same situation.  Those who would just come clean to their spouse may quickly lose all sympathy for Charles.  Those who would conceal their infidelity at all costs might find the story more convincing and engaging.<br />The novel takes a definite turn for the worse when Charles decides to fight back against his tormentor.  Although this satisfies readers' need to see justice done, it's here that the story becomes less and less believable.  For example, Charles escapes from certain death due to a bizarre and extremely unlikely coincidence, a prime example of \\"deus ex machina.\\"  If you can overlook missteps like this, Derailed should satisfy your thirst for, in the words of the publisher, \\"a highly charged, suspenseful tale of murder, betrayal and revenge.\\"  If you can't, dip into some James M. Cain, a writer who handled this type of plot with greater skill and aplomb.	2003-04-18

Reading about Clive Barker's polymathic inclinations, one recalls a scene from his book, The Great and Secret Show.  In that tale, postal worker Randolph Jaffe, assigned to the dead letter room, unwittingly finds himself at a spiritual crossroads of America.  Uncovering hidden truths by exploring the ramblings of the lost, the lonely, and the mad, Jaffe gets a glimpse of other worlds just under the surface of the \\"real\\" one.<br />Clive Barker has also glimpsed other worlds, but rather than driving him mad, these visions have compelled him to communicate what he has seen to others.  This compulsion has led him to express himself in a multiplicity of media, including the sketches he drew as a child (and indeed, throughout his life), the plays he wrote in his twenties, the short stories he penned as he matured, the movies he directed, or even now, in the portraits he paints.  It is this impulse that Douglas Winter, a polymath in his own right (lawyer, journalist, editor, author, book critic, public speaker), attempts to chronicle and explicate in The Dark Fantastic.<br />The book is arranged chronologically, following Barker from his early life in Liverpool, to his years on the London theatre scene, culminating in the present day, where we find him in Hollywood at work on his latest undertaking, the multimedia project known as The Abarat Quartet. Winter seems to have had unrestricted access to his subject and to those around him, as he cites knowledge gained from interviews with Barker and a plethora of Barker's family, friends, lovers, ex-lovers and business partners.  Although Winter makes no claim of objectivity, he maintains a respectable distance from his subject, providing valuable insights into both the man and his work.  Doing so, he makes a convincing case for Barker's inclusion in the pantheon of the leading creators of fantastic literature.<br />Perhaps the most important revelations are found near the end of the book, where Barker becomes more comfortable with his sexuality, finding true love with photographer David Armstrong.  There also, he deals with the death of his father and his subsequent descent into depression.  Barker's latest epiphany is the most fascinating, as he comes to realize that hundreds of paintings, seemingly created at random to combat his depression, all contained common themes, themes that eventually coalesced to form the basis of his Abarat Quartet project.  The fact that he unconsciously worked his way towards mental health, even while breaking new barriers, is both inspirational and awe inspiring.<br />The book's upbeat ending\\" (Barker's only fifty as of the publication date) bodes well for the future.  Barker, it seems, will continue to receive messages from other realities, filtering them through his artistic sensibilities to make them more palatable to us lesser mortals.  We, the audience, merely have to open our minds, experience his work, and learn. By allowing Barker to take us to other worlds, we can more easily absorb the lessons he has to teach us about our own.with his sexuality, finding true love with photographer David Armstrong.

Those who only know Rick Hautala as a novelist might be surprised to learn that he's a talented short story writer as well.  Ample proof is available in BEDBUGS, a collection of 26 tales of horror, suspense and the macabre.<br />One has to be impressed by Hautala's versatility.  Many of his short stories capture the style, feeling, and, sometimes, the very intensity of writers as diverse as Edgar Allen Poe (\\"The Back of My Hands\\"), Robert Bloch (\\"Colt .24\\"), Joe R. Lansdale (\\"... from a Stone\\") and Gary Braunbeck (\\"Schoolhouse\\"), even as he puts his own spin on the material.  Hautala's also proven that he can deliver even when constrained by narrow or quirky<br />themes, as in his stories originally written for theme anthologies.  Tales such as \\"Winter Queen\\" (from Dark Destiny), \\"Surprise\\" (The Ultimate Zombie), and \\"Piss Eyes\\" (Frankenstein: The Monster Awakes) demonstrate his consummate professionalism and extensive range.<br />As Matt Costello notes in his afterward, Hautala brings \\"... a special freedom to his short fiction ... as though the short stories didn't have to fit in a certain niche of Rick Hautala books, and he could just wail.\\" This assertion is proved repeatedly as Hautala takes readers on an oft-times bizarre tour of the human psyche.  In \\"Crying Wolf,\\" a tale dedicated to Richard Laymon, they're introduced to Billy Lewis, a sociopath<br />who'd give Todd Hunter of \\"Apt Pupil\\" fame a run for his money.  In \\"Sources of the Nile,\\" they meet a narrator who takes his eye fetish to extremes.  Finally, there's \\"Rubies and Pearls,\\" featuring a serial killer whose M.O. is sure to raise a few hackles.<br />Such is Hautala's craftsmanship that many readers won't even notice it.  Take the opening paragraph of  \\"Speedbump\\":<br />\\"I can't go swimmin' anymore, 'n all because Phil had to go and kill our son-of-a-b**** of a boss, Lester Croix.  I suppose it was bound to happen, but I dunno.  I think Phil coulda done a better job of it.  Lucky thing for Phil, though, I work with him and was the first one to notice Lester's body -- his hand, anyway.  That way, just as a favor to Phil, I could clean things up to make sure no one else ever found out about what he had done.\\"<br />Hardly anyone reading lines like these is apt to stop.  Openings like this are only one indication of Hautala's abundant literary gifts, all of which are on display in this estimable collection.I work with him and was the first one to notice Lester's body -- his hand, anyway.

US	52836712	R15E8IDA1NFMXR	0892967293	578975146	A Fine Dark Line	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A worthy successor to Lansdale's Edgar winner "The Bottoms"	Opening with a sweetly melancholic passage recounting some of his earliest memories, Stanley Mitchell, the now fifty seven year old narrator of A Fine Dark Line, quickly gets down to the business at hand, telling a story which began in the summer of 1958.  That summer, Stanley's discovery of a long buried diary eventually leads to the revelation of the truth behind a scandal in the town's past, involving the deaths of two young women from opposite ends of the social spectrum.  A modern day Tom Sawyer, Stanley finds himself in the middle of things, his curiosity and naivet&eacute; placing him in the path of mortal danger.<br />Given Lansdale's notorious sense of the bizarre, much of the novel concerns itself with Stanley`s often harrowing adventures around his hometown of Dewmont, Texas.  The strongest portions of the novel, however, deal not with Stanley's investigations, nor with their macabre side effects, but with his mundane, day to day life:  his loving, if sometimes embattled relationships with his father, mother, and sister, his comradery with his friend Richard (Huck to Stanley's Tom), his affectionate reliance on the family housekeeper Rosy Mae, and his often contentious association with Buster Lighthorse Smith, an elderly black man who runs the projector at the Mitchell family drive-in.  Lansdale's portrait of Stanley's family life and 1958 Dewmont possesses all the detail and authenticity of an old home movie; he chronicles the townspeople's prejudices, dreams, and petty squabbles with deceptive ease.  Doing so, he demonstrates that the \\"fine dark line\\" of the title delineates not only the barriers between races and social classes, and between the past and the present, but also the ones that exist between childhood and adulthood, and between spouses and friends.<br />Wise and knowing, A Fine Dark Line is blessed with the same air of authenticity as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, or Stephen King's \\"The Body,\\" making it a worthy successor to Lansdale's Edgar Award winning regional gothic The Bottoms.  Lansdale's writing continues to climb to higher levels--always a distinctive voice, he continues to hone his craft, producing ever more suspenseful, colorful, and engaging work, creating books which are increasingly more personal and heartfelt.dgar Award winning regional gothic The Bottoms.

US	52836712	REND1YL3DD15Q	0786015039	680292351	The Red Church	Books	3	0	2	N	N	A flawed first novel.	Built during the Civil War under the guidance of Reverend Wendell McFall, Potter's Mill Baptist Church provided a venue for the Reverend to preach his blasphemous sermons declaring the existence of God's \\"Second Son,\\" whose mission on earth is to undo the good done by Jesus.  In his madness, the preacher even went so far as to have the church painted red, in order to \\"bring the first son around to protect them from the second.\\" Although many thought him crazy, McCall attracted a loyal following, at least until the day a child was found dead on the altar of the church, sacrificed by the Reverend in an attempt to emulate the actions of the biblical Abraham.  Outraged, his parishioners used the church's bell rope to hang him from a dogwood tree.<br />Cut to present day, when the quiet of Potter's Mill is shattered by several particularly brutal murders.  Sheriff Frank Littlefield and his partner investigate, but find few solid leads.  Are the murders connected to the mysterious Archer McFall, who has returned to the town after a twenty-year absence to reopen the dilapidated Red Church?  Or were they committed by a demon linked to McFall's ancestor Wendell?  Littlefield, who finds both explanations plausible, is determined to discover the truth, even at the risk of his life.<br />Reading the praise heaped on Nicholson by such established writers like Sharyn McCrumb, Bentley Little, Kevin J. Anderson, and Stewart O'Nan, one might conclude that he's the second coming of Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft.  That's not the case.  The Red Church is a typical first novel, one whose positives barely outweigh its negatives.  Although Nicholson writes with undeniable energy and verve, and is capable of evoking genuine scares in his readers, his work is derivative, and filled with errors in continuity and logic, so many that one wonders if anyone at Pinnacle bothered to edit the book.  These errors sabotage the narrative, constantly jolting reader out of the reality into which Nicholson so strenuously labors to draw them.  Still, the book possesses a goofy breathlessness that keeps one turning pages despite its numerous flaws, marking Nicholson as someone who bears watching.Nicholson so strenuously labors to draw them.

The drapes hadn't been closed in daytime...since Father had to pay, \\" Bentley Little writes at the start of one his more startling stories. Clearly, here is an author who knows how to capture a reader's interest.<br />Little also knows how to invent and capitalize on surprising situations. In his new, wide ranging collection, entitled, with characteristic economy, The Collection, he writes about religious fervor (\\"Life with Father,\\" and \\"The Potato\\"), bizarre roadside attractions (\\"Skin\\"), malevolent dwarves (\\"The Mailman\\"), infidelity (\\"Monteith\\"), and the difficulties of accepting a step parent (\\"Coming Home Again\\"). Little brings offbeat imagination and an unerring sense for the macabre to each of these scenarios.<br />A prime example of these attributes is \\"The Sanctuary,\\" a story originally published in Cemetery Dance. Cal, introduced above, is the son of religious fanatics whose faith has morphed into madness. The tale opens as Cal cautiously enters his home, wary of his mother because he never knows when what he calls \\"The Rage\\" might overtake her. Within a page, we learn that Mom, who already has killed Cal's father, has claimed two more lives since that morning, first murdering a neighbor, then sacrificing Cal's sister to pay for her sin. Although Cal accepts what has happened, he dreads a repeat performance, considering his sister's ugly fate. Thus, when \\"The Rage\\" rises again, Cal turns the tables on his mother by murdering an innocent himself--now, Mom must die for HIS sins. The tale ends with Cal kneeling before the crucified corpses of his family, praying, \\"Our mother, who art in heaven...\\"<br />Cal finds himself trapped in a world he didn't make, helpless to forestall oncoming evil. Disturbingly, he gives himself over to that evil rather than combat it, as do many of Little's protagonists. Examples abound in The Collection. The title character of \\"Bob\\", mistaken for a hitman, eventually accedes to the wishes of the desperate 'clients' who seek him out. Brian, from \\"The Man in the Passenger Seat,\\" is so intimidated by a man who invades his car that he merely stands by as his unwelcome passenger kidnaps a young woman. The youths in \\"The Baby\\" commit murder in their quest to find a companion for a tiny corpse. Finally, there's Alan, the star of \\"Blood,\\" who, with little hesitation, supplies an evil entity with the seemingly endless supply of human blood it demands.<br />This sense of helplessness in the face of evil and the seemingly inevitable triumph of malevolence also permeates such tales as 'The Phonebook Man,\\" every paranoiac's worst nightmare, \\"Comes the Bad Time,\\" a classic tale of revenge from beyond the grave, \\"Paperwork, \\" a worthy addition to the \\"couple arriving in a strange town at exactly the wrong time\\" genre, \\"The Idol,\\" a bizarre reflection on celebrity and the power of totems/icons, the sad, sick, but strangely erotic \\"Pillow Talk,\\" and \\"The Show,\\" featuring a twist ending you'll not soon forget. It's also on prominent display in \\"Bumblebee\\" and \\"Maya's Mother \\" two pieces which feature a nameless private investigator whose numerous encounters with the supernatural have left him with a healthy respect for the power of the dark.<br />Little and/or his editor seems to have taken an \\"all-inclusive, warts and all\\" approach in compiling the stories eventually featured in The Collection, which might explain why the volume contains the inferior \\"Comes the Bad Time,\\" which Little himself denigrates in his introduction to the piece, and the nearly impenetrable \\"Against the Pale Sand\\" and \\"And I am Here, Fighting.\\" Fortunately, any negativity provoked by these tales is more than offset by the presence of two minor masterpieces, \\"The Washingtonians,\\" a compelling piece about political fanaticism which proves history is indeed written by the winners, and the absurd \\"Confessions of a Corporate Man,\\" best described as a combination of Grand Guignol and Dilbert.<br />Featuring stories from as far back as 1987, The Collection repeatedly proves that although he might not be the flashiest, most \\"literary\\" writer on the block, when it comes to compelling storytelling, Bentley Little has few peers.

Set in the sixteenth century, The Alchemist's Door chronicles the life of legendary English mathematician, alchemist and astrologer John Dee, the inspiration for Prospero in Shakespeare's Tempest and the title character in Marlowe's Dr. Faustus.  As the story opens, Dee and his strange associate, Edward Kelley, have accidentally summoned a demon that now dogs Dee's every step.  Hoping to evade the demon and improve his fortunes, Dee accepts potential patron Prince Laski's invitation to visit Poland.  But the demon follows him there, prompting Dee, his family and Kelley to flee to Prague.<br />In Prague, Dee senses that something terrible is about to happen.  By chance he discovers that the city straddles the border between earth and a demon dimension inhabited by, among other evil entities, the very creature that's been plaguing him.  Prague is also home to the mad Emperor Rudolph, a devotee and patron of the black arts, who seeks Dee's assistance in fashioning the legendary Philosopher's Stone.<br />On a visit to the Emperor Dee has a fateful encounter with fellow mystic Rabbi Judah Loew.  Dee and Loew join in a strained alliance, even as the Emperor initiates a pogrom against the Jews of Prague.  Loew seeks and receives Dee's assistance in creating a Golem-a man fashioned from clay-to defend the city's Jewish quarter from the Emperor's troops.<br />Dee also becomes involved in Loew's search for the fabled 36th righteous man.  Prophecy foretells that if the last righteous man dies, the world will end, and the dark spirits of the neighboring dimension will remake it in the own image.  The Emperor, believing he can influence the shape this new world will take, orders his troops to scour the city to find this man so that he may personally put him to death.  Dee, realizing that this is what his demonic tormentor has wanted all along, works with Loew to frustrate the Emperor's apocalyptic plans, even though it may cost him his life.<br />Some quick research on the Web indicates that Goldstein has done the same thing with John Dee's life that Tim Powers did with Kim Philby's in Declare, exploiting historical gaps and coincidences to tell a story that could have occurred, given certain supernatural assumptions. Thus, she posits a relationship between John Dee and Rabbi Loew that history does not record. Like Powers, she also manages to put human faces on legendary characters, carefully balancing glimpses into their personal lives with the more fantastic action.<br />The Alchemist's Door is lively and engaging, a skillful blend of history, legend, humor and high adventure, an exciting dark fantasy rich on character and colorful incident.

Seeking \\"spiritual entities\\" to act as their guides,  Wiccan Maria Sanchez and two disciples break into  Tolomato Cemetery in St. Augustine, Florida to perform a ritual designed to summon the spirits of the dead.  Expecting a benign reception, the trio is shocked to learn that they've summoned a demon, an ancient being intent on perpetuating its evil by impregnating human hosts.  Although the two disciples escape,  Maria is raped by the demon, who, discovering she is to weak to serve as a vessel for his offspring, kills her, leaving her tattered corpse among the tombstones.<br />Her remains are discovered by Jack Colvin, a Detective working on the St. Augustine police force.  Stunned by the violence done to Maria Sanchez, Colvin believes it to be an isolated incident.  Then, other bodies turn up, all torn to shreds.  His investigations lead him to the conclusion that he is dealing with something out of the ordinary.  He becomes even more convinced of this when he meets tour guide Ssabra Onih,  who tells him she has been drafted by the spirit of Indian Chief Tolomato to combat the demon.  At first dismissive, he begins to see that Onih does indeed have unique insight into recent events, later teaming with her in an effort to destroy the demon.<br />Horror aficionados will no doubt recognize the plot, as it has been used many times over the decades, most recently, for example, in Edo Van Belkom's Martyrs.  As with that novel, readers' enjoyment of Breed  will vary according to just how many ancient burial ground stories they've read over the years.  For those with little exposure to this type of material, Breed will provide a pleasant diversion.  For those with a bit more familiarity with this sub genre, Breed might seem a bit tired, a reworking of overused plot elements with a predictable (but still satisfying) ending.<br />A writer of considerable gifts, Goingback delivers a well-crafted, highly readable tale, featuring characters that most readers will come to care about.  He also displays a sly sense of humor, as demonstrated by the witty repartee between Ssabra and Chief Tolomato, who seems pretty hip for someone who's been dead for a couple of centuries.  If there's any knock on his writing, it's his habit of telling rather than showing.  Sometimes, this works to his advantage, as when he is describing St. Augustine, a town on which he's obviously done extensive research.  Most of the time, however, readers will get the odd sense that Goingback doesn't really believe they are capable of filling in any blanks (one glaring example is that he's still referring to his hero as \\"Detective Jim Colvin\\" late in the book, at a point where \\"Jim\\" or even \\"Colvin\\" would do).

This is especially evident in the title story (Partridge's take on the Frankenstein mythology), and in tales like \\"Undead Origami\\" (featuring Howard Hughes as a vampire), \\"Do Not Hasten to Bid Me Adieu\\" (a deconstruction of and epilogue to Stoker's Dracula),  \\"In Beauty, Like the Night (where he uses zombies to make a point about the porno industry), and \\"The Pack\\" (a clever mixture of werewolves, bikers, and Mayberry).<br />Another talent on display is Partridge's ability to grab his audience's attention from the first sentence. Witness this, from \\"Red Right Hand\\":<br />\\"Claire held the gun in her left hand, the blood in her right.\\"<br />This, from \\"Coyotes\\":<br />\\"I was out past the dump, digging a grave for the coyote, when I spotted the van with the naked Mexican chained to the bumper heading my way.\\"<br />Finally, this, from \\"Tombstone Moon\\":<br />\\"Black entered the cemetery shack and tossed the severed ear onto the desk, between a can of Brown Derby and a salami sandwich missing a bite.\\"<br />Not everything in the Partridge universe is this straightforward, however.  Tales like \\"Blood Money,\\" `Wrong Turn,\\" Minutes,\\" \\"Where the Woodbine Twineth,\\" and  \\"Mr. Fox\\" are less accessible, more exercises in style than in linear storytelling.  Their often surreal qualities require more work on the part of the reader, an investment of time and effort that is ultimately rewarding.<br />Despite the obvious craftsmanship behind his work, there is nothing self-conscious or mannered about Norman Partridge's writing.  There's an urgency about almost everything he writes, as if, to quote Peter Straub, Partridge is writing \\"as though his life depends on the words he sets down on the page.\\"  This urgency has served him well thus far (pick up previous collections, Mr. Fox and Other Feral Tales and Bad Intentions for further proof), and, by all indications, should exert a positive influence on his work for years to come.n style than in linear storytelling.

US	52836712	REW6GQ68YKM8B	0843949899	978197469	Slain in the Spirit	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A gripping, psychologically insightful tale.	Leila Blackwell suffers from keratitis, a condition that, coupled with prior eye problems, is slowly robbing her of her sight.  Nevertheless, she stubbornly tries to maintain a \\"normal\\" lifestyle, often forsaking the companionship of her lover Cathy to act independently, as any fully sighted person might do.  It's thus that she finds herself alone in a public rest room when a familiar male voice penetrates the silence, saying, \\"Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.\\"<br />The voice belongs to the born again Russell Gavon, a former high school class mate, who believes God wants him to save Leila from her sinful existence.  With this objective, he kidnaps Leila and confines her in an abandoned building.  The two engage in a protracted battle of wills, Russell believing Leila's soul is at risk, Leila soon realizing that her very life is what's really at stake.  Hampered by worsening eyesight (Russell withholds her medication, believing the Lord will heal her after she comes to her senses) and self-imposed mental obstacles, Leila vacillates between defiance and despair between increasingly desperate escape attempts.<br />It is somewhat disingenuous to call Slain in the Spirit a horror novel; it is more accurately classified as a suspense novel, psychological thriller or tragedy.  While certain aspects of the story can be deemed horrific, the book contains nary a whiff of the supernatural - whatever shivers the novel evokes lie in the characters' reactions to events, and in the way they treat each other and themselves.  Still, this is enough, at least for someone with Tem's storytelling talents.<br />Tem continues her tradition of writing about damaged souls, characters whose personal demons are far more dangerous to their well being than are outside forces.  Leila is a curious, almost annoying choice for a heroine.  Far from the durable, quick witted protagonist one might expect to encounter in a piece like this (think Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark), Leila is exceedingly passive, almost complacent, at several points in the story even feeling empathy for her deranged captor's skewed point of view.  Russell also defies expectations - although he's the villain of the piece, readers begin to feel sorry for this unfortunate man, whose mental illness makes him so dangerous.  The interaction between the two, however, makes for edge of the seat reading.<br />Slain in the Spirit recalls (oddly enough, given the difference in their styles) some of Stephen King's work, particularly books like Gerald's Game and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, books which King took on in part because the narrowness of their scope, setting, and cast presented creative challenges.  Like King, Tem meets that challenge, crafting a gripping, engaging story from the limited resources she allowed herself to work with.  For instance, she does a masterful job of telling the story from Leila's point of view, forcing her to describe the world as her nearly blind heroine \\"sees\\" it, a colorless, claustrophobic, perilous world that Leila experiences primarily through her senses of hearing, smell, and touch.<br />Although some readers might be turned off by Leila's lack of personal growth over the course of her ordeal, or by the novel's ambiguous ending, most will realize that Tem has succeeded in wringing every ounce of entertainment value from her sad, but psychologically insightful, tale.ceedingly passive, almost complacent, at several points in the story even feeling empathy for her deranged captor's skewed point of view.

US	52836712	R1YRP3RBK4GAMH	0843949988	151877050	Wounds	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Jefferson avoids the sophomore slump	If Voice of the Blood was Jemiah Jefferson's Interview with the Vampire, then Wounds is most assuredly her Queen of the Dead.  But where Voice of the Blood showed weaknesses typical of any first novel, Wounds showcases a writer who has matured, a writer confident in her talent and skills, unafraid to offend or shock.<br />Wounds picks up a few months after the conclusion of Voice, focusing on Daniel Blum, a supporting character from that novel.  Nearly a century old, the vampire has never matured mentally or physically beyond his early twenties.  Jaded, bored and depressed, Daniel spends most of his time seeking new distractions, a pastime which is becoming more futile by the day.<br />Such is his state of mind then when he encounters Sybil, an erotic dancer unique in that the vampire can neither penetrate her thoughts nor influence her actions.  Entranced, Daniel begins a relentless and eventually successful romantic pursuit of the woman, who, although human, is far more vicious and perverse than he, exhorting Daniel to levels of violence excessive even by his standards.  Such is Daniel's infatuation, however, that he consistently does her bidding, even when it endangers his life.<br />It was something of a surprise to pick up Wounds and discover that Jefferson had chosen to focus on Daniel, rather than Ariane, the heroine of Voice of the Blood.  Arguably, Ariane's complex personality and personal conflicts would have provided more fictional fodder for the sequel.  For instance, Jefferson could have leveraged Ariane's strained relationship with her vampire husband or her efforts to understand vampirism through scientific research to fashion her follow-up.  But Jefferson forsakes the easy path--Ariane remains in the background here, together with Ricari, the vampire who also played a prominent role in Voice of the Blood.  Their individual cameos, however, are quite effective.<br />Jefferson's focus on the relationship of these mismatched misfits allows her to explore some interesting terrain, such as the very human craving to be loved, and the ways in which love can be perverted.  Daniel, an immortal monster, has become so desperate for intimacy that he literally bears his throat to the depraved megalomaniac Sybil.  Jefferson so effectively chronicles Daniel's surrender of self that readers may grow angry with the character, wondering what could possibly make him so desperate.  But it's this desperation that powers the novel, compelling readers to turn the next page and see just how bad it's going to get.  This desperation is likely to polarize readers, dividing them into two groups, those that find the relationship ridiculous, and those that can't help watching in sick fascination as the book lumbers towards its stunning, but in hindsight inevitable, climax.<br />Shocking, intense, and sexually charged, Jefferson's sophomore effort is as commendable as it is twisted, a worthy effort that should win her an even larger readership.  Although it could have been pared down a little, it's a first rate piece of writing, one which most devotees of vampire fiction should enjoy.to explore some interesting terrain, such as the very human craving to be loved, and the ways in which love can be perverted.

As Michael Arnzen accurately notes in his enthusiastic introduction, most of the stories in Dark Demons seem to be inspired by loss, whether it be the loss of a loved one, a loss of identity, or perhaps most disturbingly, a loss of humanity.  Thus, it's appropriate that a story like  \\"Something Profound\\" opens this collection.  The tale of a son coming to terms with his father's painful and difficult legacy, it deals with the myriad emotions engendered by the death of a parent, and how parents influence the lives of their children in countless (and, in this case chilling) ways.<br />\\"Something Profound' is only one example of Newton's seeming preoccupation with loss.  \\"Angels of Mercy, Angels of Grief\\" tells the tale of a husband who gets an unwelcome glimpse into the workings of existence after his wife is killed in a car accident.  \\"Work of Art\\" addresses the sacrifices artists make for their craft. \\"The Pit\\" deals with surrendering to the whims of the masses, and \\"The Banana Man\\" focuses on loss of sanity.<br />Along with the sense of loss, each story includes an odd sense of inevitability, a pervasive feeling that things will end badly.  This is particularly evident in tales like \\"Waves,\\" \\"The Mothering Hole,\\" \\"Puppies for Sale,\\" and \\"In the Name of Love,\\" stories that would likely provide Newton's psychologist adequate fodder for multiple sessions, the (Clive) Barkeresque \\"Better Red and Diamond Eyes,\\" and  \\"The Mole Trap\\" which will probably remind most readers of Stephen King's classic, \\"The Ledge.\\"<br />A handful of misfires blemish this otherwise worthy collection, most notably the simple minded  \\"Do They Bury Their Dead,\\" the brief, dismissible \\"The Face,\\" and the familiar and predictable \\"Secrets...Like Bones in Slippery Dirt,\\" `The Afghan,\\" and \\"The Bleeding of Mary Cross. \\" Although their presence diminishes the collection's overall impact, their negative effect is minimal, as Newton is worth reading even when he's not at the top of his form.  He shows a fine eye for detail, populating his stories with edgy characters forced to handle the dark curves life hurls at them.  Dark Demons artfully takes readers on a long, strange trip into the corners of a demented universe-arrange a visit soon as possible.ws a fine eye for detail, populating his stories with edgy characters forced to handle the dark curves life hurls at them.

It's even more widely known \\"fact\\" that readers won't buy an anthology that doesn't feature a name (think King, Koontz or Rice) author.  No doubt this \\"logic\\" has kept many a decent anthology from even getting out of the planning stages.<br />It's fortunate then that The Darker Side avoided this sad fate.  John Pelan has assembled a diverse, winning collection of stories from veterans and newcomers alike, an anthology that should appeal to a broad audience.  And the book doesn't suffer at all from the lack of 600 pound gorillas among the ranks of it contributors.<br />Although there are several outright misfires (entries from Tom Piccirrilli, Charlie Jacob, Wilum Pugmire/Chad Hensley and Shikhar Dixit were will leave you scratching your head) and a couple of near misses (old dependables Richard Laymon and David B. Silva seem to be merely going through the motions), there's plenty here to merit your attention.  The anthology is book ended by two excellent stories, opening strongly with Edo Van Belkom's \\"Do You See What I Fear?\\" a tale in the tradition of The Twilight Zone, and closing with Tim Lebbon's \\"Hell Came Down,\\" the story of a mage on the trail of an apprentice whose magic threaten to bring about apocalypse.  Other standouts include Brian Hodge's \\"Pull,\\" a story that says you don't need to go home again, because home is always a part of you, James Dorr's \\"Pets,\\" guaranteed to make you call an exterminator immediately after you finish, Mehitobel Wilson's tragicomedy of manners \\"The Mannerly Man,\\" Lucy Taylor's \\"Unspeakable,\\" about the long term effects of sexual abuse, and Pelan's own \\"Armies of the Night,\\" a tale of obsession which recalls aspects of Stephen King's short story, \\"Battleground\\".<br />As good as, if not better than its predecessor, the well received Darkside, The Darker Side will likely generate its share of nominees for both the Stokers and International Horror Guild awards for short fiction, if not its own nomination for best anthology.  Not every story will appeal to every reader, owing to the wide range of styles and subject matter, but most readers will find something to suit their tastes.rt fiction, if not its own nomination for best anthology.

As Atherton College freshmen, Kathryn Parker, Randall Stone and Jesse Lowry are having markedly different collegiate experiences.  Kathryn, coming off a traumatic high school relationship, is content to pursue an intense friendship with the openly gay Randall.  Randall, in turn, has embarked on a secretive affair with his middle aged art history professor, Dr. Eric Eberman.  The narcissistic Jesse has already had flings with a number of partners of both sexes.<br />As if finding their place in the world was not enough, things become further complicated when Dr. Eberman's wife Lisa is killed in a car crash, apparently driving under the influence of alcohol.  Randall, having passed out after nipping some booze from the Eberman's liquor cabinet, suspects that the professor may have in fact drugged his alcoholic wife, thus insuring that she was incapable of driving.  The truth, which is tied to a death that occurred some two decades prior, is far more horrible.<br />Like the characters in Rice's surprisingly accomplished debut novel, 2000's A Density of Souls, each protagonist has terrible secrets and surplus emotional baggage.  Like those characters, they also drone on endlessly about their thoughts and feelings, unaware of how tedious they might sound to somebody on the outside.  Their self-absorption can become annoying, until one remembers what was like to actually be that age.  Still, Rice manages to create empathy for these damaged youths, despite their shortcomings.<br />Despite Rice's lineage (he's the son of Anne and Stan Rice), the action is grounded in the \\"real\\" world, albeit a melodramatic world rife with pain and madness, a world peopled with all too human monsters.  In this setting, he makes some telling points about the masks everyone wears, about humanity's endless capacity for self-deception, and about the power of ideas, especially as they effect the naïve and inexperienced among us.  One does sense, however, that Rice has said all he has to say on these particular subjects, that he'd do well to explore new territory in his next novel. After all, a third consecutive \\"college gothic\\" might be pushing it.on these particular subjects, that he'd do well to explore new territory in his next novel.

Returning to her desk in the Donnerville town library just before closing time, librarian Jane finds an envelope on her chair.  Inside she finds a fifty dollar bill and a message:  \\"Dear Jane, Come and play with me.  For further instructions, look homeward, angel.  You'll be glad you did. Warmest Regards, MOG (Master of Games).\\"<br />Guessing that the mysterious Mog is referring to the classic book by Thomas Wolfe,Jane locates it on the shelves.  In its pages she finds a hundred dollar bill and further instructions.  Thus begins a high stakes game of cat and mouse between her and Mog, a game where risks and rewards escalate at each stage. Appealing to Jane's greed and competitive spirit, Mog gradually ups the ante to the point where Jane is battling for her very life, a battle where the odds are most definitely against her.<br />I'm pleased Leisure saw fit to reprint In the Dark, one of my favorite Laymon novels.  Displaying all his strengths--expert pacing, a great sense of atmosphere and a winning sense of humor--it also features two of the most fully developed characters he's created, the aforementioned Jane, and her<br />companion Brace, a man she meets at the beginning of the game.  The novel focuses on Jane's transformation from a dowdy wallflower to an assertive, aggressive and attractive young woman, equal to any opponent, even an apparent psychopath.  Laymon captures her inner turmoil quite well, making her reactions to Mog's increasingly outrageous,dangerous<br />tasks are that much more believable.  He's also careful in his approach to chronicling the budding romantic relationship between Jane and Brace, taking great pains to show an initial chemical attraction blossom into a deeper love based on shared experience and mutual respect.  It's nice to watch Laymon tackle an<br />adult relationship for a change, instead of providing yet another (albeit accurate)glimpse into the skewed psyches of the horny teenagers who populate so many of his stories.<br />What's most interesting about the novel is the nature of \\"the game\\" itself. Mog's tactic of offering money to Jane to provoke uncharacteristic behaviors, and in placing her in increasingly untenable situations, prefigured reality shows like Survivor, Temptation Island and Big Brother by several years. The sad thing  about reading quality work like In the Dark is recalling Laymon's sudden death last year, and the fact that there are no new Laymon books to look forward to.st interesting about the novel is the nature of \\"the game\\" itself.

Driving home through a fierce blizzard, Dan and Megan, accompanied by their teenage daughter Nikki, spot a man standing in the middle of a dark country road, seemingly having materialized out of nowhere.  Offering him a ride, the family quickly comes to regret their act of generosity -- Brand, as the man calls himself, unnerves them all with his strange demeanor and stranger mutterings.  When the high strung Megan can't stand it any longer, they literally eject him from their car.  Shaken, they resume their trip, leaving Brand to fend for himself on the nearly deserted stretch of road.<br />In the days that follow, Brand infiltrates their minds and<br />lives, seeming to shadow their every move.  Megan becomes convinced that Brand is spying on her through the eyes of insects and animals, Dan has an altercation with him in a local tavern, and Nikki spots him haunting a music studio where she and her band are making a recording.  At first a minor irritation, Brand slowly ups the ante, sadistically torturing the unfortunate trio.<br />A supernatural take on John D. MacDonald's The Executioners, the well-executed Face chronicles the disintegration of a family under attack from within and without.  Dan, Megan and Nikki have lots of emotional baggage, most of it originating in a rape Megan suffered six years before.  Megan is paranoid, and has retreated into religion, Dan has been unmanned by his perceived inability to protect his wife.  Estranged from each other, they are also losing touch with their daughter, who is dealing with her emerging sexuality.  Seemingly peering into their souls, Brand exploits these weaknesses to wreak his revenge.<br />At first, it's hard to tell whether Brand actually exists,or is<br />something that the family has conjured out of its misery.  In fact, until he acts against their friends and acquaintances, one might easily assume that he exists only in their imaginations.  Regardless of his origins or corporeality, it's disquieting to watch his escalating attacks.  It's also disquieting that Lebbon offers no easy explanations or outs.  Asked &quot;Why?&quot; by Dan, Brand replies, &quot;Sometimes bad things happen to good people.&quot;  Even as Brand is seemingly dispatched, one senses he's merely stepped offstage, waiting for another opportunity to wreak havoc.<br />Intense and affecting, Face will seize and hold your attention from the opening paragraph to the end.

There's a reason William F. Nolan's short stories are included in so many &quot;Best of&quot; horror anthologies published over the past five decades:  Nolan has written some of the most vivid and memorable horror of the last half century, stories respected by fan and pro alike.  Ample proof of this can be found in Dark Universe, a collection of forty-one of Nolan's personal favorites selected from among his own work--notably, some of the stronger stories are those he's written in the last decade, showing that, like fine wine, this writer has improved with age.  The book's a virtual primer on good storytelling--Nolan's consistent style is noteworthy for its clear, uncluttered prose, and each story demonstrates his instinctive knowledge of what scares us.  This fine work, coupled with Nolan's illuminating personal notes<br />on each story and Christopher Conlon's admiring but clear eyed introduction, make this a volume that belongs on any horror aficionado's shelf.	2002-01-17

In From The Dust Returned, a book literally fifty years in the making, Ray Bradbury revisits an old haunt, The Autumn House, a Mecca of sorts for all manner of ghosts, ghouls, vampires, werewolves, witches, and things that go bump in the night.  The house, rendered in loving detail by the great Charles Addams on the wrap around dust jacket, is also home to some of Bradbury's most memorable creations: the housebound Cecy, whose spirit roams the earth each night, seeking sensation by briefly inhabiting others' bodies, the foundling Timothy, the only &quot;normal&quot; denizen of the house, and good ol' Uncle Einar, he of the magnificent pair of wings.<br />A reworking of several of his short stories (among them the renowned &quot;Homecoming&quot;), the book is a must have for Bradbury fans.  Is it prime Bradbury?  Mostly.  Is it self indulgent?  Yes, a bit.  But hell, the man's a legitimate national treasure (just last year, he received the National Book Award's Medal of Distinguished Honor) , and I'm happy he's reached that point in his career and life where he can pursue so obvious a labor of love as this.  His joy in his work is evident, as his love for these characters,  drawn from memories of his own relatives and acquaintances.  A good book to share with children, particularly around Halloween, it's a pleasant way to while away a couple of hours, especially for those already familiar with Bradbury's one of a kind prose style.	2002-01-11

While he heals, Todd rents the former residence of 1920s screen siren Katya Lupi, located in a little frequented part of Hollywood called Coldheart Canyon.<br /><br />An astonished Todd discovers the youthful Lupi still living there. Seducing Todd, with whom she wants to spend eternity, Lupi reveals the secret of her youth and the myriad phantasms haunting the grounds.  Deep in the bowels of her home lies \\"The Devil's Country,\\" a room-size mosaic depicting a 17th century hunting scene, a strange tableau worthy of Bosch.  A portal to another reality, the mosaic bestows youth upon its visitors.  At<br />first permitting most of Hollywood access, Lupi came to fear that these numerous visits might drain the mosaic's power.  She thus denied her former friends access to the room, causing them to wither and die.  But even death provides no relief, as they are drawn to the mosaic from beyond the grave.<br /><br />Todd nearly succumbs to Lupi's charms and the lure of the mosaic, but is rescued by obsessive fan Tammy Lauper, who has tracked him to Coldheart Canyon.  Todd is not yet safe, however, as he is destined to visit Coldheart Canyon a final time to settle his fate.<br /><br />A secret history of Hollywood, Coldheart Canyon reflects that city's reputation for making and breaking dreams, for blurring the line between reality and fantasy.  Transformed into unapologetic voyeurs, readers are drawn into Barker's narrative by his edgy, enthralling, brutal and erotic storytelling, and by his lush, assured prose. With nary a misstep, Barker deftly exploits Hollywood stereotypes and clich&eacute;s.  Thus, readers encounter a number of stock characters, including a washed up actor, a ruthless agent, a perky heroine, a reclusive actress (replete with devoted manservant, of course), and a blowhard producer we just KNOW will die a violent death. Barker also explores such timeless themes as excessive ambition, fleeting loyalties, easy sex, movieland's obsession with youth, and the symbiotic relationship between obsessive fans and artists. Throughout, he remains true to his very vulnerable, very human central cast, providing telling insights into their characters that handily win readers over.  One example is the portion of the book where Todd deals with the illness and death of his dog Dempsey, drawn from Barker's own experience.  Another is the hollowness of Tammy Lauper's life before she actually meets Todd -- a good person, her potent energies are wasted on her all consuming passion for a total stranger.<br /><br />Once again, Barker explores the border between dream and nightmare, expertly shifting from love to brutality, from the banal to the fantastic.

US	52836712	R6SXBXWGRMBFF	0380976528	535649961	Declare: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Lovecraft meets Tradecraft	A product of copious research and a prodigious imagination, Declare marries espionage with the mystical (&quot;Lovecraft meets tradecraft,&quot; as the author himself put it in an interview ). Working within a framework of the published details of the lives of T. E. Lawrence, Guy Burgess, St. John Philby and his infamous son, Kim, Powers delivers a fine dark fantasy that proudly displays myriad influences, among them The 1001 Arabian Nights, the Old Testament, Rudyard Kipling's Kim, and the novels of Graham Greene and John LeCarre. Powers even manages to evoke Dickens and the British boarding school sub- genre, most recently used to good effect in quite another context in J. K. Rowley's outrageously popular Harry Potter series.<br />Declare chronicles the life and times of Andrew Hale, an important, but anonymous, player in the modern version of the 19th Century's &quot;Great Game&quot; between Britian and Russia. From the moment he is first recruited by British intelligence, fate leads Hale toward a clash with the legendary double agent, Kim Philby. Working as a low level researcher, Hale learns of the Russian fascination with Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey. Intelligence indicates that in 1883, the Russians actually transported a powerful supernatural entity known as a djinn from Ararat to their homeland, where, in return for human sacrifice, the being has protected its borders ever since. The reports also indicate the that djinn is only one of many other wordly beings residing on the mount, and that the Russians are interested in furthering their contacts with what may be a community of fallen angels.<br />As he rises through the ranks, he also becomes acquainted with the enigmatic Philby, a stuttering, pretentious creep whose destiny, it is slowly revealed, is also tied to the supernatural inhabitants of Mt. Ararat. Powers goes on to chronicle Hale's growing awareness of the magnitude of the issues he's confronting, alternating between the events of Hale's 1948 and 1963 treks to Ararat to counter Soviet moves, expeditions which both end tragically, costing dozens of lives on both sides. Doing so, he simultaneously illuminates Hale's mysterious background, and such earthshaking events as the erection and subsequent destruction of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br />While it is perhaps too early to dub this epic Powers' magnum opus, the case can certainly be made that it is the highpoint of his career thus far, as the novel displays all the positive qualities that have drawn readers to his writing over the years. Certainly, the idea of marrying two seemingly disparate worlds is not a new one for Powers--for instance, he explored similar territory in Last Call, which posited Bugsy Seigel as the modern incarnation of the legendary Fisher King. But Declare finds Powers in rare form, effectively exploring the nature of reality.nd 1963 treks to Ararat to counter Soviet moves, expeditions which both end tragically, costing dozens of lives on both sides.

In 1981, twelve year old Jack Sawyer had a series of fantastic adventures in a parallel reality known as the Territories, adventures chronicled in King and Straub's 1984 collaborative effort, The Talisman.  Jack, however, has thoroughly repressed all memories of those events.  Since that time, Jack has<br />become, to use his own word, a &quot;coppiceman,&quot; an LAPD detective whose exploits have garnered considerable attention in the national press.  Apparently, his success is largely related to his time spent in the Territories and his experiences with the Talisman.<br />One of Jack's greatest professional triumphs occurred in the small town of French Landing, Wisconsin, where he apprehended a killer who had taken a life while visiting Los Angeles.  Jack's visit to the Landing left a deep impression on him, so profound that he retired there shortly after closing the case.  Jack had looked forward to a peaceful retirement, but that was not to be. French Landing is being terrorized by the Fisherman, a serial killer who dismembers and cannibalizes young children.  Baffled by the complete absence of leads, the local sheriff asks Jack for assistance.<br />Although initially reluctant to become involved, Jack decides to help, in part due to the prodding of his friend, blind DJ Henry Leydon who assumes the role as Jack's guide and mentor in the physical absence of The Talisman's Speedy Parker. Immersing himself in the case, Jack realizes that the killings are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the evil present in French Landing.  He once again finds himself in the Territories, where the Fisherman, a servant of the evil entity known as the Crimson King, disappears with his victims. Jack's quest leads him to the mysterious Black House, a portal to the Territories, and a final, deadly confrontation with the Fisherman.<br />Structurally, Black House is reminiscent  of Insomnia, mainly due to its slow transition from stark reality to the realm of the fantastic, and in the fact that its characters, facing off against King's recurring major villain the Crimson King, are merely pawns in a much larger cosmic chess game.  It differs from The Talisman in that the writing is more seamless--the authors went to great lengths to conceal their specific contributions to the text, and it shows.  The book also has the obvious advantage<br />of being written by two more mature, more seasoned authors--King and Straub are seventeen years older and seventeen years wiser regarding their craft.  Despite their widely acknowledged skill and considerable success, they continue to grow and evolve as writers.  A good example of this is their use of the third person plural narration.  Somewhat distracting at first, it turns out to be a wise choice, even providing the authors with a chance to engage in some self-deprecating humor.<br />Although serial killers in Wisconsin are squarely in Straub &quot;territory,&quot; it's clear that the book is set in the Stephen King universe.  Besides the Crimson King, there are mentions of breakers and of Ted Brautigan, a concept and character from Hearts in Atlantis.  Interestingly, a link is forged between<br />King's and Straub's realities when a relative of one of the characters from Ghost Story is mentioned in passing.<br />Black House settles some questions about continuity in the Stephen King universe, but raises others.  As the book's finale clearly leaves room for a sequel, more answers (and more questions) are probably forthcoming.  If that sequel's half as good as Black House, readers have a considerable treat in store.in the fact that its characters, facing off against King's recurring major villain the Crimson King, are merely pawns in a much larger cosmic chess game.

US	52836712	REE4E9DS8QOXW	158881002X	309721087	The Light at the End	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Kudos to Stealth Press for bringing this one back!	You know you're getting older when all your favorite songs are labeled oldies, the sports figures you admired are playing in &quot;Old Timers Day&quot; games, and some of the books you've read are now considered &quot;classics.&quot; It's distressing to realize you're not immune to the passage of time, and also that your prior perceptions about what was worthwhile might have been misguided, if not outright wrong. The flip side of this particular coin is rereading the favorites of your youth and finding that they still stand up. In recent years I've had that experience with many of Stephen King's earlier works. This past spring, I experienced it with the new Stealth Press hardcover reprint of Craig Skipp and John Spector's The Light At The End.<br />For those of you who aren't familiar with this work, a brief summary is in order. The book focuses on two characters, punk/goth vampire Rudy Pasko, and the man who has vowed to kill him, the aptly named Joseph Hunter. Rudy, a jerk and a loser in life, gains his vampiric powers by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, stumbling upon a grisly subway massacre perpetrated by an evil ancient entity. Sired merely to amuse that entity, Rudy starts to groove on his new powers, using them to push back against a world he's always hated. The massacre, coupled with Rudy's high profile activities, brings him to the attention of Hunter, a hulking, gruff, compulsive do-gooder looking for something to hit after the death of his beloved mother. Their anger brings them into conflict, and also drives the horrific events to come. And they are horrific, even if they seem a little tamer to me due to the passage of time and to changes in my perception of what should be labeled &quot;extreme.&quot;<br />In 1986 The Light at the End stood at the center of the then-raging debate of splatterpunk v. quiet horror (thank goodness we all realized the genre was big enough to include works from all points in the spectrum -- now if we could only stop talking about whether horror is dead, thriving, comatose or irrelevant). Skipp and Spector, striding through the horror community like the rock stars they emulated, championed a more visceral, high energy, in-your-face kind of horror than that to which we were accustomed, pushing out at the boundaries. They had their progenitors of course: folks like Robert Bloch, Stephen King, Richard Laymon, Jack Ketchum and the young upstart Clive Barker (whose &quot;The Midnight Meat Train&quot; seems to have inspired Light's grisly opening sequence). This book, considered with works such as S. P. Somtow's Vampire Junction, seems in hindsight to have been almost a seminal influence on later writers. One could make the case that the stylish Light made splatterpunk more acceptable, paving the way for writers as diverse as David Schow, Nancy Collins, Poppy Z. Brite, Christopher Golden, Ray Garton, Rex Miller and Edward Lee, giving them permission to go over the top in their own writing (although, in Garton's case, it may just have validated over the top work he'd already published, like Seductions). It was a no holds barred style of storytelling that has trickled down to movies and television, as evidenced by the work of folks like Joss &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; Whedon, whose character Spike bears more than a passing resemblance to Rudy.<br />This was and remains a swift paced, high-impact book, long on action, but also on character development -- Rudy's anger is tangible, as is Hunter's grief. The supporting cast is well developed, and the New York City backdrop is effective -- Skipp and Spector's New York vividly captured much of America's perception of the city as a cesspool. Yes, they do show signs of their relative inexperience at the time (for instance, a number of chapters end with annoying tag lines like, &quot;That was the last time they would see him alive&quot;), but these are easily overlooked when compared to the overall quality of the narrative. This bookcan be enjoyed by &quot;old farts&quot; and &quot;whippersnappers&quot; alike, either reliving fond memories or creating new ones. Kudos to Stealth Press for bringing it back in this handsome hardcover.ook can be enjoyed by &quot;old farts&quot; and &quot;whippersnappers&quot; alike, either reliving fond memories or creating new ones.

US	52836712	RC2N2SM6CJ3UV	0843948302	995246562	Voice of the Blood	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Solid writing, but more of the same old thing.	I don't really have much to say about this one, the story of a young woman initiated into what the back cover somewhat melodramatically refers to as &quot;the world of the undead, the vampire, a world far beyond the myths and legends that the living think they know. A world even more horrifying than the living could suspect.&quot; Apart from minor missteps, the writing is solid, but the story doesn't break new ground, featuring as it does a vampire initiate, an older, self-pitying vampire who cherishes the past, and his long time companion, a younger, more aggressive creature of the night who revels in everything the modern world has to offer. We've seen this kind of thing before, from Dark Shadows' Barnabas Collins, to Anne Rice's increasingly banal vampire books, to Nancy Collins' Sonja Blue series. Jefferson does a credible job, but Voice is little more than a rehash of plot elements from other sources. The book's final chapters are somewhat more intriguing than those which preceded them, as Jefferson demonstrates a little individuality, describing in vivid detail the main character's metamorphosis from human to vampire, a desperate journey to save her sire's life, and two uneasy reconciliations between former lovers. Still, it isn't enough to overcome the comparative tediousness of the first two hundred sixteen pages. In the end, it's merely competent, a good, quick read, a decent travel companion, but no more than that. Readers who like this kind of thing might better spend their time with books like Rice's The Vampire Lestat, S. P. Somtow's Vampire Junction, Suzy Mckee Charnas' The Vampire Tapestry, or Michael Talbot's The Delicate Dependency.	2001-08-24

While trying to negotiate a treacherous stretch of mountain trail, Phil loses his balance and falls into a ravine hundreds of feet below.  Attempting to locate his friend, Mark peers over a ledge and sees something that will change his life forever--Phil, being carried away by a hulking, ape-like creature.<br />Although disoriented, Mark makes his way back to civilization.  Unable to convince the authorities to mount a credible search for Phil, and wracked by the guilt of leaving his friend behind, Mark decides he must return to Mount Agiochook and conduct his own search.  It is a fateful decision, which leads to a protracted and bloody confrontation with the strange inhabitants of the Mount.  Before book's end, Mark loses almost everything he holds dear.<br />For most of the novel, Hautala tells a straightforward adventure story of man versus monster, with a little chill thrown in here and there.  Then,  just when you think you've got it all figured out, he throws you a massive, terrifying curveball, penning a scene so horrifying that it still disturbs me to think about it years later.  I've been  told that this particular scene is what kept the more &quot;mainstream&quot; publishers from buying this book-- until now, that is.	2001-08-22

A simple man, Avery is content to run his general store, fish, and pass the empty hours with his only companion, his dog Red.  His life is upset, however, by the actions of an unfeeling teenager, who coldly shoots the dog during a robbery attempt.  Stunned,  Avery is left standing over the corpse of his friend, watching the boy and his cohorts as they saunter away, laughing.<br />Avery mourns, then gets angry.  He pursues the young killer and his companions, only to find that the boys' parents and society in general care little for his loss.  Increasingly frustrated, Avery decides to take matters into his own hands, leading to a tragic and bloody confrontation at book's end.<br />Once again, Ketchum tells a gripping tale the way only he can.  I did notice, however, that Red had a more personal feel to it than previous efforts.  Ketchum's style seems more expansive than in the past in the first two sections of the book, perhaps reflecting a greater emphasis on character development--Avery is probably the most carefully rendered character I've encountered in Ketchum's fiction.  Ketchum then quickens the pace and returns to his more typical, lean prose in the final third of the book, as the tension mounts and the action becomes more explosive.<br />A true American original, Ketchum deserves your attention.	2001-08-22

This updated version of the 1988 Bram Stoker Award winner is appealing for several reasons.  First, it's a modern classic in horror scholarship, a survey of horror literature spanning fifteen centuries, several genres, and a plethora of authors.  Second, there's the thrill of reading great writers' thoughts about their favorite authors--Stephen King on Robert Marasco, Peter Straub on King, and Ed Bryant on Dan Simmons among others.  Third, it's basically a big list of good books.  The 100 entries combined with an extensive list of recommended titles (now updated through 1997) have enriched my reading for years.  Plus, I'm always gratified when knowledgable people reel off  their recommendations--their picks send me scurrying to used bookstores in search of  new treasures.<br />In their introduction, Messrs. Jones and Newman express their hope that the book is &quot;...informative and fun,&quot; also stating that it &quot;should offer a guide for the relative newcomer to the subject, but also some meat for the veteran afficionado.  We hope we've succeeded in giving a working overview of an often maligned field of literature.&quot;  I, for one, think they've achieved their goal--Horror:  100 Best Books is a worthwhuile addition to library of any horror maven, a useful, entertaining work that belongs on the shelf next to books like King's Danse Macabre, Winter's Faces of Fear, Skal's The Horror Show and Wiater's Dark Thoughts on Writing.	2001-08-22

Clarence Jefferson has spent his career collecting dirt on the rich and powerful.  Always wary, Jefferson has accumulated the incriminating evidence in two huge suitcases as insurance.  One day, Jefferson disappears and, after several months, is presumed dead.  He exerts his influence from beyond the grave, however, writing to his lover, the sultry heiress Lena Parillaud, and to the last man who saw him alive, Dr. Cicero Grimes.  The letters provide clues to the whereabouts of the suitcases, triggering a desperate search which eventually involves the feisty WWII veteran George Grimes (Cicero's father), seedy attorney Rufus Atwater, Lena's estranged husband Filmore Faroe (recently escaped after 13 years from a prison his loving wife had made for him), and Ella MacDaniels, a young woman who unknowingly stands at the center of the mystery.  Before book's end, alliances are made and broken, bullets fly, and several players lose their lives.<br />Willocks delivers a riveting novel, a southern gothic replete with buckets of blood and philosophical musings.  Willocks knows his terrain as well as James Ellroy knows L.A.,  and is equally unafraid to expose its dark underbelly.  Frightening and hypnotic, grotesque and suspenseful, Bloodstained Kings is one of those books that grabs you and doesn't let go--Willocks provides memorable, three dimensionsal characters, sharp dialogue and rich atmosphere, weaving his protagonists' disparate lives togther with enviable skill.  An unusual, unforgettable novel, a worthy successor to his previous effort, the gritty Green River Rising.	2001-08-22

In his introduction to &quot;The Territory,&quot; the opening story of One Day Closer to Death, author Bradley Denton states:<br />&quot; The greatest moment in all of American literature occurs in chapter 31 of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when Huck says---  'All right then, I'll go to hell.'  And he tears up a certain piece of paper.&quot; *<br />*A letter he had written to Jim's owner, Mrs. Watson, revealing Jim's whereabouts.<br />Later, Denton says that that moment set the &quot;literary high bar&quot; for him as a writer, that henceforth his goal would be to give readers the same kind of epiphany he felt when Huck made his decision.<br />If you've read Denton's novels, you know that he usually meets this lofty goal.  One Day Closer to Death, featuring seven previously published stories and one new novella, proves he also meets this standard in his shorter work.  Composed of various milestones from his thirteen-year career, each story contains characters who face personal hells, some forced on them by circumstance, others self created.<br />The collection's strongest stories are three novellas, &quot;The Territory&quot;, &quot;The Calvin Coolidge Home for Dead Comedians&quot;, and &quot;Blackburn Bakes Cookies&quot;.  &quot;The Territory&quot; (an alternate history that will surprise readers who think Howard Waldrop holds exclusive rights to this type of story), relates young Sam Clemens' experiences as a member of Quantrill's raiders, and the choice he is forced to make when that savage band decides to invade the abolitionist stronghold of Lawrence, Kansas. &quot;The Calvin Coolidge Home for Dead Comedians&quot;, features the controversial Lenny Bruce, who, after his tawdry death, discovers that the line between heaven and hell is very thin.  &quot;Blackburn Bakes Cookies&quot;, provides a fitting epitaph to the Jimmy Blackburn saga.  Although not physically present (unless you count his ashes), Blackburn's presence pervades this twisted tale of family ties and hero worship.<br />Rounding out the collection are &quot;Skidmore&quot; (wherein the ghost of a serial killer accompanies the story's narrator on a grim trek), &quot;Killing Weeds&quot; (a story of the continuing ravages of the Vietnam War), &quot;Captain Coyote's Last Hunt&quot; (in which a sadistic hunter gets his comeuppance from the Trickster himself), &quot;We Love Lydia Love&quot;, (a tale of obsessive love and self destruction which could have easily come out of Ellison's &quot;Love Ain't Nothing But Sex Misspelled&quot;), and &quot;A Conflagration Artist&quot; (about a woman shares her personal tragedy with others via combustible performance art).<br />The stories are arranged chronologically, so readers can, in Denton's words, &quot;see his evolution as a writer&quot;.  They show an author constantly refining his gifts, constantly improving, constantly pushing literary boundaries.

This volume was originally intended to be a reprint of Kessel's Arkham House collection &quot;Meeting in Infinity&quot;.  In its final form, however, it includes only nine stories from that earlier volume. Instead, The Pure Product, in Kessel's words, &quot;is a collection of stories that do not exist as portions of either Freedom Beach or Good News from Outer Space.&quot;  Thus we are presented with seven previously uncollected tales, one dramatic adaptation, one new story, and two poems.<br />The most intriguing stories in The Pure Product here are those which deal with alternate realities.  Readers are first treated to a short biography of 1930s science fiction writer Herman Melville (&quot;Herman Melville:  Space Opera Virtuoso&quot;).  In &quot;The Franchise&quot;, Fidel Castro and George Bush play baseball, not politics, but nevertheless find themselves engaged in battle.  Finally, Kessel presents a bittersweet meeting between his own father and H. G. Wells in &quot;Buffalo&quot;.<br />Of course, The Pure Product contains examples of Kessel's trademark humor and wit.  Entries such as &quot;The Einstein Express&quot; (wherein the protagonist learns about relativity firsthand), and &quot;Man&quot; (a story about a homeowner with a unique &quot;pest&quot; in his basement) will raise smiles.  Also included is the hilarious &quot;Faustfeathers&quot;, a play in two acts which can be described, as the title suggests, as Dr. Faustus meets the Marx Brothers.<br />These lighthearted pieces are balanced by some with darker premises.  Thus, we have the philosophical &quot;Buddha Nostril Bird&quot; and &quot;Animals&quot;, as well as the Bradbury-like &quot;The Lecturer&quot;.  &quot;Not responsible!  Park it and Lock it!&quot; posits a bleak future where the American love affair with the automobile has been taken to a ridiculous extreme.  &quot;A Clean Escape&quot; reflects on responsibility and culpability. &quot;Invaders&quot;, contrasts Pizarro's conquest of the Incas with a bona fide alien invasion.  Finally, &quot;Hearts Do Not in Eyes Shine&quot;, a poignant tale of memory, trust, and betrayal, and &quot;Gulliver at Home&quot;, which tells what the neighbors REALLY thought about the tales Lemuel Gulliver brought home, are revealing tales of married love.<br />The collection also features three of Kessel's unique brand of time travel stories. &quot;The Pure Product&quot; feels like a science fiction version of Natural Born Killers (published in 1986, it actually preceded that movie).  The other two appear to be companion pieces to his recent novel Corrupting Dr. Nice.  &quot;Some Like it Cold&quot; features a disconsolate Marilyn Monroe, saved from suicide and brought to the future, only to be returned to the lifestyle that destroyed her.  &quot;The Miracle of Ivar Avenue&quot; tells a tale of murder and deceit featuring Preston Sturges, the film director who influenced much of Kessel's work.<br />If The Pure Product demonstrates anything, it is that Kessel is unclassifiable.  There's a little bit of everything here, from time travel to alternate realities, comedy to tragedy.  Kessel has said that, as a boy, he read science fiction both for escape and for its ability to inspire &quot;the proverbial sense of wonder.&quot;  The stories in The Pure Product will afford many other readers that same opportunity.cas with a bona fide alien invasion.

In keeping with the spirit of this collection of short shorts, billed as a &quot;picture book for grownups,&quot; I'll try to keep this brief.  The stories in this collection,  all classified under one of four catagories (Love Stories, Crime and Mystery, Not Quite S.F., and Off the Wall) are consistently intriguing, running the gamut from subtle to brash, outrageous to poignant, macabre to mundane.  Flensed of unnecessary detail, Rogers ' telling vignettes force readers to fill in the blanks, allowing their own points of view to act upon the prose.  Thus, the reading experience is transformed into a true collaborative effort, a joint venture where Rogers' imagination blends with that of his audience.  Forsaking the luxury of a slow buildup, Rogers plunges his readers into various worlds, makes his points, then leaves as quickly as he came, leaving the reader to marvel at what he has just experienced.  The stories in Flaming Arrows affirm that reading is indeed alchemy, proving once and for all that, at least in writing, size doesn't matter.  It's a lesson that many of Rogers' peers need to learn.	2001-08-20

Using the resumes he receives in response to the ad, Burke identifies his rivals for the real job.  Then, working his way along &quot;the learning curve of murder&quot;, Burke methodically hunts and executes them, in hopes of reducing his competition.<br />Westlake walks a fine line, but manages to make Burke a sympathetic character--it's hard not to feel for Burke, a killer who weeps for his victims and rejoices when a potential target finds a job.  But it's also hard not to be scared by his methodical ways, his casual brutality, and his rationalizations for murder.  Relentless and oh so very plausible, this book should shake even the most jaded reader.	2001-08-20

Kate McDolen, severely depressed by an unhappy home life and faltering teaching career, seeks salvation in what her troubled mind tells her is a selfless act.  When Kate encounters second grader Mistie Dawn Henderson, an obvious victim of child abuse, she kidnaps her, vowing to save the child from further abuse.<br />But fate intervenes as she initiates her poorly conceived plan.  Kate and her young charge are taken hostage by &quot;Tony,&quot; a bitter teenage girl whose own frustrations have led her to rob a local gas station at gunpoint. Thus is formed a strange family unit consisting of the teacher and the two children, all victims of varying forms of abuse.  Ostensibly traveling to Texas so that Tony can be reunited with her absentee father, the trio begins a journey that will lead them to face their destinies.<br />Written with energy, gravity and grace, Wire Mesh Mothers is superior work from a superior stylist.  Told from the rotating viewpoints of the three scarred heroines, it is a grim tale of despair and redemption, a trek through a wasteland of abuse and shattered lives.  Although the initial theme seems to be that no good deed goes unpunished, Massie's overriding messages of hope, redemption and the importance of family ultimately emerge as the narrative moves towards its riveting and moving finale.<br />Wire Mesh Mothers is one of the most absorbing novels I've read in a long time, both for the story it tells and for its objective consideration of the effects of almost overwhelming social problems.  At heart a thriller, it's also a compassionate report from America's heartland, populated by realistic characters who run a gamut of emotions, characters who are by turns sad, courageous, funny, pathetic and monstrous.  Propelled by Massie's precise and insightful prose, ear for dialogue, knack for telling detail, and penchant for risk taking, the narrative will overwhelm you if you let it, so powerful is the story at its center.  At times one might conclude that the author is telling us that &quot;Life is hard, then you die.&quot;  Indeed, Massie suggests that to be a woman in America is to endure special burdens. Yet she also suggests that in the bleakness there is hope, as long as we continue to reach out to one another.ude that the author is telling us that &quot;Life is hard, then you die.&quot;  Indeed, Massie suggests that to be a woman in America is to endure special burdens.

That's not the case with Sleepeasy, as the chief protagonist's death is merely the beginning of one of the strangest road trips ever chronicled.<br />After passing away, Harry Briggs finds himself in another reality, which he slowly comes to realize must be the afterlife.  Rather than heaven or hell or limbo, the hereafter seems to be what each individual makes of it, composed of the people and setting most important to that individual.  It seems also that each person's afterlife is unique.<br />Breaking the mold, Harry becomes a distinct part of his deceased wife's reality.  Already an anomaly, Harry creates further trouble when, pursuing his afterlife fantasy of becoming a private detective, he creates an unearthly serial killer so powerful that he is able to cross back into the &quot;real&quot; world, where he begins to fulfill his murderous destiny. Harry travels back to set things straight and subdue his creation.<br />It wouldn't be fair to reveal any more details about the book--I'll leave those pleasurable discoveries to you.  Sleepeasy is a clever, witty, thoughtful novel if there ever was one, and finds the author at the top of his considerable form.  Wright hooks his readers within the first four pages and never relinquishes his grip--the audience is ready to follow Harry anywhere, and that's just where Wright takes them, providing plenty of food for thought along the way.  With its take on the afterlife as unique and powerful as Richard Matheson's What Dreams May Come, Sleepeasy is a book you'll hate to put down.	2001-08-17
US	52836712	R2VPW507J5UFT3	0843948760	13657707	The Lost	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A blast from the recent past, 1969 to be exact.	On the surface, The Lost is about the escalating conflict between a murderous sociopath and a zealous lawman.  Look closely, however, and you'll find a book dealing with questions about the nature of love, the price of loyalty, and the difficulty of facing overwhelming personal and cultural upheaval.  Gripping due to the constant potential for sudden violence (this is a Ketchum novel, after all), The Lost thrills as much for its psychological and emotional richness as it does for its pervasive violence and suspense.<br /><br />The tale begins in 1965 with an act of sudden, unexpected carnage when sociopath Ray Pye shoots two female campers in cold blood after one of the pair rejects his pitiful romantic advances.  The vicious attack, witnessed by Pye's stunned companions, Tim Bess and Jennifer Fitch, leaves one woman dead, the other in a coma.<br /><br />It is the death of the second camper in 1969 that signals the true beginning of Ketchum's story.  We discover that Sparta, New Jersey Police Detective Charlie Shilling has spent the past four years searching for evidence linking Pye to the crime.  Bess and Fitch have kept their silence, perhaps from a sense of misguided loyalty, perhaps out of love.  Pye, practically daring Shilling to arrest him, has also kept his cool, sticking to a story the detective can't contradict.  Frustrated by his failure, Shilling intentionally provokes Pye, finally pushing the mentally unstable killer over the edge.  Using the same weapons he carried that fateful night four years earlier, Pye takes gruesome revenge on his real and imagined enemies.<br /><br />In tone The Lost recalls Red, but, unlike that book, has a much broader scope.  Ketchum purposefully adopts a slower pace, so as to more completely explore the complexities of his numerous characters' personalities and relationships.  The small vacation town of Sparta acts as a microcosm of the country, as the characters deal with the unpleasant reality of random violence as part of everyday American life -- suddenly, it's not something that only happens in the big city (the Tate-LaBianca killings perpetrated by the Manson family are prominently mentioned, inspiring Ray Pye to further mayhem). As such, it also holds a mirror up to today's world as well, where children practice drills to prepare them for the eventuality of their peers shooting up the school.  It takes courage to look into that mirror, but Ketchum's never been one to flinch from unpleasant tasks.  He exposes the lies we tell ourselves so we can rest easy at night in the knowledge that it couldn't possibly happen here.e -- suddenly, it's not something that only happens in the big city (the Tate-LaBianca killings perpetrated by the Manson family are prominently mentioned, inspiring Ray Pye to further mayhem).

I really can't say enough good things about this fascinating study of Straub's fiction, which, to the best of my knowledge, is the first of its kind.  Sheehan tackles Straub's oeuvre with great intelligence and verve, providing new insights into an author whom I only thought I knew well.<br />Beginning with Marriages, and ending with Mr. X, Sheehan delivers an affectionate, but rigorous inquiry, celebrating Straubs triumphs, but also gently taking him to task for his occasional excesses and misfires.  Sheehan also brings his considerable knowledge of the genre into play, as when he recounts a 1981 exchange between Straub and an interviewer at NECON that Straub himself had forgotten.  In Sheehan's own words,<br />\\"The interviewer asked Straub the arch and somewhat overly clever question, \\"What's the worst thing you've ever done?\\"  Without missing a beat, Straub replied, \\"The worst thing I ever did was kill off Sears James.  I loved him very much.\\"<br />While Sheehan's chapters are uniformly excellent (hell, he single-handedly rekindled my interest in \\"Floating Dragon,\\" a book I had heretofore viewed as a disappointment), he's at his best in his extensive, incisive exploration of Straub's Blue Rose Trilogy, comprised of Koko, Mystery, and The Throat.  Sheehan deftly navigates those (purposely) muddied waters, making sense of the complex triptych and associated short stories, ultimately tying everything together in his chapter on The Throat.  Here's a sampling from the first paragraph of Sheehan's chapter on that novel:<br />\\"The Throat, more than any of Straub's previous novels, is the literary equivalent of an extended jazz solo: a long, sinuous composition that circles and recycles a familiar series of themes, scenes, and characters, improvising its way toward a number of revelations that retrospectively illuminate the central events of both Koko and Mystery.  In fact, the primary impetus behind the writing of The Throat was Straub's belief that he had not yet exhausted the emotional content of those books, and that their central elements--the war in Vietnam, the auto accident, his concern with the grief, bitterness and buried rage that are the frequent after-effects of childhood traumas--virtually demanded further elaboration.  Added to this was Straub's obvious affection for the characters he had lived with for the past five years, particularly that battle -scarred survivor, Tim Underhill.\\"<br />This paragraph is illustrative of the depth and poise of Sheehan's analysis and writing; the good news is that the rest is consistently excellent.<br />Coming to the end of this review, a quote from Straub himself springs to mind.  Describing his respect for Stephen King, he once said:<br />\\"...it was clear that if I had an ideal reader anywhere in the world, it was probably Stephen King...\\"<br />If asked today, I'd suspect that Straub might respond that his number of ideal readers worldwide has at least doubled.exhausted the emotional content of those books, and that their central elements--the war in Vietnam, the auto accident, his concern with the grief, bitterness and buried rage that are the frequent after-effects of childhood traumas--virtually demanded further elaboration.

Through Oona, they meet Charley and Jan O'Donnell, another couple who believes they are receiving messages from their infant daughter who died tragically in a fire.  This eclectic mix of personalities generates disturbing results, as dark crimes from both the past and present are unearthed through Oona's traumatic seances.  The truths revealed test the parties involved, driving them to madness, despair, and death.<br />A book which promptly landed on many reviewers' short list for best novel of 1998, Fogheart is first rate work from a major talent.  Tessier casts a dark spell through his gripping narrative--his characters live and breathe, the dialogue shines, and the atmosphere of dread he creates will unnerve even the most jaded reader.  Fogheart proves that horror is alive and well, demonstrating that a familiar premise can gain new life in the hands of a capable writer.  If Tessier remains &quot;horror fiction's best kept secret&quot; after this one, there is simply no justice.	2001-08-15

Dan Sloane.  John Talbot.<br />Give up?  Ardent Lansdale fans may recognize the Slater moniker, but I'd bet most of you are hard pressed to come up with anything on the other two.  Here's the answer: each is a fictional private detective, created by Joe R. Lansdale, Lewis Shiner, or both. All starred in early attempts by the authors to write hard boiled mysteries, and all first appeared in Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine in the late seventies and early eighties.<br />Private Eye Action As You Like It (the title is based on an in-joke between Lansdale and Shiner) presents eight stories featuring these characters-three Slater tales by Lansdale, three Sloane adventures from Shiner, and two collaborative efforts starring Talbot.  Typical of the men's action-adventure genre, they bear titles like &quot;Long Gone, Forever,&quot; &quot;One Blonde, Well Dead,&quot; &quot;Deep Without Pity,&quot; &quot;The Killing Season,&quot; and &quot;Black as the Night&quot;.  None of the stories are particularly stellar, but all are well written and entertaining, notable for the insight they provide into each writer's professional development and evolution of their particular voices.  All the stories contain flashes of the author they become-Lansdale, in naming a character Eclipse, &quot;on account of he's so big he blocks out the sun,&quot; and Shiner in his already polished prose.<br />From the tenor of their editorial remarks, I sensed both authors look back on these stories with a measure of disdain and affection.  This is to be expected, but the disdain is probably not justified.  Sometimes clumsy, sometimes amateurish, the stories represent the best work they could do at that stage in their careers, and as such are nothing to be ashamed about. So, in the final analysis, I'd have to say the collection is interesting primarily for its historical perspective, secondarily for the entertaining author's notes filled with insight and good natured ribbing between the two friends (Shiner's piece, &quot;Can You Run With It?&quot; is particularly funny).  As such, the book is primarily for Lansdale and Shiner completists, not for casual readers.  Even so, those unfamiliar with either author will find things to like.with insight and good natured ribbing between the two friends (Shiner's piece, &quot;Can You Run With It?&quot; is particularly funny).

SPOILER ALERT: Contains in depth discussion of key plot points!<br /><br />\\"...your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions...\\" Joel, 3:3<br /><br />In 1979, I discovered the novels of a guy named Stephen King and began reading more extensively in the horror genre. On the prowl for something similar, I happened on Straub's book in the library. I checked it out, little realizing that I had begun a decades long love affair with his work. It's now been almost twenty years since I read it the first time--I've read hundreds of books since then, but few thrilled me like Ghost Story.<br /><br />Rereading it now, I realize the depth of Straub's accomplishment. Like the legendary storytellers to whom he pays homage, Straub has created a timeless tale of terror, an enduring classic. Reduced to its essentials, Ghost Story is a tale of supernatural revenge. As young men, Ricky Hawthorne, Sears James, Edward Wanderly, Lewis Benedikt and John Jaffrey accidentally kill a woman named Eva Galli. They panic, and decide to cover up her death. Placing her body in a borrowed car, they push the vehicle into a nearby lake. As the car sinks into the muck, they see a sight that haunts them for the rest of their lives: for a moment, it appears as if Eva is still alive, as they catch a glimpse of her face through the rear window. Shaken, they vow to keep her death a secret, and go on with their lives.<br /><br />Fifty years later, the group still lives in their hometown of Milburn, NY, prosperous and content. Now known as The Chowder Society, they meet on a regular basis to swap ghost stories, but they never speak of Eva. Then, Edward Wanderly dies during a party given in the honor of an actress named Anne-Veronica Moore, apparently of fright. The remaining members experience a series of prophetic dreams in which several of them die. Unable to admit to themselves that Eva Galli has returned to haunt them, they send for Don Wanderley, Ed's nephew. A writer by trade, Don has penned a horror novel called The Nightwatcher, based, we later learn, on his own experiences with Eva, known to him as Alma Mobley.<br /><br />Don's arrival in Milburn seems to send a signal to the evil which threatens the group, resulting in the deaths of two more of their number. The survivors band with Don and Peter Barnes, a young man whose mother has been killed by Eva and her minions. Together they struggle to locate and destroy their nemesis.<br /><br />Straub sets the tone for the novel from its first sentences, which express a thought repeated throughout the book. Readers are immediately confronted with the question, \\"What's the worst thing you've ever done?,\\" followed by the response, \\"I won't tell you that, but I'll tell you the worst thing that ever happened to me...the most dreadful thing...\\" Readers are filled with anticipation, wondering what the dreadful thing could be. Straub then proceeds to explore what Stephen King called \\"a very Jamesian theme...the idea that ghosts, in the end, adopt the motivations and perhaps the very souls of those who behold them.\\" Straub leaves it unclear whether Eva/Alma/Anne Veronica could exist without her victims' belief to sustain her--we never know whether her existence is independent, symbiotic, or totally dependent on those she is out to destroy. Straub's clues muddy the waters, as when Eva and another shapeshifter are asked, \\"Who are you?\\" Their answer, \\"I am you, \\" is maddening and ambiguous.<br /><br />Numerous readings reveal how much the book owes to Salem's Lot. Straub has publicly acknowledged this debt, stating that \\"I wanted to work on a large canvas. Salem's Lot showed me how to do this without getting lost among a lot of minor characters. Besides the large canvas I also wanted a certain largeness of effect. I had been imbued with the notion that horror stories are best when they are ambiguous and low key and restrained. Reading Salem's Lot, I realized that the idea was self defeating.\\"<br /><br />On reflection, the debt to Salem's Lot is obvious. Both feature small towns under siege from the supernatural. In both, the terror escalates until the towns are threatened with destruction--Jerusalem's Lot is consumed by purifying fire, while Milburn is decimated. In each, a writer's arrival in town seems to trigger disaster. Both writers strike up alliances with young teenagers whose lives are ruined by the terror, Ben Mears with Mark Petrie and Don Wanderly with Peter Barnes. Both forge an almost parental bond with their young allies, replacing those lost parents. In both, the evil lives on--Ben and Mark end up on the run, while Don, after ending the threat of Eva, presumably goes off to face her evil aunt.<br /><br />In the end, however, Salem's Lot was merely a template, a guide which opened Straub's eyes more fully to the possibilities of horror. Ghost Story is a marriage of two sensibilities: King's, from which it derives its more operatic moments, and Straub's, in that it thoroughly fulfills his literary ambition to expand the boundaries of the traditional ghost story. It also stands as perhaps the first example of Straub's trademark exploration of the power of stories, of the capacity of stories to uncover the truth. Much as King's book stands as a tribute to writers like Bram Stoker and Richard Matheson, Straub's stands as a tribute to writers specifically referenced in the book (Hawthorne, Henry James) and those not (like Poe, Irving, Lovecraft, Bierce and M. R. James) but whose influence is there nonetheless.<br /><br />Recently, I had the vicarious pleasure of watching my thirteen year old daughter Leigh read this wonderful book for the first time.

His grueling, demanding job has taken its toll;  the misery he sees every day has overwhelmed him, causing hallucinations.  Haunted by past mistakes and failures, Frank has visions of the people he couldn't save.  The ghosts he sees are as real to him as his partners, a colorful group of guys who, believe it or not, have even stranger problems than Frank.  Torn apart by a tragic past and a surreal present, Frank struggles to maintain his sanity.<br />I had  a strong reaction to this one, perhaps due to the time I spent on a first aid squad in my youth.  Connelly, an ex-NY City medic, captures the dark side of being a good samaritan--you constantly see people at their worst.  He also depicts the sad truth that drives people away from this kind of work--you can't save everyone.  This first novel, a mix of elements from books like M*A*S*H, Ulysses, Catcher in the Rye, and A Manhattan Ghost Story, pulls no punches.  Connelly paints a bleak picture in surprisingly mature prose, pulling readers into Frank's dark, paranoiac existence.  Patrick McGrath (author of Asylum) says it best:  &quot;The author's vision is both bleak and compassionate;  his control of his explosive material is masterly.  This is strong stuff, full of heart, engaging, harrowing, and real.&quot;  Don't miss it.	2001-08-15

I'm one of the co-authors, so I have nothing but good things to say about the book.  Don't take my word for it, however.  Publishers Weekly liked the SKU, and so did the Library Journal, among others.  But my favorite comments so far come from noted King scholar Stephen J. Spignesi, author of THE COMPLETE STEPHEN KING ENCYCLOPEDIA, THE LOST WORK OF STEPHEN KING, and THE ESSENTIAL STEPHEN KING.  I'd like to share them with you.<br />Stephen Spignesi on the SKU:<br />A thought occurred to me while reading THE STEPHEN KING UNIVERSE. It occurred to me that this book might be one of the single most important books about Stephen King ever written.<br />Why?<br />Because it not only proceeds from the assumption that King's work is worthy of intensive, comprehensive study,  but it also puts his entire body of work within a specific context.  It treats his lifetime of writing as a Master's Catalog of Art that can be looked at as a single entity, regardless of the varying degrees of excellence present in individual works. Beginning with the premise that all of King's work is intertwined in an intricate weave of overlapping narrative threads, with the world of the DARK TOWER as the linchpin around which everything else orbits, Wiater, Golden, and Wagner carefully prove their point, in an entertaining, intriguing, and, thoroughly indisputable way.<br />Is there another 20th/21st century writer whose work is worthy of such deconstruction? Of course...but the names on THAT list are going to be John Irving, Tom Wolfe, Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, John Updike, Joyce Carol Oates, Thomas Pynchon, etc.,  NOT the best-selling &quot;popular&quot; writers that are often mentioned in the same breath as Stephen King and with whom he often shares spots on the best-seller lists.<br />THE STEPHEN KING UNIVERSE is as important a book as Douglas Winter's seminal STEPHEN KING: THE ART OF DARKNESS, which paved the way for the rest of us, we Chroniclers of the King. THE STEPHEN KING UNIVERSE is a major contribution to the field of scholarship about King, and King's  fans should be grateful that Stan Wiater, Chris Golden, and Hank Wagner - a truly talented and insightful drawing of the three -- have done the kind of work it took to research and write THE STEPHEN KING UNIVERSE.<br />Hank Wagner back again:  Be careful Steve, you'll turn our heads!NIVERSE is a major contribution to the field of scholarship about King, and King's  fans should be grateful that Stan Wiater, Chris Golden, and Hank Wagner - a truly talented and insightful drawing of the three -- have done the kind of work it took to research and write THE STEPHEN KING UNIVERSE.<br />Hank Wagner back again:  Be careful Steve, you'll turn our heads!	2001-05-18

Walking home from church, six year old Amy Priestly grips her parents' hands tightly as they approach Nazareth Hill, an ancient, burnt out structure that looms over the city of Partington.  Despite her parent's presence, Amy is uneasy, certain the house is interested in her.  Wanting her to confront her fear, her father swings her onto his shoulders and forces her to look through a shattered window.  Inside, Amy sees a ghastly creature reaching for her--shocked, she nearly topples from her perch.  Knowing they won't understand, she never tells her parents about what she witnessed.<br /> Ten years later, that incident long forgotten, Amy and her widowed father move into Nazareth Hill, now a luxury apartment building.  Accustomed to being at odds with her dad because of her bizarre appearance and attitudes, she at first dismisses his increasingly erratic behavior.  When he becomes more dictatorial, and adopts the speech patterns of a bygone era, she wonders if their new home is causing the problem.  Curious, Amy looks into the building's past , discovering its disquieting history.  Built on a site sacred to witches, the building formerly housed an insane asylum, where inmates were brutalized.<br /> Amy comes to realize that past events have imprinted themselves on the house, and that its current occupants are replaying the obscene dramas that took place within its walls.  By the time her father's discipline becomes persecution, it's too late.  Overcome by madness, Mr. Priestly imprisons Amy in her room.  Cut off from the rest of the world, Amy fights to stay sane and alive.<br /> This novel, squarely in the tradition of The Haunting of Hill House and The Shining, reworks traditional subject matter while addressing timeless issues.  Campbell focuses on the persecution of the outsider, demonstrating that those who are different will always be subject to scorn, derision and abuse.  In the 1700s it was witches; in the 1800s it was the mentally ill.  In our century, it is people like Amy, who has chosen to adopt a punk/goth lifestyle.  Her attitudes and strange appearance make her an easy target for the citizens of Partington, and gives the evil in Nazareth Hill something to exploit.<br /> The book is especially noteworthy due to Campbell's talents as a stylist.  In a time where many authors choose to write down to their audience, Campbell's prose is a breath of fresh air.  Campbell's writing demands (and earns) a reader's attention--each word is carefully chosen for maximum impact.  He creates an atmosphere of fear word by word, building towards the novel's tragic conclusion.<br /> Of course, there's plenty of gruesome stuff going on too--cats are hung, tongues are amputated, and specters stalk the living--but Campbell doesn't rely solely on shock to create fear. A craftsman, he builds to these shocks, wringing the maximum emotional impact from each scene.  By the time readers turn the last page, they'll be worn out, but may have gained some insight into the nature of prejudice.
