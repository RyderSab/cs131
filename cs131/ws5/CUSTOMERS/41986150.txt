And if you have played through the game, then the plot points in this novel won't lend you any surprises. It is, however, a testament to William Dietz's prowess as an author that even Halo veterans such as myself can pick up this book and still be interested in the subject matter. As with \\"Fall of Reach\\", \\"The Flood\\" fleshes out the Halo universe even further. Not only do you follow Master Chief as he fights the Covenent, the Flood and Guilty Spark 243 on the Jovian-orbiting ringworld of Halo, but you get up close and personal with some of the ODSTs (Helljumpers, who will play a large part in Halo 2), marines and non-coms who are aiding Master Chief in the fight. You even get to see the fight from the Covenant point of view.<br /><br />William Dietz was a fine choice for creating this novelization. Already an excellent military sci-fi author, he does great work here in turning a potentially lackluster novelization into something interesting and special.	2005-09-05

I had a hard time finishing this novel.<br /><br />This is not to say \\"Orphan's Destiny\\" is a bad book. Far from it. In my review of \\"Orphanage\\", I complained about Buettner ripping off his betters by borrowing themes and plot-points from the novels \\"The Forever War\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\". I'd hoped that \\"Destiny\\" would be a more original tome. Well, wish granted. It suffers by lacking a desperate kineticism, with humaniny on the brink of extinction, but brings to the table something that is sorely lacking in military-sci-fi.<br /><br />One thing you don't see much of in military sci-fi are extended examinations of fictional post-war Earths. Here, Jason Wander returns to Earth hardly able to believe his eyes. The world's various governments are trying to come to terms with the destruction left behind after the war with the \\"Slugs\\". Earth is suffering from a near-nuclear winter and the deaths of 600 million of its inhabitants. The US Government is leading a push to return to a peace-time economy and leaning on General Wander to get on board with its PR blitz. But is it a smart move? Is the Slug threat really over? You can answer that question for yourself just by reading the first chapter.<br /><br />Thankfully, Buettner's laconic and wiseacre prose is much polished from his previous novel. His tendancy to telegraph future events by ending chapters with \\"I was wrong\\" or \\"I didn't get the rest I was hoping for\\" remains. After 10 chapters of this, it gets to be an annoying device.<br /><br />The most enjoyable aspect of the novel (for me) was watching Wander slip from a war-time role into that of peace-time. But, lets face it, not much happens until the middle of the book. Much time is spent with Wander regretting the loss of 9000 of his comrades-in-arms, crying occasionally and wondering \\"why did I survive\\"? I felt a huge opportunity was lost with Buettner glossing over Wander's relationship with Munchkin's young son.<br /><br />But, eh...by and large, its a fun book. I'm glad to see that Buettner is trying on his own themes for a change. They're a good fit., its a fun book. I'm glad to see that Buettner is trying on his own themes for a change.

US	41986150	R3TOJFOJB5KNV8	0743487850	425555121	Bad Men: A Thriller	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Certainly true to its title	Short review here. I picked up this book at the local King Soopers because I didn't want to spend my lunch hour with nothing to do. Frankly, I was blown away by it, finishing it over the next three days of almost sleepless nights and lunch hours that nearly made me late for work.<br /><br />Connolly is an expert practitioner in the art of Characterization. Even when his plotting fails him (which isn't often), his characters pull him through. Despite the fact that the majority of these characters revel in extremes (Joe Dupree, the gentle giant of a cop, is Very Good, and Molloch, the book's main baddie, is Very Bad), Connolly makes them live and breath. Every character has a convincing backstory. Even the \\"backwoods retard\\" killer Willard (think the banjo kid from \\"Deliverance\\", but with pretty eyes) comes complete with a history. Most authors would stop at a physical description. This is not enough for Connolly, and this book is so much the better for it.<br /><br />\\"Bad Men\\" has a pervading sense of melancholy running throughout its length, only enhanced by the epic history of Dutch Island (Sanctuary) created by Connolly. The story jumps around alot, one moment talking about the distant past (17th century), then a few years before current events in the novel, etc... He creates a house of cards that you swear will fall down around him. But he keeps it all upright and only brings it down when its good and ready.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers said, this book is filled with gore and extreme acts of sadism. Everyone comes away from the experience with scars. Innocents are harmed. Children are threatened. But then, what would you expect from a book called \\"Bad Men\\"?	2005-06-15
US	41986150	R339MC5KUBGGIJ	0345462858	530685496	The God Particle: A Novel	Books	3	7	11	N	N	A decent effort, but Robert Sawyer did it better	Another reviewer here mentioned this novel is NOT sci-fi. This is definately true. At best, its fantasy. At worst, its a messy collection of contemporary physics theories the author fashions together in a semblance of a plot.<br /><br />The primary character of this novel, Mike McNair, is the research head of a superconducting supercollider in Texas, leading a group of physicists on a search for the elusive Higgs Boson, the subatomic particle that confers mass to ordinary matter.<br /><br />The secondary character, Steve Keeley, is an automobile exec on the rise. Traumatized by the discovery that his soon-to-be-fiancee is cheating on him, Keeley goes to visit a brothel while on a business trip overseas. He is attacked, sustains a horrible head injury and is \\"saved\\" by a brilliant neurosurgeon. But upon waking from his coma and returning to the US, Keeley begins to sense a \\"field\\", through which he can read minds, possibly even influence matter itself.<br /><br />Saying anymore would do a disservice to potential readers. Suffice it to say, Keeley and McNair are on a collison course.<br /><br />\\"The God Particle\\" suffers from many of the typical failings of first time authors - lack of characterization, a large number of plot holes, poorly described motivations - despite the fact that this is Cox's 2nd novel. Cox's description of the \\"field\\" that Keeley senses leaves much to be desired. The romantic sub-plot where-in McNair falls in love with a local TV newsanchor goes nowhere. Some characters exist solely to make McNair's life difficult. Their motivations are preposterous when explained. There's not even a hint of authenticity in the manner in which science is conducted in this book. As a biochemistry student, \\"The God Particle\\" difficult to read without wincing.<br /><br />However, \\"The God Particle\\" does move at breakneck speed, despite being comprised mostly of characters standing around talking to each other about God and physics. These conversations are interesting, but seem to exist solely to preach science and dogma at the reader.<br /><br />Several years ago, Robert Sawyer wrote the novel \\"Flashback\\", another story revolving around the search for the Higgs Boson. Both books fall into the catagory of \\"Science Gone Awry\\", but Sawyer did it better. At least his world, despite being subjected to otherworldly events, felt grounded in reality.ns are interesting, but seem to exist solely to preach science and dogma at the reader. <br /> <br />Several years ago, Robert Sawyer wrote the novel \\"Flashback\\", another story revolving around the search for the Higgs Boson.

US	41986150	R2QHG10S3PDP3V	0765309408	219777348	Old Man's War	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	Amazingly original first novel	Military sci-fi seems very chic as of late. Several months ago, \\"Orphanage\\" was released to significant fanfare and while its a good read, it can't hold a candle to its philosophical forebears - \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\". \\"Orphanage\\" simply doesn't bring enough originality to the genre.<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\", however, does bring some much-needed originality to the table. There are some obvious influences from Heinlein and Haldeman here, which mostly manifests itself in how Scalzi talks about attrition rates. And like \\"Starship Troopers\\", much of the novel is of people talking to one another about the universe they inhabit. This could have made the novel a boring mess, but Scalzi makes it interesting by making this universe interesting. He draws up characters rather than caricatures and you care about them, even as they are killed off one by one.<br /><br />The most original concept introduced in the novel is the idea of recruiting the old to fight humanity's enemies. He enhances the battle scenes of the novel by showing them from the perspective of a man who already lived out his normal lifespan, only to have another life dangled in front of him like a carrot....provided he survives. This provides a heightened sense of urgency to those battle scenes.<br /><br />There are plenty of other original concepts introduced within these pages, but all of them would be for naught if Scalzi didn't care about his characters. He does, and \\"Old Man's War\\" is a much better read for it.	2005-01-20
US	41986150	R1JJRIO1JT66TC	0765309386	202359861	Spin	Books	5	121	140	N	N	Your average excellent Robert Charles Wilson novel	I managed to snag an advanced copy of this novel last week, which I finished in about a day and a half reading during lunch breaks, bathroom breaks and the hours before bedtime. As per usual, Wilson does an excellent job of keeping me up at night.<br /><br />For those who are familiar with Robert Charles Wilson's work, \\"Spin\\" should come as no surprise. Most of his novels feature a conflicted protagonist who is caught up in storms of intrigue and extraordinary circumstances. Wilson's stories typically focus 70% on the characters and 30% on the science. His characters walk away from these experiences utterly changed, for better or for worse. Their arcs aren't always pleasant but usually realistic. You could easily put yourself into their shoes.<br /><br />\\"Spin\\" is no exception.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer pointed out, Wilson's one weakness is his endings. The endings are usually a rush to tie together loose ends, explain away anything that wasn't properly explained before. \\"Blind Lake\\" fell into this trap. \\"The Chronoliths\\" did not. Thankfully, \\"Spin\\" falls into the latter catagory.	2004-12-09
US	41986150	R32H2FWOVZ2LRI	0446614297	227648272	Orphanage	Books	3	134	146	N	N	A fun read, even if it does use every cliche of the genre	Like the other reviewers, I really enjoyed \\"Orphanage\\". But having read \\"The Forever War\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\" recently, I couldn't help but notice that most every major plot point or character stereotype in \\"Orphanage\\" was lifted from those two books.<br /><br />Talented space pilot who happens to be the main characters friend? Check (Starship Troopers). Human handlers psychicly and emotionally attached to a robot/dog scouting the front lines? Check (Starship Troopers). Main character emotionally attached to a female who gets wounded on the front lines? Check (Forever War). Evil aliens thowing large objects at Earth in order to soften us up? Check (Starship Troopers) Main character haunted by the death of a family member who happened to be at ground zero when said object hits Earth? Check (Starship Troopers). Main character part of the first assault wave against the aliens, only to be handed a crushing defeat? Check (both Starship Troopers and Forever War). Main character's military mentor tries to rejoin the front in time for battle? Check (Forever War).<br /><br />This list goes on and on, right down to the manner in which Jason Wander ends up in the military, with some minor variation. Granted, there are some trademark cliches of the genre that are simply unavoidable. But really, this seems a bit much. \\"Orphanage\\" reads like the redheaded stepchild of both of its superior forebears. There are some original elements to it, as Jason Wander becomes attached to military intelligence unit scouting a crashed alien Projectile on the moon. Or earlier on as Wander is sent into the remains of Pittsburgh searching for Projectile debris (including a subplot involving Wander's almost-psychic ability to find said debris, which is never followed up on).<br /><br />Again, \\"Orphanage\\" is a good read, and I am genuinely anticipating the sequel, which is promised in the author's biography. Hopefully, the sequel will be more original than this first volume.	2004-12-01

It talks about some of Valve's earlier visions before work on Half-Life consumed their offices. You'll get creative renderings of the evolution of most every adversary, friend, monster and location you'll come across in Half-Life 1 and 2, including bits and pieces that were removed from the games.<br /><br />But be warned - there are spoilers in this book. If you haven't finished Half Life 2 yet, put this one aside until you do.

Prima does an exhaustive job of detailing every nook and cranny of the game - from each appearance of the G-Man to each public service announcement made by Dr. Breen, from each ammo cache to each interesting newspaper clipping tacked to a wall.

Technically, it is not a sequel to \\"Revelation Space\\", but rather a fleshing out of the same universe.<br /><br />I won't waste your time going over plot details. \\"Chasm City\\" is a detective novel and revenge fantasy. Prepare to have your conceptions regarding almost every single character in the novel changed at least once. No one is who they seem. Its a great companion piece to Reynolds' overarching plot, but can be read on its own without having picked up \\"Revelation Space\\". However, some events and characters (ie - Sky Haussman and Sky's Edge are huge plot movers here, both of which are mentioned in \\"Revelation Space\\")<br /><br />Some reviewers say that Tanner Mirabel, the protagonist of \\"Chasm City\\", makes his way into the other books of the series. I can't say one way or the other, as I'm only 100 pages into \\"Redemption Ark\\". Still, \\"Chasm City\\" is a wonderful piece of sci-fi, taken on its own or as part of a series.	2004-10-17

It took me all of four minutes to get over my inhibitions and actually crack open this limited edition, 10 hours to read the entire book.<br /><br />It is certainly a disappointment. And certainly for those of us who have been here since the beginning. Right after \\"Wizard and Glass\\", Stephen King pulled the rug out from under us. Some might say that confounding our expectations is a good thing - it usually is. But I was struck by the extreme lack of imagination apparent in \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" - possibly the most longwinded book ever written. You figure that Stephen King would do a more complete job of grouping together his multiple universes, explain a bit more about where Randall Flagg fits in, Captain Tripps or the boy that everyone was protecting in \\"Insomnia\\". You expect him to tie it all together.<br /><br />And he does...in a way. I'm sure there will be plenty of DT fans out there who will NOT feel cheated as I did by certain startling omissions (where did Travellin' Jack go?). Something must have happened to King during that accident. It became imperitive to him to finish this series at all costs. Now that he has, I'm not so sure I wanted him to.	2004-09-19

Let the naysayers have their say, as they always do, and get yourself a copy. Because nearly 18 years of paying very close attention to this \\"Dark Tower\\" series thing is starting to pay off.<br />I will be the first to say that \\"Wizards and Glass\\" was much too long-winded and \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" was much too much of a turning point in the series for its own good. This book corrects (or nearly so) two problems I've come to associate with this series - a lack of brevity and a lack of velocity. Much of \\"Wolves\\" was Roland and his ka-tet sitting around waiting for the bad guys. Much of \\"Glass\\" was Roland getting musty-eyed about his lost love. We don't have such problems here. While there may be the occasional chapter devoted to a useless character or pages of exposition leading nowhere, I never got the feeling that the story was just standing still.<br />In truth, I fully expected to hate this book, if only for the manner in which King integrates himself into the story. I wanted to loathe it because it felt like such an artistically bankrupt thing to do. But rather than hate it, I came to enjoy it. The \\"Stephen King\\" that Stephen King writes about is humble rather egotistical, a man humiliated by his own mistakes. My biggest fear about King's self-integration was that, within the confines of the story, HE was the God, the creator of the DT universe. Most people I know felt the same way. And I'm happy to report, this fictionalized version of King is not God here, but an instrument. He is *compelled* to write about the Dark Tower and Roland and Eddie and Susannah and Jake.<br />Ultimately, King's intrusion into his own work is touching. His close call with the business end of a van has changed him and his fiction. Its about a man coming to terms with brushing so closely to Death, he came away smelling Death's aftershave.brushing so closely to Death, he came away smelling Death's aftershave.	2004-06-14

I've seen what Russo can do when he's at the top of his game (just pick up a copy of &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; and you'll get what I mean) and the three books that comprise this volume don't quite cut it.<br />This does not mean that &quot;Carlucci&quot; ain't worth the read. Far from it. Russo does a wonderful job sidestepping most all of the red-herrings and cliches that normally clutter the cyberpunk genre. Sure, there are a few here. Good cops going up against shadowy corporations. Police officers driven to alcoholism and suicide by the things they see on a daily basis. Etc...<br />Russo's 21st San Francisco occupies such a vivid world, generates such intense interest in the reader, that idiotic chase scenes, useless gunplay and overly graphic violence are all unnecessary. The intrigue, the characters, and the story are all that's needed. Russo delivers.<br />As I said before, &quot;Carlucci&quot; does not compare to Russo's masterwork, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;. Whereas &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; took on themes of spirituality, alienation and love (not to mention a decent dose of horror) and ran with them, the books collected in &quot;Carlucci&quot; are straightforward detective novels set in the future.<br />I have one complaint. The major character of the first &quot;Carlucci&quot; book, &quot;Destroying Angel&quot;, is NOT Frank Carlucci, but Louis Tanner, a burnt-out ex-cop who trafficks in illegal medicine. I liked Tanner. Alot. I felt a little cheated when the later books, &quot;Carlucci's Edge&quot; and &quot;Carlucci's Heart&quot; eschewed the Tanner character entirely. While Carlucci is interesting, he's a cop anti-stereotype. He's still married. Loves his family. Doesn't drink or smoke to excess and isn't given to violence as a way to solve his issues. In short, the man has some principles.

I can't say I was too enamored with the book back then. As with \\"Hyperion\\", you are immediately immersed in the conventions of the world long before those conventions make sense to you (ie - how long did it take you to figure out what the \\"fatline\\" was in the Hyperion Cantos?).<br />So the hardcover came out and being a Dan Simmons fan, I simply had to have it. And because it was just sitting there on the shelf, I just had to read it again. And like \\"Hyperion\\", I came to love this book.<br />I know a good many sci-fi fans that hold the Hyperion Cantos close to their hearts. I go back into my collection and read those four books at least once a year. Dan Simmons exhibits so much affection for his characters, you can't help but follow suit. While I cannot say I've been as big a fan of his horror and mystery novels, Simmons is back in true sci-fi form with \\"Ilium\\".<br />I'm not going to discuss the plot except to say it involves ancient greek gods, highly \\"evolved\\" demi-humans, a resurrected 20th century history teacher, a band of Eloi-like humans undertaking a trip of discovery across a shattered Earth, and a group of sentient machines traveling through the solar system to investigate some strange signals on the planet Mars. Again, Simmons makes his characters familiar to us. No matter if the plot sometimes goes haywires, the characters archor us to the story despite implausablilities.<br />I do have to wonder if this book isn't an addition to the Hyperion Cantos. ARNists are mentioned in both series. You got instant teleportation through what might be Planck space, again in both series. The plot somewhat involves some malfeasence involving Earth. Another character is called \\"The Wandering Jew\\". Where is Simmons going with all this?<br />With that, I'm eagerly awaiting the second volume in this series.	2003-09-05

A singularly absurd character. Rich beyond measure, cultured beyond belief, dressed implacably in a six thousand dollar suit, with rather expensive culinary tastes to boot. He is also blessed with the ability to mentally reconstruct crimes scenes, a kind of mental time travel.<br />The plot of SLWC revolves around the dying Kansas community of Medicine Creek. Reeling from cutbacks at the local turkey slaughterhouse, the town elders are trying to make the community attractive to the likes of Kansas University geneticists, who intend to test a new crop of genetically-altered corn in either Medicine Creek or the nearby town of Deeper.<br />Then a wave of murders and mutilations hit. First, a young woman searching for Indian relics is found murdered and posed with 40 or so dead crows in a nearby corn field. Soon, a dog and a famous scientist are also found in a similar fashion. Is this the work of a serial killer inspired by a local legend (&quot;The Curse of the '45's&quot;) involving the massacre of militant white folk by angry Cheyenne Indians? Or is this a ploy to affect the decision being made about the crops of genetically altered corn?<br />In the middle of all this is Wonder Agent Pendergast and his 18-year-old assistant, Corrie.<br />I'm sorry, but this Pendergast character is simply laughable. He's a latter-day Sherlock Holmes, mildly flustered by all the activity at first, but is eventually the first individual with a firm grasp on all the facts. His smugness gets tiresome real darned quick.<br />Every cliched red-herring is on display here. The principled reporter on the heels of the story of his career. The local sheriff who wants the FBI off the case. The disaffected goth teenager who is actually smarter than anyone else around her. Not to mention the overly Luddite tone of the book itself, taking absurd stands on the topic of gene-altered crops and the like.<br />I generally enjoy the books of Childs and Preston, especially &quot;The Ice Limit&quot; and &quot;Mount Dragon&quot;. This one, however, I'd recommend avoiding. Its simply too absurd and laughable for its own good.nager who is actually smarter than anyone else around her.

It pains me to say it, having followed Roland's quest for the Dark Tower since 1988, but....Wizard and Glass is WAY too long for its own good.<br />DT:W&G opens up with Roland and his entourage riding along with Blaine the Suicidal Monorail, partaking in the telling of riddles in exchange for their lives. They manage to outwit Blaine just before reaching a bitter and messy end, arriving at their destination of Topeka, Kansas, in our world. Or rather, in the world of \\"Captain Trips\\".<br />After rummaging around the city, Roland tells his followers a long and drawn-out tale of love, death, crystal balls (the titular \\"glass\\"), and blowing up stuff to look tough.<br />I've always felt that King never gave us enough backstory on Roland. He would constantly refer back to his friends, Alain, Cuthbert, etc..., and with a very brief exception (during Roland's \\"coming of age\\" battle with Cort), you never got to meet them. Ergo, you never felt Roland's regret at having lost his closest friends. But here, in DT:W&G, you get ALOT of them. 547 pages of them, to be precise. You also get a rather heavy love story, as well. Lots of heavy petting and outdoor sex. By the end of it, I was glad that all of Roland's buddies were dead. For 547 pages, I felt King fumbling the ball. This portion of the book could easily have been trimmed by about 200 pages. Yes, you get alot of information on how Mid-World relates to our world, how the breaking of the Beams is causing the many alternate dimensions to melt together. Too much wordage, not enough plot.<br />Once the big flashback is over, its back with to the ka-tet and everything is peachy again.<br />I love this series, but I hope to heck and back that King manages to avoid more \\"backstory\\" like this.	2003-06-27

I'm not much of a fan of this genre - the prison/revenge thriller, Ex-Con needs to go out and make good, etc... Nonetheless, this book floored me. Its not very often than a writer speaks TRUTH about the human condition. Early on in the book, the author discusses Shel's co-dependant relationship with a petty, mental-defective criminal named Frank. The paragraph talking about the role of a \\"Good Samaritan\\" details some of the truth I'm talking about. Its not only true, but beautifully written.<br />Yeah, the book is a crime thriller but it manages to sidestep almost every cliche of the genre. Despite their foibles and criminal tendancies, you care about these people, and fiercely at that.	2003-06-16
US	41986150	R2U0MIRSRQU02M	1587152010	514109495	The Nightmare People	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Entertaining but dumb	The Nightmare People opens with a bang, quite possibly the 2nd best opening chapter I've ever read (Blood Music by Connelly being the first).<br />Ed Smith spies a particularly hideous monster peering in his window one hot August evening. He halks it up to a waking dream or hallucination, only to find out the next morning that all 200 occupants of his apartment complex have gone missing. Those neighbors are eventually found, but have apparently been replaced by...otherworldly creatures wearing their skins.<br />The plot is downright implausible and silly. The author throws in some rather idiotic complications to delay Smith and his band of \\"nightmare people killers\\" from going to the police. It seems fairly obvious that Watt-Evans wrote himself into a corner here.<br />There are some very audacious set-pieces in this book, some that make you shiver to your very bones. The creatures in this novel aren't circumspect about their purpose - call one of the telephone (yes, they'll answer) and it'll be more than happy to tell you about its (evil) purpose in this world.<br />Characterization, beyond the main character, is lacking but to be expected of a 200 page book. The action is fast, lose, and while nonsensical, ends up being satisfying. I found the final resolution to be a tad pat, almost \\"deus ex machina\\"-like, but I'm still glad I read it.<br />Given a few changes, such as the creatures' main weakness, this would make a very scary horror movie.	2003-06-16

The only character we have to latch onto is a complete sadist whose entire life is filled with committing acts of rape, murder in the name of....who knows what. Joshua Al Quarre is in it for no one but himself.<br />Lets face it. Barnes was having a bad couple of months while writing this book, but his genius shines through. Despite lacking in sympathetic major characters, Barnes blows through...well...a century of a very grim and plausible alternate future. Once the Memes show up (programs that are capable of re-writing the human mind), you are already blown away by this stunning and wildly inventive book.<br />\\"Kaleidoscope Century\\" is very short. I finished it in about four hours. But its a ride I tell you. If you can forgive heavily misanthropic themes and just enjoy the story, I guarantee you'll have a good time.	2003-06-16

Arlian comes back from Desolation after participating in the events leading to the demise of Lords Enziet and Drisheen, pondering ways to fulfill his vow of ridding the world of the dragon plague. Immediately we are thrust back into the political machinations of the upper-crusty society of Manfort. Too much time is spent with Arlian thinking \\"but oh...the dragons...they are evil and must be stopped!\\". 90% of the novel takes place within the confines of Manfort, where the previous book gave us a more complete picture of Arlian's world.<br />That said, I got a real feel for the characters, Black and Toribor in particular. Arlian is a tad one-dimensional in his quest. He is MUCH too misunderstood, too martyr-like in his quest to be interesting. Thankfully, the other characters in the novel are significant enough to shoulder the weight of the narrative.<br />As another poster mention, this definately feels like \\"the middle book\\". While there is a definate ending to the book, its not particularly satisfying. The dragons are fleshed out a bit further as a major threat, but we don't see much of them. When one finally does make an appearance, it doesn't feel like the revelation it should be.<br />But I have faith in Watt-Evans. His \\"Book of Silence\\" series with Garth the Overman is my favorite fantasy series of all time and I have high hopes for his latest. I'm sure whatever he comes up with next, it will have made The Dragon Society a worthwhile read.	2003-05-30

Like many people in my generation (born from 1970-1977), I grew up just as computer games were hitting the mainstream. I remember the release of the first Ultima game. I remember my first years in college as playing &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; became a worthwhile replacement for studying. I remember begging my parents to allow me to use their credit card just so I could order the retail version of &quot;Doom&quot;. Playing in my first &quot;Doom&quot; LAN. Playing my first &quot;Quake&quot; deathmatch online.<br />If any of this sounds familiar to you and stirs up fond memories, this is a book you should definately purchase.<br />Anyone who has followed game development over the past decade will recognize the names of the principles - John Carmack, John Romero, Tom Hall, Adrian Carmark, Kevin Cloud, ID Software, Apogee, etc... David Kushner has created a literary time machine with his work, exhaustively researched (though factually inaccurate in several places), briskly paced, and extremely informative.<br />Sadly, the aforementioned &quot;brisk pace&quot; almost undermines the book. Kushner spends very little time on the childhoods of Romero and Carmark - about 20 pages each, just enough to indicate how difficult their childhoods were, how misunderstood and deprived they felt. Kushner rips through their early years, their maligned stint at Softdisk crunching out shareware, recruiting programmers and forming ID Software in Texas, Romero's hyped departure and the creation of ION Storm. Its all here, but often feels glossed over. I felt the need to know more about the principles. Any regret for the sacrifices they made for their success? To get inside their skulls, what are they really thinking?<br />Fact is, the book is probably a work of genius, considering its potentional audience.  Its written by a guy with a short attention span for people with short attention spans. I enjoyed the heck out of it, but it left me with more questions than answers. Nuff saidttention spans.

There's something about the man, dark or mysterious, keeping him on the edge and away from the closeness that brings comfort from others. He is the perennial loner. After reading eight books about Bosch the Cop, we are now gifted with a story about Heironymous the pensioner. Bosch's instincts, however, haven't changed much<br />I won't give away the story, much. Bosch, never one to let anything slide, becomes obsessed with the 4-year-old murder of a Hollywood production assistant. Bosch's involvement with the investigation of this murder came to an end after a daring heist rips off 2 million dollars from the set of movie. The money had been a prop. Bosch had been there interviewing the director. A tenuous link is drawn between the theft of the money, which resulted in the death of a bank officer and the injury of another, and the murder of the production assistant. But the case is handed to another division. Bosch is still haunted by the unsolved case, four years later. Despite lacking a badge, Bosch decides to whip out his old murder book and go on the hunt. Along the way, we meet some familiar characters, open up a few new cans of worms, close a few old ones, and discover the darkside of \\"Homeland Security\\".<br />As always, Bosch's life is a slow-motion trainwreck. He has a head for criminal investigations, but spares little by way of thought for his own heart. As he is haunted by the murder case and the specter of his ex-wife, you can't help but feel attached to our old boy-in-blue. He is singularly tragic and always compelling.  Hoping his life will turn out for the best is part of what keeps me reading. \\"Lost Light\\" did not disappoint.<br />That said, \\"Lost Light\\" is more of a novel for Bosch fans. Too many old plot points are picked up here that might leave the casual reader lost. I'm not in any way discouraging the purchase of this book. I finished it while still sitting in the bookstore parking lot, four hours after buying it. Just be prepared to love the character and buy the previous eight Bosch books. You will not regret it.ed it while still sitting in the bookstore parking lot, four hours after buying it. Just be prepared to love the character and buy the previous eight Bosch books.

While it isn't phenomenal or groundbreaking as some of Gibson's other works are, it does cast our world in a different light. Particularly our society's fascination with designer labels and 'Net subculture.<br />The book is a moody piece of work. Hip but not daring. Slow but always fascinating. I'm not going to rundown the plot, as others have already done so. I will say something about the ending, which is a bit of a letdown. Your mind has a million, more satisfying ideas about where the plot could have led. Instead, it ends up being rather pedestrian and the book suffers for it, particularly since its something of a detective story. Everything about the book is leading towards it and then it just...ends. Blah.	2003-02-17

The character remains untouched by the plot.<br />That is certainly NOT the case here.<br />Other reviewers have discussed the plot at length, so I'm not going to beat a dead horse. Simply put, the plot is a mindbender, and definately NOT a cliche.<br />Instead, I want to stress the **emotional** reaction I had to this book. The characters inhabiting this novel live and breath. They have real foibles, they make real decisions. Their lives lived under the shadow of Kuin, the shadow of the Chronoliths is a constant, daily struggle to avoid fate. Imagine a world where everyone feels their fate is already mapped out for them, where you &quot;know&quot; your life will no longer be your own in a very short period of time. The depression these characters feel...it all felt extremely real to me.<br />I found myself crying more than once reading this book.	2003-01-03

Well, that's kind of the point. The novel is heavily focused on the failures of its characters. Yes, given the backdrop of all this cosmic wonderment - alien species, the end of the universe, black holes - they are still **human** and still very much looking out for number one. This is the major character flaw of the human race, the inability to act selflessly to further the species, something the alien \\"conquerors\\" appear to have done rather well in their quest to \\"engulf\\" the universe. The ending of the book has some major religious implications, and will possibly confuse anyone not already familiar with Tipler's Omega Point theory. But the entire book can be summed up by this one line, spoken between two characters near the end - \\"Everything matters, Mr. Wolf. That's why excuses always fail\\". Yes, the book could have been better, but Barton and Capobianco have always been obsessed with the negative dynamic between any group of characters, the interplay between wants and needs. In reality each and every character in their books, ALL of their books, are looking for redemption and reconciliation. In this book, their characters finally find it.	2003-01-03

First with his &quot;Uplift&quot; series, then with the novel &quot;Earth&quot; (and man, what a book that was). I started to wonder about him when he wrote some Star Trek comic book fiction and a series of books for kids about time travel. But it looks like he was cooking up something good in the interim. &quot;Kiln People&quot; (in my humble opinion) is by far his best.<br />To me, Brin is always best when he remains grounded. Like someone said about his novel &quot;Earth&quot;, extrapolating 1000 years into the future is easy. You have no reference point and who knows what scientific breakthroughs will take place over the next millenium. Extrapolating 50 to 100 or so years into the future, a future you may conceivably live in....that's hard to do. Hard to make fantastic and believable at the same time. He succeeded admirably in &quot;Earth&quot;.<br />&quot;Kiln People&quot; takes place a couple of centuries from now. Society is a vastly different place, but the people in it are very familiar. The major difference? A technology which allows the user to create short-lived duplicates of oneself. These duplicates, called &quot;dittos&quot;, made of clay, with a one-day life span, are infused with the personality and memories of it's archetype. The duplicates are assigned a variety of tasks, depending on it's original. Going to work for the day. Fighting prearranged wars that decide national issues. Sleuthing for missing persons.<br />And once the ditto has reached the end of it's useful lifespan, it's memories can be reinfused with the original user.<br />The main character, Albert, becomes embroiled with a case involving a possible advance in Kiln technology, something that could completely change the way Dittos are made, and their prospective longevity.<br />Giving away any more would do you a possible disservice.<br />I was struck by the ease with which Brin switched perspectives from one Ditto to the other, all originally from the same user. How their thoughts after initially waking into this world were all the same, and how they grew into their own personalities by the end of their life span. Each time a ditto expired...well, you're a little saddened by it, and a bit surprised by how haphazardly they are treated by both their users and by other &quot;real people&quot;.<br />That thought is the major &quot;meat&quot; of this novel.<br />Anyway, I enjoyed &quot;Kiln People&quot;.

If you are looking for Melville or Fitzgerald, ya might wanna try English Lit 101 again.<br />Everything here is in service of the plot - a manmade nanite has destroyed the underpinnings of human civilization and is threatening to destroy what is left of it.<br />There's alot of suspense here, terror of the unknown, discovery on a landmark journey, treachery, chases, and above all else, a warning on just how far we've come a little too quickly.<br />This one will stay on my shelf for good. McCarthy is a credit to the genre, and while I wasn't too thrilled with his latest book &quot;Collapsium&quot;, I'm hoping that he'll next revisit the universe he created in &quot;Bloom&quot; and take it to the next step, kick it up a notch or two, and let it soar.	2001-12-17

Young, impressionable, looking at a career in science, and very much a fan of science fiction. This, I guess you could say, was my first foray into Hard-SF, and what a \\"first foray\\" it was, too.<br />I was amazed by the novel, but to say the least, nonplussed to learn I had to read yet ANOTHER book to even get into the real story just hinted at \\"Hyperion\\" (actually, there are four books here, not just two). I waited patiently for \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" to be released. Again, I was blown away. The characters, the plot, the shear strength of the author's imagination. So, at the tender age of 17, I had the book by which to judge all other books - Sci-Fi or otherwise.<br />There are so many things RIGHT about this novel. Simmons' compassion for his characters, be they minor plebes or major contributors to the plot. He fleshes out these characters to the point where they jump off the page, live lives of their own.<br />The plot? Convoluted, complex, and simply unlike any other HardSF novel I've read since, which is to say \\"stupendous\\".<br />And the authors style itself, while not an easy read, is comfortable, literate, and definitely his own. Simmons' is a voice that I've yet to see topped by any other SF novelist, and that includes the greats like Silverberg, Asimov, Delany, and Clarke.<br />If you've read the other reviews, you'll hear that \\"Hyperion\\" is sort of a Bocaccio's \\"The Decameron\\" set in space, or perhaps just another space opera. Yeah, \\"Hyperion\\" is both of those things, but so much more.<br />The first novel in this series aims to do one thing, and one thing only - to lay the foundation for the next three books in the series. \\"Hyperion\\" introduces us to the place - humanity's domain spanning a web of hundreds of worlds, linked together by a technology that allows humans to move from world to world instantaneously. And the conflict - an offshoot of humanity, the evolved \\"Ousters\\", coming back from their journey into the far reaches of space, apparently to begin a war with us world-bound humans. Then there's the \\"technocore\\", the domain of the A.I.s, long seceded from Man's rule, and pursuing their own nefarious ends. The characters - six men and one woman, on a pilgrimage to the world of Hyperion, and planet so strange, wonderful, and complex, that even the Technocore knows not what to make of it. Their quest - while a potentially empire-crushing war with the Ousters rages above the planet, these pilgrims are to visit the enigmatic Shrike, a vengeful beast so steeped in mythology and lore as to be a god of all its own, to find out what humanity's place in the universe really is.<br />I cannot recommend this book more highly, and I've read plenty of them. The only drawback? \\"Hyperion\\" is simply the first step in the journey. But if you are patient, and find it within yourself to read all four books in this series, you will be rewarded. If you often empathize with characters you read about, you will find yourself crying.

It had the potential to be quite scary, entertaining. And while a &quot;journey to the center of the earth&quot; is not an idea that is fresh or original by any means, the plot is de-Verne-inized by giving it a complete Y2k spin. 21st century science, 21st century military.<br />But this books fails, in my opinion, on the weight of it's narrative. Jeff Long is a very good writer. He can string verbs and nouns together and taken sentence by sentence, it SOUNDS great. But, you know what? This is an adventure novel, pure and simple, and not the retelling of Dante's Inferno. The book WANTS to be much more serious than it is. It wants to be a social commentary (ie - shadowy corporations look to exploit and ultimately control the underworld), controversially anti-religious and scandalous (ie - one character used specious science and conjecture to prove the Shroud of Turin is a fake, also Satan lives and walks among us!!)....<br />Other complaints? I didn't buy the science (some real lapses in this novel, including one wacky &quot;time travel&quot; subplot that the author never bothers to explain), nor the military's reaction to the existance of the underworld. Characters run around making dumb decisions......<br />After awhile, it gets tiresome.<br />The author reached for the stars on this one, and then fell flat on his face. It would have been nicer if he'd been content to tell a plain-old rousing adventure novel. He certainly had all the ingrediants.	2001-12-02

This is one of those books.<br />First things first, though. The plot is definately NOT compelling. Jack comes to America and meets his half-sister and wants to sleep with her, then goes to Rome with said sister, looking for some girl, all the while wringing his hands about how to publish this &quot;manual of light&quot;. So they find this girl and Jack likes her, too, and....<br />See what I mean? The plot is not the book's strong point.<br />I kept reading Indigo because the characters were strong, well-fleshed out, and felt like they were alive. Each character has their story, their own quirks, something that makes then interesting and special, and they had them in spades.<br />I plan to keep this book on my shelf for some time, perhaps adding some of Joyce's other novels as well.	2001-12-02
US	41986150	RYAX44Y1JRQM	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	4	8	13	N	N	Impressed....but....	Why would Straub want to have anything to do with King's &quot;DT&quot; universe? I'm a little stunned at that.<br />Oh...the book....<br />...is very good. Style is much changed between &quot;Talisman&quot; and &quot;Black House&quot;. First 80 pages or so of the book is narrated like a screen play, introducing you to the characters, places, events very much like a DePalma tracking shot. Flitting around on wings of a bird from place to place until we get to Jack Sawyer, the protagonist of the previous novel. Jack himself has changed a bit since we last saw him...<br />For &quot;DT&quot; fans, this book is a treasure trove of Crimson King / Dark Tower references (hey, was Jack taking the Talisman from the Black Hotel the event that caused the destablization of the Dark Tower to begin with? hmmm....). For the uninitiated, it can be a bit tiring to hear about &quot;the path of the beam&quot;, aballah's &quot;Breakers&quot;, and other Dark Tower references without having context. It's almost as if most of the plot is invisible to you.<br />Don't get me wrong - even without knowing a thing about the Dark Tower series and the 14-15 books that fall into the Dark Tower universe, you'll still have a heck of a time reading this novel. I'm just a little sketical at the pervasiveness of King's persistant universe, taking over pretty much all of his fiction...<br />...and now Straub's too?<br />=)	2001-09-17
