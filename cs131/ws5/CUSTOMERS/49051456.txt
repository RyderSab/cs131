US	49051456	RPOZUARR8QV15	0060587245	788287682	The Breakdown Lane	Books	5	7	10	N	Y	EXCELLENT!!!!!!	This book blew me away!  I like the author already but I purchased the book because of the subject matter. Like the character, Julieanne, I also have MS and was diagnosed at age 43.<br /><br />The story is so poignant and I could feel the characters just jump off the page.<br /><br />It is a story of one woman's battle with the sudden desertion of her husband of whom she has been with since she was a very young woman.  Then finding herself with three children to take care of herself and being diagnosed with MS.<br /><br />She has to fight this monster of a deisease plus the feeling of abandonment.  It is told from her point of view and her son, Gabe, who is 14 at the time and educationally challenged.<br /><br />I could go on and on.....but just read it.  You don't have to have a chronic illness or even a crummy ex husband to appreciate this author and her style of writing.<br /><br /> This story is told with truth and humor and tugs at the heartstrings as well.  Read It, It's fantastic!	2005-05-20

She can write about real life family situations with such a reality you feel the characters.<br /><br />This about a child who is \\"kidnapped\\" by her father and does not know about it until 28 years later when he is arrested for the crime.<br /><br />It delves into her life now, before and after.  There are so many lies and situations that are hard to comprehend.<br /><br />Ms Picoult writes from everybodys perspective.  The daughter, father, mother, lawyer, boyfriend,lover, grandchild. They all play a part and have their story.  You learn about the courtroom procedure and how one survives prison and many other unbelievable and real situations.<br /><br />Once again, I loved a Jodi Picoult book.  I only wish there had been a little less written about the Indian lady Delia meets in Arizona.  5 stars for the rest!!!!!	2005-04-03

I read most of Joyce Carol Oates books and this by far is the best I have read.<br /><br />It is the story of a family and the turbulent 50, 60, and 70's.  It is also the story of love and redemption, parenthood, political issues and so on.  It is complex and it studies each character quite well.<br /><br />It took me only 3 days to read and it is a very long novel.  Please read it.  This is one excellent author.<br /><br />The story ended and I felt a satisfaction with it how it did.  Good Work, Ms Oates.  Will make an outstanding movie.	2004-10-29

My husband and I were visiting Mackinaw City and I bought this book while we were there.  I read the whole thing on our drive home.  It takes us 3 hours to get home.<br /><br />First of all, I love time travel themed books anyway.  This book could be compared to \\"Somewhere in Time\\", yet I believe it to be even better.<br /><br />It is the story of a young man in 1975 who travels to Mackinac Island and falls in love with the timelessness of the enviornment and also fall in love with a woman in a picture taken in 1905.  The picture hangs in the hotel he stays at.<br /><br />So as not to spoil the book, I will just say, that of course he travels back in time, they are together and it has a very touching and lovely ending.  This story depicts the island so beautifully and also adds mystery and the theme of a most enduring love.<br /><br />I have to recommend this to anyone who loves love stories and anyone at all familiar with Mackinac Island.  I understand this is going to be a movie.<br /><br />It is such a beautiful, funny, touching and wonderful story to read.  I am going to share it with everyone I know.	2004-09-12

A familiar plot, as far as two middle age people finding and trying to recapture their first passionate love.<br /><br />The thing that made this story stand apart from others was that it was told in such a truthful and credible way.  I could actually picture myself as Amy and her feelings for Nick.<br /><br />The very best thing about this book is that is has a very satifsfying ending, perfect and real!!  You will care about these people and not want this novel to end.<br /><br />I am anxious to see what this author writes next.	2004-08-05

I was really surprised because Nicholas Sparks writes such good love stores.<br />I must tell you though by reading this book you begin to understand the man behind the author and where he gets his ideas and talent.<br />It is humorous and sad reading about the Sparks family.  For such a young man he has endured a lot and come out quite well.  I highly reccommend this book if you like the author at all.	2004-07-06

This a story so compelling, about the love between family and the dynamics involved.<br />I have read everything this author has written.  I loved Perfect Match and My Sisters Keeper is in that same realm of reading.<br />Ms. Picoult can bring you right into the soul and heart of how an individual feels,you are drawn to these characters.

I bought it because it was a Today Show Pick.  Well let me tell you it was great!!!<br />It is a very suspensful novel about a serial murder who kills during tornadoes.  I couldn't put it down.  Should make a good movie.<br />Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt there were a few loose ends but I would read another by this author.	2004-04-03

I believe this is just as good if not better.<br /><br />It takes place in 1963 Canada.  It is about an Air Force Family and what takes place at the base they are presently stationed at, Centralia in Ontario near the US border.  The father, Jack, is quite a likable all around guy who gets in over his head on a secret mission that just about destroys him.  The wife, Mimi, a French-Canadian is perhaps my favorite character.  She is such a typical 60's mom.<br /><br />Actually all the characters depict the early 60's right down to the smallest detail.  The story is mostly told from the 9 year old, Madelines, point of view.  It involves child abuse and murder and espionage and it all intertwines to make for quite an exciting and enjoyable read.<br /><br />Ms. Mac-Donald captures the times so well it takes me back.. I was a child from the 60's and appreciate her well defined descriptions of life as it really was then, right down to when the young girls sign each others autograph book at the end of the school year......boy, can I remember that!!!!<br /><br />This is not only about going down memory lane.  It is a good mystery and character study of real everyday people and circumstances that can so truly happen in anyones life.<br /><br />I appreciate Ms. Mac-Donalds writing and look forward to her next novel.	2003-12-15

After reading Mystic River, I didn't think this author could match such a good book.  This one beats it!!!<br />It is about an island where they put the criminally insane,called Shutter Island.  Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal, there with another Marshal, Chuck.  He is trying to uncover what He thinks are unorthodox methods of treatment going on in this institute.<br />When you finish this novel, you will find yourself going back and re-reading passages.

Joy Fielding has a way of writing mysteries that keep you reading and reading.<br />This particular story is about Cindy, a fortyish divorcee who is struggling with a relationship with her oldest daughter.  One day Julia {the daughter} goes missing and what transpires is so gut wrenching you can almost feel for the characters<br />It also explores what we really know about each other and in a time of crisis what really counts and who really cares.  For any parent struggling with a relationship with an adult child this book really hits the spot in a lot of areas.<br />My hats off to Joy Fielding for another fine novel.	2003-09-01

Leslie finds a story about a little girl that was kidnapped when she was 5 years old and the more she delves into the story the more similarities she finds in her own vague life.<br />She visits the &quot;Aunt&quot; who raised her and gets some answers somewhat and ends up going to meet this family that she believes may be hers.  She is now 30 years old with a life in Florida but travels to Conneticut to get answers and hopefully find out if this could be her family or if she just wants it so badly has imagined it so.<br />This is a haunting story of lies and maistakes made by every day people and discovering what love and family really represents.<br />Loved this book!	2003-07-27

It takes place in Georgia and involves racism, murder, homosexuality, poor people, rich people, single mothers.......  Once you start reading you won't want to put it down until the final surprise ending.<br />In spite of the fact these three ladies are involved in something as horrible as murder, you like them.  There is also the young Laurel, 20 something, tough and hurt badly by her alcholic mother, who begins to realize these three old ladies have information that will set her free from her past.<br />Get it, read it, you won't regret it.	2003-06-14

I have liked most of Jude Deveraux's books, from \\"a Knight in Shining Armor\\" to \\"The Mulberry Tree\\"  This was quite different in as much the romance wasn't quite as juicy yet subtlely there nevertheless.<br />It is a story about one man's losses and another woman's losses and how they meet on a mission to find out about a murder mystery involving the \\"DEVIL\\".  It kept me interested and I really enjoyed reading it.  It was different for this author.  If you are expecting a hot love story like many of her books can be you won't get it.  You will, though, get a lovely read about two people who come together who need each other and it is a interesting concept.  The devil part and all.  I recommend it to anyone who likes this author.	2003-05-09

I would have given this 5 stars but I found it a little slow getting into.  I loved the part of the story that takes place in 1932 and follows Cissy (Lia's} life.<br />It is a marvelous story based on fact in the state of Vermont and the sterilazation laws that were passed.  It is also the story of lost love and second chances.  It is also a &quot;ghost&quot; story of sorts.  I loved reading it and was sorry to see it end.  This one will make you think and maybe even give you interest in your own history.	2003-04-11

The story is told by her youngest daughter.<br />It is hurmorous yet heartbreaking all at the same time.  This woman is a true survivor of her time and her situation.

I started this book slowly, but at about midpoint in the novel I couldn't put it down.<br />It is a story about one teenage girl and her family in 1965 California. The author captures the time excellently. It is also the story of a family and the trials and tribulations every family faces. I was quite surprised at some of the plot twists.<br />I really liked this book and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact I would have liked a more in depth character development of all the key players. It was an excellent read though and I would read another by Ann Darby.	2002-12-22

If it wasn't for reading the reviews from other Amazon readers I would have never thought to buy this book.  I am very glad I did and have now ordered another Thomas H. Cook novel to read.<br />This story was so haunting.  I couldn't put it down and once it ended I found myself going back to read passages, trying to understand what had happened.  It is a real shocker, grabs you and you won't soon forget the characters.<br />It is about young love in the south in the 60's.  It is also about a tragic event that happened and how it effected this small community for 30 years. Read this book!!!  You won't be disappointed.	2002-11-27

I have always loved Nicholas Sparks and was recommended this because the writing is supposed to be similar.  If you like Mr. Sparks, you will love Mr. Evans as well!<br />It is a story of a young American woman who marries an Italian man, moves to Italy, has his child and lives a very lonely life in a loveless marriage.  She meets an American man and they become fast friends and soon fall in love.<br />The story is wonderful and you will find when you finish the book you wish it was not over.  I fell in love with the characters.  Well at least the main characters, Eliana and Ross.  Eliana's husband left a little to be desired.<br />Mr. Evans is a superb story teller and I will definetly read more of his books.  Marvelous!!!!!	2002-11-22

It is the story of Ella Brady and the married man that she has the misfortune of falling in love with.<br />As is customary for Ms.Binchy, we learn about many people and their lives.  She brings characters from her other novels into the story as well.  Even if you have never read one of her books this is still a super book to read.  It is about family, betrayal, love found, love lost and it all is centered around the lovely restaurant Quentins in Dublin, Ireland.<br />Lovely writing!!!	2002-11-04

Nicholas Sparks can really write a love story.  Have your tissues ready and be ready to cry.  This is my new favorite of his, after The Notebook and Message in a Bottle.<br />It is about the brief love affair of two middle aged people. They meet at time in both of their lives when they really need someone to make a difference in their lives and they do in such a big way, oh boy!!<br />Of course it wouldn't be a Nicholas Sparks book if there wasn't heartbreak and sadness in it and there is.  I highly recommend this to anybody who loves a good love story and I know I am a ... for one.  I intend to give this to my daughters to read, knowing they will love it as well.	2002-09-22

The parents [60's hippy types] are not a major player in the novel but provide an important insight into the background of Aaron, Jack and Lila and how they were raised.<br />When the boys were just teenagers and their sister only 9 years old a terrible tragedy happened to the family that threw them all into a tailspin.  Lila, ten years later goes in search for her one missing brother and tries to piece together what happened.  She witnessed in part the happening, but was so young and it has definitely distorted her life and how she lives it.  She is in some ways mentally effected by the whole thing and has a very strange behavior pattern that at times was disturbing to read.<br />I'm glad I did cintinue reading though because it was worth it.  This author deals with a very terrible tragedy with such depth and drama.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-09-06

It is about Bess Stallone, a tough Long Island girl who just happens to be a gifted pianoist.  She talks with a foul mouth, has a very good sense of humor, you can't help but like her.<br />David is a virtuoso known throughout the world.  He is handsome and very famous, in need of a new partner at the piano.  The long and short of the story is that he picks Bess and works with her as they become a pair on stage and off.  She is so much in love with him and he her.<br />It is a story told before of course, girl from the wrong side of the tracks hooks up with the pretty boy.  Same old story but this one really will grab you and touch you and also make you laugh.  David is a tortured soul who ultimately caves in and falls apart as does their relationship. There are such tender moments though in this story.<br />Of course there is also Jake, her forever friend and the one who has always loved her since 7th grade and will be there for her at the end when she needs him.<br />I loved it.

This was back in the 1950's when life was different, people saw things differently.

I absolutely did not like the main character and narrator of the book, Carrie.  She was so self absorbed and cold, cold, cold.<br />Carrie is already feeling she wants out of her life long relationship with her boyfriend, Mike, when the accident happens that makes him a quadrapalegic.  The long and the short of it is that she bails, totally.  She just up and moves away from her entire family and friends without telling them anything.  She goes to New York where she proceeds into aa relationship with a much older man with his own skeletens \\"in his closet\\"  They have a very sexual relationship.<br />It troubles me that she is able to so easily turn her back on somebody she has loved her entire life. It is also irritating to me that she gets 2 men to love her and she treats them both so shabbily basically.  Alway saying \\"I'm sorry\\" like that makes everything OK.<br />In spite of the fact that Carrie is not a likable character to me, many of the other characters are likable and made the book worth finishing for me.<br />The writing is very good and it really deals with some real life issues.  I personally just can't imagine not standing by my man no matter what.	2002-07-06

It is a look into how the other half lives that's for sure.  Nanny is basically raising the 4 year old child of two self absorbed, arrogant, ridiculously hands off parents.<br />It was so funny yet sad to know that people like this really exist and too many children are harmed in this evironment just as easily as a child without any adavantages can be harmed.<br />I hated to see it end and would really like to know what happens to the family and Nanny.	2002-07-04

It wasn't until near the end that I started crying and it hasn't been many books I can recall that made me cry.<br />The writing is great, the subject matter is difficult to deal with yet it is dealt with in a way that is heart wrenching.  It deals with the death of Suzie Salmon at 14 years old.  A violent death that leaves her family and friends shattered.  Suzie looks on from \\"her heaven\\" to watch them all keep living on earth and how her death changes the events that can happen to the living.<br />She also looks down and follows her killer, a serial killer and very evil soul.  To tell too much would to spoil this book for others.<br />I suggest it but be prepared to be sad and cry although there is a healing power in it, I promise.	2002-06-27

Jude Deveraux writes the most amazing time travel romances ever.  I didn't want this book to end.<br />That Dougless gets her Knight in Shining Armor is so wondeful.  After all, isn't that what all women want. This is not a sappy, cheesy love story.  It is beautifully written and touches your heart.<br />As another reviewer said, I wish Jude Deveraux would write another novel on Dougless and Nicholas.<br />Don't miss reading this.  It is a dream.  I loved it!	2002-06-16

It dealt with a lot of issues and a lot activity I must say.<br />A woman finds out that her soon to be ex-husband has died and it may be a suicide.  She goes on to deal with her guilt, boyfriend past and present, step kids, ex-wife and various other people all in a matter of a few days.<br />It is very interesting reading and sad also to see what can happen to a persons life when dealing with death, love and so on.<br />I liked it.  It was a good fast read, sad, yet humorous too!	2002-05-27

I really like Kate Atkinsons writing style.<br />This is a story of much  complexity and I couldn't put it down.  The story is about a 16 year old girl, Isobel Fairfax and her story is sad, humorous, disturbing and compelling.  I was transfixed with genius of the writing.  You are taken through the past and present and are never sure what is real and what is not but before the book ends you quickly drawn to the reality of it all.<br />Finding the truth of what happened to Eliza, Isobels mother, is especially interesting.  This book also goes into the world of all the people involved with Isobel.  A lot going on here.<br />It is in much the same style as Fall on Your Knees, by Ann-Marie Macdonald.<br />Didn't give it 5 stars because I could have probably done without the Shakespeare part, but it was really a gread read!!!	2002-05-25

Actually, if it had not been for the great reviews,I probably would not have kept reading the book.  I'm very glad I did.<br />It is the story of Ruby Lennox, from conception in 1952 through her 40th year.  Through footnotes in the form of chapters she takes you back to the turn of the century and the lives of her maternal family.  Her grat-grandmother, Alice, grandmother, Nell, mother, Bunty and herself.  Then there are all the sisters, cousins, aunts uncles, father and so on.  There is a lot of story here.<br />It is quite rewarding to read and funny, yet as the story moves on it is quite sad and disturbing.  The author has a way of pulling you in to the life of Ruby Lennox.  You won't be disappointed.  Give this book a chance.  It was great!!!!<br />The only complaint I have is that I wish there had been a family tree to refer to at the beginning of the book.  It became confusing keeping track of everyone.	2002-05-14

It made me laugh and it made me cry.<br />It is the story of a young woman who while in a coma, after supposedly trying to kill herself, remembers back on her life and on her one great love and the loss of that love.<br />It also is a story of family and betrayal.  Above all it is a wonderful story of perfect love.  It really will stay with me for awhile.	2002-05-05

It is one of Jodi Picoults's best books yet.<br />It concerns sexual abuse of a 5 year old boy.  The mother, Nina, is a prosecuter by profession and is trying to put away these child molesters all the time.  She knows how difficult this can be.  When her husband and her find out her son is a victim you find out how this can tear a family apart.<br />The book goes into how each parent, Nina the mother and Caleb the father cope.  Plus, you go into the mind of Nicholas, the young boy, and how he is dealing with his world during this time.<br />This is a very taut and suspensful story with a lot of twists and turns.  I found myself admiring and loathing Nina all at the same time yet feeling nothing but deep concern for Caleb and Nicholas.<br />This is a very good book with a great ending!!!!!	2002-04-30
US	49051456	RD61ORSBPAARG	0743418727	194962038	Perfect Match: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Very hard to put down!!	From the very beginning of this book I was hooked!  <br />It is a story about a married couple, Nina and Caleb, whose 5 year old son they discover has been sexually abused.  Nina is a driven no nonsense prosecuter and understands the system and how it works all too well.<br />You see how each parent reacts to what happens and how they deal with it.  I found myself really not liking Nina so much and feeling more for the father, Caleb, and how he was reacting and feeling.  You are also taken into the mind of young Nathaniel and how he is handling his world.<br />It is written so well and the characters are well developed.  I found the ending to be a surprise and quite satisfying.  <br />If you have read Jodi Picoult before, this is one you have to read!!	2002-04-27

I would not put this one in the same class as The Weight of Water or The Last Time They Met, but it really was a good read.<br />It takes place in 1929, 1930 in Fortunes Rocks, where 2 of her other novels took place, Pilots Wife and Fortunes Rocks.  The story basically follows a newly married couple and a few of the other people in their town dealing with the crash of '29 and of course the relationships that Ms. Shreve develops are interesting.<br />It was a fast read for me.  I didn't really get into it until I was about half way through.  If you are an Anita Shreve fan at all you will like this one, not as deep as others of hers but still a very good read.	2002-04-11

I became very involved in the life of Taylor.  She is so unique and likable.  Her life, loves, occupations, education all become a part of you.<br />I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who likes coming of age stories about somewhat different and likable characters, a survivor.<br />Hope Ms Day writes another novel soon!	2002-04-07

I have since read other Isabel Allende books, and love her writing style.  She gets into the heart of a woman and you can't put the book down.<br />This was a very good story with a history to follow.  How the life of a young woman was started and where she went in life.  It took you on a journey through her life with grandparents and a sham of a marriage and her survival through it all.<br />Loved it!	2002-03-12

This author has a way of pulling you into the stories and feeling the feelings of the characters. There is also a lot meaning behind her words.<br />This was truly a fast read.  I really liked the character, Rennie, although at one point in the book I was ready to clobber Paul for her.<br />If you like Margaret Atwood, don't miss reading this one!	2002-03-09

This by far is one of the best.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  I became so absorbed in the story.<br />It is disturbing yet I could feel for each of the characters.  You get to know them.  James, his wife and three daughters and how their lifes are shaped by a couple of incidents and secrets that shatter everybody's life to some degree.<br />It is interesting to see what develops.  I continued to think about this book once I finished it.  I felt I knew this family.<br />I highly recommend this book.

Lily White was the first book I chose.  It really was hard for me to get through this one.  It dealt with way too much specifics on the law and such and not enough on developing the charachters like she did in Almost Paradise.<br />I made myself finish it, but was disappointed.
