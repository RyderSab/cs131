It was uttered by the 38-year old bank clerk, James Augustus Henry Murray in response to a suggestion that he consider becoming the editor of the then floundering Oxford English Dictionary project. Indeed, at the time (March, 1876) all indications were that the unprecedented mammoth work, intended to supercede previous efforts by Samuel Johnson, Charles Richardson, and Noah Webster, would fail.... that it would in fact never reach completion.<br /><br /> But it was completed, and this is the story of the arduous journey of the OED.<br /><br /> Winchester has written a fascinating, well researched book. I enjoyed every moment of reading it. [I suppose I may be biased in that I have had an interest in the OED for a  long while, and still dream of perhaps owning it one day]. When I told friends what I was reading, several of them looked at me like I was crazy. \\"You're reading a book about a dictionary?\\"<br /><br /> But Simon Winchester is passionate about his topic, and really, his reader finds out that there is a lot more to the compilation of \\"the meaning of everything\\" than you could ever imagine. Incredible feats of organization and participation were required. Incredible setbacks were overcome, time after time. Hundreds and hundreds of people were enlisted in a project lasting over seven decades. The result, in 1928, was a mind-numbing 178 miles of typeface within twenty volumes of morocco leather! And in its revisions, the OED remains to this day, indisputably, the world's greatest dictionary of the English language.<br /><br /> James Murray would not live to see the finished product. This honor would fall to the then Editor-in-Chief, Sir William Craigie. However, it was as certain to all of those working through the final stages at that time, as it is to us reading of it today, that were it not for the heroic determination of Murray, the OED as we know it, would most likely never have survived the initial complications of its existence. It would not exist today.<br /><br /> Winchester has told a grand, wonderful story about a process that, in the hands of a lesser writer, could be as boring as cabbage growing.<br /><br />He brings it to life.

Recently I was in the Public Library on a mission that had nothing to do with Children's books.<br /><br />I am.... umm... more than forty years old, let's just say!<br /><br />But as I was leaving I glanced at a table that had this OUTER-SPACE theme going, for kids. And on the table was the Mushroom book. My mind was instantly transported back to my own childhood, when I first read it.<br /><br />So, I picked it up, and signed it out, re-reading it with a third of a century between my first and second impressions.<br /><br />It is STILL an awesome book, I'm not kidding.<br /><br />In the story, David Topman and Chuck Masterson (don't they just sound like astronauts?) are two boys that build (out of random pieces of aluminum sheeting, plasti-glass and old boat parts found in Cap'n Tom's garage) their own spaceship! They do this in response to an ad that David's father saw in the paper, placed there by a Mr. Bass, who is promising \\"an adventure and a chance to do a good deed\\" to the boys who build the best ship.<br /><br /> The mission is to go to Mr. Bass's home planet, Basidium X.<br /><br /> Mr. Bass is (of course) a Mushroom-Person who has somehow drifted to earth, travelling as a spore, many eons ago. He is the only person on earth who can observe Basidium X from its orbital position 50,000 miles from earth (one-fifth as far as the moon) because he has invented the Stroboscopic Polaroid Filter which, when attached to the lens of his telescope enables him to see the otherwise invisible Mushroom Planet.<br /><br /> The boys create their ship, and they present it to Mr. Bass. I just love the sign in front of Mr. Bass's place, when they arrive.... \\"5 Thallo St. ALL SPACE SHIPS WELCOME!\\"<br /><br /> It is not only the best, but apparently the ONLY submission, and so they are immediately thrown into plans to leave earth for Basidium X that very night! At midnight.<br /><br /> The premise is so wonderfully crazy that I love it.<br /><br /> They are to arrive at Basidium X promptly at 2 a.m. (25,000 miles per hour, in case you are keeping track of gas mileage and all).... and while there they are to see if they can discover what the current state of the planet is by retrieving a \\"canning jar\\" of Basidium air.... and then they are to leave promptly at 4 a.m., and to be back home in bed by a little after six! Landing safely on their beach in Monterey California, a few blocks from their actual house.<br /><br /> When the boys tell their parents about this upcoming trip, of course, they are not believed. And so there is no panic. In fact, David's mother sets out the appropriate clothing that he has requested for the journey.<br /><br /> Little do the grownups know that these boys ain't playing games!<br /><br /> They are actually going. And they do. Right on time. David, as commander, has been given a little folded up piece of paper which he keeps in his wallet and periodically checks, to see if they are on course, and stuff like that! (I love it!)<br /><br /> Everything is going to schedule, right to the minute. [NASA could learn a lot from this Mr. Bass guy!]<br /><br /> When the boys get there, they meet two of the Mushroom People (the planet is covered in tree-tall mushroom growth, and the inhabitants look very mushroom-y too)... these natives are called Mebe and Oru, and the boys soon learn that these two are doomed to be beheaded if they cannot find a solution to the current environmental/ecological problems regarding their essential food supply on Basidium X.<br /><br /> The very authoritative King Ta has ordered these executions, and the boys are soon pleading with him to allow them the allotted two hours to solve the mystery. They are taken on a quick tour, given a quick historical de-briefing, and led to The Place of the Hidden Water. Here is where the dying vegetation, essential to the Mushroom People is located.<br /><br /> The boys are initially stumped. They are grossed out at the overall sulfuric smell of the place.<br/><br /> Later, when they are just about to leave, Chuck begins to eat a bit of his lunch, and herein the mystery is solved. I won't say more because I know that all of you want to run out and buy this book today and read it.<br /><br /> Suffice it to say though, that just before they left earth, Mr. Bass reminded them that they needed to bring along a mascot, and (pressed for time) all that David could scrounge up was an old hen in the chicken coop by the name of Mrs. Pennyfeather. So they took along this.... chicken, into outer space.<br /><br /> Mrs. Pennyfeather ends up saving the entire race of Mushroomites, Mebe and Pru are spared, the boys are planetary heroes, King Ta rewards them by giving them his ceremonial necklace, and they return to earth safely, whereupon, the next day they prove to their parents that the whole thing was real.<br /><br /> There are many moments of doubt, whereupon the reader wonders if the boys are dreaming this whole adventure up. (I'm sure I wondered this much less with the first go-around, thirty-some years ago).<br /><br /> But it is really so well-written. So fanciful. I consider it a children's classic.<br /><br /> The fact that it, and the whole Mushroom series is still in print, attests to its classic status.<br /><br /> Originally published in 1954, this book of 195 pages still can speak to a generation of kids, I really think it can. In fact, I hope that it can.<br /><br />Nowadays, the youngest of elementary schoolkids can tell you that even a few inches of unprotected surface-area WILL spell disaster for any spacecraft and crew upon re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.<br /><br /> It was so nice to read Cameron's book and suspend my imagination for a wee bit. To believe that a dang old chicken can save the fate of an invisible planet hovering between here and the moon. To not worry about the logistical problems of a space ship constructed of Cap'n Tom's random odds and ends.

I just finished reading this book and I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel that anyone who truly ponders the intricacies involved in the process of writing, anyone who has grappled with the process itself, will find this book relevant, beneficial, and even entertaining.<br /><br /> Margaret Atwood mingles wit with wisdom. Erudition with transparency.<br /><br /> It is unpretentious from start to finish, which I think is an Atwood hallmark.<br /><br /> As explained in the prologue, the six chapters are really six re-worked lectures, delivered in the year 2000 at Cambridge University. They are intended for \\"specialists in literature, general readers, and - especially - writers at an earlier stage or dewier stage than my own.\\"<br /><br /> They are not sequentially built upon each other, but rather, they circle like gulls over a set of common themes having to do with the writer, the writer's medium, and the writer's art.<br /><br /> The three main questions covered are as follows: \\"Who are you writing for? Why do you do it? Where does it come from?\\"<br /><br /> Who, why, and where... and nowhere how.<br /><br /> This is not a book about how to write.<br /><br /> It is a book about what it is like to write.<br /><br /> What it MEANS, to be a writer.<br /><br /> The most interesting section, in my opinion, was the third, entitled \\"The Great God Pen\\" because it focused on the second question \\"Why does the writer write?\\"... my favorite of the three. Here, Atwood talked about the topic of \\"art for art\\" and it was fascinating. Does the writer write to make money? For hope of fame? To project a moral statement? Create something beautiful? Exonerate oneself? Impress the masses?<br /><br /> Her prodigious and eclectic wealth of reference points and allusions show that she did not begin her thoughts on this topic just last week. In this chapter (and the entire book) we are the recipients of a very-much-still-alive LIFETIME of experiential and theoretical research, of such a caliber it can be considered among the finest scholarship in the field.<br /><br /> And again, witty as all get out.<br /><br />Here is an example of what I mean by that: \\"I can still hear the sneer in the tone of the Parisian intellectual who asked me, `Is it true you write the bestsellers?'<br /><br /> `Not on purpose,' I replied somewhat coyly.\\" (p.68).<br /><br /> Much of the book reads as memoir yes! (as other reviewers have commented). But how can this be a negative thing? If it is the writer's life we are concerned with learning about, is it not wonderful that one of the best in the world will share with us relevant glimpses and pieces of her own?e finest scholarship in the field. <br /> And again, witty as all get out.  <br />Here is an example of what I mean by that: \\"I can still hear the sneer in the tone of the Parisian intellectual who asked me, `Is it true you write the bestsellers?' <br /> `Not on purpose,' I replied somewhat coyly.\\" (p.68). <br /> <br /> Much of the book reads as memoir yes!

I would begin my review by saying that if you are going to begin a journey into the wonderful world of McEwan, don't begin here. Then I would say that he is one of my favorite writers, EVER. He is incredibly good, but I am afraid that none of these eight stories really resonated with me. I would say that they don't represent how well he can write. If you began here, you might assume that McEwan is somewhat fixated with sexual rites of passage themes, when really he isn't.<br /><br />From a pickled penis, in the first story; to childhood incestuous rape, in the second; to a third story (perhaps the best of all) with the least amount of sexual innuendo; to the fourth, depicting uncontrollable on-stage public sexual intercourse; to the fifth, sexually motivated murder; to the sixth, about a masturbatory recluse; to the seventh, the \\"art\\" of which, eluded me almost entirely; to the eighth, involving what I consider child abuse brought on by a self-obsessed, cross-dressing caregiver.<br /><br />Are the stories written well? Hell yes.<br /><br />McEwan is exquisite (present tense) and this book (1975) proves that \\"exquisiteness\\" is not just a recent development with him. It is the subject matter that I find objectionable. And not so much in an \\"immoral\\" sense as much as in an \\"unappealing\\" sense. In these stories he is dealing with such grotesque imagery, that I find it difficult to find these particular stories applicable. For the most part, they are about the kind of stuff that even the newspapers omit from their most disturbing back pages.<br /><br />Maybe I don't want to look that close. Perhaps I don't want to read about how some guy \\"tosses himself off\\" in the closet of some attic somewhere, or how in a shadowy tunnel along a river, a young girl is sexually victimized and then slid into the river, like a fish that no one wanted, because it was too small for a good meal.<br /><br />They are fairly brutal stories, I'm not kidding.<br /><br />But McEwan is SUCH a great writer. If I have caught you in time, read him elsewhere, and then come back here when you are in love with him. And trust him.in time, read him elsewhere, and then come back here when you are in love with him. And trust him.   <br />	2005-07-16

The neat thing about reading Matthew Pearl is that you do not have to be familiar with his style, don't have to be well-versed in what he has written previously. This is Pearl's first book! There is an excitement in that, for me. Like diving into a pool without testing the water first.<br /><br />The author is a graduate of Harvard and Yale Law School and a Dante scholar.<br /><br />The book is about a series of truly horrific and grisly murders that take place in Boston in the 1860's, and specifically, in and around the \\"Boston Brahmin\\" society of the day. In the first one, after being somewhat bludgeoned (but not to death) a judge is eaten alive by maggots. Uh-huh!<br /><br />In the next murder, a minister is buried upside down, and his feet, which are sticking out of the ground, are set aflame.<br /><br />This other guy gets severely (and I mean, quite really severely) sliced up into ribbons and is left hanging like a side of beef in this deserted castle type place.<br /><br />Doesn't this all sound wonderfully beach blankety?<br /><br />Truthfully, there is a lot of gore in the book. No doubt. But the plot of the book turns upon the fact that the authorities are baffled as to any connectible evidence regarding these crimes. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to motive.<br /><br />Little do they know that this wild spate of violence is in fact, motivated by reason and rhyme!<br /><br />The killer has been fashioning his crimes based upon the punishments described in Dante's Divine Comedy (specifically the \\"Inferno\\" section), and at the same time, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow has been engaged in the production of the English translation of Dante. This is where Pearl's novel dovetails with history.<br /><br />At this time in Boston society, there was a Dante Club. It consisted of Longfellow, J.T. Fields, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell, and George Washington Greene. They were literary giants in their own right, who met as friends frequently, and officially met once a week to discuss that portion of the Dante translation that was currently being completed by the leader, the venerable Longfellow.<br /><br />As the murders continue to wreak havoc and mayhem and incite terror in the populace, these scholars become embroiled in the case.<br /><br />All leads lead to Dante! Since Dante's work was virtually unknown in America at the time, this band of bookish litterati emerge as the only hope in deciphering the connections, anticipating the killer's next move, and zeroing in on his/her identity. They alone possess the esoteric wherewithal to link the details of the crime with the epic poem itself.<br /><br />Even though we as readers are on the inside track, the ending is shocking. A surprise.<br /><br />Pearl blends a wealth of historical fact with this debut novel, but the thing is so wonderfully embellished that I would hesitate to call it \\"historical fiction.\\" I would rather call it an intelligent, thrilling, whodunit! It has been compared to Caleb Carr's The Alienist and equated with the scholarly density of Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.<br /><br />It is my pick for a dangity-good summer read!<br /><br />If this book were pasta, it would be al dente!<br /><br />Done just right!

But it won't be the last.<br /><br />It was about artistic obsession. And other things, yes.<br /><br />But mostly the artistic obsession of this reclusive artist, Jeremy Pauling.<br /><br />Jeremy is the proprietor of a boarding house where all types of somewhat eccentric people can be found occupying the rooms. But no one comes close to being as eccentric as Jeremy himself. He can be holed-up in his third-floor studio for days at a time, working on his secret creations. His artwork sort of defies genre. It is part sculpture, part bas-relief sort of glue-together-parts-of-things-found-in-the-room thingamajigs.... but he has a remarkable talent for creating feeling in his work. His work, crazy as it is, seems to breathe, and evoke movement. It attracts buyers, mostly through the promotional efforts of his college friend, an art dealer named Brian.<br /><br />The infrequent selling of his work, the winning of occasional contests, and the meagre rents he collects from his tenants, keep the house running.<br /><br />The epitome of artistic reclusiveness, Jeremy has not been any further than the local corner store for years!<br /><br />But soon, the young single mother Mary Tell moves in, with her daughter Darcy. And this changes Jeremy's life. And it changes Mary's life. The novel is shaped around the effect that each of these people have on the other. As Jeremy will learn in retrospect, Mary has given his life an \\"eyelike\\" shape, rather than the never-ending flatline that it would have most surely been, had he never known her.<br /><br />Celestial Navigation was published in 1974, and as such, it is by no means one of your modern novels. No one here is playing with the internet or looking for better deals at Best Buy! Often it seems quite dated.<br /><br />Me, I like this. I am uncommon in this respect. I sort of like older books.<br /><br />And it is definitely not an ACTION sort of book. It is a book deep in its characterization.

I am not done.<br /><br />AG is the fictionalized story of the real-life Grace Marks, possible murderess, possible innocent. Each possibility is never rendered a final verdict, and this is part of the book's overall appeal (to me). In an online interview, the author stated:<br /><br />It is not a murder mystery, it is a mystery about murder.... In a murder mystery you have to come up with the conclusion, or the readers will rise up against you. You can't just end it by saying, \\"Well, I don't know.\\"<br /><br />In other words, this novel, as the real story itself, does end with an \\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />It is definitely a mystery about murder.<br /><br />The truth about Grace's culpability has never, and will never, be known.<br /><br /> One thing that this novel shows is how incredibly difficult it is to reconstruct the past when using present-day testimony as the sole source for truth. Especially when that testimony has to be fit into an existing grid of presupposition, prejudice, and partiality, and can be slanted in favor of the person offering it. [In this case, Grace's future depends not only on how she conducts herself, but on how she is perceived by those on whom her freedom depends.]<br /><br />In real-life, when she was released, Grace had to fill out a final questionnaire, in which she was asked, \\"What has been the general cause of your misfortunes and what has been the immediate cause of the crime for which you have been sent to the Penitentiary?\\"<br /><br />She answered:<br /><br />\\"Having been employed in the same house with a villain.\\"<br /><br />I close by saying that I choose to believe these words of hers.

I think I might have sinned a little in my envy of the perfection of it.\\" And later on she said, of McEwan \\"He's too popular to be so good.\\" I felt the same and agree with her. McEwan is definitely a writer of successful and successive masterpieces. He keeps getting better and Saturday is the best of the four McEwan books I have read thus far.<br /><br /> It is simply amazing the sheer AMOUNT of things, incidents, that happen to Henry Perowne and his family in this one day, Saturday, February 15, 2003. Amazing, and yet so believably presented. McEwan is the consummate chronicler of incident.<br /><br /> Saturday is a character-driven book. Here we find a leading man who is consistently decent without ever being a namby-pamby moralist. Here is an engaging story that abounds in optimism and resolves itself in decency without ever avoiding the ugliness and potential violence that exists in the real world. These have the capacity to change our lives in an instant. Henry, (by no means a Pollyanna-figure  but rather a scientifically calculated realist when the chips are down) has to face time-and-again in this one Saturday, what it means to \\"do the right thing.\\"<br /><br />The Perownes are perhaps the most lovable (lovely) family I have met in literature.<br /><br />With Saturday, I predict a second Booker Prize will come to McEwan [The Longlist will be revealed August 10th, '05].<br /><br />He proves with this novel that he is a writer worthy of the Nobel.	2005-04-28

Because this book (translated by Giovanni Pontiero) seems so different from the other Saramagos I have read (translated by Margaret Jull Costa)... well, it makes me wish I could read the original version. Really.<br />All this aside, the book only solidifies my previous conviction that Saramago is the best living author in the world today.<br />For die-hard Christian biblical literalists TGATJC will come down hard, like a spike in the foot, for sure. At times it may seem downright blasphemous.<br />But the \\"fact\\" remains that much of Jesus's earthly life is in the realm of obscurantism, biblically and otherwise. There is much about him that we do not KNOW! Theologically speaking, Saramago definitely presents and elaborates upon what is known as a \\"Christology from below\\" (that which emphasizes the humanity, the human nature of Christ) as opposed to a \\"Christology from above\\" (that which would emphasize the divinity of Christ). Saramago's Jesus BECOMES the Christ. It is significant that in the novel, nowhere is he called Christ, except in the title of the book.<br />It is a profound and engaging exploration of the self-realization of Jesus of Nazareth. Not meant to be a comparative text to the Bible, nor meant to replace the Bible. An account, written by one who is definitely familiar with the Bible, yet does not subscribe to a personal faith in its tenets. He is avowedly atheist.<br />Some Christian readers would be summarily offended by this book. Others, like myself, (a Christian) would not. Statistically speaking, I would not recommend it as the next selection for the Women's Aglow book club!<br /><br />It is a stretch, yes. But all proper exercise begins with a few stretches.<br />I found it to be positively invigorating.<br />T.y.L.i.I.	2005-04-23

Ames, a widower, marries a much younger woman who blesses him with a son in his old age. Now in his seventies and in somewhat failing health, so much of what John would love to communicate to his son must be sort of.... postponed. Post-dated. He therefore embarks on the record of an account of his own personal history, in the hope that his (at the time) seven-year old son will read it when he himself is an adult.<br /><br />Enter now into the mix the town prodigal, Jack Boughton.<br /><br />Jack's return to Gilead becomes a sort of Waterloo for Ames. A rapport develops between Jack and John's son, one in which John himself at times feels displaced and nearly irrelevant in comparison. I will not say more.... but there IS more. Much more.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about this book, John's book, as it were, is that I believe he learns more about himself, in the writing of it, than his son will ever learn, in the reading of it.<br /><br />John has to come to terms with the presence of Jack, and with what his presence means.<br /><br />The simplicity with which Robinson develops this character of Jack Boughton... it is simply amazing. He becomes for me, (and for John) the main character in this book.<br /><br />Is there a real place called Gilead, Iowa?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />But Gilead is a town in the Old Testament of the Bible, and in the ancient Hebrew the closest meaning for the word \\"Gilead\\" is \\"stronghold.\\"<br /><br />Somehow I am sure that Marilynne Robinson is aware of this!<br /><br />Gilead... the town, represents a certain type of \\"stronghold\\" in each of the lives so closely outlined here... the lives of John and Jack. For John, we find that Gilead represents the stronghold of normalcy. Quietness. Not that John has never left town, in fact we learn that he did (briefly). But really, for John, Gilead has represented the idea of obedience and continuity. A sort of sustained innocence.<br /><br />For Jack, we learn that Gilead represents the stronghold of disruption. Noise. He left Gilead because he had to. And he returned because he needed to. And for him it ends up representing a sort of earned innocence (if at all) and that received from a most unlikely source.<br /><br />But the beauty of the book is that it bursts with grace.<br /><br />This book is a quiet diamond amid shelves of zirconia, really it is.nd Jack.

This is essential CanLit 101.<br /><br />Iconic!<br /><br />For the longest time I have intended to read Margaret Laurence, and this is where I have started. I now know that I will continue on and read more of her work, especially the other Manawaka books in the series.<br /><br />I think we are looking at some essential Canadian literature here, and yet, nearly every high school student from St John's to Victoria would rise up and say \\"What? Are you nuts?\\" As much as this book is inflicted upon the high-schoolers of Canada, it sure has not gained a welcome reception by that age group! For the Canadian teenager, seeing The Stone Angel on the English syllabus has become the equivalent of.... hmmm what would one say? Having a radio that is locked on the CBC station?<br /><br />I believe this is because The Stone Angel is a book that is all about the \\"interior\\" and to truly love the book the reader must have an appreciation of the life processes involved in becoming an elderly person.  From start to finish we are on the inside of this character Hagar Shipley. It is not the realm of the exciting pace and involved plotline. This book is rather a very somber, brooding, introspective look at a proud and uncompromising woman in her nineties. She is a woman who does not (in the slightest) want to succumb to the realities, adjustments, and inconveniences of aging and dying. As she faces the combined trauma of diminished health and loss of meaningful relationships, she has to come to terms with who she really is.<br /><br />How far will her incessant pride and irritable crankiness get her in this last year of her life? How can she escape from those who try to make it all easier for her? Will she confess her unmitigated (and inevitable) need of others... of those who truly, and undauntingly, care for her well-being? Will she break down or remain haughty?<br /><br />Laurence is simply brilliant in that she weaves a seamless web between the present and the past, between Hagar's current experience and her memories.<br /><br />It is not easy, the transition[s] that we who will live on into old age will have to make if we are to succeed at being old. This book pulls no punches with how difficult the process can be, especially for the type \\"A\\" personality.<br /><br />It is no accident that the book begins with the lines from Dylan Thomas:<br /><br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />It is a story about a woman who raged. And yet (in my opinion)there is not one real angry tirade in it! It is (I think) a different sort of \\"raging\\" that is being dealt with here in the story, as with the poem by Thomas. It is not the kind of raging that is with gritted teeth and defiance, [denial] it is the kind of raging that is mingled with profound sadness and regret... yes, anger too I suppose, but anger only because one has to leave behind so much of what one loves.<br /><br />Here is the realistic journey of a woman who has to come to terms with the fact that \\"what's going to happen can't be delayed indefinitely.\\"<br /><br />I think the book is somewhat of a masterpiece.

For me to sit down and consume an entire novel in \\"one go\\" is something that is quite rare, but that is exactly what happened yesterday with The Reader.<br /><br />It is a testament to the writer's ability to keep me entranced and involved with the story that once I started, I could not stop.<br /><br />The Reader is a first person narration of the life, from fifteen years onward, of one Michael Berg, in post-war Germany. As a fifteen year old he meets the vivacious 36-year old Frau Schmitz (Hanna), and he will never be the same.<br /><br />Everything about her affects him for a lifetime, in ways that he could never have imagined.<br /><br />In short pithy chapters and an economic style that never bogs down, Schlink separates the major phases of Michael's involvement with Hanna into three Parts.<br /><br />Part 1 is where we learn of Michael's sexual initiation and subsequent emotional attachment to Hanna. Serious page-flipping stuff!<br /><br />In Part 2 we are drawn into a courtroom situation (Michael is a law student) in which he is as shocked as the reader (us) to learn of the horrific nature of Hanna's secrets.<br /><br />Part 3 outlines the way in which Michael attempts to bury the past, as best he can. But it is not possible. It is not possible. Michael's past is exhumed. There were moments in this section that I found gut-wrenchingly sad, yet, presented in a beautiful way. (How does one say it?) It is brutal. Brutal sad and shockingly so.<br /><br />I will not go into WHY the book is called The Reader. That would be saying too much, I think.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. You will sink into it quickly. But not as though into quicksand. You will walk away from it, perhaps with a heavy heart (that is one thing I should say. There is nothing humorous about this book)... your heart may be heavy afterwards, but only because it will carry the weight of knowing that there are beautiful things to be felt towards those who have done even the most atrocious things imaginable.<br /><br />Love is love.br />Love is love. <br />	2005-01-17

I cannot think of an author who uses the device of digression moreso than Saramago. For me, the near-constant philosophizing of the narrator and the characters is one of the things that I love the most about his work. This is the fifth Saramago book I have read and it has helped me arrive at the conclusion that he is my favorite living author.<br /><br />There is no point in my re-stating the plot or storyline because the amazon page itself (above) really provides a perfect synopsis. So do the fine reviews that follow mine here on this page. But here is the one thing that I would ask the prospective reader to ponder...<br /><br />What would it be like to suddenly find that there is another person in the world that is exactly like you, in every respect? Another YOU! A double. A doppelganger.<br /><br />In its psychological twistings and turnings and in a writing style that is as wonderful and coherent as it is inimitable and unorthodox, this is the very question that Saramago brings the reader FACE to FACE with!<br /><br />My initial answer to the question was \\"Hmmm, no big deal. So what? I have a double. Who cares?\\" With The Double, Saramago has now blown the lid off of such an easy answer. Sure, the book is not ABOUT me or you, but in Tertuliano Maximo we see shades of who we all are. And the thoughtful (and patient) reader will find that they are drawn into a vortex of identity trauma along with the protagonist himself.<br /><br />Who AM I, if there is another me?<br /><br />Be patient with the book, especially if you are new to Jose Saramago... give it time, you will be rewarded. Stick with the convolutions and dialogues with \\"common sense\\"... the absolutely crazy ending is worth it all.<br /><br />Saramago. What can one say? He is the literature teacher's worst nightmare! He does not even use \\"proper\\" punctuation. Most conventional rules of writing are thrown to the wind. Like one reviewer noted, J.S. even tells you ahead of time what is going to happen to his characters later on in the story. It is crazy.<br /><br />Is The Double a good book to start with if you are new to Saramago? Not really, in my opinion.

This book was truly enjoyable, eminently readable, and never boring.<br /><br />Bruce Feiler set out on this journey as one who held to a rather Cecil B. DeMille-like literal interpretation of everything to be found in the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch).<br /><br />What he discovered, however, is that there is a lot of discrepancy as to the exact locations of the events described in the Bible, and that the real world, especially as presided over by border guards and umpteen officials, is not all that generous in providing him with every shred of archaeological data that he is interested in accumulating. He meets with hostility and suspicion, all along the way.<br /><br />Ahh, but it is the times that he meets with cooperation, hospitality and likemindedness that make the book interesting. Wonderfully interesting locals, and countless expatriates, who have relocated to the Middle East to be closer to what they percieve as the biblical foundation of their beliefs and cultural heritage..... these people, along with Feiler's Israeli guide, Avner Goren, provide the real insight into the discoveries that Feiler makes.<br /><br />So many times the reader feels that they are a part of the starlit campfire summations of the day's adventures, times in which the Bible is read aloud and thereafter discussed within sight of the actual areas described in the text.<br /><br />His [Feiler's] conclusion is that the Bible is \\"chameleon-like\\" in that it has the ability to continually reinvent itself.<br /><br />As U.S.A. Today has summarized: \\"Bruce Feiler went looking for proof. He learned that proof doesn't matter.\\"<br /><br />In essence, the author found that a lot of what he had previously thought of as a biblical presentation of literal event and/or historical truth was neither historically verifiable, nor truthfully accurate.<br /><br />The amazing thing is this, though. The experience of the desert and the meeting of those who live there today, combined to convince the author that a litero-historical interpretation of the Pentateuch is not a necessary pre-requisite to genuine spiritual experience, which he maintains he had, during his journey. The spiritual (and if amazon allowed italics I would italicize the word \\"spiritual\\" there) relevance of the Pentateuch is as alive today as it ever was.<br /><br />It is a profoundly enlightening, rewarding read.<br /><br />I highly recommend Feiler's book to all readers interested in the subjects of the Middle East and Old Testament biblical interpretation, in general.litero-historical interpretation of the Pentateuch is not a necessary pre-requisite to genuine spiritual experience, which he maintains he had, during his journey.

This Christmas, just last week, I read this final installment in the continuing series of books by William Horwood. I've read his other three, and of course, Grahame's endearing and unforgettable template. This one, The Willows At Christmas leaves me wishing that there were more of the stories to read.<br /><br />I am old.<br /><br />But these stories refresh me, and rekindle the youngster in me.<br /><br />All that Mole wants is a nice peaceful Christmas (don't we all?)... to have a little party on Twelfth Night, and sip his famous \\"sloe and blackberry\\" with his newly acquired friends Toad, Badger, Ratty and Otter. Along with this, a reunion with his long-lost sister would be nice also. He begins to try to arrange a get together at Mole End, but soon finds that a guest at Toad Hall is throwing the countryside into a state of fear and downright Yuletide attrition! Horwood introduces us to the villainous Mrs. Ffleshe... the veritable Cruella DeVille of the Riverbank! She has taken over Toad Hall and the once proud Toad is reduced to humiliating servitude until (no real surprise) even WORSE things happen to him!<br /><br />Yep. Only THIS time Mole is also caught in the same trap, and Christmas joy of any kind now seems to be definitely beyond reach!<br /><br />Every available resource and ingenuity must be called upon if Mole and Toad are to be rescued, and Christmas restored to its proper place of peace and joyful togetherness.<br /><br />The Willows At Christmas is a great story about the power of friendship and loyalty, justice and forgiveness, and the beauty of reunion.<br /><br />Horwood once again proves that he is worthy of carrying on in the tradition of the one and only Kenneth Grahame. A lofty task.<br /><br />Is it only a book for kids?<br /><br />Yes, but no matter what AGE they find themselves to be!	2005-01-02

The only other Salinger work I have read is Catcher.<br /><br />But these nine stories, well they are just wonderful. I must highly recommend them, as being stories that will somewhere, at some point, touch something deep within any reader. They will resonate.<br /><br />What confounds me, what astounds me, is how Salinger takes such mundane (seemingly mundane) vignettes, and then just rips them, tears them.... somewhere among the final lines of each. Provides just that little wee twist.<br /><br />These aren't \\"mysteries\\" per se.<br /><br />Yet, they ARE, in that each goes much beyond what it says.<br /><br />They ARE mysteries.<br /><br />Nine EXPERIENCES! Nine believeable HIDDEN CAMERAS..... tape-recordings (the dialogue is utterly superb)... each story will leave you with personal \\"hmmmmms\\" to ponder.<br /><br />In my opinion.... a great book for book clubs, really. Much discusssion to follow each installment.... even though the stories are so OLD!<br /><br />They are TIMELESS!<br /><br />I once said that Flannery O'Connor was the greatest 20th Century short-story-teller.<br /><br />Now, I am not so sure!<br /><br />I honestly think Salinger surpasses her work, in relevance, in cadence. Everything here is definitely timeless.... read it now today, or twenty years from now, it's going to be every bit as meaningful and wonderful.<br /><br />My favorites? For Esme - With Love And Squalor, followed by A Perfect Day For Bananafish, and Teddy.... in no apparent order.<br /><br />De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period was also beautiful. Fantastic. How can anyone even categorize such work? Each is a masterpiece in itself.<br /><br />I loved all nine.<br /><br />T.y.L.i.I.	2004-12-05

As many reviewers have noted, Runaway resonates in the mind of the reader with a force that is usually attributed to the concussive thump of a powerful novel. I would agree, it is as though we are getting eight compressed novels in Runaway... six, to be precise, since three of the stories are sequentially connected to each other.<br /><br />So wonderful is her characterization and style that I would have remained interested, if any story had been expanded to be the length of a novel.<br /><br />Having only read one other Munro collection (Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage), I am no expert on her work. However, I would say that I enjoyed this book more than the other, simply because these stories seem to me to have a better resolve about them. They close, but they are not closed. Fine-tuned, their open-ended endings beg to be reflected upon. Runaway was an excellent source of near-endless discussion in my own elite Book Club of Two.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any and all. I was thrilled to happen to have my TV on one evening, to see the elegant Alice rise and accept the Giller Prize, for Runaway.  I joined in the applause, and startled the cat.<br /><br />The stories are centered around the lives and experiences of women, that is to say, women are the protagonists of each story. As a male reader, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the themes, the motifs, the relevance and style of each story, and conclude that Munro is not a writer only FOR women. Men who enjoy the very best that writing has to offer us today, should read her.<br /><br />I think my own favorite story was Tricks. The twist of fate, the \\"trick\\" in this story alone, is worth the acquisition of and reading of this book.<br /><br />Runaway is unforgettably good, and makes me want to go on and explore all things Munrovian. The wonderland of Alice Munro.	2004-11-22

It is not a children's story, really, I think it is a grown-up's story. For one thing, it is written in J.S.'s inimitable run-on style. It's easy to follow, but not exactly a textbook study in conventional punctuation!<br /><br />And to mention too much about the actual story itself, well, I wouldn't want to ruin even one minute of the new reader's twenty. It is wonderful, and wonderfully done. The quest. The dreamer's quest.<br /><br />What I find remarkable about the book is that in these few short pages, the author (and really, is there anyone quite like J.S.?) shows us that the Dreamer's confidence and assurance can quickly inspire the same sort of quest in the heart of someone who has been living their life in the mundane (dreamless?) state. And not only this. But this newly inspired (transferred) dream, which causes the second person to leave their comfort zone and embrace the dream with their own very being can quickly become the principal motivating force behind the FULFILLMENT of the dream. The first dreamer now finds that they NEED their new companion, their new dream-partner.<br /><br />To say more is to say too much. It is really a wonderful little story.<br /><br />Light a candle, and read. And before the candle really gets going, you will be done the reading.<br /><br />J.S. is the wizard of storytelling.	2004-11-13

But I have decided to give my chapters prime numbers 2,3,5,7,11,13 and so on because I like prime numbers.\\"<br /><br />So says Christopher Boone, the protagonist, and REAL author of this book. Indeed, this is the first book I have ever read, in which the chapter numbers exceed the page numbers, and it is not the book's only unique feature. Charts, graphs, pictures, maps, photos... all of these media are employed by Mark Haddon, to help us see into the complex mind of the autistic Christopher.<br /><br />When Christopher discovers a neighbor's murdered poodle, he sets out on a quest to unmask the murderer. What he ends up discovering could not be further from his (or the reader's) suspicions.<br /><br />The earth-shattering revelation sends Christopher on a new, and unsuspected journey... one fraught with nerve-rattling moments of sensory overload as he narrowly escapes (time and again) from those who would try to thwart his progress.<br /><br />It is a story of the hero's journey, the hero being equipped, in this case, with nothing other than amazingly keen powers of observation, a (thankfully) unused Swiss-Army knife, his father's bank-access card, and an unswerving desire to re-identify with the love and acceptance of his parents.<br /><br />I found the book very unputdownable. For all of its digressions, it remains fast-paced, exciting, swift, engaging and wonderfully witty.	2004-10-25

Well, I have yet to read a book by Dr. Peck that did not leave me grateful. This one is no exception.<br />A dear friend asked me why I read so many Peck books. Is it so that I can gain the needed insight to become a better person? Or is it moreso to be made aware of why I am not that better person already? To be reminded of my failings?<br />My own answer is sort of a variegated gradation of &quot;no&quot; to all of the above, and yet my vague explanations always seem to involve a simple desire for greater awareness. Peck's books are not really &quot;how-to&quot; things, but moreso &quot;why we do&quot; or &quot;here-is-what-happens-when...&quot; and this approach interests me more than &quot;how to.&quot;<br />More theoretical than practical, you might say. (Just like me!) This is why I am hooked.<br />This book discusses how we relate to each other in business, family, the workplace, and in the greater society, and is based on the premise that the way we are generally doing it... is sick, and in need of attention/repair. On a linear continuum stretching from psychology to sociology, I would place this book somewhere between his The Road Less Travelled on the former end, and The Different Drum on the latter.<br />The one chapter on vocation is worth it all.<br />Phrase by phrase, let Peck delineate how he comes to his definitive conclusion that &quot;civility is consciously motivated organizational behavior that is ethical in submission to a Higher Power.&quot;<br />If those last two words make you feel like you're passing a kidney stone, or perhaps giving birth to a prize-winning pumpkin... relax. Let him explain. It's never as painful as it first sounds.<br />When I suggested above that this book is more theoretical (why) than practical (how-to), I should really clarify that assumption, especially since the latter portions of the book discuss the specific work of the Foundation For Community Encouragement, an organization that literally &quot;teaches&quot; community (civility) to corporations and groups of all kinds, worldwide. Very practical stuff indeed.<br />But what I meant is that even here, the principles that Peck expounds, theoretically speaking, are universally applicable and relevant. The same principles that will save a corporation from ruin will help strengthen a marriage, or cause improved relations between parents and children, or help a single person live a more fulfilled life.<br />Patients would ask Peck &quot;How do I know when to quit therapy?&quot;<br />He would answer &quot;When you have learned how to be your own therapist; when therapy has become a way of life for you.&quot; (p.340).<br />I like that answer, and it's why I keep reading and re-reading him.y) to corporations and groups of all kinds, worldwide.

I just think it is superb, in its style and content... to be honest, I think that Donoghue creates someone here, in this character of Mary Saunders, even more memorable than Anna K., and believe me, I am a die-hard Tolstoyite!<br />Mary is forced into extremities, she is driven into a latter half of an 18th century London that, quite frankly, will use her to its (and her) limits. Anyone who knows history knows that London is ready for such a challenge.<br />Does relocation help Mary? Her move to a more rural setting?<br />Not really. Vice is not population-specific. Vice is everywhere.<br />Mary gets caught in a web she did not want to weave. She makes a valiant and sincere attempt to change her ways with a risk-laden move from London to Monmouth... will her intentions be able to get her through the realities that await her?<br />(I wish we could utilize italics here at amazon... I would have definitely opted for italics on \\"intentions\\" and \\"realities\\" there.)<br />This book is about the difference between intentions and realities. How the best intentions, can go astray!<br />Nathaniel Hawthorne would have got a kick out of Donoghues's work. It is so unequivocably good. Every sub-character will jab you in the butt to remind you that he/she is real, much less the main ones... which (believe me) you will never forget.<br />Donaghue is a genius. Some sort of literary savant. The book is worth whatever price, and a generous tip besides.<br />You will laugh, and you will weep.<br />What price tag can you affix to that?<br />Affix it, and pay it. This book is worth it.<br />Take it from a guy who reads too much for his own good.	2004-05-31

And more importantly, not what is COULD be. This is not a book about despair, or about resignation to fate. It is not a backward look at problems, but a forward glance, a look into the author's sense that &quot;the future will be what we make it.&quot; (p.98). It speaks to the responsibility inherent in all of us, no matter who we are, no matter where we live, to begin to identify with a concept of planetary solidarity, as opposed to regional and ideological exclusion.<br />I think it would be safe to say that Maalouf argues that such a radical paradigmatic shift is not only essential to the maintenance of &quot;humanity&quot; it is also the only thing that can ensure our very survival.<br />I challenge anyone who does not agree with Maalouf's emphasis upon the importance of identity, to read any one chapter of this book, and then pick up any major newspaper of our day and age. Sad to say, but this book is front page news... every damn day! In its PRE-9/11-ness, (written in 1996) this book is a prophetic scroll unearthed. Hence, in its POST-9/11-ness, it is impossible to exaggerate its importance.<br />For me, a great benefit of reading the thing, was to see the history of Christianity and Islam in a way that I had never considered before. Wow!<br />Also, while not being in any way a condemnation of democracy, Maalouf outlines several reasons why the West's unquestioned veneration of democracy ought to be tempered with a realization that there are vantage points other than (and higher than) Mount McKinley's, from which Western ideals are looked upon, by other people of this earth.<br />One of the most crucial questions this book forces the reader to ask themself is this: &quot;To what extent is the global culture, as it develops daily, essentially Western or even specifically American?&quot; (p.114).<br />This is a short book. Easily readable. You will enjoy it, trust me... you will wish he wrote more, not less!<br />You owe it to yourself, if you are a thinking person, to think about reading this book. And then, after thinking about it, do it.<br />&quot;Life is a creator of differences.&quot; (p.20).<br />&quot;I dream not of a world where religion no longer has any place but of one where the need for spirituality will no longer be associated with the need to belong.&quot; (p.96).<br />I can't dream of a worthier dream being dreamed by any dreamer.had never considered before.

After two decades of studying the Bible and consulting books about the Bible, I can honestly say that I have never read anything as lucid, informative, thorough, illuminating, and critically relevant as Kass's book on Genesis.<br />It is unlike any other commentary I am aware of, in that, rather than being set up as a standard verse-by-verse exposition, it follows the ideas and the storyline of Genesis in a coherent, chronological format. Nothing is omitted from discussion, or avoided, every verse is treated, but always in a way that lends itself to a greater understanding of the integrated whole of Genesis. Kass's expert interaction with the text is a result of his twenty years of teaching a seminar on Genesis, and his commitment to the premise that &quot;to discover the meaning, a text must be studied in its own terms.&quot; (p.14).<br />What we need is &quot;a disinterested and philosophic pursuit of the truth&quot; (p.2). By disinterested Kass means a pursuit without an agenda, without a bias (without prior assumptions, religious or otherwise) and by philosophic, simply &quot;wisdom-seeking&quot;. And by truth, well, to me that is one of the great things about the book... the author believes that there IS such a thing as truth, and wisdom, for that matter. A seemingly rare position to hold, among today's modern academia.<br />He says that there are three methodological assumptions on how to read Genesis. The first is to read thoroughly skeptically, in which case the reader would most likely want to quit reading after just a few pages. Secondly, entirely by faith, by which the reader already believes everything even prior to reading the first few pages. Thirdly, the way of &quot;thoughtful engagement&quot;, by which the reader suspends his/her disbelief and has an earnest desire to simply let the text speak for itself. Much as we would do with other literary works, even novels. This third method is the one Kass advocates as being his own, and encourages all readers to adopt.<br />In doing so, he presents an assessment of Genesis that is quite different from what I may have heard in my own seminary education, but it is one that I regret not having adopted sooner.<br />For I have learned more in reading this book, than in all of my previous years of formal instruction.<br />As another reviewer has pointed out, here we see the biblical characters as they really were... not just Bible Superheros, not infallible demi-gods (as they are often portrayed) but as real live people who made as many bad judgements as good, and were not always as pious or Godly as we readily assume.<br />Aside from all of this, the book is readable. By that, I mean, it is not pedantically smudgy nor needlessly polysyllabic. It is clear, it is so wonderfully readable and clear-headed, and laced with footnotes, often describing how the source of his findings came not from himself, but from his students and colleages.<br />He states his purpose clearly. &quot;First, to demonstrate by example a wisdom-seeking approach to the Bible that attempts to understand the text in its own terms yet tries to show how such an understanding may address us in our current situation of moral and spiritual neediness. Second, to recover in their full power the stories of Genesis as tales to live with, as stories illuminating some of the most important and enduring questions of human existence. Third, to make at least plausible the power of the Biblical approach and response to these questions, with its emphasis on righteousness, holiness, and reverence for the divine.&quot; (p.13).<br />Does the book succeed, regarding these goals?<br />Yes.<br />Is there a better book on understanding Genesis available today?<br />No.<br />Could this book in itself be any better than it is?<br />No.adopt.<BR>In doing so, he presents an assessment of Genesis that is quite different from what I may have heard in my own seminary education, but it is one that I regret not having adopted sooner.<BR>For I have learned more in reading this book, than in all of my previous years of formal instruction.<BR>As another reviewer has pointed out, here we see the biblical characters as they really were... not just Bible Superheros, not infallible demi-gods (as they are often portrayed) but as real live people who made as many bad judgements as good, and were not always as pious or Godly as we readily assume.<BR>Aside from all of this, the book is readable.

A dear friend suggested a few Flan stories to me, and I guess I got hooked. With this volume consumed, I can now say I have read all of the published short stories of this fantastic writer.<br />O' Connor's work is fantastic in the way my dictionary describes the word. &quot;Conceived by unrestrained fancy.&quot; These stories are nearly always shocking, actually very shocking. They are powerful character driven things, and rather than describe them as &quot;horror&quot; stories as I see some reviewers do, I would moreso call them &quot;grotesques.&quot;<br />They involve characters that are not so much &quot;horrible&quot; or &quot;horrorful&quot; as much as they are simply ludicrous, or incongruously composed or disposed. Caught up in all manner of inner bigotries, hypocrisy, fanaticism of one sort or another (most often religious). O'Connor characters often turn out to be homicidal, suicidal, brutal, obsessed, the opposite of what they appear to be, and always, if nothing else... shocking!<br />I am no connoisseur of the short story genre but all I know is that these stories without fail, intrigued me. Opened a door to further contemplation, and went a bit beyond what they said.<br />For sheer brilliance of sentence structure, visualization, suspense, I think it would be fair to say that there are few writers that have ever written as clearly as Flannery O' Connor.<br />When I am reading literature, characters better dang well talk good, and talk like people, not like characters. The dialogue in this collection is one of its strongest points. Impeccable down-south vernacular.<br />As for verisimilitude, well that is another mentionable thing here. If they are anything, these stories are bizarre, and yet they retain that quality of appearing to be true. Appearing to be possible. But the last thing that they are (hear me now, if hearing nothing else), these are NOT happily-ever-after stories.<br />Hell no.<br />They are most often direct flights into the realm of the reprehensible and least optimistic aspects (propensities) of human nature.<br />For those who care, my own favorite story was probably The Lame Shall Enter First.<br />T.y.L.i.I.e and least optimistic aspects (propensities) of human nature.<BR>For those who care, my own favorite story was probably The Lame Shall Enter First.<BR>T.y.L.i.I.	2004-02-02

Reading Collins has given me a greater appreciation for the potential of free verse. He has affected my own writing in what I am currently interpreting as a positive way...<br />I've forgotten how to rhyme / But that's O.K. / Perhaps was tyme!<br />These poems evoke recognition in the reader. For the most part, we can participate in them. They deal with simple things we can identify with. Like saxophones, dreams, clouds, writing as a craft, the Blues, a really good cigarette... and meat.<br />And speaking of meat, I have christened Osso Buco as my favorite Collins poem to date. I think of it as a little hymn to domestic contentment, which is &quot;something you don't hear much about in poetry.&quot; But there is a wonderful undertone running through this poem... that the great things in history did not necessarily take place in the atmosphere of satiated bliss here described, and at first glance, seemingly lauded.<br />This is what I love so much about his stuff. The intelligent playfulness, the game involving what is said, and what is meant. What we see on the page is like the one-sixth of the iceberg above water... there is so much beneath, in and around the words.<br />There is always something more to think about when you come to the last line of a Collins poem.<br />There is nothing trite about this collection. I've taken about a month to read through these fifty poems, because each is like a meal in itself. The book is not a party-platter of bite-size hors d'oeuvres. Nothing is measly.

It is accessible to the somewhat poetically challenged (as I consider myself to be). But beyond this... just the use of the words, the FIT of the words, the powerful (yet subtle) sort of surreptitious little attack in the end of each poem, always making the reader go... \\"Hmmm\\".<br />Collins is a wordsmith, and exquisitely so. Satisfying. He is to the typewriter what Bruce Hornsby is to the piano. You listen to both, and when they're done their thing, you say to yourself \\"It would be very difficult to have done that any better.\\"<br />Billy Collins makes me feel like everything is a poem waiting to happen. This is because he chooses a lot of common occurrence, simple things to write about. Stuff like spending an afternoon examining ancient maps in a library while the rain falls outside. Or stopping to pick wisteria from the side of the road. Waking up with a wicked hangover. Kafka picking up a pen and promptly changing you into a goldfish or a lost mitten, or (better yet) the New York Public Library. How about having your own faithful table lamp showing up at your funeral... \\"like an old servant, dragging the tail of its cord / the small circle of mourners parting to make room.\\"<br />Wonderful stuff. Everyday stuff like that.<br />He's witty and terse; thematically timeless / He's all in free verse, and totally rhymeless.<br />4.5 exploding stars!	2003-12-03

Prior to reading this book I knew very little about Sigmund Freud, and already quite a bit about C.S. Lewis. To be honest, my initial interest in purchasing and reading the book was based on my shameless/addictive quest to own and read everything I possibly can, about LEWIS.<br />Having said that though, I am glad to have learned so much about Freud in the process. I think that the author does a good job of presenting the viewpoints of each man, with respect to their opinions on such topics as Creation, Conscience, Religious Conversion, Happiness, Sex, Love, Pain, and Death.<br />Big issues. Worthy of big, deeply felt convictions. And each man had them.<br />So many reviewers here have speculated that the author does not write this book from a disinterested stance, that he in fact, favors Lewis, and presents him as being a more consistent and (for lack of a better word) healthy individual. I agree that Lewis does come off as being such. But what is most important to me (as a reader of the information) is... is it TRUE? Is this slant toward Lewis as a more self-actualized person fair? Or is it fabricated? Is it manufactured? Is Lewis deliberately favored?<br />Hmmm...<br />Dr. Nicholi has studied the philosophical writings of both men for over twenty-five years, and teaches a course at Harvard based on an examination of these two worldviews. Somehow, I do not imagine this present book as some latent \\"hate-on\\" for Freud finally making itself known in printed form. It did not appear that way for me, although yes, Lewis does come across as being someone who lived a more personally fulfilled, whole life.<br />I believe that the quotation marks speak for themselves. This is a well-researched book, I do not feel that Dr. Nicholi is really putting words or ideas INTO the mouth and mind of either figure. Over thirty-five pages of endnotes! In my opinion, this is one of those \\"let the chips fall where they may\\" type things!<br />As is stated in the Prologue, the philosophical speculations (the worldviews, if you will) of these two men are not at all ambiguous. \\"One of them begins with the basic premise that God does not exist, the other with the premise that He does. They are, therefore, mutually exclusive - if one is right, the other must be wrong. Does it really make any difference to know which one is which? Both Freud and Lewis thought so. They spent a good portion of their lives exploring these issues, repeatedly asking the the question 'Is it true?'\\"<br />Both men are presented as having troubled childhoods... both being touched with profound losses, alienations, disillusionments, etc. One of the main things that becomes clear in this book is that one of these men discovered the possibility of transcending this pain and disconnectedness experienced in childhood, and the other, quite frankly, did not.<br />Neither of them were ever perfect, and neither of them were ever perfect[ed]. Both men made great contributions to the fields for which they were formally trained (English Literature / Psychology)... yet both dabbled in these philosophical areas where they each OUGHT to have been out of their depth. This is what makes them so interesting to us.<br />My one criticism of TQOG is that there is a bit too much repetition of previously mentioned actual stories and/or quotes. But overall, I was impressed with the wealth of information and the dovetailing of ideas. It really IS as though these dudes are debating.

This is a theme that is never far from the center of what Peck is writing about, and now I can say that in his fiction, he remains as Peckish as ever. I, for one, do not mind this at all... it's an important theme, and I believe he does a wonderful job of incorporating it into this novel.<br />Willow Glen is a nursing home, usually quite serene and unassuming. It is a well-run (one of the finest in the state), respectable institution. Who would think that it is literally percolating just this side of murder? Late one night the grisly crime takes place, and all of a sudden everyone from resident to employee is thrust into the category of &quot;suspect&quot;.<br />As Detective Petri begins his investigation, he soon finds that no-one is more &quot;suspect&quot; than Willow Glen's most loved and respected nurse, Heather Barsten. Not only was she one of two nurses on duty in C-Wing the night of the crime, but she also had a personal relationship with the victim that seems to incriminate her beyond any doubt in the mind of Petri.<br />At first, he relentlessly focuses on Heather. But his subsequent interviews with certain residents and staff begin to reveal that the net ought to be cast much wider, and soon Petri is as confused as the reader.<br />Really, as a &quot;whodunnit&quot; sort of thing, I thought the novel was excellent. My own initial hunches proved false in the end, as the possibilities were many, and Peck did well in keeping the reader (me) in suspense.<br />Where the novel may weigh heavy with many readers is in the fact that it is laced with a LOT of psychological theory, sometimes veering into the theological. It can be said that the book's real theme is this thing about coming to a place of awareness/wholeness... it ends up being a process that nearly every single character has to personally deal with in their life. Three of the characters (in my opinion) represent people that are already at a high level of personal awareness (or one might even use Maslow's term &quot;self-actualization&quot; here)... pretty much everyone else is fraught with serious problems and unresolved issues in their personal lives. (This is an accurate reflection of a concept that Peck discusses elsewhere in his non-fictional books... to paraphrase, simply that ALL people, Peck himself included, are mentally ill to a certain degree. In other words, we differ not in presence of illness, but rather in degree of incapacitation). This is a concept that I happen to agree with, and therefore I don't mind seeing it in force in this fictional account of a bunch of people.<br />Some people in A Bed By The Window are drawn toward these three &quot;aware&quot; characters (I purposely do not reveal who they are, in this review)... and others are repulsed by them.<br />We come to see the results of either action!<br />And it makes for a great book. Well worth reading. I found it to be a real page-turner. The lack of a fifth star is only due to the fact that it seems that TOO MANY things were resolved in the end. Too many people made that leap into profound soulwork... even for fiction. In a perfect world, perhaps it would be so.<br />Another big theme in this story may be something like &quot;If we see only what is on the surface of life (in our own life, and in the life of others) we do not see very much.&quot; True self-awareness is all about digging, searching, and asking questions of what lies in, around, and even behind, our motives and actions.<br />As Dr. Kolnietz (who I see as the fictional embodiment of the author) says on p.242: &quot;We are as sick as our secrets.

She commented, several times, that &quot;language and observation make this book a sustained poem&quot; and I agreed. Her perspective was needed and appreciated. It is definitely a book ABOUT women and FOR women, but us dudes can get something out of it too... because it is brilliantly written.<br />It is not only an &quot;Atwood&quot; but one of the better &quot;Atwoods&quot;!<br />The author has stated that Cat's Eye is &quot;about how girlhood traumas continue into adult life&quot; and that is it in a nutshell.<br />When the painter Elaine Risley returns to Toronto for a retrospective of her work, she is confronted with the memories of her childhood... mysteries to unravel, others to tie up and lay to rest. Elaine the child, had a temperament that allowed other girls to belittle and dominate her.<br />In a word, she was bullied.<br />And no one bullied her as much as Cordelia did.<br />When Elaine is brought back to the geography of her past, she finds that she has to come to terms with her feelings about Cordelia... this retrospective of her WORK turns into a retrospective of her LIFE.<br />Through flashbacks galore, and in writing that is spare and bleeding with cut-wrist exposure, Atwood leaves no part of Elaine's wounds unsalted.<br />Here is a question that I think the thoughtful reader will be asked to ponder:<br />Does &quot;closure&quot; mean annihilation/renunciation of memory, or acceptance/reconciliation of memory?<br />Or as my friend and I put it: Does Elaine still have her Cat's Eye with her when she returns to Vancouver?<br />This is not a plot-driven, but a personality or character driven book. Those who think that sound-bites on T.V. are too lengthy should probably stay away from it.<br />Cat's Eye would be a great Book Club selection because of the discussion and opinion that it is sure to stimulate.

It was cute, uplifting, and inspirational. However, these last two adjectives may describe the very kind of thing that parents feel wary about from time to time... \\"So, what is this guy preaching in here?\\" they may rightfully ask.<br />Well, this little book does touch on some rather serious questions.<br />Things like \\"What's reincarnation?\\" and \\"How do you know that our souls live on after we die?\\" Both questions are asked by the protagonist, the young girl Jenny.<br />The first question is answered matter-of-factly, but the second question is answered in the typical respectful and non-sectarian way that Peck approaches spiritual issues in all of his works. Jenny's dad answers her... \\"That's a very big question. In fact, it's so big I'm not going to answer it. You see, some questions are so big you shouldn't take anyone else's answer for them. It's better if you figure out your own. Often, I think that's why we're put here: to find some solutions for ourselves. I tell you what though, I'd be delighted to listen to any answer you come up with.\\" (with \\"you\\" in italics).<br />In my opinion... this is a good answer to the question. You may have a different opinion on that, and you should let that be your guide as to whether this is the type of book you want to read to your children. (Or not)! Because really, this is the tone of the story, in a nutshell.<br />It is framed around the event of Jenny having a single snowflake land on her nose and promptly melt. This simple experience causes her to begin wondering about randomness, and consequently, her own special place in the world. She comes to the point of concluding that she is, in fact... special, and unique. As unique as a snowflake, and more specifically her own friendly snowflake, the snowflake that found her nose.<br />In the Foreword, Peck says \\"Being who I am, this is naturally a spiritual sort of story. It is meant to be read in such a way by young people with old souls and older people with young souls.\\"<br />I, being one of these latter type, truly enjoyed it.

And she says it in a big way.<br />This novel takes place in the early years of the 20th Century, among the German-occupied colonies of South-West Africa. From her earliest years as an orphan, Hanna X, the main character in Brink's novel, suffers incredible amounts of abuse. First off, there is the unreasonable strictness of Frau Agathe to deal with. Beatings are a regular thing at the orphanage \\"because it is a Christian place where evil will not be tolerated.\\" Then there is the lecherous priest, Pastor Ulrich, who violates her physically and spiritually. Then, a series of transitional periods where the young Hanna is shipped from one place to another, and these experiences always result in trauma, disappointment, disillusionment. Her life becomes characterized by alienation, loneliness, pain, loss, and denigration.<br />Throughout all of this, Hanna hangs on to a fleeting childhood memory, something she refers to as \\"The Time Before\\"... in which she remembers meeting an Irish girl named Susan at the beach of the Weser in Bremen. Susan gave Hanna a shell, and told her to listen to its inner sounds. Hanna keeps this shell, and for her it comes to represent the \\"silence which she carries deep within her, from the lost time before she ever arrived at the orphanage...\\"<br />When Hanna hears that hundreds of women are regularly being shipped from Hamburg to the remote African colonies to serve as wives for the men stationed there... she signs up. What could be worse than what she is presently experiencing?<br />She arrives at Swakopmund, and ends up at an extremely remote secular nunnery known as Frauenstein.<br />Here (and on the way here) she will learn that there are places worse than the orphanage. Much worse.<br />What follows is a very dark story. Do not be mistaken, this is a story difficult to read for its brutal depictions of torture and violence, but written in a style and with an imagery that is evocative, unmistakingly vivid, even beautiful.<br />However, this is in no way a beautiful story where all is resolved at the end. Where justice has its day, where all is made right. One ought to be prepared for this fact.<br />It shows the most absolutely horrid aspects of human nature, and always face-up, in the full light of the hot sun. Not only are the perpetrators of crimes against Hanna (the heroine) shown in all of their shameless ghastliness, but she herself becomes nearly as brutal in the latter half of the book. There comes a time when Hanna says \\"No more\\" and understandably, we want her to succeed in her plans for vengeance against the greatest of crimes that have been commited against her. She assembles a ragtag band of vigilantes, those who have suffered injustices of their own, and together they set out on a quest to reclaim dignity, with Hanna as their (mute) leader.<br />This is a difficult book, but only because of its subject matter.

A cat goes missing. Filthy rich owner offers an outrageous reward for the return of the cat. City becomes a rabid, raging mob of cat hunters... violence and mayhem ensue...<br />It's actually a great idea, and I am sure something LIKE this would, in fact, happen... it's quite believable. Think of it... two million bucks to whoever can find this cat! I would be out there too, ramming my pauper's cranium right into recycle bins and garbage cans... CITYWIDE! And clobbering anyone who got in my way!<br />At times this book is captivating, I will say that much. But I should have paid more attention to the dustjacket blurb that said it is a &quot;dark and mischievous satire&quot; before I tore into the story. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I came at it with a full awareness that the author is not trying to write a realistic story. The things that go on in Cat's Crossing are so absolutely far-fetched (co-incidence wise, and otherwise)... that it lost me. It lost its credibilty for me.<br />If the author ever reads this review, please Mr. Cameron, send me an email and chastise me.... correctify me, and I swear, I will recant and show my sincerity by deleting this review.<br />I hate to give a book with such a good IDEA... two stars.<br />But seriously, am I supposed to BELIEVE this story?<br />Firstly, this cat (Jones)... he thinks like a person. Feline Anthropomorphism has escaped and is running amok! His initial escape from the house is so that he can seek out a healing herb for his injured hip! Later, when he finds himself in a certain home, he drowns another cat by repeatedly dunking its head under water... there are no sounds or seeming counter-attack from the other cat... the occupant of the house does not even hear any kafuffle going on. Now, if this were really taking place... even the neighbours would hear it! But what is with this methodical human-like homicide (caticide?) in the first place... does any cat really think his crime through like this?<br />Jones seemed to stop just short of smoking cigars behind the barn!<br /><br />Secondly, this unnamed city is supposed to have a population of three million people... but from the co-incidental wanderings of this cat... you would swear that this city could not possibly contain more than twenty or thirty homes. I mean, the cat goes straight to places where this person knows that person who is related to that other person etc., etc.<br />But thirdly, and probably most annoying is the fact that the characters (all of them) do things that are so inconsistent with who they were two chapters earlier... that it is truly disturbing. I would give examples, but it would ruin the story yet worse for those who have not dived into it yet.<br />I want to give the thing the benefit of the doubt... maybe I just read it in the complete wrong frame of mind? When I read a book I sort of like to be saying to myself &quot;Yes... it would be just like that&quot; but I found that I seldom, if ever, said those words to myself as I read this one. So, if you like &quot;stark realism&quot; too... this book will not do it for you.<br />It was disappointing... like a colander with holes so big that the pasta noodles fall right out into the sink!the first place... does any cat really think his crime through like this?<BR>Jones seemed to stop just short of smoking cigars behind the barn!<BR> <BR>Secondly, this unnamed city is supposed to have a population of three million people... but from the co-incidental wanderings of this cat... you would swear that this city could not possibly contain more than twenty or thirty homes.

No true die-hard student of C.S. Lewis can pass on a reading of this book, and here's why:<br />Lenten Lands provides a perspective of Lewis that you can get nowhere else... the perspective of a stepson.<br />There are many books about Lewis the academician, Lewis the lay-theologian... Lewis the prolific author/poet... but a first-hand account of Lewis the around-the-house stepdad? Trust me, you will find THAT nowhere but here!<br />And it's an important perspective, this day-to-day life at the Kilns in Oxford, because many misconceptions about Lewis are cleared up in the midst of Douglas Gresham's recollections.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this is technically a biography of Douglas Gresham rather than of C.S. Lewis. The opening chapters are of the Gresham family in Staatsburg, New York. Then, in 1953, as a child, Douglas met Lewis for the first time in Oxford. By this time, Joy Davidman (Douglas' mother) was already acquainted with Lewis. Three years later (1956) the two were married in the Registry Office, but not before Joy's illness was already fairly advanced. The following year (1957) their vows are re-instated by the Rev. Peter Bide in Wingfield-Morris Hospital. Three years later Joy dies from cancer.<br />Then, three years after this, on a somber November evening while eighteen-year-old Douglas is still digesting the fact that President Kennedy has just been assassinated, he receives the news that Lewis has died.<br />\\"On that day... there was a bitter stillness about the world; for the second time in my life everything I knew, everything I held dear and the one person I loved had been swept away.\\" I found this portion of the book to be especially moving.<br />The following year (1964) Douglas' birth father commits suicide.<br />A few final chapters tell of Douglas' own marriage and settlings in Tasmania and mainland Australia.<br />But the bulk of Lenten Lands consists of Douglas' decade of knowing C.S. Lewis. A very well-written book, the title being borrowed from a phrase in Joy's epitaph, written by Lewis.<br />As I read Lenten Lands I was reminded of something C.S. Lewis said long before ever knowing the Greshams. In his \\"Abolition of Man\\" (published 1943) he said \\"I myself do not enjoy the society of small children... I recognize this as a defect in myself.\\"<br />Again, in a private letter to his friend Arthur Greeves (December 1935) Lewis commented \\"I theoretically hold that one ought to like children, but I am shy with them in practice.\\"<br />Yet Douglas concludes that his decade of knowing Lewis was a \\"privilege\\"... \\"a gift of education and experience greater than some of us gain in a lifetime.\\"<br />His statement confirms my own suspicion about Lewis... that he was a man of such inner greatness, that he proved to be good even at the things he was not good at.a phrase in Joy's epitaph, written by Lewis.<BR>As I read Lenten Lands I was reminded of something C.S.

Campolo says &quot;A religious group matures and improves only by correcting its flaws, and usually the enemies of that group can help it to see those flaws better than its friends can.&quot; This idea is the force behind the whole flow of &quot;Partly Right&quot; and since I am in up-front agreement with Campolo's premise, I found his entire argument to be quite compelling, and very educational.<br />Christians can be notorious for their offhand dismissal of those who criticize their religion, while never really taking the time to study or understand the belief systems of their detractors. Campolo wants to address this problem, and while admitting that his book is not meant to be an exhaustive treatment, he selects several significant critics of &quot;bourgeois&quot; or &quot;middle-class&quot; Christianity and seeks to fill us in on where they are coming from.<br />He considers the worldviews of Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Freud (and the Neo-Freudians), Marx, and Dostoevsky.<br />The author presents (what I consider to be) a very fair summary of the philosophies of these great intellectuals, and clearly explains the main issues upon which their criticisms of the middle-class church were focused.<br />And wherever possible, the author adds that little dash of Campolo humor that his readers have come to expect from him.<br />Dr. Campolo, a world-class scholar, is professor of sociology at Eastern College in St. David's, Pennsylvania. He is the author of so many great books, all of which seem to appropriately challenge some aspect of traditional Christianity. Some readers tend to get offended at his &quot;say-it-like-it-is&quot; style. Campolo does not mind stepping on the choir's toes, and sometimes maybe goes out of his way to do so. But I, for one, am always grateful for his brutal honesty, and controversial, thought-provoking insights.	2003-04-15

Michael Holme is a man haunted by the past... it's been ten years since, in a rash fit of artistically motivated egotism he willfully left the love of his life, Julia McNicholl, and moved from Venice to London.<br />Now, as second violinist with the Maggiore Quartet, Michael leads a relatively routine performer's life: constant rehearsals, a decent bachelor pad, not quite enough money to own a car, an early morning weekly swim in a dingy river, a borrowed violin, and a half-hearted relationship with a woman that is like cheap wine compared to the champagne he has left behind.<br />Every day, he thinks of Julia, but his repeated attempts to contact her have proved futile... it is as though she has vanished from the face of the earth.<br />One day Michael is riding the bus, and he sees Julia in another bus, travelling in the same direction... for that moment his world has stopped turning, and she is but five feet from him. As one might expect, he is frantic. This chance sighting begins the process of re-acquaintance, but the real reunion of these two souls is fraught with many unexpected obstacles.<br />Julia herself is a musician, a concert pianist. And, in the intervening years (the lost decade) she has not exactly been sitting around pining away for Michael. She has moved on with her life in many significant ways, and this revelation causes no end of new pain and frustration for Michael. And for her.<br />I do not want to say any more about the storyline from this point on, because any comments can only spoil things for anyone that is even now reaching for the book.<br />Pick it up. It's actually quite good... Seth does a fine job with a theme that I would summarize in these words:<br />When it comes to intense personal relationships, we can re-visit history, but we cannot re-write it.<br />Both of these characters are torn, torn by feelings past and present, and both are forced to learn heart-rending lessons about themselves.<br />Vikram Seth is not kidding when he says \\"Music to me is dearer even than speech.\\"<br />There is a LOT of music (musical jargon, musical theory etc.) in An Equal Music. But it was not incomprehensible or overwhelming for a reader like myself, even though I know diddly-squat about music theory. Just roll with it (I say) and stick around for the relevant twists in the realistically bittersweet rather than happily-ever-after ending.\\"Music to me is dearer even than speech.\\"<BR>There is a LOT of music (musical jargon, musical theory etc.) in An Equal Music.

Shipwrecks is a book about how a remote, extremely isolated Japanese coastal village depends on plundered shipwrecks for its sustenance. It is set in medieval times.<br />These shipwrecks are known as &quot;O-fune-sama&quot;. To say that these villagers are destitute is, if anything, an understatement. Every springtime sees more and more of the villagers having to sell themselves into indentured servitude to support their family. Fathers are usually the first to go.<br />Everyone left behind in the village hopes... indeed, BASES their entire continued existence on the good fortune of an O-fune-sama wrecking itself on their reefs, thus providing their village with a life-giving bounty of rice, utensils, wine, and unheard-of delicacies.<br />Yoshimura's story-telling lense focuses on the plight of nine year old Isaku and his family. His father has already left for indentured service, and Isaku, as the eldest male, is left to provide food for his mother and siblings. He develops his craft as a fisherman. Isaku, as a character, is by far, the strongest point in this novel. Well done. Yoshimura did well in providing a glimpse into the struggle of Isaku's forced initiation into the realm of responsible manhood.<br />Isaku soon learns the mysterious origin of the salt cauldrons that burn on the beach all night long, when he is asked to tend to these fires.<br />The fires are meant to lure floundering cargo-laden ships in the night... to coax them onto the treacherous shoals... to run them aground. These ships are subsequently plundered for all the goods on board, and the crew is slaughtered.<br />Isaku becomes a witness and recipient of one of these bounties. He, along with the rest of the village, longs for a similar occurence the following year. After all, Isaku's father is about due to return. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to present him with prosperity, however ill-gotten it may be?<br />Well, what the heedless waves bring these villagers next... is not quite what was expected, nor desired.<br />Yoshimura has written a good story, but I am of the opinion that a bit may have been lost on the English translation. (Do medieval Japanese really say &quot;I reckon&quot; as Mark Ealey suggests they do in chapter 8)?<br />I found &quot;Shipwrecks&quot; to be poignant in a few respects... but overall unmemorable in most.r desired.<br />Yoshimura has written a good story, but I am of the opinion that a bit may have been lost on the English translation.

This book was a selection in our reading group and we were unanimous in our enjoyment of it. It remains our highest rated of all books we've read over an eighteen month period, and one of my all-time faves.<br />It is set in postcolonial Trinidad, and is filled with the wonderful idioms of Trinidadian English.<br />Mr. Biswas' expectations and dreams are not all that grandiose (or so it would seem). I mean, all the poor guy wants is a house of his own, some dignity and privacy... some distance between his own family and the irritations of his in-laws, the pushy, domineering Tulsis.<br />But all of his efforts seem to meet with calamity. Time after time, through events hilarious, but at times, downright sad, we learn to love to pity Mr. Biswas.<br />We follow him through a plethora of jobs, from sign painter and plantation overseer (Mr. Biswas miserable) to hilariously inventive and ever-optimistic journalist (Mr. Biswas happy).<br />We continue to hope his ship will come in, and we stay with him throughout his entire life as son, husband, father, and family man until his final triumph... a very peculiar house of his own.<br />The strength of the book is in how Naipaul uses humor to portray the un-funny struggle that people in impoverished circumstances face when trying to reach even modest goals.<br />As such, Mr. Biswas' world is presented as realistically bleak as ever, in a novel that isn't.<br />A poignant book, maybe even flawless.	2003-04-07

Being male, I found that reading this book along with my female friend helped me to appreciate it more than I would have on my own. She commented, several times, that &quot;language and observation make this book a sustained poem&quot; and I agreed several times. Her perspective was needed and appreciated. It is definitely a book ABOUT women and FOR women, but us dudes can get something out of it too... because it is brilliantly written.<br />It is not only an &quot;Atwood&quot; but one of the better &quot;Atwoods&quot;!<br />The author has stated that Cat's Eye is &quot;about how girlhood traumas continue into adult life&quot; and that is it in a nutshell.<br />When the painter Elaine Risley returns to Toronto for a retrospective of her work, she is confronted with the memories of her childhood... mysteries to unravel, others to tie up and lay to rest. Elaine the child, had a temperament that allowed other girls to belittle and dominate her.<br />In a word, she was bullied.<br />And no one bullied her as much as Cordelia did.<br />When Elaine is brought back to the geography of her past, she finds that she has to come to terms with her feelings about Cordelia... this retrospective of her WORK turns into a retrospective of her LIFE.<br />Through flashbacks galore, and in writing that is spare and bleeding with cut-wrist exposure, Atwood leaves no part of Elaine's wounds unsalted.<br />Here is a question that I think the thoughtful reader will be asked to ponder:<br />Does &quot;closure&quot; mean annihilation/renunciation of memory, or acceptance/reconciliation of memory?<br />Or as my friend and I put it: Does Elaine still have her Cat's Eye with her when she returns to Vancouver?<br />This is not a plot-driven, but a personality or character driven book. Those who think that sound-bites on T.V. are too lengthy should probably stay away from it.<br />Cat's Eye would be a great Book Club selection because of the discussion and opinion that it is sure to stimulate. I'm going to rate it closer to five stars than four.loser to five stars than four.	2003-03-31

Thomas Homer-Dixon states his purpose in the Prologue:<br />&quot;In this book I'll argue that the complexity, unpredictability, and pace of events in our world, and the severity of global environmental stress, are soaring. If our societies are to manage their affairs and improve their well-being they will need more ingenuity - that is, more ideas for solving their technical and social problems. But societies, whether rich or poor, can't always supply the ingenuity they need at the right times and places. As a result, some face an ingenuity gap: a shortfall between their rapidly rising need for ingenuity and their inadequate supply.&quot;<br />After reading him, I believe him. This book is very convincing, and it is (what seems to me) an unbiased look at the real situation facing our planet not only environmentally, but socially, and economically.<br />Homer-Dixon has travelled the world, exploring the situations that give rise to the &quot;ingenuity gap&quot;. Partial exposure to the world (Western prosperity etc.), can lead us to adopt misinformed and unrealistically optimistic conclusions about how we will manage future difficulties. This book takes off the rose-colored glasses, exposing us to some harsh UV rays of reality!<br />Can the world be sustained by solar energy?<br />This books says NO!<br />In 1960 the income of the richest 20% of the world's population was 30 times that of the poorest 20%. In 1998, it was 82 times greater.<br />Let this book educate you to the coming problems that are likely to result from this increasing (and unchecked) economic disparity. Wow, its sobering.<br />All of this is startling, but nowhere is the ingenuity gap more disturbing than in the problems related to the environment. There are existing challenges that we can barely understand, let alone address. We've all heard about the greenhouse effect. Blah,blah, blah! Right? Ozone layer, big hole... big deal! Am I right?<br />Well, when we say that this factor could change the earth's overall temperature by 2 degrees, we should remember that the difference between today's climate and the coldest period of the last ice age, is only about 5 degrees!<br />I mean, get out the Gore-Tex! This is serious stuff.<br />Population?<br />Between 1960 and the year 2000, the population of the world has doubled! Currently, if everyone were spread out across the habitable land of the earth, we would all be within calling distance of each other (about 100 metres apart, in every direction). This is sobering.<br />Homer-Dixon travels the world within the pages of this book. This guy is really collecting the Air-Miles! He lets us tag along: through North, Central, and South America, Europe, Asia, India. The reader might as well be a piece of carry-on luggage! He puts together a very eloquently written synopsis of the challenges that mankind faces. There are portions of this book, that when one realizes were written prior to Sept. 11, 2001... are just downright PROPHETIC!<br />The book is divided into four parts/sections, which are presented as questions. I close my review by answering these questions with my newly acquired Homer-Dixonian knowledge:<br />1. How Are We Changing Our Relationship To The World?<br />Dramatically! Between 1/3 and 1/2 of the planet's land area has been fundamentally transformed by our actions. (p.54) Let's not even get into what we have been doing to the oceans! (But he does).<br />2. Do We Need More Ingenuity To Solve The Problems Of The Future?<br />Yes! If we were to know the true state of our situation, we would feel the sort of panic one feels when strapped into an out-of-control jet liner on its way to a crash-landing. (I'm extrapolating/summarizing here).<br />3. Can We Supply The Ingenuity We Need?<br />Probably not. It is theoretically possible, but unlikely, given the current rate of gap widening set against the boundaried limitation of our brains. It is much easier to create certain problems than solve them.<br />4.

It is a great story, skilfully woven, laced with trademark Atwood satiric wit and all of the brand-name dropping you've come to expect: Drano, Holiday Inn, McDonald's, Elastoplast, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Bank of Nova Scotia, Chatelaine magazine, Ovaltine, Crest toothpaste, and not just soup, but Campbell's Chicken Noodle. I love how she does this, it seems so... Canadian!<br />The strength of Bodily Harm is the way Atwood delves deep into the psyche of the protagonist, the young female Toronto journalist, Rennie Wilford. Flashback portions reveal Rennie's history, connecting us to her narrow/stifled/religiously-hypocritical upbringing in backwater Griswold Ontario. It's a history she resents. Flashbacks illuminate her relationship history also. We really get to KNOW Rennie, and the more light that Atwood throws across this life, the more Rennie emerges as someone unfulfilled at her core.<br />And now Rennie's life is on the fritz. She is coming to terms with her partial mastectomy and the recent breakup with Jake, two problems that she imagines are directly related to each other. She becomes obsessed with the word &quot;malignant&quot; and feels that everyone dear to her (even her own body) is rejecting her. On top of this, someone has just broken into her apartment and, instead of robbing her, has left behind an ominous threatening message.<br />Change of scenery is badly needed.<br />So Rennie accepts a Caribbean assignment to the island of St. Antoine, and now comes the part of the story that could be summarized by saying &quot;Shoulda stayed at home!&quot;<br />This &quot;tropical paradise&quot; is really an economically depressed dump! And her small-town Ontario naivete is no match for the shifty characters she meets on this island. She is soon intricately involved in the political turmoil of St. Antoine, and her trip ends up being everything BUT the paradise and recuperation she was hoping for.<br />Illegal smuggling, bloodshed, betrayal, malnourishment, imprisonment... forget emotional improvement, physical survival becomes the issue!<br />It's as though Rennie goes to St. Antoine because of bodily harm from within, and finds that she must leave the island because of bodily harm from without. There's more to the story than this for sure, but this is an interesting aspect of it. The island did nothing to solve her problems, but it certainly made her see those problems for what they were... a part of her life, but not the whole.rayal, malnourishment, imprisonment... forget emotional improvement, physical survival becomes the issue! <BR>It's as though Rennie goes to St. Antoine because of bodily harm from within, and finds that she must leave the island because of bodily harm from without.

Lewis fan can possibly live a meaningful life without this book.<br />When I greedily approached &quot;C.S. Lewis: Mere Christian&quot; I was no stranger to the world and writings of C.S. Lewis. I've been studying his work for over a decade. But Lindskoog's book opened up realms of understanding about the man and his thought that I could not possibly have held together and formulated on my own. Her knowledge of each area of Lewis' thought is not only the knowledge of a well-read enthusiast (as mine may perhaps be), but here in her work one gets the sense of a profound scholar who has actually met the man. (And she did, by the way). She speaks with such authority that each summary dazzles the reader, awakening an important point hitherto unrealized. Here you will not find a boring half-hearted amalgam of foot-noted facts, but a living and cohesive story worthy of the depth and consistency of C.S. Lewis himself.<br />For instance, in my favorite chapter, entitled &quot;Prayer&quot; the author cites Lewis' marvelous poem of the same name, and comments that &quot;he warned readers not to take the last line too seriously.&quot; This, I realized much later, is an allusion to Lewis' own comments in a book of his own, entitled &quot;Prayer: Letters To Malcolm&quot;. Not many of us are blessed with such a concordance-like Lindskoogian grasp of Lewis' thought. And truly, that is the beauty of her achievement here. As you are gripped by her easy flowing writing style, you almost forget that you are getting a Ph.D. in Lewisology. Reading this book is like cramming forty topically-arranged C.S. Lewis books into your head with the ease and delight of sipping a cup of coffee.<br />And this brings me to my vacation.<br />When I took &quot;Mere Christian&quot; along with me to Vancouver Island one fine summer, I found that instead of enjoying the ocean as much as I should have, I was more likely to be found tucked away in some coffee shop... taking notes on napkins, looking up only long enough to see that the sun had gone down.<br />This book makes you crazy like that.<br />C.S. Lewis died thirteen days before I was born. I have often wished, and wished sincerely, that I could have talked with this man who has meant so much to me in my life. I look forward to doing so in heaven. This book is the closest I have come to doing so on earth.y long enough to see that the sun had gone down.<BR>This book makes you crazy like that. <BR>C.S.

US	48245725	R1GVLFCFU47CH3	0312261543	460494300	Chasing the Red, White, and Blue: A Journey in Tocqueville's Footsteps Through Contemporary America	Books	5	1	2	N	N	All aboard the American Dream/Nightmare!	My alternate review title was \\"Disparity, but not Despair-ity\\" but I settled on what you see above. One thing this book says loud and clear is that the once direct relationship between hard work and the American Dream has never been more fragile. Things have changed, and are ever changing!<br />Cohen's book shows us that for some, the American Dream is alive and well... but for a larger percentage of Americans, the dream has become a nightmare. This work is a real eye-opening 20/20-like expose, and one that reads like a freight train blasting through myth. \\"Chasing\\" in the title is an accurate description of the pace.<br />The premise is brilliant and engaging. Cohen, an award winning British/South African journalist comes to America to retrace the 170-year-old steps of Alexis De Tocqueville, writer of the famous treatise \\"Democracy In America\\". The itinerary includes New York City; Flint, Michigan; The Ohio River Valley; The Mississippi Delta; The Deep South; and Washington, D.C.<br />Cohen diverts from Tocqueville's original journey only by adding California, the new frontier and command center of the information age.<br />What struck Tocqueville most, back in 1831, was the \\"equality of conditions\\" among the Americans then. This, and \\"self-interest, properly understood\\" were Tocqueville's greatest impressions and formed the basis of his praise of the American way of life.<br />Cohen is an expert on Tocqueville and is well-versed in the great man's journals. As he makes his way across America he interviews a diverse sampling (in my opinion, a well sought-out cross-section of the have's and the have-not's) and compares these findings against the fulcrum of equality Tocqueville described.<br />What does Cohen find?<br />An ever-widening gap between the have's and the have-nots!<br />Things have changed. He finds that Tocqueville's work is full of unqualified conclusions and summary statements that do not possibly reflect the general populace of America in the last half century. Beyond being out dated and inaccurate when applied to modern times, it's questionable whether it was even all that accurate at the time it was originally written. By marginalizing his findings on blacks and Indians, Tocqueville trivialized them. By failing to qualify his conclusions he helped to perpetuate an idealized view of America that he never saw.<br />Tocqueville's findings are further skewed (says Cohen) because the people he interviewed were not a balanced group. Not an unbiased cross-section of \\"Americans\\" at the time. They were always successful, professional elite (privileged aristocrats of the time) always male, and always white.<br />Cohen wants to avoid a similar mistake this time around... and I applaud his riding of buses, to find the pulse of the common man/woman. Every indication seems to point toward a widening gap between the rich and the poor in America, and the author tells the story in an engaging, (humorous where appropriate) way. There is a section where he sends fictitious e-mails to Tocqueville and I just loved this section. The whole book is a gem, and no part lags.<br />By the way, it is just as NOT anti-American as it is NOT pro-Anything Else... it is just disturbingly truthful. Amazingly, in spite of the facts, it shows that the American spirit is alive and well... as I mentioned above, there is unquestioned disparity, but not despair-ity!<br />But perhaps the prevailing message of this book can be expressed by the guy right there in Chapter One, the chapter on New York. There was most assuredly a time when any American would have said that a million bucks would be enough to quit working forever. This guy in New York though, he says \\"Twenty million and I'll walk.\\"<br />Twenty million!<br />That's how far we've progressed along the \\"wealth\\" continuum... some people honestly feel that they will need twenty million before they quit chasing the red, white and blue!<br />All aboard!.

Pool's book is a well-paced survey of the industry that produced the greater (well-known) Victorian novels. By &quot;industry&quot; is meant process. He covers the development of publishing houses, writers, lending libraries, serials, trans-atlantic markets, and the innovative way that enterprising book distributors managed to bring their product to the public. It all combines for a fascinating story, and Pool does it well.<br />It could be said that he focuses on three writers, these being Charles Dickens, Charlotte Bronte, and William Makepeace Thackeray. These three (along with Marian Evans a.k.a. George Eliot) played a vital role in the development of the Victorian novel, and they comprise the bulk of Pool's discussion.<br />The interaction and intrigues between the main three authors make for National Enquirer-like fodder... with the difference that this stuff is TRUE! Truly, there were &quot;rows and romances&quot; as the subtitle suggests.<br />The Victorian era was an exciting, but very demanding (downright scary) time to be an author. There were the restraints of format (the serial novel had to be written in self-contained installments; the &quot;triple-decker&quot; had to be able to be neatly split in three), there was the gender prejudice (one ought not to be a woman writer), and there was the ubiquitous spirit of cut-throat competition and jealousy in this burgeoning literary world. Only the strong survived, and only the versatile were recognized at all.<br />The latter third of the book covers the rise of great writers like Wilkie Collins, Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James.<br />The author takes a subject having the potential of being dry as crackers and presents it as a sprawling and wonderfully connected story. Good work. Reading this book made me realize that there is a HISTORY to the easy access to good literature we enjoy in our day and age, and made me appreciate those many pioneers who cut the swath to it.	2003-01-27

At twenty-nine years old he is already a specialist on everything Victorian. If there's anything to know about the Victorian era, Anthony knows it.<br />While attending a series of seminars in California, he decides to indulge in a few days of rest and relaxation before heading home to Montreal. One night, alone in his hotel room, Anthony has a profound dream about London England...<br />He suddenly awakes and when he looks out his window, finds that down below on the huge hotel parking lot, a complete exhibition of Victorian culture has appeared overnight.<br />He climbs out of the window and wanders among the endless aisles of Victoriana and is soon met by a man asking \\"Are you in charge of this?\\"<br />Without understanding why... he replies \\"Yes\\" and from that moment when Anthony claims ownership of The Great Victorian Collection, he will never be the same.<br />What follows is a truly realistic treatment of what would happen to someone who found themselves in this truly unrealistic situation.<br />A bewildered Anthony tries to process the fact that his \\"dream\\" brought this spectacle into existence, while everyone from the hotel manager, the law enforcement agencies, the press, television media, the surrounding community... descend upon him for an explanation of how he has done such a thing.<br />We're not talking about a few doilies and candle-snuffers here! There are gigantic working fountains... a locomotive... entire buildings that were not there the night before! Previously unknown collections within the collection... rolltop desks with handwritten letters locked within!<br />Of course, he does not have an answer. He only knows it's there. Everyone sees it. And he's responsible for it.<br />This collection consists of vivid replicas of existing Victoriana, and experts are called in to vouch for its authenticity. Most find that the stuff is so \\"good\\" that it is indistinguishable from the originals which are still located in their respective museums and locales around the world.<br />There seems to be no other explanation for how such a monstrous display has appeared here in Carmel-By-The-Sea (overnight, no less) than to conclude that Maloney DID in fact \\"dream\\" it into existence.<br />As such, he becomes a worldwide celebrity.<br />Many people believe his story, and many do not. The plot revolves around the way these supporters and detractors affect Maloney's psyche. It appears as though the previously unextraordinary and perfectly normal professor is now on the verge of going completely bonkers. And who can blame him?<br />The problem becomes the uncertainty that surrounds the perpetuity of the Collection. Will it slowly fade? Will it disappear overnight, as quickly, and inexplicably as it appeared? Is Maloney responsible (though his continued dreaming) to keep it in existence?<br />And what should be done with it if it does last forever? Should it become a Disneyland-like tourist attraction?<br />Maloney finds that if he tries to manipulate the Collection in his waking state, it begins to deteriorate. And the Collection becomes a nightmare to him. Can he turn over to the world what he has created? He attends to it with a jealous possessiveness, and finds that he cannot let go of it. Psychologically, the Collection imprisons him... creates unendurable insomnia, and other life-threatening perils.<br />Because of the initial scandal, and subsequent absence from the University, Maloney has long since lost his professorship... only to be offered it once again after he becomes an established celebrity.<br />Should he return to Montreal and try to re-establish a somewhat normal life... or stay with the Collection?<br />He is torn. His dream becomes a living nightmare.<br />There is so much more to the plot than I'm saying here in this review because I don't want to ruin anything for readers. There is the usual Moore romantic dalliancethrown in, and it's wonderful stuff.<br />The beauty of the book is the way Moore makes such an unrealistic situation seem like the most normal thing that could have happened. The way that Maloney and those around him react to the Collection seems very natural, very believable.<br />And all in all, the book reminds me why Moore is definitely one of my favorite writers of all time. This one is a real page-turner from start to finish.ful stuff.<BR>The beauty of the book is the way Moore makes such an unrealistic situation seem like the most normal thing that could have happened.

This very evening I discovered the joy of reading George Saunders...<br />\\"There were approximately fifteen hundred gappers living in the sea near Frip. Each Frip family had about ten goats. Therefore, there would normally be about five hundred gappers per yard, or fifty gappers per goat.\\"<br />What is a gapper?<br />Well, it is this baseball-like, Velcro-type crustacean with multitudinous eyes, that crawls out of the ocean at night along with (give or take) 1,499 of its buddies, all intent upon attaching themselves to local goats in a burr-like fashion. Side effects? Serious immediate goat-lassitude followed by actual withering, and depletion of milk supply!<br />Exactly! Of course!<br />It's fabulous.<br />Oh man... it's been a long while since I got so caught up into one of these child/adult books, the last time being Salman Rushdie's excellent \\"Haroun And The Sea Of Stories.\\"<br />This one is every bit as good, or better. And every bit as crazy.<br />Let me put it this way... I stumbled across this book in the store, sat down with it... read the whole thing, laughed... laughed some more... thought of many people I want to give this book to... and ended up purchasing five copies. One will be for my own re-reading.<br />It is hilarious, and meaningful all at once... as the slipcover says, it's an \\"adult story for children, a children's story for adults.\\"<br />The illustrations are superb, and the quality of the book is impeccable... a work of art.<br />It is a flawless imaginative work, that... while it makes you laugh at every second sentence, makes you realize that resourcefulness in the midst of undeserved adversity can really save the day! That selfishness is ugly... that neighbors ought to be... neighbors.<br />This little girl named Capable... she is a terrific role model for children.... and adults!<br />A brilliant work, and recommended without reservation. When you read this story to children the only question will be, who will love it more, you or them? Neither one loving it is simply an impossibility!s simply an impossibility!	2003-01-16

Everyone in this novel is obsessive-compulsive, and they are SO obsessive that they compulsed me to stay behind in the trees somewhere above the whirlpool. They are all dysfunctional, and this in itself does not make for a bad novel (necessarily), but in this case it does. Their obsessions do not seem believable. The coincidence of them all knowing each other only adds to the improbability of their existing at all. Here's the cast:<br />A man who ignores his beautiful wife because of his combined obsession with Canadian military history, and his fantasies about Laura Secord.<br />His wife... who lives in a tent in the woods near the whirlpool, and does nothing but read books (mostly the poetry of Browning). Her inner life revolves around her perceived connection with the swirling waters of the whirlpool which seem to call to her... to speak to her.<br />Then there's the poet-voyeur who accidently observes her in her wilderness setting because he too is obsessed with the whirlpool area. He becomes addicted to her (runs off with her shorn hair), befriends her husband to learn more about her, but cannot stand to be in her presence and avoids any verbal communication with her.<br />The superstitious undertaker-woman who loses her husband and parental in-laws to a mysterious plague all in one day, and is now forced to raise her speechless son on her own.<br />The speechless son who learns to repeat disconnected single words only after meeting the voyeur fellow. (?) Exactly.<br />The Old River Man who lives down by the whirlpool, and whose sole occupation is to use elaborate contraptions to fish drowned human bodies out of the water in exchange for booze from the undertaker woman.<br />The whirlpool is an area of water on the Canadian side, downriver of Niagara Falls, where this novel is set in the summer of 1889. All of these people interact with each other at one time or other, but the connection is weak in my opinion. There does not seem to be a unifying reason that any of them should even know each other. Like parentheses surrounding the novel, the first and last chapter are about Robert Browning... and I still don't get it!<br />I feel that this book suffers greatly because the actions of the protagonists seem too symbolic, unrealistic, and ethereal... everything seems to mean something else. To the point that nothing means anything.<br />Like a really long poem that you just \\"don't get!\\"<br />I got the book because I love some of Urquhart's other writings, and because I love Niagara Falls.

I'm still looking at the title page, the back of the dustjacket... anywhere, for the name of a co-author... but there isn't one. No, this is pure Michael J. Fox. As he says on the next-to-last page \\"I knew from the outset that I would have to write this book myself. The story was too personal for it to be told in anyone's words but my own.\\"<br />It's just amazing that someone so skilled as an actor should be equally skilled as an author. His memoir is so well-written.<br />I got it as a Christmas gift, and spent my holidays devouring it (in between actual turkey-feasts). Trust me, once you start reading the story, it's really difficult to put the book aside.<br />As my review title suggests, Fox does not opt for a straight-ahead chronological approach to his story. Maybe it was even written in a DeLorean! He begins by detailing his earliest experiences with Young-Onset Parkinsons Disease in 1990, then jumps back in time to his formative years growing up in various parts of Canada (1960's-70's)... then follows up with his meteoric (albeit arduous) rise to fame in Hollywood in the early 80's and beyond. It's this latter three-quarters of the book that is filled with flashbacks, relevant happenings, here's and there's, like puzzle pieces selected not neccessarily in chronological order, but definitely neccessary for a complete picture in the end.<br />The reader is never lost in this real-life maze, and Fox's skill as a writer can hardly be exaggerated. Some of the most moving sections are those which deal with his marriage to actress Tracy Pollan, to his battles with alcohol indulgence, his brain surgery in 1998, to his love for family (his real-life Family Ties)! Of course, Michael's behind-the-scenes (and in-front-of-the-scenes) struggle with Parkinson's is front and center as the main motivation for this memoir. [Incidentally, all author's profits from the book are being donated to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is yet another reason to pay the current Hardcover price!]<br />The book is sobering, it is deadly serious, and yet it is every bit as witty as Fox's television and movie persona.<br />In the last chapter, he says \\"Illness is a scary business, and somewhere deep inside, or maybe not so deep inside, we're all wondering if it could happen to us, and how we would cope if it did.\\"<br />This book is about how Michael J. Fox copes. Gut level, it's all played out curtains and cameras aside!<br />If you expect a depressing, downtrodden story, you will be disappointed. This is not the story of an unfortunate man.

I mean, that's not even the ladle part of The Big Dipper right?... I wish I could, but I can't. I felt as though the book was just on the edge of being better, but wasn't. It failed to \\"sweep me away\\" as it did for other reviewers here. But it is true that there is something very good here, something that makes me want to read Julie Otsuka's next book.<br />This story can be comfortably read in just one or two evenings. For such a compact book, the author does cover quite a bit of ground. We see how the mother prepares for the family to face their unjust fate, the father having no time to prepare at all, to the point of being taken away in his slippers and bathrobe. Then the uprooting and relocation of mother, daughter, and son... to a prison facility (let's call it what it is) in Utah, where they will spend 41 months... where they will alternate between being roasted and frozen as the seasons dictate, and are under constant guard, complete with searchlight sweeping the walls at night.<br />Each chapter focuses on a different perspective of what it was like to endure the undeserved shame, humiliation, and inconvenience (to put it mildly) of this post-Pearl Harbor Japanese internment camp.<br />There is a certain timeliness to reading Otsuka's story in the year 2002, with the term \\"racial profiling\\" not only affecting news headlines, but many people's daily lives.<br />In \\"When The Emperor Was Divine\\" this little family (and all Japanese people at the time) were degraded, and, in the interest of national security, were mistaken for the enemy en masse. When it was all over, the War Relocation Authority sent each person home (for some, their homes no longer existed) with train fare and $25.00 each (the same amount given to criminals when released from prison). And you only got this preferential treatment if you were willing to sign \\"loyalty papers\\"... as in, loyal to America.<br />The subject matter could hardly be more important, timely, and interesting.<br />But I found the style of the writing to be just a bit choppy. By that I mean, the fits and starts within the chapters, short scenes, times when I wondered which character was doing the thinking now etc.<br />Also the attention to detail seemed overdone at times (check out the girl's observations from the train on pages 26-27... I wondered \\"How slow is this train going anyway?\\") Also, the mother is watching kids play (seemingly) in the distance and she can hear their conversation... from inside the house? Bionic ears? Or really loud kids? I'm still not sure.<br />The final pages are the best part of the book, and the way that the family never returns to \\"happily ever after\\" days... it makes all the miscarriage of justice in the preceding pages all the more poignant.<br />Three stars.<br />O.K., so it's not a full ladle, but... it's a darn good complete handle!y be more important, timely, and interesting.<BR>But I found the style of the writing to be just a bit choppy.

If you're reading this, you have one! What could be more interesting than finding out more about it? How it works? How it fails us at times? And \\"why\\" it does both?<br />Well, Dr. Nuland is an expert in this field, and his book about the human body is just fantastic, I was thoroughly enthralled by it, from cover to cover. Just when the textbook-style facts verged on becoming tedious, Nuland would sensitively lace (suture?) everything together with a true-to-life surgical story that not only drove home the facts, but kept me in suspense... flipping the pages like it was a novel.<br />One of my specialties is being critical, and yet I cannot find a bad thing to say about this book.<br />Did you know that every time your heart beats, it is forcing blood into a network of arteries, veins, and capillaries that extend for tens of thousands of miles within your body? That's right... TENS of thousands! ...Of miles! Think about it. Did you know that if your folded-up brain were spread out, it would cover two-and-a-half square feet, and within this space are ten billion neurons and sixty trillion synapse connections? (Hey Mr. Gates... Pentium-Shmentium!)<br />Did you know that the human skin contains 2.5 million sweat glands?<br />Neither did I. But with this book you learn so much. Like, for instance, a sure-fire way to memorize the ten chemicals that make up the human body.<br />But \\"How We Live\\" is not just some sort of compendium of biological facts, it is an exciting journey through real life situations that we can all relate to or at least sympathize with. Some of the case histories here are just incredible.<br />Nuland covers everything from theories on the human spirit and the will to live, basic cell division, the reproductive act and system, the nerves and how they work, DNA and genetic structure, the heart, the digestive system, the brain, and how we think.<br />Did it bug me that Nuland (an agnostic) is not a creationist?<br />Sort of.<br />I am so 100% convinced that a real \\"living\\" God designed all that Nuland talks about in this book. So it sometimes bothered me to hear him attribute so much wonderful intricacy to the specious powers of evolution/natural selection. But I greatly appreciated his comment in the final chapter, where he said that, in the final analysis, \\"to espouse atheism is to be unscientific.\\"<br />Read the book to find out what this veteran medical scientist means by that statement.<br />Read this book to find out what Ralph Waldo Emerson meant when he said:<br />\\"One moment of a man's life is a fact so stupendous as to take the lustre out of all fiction.\\"<br />Read this book and nod your head in agreement with St. Augustine, who said:<br />\\"Men go forth to wonder at the heights of mountains, the huge waves of the sea, the broad flow of the rivers, the vast compass of the ocean, the course of the stars; and they pass by themselves without wondering.\\" (From Confessions, Book X, chapter 8).<br />Read How We Live, and do some proper wondering.A and genetic structure, the heart, the digestive system, the brain, and how we think.<BR>Did it bug me that Nuland (an agnostic) is not a creationist? <BR>Sort of. <BR>I am so 100% convinced that a real \\"living\\" God designed all that Nuland talks about in this book.

Not surprising for those familiar with Moore's novels, he comes storming out of the gates with a lighthearted sort of tongue-in-cheek contempt for religion (specifically Roman Catholicism) right on the first page, where young Gavin Burke is having an imaginary dialogue with the icon of the Divine Infant that stands watch over him from its perch on his bedroom dresser. Gavin no longer believes in God, yet he remains in dread of God's vengeance for the fact of this unbelief. He struggles with what he calls his Black Angel and White Angel which live, one on each shoulder. \\"The trouble was, the Black Angel seemed more intelligent; more his sort.\\" Comic dialogues with these invisible psychoanalysts abound in the novel.<br />The scene is Belfast Ireland, early stages of WWII. Seventeen year old Gavin enlists in the war effort to escape the responsibility of continuing his education and getting \\"a real job.\\" This is a great spin on one of Moore's oft-recurring themes... a young man struggling to make a go of it, and making wrongheaded decisions as he does so!<br />Gavin joins the A.R.P. (the First Aid Party, similar to a wartime emergency Red Cross). The boy has a totally negative self-image, and convinces himself that he is just \\"a second son that will never amount to anything.\\" He'll never be as successful as his older brother Owen, and will never meet his father's expectations of him.<br />So... he welcomes the War. As did many Ulster adults in that era, who oddly welcomed the advent of Hitler. They revelled in his havoc in Britain, and maintained the belief that the Fuhrer would never strike at their own little backwater towns anyway.<br />For Gavin, \\"War was freedom. Freedom from futures\\" (p.7). If there is a central idea in the book, this is it... it is a key theme in the novel. Believing those six words provided Gavin and many others with an excuse for not facing their personal problems. The ever-present, albeit unlikely, threat of attack provided distraction of all sorts.<br />The central drama is within Gavin's consciousness and in a bitter conflict between him and his father. Gavin's adolescent fantasies of power and achievement - sometimes sexual, sometimes iconoclastic - always rest on a knife-edge of indecision and powerlessness, of shame and humiliation. But these fantasies, and his father's equally self-serving political/philosophical beliefs are put to the test when the bombs fall.<br />It seems that Hitler has found Ireland on the map! This changes everything.<br />Father and son who have been bitter adversaries throughout the novel are reconciled through a shared knowledge of the horror of war. It proves to be more than either of them were ready for, and when they both return to their bombed-out house, they find that the war has changed a lot more than the physical landscape.<br />Those who know about Moore's own upbringing will see that there is much autobiographical content in this novel.<br />What a great book. My four stars is actually four-and-a-half!<br />A word about the title. It is borrowed from a Wallace Stevens poem. I looked it up in hopes of finding out why Moore chose this phrase as his title. The actual poem is very difficult, and far beyond the scope of this review to even half-examine.

This year, his 1987 book \\"In The Skin Of A Lion\\" was selected (by Canadians) as the book all Canadians should read, or in other words... \\"thee great Canadian novel\\" in a national project known as \\"Canada Reads.&quot;<br />Confession: I'm Canadian and I've never read any Ondaatje fiction. (GASP)!<br />But in honor of the Canada Reads project I bought \\"In The Skin Of A Lion\\" and just haven't read it yet. So, forgive me.<br />(And now, for the unforgivable)...<br />I thought I'd start off with delving into some of his poetry first.<br />Bad idea.<br />I picked up his \\"Handwriting\\" (poems written between 1993 and 1998, dealing mostly with a recollection of his homeland, Sri Lanka)... and I think I approached the book with as open or non-judgmental of an attitude as is possible.<br />But poem after poem I waited for some image or experience to provide meaning beyond the mere succession of words and snatches of unfinished thought, and nothing really worked for me. I finished the volume convinced that no reader can fully appreciate what is going on in these poems unless perhaps they happen to live within a ten mile radius of the events and scenes these poems describe.<br />Everything is in free verse, not a rhyme in the lot.<br />Note the following representative example, complete with a title nearly as long as the poem itself:<br />Driving with Dominic in the Southern Province We See Hints of the Circus<br />The tattered Hungarian tent<br />A man washing a trumpet<br />at a roadside tap<br />Children in the trees,<br />one falling<br />into the grip of another<br />Now come on, let's be serious, I could compose such a sequence in my own head in the time it takes to light a cigarette and blow out the match... and I don't even smoke!<br />I realize that Ondaatje fans will find those comments offensive, and it may be arguable that I am just too dense to appreciate Ondaatje's \\"delicacy and power\\" and \\"whimsical precision and authority\\" that the dustjacket promises to those that read beyond it... but, at the same time, I am not easily convinced of my own stupidity. I think I do know good poetry when I see it. And I do not judge Ondaatje AS A POET, especially since I have not read his other nine or ten published books of poetry, but I am singling out \\"Handwriting\\" as the only thing I've read so far. And I give it two stars for its occasional beauty:<br />The curve of the bridge<br />against her foot<br />her thin shadow falling<br />through slats<br />into water movement<br />Will this book keep me from reading that other stuff of his?

Besides being a really great read in its own right, The Sheltering Sky inspired great discussion in our reading group... more opinionated response than anything we've read in the previous twelve months.<br />Part of the reason for this is surely the depth with which Paul Bowles exposes the psyche of his two principle characters, Port and Kit Moresby. Yet the brilliance of his writing is that much is left hidden from view, there is almost infinite speculation (interpretation) as to the motives and inner thoughts of his characters. This American husband and wife, together with their friend Tunner, set off on the ultimate existentialist journey through post World War II Morocco. Individually, it will change, ruin, and even kill them. They experience the harshness of the Sahara desert, and a clash with Arab culture that goes beyond anything they were expecting.<br />It is Port's vision that initially spurs them on, a vision borne of his desire for \\"solitude and the proximity to infinite things\\" and a disdain for Western culture. But soon Kit and Tunner are forced to endure the uncaring Sahara on their own, and the novel focuses in on Kit's own spiritual disintegration. Her understandable inability to cope with a profound crisis and loss.<br />The fullness of awayness.<br />Adriftness.<br />Lostness... in a sea of sand and unfamiliarity.<br />These three well-intentioned though hapless expatriates find themselves propelled out into a very real world where romantic ideas perish, and where, if the sky is your only shelter, you may well be burnt to a crisp by the unrelenting sun.<br />Highly recommended as a reading-group selection.	2002-11-24
US	48245725	R3QZPYVSCA9N81	B00005W5V7	301192201	In pursuit of Dietrich Bonhoeffer	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Helps me to never forget April 9th, 1945.	This is, in my opinion, a faultless biography of one of the world's most controversial, and relevant theologians. The only rival to Kuhn's work is Eberhard Bethge's (1970-English) \\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer\\" (and even then, only because it is more exhaustive/detailed) but here, William Kuhns has provided readers with a more navigable journey of the life that was Bonhoeffer's, from Breslau birth to Flossenburg martyrdom.<br />No matter if you've read only two or three, (or all) of Bonhoeffer's books, this one is the perfect companion/commentary.<br />It is unique in that it is the first study by a Catholic of Bonhoeffer's daring concepts, and as such, it draws its understanding largely from Bonhoeffer's ecclesiology. There is an excellent exploration of B.'s seemingly paradoxical ideas concerning the non-religious interpretation of biblical concepts: ie., \\"religionless Christianity;\\" \\"holy worldliness;\\" \\"the powerlessness of God in the world;\\" \\"Christian atheism\\" etc. Bonhoeffer believed firmly in the proclamation of a renewed language drawn from the secular world... that \\"the time when men could be told everything by means of words, whether theological or simply pious, is over.\\"<br />How much MORE true this is for our present times!<br />Bonhoeffer's ideas were so far ahead of their time that the Church (catholic, in the universal sense) is still trying to understand and appropriate them. For Bonhoeffer, there were only two important questions: \\"What is Christianity?\\" and \\"What is Christ for us today?\\"<br />And Kuhn's book is a brilliant, well-written look at how Bonhoeffer approached these questions with not only his intellect, but with his life's blood.<br />It is the harrowing story of how this man who opposed Hitler at the outset eventually fell victim  to his conviction that there is no possibility of compromise between Christianity as it should be practiced and the evils of Nazism. Read it.	2002-11-17

I must admit, I was initially drawn to this book because I myself derive from 100% Ukrainian lineage. As such, Zabytko's subject matter interested me. I thumbed through the book and thought \\"Hey, I've gotta read this.\\"<br />The story centers around the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 26th, 1986. The fallout from this tragedy is said to have been the equivalent of eight Hiroshimas! Yet, as though the tragedy in itself were not bad enough, the government at that time chose to suppress information to the residents of villages surrounding Chernobyl, and to the nation at large. Folks were kept in the dark concerning the actual extent (and far-reaching effects) of the radioactive contamination. As a result, much PREVENTABLE damage was done to people at the time, and even to the children that would be born to those who survived.<br />The Unwashed Sky focuses on the situation facing the widow Marusia Petrenko, her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. By the time they flee their village of Starylis, it is too late. Their lives will never be the same.<br />Marusia decides to return to Starylis. She is not even aware that it has been declared a \\"forbidden zone\\"... all that she knows is that this is her village, the only home she's ever known, and since everything dear has been torn from her, this feeling of \\"home\\" may be the only thing she can yet embrace as her own.<br />She returns, and finds that her only companion is an old mangy cat. She keeps a perpetual fire, hoping that the smoke from her chimney will tell others of her presence. And slowly, some of her old friends do begin to trickle back. One by one, these old women (and one man), drawn by the same sense of a need to belong to their beginnings, return to rebuild their lives.<br />These tenacious Starylis \\"babysi\\" band together and draft a letter of demands that causes the Chernobyl officials to cede to their requests, and admit to certain wrongdoings, however late in the day! (Even then, they grant the women's wishes only because of how good this will look in the newspapers).<br />Zabytko paints a sensitive, touching picture of this time of loneliness and desolation, of undeserved and unwarranted hardship... a time when even the dirt rejected seed and the water tasted of metal.<br />I loved the authentic Ukrainian vernacular running through the book... I could hear my own grandmother clearly.<br />A wonderful testimony of the enduring power of the human spirit and its will to survive... a point made all the more sobering when one considers the non-fictional source of the author's inspiration.<br />In an interview with Rebecca Brown, Irene Zabytko said: \\"I hope that anyone who reads it comes away with the feeling that despite the cultural exoticisms, we're still part of one planet, and the endurance of the human spirit persists in all.\\"<br />I think she succeeds in this.es only because of how good this will look in the newspapers). <BR>Zabytko paints a sensitive, touching picture of this time of loneliness and desolation, of undeserved and unwarranted hardship... a time when even the dirt rejected seed and the water tasted of metal. <BR>I loved the authentic Ukrainian vernacular running through the book...

If this were the ONLY book you were to read about Gandhi, it would be an inadequate look at his life and work... for the obvious reason that he went on to live for a couple decades from the point where this Autobiography ends. This is like a Part 1 in which a Part 2 was never written. But, having said that, there is still an authority and an inner look in these pages that make reading it essential (in my opinion). To begin to understand such profound &quot;ideas&quot; as Gandhi had, you need to look at the personal origin of those ideas. Who better than Gandhi to explain these origins?<br />But the author seems to presuppose that the reader will have a supplementary knowledge of events. There are frequent gaps in the continuity of the story, digressions, and names crop up without prior introduction. (For instance, just when the reader thinks Gandhi and his followers are all tucked away on the Phoenix settlement, all of a sudden they are at Tolstoy Farm, with no explanation of how, why, or when they got there. Also, Gandhi begins talking about &quot;Andrews&quot; without ever introducing him to the reader. The book is replete with these type of headscratchisms). If they were included at all, gap-filling footnotes alone could easily have equalled the length of the book. The short, short chapters were a redeeming factor.<br />But Gandhi was not trying to write the world's most eloquent bio, his concern was to set forth a &quot;faithful narrative&quot; about his experiments with truth. And secondly, he wanted to encourage other seekers after truth with this glimpse into his own discoveries. He believed that man's natural propensities would not lead to &quot;truth&quot; of their own accord. He said that &quot;man is man because he is capable of, and only insofar as he exercises, self-restraint&quot; (317).<br />Say what you will about his ideas, the fact remains that Gandhi's influence (political and otherwise) was a direct result of the fact that he was a man who practised what he preached. This book lays bare the process, the almost superhuman process of the brutal honing of the conscience. His conclusion? &quot;The concupiscence of the mind cannot be rooted out except by intense self-examination, surrender to God, and lastly, grace.&quot; (329)<br />Some key terms covered in the book:<br />- satyagraha (active, non-violent resistance).<br />- moksha (salvation).<br />- ahimsa (non-hurting, non-violence).<br />- bramacharya (celibacy).<br />- aparigraha (non-possession).<br />Not exactly an out-on-the-beach-towel book, but that's O.K.<br />Save it for rainy days, for days when you want to do some serious thinking.what he preached.

This book came to me at a time when I needed a bit of a laugh, and I admit, it did lift me out of the doldrums. It's quite a funny story overall. Several times while reading it I felt that it was like watching a good sitcom, the main character Hank Devereaux Jr. manages to get himself into some really crazy predicaments (my favorite being the time he was trapped in the ceiling overlooking the meeting where his fate is being decided upon). If these, and many other similar scenes don't make the reader laugh out loud, they will at least cause a smirk or smile.<br />But the book, the STORY, I did not find all that compelling. Not very deep! (Again, like a sitcom).<br />The gist: As chair of the English department in a university, Hank is hit with budget demands that call for a 20% reduction in staff. While his colleagues are suspicious of where his allegiances lie, Hank juggles his own personal problems, which include a blocked urethra; the possibility of his own marriage falling apart; the surety of his daughter's marital problems, and the problem of living in his father's shadow of greatness.<br />But this Hank began to annoy me. He is the kind of person that never gives anyone a &quot;straight&quot; answer about anything... he keeps everyone else in his life waiting, and offending other people does not concern him whatsoever. If he could only appreciate the value of keeping friends onside!<br />The redeeming grace of this book is the superb Epilogue. I found that I liked (and understood) the Hank of the Epilogue. Its worth getting to the Epilogue.<br />Straight Man is more like ice cream than meat and potatoes. A well-written jolt of calories that makes no promises about long-term nutrition.	2002-10-19

This is undoubtedly my favorite Brian Moore novel and I have read almost all of his many many books. He is (was) such a fabulous writer, but there is something about this book that just goes beyond any of his others. And the strange thing is that &quot;Limbo&quot; it is not easy to obtain. Mine had to be purchased used. It was not a &quot;bestseller&quot; as is so often NOT synonymous with &quot;best-written&quot;! Do what you have to do to get your hands on An Answer From Limbo.<br />This is the story of Brendan Tierney, a 29 year old would-be-famous writer, presently employed at a banal magazine in New York City. He &quot;knows&quot; that there is a great novel inside of him, just waiting to get out. (Incidentally, I feel the same way about myself, maybe that's why I like this story so much). One day, an aquaintance of Brendan's achieves literary acclaim for a novel that he's written, and Brendan feels that his friend is unworthy of this success, especially as he compares this man's ability with his own. This spurs Brendan on to no limit of sacrificial endeavours to achieve his own literary goals. To free up his writing time, he ships his mother (from Ireland) into the spare bedroom to tend to the children, and his wife takes a job to support this changing bohemian lifestyle. It is not long before everyone around him begins to realize that nothing and no-one will stand in the way of his obsession, and Brendan has to consider what price he is willing to pay for his ruthlessness.<br />A poignant example of Brendan's complete deterioration is seen when, at his own mother's funeral, he can only contemplate how the scene would be felt by one of his fictional characters. He has become detached from himself... and another appropriate title for this book could be something like... &quot;What Price Greatness?&quot;<br />For all his sacrifice, does Brendan ever achieve greatness? Well, that is the most searing question! My reader-friends, this is an under-rated, under-read book that shows Brian Moore at his unparalleled greatness, and the writing and characterization is superb in every way.<br />Find it.<br />Get it.<br />Love it!ok that shows Brian Moore at his unparalleled greatness, and the writing and characterization is superb in every way.<BR>Find it.<BR>Get it.<BR>Love it!	2002-10-19

My \\"enjoyment\\" of the book is at about a three star level, but White's ability to achieve what he set out to do is worthy of five stars... so I am rounding off to four. What did he set out to do? To show the lifelong inner workings, to lay bare the soul of this particular artist, the painter Hurtle Duffield. White achieved his goal, we're left with a brilliant portrait, his depiction of the artist is itself a work of art, the work of a genius.<br />But the book is difficult, slow-moving and dark. It will not appeal to those who want a quick-paced storyline... and forget the word \\"action\\" all ye that dare to enter herein. These pages will rain on you. And, like all walking in the rain, you will have to remain fairly determined to reach your destination.<br />But the book is not without its merits. Artists are not normal. They are eccentric. Hurtle Duffield is a born artist, and as such, from childhood onwards he is not normal. He is consistently, and increasingly, eccentric. As a child, he is keenly observant... in a sense, vivisecting everything he sees and experiences. His adoption into a wealthy family allows for the opportunity to expand his horizons, to experience the world... yet even this good fortune is no panacea, it is clouded with difficulties, with dysfunction. The fertile ground for the artistic mind to germinate.<br />Hurtle (as perhaps all great artists) becomes the sort of person who influences those who come in contact with him, but is unable to influence himself. His relationships are tragic and self-destructive for everyone involved. He becomes a recluse, spending the latter portion of his life living with his equally eccentric sister, the kind of guy that neighborhood kids invent legends about!<br />In his mansion he continues to paint his masterpieces, which are internationally recognized.<br />The only way that Hurtle can REALLY communicate with the outside world is through his art, and White does a superb job of showing us how detrimental this type of obsession can be for the personal life of the artist himself.

US	48245725	RVURLKNEJERVV	0060925000	832364601	A Suitable Boy	Books	5	7	7	N	N	One flaw... it's not long enough.	If I had it my way, I would want the additional 600 pages Seth excised from his original manuscript tacked on to this pared down concrete slab we readers were left with. Needless to say, I loved this book. Loved it. And here's a few reasons why:<br />The whole story makes sense, for one thing. Seth's characters live and breathe like real people. No-one is really a superstar, or superhero... no one individual always saves the day. Almost everyone takes their turn at being admirable, vulnerable, humiliated, elated, dejected, disappointed, unsure, hypocritical, sincere, lovable, revered, loathed, snooty, exalted, and cast down. Even Lata Mehra, the girl for whom a suitable boy is being sought out, even she is not technically the undisputed protaganist in the novel... so many interesting sub-stories are at work throughout this year long adventure, that, at the end, it would be difficult to single out anyone as having the leading role. It would only be proper for them all to join hands and take a bow, our job being merely to applaud.<br />This book is a river with many tributaries. But it IS a river. There is a source, a unity, a connecting thread... it flows from a high point, yet the structure of A Suitable Boy is different from most &quot;plots&quot;. There certainly is no single &quot;bad guy&quot; or &quot;good guy&quot; to point to. Here we've got four families, each member of which has their own growing up to do... and as in real life, there is no time or place for a single plot. Yet, all of them (the Mehras, Kapoors, Khans, Chatterjis), have a profound effect on each other and great themes such as pride and humility, passion and patience, the practical vs. the romantic, power and authority... these themes emerge and keep the reader not only awake, but enthralled.<br />It's true that there is a lot of tedious (yet necessary) political stuff going on in this book. But I found that just as I was getting tired of it (or overwhelmed, or let's say it, bored) Seth moved on... just in time, for me anyways. I can sympatize though, and see how some readers would like to set a match to that Zamindari Abolition Act! Hello?<br />I must say that I found Lata's decision unpredictable and surprising, and right up until reading the very sentence I did not have a clue as to what she would decide to do, if anything at all. I accredit my surprise to the author's skill.<br />When Mrs. Mehra says to her younger son Varun at the end of the book &quot;You too will marry a girl I choose&quot; I had to laugh, and think &quot;Hey, what a great foreshadowy segue into a sequel called A Suitable Girl&quot;.<br />And if there were such a thing of equal size to this present book, I would wade right into it without hesitation. A Suitable Boy is a masterpiece, and I'm confident that any true lover of story will not only appreciate it, but find it unforgettable.. just in time, for me anyways.

US	48245725	R3Q3QYBO4MMAGS	0060652934	963630731	The Screwtape Letters	Books	5	6	6	N	N	We get to read ol' Splitfoot's mail.	In the original preface, Lewis says \\"There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.\\"<br />Lewis had what I consider, a very biblically orthodox and, if I may say, HEALTHY conception of \\"devils\\". For him, the devil was NOT an equal power opposite to God, or in any way self-existent from all eternity. The devil was, and is, a created being... originally good, but fallen. An angel, who by the abuse of free will became an enemy to God, and as a corollary, to us. As such, he is the opposite not of God but of Michael (the Archangel).<br />Anyhoo... in the summer of 1940 Lewis set out to write this book which \\"would consist of letters from an elderly retired devil who had just started work on his first 'patient'. The idea would be to give all the psychology of temptation from the other point of view.\\"<br />The result is this collection of thirty-one intercepted letters between the senior devil (Screwtape) and his nephew Wormwood who has been assigned the damnation of one man's soul.<br />It is brilliant.<br />Here we see how the everyday life of the 'patient' looks from the viewpoint of Hell... how the many daily temptations are designed to chip away at the very foundation of who he is... to lead him not toward Heaven, but away from it. What is notable is the subtle nature of the temptations... ie., to be picky about what you eat, to hop from church to church, to argue, etc., rather than (for instance) to go out and shoot your neighbor. All is \\"good\\" in Screwtape's world as long as it leads ever so gradually downwards! Throughout the course of the letters, the state of this particular patient's soul undulates as he experiences a conversion, doubt, dangerous friendships, war, love, and finally, in death, oneness with God.<br />The theology latent in this work of fiction is undeniably Christian. Those readers with even the slightest Christian sensiblilties will be further convinced that there are unseen forces presently at work in all of us, whose goal is to sap life in the here AND after! For other readers, as Anthony Burgess once said, \\"Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way.\\"<br />And, oh yes, \\"Readers are advised to remember that the devil is a liar. Not everything that Screwtape says should be assumed to be true even from his own angle.\\"<br />Remember whose mail we're reading after all!with God.<BR>The theology latent in this work of fiction is undeniably Christian.

I took it on vacation with me (to an island) and I ended up being disappointed because I had nothing else to read. But I did finish the book, and as a few other reviewers have commented, it seemed to be low on plot... and to not really get off the ground. I think that Huxley was a genius, and a wonderful writer, and so it pains me to say this about this particular book. I just think he was trying to say too much here... too much selective philosophy rammed into a novel. What do I mean by selective? Well, for one thing, it leaves no room for the possibility of a God who is separate from his creation. Theism is mocked here. A more well-rounded novel about philosophy would be Jostein Gaarder's \\"Sophie's World\\".<br />Huxley's Island is this isolated Pala, a magisterial queendom, founded on the principles of Mahayana Buddhism and western/scientific atheism. Dr. Robert, who is the grandson of one of the two founders of Pala, says, \\"The Palanese were Buddhists. They knew how misery is related to mind. You cling, you crave, you assert yourself - and you live in a homemade hell. You become detached - and you live in peace.\\" (ch.viii). The residents of Pala have developed a society based upon disciplined detachment, admirable enough in many ways. A peaceful compassionate world where even the wild mynah birds are trained to say \\"have compassion, have compassion.\\" This detachment is achieved through many methods, including hypnotism, transcendental meditation, animal magnetism, and of course, the ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms (called \\"moksha-medicine\\"). Living in the \\"here and now\\" is of paramount importance, in fact, it could be said that this is the worldview of Pala. \\"Matter is evil\\" is a big idea too.<br />Will Farnaby (an outsider) is deliberately shipwrecked on this tropical would-be utopia and seeks to influence the Queen or \\"Rani\\" regarding the lucrative oil rights to Pala. But Mr. Farnaby becomes integrated into the life of the island, and is experientially impressed to the point of second-guessing some of his own motives and ambitions. What seemed to be opportunity now looks like exploitation. But it may be too late for anyone (including Huxley) to do anything, one way or the other, about the inexorable conclusion.<br />At any rate, the ending seemed sort of weak. Somewhere I remember reading that Huxley was pressured to finish the book quicker than he would have liked. If so, that is unfortunate. Have you ever watched one of those movies where at the end the screen goes black, and you're expecting a bit more but the credits start rolling by, and you turn to whoever is next to you and say \\"What?\\" Well, that's how I felt, out in the paddle-boat when I finished this book.<br />Everyone knows that Huxley was tremendously interested in the hallucinogenic experience. I agree with him that hallucinogens can grant a momentary heightened awareness, maybe even make someone feel that they are thereby tapping in to some kind of mystical Oneness. Whoop-de-do! But the benefit of such experience will always break down when applied to society. The benefits, if any, will always be individual, and individually experienced. Let's face it, for utopia to be sustainable at all, a certain amount of society has to be brutally sober. For instance, there's nothing \\"utopic\\" or peaceful about taking off in a jet when the pilot is up front burping mushrooms and \\"tuning in to his Oneness\\".<br />Pala doesn't work for me, because it's too simplistic. I'm rounding off 2.5 stars upwards, out of respect for the author in general.Farnaby becomes integrated into the life of the island, and is experientially impressed to the point of second-guessing some of his own motives and ambitions.

If you share my opinion that Tolstoy was far and away the greatest writer of all time (in ANY language), well, then you will undoubtedly benefit from this book by Patricia Chute. It is so well done, the author carried out extensive research at the Tolstoy State Museum, personally visited Yasnaya Polyana twice, and interviewed Tolstoy's grandaughter Mme. Vera Tolstoy, just to mention a few of her modes of inquiry. The result is this wonderful panoramic survey that reads like a novel and is not intimidating in size. In fact, for those who do not have the time to get through Henri Troyat's superb \\"three-course-meal\\" biography of Tolstoy, I recommend this book by Chute as the perfect alternative. Perfect. Bite-size in comparison.<br />I am very impressed with the photographs (both in amount and selection) that find their way into this book. I've read so many books about Leo Tolstoy but have never seen even half of the photos that can be seen here.<br />This book will not disappoint. Let this Table Of Contents whet your appetite:<br />1. A Splendid Orphan and the Golden Age of Yasnaya Polyana (1828-1852)<br />2. Soldier, Teacher, and a Terrifying Happiness (1852-1862)<br />3. War and Peace (1862-1869)<br />4. Anna Karenina and A Confession (1869-1880)<br />5. A Soul Divided (1880-1890)<br />6. A Taste For Public Action (1890-1901)<br />7.

My usual reaction to reading anything that Lewis committed to paper is something like... \\"Now there's something worth remembering for the rest of my life.\\" His poems are no exception.<br />This compilation is superb in that it spans all of the short verse that Lewis wrote from the age of sixteen until his death at age sixty-five.<br />He was profoundly disillusioned with the direction of the \\"modern\\" poetry of his day. He lamented the incoherence and lack of structure that was taking place (his poem \\"A Confession\\" addresses these feelings), and he greatly favored a return to a metrically disciplined, rhyming style.<br />That's what we get here in Lewis's Poems. Over one hundred lightning flashes bursting with intelligent layers of meaning, yet remaining accessible to the average reader. These poems are healthy, they embrace life, they respect death, they exalt nature, they are wide-eyed at night and squinting at the brilliance of noonday. Using subject matter as diverse as salamanders to meteorites, these poems impart truth because they come from the mind of someone who believed in objective truth. As he said, \\"Great subjects do not make great poems; usually, indeed, the reverse.\\"<br />And elsewhere \\"'Look in thy heart and write' is good counsel for poets; but when a poet looks in his heart he finds many things there besides the actual. That is why, and how, he is a poet.\\"<br />If I started listing my personal favorites I'd exceed amazon's 1,000 word limit! Suffice it to say that perhaps the greatest thing about Lewis's Poems is that once you've read them you're left with a sense that the author thinks highly of the reader!<br />\\"It seems to me appropriate, almost inevitable, that when that great Imagination which in the beginning, for Its own delight and for the delight of men and angels and (in their proper mode) of beasts, had invented and formed the whole world of Nature, submitted to express Itself in human speech, that speech should sometimes be poetry. For poetry too is a little incarnation, giving body to what had been before invisible and inaudible.\\"<br /> - from Lewis's \\"Reflections On The Psalms\\" -<br />What makes Lewis so great?<br />Well, for starters... he thinks that words like Imagination, Nature, and Itself, are proper nouns that deserve capitals!s Itself in human speech, that speech should sometimes be poetry.

What will the verdict be? Things can go either way right up until the jury foreman tells us, and that is part of what makes this novel so great. The Courtroom drama is excellent, and Uris does a fine job of showing us how expert legal cross-examination during the course of a trial can turn a Plaintiff into a Defendent. It's superb stuff. He keeps us guessing and re-guessing.<br />The issue at stake here in QBVII cannot be over-estimated. A doctor is being tried in order to establish whether he can be held accountable for atrocious operations he performed while he was himself a prisoner of Jadwiga Concentration Camp. Did Dr. Kelno purposely mutilate and torture the Jews that were brought to him? If so, was this intentional? What were his options? Is he, in fact, an Anti-Semite? Were his actions based on racial hatred/prejudice?<br />Wow, I was completely taken up with this book and fascinated with its sobering subject matter. I was page-flipping long into the night... the whole \\"Oh-just-one-more-chapter-just-one-more-chapter\\" thing.<br />At one point the narrator says \\"There is in us all that line that prevents us from fully understanding those who are different.\\" This is so true, and this book makes each reader ask themself... \\"In a similar situation, what would I have done?\\"<br />Great characterization and suspense from a superb author.	2002-07-15

Hilarious and Informative. And Bryson wastes no time at getting to the hilarious stuff. A few pages into the first chapter he describes how he went into a jet-lag induced coma during a sightseeing tour of Sydney. I was reading this in a public place and laughed for about five minutes without breathing... seriously, tears and all! It was very therapeutic for me. Every few pages he again says something undeniably witty, and this makes the book a joy to read. I loved every minute of it.<br />On the informative side, I felt that the book covered as much of &quot;habitable&quot; Australia as possible. It seems very thorough, I followed along with an actual travel guide, cross-referencing and reading further about every site that Bryson mentioned here. I was not aware of the incredible vastness of this country, it's almost unbelievable. 23,000 miles of coastline! Having driven the length and breadth of Canada many times (always with an eye to the odometer), I tried to gauge what is comparably going on here in the Sunburned Country... wow, Australia is crazy man! Keep a gas can and canteen handy if you're driving through...<br />And secondly, I was not aware of the political history of this land and the diversity of living creatures (including trees) that call Australia home. Now I know. Bryson's book is not only a personal travelogue, but it's also a regurgitation (maybe that word is a bit too vomit-like, but you know what I mean) of a lot of obvious research and study on his part.<br />Bryson is the intrepid wanderer. He is always more curious, and walking a bit further into things than anyone else. And at times, he's so well-researched that he helps out the tour-guides! He demonstrates a respect for the country and for the living things there (including the people). Towards the end of the journey, he is on one of his rambling jaunts, this time in King's Park in Perth. There in front of him, an echidna ambles across the path, and just as quietly disappears into the undergrowth. Bryson says, &quot;I couldn't have been more thrilled.&quot; This is the spirit with which he travels, and writes. He is ever ready for amazement, and I know his interest in the natural beauty of things is infectious, because I caught it! About the echidna incident, he says &quot;In a country filled with exotic and striking life-forms my high point was finding a harmless, animated pincushion in a city park.&quot; This attitude is consistent with what he considers one of Australia's &quot;most amazing wonders of all&quot;... the living prehistoric stromatolite beds at Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast. These aquatic growths are virtually unchanged from how they existed 3.5 billion years ago.

For an author, there are two factors which greatly complicate a modern examination of the German resistance to Hitler. Firstly, after the failure of the assassination attempt on July 20th 1944, the Gestapo and the SS launched operation Thunderstorm, which eliminated thousands of Germans who were under suspicion (however slight) of disloyalty to the regime. Of course, irreplacable information perished along with these individuals. Secondly, now that half a century has passed, natural mortality has thinned even further the ranks of those who survived the War. Anton Gill has overcome these obstacles by locating and interviewing that handful of living participants, and by interviewing relatives and friends of those who died. This exceptional research, his grasp of European history, and his exceptional ability to tell the story combine to result in this flawless chronicle of an era.<br />Let's face it, reading war history can be about as exciting as eating a bag of sawdust. But this book reads like a novel, truly it does. It is never boring. It is a book about heroes, those who risked and lost their lives in an effort to thwart the plans of someone that history has confirmed as a madman. Why are they heroes? Among other reasons, because they had the perception to recognize Hitler as such AT THE TIME. It is easy to look back at this era and think of \\"what I would have done\\" but Gill's book shows us how truly difficult it was to be the one who resisted. For instance, it is certain that at no time could the conspirators, at whatever level they were working, count on the support of the populace or any form of legal recourse. Their lives were on the line. No turning back. But we who have never lived in a police state, who can criticise our government in letters to the newspaper or on an open postcard to a friend, who can speak our minds freely on the telephone or on the computer, can have no idea of what it is like to work against a regime whose hold on power depends on fear and informers, on mistrust and deception, on children reporting parents and parents denouncing children. This book is the story of those who resisted, at a time when the penalty for writing \\"Down With Hitler\\" on a wall was nothing less than death! We can't imagine.<br />Heroes like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Sophie Scholl, General Hans Oster, Ludwig Beck... you will hope against hope for these and so many others, while at the same time realizing that we can re-read history, but we can't rewrite it.<br />The story of Claus Graf Schenck von Stauffenberg's failed assassination attempt on Hitler at the Wolfsschanze, this was the most exciting part of the book. Gill's explanation of the events makes the heart pound, and you can follow along with the excellent maps that are provided. The resolve, the fortitude, the determination of Stauffenberg is literally amazing.

And I've settled on a term I would use to summarize what McEwan does with his writing. He makes us consider antecedent causes. Makes you think about &quot;what went before.&quot; This happened because of this, that happened because of that, and so on. It all fits so tightly in retrospect. Results or consequences escalate in a measure that seems impossible to predict. All good authors do this to some extent, I mean, that's what &quot;plot&quot; is all about... but McEwan could teach others to do it better!<br /> With Black Dogs it is the incident with the vicious dogs on the path. With Amsterdam a lot of the consequences have to do with the seemingly innocuous pact made between the two men.<br /> Here in Enduring Love, this ballooning accident sets in motion events that no-one (especially Joe or his wife Clarissa)would have ever been able to predict. In a MILLION years. This is truly a brilliant book about fanatical obsession and the insidious way that a loving relationship can be infiltrated and ruined by forces from outside of that relationship. This happened in a more roundabout way in the other two books I've mentioned, but here in Enduring Love it's right up front. Wow, it's just an amazing book. I unreservedly recommend Enduring Love to anyone who likes a good psychological thriller... something you just can't put down for too long.<br />And thanks to McEwan's book, if I'm ever part of an impromptu hot-air balloon rescue crew, I will be sure to NOT smile at any of my team members!	2002-06-30

We all have character flaws, it is an unavoidable fact. We all have idiosyncracies that hinder us at times, and sometimes downright debilitate us! Not only do these flaws make our own lives disappointing, but they make those around us wish that we were not around them! Dr. Tartaglia shows us that these flaws tend to travel in clusters. They spin out of control and perpetuate themselves... &quot;You only need to get one flaw going and the others automatically join. When they are all working in combination you are out of control. When they are out of YOUR control, your life becomes unmanageable.&quot;<br />The &quot;flaws&quot; he examines in this book are very... commonplace. If you honestly ask yourself the 19 questions he places at the beginning of each chapter (why 19? I don't know), you will SURELY find yourself saying &quot;Wow, hey, I do that all the time!&quot; Or, conversely, you will say, &quot;No, I have a lot of problems, but this is not one of them.&quot; Make a list. Take notes. It's terribly interesting what you find out about yourself as you read this book. And it's so educationally beneficial and satisfying to place other people in those places that don't apply to you. &quot;Oh, I know someone that is SO EXACTLY LIKE THAT!&quot; etc. etc. You can photocopy those chapters and send anonymous letters!<br />The chapters conclude with good practical pointers on how to overcome flawed behaviour patterns. The author is witty and has definitely been around the block a few times in his observations about human behaviour. Flawless did not strike me as being notably PROFOUND though... it was just a lot of well-organized common sense, and toward the end it was starting to bore me. But it is always good to be reminded of the importance of common sense, and this book is worth the time.	2002-06-23

The Seven Last Words are not seven &quot;words&quot; but seven &quot;utterances&quot; and they are these:<br />&quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot;<br />&quot;Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.&quot;<br />&quot;Woman, behold your son. Son, behold your mother.&quot;<br />&quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;<br />&quot;I thirst.&quot;<br />&quot;It is finished.&quot;<br />&quot;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.&quot;<br />These are the seven biblically recorded utterances of Christ on the cross, and Neuhaus has written, in my opinion, the superlative meditation of the significance of these final words of Jesus. Each chapter expounds upon one of these &quot;words&quot;. The writing is so clear-headed... it will appeal to those who need to approach the ineffable mystery with at least one foot on the ground. Or even two! It is not spiritual platitude, it is gut-level and sobering. Have you ever wondered what happened when Jesus died on the cross? Or WHY it happened? Or IF it happened? This book speaks to those questions, with a rational approach that can only be likened to the writings of C.S. Lewis.<br />I was transfixed, and overwhelmed (in a good way) with the wealth of information in Neuhaus's book. Beautifully written.<br />He says in the preface, &quot;If what Christians say about Good Friday is true, then it is, quite simply, the truth about everything. I have written this for people who are convinced of that truth, for people who are open to thinking about whether it may be true and for people who are just curious about why so much of the world thinks Good Friday is the key to understanding what Dante called 'the love that moves the sun and all the other stars.'&quot;<br />The Convinced. The Cautious. The Curious. If you are any of these three types, this book will not disappoint you.<br />&quot;We must not turn away from what we have done to God, lest we be found to have turned away from what He has done for us.&quot; (p.257).e for us.&quot; (p.257).	2002-06-17

When an author wins the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Committee composes a blurb summarizing that author's contribution to the world of literature. For Jose Saramago, they said: \\"who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality\\".<br />After reading Blindness, my opinion is that the statement does reflect what Saramago is doing (in this case, at least). He took a very difficult subject (inexplicable sudden blindness) and caused the reader to \\"apprehend\\" what would happen if such a situation became reality. I found the entire story to be extremely disturbing, but very believable on many levels. Very detailed, realistic.<br />Whatever causes this \\"white blindness\\" is definitely the most contagious thing to ever sweep the earth. Apparently, just from seeing the infected person... WHAMMO you've got it too! This didn't bother me as a reader, maybe some people find it just a bit too... bizarre? I think Saramago's inventiveness with this whole particular blindness theme was brilliant. Not since reading Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" was I so convinced that it was the end of the world.<br />Along with whether or not you can adjust yourself to its literary composition (which is by no means orthodox or ordinary) I think a reader's opinion of the following two statements would greatly determine their opinion of Blindness as a STORY.<br />1) Man is a fallen (base) creature, with a natural bias to do evil.<br />2) Men are good by nature, and made bad by society.<br />To me, it is obvious that there is truth-value to both statements. But I believe that the first statement is MORE true... truer in more instances. Those who would feel the same about that issue would enjoy Blindness more than those who favor the latter statement. Because, in this book, there are few heroes... the majority of mankind when the chips are down... look pretty grim. Things are quite dark in here. To those with a generally cheery disposition and optimistic outlook on humanity in general, this book makes a very unwise gift.<br />I \\"see\\" it as a four and a half star work of art.ptimistic outlook on humanity in general, this book makes a very unwise gift.<BR>I \\"see\\" it as a four and a half star work of art.	2002-06-11

That's exactly what it is... connected vignettes. Observations of the lives that make up Miguel Street, a street in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It is all set down and seen through the eyes of a young, fatherless boy.<br />It is written with such a clear eye that it seems autobiographical, and here on Miguel Street we see the germ or the kernel of many of the characters that Naipaul would develop further in his excellent book \\"A House For Mr. Biswas\\" which he published two years after this one.<br />As others have mentioned, the language, the idioms, the vernacular here are priceless... 1940's Trinidad bursts into view.<br />I give it 4.5 stars.

US	48245725	RX7N18JVJNUGH	9992642416	561792824	The Place of the Lion	Books	3	75	81	N	N	&quot;Difficult&quot; with a capital D.	This is the fourth Williams book I have read. For me, it's been the most difficult to understand, so far. One needs to be schooled (and schooled fairly thoroughly) in philosophy to fully appreciate what is going on here in The Place Of The Lion.<br />I am not, and don't.<br />A reader of this book also needs to know a bit about Williams himself. As a neo-Platonist he did not see God acting alone to create the universe, but as the creator also of sub-creators, which are traditionally known as the angelic hierarchies. For Williams, these were ever-present realities, ruling not only the great principles of creation, but also having the ability to burst in and effect the lives and destinies of men, whether on a group or individual basis. Here in The Place Of The Lion these universal powers are inadvertently stumbled upon by a Platonic meditation group led by a Mr. Berringer. Now, according to Platonic theory, behind the visible world lies the invisible world of Ideas. That is, behind every chair we observe, whether it is a King's throne or a leprechaun's toadstool, lies the Idea of &quot;chairness&quot;. There is, so to speak, an eternal Chair from which all chairs proceed. This applies to everything in our world; a table is an instance of the Idea of tables, or of the Table; a man and a woman are cases in point of Maleness and Femaleness. In other words, if there is anything that may be called &quot;unreal&quot; says the Platonist, it is this transitory world of mere appearances which we live in.<br />The picture which Williams chose for The Place Of The Lion is this Platonic one. It so happens that on one occasion, Mr. Berringer's meditation is deep enough to cause a rupture in the divide between the outer and inner worlds. He is out walking in a condition almost of trance, deep in meditation upon the Platonic idea of strength and kingship, using the archetypal image of a lion. In this state, it so happens that his path is crossed by a real lioness which has escaped from a local circus or zoo. The animal attacks him but the remarkable result is that the lioness vanishes into thin air, and Berringer falls into a cataleptic trance, while the mighty figure of a maned lion is seen walking away - the very archetypal image on which he had been meditating.<br />Bizarre huh? It's only beginning. He now lies in a coma, and his home and the surrounding area become the place of severe archetypal activity. At one point, the archetypal enormous butterfly appears and all the normal butterflys of the world fly back into it. Totally wild.<br />I cannot begin to scratch the surface of all the very strange happenings that take place in the book, but I think overall it is meaning to say that man ought to be able to rule all of these forces. There is one man in the book that does, and the story ends with him as a second Adam &quot;naming the beasts&quot; and establishing dominion over them.<br />To &quot;get it&quot; and maintain interest in this book a reader should have a pre-familiarity with Platonic theory.

If this book were a movie, the first scene might carry the caption June 1934, and the camera would pan across the vast unfinished Vimy Memorial being built near Arras in France. Workers would be chipping away at the imposing base of the structure, painstakingly carving into the white stone the name of one of the more than 11,000 soldiers whose final resting place was unknown... other workers would be on scaffolding or suspended from ropes, five stories high, chiselling statues from the massive pillars as the wind whistles by them.<br />Then the scene would shift, perhaps the camera itself passes through a cloud, and emerges in the small village of Inzell, Bavaria... and the caption now reads May, 1866. A contented young priest is silently praying to the Creator of all the beauty that surrounds him. Suddenly, as he is distracted by a rare wildflower, he believes he hears the voice of God giving him a very clear directive \\"Go to Canada. There is much work for you to do there.\\"<br />My imagination is aided by the fact that this is (almost) exactly how Jane Urquhart begins her book. She reaches back a half century to set up the background for the main timeframe of the novel, which will be the few years just prior to the outbreak of World War I and the 15-20 years following the end of the War. The above mentioned priest (Father Gstir) reluctantly obeyed God's instructions and came to the wild frontier of Upper Canada, where he successfully founded the village of Shoneval, Ontario. Here, he serendipitously meets the son of a Bavarian miller, Joseph Becker, a wood-carver by trade. Father Gstir commissions Joseph to build a church and adorn it with his carvings.<br />The scene changes yet again, and a generation has passed. The rest of the book, now focuses on Joseph's grand-daughter... the \\"geist-ridden\\" spinster Klara Becker. We now see Klara growing up in a relatively peaceful family that does end up having its slightly dysfunctional moments. Grandfather Joseph has his heart set on Klara's younger brother Tilman, hoping that he can make a true carver of the boy. As it turns out, Tilman is an extremely claustrophobic child whose almost daily tendency is to run away from home. It is Klara who is more interested in carrying on the carving tradition and she has obvious skill with the chisel on wood. She inherits Joseph's perfectionism or \\"a need for order\\" and creates beautiful works. Klara's parents make a terrible decision one day with regard to confining the boy Tilman, and with the help of Klara, he escapes and seems to run away this time for MAYBE what looks like forever. Meanwhile, Klara experiences her first taste of love with a neighbouring lad by the name of Eamon O'Sullivan, but when war breaks out... (I won't say what happens). During the war years, Klara begins to shut down inside... just as her soul was beginning to spread itself out, it seems to her that it had been unjustly shot down. Her long blonde hair is now in a knot, and she takes on the role of spinster. Meanwhile Klara's parents pass away, and Tilman is out having adventures all of his own, landing a job and his first sense of permanence in the industrial city of Hamilton. Tilman the soldier is himself \\"wounded out\\" of the War, and over a decade passes before he hobbles back to visit his sister. This wonderful latter half of the book (appropriately entitled \\"The Monument\\") is all about the rebirth of dreams, the following of convictions, the importance of believing in a cause... the beauty of using our creative energy to honor others. It is clear at the end of the book that it is never too late for us to taste and drink of the joys of living. Brother and sister end up across the Atlantic, at the very plot of ground that represents the greatest loss of each of their lives... and both receive an individual healing in a way that neither could have ever imagined for themselves. At a recent reading I attended, the author was asked what this book was about. She replied, \\"It is about the redemptive nature of art.\\"<br />Perhaps it would be fitting in the last scene of the movie of this book if the camera panned across the completed monument, now clear of all human presence... the camera again passes through a cloud, only this time it does not ever emerge at all... and the narrator says \\"And so the impossible happens as a result of whims that turn into obsessions.\\" And again, my imagination is indebted to the author who put this sentence on the last page of her book.is about the redemptive nature of art.\\"<BR>Perhaps it would be fitting in the last scene of the movie of this book if the camera panned across the completed monument, now clear of all human presence... the camera again passes through a cloud, only this time it does not ever emerge at all... and the narrator says \\"And so the impossible happens as a result of whims that turn into obsessions.\\" And again, my imagination is indebted to the author who put this sentence on the last page of her book.	2002-05-12

From her very earliest years she has a profound awareness of the mystery of life, nothing is without wonder, everything worthy of further scientific investigation. She HAS (she POSESSES) what Abraham Maslow called a &quot;freshness of appreciation&quot; meaning not only that nothing escapes her notice, but also that she tends to find some positive result out of all of her experiences. I find this to be an enviable trait.<br />The book, her childhood, takes place in Pittsburgh in the 1950's. She is afforded much freedom and affluence in her somewhat eccentric and hilarious family (her mother didn't like the taste of stamps, so she didn't lick stamps; she licked the corner of the envelope instead). Dillard wonderfully paints a picture of a world that is charged with wonder, and gives us a sense that this electrified world is not just hers, but also the world of the reader.<br />Her writing is best when describing her great love of nature. I could swear I HEARD the following sentence... &quot;The waves disintegrated on the big beach; from the high cliff where our house stood, their breaking sounded like poured raw rice.&quot;<br />It's true that one has to be patient with Dillard's disconnected vignettes... there are diversions that seem to bust up the chronology of events, but overall, the book is great in that it makes the reader feel that perhaps they too have never lived an insignificant day.<br />She says: &quot;...it is not you or I that is important, neither what sort we might be nor how we came to be each where we are. What is important is anyone's coming awake and discovering a place, finding in full orbit a spinning globe one can lean over, catch, and jump on. What is important is the moment of opening a life and feeling it touch - with an electric hiss and cry - this speckled mineral sphere, our present world.&quot;<br />She seems to be saying that there is a glory in the mundane.	2002-05-06

From the first line \\"The Mole sat toasting his toes in front of the fire\\" I was glad to be once again in the presence of these unforgettable Edwardian animal bachelors. In my estimation, Horwood has done a superb job of capturing again the spirit of the River Bank.<br />Apparently, he was inspired after acquiring in 1992, several of E.H. Shepard's original illustrations for Grahame's 1908 classic, The Wind In The Willows. Observing them in his study, they began to take on a life of their own... and then \\"One day, quite unexpectedly (though the drawing had not changed at all), it seemed to me that Mole was off on a journey rather different than his original one. True, he had set off from the same comfortable home he loved so much, but now he was no longer heading towards the comfort and safety of Badger's house, but instead towards the River - the frozen River - and towards disaster. The story of The Willows In Winter had begun.\\"<br />This is a great book that will appeal to young and old alike. It's full of the perils and consequences of misadventure, the peace and calm of friendly reunion and the importance of forgiveness. Oh ya, and a hilariously inebriated Toad!<br />I find it funny that Horwood is sometimes criticized for keeping the characters so similar to what they were in the original story. Isn't that what a good sequel does? Keeps things consistent, but brings them further along the road?	2002-04-27

This is the great lay-theologian's foray into sci-fi, first published in 1938. I mention that date, because this book does not resemble much current \\"science fiction.\\" It's definitely fiction... but not very scientific. For instance, Lewis avoids explaining any technical problems in how these characters actually leave Earth's atmosphere (or return). What is the source of propulsion? Nowadays, a 7-year-old reader would get bogged down in the first few pages, realizing that everyone would be burnt to a crisp in the homemade space-contraption Lewis blithely hurtles them off in.<br />That being said... the book is still a gem.<br />It begins with Dr. Elwin Ransom (a middle-aged Philologist from Cambridge University) being kidnapped by two men, Dick Devine and Dr. Weston, the latter being a mad physicist who wants to extend humanity to other planets. At first, Ransom is excited with this journey to Malacandra (Mars)... until he overhears that he is going to be offered as a sacrifice to the space-creatures called \\"sorns.\\" Devine and Weston have been to Malacandra before, and have convinced themselves that a human sacrifice is recquired by the sorns, in return for the right to exploit the planet's gold deposits.<br />Upon arrival, Ransom escapes... beginning a conflict that lasts the length of the book and extends to its sequel \\"Perelandra.\\"<br />In this colorful novel, Lewis explores many DEEP themes... the primary one being that, if there is life on another planet, there is no need for us to assume that it is in a \\"fallen\\" state, or filled with wickedness, or in need of redemption, as our own is. If we reached other planets we might find a race which was, like us, rational but, unlike us, innocent - having no wars nor any other wickedness among them. If this were so, we would have much to learn from such creatures, and have nothing to teach them. But, because of our own \\"bentness\\" we would probably find some reason for exterminating them.<br />This is what happens here in Out Of The Silent Planet.<br />Lewis was inspired to write this book after finding that many of his own students held to beliefs in interplanetary colonization and the scientific hope of defeating physical death. Out Of The Silent Planet is an attack on the belief that the supreme moral end of mankind is the perpetuation of our own species. The book is so rich in invention, so broad in scope, so sensuously perceptive in descriptive detail that, after reading it, it's difficult to view the Cosmos through any but Lewis' eyes.

It just so happens that I've finished reading this book today, exactly 85 years after the very battle it describes. The Battle of Vimy Ridge, April 9th, 1917.<br />On that chilly morning the inexperienced Canadian Corps (including one British brigade) were expected to accomplish what the British and French had failed to do in two years: namely, to dislodge the Germans from their impenetrable stronghold of Vimy Ridge on the Douai Plains of France. And they were expected to achieve that victory with fifty thousand fewer men then the French had LOST in their own frustrated assaults.<br />They did it.<br />And this book is their story.<br />Pierre Berton's approach is unique, and makes for a breathtaking read.  In the Author's Note he says \\"My purpose... has been to tell not just what happened but also WHAT IT WAS LIKE. I have tried to look at the Vimy experience from the point of view of the man in the mud as well as from that of the senior planners.\\"<br />He has achieved his goal... one gets the sense that the author ran through the trenches and across \\"No Man's Land\\" himself with a videocamera on that thunderous morning. Not only do we see the root and stem of every tactical achievement and blunder, we hear, see and smell, and FEEL what took place as well, in as much as it is possible. The research is extensive and meticulous, as can be seen in the Acknowledgements and Source List at the end of the book.<br />It just so happens that I live within sight of the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill, here in the capital city of Canada. High up in that Tower the single word \\"Vimy\\" is carved. For me, reading this book shifts a tremendous load of significance onto that single word.<br />Vimy stands for more than a battle won, it stands for Canadian ingenuity, innovation, courage, Canadian dash and daring, Canadian enterprise. Life! Freedom!<br />It has become commonplace to say that Canada came of age at Vimy Ridge.<br />This is an immeasurably important, beautifully written book. Read Vimy, \\"lest we forget.\\"\\"lest we forget.\\"	2002-04-09

This story takes place over a three-year period during the Depression era, in a small fictitious town in the Southern U.S., ripe with racial prejudice. We view things through the 8 to 11 year-old eyes of the young girl Scout Finch. After the death of their mother, Scout and her older brother Jem are raised by Atticus, their almost too perfect father. (He often reminded me of Adam Trask in Steinbeck's East of Eden). You could not ask for a better, more patient, and more understanding father than Atticus. As the town's defense lawyer he takes up the case of Tom Robinson, a Negro unjustly accused of raping a white woman.<br />The resulting courtroom drama shakes the previously idyllic world of his two children, especially Scout. The children raise many legal and moral questions for Atticus, and he compells them to come to their own conclusions about the case.<br />What is brilliant about the book is how these children have a precocious understanding of justice... their very innocence and unbiased judgement points out the true horror of racial prejudice. Sitting in the courtroom, they are able to clearly understand the TRUTH that seems to elude an entire jury of adults.<br />Much more can be said in praise of this book, as there are many side-stories going on at the same time as this court case is proceeding. The timeless wonder of it all is how Harper Lee dovetails all of the other incidents to leave us with a sense of the ennobling nature of childhood. Sometimes children can look upon the effects of injustice and have their own sense of \\"justice\\" strengthened, rather than diminished. It takes great empathy and inner spirit to acheive this, but, To Kill A Mockingbird shows us that it is possible.	2002-04-06

Amsterdam is not a masterpiece, nor what I perceive to be the crowning glory of Ian McEwan, but it is a fine novel... well worth the time spent in its pages. Who else can say so much, while using so little tree bark?<BR>McEwan's skill is best seen in his ruthless dissection of character, and in this book, he stretches two guys out like laboratory frogs. We see their guts, (the inner workings), and follow the disintegration of a lifelong friendship... Like the hissing of live grenades, there is a brooding that lurks in his pages...yet McEwan keeps it all closer to being light and comical than heavy and morbid.<BR>The amazon editorial review (above) gives a great synopsis of the book. I will add only that the story addresses the way that vocational (professional) ambition can supercede and radically displace the naked commitment of friendship. The dustjacket of my hardcover version depicts a duel taking place in a forested area. Does a duel take place in the book? No. But, suffice it to say... the dustjacket is appropriate in a way that will not be understood until the very final pages. And you will want to get to those pages.<BR>This is the perfect book to take along with you when you know you will have 4 or 5 hours of non-interrupted reading time... (train, plane, bus, coffee-shop). If you can't find time to read McEwan, I must say to you, \\"Wow, are you ever busy!\\"	2002-03-17

I am a Christian and I really enjoy watching The Simpsons. There are millions of others who can say the same, but there are just as many who would find my confession to be self-contradictory or maybe even sacrilegious. And most viewers probably have no opinion, one way or the other, about the Simpsons moral agenda. But no matter who you are, you will be enlightened by this book about the \\"good news\\" according to the Simpsons.<br />Love it or hate it, the fact is that The Simpsons is definitely one of the most theologically relevant programs in prime time today. Pinsky points out that the unique thing about the show is that it does not shy away from exposing the religious underpinnings or \\"convictions\\" of its characters. Each chapter of his book focuses on a different theme or character, and surveys how they react to their many moral dilemnas. How is that theme presented by the show's writers? It's very interesting. Most of us know that the Bible asks, \\"What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\\" Well, then there's Homer, who says in one episode \\"I'd sell my soul for a donut.\\" What are we to make of this guy? Or Bart, for that matter? A lot of people turn the show off or avoid it entirely because of the irreligious worldview of these (and other) characters. But Pinsky shows us that the writers do not leave anyone in a favorable light until the moral dilemnas are resolved, usually in a way that is consistent with values we would all like to emulate. In other words, the show does not glorify sloth, irresponsibility, laziness, disobedience, gluttony, hypocrisy, or all-around \\"sin\\" as much as it appears to on the surface. There actually IS some \\"good news\\" to be found in The Simpsons.<br />Pinsky proves this with a simple question at one point. He asks, \\"Who would you rather have as a neighbor? Homer or Ned Flanders?\\"<br />Exactly!	2002-03-04

After cranking out a string of pot-boiler thrillers, Judith Hearne was Moore's debut venture into the world of the serious novel. Here he sought to depict the epic, cosmic conflicts that are under the surface of the most seemingly ordinary of lives. He set it squarely in 1950's Belfast, where he was raised as one of the Catholic minority. He hated Belfast, calling it a \\"claustrophobic, provincial backwater... trapped in the nightmare of history\\" and plagued equally with Protestant self-righteousness and Catholic repressiveness. All of these sentiments find their way into this, his first literary novel.<br />Judith, convent-raised, unmarried, and forty-something moves into Mrs. Rice's boarding house on Camden Street. It is her sixth relocation in the last few years. We find out WHY later. She teaches piano and embroidery to an ever diminishing handful of students, has very few possessions, and fewer social attachments. In fact, her only social involvement is tea with the O'Neill family on Sunday afternoons. Only later do we find how one-sided even this relationship is. The O'Neills secretly dread her visits.<br />We are soon to sense the brooding cloud of narrowness, plainness, loneliness, and ignorance that hovers over this poor soul. Moore captures it. Even her physical frame, he says, is \\"plain as a cheap clothes rack.\\"<br />To sustain herself she lives in a world of religious faith and imagination... or illusion. She daydreams, and surrounds herself with iconic totems from her uneventful past. And she has a secret vice that isn't revealed until almost midway in the novel. She's a(n) _____! (I won't say).<br />The novel revolves around Judith's interactions with the many other residents of Mrs. Rice's home. Because of Judith's long repressed desires and vivid imagination, she is quick to assume that Mr. Madden's attentions will lead to a splendid marriage. But in their mutually illusive worlds they are both nursing dissimilar motives as regards each other. And meanwhile, Judith is being horribly set up for a total spiritual/emotional breakdown by a certain nefarious Iago-like presence in the home. As a result of her mounting disappointments she questions (abandons?) her religious faith, and is led in increasing measure to wallow in her secret vice... the real \\"passion\\" of Judith Hearne. And it is indeed, partaken in abject loneliness. Even the Church, represented by the tactless Father Quigley, rejects her cry for help. He heaps penitence and guilt where forgiveness and grace are needed.<br />This novel is brilliant in its portrayal of a woman at the very outer limits of disillusionment. Trapped by the passage of time. In the end, she looks in the mirror and smiles a costly smile. It has cost her the illusion, the pretence, and the ill-founded faith of all her years.Judith is being horribly set up for a total spiritual/emotional breakdown by a certain nefarious Iago-like presence in the home.

Having just finished this book hours ago, I could not wait to get online and 5-star recommend it to anyone out there in the wide world of amazon. What a fascinating book. One of the best memoirs I have ever read.<br />In November of 1937, Adeline was born in Tianjin China. She was the fifth child (one sister, three brothers) of the wealthy businessman Joseph Yen. Two weeks after Adeline's birth, her mother died, and her Aunt Baba was put in charge of the household. Joseph soon remarried, and with this new \\"Cruella de Ville\\"-type stepmother came the lifelong soul surgery of the entire family. Her name was Niang. Her tyranny knew no bounds, but it seemed to focus upon Adeline, and from her earliest years, the child incurred the senseless vindictive wrath of Niang.<br />Horrible injustices and restrictions were placed upon Adeline. As you read the story you will be amazed that she survived at all. Niang and Joseph had two children of their own, who were shamelessly favored. The rest of the family were treated as servants, in comparison. Adeline is sent to lonely seclusion in a far-off Catholic boarding school, and during very important formative years, all family contact is severed. We watch as Adeline's father is forced to go along with Niang's ridiculous rules and regulations, and she succeeds in dividing the loyalties of everyone in the family.<br />The story is heartwrenching. It's as though Adeline undergoes a lifelong soul surgery, repeatedly awakening from the anesthetic, only to collapse from the realized pain of reality. Many others have commented that this is a book with no happy ending. Certainly in the usual sense, there is no happy ending. For Adeline what was wrong never ever gets fully fixed, it only gets more and more broken. But the redeeming quality of the story is the remarkable absence of bitterness or revenge that we see in Adeline at the end of it all. She is the embodiment of forgiveness, generosity and love. At the same time we see the extent of damage that a self-centered, greedy, manipulative, venomous, vindictive person can inflict upon others. Throughout the story are a host of characters who fall somewhere down the middle, not exactly evil, but swayed by evil. Falling Leaves causes the reader to fully examine which type of person they themselves most resemble.damage that a self-centered, greedy, manipulative, venomous, vindictive person can inflict upon others.

The words \\"meine seele verlanget und sehnet\\" (my soul longs and sighs) are among the concluding sentiments in this book from the ever demure Ms. Horn. Actually \\"demure\\" is an understatement... in her thoroughgoing honest sort-of way, she is downright self-deprecating. And yet, Stacy is never self-loathing... never asking the reader for pity. So, as we read that she is the \\"self-proclaimed George Costanza of middle-aged women\\" we feel free to laugh along with her, knowing that she was probably giggling as she originally wrote it. She says, \\"I could live for T.V. I am that shallow\\" and \\"I choose to live on the surface because there's nothing good at the bottom.\\" How about... \\"I'm an idiot and I hate myself.\\" Or the statement that she is living a life in \\"permanent rerun.\\" It's as though the book is written by someone trying to convince us that she is nuts. She tells us things that most people would only tell their psychiatrist. But, in the process, because she is so honest, we find that a lot of her questions, struggles, and fears, are similar to our own. She gives a voice to a wide range of common human uncertainty, and like a good psychiatrist, we listen.<br />Through short pithy chapters we follow the development of her \\"dead-people support system\\". Stacy is obsessed about death. As a result, she is constantly engaged in various methods of keeping the connection between the past and the present alive. This involves umpteen visits to graveyards, lots of tombstone reading, geneology hunting... searching through long forgotten photo-albums, yearbooks and artifacts, microfiched obituaries. Conducting interviews with old people simply because they are nearer the fateful day than herself. She venerates longevity. She seeks a path between the isolated pockets of her own family's history. \\"The meaning I seek is only in my heart\\" she says, \\"and exists only because I want it to exist.\\"<br />I got the impression that Ms. Horn was anything but shallow. There's lots good at the bottom!<br />Strange? Yes! But strange NOT in the negative connotation that she always seemed to condemn herself towards. Alas, I've said nothing about her cats. But this review is already too long. Suffice it to say that this woman is crazy about her cats.

Discussing Black Robe, the author said, \\"...I'd never written a book like this before. I didn't want to write an historical novel because I don't particularly like historical novels... I wanted to write this as a tale. I thought of it in terms of authors I admire, like Conrad. I thought of Heart of Darkness, a tale, a journey into an unknown destination, to an unknown ending.\\" He was inspired to write Black Robe through his own experience of the vast Canadian landscape, the severe winter climate, and his own travels up and down the St. Lawrence River. His discovery of American historian Francis Parkman's study entitled \\"The Jesuits in North America\\" led Moore on a quest of further research, and soon he began to wonder... what if he had been fool enough to become a Jesuit and land himself in this Canadian wilderness, surrounded by people who seemed highly intelligent and terrifying all at once, and near impossible to convert? Black Robe was born.<br />It is set in the early seventeenth century. The zealous Jesuit missionary Father Laforgue must make a perilous journey up the Ottawa River to a remote outpost in order to to relieve an ailing priest of his duties there. After receiving permission from the Commandant, who is none other than Samuel Champlain, Laforgue sets off for Ihonatiria with his young apprentice Daniel Davost, and a convoy of canoes piloted by the native Algonkin guides. The trip proves to be even more perilous than was anticipated and Moore's tale becomes an experiment in bringing the character of the committed priest Laforgue to the limits of his beliefs and his ability to endure. And it pains him to watch Daniel's own spiritual disintegration.<br />This tale is superb in how it shows the clash of these two almost infinitely different cultures... the European Christian (and more specifically \\"Catholic\\") proselytizing mentality face to face with the Native belief in harmony with nature. One of the \\"Savages\\" sums up their opinion of Laforgue by saying \\"...listen Blackrobe. I am speaking against you today. You and your god do not suit our people. Your ways are not our ways. If we adopt them we will be neither Norman nor Huron. And soon our enemies will know our weakness and wipe us from the earth.\\" These natives live by relying on the interpretation of their dreams and by the forest speaking to them etc., things which the Jesuits considered useless or foolish, and a result of ignorance. But Moore is brilliant in showing how the natives saw the Jesuit ways as being equally mysterious and ridiculous (especially the whole idea of the Eucharist, how they viewed it as cannibalism. They called baptism the \\"water sorcery\\"). So everything about the natives that seemed to be based on a sort of primitive superstition was reciprocated in their perception of Jesuit practises and rituals. In this book we meet the Huron, the Iroquois, and the Algonkin as a handsome, brave, warlike, incredibly cruel people, who were in no way dependent on the white man and, in fact, judged him to be their physical and mental inferior. And we meet the Blackrobes, who willingly flung themselves into the midst of this culture, and unlike Conrad's exploitive colonialists, came not for the purpose of economic and political conquest, but for religious conversion of those whom they called \\"the Savages.\\"<br />One textual note: There is an immense amount of profanity in Black Robe, enough to warn the sqeamish about. According to the author's preface, the obscene language used by the natives at that time in history was a form of rough banter and was not intended to give offense.g \\"...listen Blackrobe.

And yet, it was given to me by a friend who could not endure reading any further than the first few chapters. I think it is the kind of story you either love or hate, it is dark and frustrating and definitely not a \\"feel-good\\". I can see how some could feel smothered and weary with the relentless pessimistic Hardyesque fatalism that Richards marinates this thing in... it's like Jude The Obsure meets the biblical Book of Job! But I like Hardy. And Job for that matter! So I did not mind the constant question that revolves in \\"Mercy\\" which is, \\"How is the Henderson family going to survive the terrible injustice, shame and misfortune that is hurled against them?\\" Does truth matter?<br />Set in rural New Brunswick, Lyle Henderson, now nineteen years old, narrates the history of his family... the misfortune and ostracism that began with his grandfather and was passed on down to Lyle's father Sydney. At the age of twelve, an accident happens and Sydney, mistaking his friend for dead and believing himself responsible, makes a rash vow to God. If the boy lives, Sydney will never harm another living soul. The boy gets up and walks away. Lyle's recollections chronicle the result of Sydney's radical superhuman commitment to an unlimited \\"turn-the-other-cheek\\" pacifism. Sydney subjects himself, and in turn, subjects his family to a life of utter poverty and ridicule in the face of escalating accusations and abuse that come from a community that is only too willing to take advantage of his non-resistance. As Lyle says at one point \\"My mother and father's dreams were always dispensable to certain people, who for some reason believed that they themselves and their dreams were indispensable.\\"<br />Sydney's life-philosophy is this: \\"No one can do an injury to you without doing an injury to themselves.\\" And secondly, \\"In man's heart is the only truth that matters.\\"<br />For the bulk of the book Richards does a tremendous job of showing us the frustration that comes from trying to actually live out the implications of Sydney's philosophy. Because here, as in real life, love and power are diametrically opposed. He who loves the most has the least power, and we find ourselves at times siding with Lyle... who is terribly sick of being trampled. But what's the alternative? To become a villain? It's not until the story comes full circle that we nod in agreement with Constable Delano, when he concludes about the Henderson family \\"The truth does matter!\\" You will be surprised at how much it matters.<br />What a profound and deeply moving, beautifully crafted book.

If Philip Yancey's publishers decided to market his new book in brown paper packaging with only a pricetag on the outside and not one word describing the contents, I would still be found at the counter, buying that book. I can say that for no other living Christian author that I am aware of. Soul Survivor is no disappointment. Again, Yancey has given his readers a relevant, insightful, honest-to-God, beautifully written book. Characteristically free of pretense.<br />Here is what it's about. Each chapter describes the life and work of someone whom Yancey considers to have helped him in his understanding of spirituality... they've shown him what it means to be spiritually aware of God in an ever-increasing measure. His introductory chapter amplifies the importance of the subtitle of the book, which is \\"How My Faith Survived The Church.\\" Here he describes how his early experience of \\"church\\" or \\"religion\\" was not always positive or nurturing for him (which is putting it mildly). At times, it was downright counter-productive! Filled with racial prejudice, legalism, and double-standards.<br />He found that if he had to rely only on the examples of Christianity found in his immediate and restricted surroundings, he may have lost hold of his personal faith altogether. But here he shows how these 13 remarkable individuals, some of whom he knew personally, others only having studied and read about, helped to restore and transform his own inner life. They became his mentors. Clicking on amazon's Table Of Contents feature above will show you a listing of these.<br />I was surprised though, that there was not a chapter on Alexander Solzhenitsyn here, for through my reading of other Yancey books I felt sure that A.S. had been a great influence in his life. But... what do I know?<br />The best summary is Yancey's own words in the Epilogue: \\"I have dealt mostly with the past in this book, for these guides set me on my own pilgrimmage at a crucial time when my beliefs were taking shape. As for the present - well, that's the subject of most of my other books...\\"s for the present - well, that's the subject of most of my other books...\\"	2002-02-04

As of 1998, The Diary of Anne Frank had reached sales of 25 million copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. (source: TIME, October 5, 1998). It has been required classroom reading for half a century now! In a way, her wish has come to pass.<br />This subsequent publication \\"Tales From The Secret Annex\\" combines short stories, reminiscences/vignettes, and even an unfinished novel to show us yet another dimension to this remarkable person. Reading these stories and little essays confirmed my personal opinion that Anne Frank was a childhood genius with unlimited potential to achieve anything she would have set her mind to. It's hard to imagine this thirteen year old girl writing with such depth and perception, while living in seclusion, terror and fear for her life. She was writing from her heart, not with an expectation of being published. And yet these stories shine with a polished brilliance, and a certain unforgettable quality. I read this book for the first time 8 years ago, and have returned to it now, remembering the stories as though I had read them just last week. My favorite is entitled \\"Kathy\\". In three short pages, Anne captures every emotion experienced by a kid who is misunderstood by her mother, assaulted by schoolyard bullies who mock and rob her and cause her to lose the gift she was bringing home to her mother.<br />Here is how she ends her essay entitled \\"Give\\":<br />\\"If only our country and then Europe and finally the whole world would realize that people were really kindly disposed toward one another, that they are all equal and everything else is transitory!<br />Open your eyes... give of yourself, give as much as you can! And you can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! No one has ever become poor from giving! If you do this, then in a few generations no one will need to pity the beggar children anymore, because they will not exist!<br />There is plenty of room for everyone in the world, enough money, riches, and beauty for all to share!

Always asking and re-asking, backpedalling, and here in the unseen realm the action is taking place, like a duck's feet underwater.<br />The nameless protagonist in Atwood's Surfacing is of this latter variety, contemplative and introspective. Together with three friends of the former type of personality (a married couple and her boyfriend Joe), these four drive off into the remote Quebec wilderness for a few days of R & R. This whirligig character however, has a far greater purpose in mind. She is returning here to her childhood home in search of her father who has mysteriously vanished without a trace. While these other three suntan, fish, and bicker, she is on a quest that calls forth a recollection of her entire upbringing and childhood. We sense that if she finds her father at all, it will be in a way that is as surprising to the reader as it will be to herself.<br />She's a great character. If it wasn't for her the others would seemingly starve to death, seated at the table and surrounded by victuals but unaware of how to prepare lunch. She's the organizer, the fish-filleter, the decision-maker... hourly explaining to her friends what will happen next. She is the individual who surfaces, thinks for herself, and finds an identity within. In stark contrast are her friends who seem to only find sustenance in the pieces they can bite off of each other and ingest.<br />As in so much of Atwood's work, these men are soon to reveal their inherent nasty dogness. On two occasions Whirligig avoids being (essentially) raped by each of them only by reminding them that it is \\"the right time\\" for her to get pregnant. But she is not a heroine without her own foibles. She realizes her own problems, the greatest of which may be her her inability to return the \\"love\\" that has been offered her throughout her life. Her detached coldness. But the importance in becoming whole (self-actualized?) may lie right there in this word \\"realizing\\", which, in the case of this novel MAY be synonymous with the word \\"surfacing\\". Throughout the book a central question seems to repeat itself... what does it mean to love? What if I don't \\"feel\\" love when someone says \\"I love you\\"? What does it mean to love one's past, one's history? To love your parents, your self... to love your lovers. And what does it mean to withdraw, to UTTERLY withdraw? These are the kind of meaty questions that surface in this book, brilliantly written and permeated with dark symbolism and a misty/ethereal 70's New-Ageyness to it. In Atwoodland, anything and everything can be a talisman.<br />\\"It's true, I am by myself; this is what I wanted, to stay here alone. From any rational point of view I am absurd; but there are are no longer any rational points of view.\\" Is Whirligig sane or insane on the last page? Surfacing or submerged?

In the introduction, the author states that \\"Although this novel is based on historical events, and many of the persons named are real, most of the characters are fictional.\\" Without this explanation I would have never categorized Obasan as a novel. As I read it, I rarely felt as though I was reading a novel... I felt like I was reading a memoir. That is not a negative thing, (I love memoirs) but so much of what is in Obasan seems like... non-fiction. I wish it had just come right out with it and said... THIS IS A MEMOIR. Skip the fiction altogether. It's confusing... did this or did this NOT actually happen to the author? It simply does not read like a novel. And perhaps that is a credit to the author's skill. I don't know. But if, for instance, the many dream sequences are \\"fictional\\", then I conclude that Kogawa's imagination and daring lost me more than once... Here is one such scene (by the way, there are no typos in this example): \\"I am in a hospital. Father is in a hospital. A chicken is in a hospital. Father is a chicken is a dream that I am in a hospital where my neck and chin are covered with a thick red stubble of hair and I am reading the table of contents of a book that has no contents.\\" These type of dream sequences (and there's many of them) seem nonsensical and don't add much to the overall \\"story\\" of Obasan... but if they are presented as \\"memoir\\" I can tolerate them much better. In other words, many moments, many chapters, I felt were not fictionally justified... they went nowhere! There seemed no purpose in making them up. At the end of the book I wondered why I had to know all that stuff about Old Man Gower next door UNLESS THIS IS A MEMOIR.<br />But Obasan is important for its historical significance. I am shamed to say that as a Canadian, I was not even aware of the persecution of the Japanese that took place in this country during World War II. Obasan is an appalling record of these terrible injustices. With the excuse that Canadians of Japanese origin represented a threat to national security, the Government of Canada passed a series of racially discriminatory (and racially motivated) laws and policies. In 1941, thousands were expelled from the province of B.C. (especially the coastal regions) and pushed inland and into Alberta for \\"resettlement\\". Property was seized and disposed of at the whim of the Government. Public pressure increased as the War went on, and by 1945, families that were already fractured and separated were permanently destroyed. A choice to go east of the Rockies or to Japan was presented without time for consultation with separated parents and children. Failure to make a swift choice was labelled as \\"non-cooperation\\". Obasan is the story of one such family that endured great hardships during this period. It begins in 1972, when the main character Naomi Nakane (now a schoolteacher) receives a phone call that her Uncle has passed away. She goes to comfort her grieving Aunt Obasan, and discovers a package that has recently arrived from another Aunt (Emily). Aunt Emily represents the uprooting of the past... she seeks to make sense of it all, and her package contains important documents and letters that Naomi would prefer to leave in the past. Soon Aunt Emily herself arrives at the house, and as she begins her uprooting, Naomi says with a tired sigh, \\"Life is so short, the past so long. Shouldn't we turn the page and move on?\\" \\"The past is the future,\\" Aunt Emily replies.<br />And so begins the story of Naomi's life... through her own recollections, through dream sequences, Aunt Emily's journal, newspaper clippings, government documents, letters... the story is told. Exactly what happened to Naomi's mother and father?<br />The story returns in the end to 1972, where the adult Naomi reflects on how they were treated as a family and as a people. \\"The Government makes paper airplanes out of our lives and files us out the windows.\\" It is reprehensible, a terrible reproach, that one person summarizes this period in Canadian history in such a way... and a tragedy that thousands do!ummarizes this period in Canadian history in such a way... and a tragedy that thousands do!	2002-01-21

This is the perfect book for someone who wants to learn the essentials about the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi without having to wade through some of the larger books that have been written. This one is under 200 pages, and is laid out in three easy to read sections (From Birth To Greatness - Gandhi In India - Victory and Tragedy). Fischer does not bog down into political minutiae, post-assassination trial stuff, or hair-splitting Gandhi-isms (on this latter point for instance, Gandhi's own autobiography devotes four consecutive chapters to his internal agony over whether or not to include goat's milk in his vegetarian diet)! Fischer's book is more of an OVERVIEW of the profound world-shaking life that was Gandhi. Yet it is immensely informative, and well-paced. The author personally met with Gandhi in 1942 and again in '46, and his book shows that he had a wonderful understanding of the Mahatma's faith and convictions. Those who want to know more about Gandhi should, however, go on to read the autobiography (subtitled &quot;The Story of My Experiments With Truth&quot;) and also Yogesh Chadha's &quot;Gandhi: A Life&quot;.<br />The book ends abruptly with the three shots, the smile fading from Gandhi's face, and his final words on earth &quot;Oh God.&quot;<br />&quot;His legacy is courage, his lesson truth, his weapon love.<br />His life is his monument.<br />He now belongs to mankind.&quot;<br />We turn the page, and hope that something is there... but it isn't. The world since, has not seen anyone like Gandhi.	2002-01-14

Lewis&quot;	It is said that as regularly as the mail arrived, professor Lewis sat down at his desk and personally responded... even if the correspondents were little children who had come to know of him through his Narnia books. In fact, he felt it was his God-given duty to do so! &quot;C.S. Lewis: Letters to Children&quot; is a collection of these heartfelt responses, spanning nearly 20 years (1944-1963).<br />Lewis's own direct contact with children was limited. He once said, &quot;I theoretically hold that one ought to like children, but am shy with them in practice.&quot; (Letter to Arthur Greeves, Dec.'35). And in his &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; he says (chap.1, para.11) &quot;I myself do not enjoy the society of small children... I recognize this as a defect in myself.&quot; What he may have lacked in direct contact with children he certainly seems to have displaced with these personal letters, in which we see a lofty Oxford academic who is able to freely converse with children about such diverse topics as (of all things) Zoroastrianism, cats, the Gauls, Virgilian hexameter, the Renaissance, and his opinion that human faces are much easier to draw than animal faces. Never does he talk DOWN to his younger &quot;friends&quot;. He usually signs off with an affectionate &quot;yours ever&quot;! And often he sprinkles a question or two of his own in a letter, which, rather than dismissing the sender, invites a response, showing he values these children. For example, an American girl (Joan) received 28 letters from Lewis over a 20 year period!<br />Why do I give this book a rating of 5 stars? Is the writing as deep, weighty, and significant as War &amp; Peace? Not even remotely. But, to me, it is remarkable that an academician/author of the caliber of C.S. Lewis found the time to write such beautiful simple letters to inquiring kids all over the world. There's something very refreshing (for Lewis fans like me at least) about picking this book up and just turning at random to any letter. One ends with &quot;It is still cold here but the snowdrops, crocuses, primroses and daffodils are up and the thrushes are building nests.&quot; Or another &quot;Well, I can't say I have had a happy Easter, for I have lately got married and my wife is very, very ill.&quot; Such disclosure is an example of the respect Lewis felt children worthy of. One word of caution though: Does a proper appreciation of this book require a familiarity with Lewis's works? Quite frankly: Yes! The Narnia books! Because so many of the letters are alluding to Narnia, readers unfamiliar with that cycle of books may find most of this book quite boring.<br />Lewis never tired of corresponding with his child fans. His final letter, to a boy named Philip was written on November 21, 1963. The following day Lewis passed away peacefully at his Oxford home. Earlier, he had written the following to a group of fifth graders:<br />&quot;I'm tall, fat, rather bald, red-faced, double-chinned, black-haired, have a deep voice, and wear glasses for reading.<br />The only way for us to get to Aslan's country is through death, as far as I know: perhaps some very good people get just a tiny glimpse before then.<br />Best love to you all.

In it, Brian Moore explores one man's heroic attempt to shift position in the world. Ginger Coffey leaves the unpromising economic situation in Dublin Ireland to pursue his idea of the Great Canadian Dream. With wife and daughter in tow, he arrives in Montreal in the dead of winter with $15.03 to his name. He has been waiting a long time for this golden opportunity. It soon becomes apparent however, that Canada was not as eagerly waiting for him!<br />He manages to land a job at The Tribune, but rather than his desired position as journalist, he wallows among the other galley slaves as a lowly proofreader. They collectively suffer under an exploitative and humiliating boss, MacGregor. Because of his radical Irish optimism, Coffey is blind to the emptiness of the editor's promise to promote him to journalist &quot;one day soon&quot;. Before that mysterious day which never arrives, Coffey is further forced to augment his meager wages by accepting a job as a diaper delivery man for a company called TINY-ONES. Is this the Utopia that he crossed an ocean for? Utopia-shmopia! But while his Great Canadian Dream is shattering he hears some trans-Atlantic gossip that suggests the situation back in Ireland is even worse! So his choice of Montreal is now an irrevocable one, if for no other reason than it at least affords him some anonymity until he hits the big time. But even this anonymity is brutalized one day when he encounters an old Dublin girlfriend while he is in the full garb of his TINY-ONES uniform. This is only one of a series of humiliations that Coffey experiences, not the least of which is the fact that his marriage is threatened, and he fears that his wife Vera is involved with an associate of his. His fears are correct... her involvement with the successful journalist Gerry Grosvenor amounts to a sort of clandestine infidelity, but unknown to Ginger, it has not been adulterous. At any rate, soon they are poised for a divorce. But the coup de grace in Ginger's bad luck comes one cold winter night as he stumbles out of a bar after drinking far too much of a mixture of wine and Coca-Cola. While waiting for the bus, he feels the need to unburden his bladder somewhat, and (thinking that he was up against an unoccupied office building) relieves himself in the doorway of one of the biggest hotels in the city! He is arrested for indecent exposure and has his (hilarious) day in court. In this case, the luck of the Irish turns out to be a six-month suspended sentence.<br />It looks like things could get no worse. Coffey returns home to gather up his things and leave his family. But amazingly, his final courtroom incident has led to some genuine &quot;luck&quot; in the life of Ginger Coffey. A great final chapter shows us the joy that comes from true forgiveness and reconciliation. Ginger Coffey must resign himself to the fact that some very simple things in life (the renewed love of his wife, the steadfast love of his daughter) are like the consolation prizes in his uphill run through life. In the end he celebrates the retention of roughly no more than what he arrived with in Canada... his original $15.03. But, along with that fortune, he now has a new understanding of what makes life important.<br />This was Moore's first novel with a Canadian setting, published in 1960 after the Irish-born author himself had spent twelve years living in Canada. He was personally familiar with what it is like to be an immigrant emerging from Montreal's Dorchester Street bus terminal into the same sort of frozen slush, snow and gloom that Ginger Coffey experienced. And Moore's interest in this novel seems to be an investigation into the ways in which public myths (the Great Canadian Dream) reflect and encourage private fantasies (I'm going to get rich when I get there). Coffey's conclusion was that &quot;life was the victory... going on was the victory.&quot; That the true challenge and test in life resides in the private domain, in intimate relationships. It is for this reason that the central drama of the story, which is intertwined with Ginger's search for wealth and public recognition in the New World, is the collapse of his marriage to Vera. Moore deals with these serious themes in a novel that is very light to read and even &quot;comic&quot; at most points.

By &quot;High&quot; Spirits in the title, Davies' is referring to the fact that the ghosts in these stories are most often of lofty earthly lineage. They are &quot;highly&quot; extracted. In these 18 stories we meet the ghosts of King George the V and VI of Great Britain, Queen Victoria, Sir John A. MacDonald, Saint George of Cappadocia, William Lyon Mackenzie King, and John Strachan (founder of Massey College) to name but a few. These are no ordinary run-of-the-mill random ghosts, and these are not &quot;scary&quot; ghost stories. They are moreso HUMOROUS and were meant originally to entertain guests at the annual Gaudy Nights held at Massey College when Davies was Master there.<br />While these stories are very well-done (original and highly inventive) and no doubt caused quite a stir in their time, to read them now seems quite dated. The inferences and specific allusions to college life are lost on the modern reader who may not have a conversational grasp of Canadian political history, or a knowledge of the finer points of Massey College's quadrangles and inner sanctums. All in all, these stories are best TOLD to their original hearers... a few times I had the sense that I would have liked to have been in attendence as Davies' recited these to his guests. But to sit and read them nowadays?... I don't know, at the end of each story I sort of felt like... &quot;so what?&quot; I am a big fan of Davies' writing, but this is not a book I would highly recommend to anyone getting to know his work.	2001-12-18

The bulk of the story takes place on the near-deserted Indonesian island of Samburan, where Axel Heyst, the reclusive Swede, has chosen to make his hermitage. In an important vignette about midway through the novel Conrad lets us in on the origin of Heyst's cynical and disillusioned attitude toward life. Here, as his father lies dying, Heyst asks for some final guidance, some final advice about life. His father tells him that all people are pitiful, and &quot;you... if you are anything, are as pitiful as the rest.&quot; &quot;What is one to do then?&quot; asks Heyst. &quot;Look on - make no sound&quot; were his father's last words to him. This profoundly affected Heyst, and stayed with him, and a fortnight later he started on his travels - &quot;to look on and never make a sound&quot;.<br />He leads a wandering life and avoids contact with others. Intimacy is foreign to him, but he has a truly magnanimous, altruistic heart, and one day on the island of Timor, he impulsively pays the fines for the captain of a trading ship (Morrison) and bails him out of certain financial ruin. As a result, Heyst is offered employment in a coal company, and when Morrison dies, Heyst becomes the owner. The company goes bankrupt, but rather than leave for greener... islands, Heyst decides to stay there with his servant, the &quot;Chinaman&quot; Wang.<br />On a neighboring island, a hotel keeper by the name of Schomburg begins to circulate rumors about &quot;the Swede&quot;, rumors that include blaming Heyst for the untimely death of Morrison. Heyst, (completely unaware of Schomburg's malicious hatred) makes a rare visit to the hotel, and while staying there, he is again moved to action by his sensitivity and altruism. This time, he becomes involved in the troubled life of one of the showgirls, a violinist by the name of Alma (Heyst changes her name later to Lena). He rescues her from the loathsome Schomburg's amorous intentions, and carries her off to his island. This infuriates the already hateful hotel keeper, and soon a wandering trio of deperadoes provide the perfect means for murderous revenge. Under the unfounded pretense that Heyst has hidden vast stores of loot on his island, Schomburg convinces these three thugs to invade Samburan, capture their due reward, and return the girl to Schomburg. What follows is an intense psychological/physical battle of wits and bodies. The scoundrels are armed and accustomed to shedding blood, while Heyst and Lena are completely unarmed and defenceless. When Lena is alone and suddenly confronted by one of the villains, she feigns sympathy for their plan, and begins to work a duplicity that even Heyst is unaware of. She takes it upon herself to divest the villainous Ricardo of his weapon. She becomes the sacrificial heroine... working a very, VERY bittersweet &quot;victory&quot;. To say more is to say too much... I'm sure Conrad would visibly cringe to find that modern readers knew about the last chapter before reading the first.<br />In many ways Victory ends up being a love story. A story of a developing love... that was horribly infringed upon, invaded! Brutal as Romeo and Juliet. It is beautiful how the devotion, charm and innocence of Lena was slowly plowing up the fallow ground of Heyst's long-forgotten heart.

For me, the book is about peace, or more specifically inner peace, and how different people choose to approach their ideas of inner peace and equilibrium. I think it's interesting how Maugham concludes by saying that all of the characters achieved a sort of happiness in their own ways. But wow... the diverse ways they did so! I thought it was really innovative how Maugham included himself in the story, as the ubiquitous confidante.<br />Of course, Larry is the pivot, the hinge character. Everyone has to come to one or another conclusion about Larry... but he is not obligated to do so in return. He is indifferent to the pursuits of others, yet everyone is concerned with Larry's pursuits. Isn't it interesting how that while everyone seems to be so involved in evaluating Larry's stability and sanity, he remains the most stable and sane of them all? While lives are undulating... Larry has, for the most part, spent the decade on an even keel. Others are gasping, he is sighing. And nothing seems to sway Larry's convictions about what is really important in life. I think this is the quality that makes him admirable. Success or failure will not determine Larry's sense of purpose and meaning. (Larry himself admits in his final talk with the narrator that he really hasn't found the ultimate ANSWER to his original quest of unravelling the nature of evil in the world. No, in the end he concludes basically that perhaps &quot;the values we cherish in the world can only exist in combination with evil.&quot; Perhaps all we can really do is &quot;make the best of it.&quot;) Rather than actually &quot;changing the world&quot; he thinks that he may be at least able to create &quot;a ripple effect&quot; like a stone thrown into the water. The true GREATNESS of Larry is his strength of inner conviction and achievement of peace regardless of outward cost and opinion of others in the process.<br />At any rate... I have one question that I believe we as readers can ask ourselves that will point out our true reaction to meeting Maugham's Larry in The Razor's Edge, and the question is this: If dear darling Isabel were our niece, or our daughter... how would we counsel her, if she were faced with the option of marrying either Larry or Gray? (knowing what we knew of each of these characters in the earlier part of the book). I think it's a good question. Would we encourage her to consider the man who was perhaps less earthly ambitious, but who was asking the BIG questions of his world... or would we encourage her to &quot;go for the money&quot; and latch onto the man who seemed to have nowhere's to go but UP... especially when we were conscious of the fact that her own heart's desire, indeed, her true love, was for the former man! I haven't read any other books by Maugham but this one inspires me to do so.

The driving force or motivation behind the traveling was a sort of pursuit of the &quot;idea of not living a lie.&quot; (More on what &quot;the lie&quot; is in a bit). The author is convinced that self-propelled, purposeful traveling is &quot;the broadest educational institution accessible to man, short of the afterlife.&quot; In other words (mine), how can a person have a mature, truth-based worldview... without viewing the WORLD at some point? Limiting ourselves to our own narrow frame of reference (only the culture we grew up in, for instance), stifles growth. Exposure leads to growth/maturity, a broadening of one's perception of reality and appreciation of truth. &quot;When we halt or hinder exposure, we stop growing.&quot;<br />Do those type of ideas excite you? Cause you to wonder? Well, you'd love this book then. So far I am making it sound like some sort of textbook, but nothing could be further from the truth. The first 2/3rds of the book is a journaling or memoir, written in a very engaging and witty way... at times it is laugh-out-loud funny... and then the next page is very sobering, and will call for some contemplative digesting. What I most enjoy about the book is how it truly causes me to ask important questions of my own seemingly invulnerable existence. For me, it was very cage-rattling.<br />The latter third of the book is an APPLICATION of truths gleaned during the author's ongoing odyssey of the spirit. I would rather not name or otherwise &quot;give away&quot; what he calls the First and Second Objective Truths. To do so in this limited space would be unjust. In chapter 24, Joseph's treatment of the IMPLICATIONS of these truths as they relate to our first-world concepts of race, gender, money, power, and culture was brilliant. This, and the next chapter entitled &quot;Nation&quot; were like the gathering thunder of a tympani-drum roll in a symphony just before the final cymbal crash. If you're not nodding in agreement in these chapters, it can only be because your head is so firmly rammed into the ground!<br />What is this idea of &quot;not living a lie&quot;? Well, the &quot;lie&quot; is the blind (unconscious or unaware) acceptance of inconsistency within us. This, coupled with our knee-jerk defense of &quot;false reality&quot; creates an illness that we as first-worlders are especially susceptible to, due to our relative affluence and almost innate sense of superiority in the world. It's so true isn't it? We DO tend to defend our little wee realities with a vehemance that seems to come naturally. Question: Why do we do it? Answer: Because, small it is, we don't want that false reality disturbed in any way. TRANSCEND is a profound and worthwhile book written by and about someone who purposefully CHOSE to disturb the false reality within himself. Repeatedly. Anyone reading it with even a half open mind will be challenged to consider many previously unasked questions within themselves.

I love how Moore flings us headlong into the abrupt mid-action opening sentences of this story... &quot;What do you mean there's no room for her?&quot; Bernard said. &quot;Didn't you get my letter?&quot;<br />It's like that old television quip: &quot;We now return you to programming already in progress...&quot; The opening scene here is the front desk of a prestigious London hotel, within sight of Buckingham Palace. 34 year old Ulster businessman Bernard McAuley is straightening out what seems to be a screw-up in the reservations. Eileen Hughes, twenty years old and never before out of Northern Ireland, has just arrived with Bernard and his wife Mona, who are not only her employers but also, (she believes) her greatest friends. They've invited her on one of their jaunts. The worldly-wise Mona seems to have adopted the virginal-innocent Eileen as her special pet. Bernard is obsessed (in opposite ways) with BOTH of them... and for the time being, Eileen is completely unaware of the extent of Bernard's posessive love of her - expressed in his wish to give her everything she desires. She will not be unaware for long. Bernard soon goes against his better judgment and confesses that he wishes to posess her as one would posess a religious icon or aesthetic artefact.<br />The action of the book is compressed into two days (with an introductory day and a few brief scenes on later days) and during this time Bernard's excessive (and oddly platonic, or as Bernard refers to it &quot;courtly&quot;) devotion to Eileen leads her to a sharp recognition of the madness in which she is trapped... and leads Bernard to drunken, suicidal despair. And what of Mona? Goodness... she's too busy shopping and courting her own lovers to be concerned with either of them!<br />Eileen discovers that nothing between the McAuleys, or between the McAuley's and herself, is as she imagined it to be. She is tempted... in many ways, and in many directions in the course of this vacation. She is bombarded with new experiences... including the initiation into marijuana and sex by a casual American stud/hippie whom she meets in the hotel.<br />What will she choose in regard to her temptations? The intoxicating adventure and glamour represented by European cities... held out to her on a platter by Bernard? Or a return to her dreary life in Lismore, Northern Ireland where she lives with her widowed invalid mother? How will her decisions affect her, and the other people involved?

THEME: Personal struggle for survival in a Stalinist concentration camp. A more literal translation of the title from the Russian would be &quot;The Day Of Ivan Denisovich&quot;. This &quot;one day&quot; is seen through the eyes of the hero Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a humble peasant who during WWII was captured by the Germans. After his escape he came back to the Russian lines where he was arrested, accused of being an enemy spy (forced by Soviet counterintelligence officers to sign his own &quot;confession&quot;), and sentenced to ten years hard labor.<br />The story follows the routine details of Shukhov's life: jolted out of a frozen slumber at 5 a.m.; a breakfast of slop and boiled gruel with fish skeletons floating next to rotten cabbage leaves; roll call in the polar frost, followed by a ravenous-dog-escorted march to work where prisoners mix cement and build walls in the utter desolation of the Northern steppe. The author's depiction of this ceaseless slavery is literally mind-numbing.<br />On the way back to the barracks the men are meticulously searched for anything they may be attempting to smuggle in. Shukhov privately revels over a piece of wire and a string that he has managed to sneak past the guards. After all, who knows how vitally necessary these items may be &quot;one day&quot;!  At the end of this particular day's near-deathly labor, Shukhov actually feels fortunate that he has managed to finagle an extra bowl of skeleton soup, get some shreds of tobacco, and keep from being thrust into solitary confinement for any one of the million minor offenses of the camp. The story ends: &quot;The end of an unclouded day. Almost a happy one. Just one of the 3,653 days of his sentence, from bell to bell. The extra three were for leap years.&quot; The final point reminding us of the Gulag system's merciless punitive accuracy. A world of no parole... and no reprieve.<br />The reader is chilled by this book. It is shivering. Do we pick up anything by Solzhenitsyn for its &quot;warmth and fuzziness&quot;? Most definitely not. We pick him up to come face to face with mankind's capacity to methodically inflict cruelty and despair upon others. In the process, we are always afforded a very important glimpse of what those &quot;others&quot; can endure. And we set Solzhenitsyn down, thankful that we are none of his characters... even as we realize that some very real people (including the author himself) did not have that luxury.for its &quot;warmth and fuzziness&quot;?

I am rounding off my actual 3.5 stars upward to a *4*... in other words, closer to a 4 than a 3! In The Fall was the latest book in the online reading-group that I am a part of, and my overall opinion of the book was the most lenient among us! Most of my negative criticism would be directed at the writing style early on in Part I where my constant thought was &quot;What is with all of this sentence fragmentation?&quot; I've never seen anything like it. Lent's unique sentence and paragraph structure certainly is unnerving at first, and left me wondering if this was intentionally done to exemplify the idiom of late 19th Century America? Or what? I still don't know. I think that readers should be warned that, grammatically speaking, the greater majority of Lent's sentences (in this early section) are actually lacking the &quot;subject&quot; portion... as though the reader is supposed to fill in the blanks. The subject is not plainly given, it is assumed!<br />But I enjoyed the content of Part I which tells the passionate story of how wounded soldier Norman Pelham is rescued by the fugitive slave Leah. They journey to his childhood home in Vermont where together they raise a family. Leah is increasingly haunted by her past however, and events conspire to shatter the general bucolic bliss they, for the most part, enjoyed. Part II is the story of their son Jamie, and Part III deals with Jamie's son, Foster. The inner struggles of three generations are chronicled, and many comments have been made that Part II is almost entirely superfluous, and the story could have been adequately told if this part was omitted altogether. I disagree. I think that &quot;shortening&quot; it would be better than eliminating it. Part II is essential because I think the author wanted to put a sort-of &quot;distance&quot; between the Norman/Leah story and the Foster/Daphne story, to show us that it is possible to &quot;break the mold&quot; (I can't think of a better term) of our generational curses. (Family secrets might be a synonym). But this can only be done by someone who CHOOSES to stand outside of his own anger or resentment, and face the past objectively. To stare at the portrait of the past (as Foster does at the home of Abigail and Prudence) until that portrait speaks to you. The tragic story of Jamie in Part II shows us someone who runs and hides from the past. Foster, in Part II, purposefully runs INTO the past. His end is at least... hopeful.<br />Reading In The Fall felt, at times, like hiking uphill... early on I wished that I was equipped with better boots.

They both abandoned it on grounds that it seemed to &quot;lag&quot; or just not catch their interest forcefully enough. I alone finished it, and I admit that it helps if one has a sort of preliminary undaunting interest in the period of history that is covered here... otherwise, there are sections that do seem to be tedious. For me, Book 2 seemed to lack momentum... as though this was the time when Uris really geared down, or at least had the clutch engaged, and I felt that if something didn't happen soon with the previously developed characters the whole story was going to come to a dust-rattling stop. But Book 3, 4 and 5 really took off, and made me realize how necessary the background of the less exciting section really was. I feel bad that my friends didn't get to these parts.<br />Of course, Uris invents fictional situations and characters to bring to life a very controversial time in world history, the founding of the nation of Israel. Does he get all of his facts in order? I don't know. How can an account of an issue that is still so divisive even in our present day EVER be concluded as historically &quot;accurate&quot; by everyone involved? Impossible. I have my own opinion, but I guess that's all it is. I trust that the things which are historically verifiable (for instance, the actual partition resolution vote by the General Assembly of The United Nations) are not overly &quot;fictionalized&quot;. Beyond that, I can only say that Uris created some very memorable characters, and tremendously moving scenes that I will never forget. The latter half of the book is worth sticking around for. (This is something I'm still mentioning to my two friends). This from page 551 sort of summarizes the gist of what Exodus is saying: &quot;There never was a question of the Jews' willingness to die for Israel. In the end they stood alone and with blood and guts won for themselves what had legally been given them by the conscience of the world. And so - the Star of David, down for two thousand years, shone from Elath to Metulla, never to be lowered again.&quot;conscience of the world.

I believe that anything Dr. Kubler-Ross has written is worthy of our attention, and this autobiographical book is no exception. I just finished it today... found it very thought-provoking overall. However, this particular one needs to be read more CRITICALLY than her others, and I don't mean &quot;skeptically&quot; in a negative sense so much as simply &quot;requiring careful judgment&quot;... especially the last third of the book. In this latter section, the author really gets specific about her experiences with &quot;channeling the other side&quot; and outlines her concept of her own &quot;cosmic consciousness.&quot; I tried to be as enlightened and open as possible, and yet found that I could just not buy into everything she had experienced and was teaching others to experience. I am referring mainly to her ongoing relationships with disembodied spirits, her ability to conjure them up at will, and (maybe most remarkably) their apparent ability to physically manifest themselves (as in, writing things down on a piece of paper in response to her questions). She refers to these spirit-friends as her &quot;spooks&quot; and by her own admission at one point she even attributes the collapse of her otherwise successful marriage to her profound belief in these entities. Many people felt she had lost her marbles. She admits that a few of the experiences were proved to be the hoax of her Californian spiritual instructor, whom she calls &quot;B&quot;. Also, throughout the last half of the book is an underlying allusion to her belief in re-incarnation.<br />For the first half of the book I could think of so many people I would have recommended it to, but then it suddenly arrived at a place where I think a reader has to be very selective, or adept at SIFTING through to their own concept of truth. Very critical. Be aware of that if you intend to give this book as a gift to someone.<br />I agree thoroughly with the core principles of what can rightfully be called Kubler-Ross's thanatology. I agree with her that death does not exist in the traditional sense, and that life in a physical body represents a very short span of one's total existence. That at the moment of death human beings maintain an awareness and can still make observations, have thoughts, be free of pain, and that all of this has nothing to do with psychopathology. That those who pass from life into death are simply passing into &quot;a different wavelength than the rest of us.&quot; I agree that our body &quot;imprisons our soul the way a cocoon encloses the future butterfly, and when the time is right we can let go of it.&quot; She says that the butterfly is then free to return &quot;home to God... which is a place where we are never alone, where we continue to grow and to sing and to dance, where we are with those we loved, and where we are surrounded with more love than we can ever imagine.&quot; I wish that this last sentiment was more emphasized in the book, rather than appearing in the next to last page. Because it seems inconsistent to me that if the spirits return home to God (which I firmly believe), then what are we to make of the ones that were roaming around in the elevators, appearing in the author's bed, and in the flower-garden etc.? Maybe we should just leave those sort of spirits alone instead of trying to make them our pals? Hey, our lives ARE definitely going someplace! Life is indeed a sort of &quot;wheel&quot;.

This is a truly fascinating book, and I can't imagine how it could be improved upon. If you consider the work of C.S. Lewis to be worthy of further investigation, Carnell's book should be essential reading for you. He argues correctly that spiritual longing or &quot;sehnsucht&quot; is, and has been a basic concept in literature through the ages, sometimes being referred to as Romanticism, or at least the &quot;common denominator&quot; in Romanticism. He shows us how it is prevelant in Wordsworth, Blake, Juvenal, Voltaire, Auden, Dylan Thomas, Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and in less likely places, such as Saul Bellow, Theodore Dreiser, and even Beatrix Potter. Carnell is convinced however, that the clearest place we can learn about sehnsucht is by reading what Lewis said about it, both didactically and in his fiction. I thoroughly agree.<br />Sehnsucht is hard to define. It is the compulsive quest, which brings with it both fleeting joy and the sad realization that one is yet separated from what is desired. Yet, it is more than this... it is ceaseless longing, it is causeless melancholy, it is ecstatic wonder. It is nostalgia. The hush of the deep mystery of man's finitude and creatureliness coupled with a sense of the numinous. My own definition: it is the incomprehensible momentarily made known, with the proviso that one cannot carry it away, prolong it, or even reproduce it. &quot;Effort, and expectation, and desire / And something evermore about to be.&quot; &lt;Wordsworth&gt;<br />By recounting Lewis's personal experiences of sehnsucht, and by an examination of his writings on the topic, Carnell creates a flawless sehnsuchtopedia that has the page-turning quality of a good novel. Do not hesitate to get this new re-issue of a tremendous book.	2001-10-11

After all, he arrives scientifically at &quot;theistic&quot; conclusions that I already believe in by way of faith alone. At any rate, I tried to distance myself from religious presuppositions and read the book in as &quot;unbiased&quot; a fashion as I could. Swinburne's conclusions seemed to be very REASONABLE. I liked this excerpt, from chapter 4: &quot;It is extraordinary that there should exist anything at all. Surely the most natural state of affairs is simply nothing: no universe, no God, nothing. But there is something. And so many things. Maybe chance could have thrown up the odd electron. But so many particles! Not everything will have an explanation. But the whole progress of science and all other intellectual enquiry demands that we postulate the smallest number of brute facts. If we can explain the many bits of the universe by one simple being which keeps them in existence, we should do so - even if inevitably we cannot explain the existence of that simple being.&quot;<br />In a limited way, Swinburne's work responds to many ideas postulated in books such as Richard Dawkin's &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; (1986) and Stephen Hawking's &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; (1988)... books which carry the suggestion that there is no God who is in any way involved in the sustaining of the universe. Swinburne's special field of expertise is in Philosophy of Religion, and as such, he is able to show us that &quot;it is not a rational conclusion to suppose that explanation stops where science does&quot;. He presents a convincing argument that theism is the best explanation for the conformity of nature to formula, and the vast, all pervasive temporal order that characterizes the known universe. Why is there a universe AT ALL? Why is there ANY life on earth? HOW is it that discoverable scientific laws operate in the universe? Reading this book will help you to consider that perhaps the best answers to these questions can be offered by someone who allows for the existence of God.best answers to these questions can be offered by someone who allows for the existence of God.	2001-10-09

These three points combine to make Humphrey Carpenter's work a benchmark in the ever growing sea of books about Tolkien. The third point, (meeting Tolkien) actually makes for a very amusing first four pages... Carpenter describing exactly what it was like to find himself standing before this Ent-like genius of a man... &quot;Again I struggle to think of an intelligent remark, and again he resumes before I can find one.&quot;<br />I picked up Carpenter's book directly after my second reading of The Lord Of The Rings (reading Tolkien is definitely hobbit-forming), and I was not disappointed. It spans a timeframe of around 82 years, and we learn all about Tolkien's ancestry, early years, his life-long love of languages, his lengthy courtship and marriage to Edith Bratt (both were lengthy), his service as soldier in WWI, his devoted fathering of four children,the development of his mythology and struggles with procrastination, the creation and publication of his stories and subsequent fame, the accolades, and the quiet return to Oxford after the death of his wife. Never does this book falter, and never will the thought &quot;oh, get on with it already&quot; enter the mind of the reader.<br />I've just finished the book tonight, and I am now convinced that Tolkien was a hobbit. At one point he confesses, &quot;I am in fact a hobbit in all but size. I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food (unrefrigerated), but detest French cooking; I like, and even dare to wear in these dull days, ornamental waistcoats. I am fond of mushrooms (out of a field); have a very simple sense of humour (which even my appreciative critics find tiresome); I go to bed late and get up late (when possible). I do not travel much.&quot;<br />Tolkien was profoundly acquainted with his subject matter. He only wrote about things he &quot;knew&quot;.

Anyone interested in these legendary writers cannot miss out on reading this book (the trick is in FINDING it)! Lewis (d.1963), Tolkien (d.1973) and Williams (d.1945) were, and remain, three of the most profound and influential authors of the 20th Century. Carpenter's book captures the atmosphere of the friendship that existed between these three &quot;Oxonians&quot; as they met to drink beer on Tuesdays at the &quot;Bird &amp; Baby&quot; and read selections from their works in progress. Among the &quot;friends&quot; who can also be considered Inklings we find R.E. Havard, Owen Barfield, Hugo Dyson, Colin Hardie, David Cecil, Lewis's brother Warnie and others that I'm forgetting here. Through Carpenter's excellent book we get to lean in on the banter of unrivalled literary wit and wisdom. Here in &quot;The Inklings&quot; we get as close as possible to an understanding of the depth of these great minds... in these meetings, great works such as The Lord of The Rings, The Screwtape Letters, and All Hallows Eve were read aloud for the first time to the laughter, approval and/or criticism of those at table.<br />Carpenter's book is very well written, well laid out and had me captivated from start to finish.

I've just finished reading the Lord Of The Rings for the second time. My first reading of it was about three years ago. Amazingly, (and I think this says something of the quality of the story itself) I would say I enjoyed it even more this second time around. It is so sweeping and wide that it still thrills, never losing any of its unpredictablity even if one is already familiar with the ending. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so immense, such an entire &quot;sub-creation&quot; (as the author himself referred to it)... complete with its own creatures, history, languages, and breathtaking landscapes... I believe it is without parallel in fantasy literature of any era. This book is myth, rather than allegory. By that I mean that there is not really meant to be any strict one-to-one correspondence to specifically theological, political, or psychological aspects of our own &quot;real&quot; world. No-one in Middle-Earth is named Mr. Worldly-Wiseman or Mr. Evangelist or Mr. Charity. No, here we meet people and things like Tom Bombadil, Gollum or Treebeard... hobbits, elves, dwarves, ents, orcs and yes, even Men. And yet, as with great allegorical works all of these characters gravitate to one of two poles or extremes that can be seen as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. The Lord of The Rings is truly about a grandiose struggle between the FORCES of good and evil. In Chapter 2 of Book 2 we read that &quot;Good and ill have not changed... nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves and another among Men.&quot; An interesting thing about the book is how Tolkien's brand of &quot;dualism&quot; very subtly points to the reality that ultimate Good or Evil is something yet greater (or beyond) any of the characters that try to perpetrate either of them. This is most clear in a statement by Gandalf in Book 3 during &quot;The Last Debate&quot; where he says &quot;Other evils there are that may come; for Sauron is himself but a servant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.&quot; If Sauron (who throughout the book appears as the evil to be reckoned with) is &quot;but a servant or emissary&quot;... then we must consider the question... an emissary of what? Or whom? And similarly, if all of the &quot;good&quot; that the Fellowship of The Ring strives to achieve will yet not &quot;master all of the tides of the world&quot;... then where is this locus of ULTIMATE good? Gandalf makes it clear that their own &quot;goodness&quot; is limited to the years wherein they are set. At the end of The Lord of The Rings, the future yet belongs to the good AND the evil that lie beyond the powers of any of the characters that have played a part in the present conflict. Maybe we are supposed to wonder... who IS the Lord of the rings? Almost 50 years ago C.S. Lewis, a friend of Tolkien's, said of The Lord of The Rings: &quot;Such a book has of course its predestined readers, even now more numerous and more critical than is always realised. To them a reviewer need say little, except that here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart.&quot; And I too, could go on forever about it, but my best suggestion is for you to quit reading this, and just read the book.

I will never finish this book (in the sense of setting it aside and forgetting about it). I will never quit reading it, ad-infinitum, but never ad-nauseum. I pick it up again and again, especially in those times when the circumstances of life seem to have let me down. Yancey has such an unforgettable, gentle and profound way of revealing the staggering puny-ness of the fist that would shake itself toward God... and all the while he reminds us of the importance of that fist to God. Where is God when we are experiencing our most profound disappointments? Is He blind? Or maybe deaf? Too busy? These are the kind of legitimate questions that this book is addressing. Specifically, the three questions no one asks aloud, and these are: Is God unfair? Is God silent? Is God hidden?<br />I've been reading theological books for over 17 years and I have yet to come across one that addresses these type of questions in a more sensible and Biblically sound way. The modest author would probably be the last person to guarantee some sort of miraculous breakthrough to any reader of his books... so I must do it for him. One thing is for certain... reading Disappointment With God will cause you to consider at least one other angle to questions that were previously seen as one-dimensional and unanswerable. And sometimes it's that one angle or fresh insight that can give us the strength to put our foot down on something that was all the while, (though we knew it not) solid enough to hold us.	2001-08-21

Let me be very clear as to why I give this book a full five stars... it makes Shakespeare's sonnets readily accessible/understandable to the average common reader (which I consider myself to be). This Arden version has become a treasure to me. I have loved W.S.'s sonnets ever since committing #116 (my favorite) to memory a few years ago, but I admit that many of them have left me with one profound thought at the end of the fourteenth line, and that thought is... &quot;huh&quot;? It is truly a sad predicament to be left in such a state of ignorance when Shakespeare is ALWAYS saying something AWESOME! But this book has come closest to a complete cure for me. I am now seldom (if ever) left in the dark by an obscure phrase, line, or context, because the notes on the opposing page are right there to help me through those exact points of difficulty. I unreservedly recommend this affordably priced 3rd Series edited by Katherine Duncan-Jones to any and all sonnet lovers. Let it &quot;give physic&quot; to your ailment.<br />P.S. It begins with an excellent over 100 page introduction and follows the sonnets with an equally great exposition of &quot;A Lover's Complaint&quot;.	2001-08-17

Lewis passed from Atheism through to Theism, and onward to Christianity. Lewis says in the Preface that he knew of no autobiography in which the parts devoted to the earlier years were not by far the most interesting. As such, the entire first half of his own consists of a detailed recollection of childhood and adolescence. The second half is devoted to tracing his adult intellectual interests and particularly to recounting the thought processes which led him in his thirtieth year to a profound conversion experience.<br />Lewis said &quot;How far the story matters to anyone but myself depends on the degree to which others have experienced what I call 'joy'.&quot; By &quot;joy&quot; he was referring to his concept of &quot;sehnsucht&quot; a German word that came closest to the sense of yearning or longing that Lewis felt as early on as six years old. Sehnsucht is an experience difficult to define... it is a longing for an object which is never fully given, coupled with a sense of alienation or displacement from what is desired. Perhaps another way of describing it could be a ceaseless yearning which always points beyond itself. It is this elusive nature of sehnsucht that Lewis had in mind when he (in typical brevity) coined the phrase &quot;our best havings are wantings.&quot; At any rate, sehnsucht or &quot;joy&quot; was such a crucial element in the development of Lewis that we find it here in the title of his life story, and the &quot;surprise&quot; for him was in the gradual realization that joy (as such) was not foreign, contrary to, unaddressed by or otherwise OPPOSED to theism. In fact, Lewis began to see that the most religious writers (Plato, Aeschylus, Virgil, Spenser, Milton, Sir Thomas Browne, Herbert, Donne, Chesterton, MacDonald) were those in whom he found the most kinship in this respect, while those who did not &quot;suffer from religion&quot; (Shaw, Gibbon, Voltaire, Wells, John Stuart Mill) seemed as nourishing as old dishwater. He concluded that &quot;A young man who wishes to remain a sound atheist cannot be too careful of his reading.&quot;<br />Even though the book is never preachy, I believe that the above conclusion applies to any atheist that reads Surprised By Joy through to the end. As with other writings by Lewis, Christianity emerges as something that actually makes a lot of sense. It's not until the last page that Lewis takes this final step, and his theism becomes &quot;not a god, but God.&quot; My title for this review is taken from that last page, where Lewis describes what happens when one accepts the Incarnation.hing as old dishwater.

Perhaps the best way to describe the reciprocal feelings of Leo and Sonya Tolstoy is to quote from their own diary entries. He said: &quot;Nobody will ever understand me.&quot; She said: &quot;He has never taken the trouble to understand me, and does not know me in the least.&quot; It was a marriage that reached to the highest heights, and sank to the lowest depths... over and over again in each direction. And anyone wanting to know more about it should not neglect Shirer's excellent book. By seesawing between the extensive diaries of these two &quot;lovers&quot; Shirer takes the reader right into the eye of the storm... one of the most amazing things about this tumultuous marriage is the extensive and meticulous documentation of the participants. And the author's collation, skillful narrative sense and endnote pages show that he was well acquainted with the extenuating circumstances of these two lives trying to live as one. The latter half of the book is to be commended for its appropriate emphasis on the disastrous influence of Chertkov, the disciple who became the usurper of Tolstoy's most profound devotion. In my opinion, this rift named Chertkov gradually became the uncrossable chasm that irreparably separated Leo and Sonya. During this time, Tolstoy's alliance with his daughter Sasha further alienated husband and wife, and Shirer covers this development with great insight. It's all here... from the peace, courtship, and high hopes of Yasnaya Polyana to the final conflict, rejection and despair of Astapovo.<br />Shirer knew this was to be his last book, and it was. After such a prolific and successful career (14 books and 52 years), to devote his last energies to such a work must imply that he took a special interest in the subject matter. It shows. All of the other books of his I've read have been excellent, and this one is no exception.	2001-08-11

I have just finished this, my first reading of Millay's poetry and I must say I enjoyed it. This anthology makes me want to read more, not less. Her poems convince me that a biography of her life would probably be a worthwhile read also.  The escape she is longing for and never quite leaps into, her obvious disdain for anything artificial or constrained combined with her love and respect for the naturally occurring (freedom)... these are dominant themes. And everywhere, TREES and other growing things! It is amazing how often the trees, fruit, grain, the forest, orchards, mushrooms, moss and even weeds are the things which Millay uses to convey her philosophical reflections. In my opinion, her finest poem (Renascence) written when she was 19 reveals early on this connection she felt between revealed nature and transcendence. &quot;God, I can push the grass apart/And lay my finger on Thy heart!&quot;<br />Colin Falck, in the Introduction comments that Millay was under-appreciated by those who considered her technique too traditional, and her content lacking in intellectual complexity. Did any of these critics read her sonnets I wonder? I agree with Falck's conclusion that &quot;it is time we found a proper place for this intense, thoughtful, and magnificently literate poet.&quot; To the merciless critics I would send Millay's own words... &quot;Cruel of heart, lay down my song./Your reading eyes have done me wrong./Not for you was the pen bitten,/And the mind wrung, and the song written.&quot;	2001-08-09

This is a chilling, moving, important book in which 23 youth and youngsters try to understand the hatred and violence that engulfs their previously peaceful lives. The average age of the writers is around 13-14 years. For many of these children, these excerpts represent their final plea to the surviving world, fully understanding that they will not be a part of that world. Writing became their last and sometimes ONLY form of resistance. I found the very last entry of the unknown brother and sister in the Lodz ghetto to be especially moving. Without access to any other paper, the boy scrawled his diary entries into the margins of an old French novel. After the war was over, a next door neighbor returned to the wreckage of the house, and found the book with the boy's notes in it. If any one of us actually knew any one of those who wrote these diaries... if any one of them were a member of our own families, we would naturally value even one of their retrieved pages far above all of the other books we own, would we not? Well, as I read this book I realized many times that just because I did not know one of these children personally does not really diminish the inherent importance of any one of their pages... these children were all known and loved by their own families and friends. They should have been loved by those who were then acting as their mortal enemies, but sadly, they were not.<br />Some of these entries depict deprivations and describe atrocities that are near impossible for most of us today to imagine. Some would avoid the book on account of this, and that is understandable. We can go to horror novels to be deliberately horrified in a fictional sense, but it seems morbid to turn to non-fiction for the same results. But we must remember that we do not read non-fiction for the same reasons that we read fiction. We read non-fiction, not to dwell on or glory in horror, but to LEARN something about ourselves and others. There is an old saying &quot;To dwell on history is to lose an eye; to ignore it is to lose both of them.&quot; Laurel Holliday has here edited a book which should not be ignored.history is to lose an eye; to ignore it is to lose both of them.&quot; Laurel Holliday has here edited a book which should not be ignored.	2001-08-04

It's now creeping up on 25 years since this book first came out, but the subtitle still seems as valid as it would have been then... a NEW psychology of love, traditional values and spiritual growth. Because Peck speaks so deeply of the needs and longings that cut to the very fundamental elements of human nature, a post-millennial reader (perhaps as yet unborn in the 70's) can still find Peck's &quot;new&quot; insights relevant and even revolutionary. So many of the truths found here along The Road Less Travelled are timelessly true. For instance, how &quot;timely&quot; would be a new worldwide appreciation of Peck's definition of love, which is &quot;the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.&quot; The pages that follow that definition, along with his explanation of how &quot;falling in love is invariably temporary&quot; are in themselves worth the purchase of the book.<br />What kind of reader will NOT like this book? My answer would be, one who needs to think simplistically, and is in denial of the paradox that makes up nearly every day of normal adult life. This reader needs a formula, tends to think one-dimensionally... perhaps when he reads the opening sentence &quot;Life is difficult&quot; this type of person will think &quot;Really? I had no idea!&quot;<br />What kind of reader WILL like this book? One that knows his present day problems may require something beyond &quot;that one thing Grandpa once told me&quot; and someone who is willing to be attentive, to learn, to think multidimensionally. Rather than ramming his head into the sand, this person will respond to the opening sentence &quot;Life is difficult&quot; with something like &quot;No kidding! Tell me about it!&quot; The Road Less Travelled  will not disappoint this second type of reader.	2001-08-01

It is regrettable, and a mystery to me how a book that it is so well-written and important can go out of print, but such is apparently the case with Kati Marton's book &quot;Wallenberg&quot;. Reading this book is something I will never forget. It is the story of Raoul Wallenberg, a young Swedish diplomat whose heroic and selfless efforts saved thousands (some say as many as 100,000) Hungarian Jews from certain death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Budapest's Jews were among the last substantial population threatened by the Nazi's, and in July of 1944 Wallenberg was sent there by the Swedish Foreign Ministry in an effort to rescue the remaining 200,000 Jews from planned deportations. He issued thousands of Swedish Embassy-stamped &quot;Schutzpassen&quot; which were provisional or &quot;protective&quot; passports, granting the bearer not only an exemption from wearing the humiliating yellow star, but (more importantly) extending to them the rights of Swedish citizens, with the eventual intention of being &quot;repatriated&quot; to Sweden. With funds supplied from the War Refugee Board, Wallenberg also secured property which he then converted into &quot;safe houses&quot; for those rescued from deportations. Can you imagine? At times, Wallenberg put himself on the line and pressured SS officials into turning over to his custody &quot;prisoners&quot; who were already on board deportation trains! He then organized a network of hundreds of Jewish agents who managed the distribution of food and medicine to Jews in his shelters.<br />The tragic twist to this story is that after Budapest's liberation, Wallenberg himself was arrested by the Soviets on espionage charges and imprisoned, presumably until the rest of his life, for his fate remains shrouded in mystery. All attempts by his family and government to obtain his release were frustrated. To placate the mass of inquiries, Lubyanka Prison officials gave a date of Wallenberg's alleged death as being July 17, 1947. The end of Marton's book goes into many reasons why such an ending to Wallenberg's life seems suspicious. She explains how that Wallenberg was &quot;quite possibly the Soviet's most important prisoner. His name and his legend were too powerful to release.&quot; A free Wallenberg would be a &quot;living indictment&quot; and would have presented a dangerous competition to the Communist party's most jealously guarded possessions: legitimacy and power.<br />The author says in chapter 10: &quot;Wallenberg was imbued with a conviction that anything was within reach, any goal could be met if one just applied oneself, and all of one's God-given gifts to its fulfillment.&quot; Here where I live in the capital city of Canada there is a Raoul Wallenberg Park... and whenever I drive by it I am powerfully reminded of the importance of remembering this hero of humanity, who, in the name of the civilized world sacrificed his own freedom in a fight to hold the uncivilized portion of that world accountable to the last.of Marton's book goes into many reasons why such an ending to Wallenberg's life seems suspicious.

In the Table Of Contents I pencil in an asterisk before the titles of poems that I especially enjoyed. I find that this helps me to quickly relocate special poems later when I want to re-read them. In my copy of Sandburg's &quot;Chicago Poems&quot; there are many asterisks. I think that one of the things that appeal to me about these particular series of poems is their &quot;urbanity&quot;. As the title suggests, these are often poems about &quot;city&quot;... about the &quot;cosmopolis&quot;. Sandburg had a way of animating concrete and asphalt, and making us aware of the inner life of things that millions of us urbanites walk past each day. In one of my favorites entitled &quot;Skyscraper&quot; he says &quot;It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and out all day that give the building a soul of dreams and thoughts and memories.&quot; And it ends beautifully with &quot;By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars and has a soul.&quot; It is as though if any of Sandburg's Chicago Poems were to just remain silent for a moment, we would hear the faint night-time &quot;humming and thrumming&quot; of &quot;a copper wire slung in the air.&quot; (cf. his Under A Telephone Pole).<br />He writes with a solemnity that avoids being morose, which is refreshing. But take note... &quot;you will be thwarted every time, you try to catch a Sandburg rhyme.&quot; (they never rhyme). As for metre, his poems are in a free-verse very much reminiscent of Walt Whitman. The perfect poetry to read while feeding the pigeons, or otherwise commuting to and from the park.	2001-07-23

I, a reluctant grown-up, confess that my life has been enriched through my meeting of these four Edwardian animal bachelors. This is a classic that should be read TO or BY anyone YOUNG or OLD enough to have an imagination! Grahame created a wonderful pastoral world where the River-Bankers (consisting of Rat, Mole, Badger, and Otter) and their friends form a close-knit community of leisured landowners who observe an extremely strict code of responsible behavior. Uh... then there's Toad. Toad, although he is one of the River-Bankers, continually distinguishes himself as one who is conceited and irresponsible, a spendthrift megalomaniac who disgraces his friends by even landing himself in jail. Because of his incarceration, the stoats and weasels of the Wild Wood attempt to invade Toad's ancestral home, and this threat to River-bank society is the one thing that can rouse Badger out of his cosy retirement. Together, he and Rat lecture Toad with the inflexible moral fervor of Alcoholics Anonymous. Will Toad ever come to a sincere repentance and reform? Well, that is the question.<br />Throughout the whole book there runs the leitmotif which may be roughly described as the conflict between Us and Them - or more specifically, the attempts made by Grahame's ideal rural society to defend itself against encroachment. I personally believe that this subtle theme can be a great vehicle to instill in the young reader (or listener) a sense of the importance of peaceful living, and of how our actions affect others. Adult readers will definitely have lived long enough to clearly recognize themselves in one of the main animal characters. Alas... I am undoubtedly Toad!	2001-07-21

Thirty-nine years later, after writing so many other fabulous books he said of King, Queen, Knave &quot;of all my novels this bright brute is the gayest.&quot; By this he meant that he enjoyed contemplating its &quot;rapturous composition&quot; and reminiscing of how the idea for it first came to him on the coastal sands of Pomerania. The book maintained a special place in his heart. The theme is in many ways similar to Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary, as Nabokov himself admits in the Foreword to the revised English version. I love those other books dearly, but Nabokov's contains several twists and turns that are even more dramatic and less likely for the reader to detect ahead of time than either of those other classic husband/wife/paramour triangle stories.<br />The setting here is Berlin in the 1920's. The young, unsophisticated Franz arrives on the doorstep of his rich uncle Dreyer with hopes of securing a job in his department store. He gets the job and repays Dreyer's magnanimity by falling for his beautiful wife Martha. (Franz's aunt? Hello!) Martha's seduction of Franz seems to be motivated by something at least bordering on pure boredom, but at any rate, the triangle is set. Dreyer, oblivious to this development, plods on with his money-making schemes and inventions/diversions. Martha, in a departure from the more suicidal natures of Anna K. or Emma B. decides rather to begin clumsily plotting her husband's death so that she and Franz will be able to live happily ever after on his money. But things are not so easy in anything Nabokovian are they? Well, things don't work out the way they're supposed to here either, and that's all I will say. Far be it from me to unravel a rope the Nabokov has so skillfully stretched tight. By the end of this story Franz's conscience lies in tatters, and Martha is _____!<br />The only reason I don't give the book a perfect 5 stars is because the very ending left me a tad bewildered.

Once I was into it, I could barely put it down long enough to tend to other necessary things... like eating and sleeping. I lost weight! I became skittish! And not since reading War and Peace have I felt so riveted to a story. Uris digs down deep into the soul-stretching time of Nazi terror in Eastern Europe, a period of history I am always interested in learning more about. His book is filled with non-stop action, it is tense, it is nerve-wracking. There is a scene where several of the ghetto prisoners are in a desperate scramble along an angled rooftop, and I felt that if one of them had slipped I surely would've fallen off my chair and landed with him amidst the ravenous guards in the courtyard down below. Their reward for NOT falling is to be trapped end-to-end along a single beam in the rafters of that same rooftop for more than a day and a night, unable to make a sound beyond breathing, while rats knaw on them, and the guards furiously stomp about just above their heads, longing to exterminate them as though they were rabid animals. While plumbing these almost unbelievable (but sadly, too true) depths of human cruelty, hatred, and injustice against fellow man, this book also scales the heights of human courage, loyalty, and dignity. And running throughout Mila 18 is the interwoven story of romantic love during perilous times. Because of the peril, some loves are lost and they die; others are found, they are born and they grow.<br />As the resistance forces in the ghetto begin to realize that they cannot stave off the Nazi onslaught indefinitely, the desperation increases... and one man on the other side of the wall (the reporter Christopher de Monti) willingly enters the ghetto. The woman he loves is there. But even beyond this, ever since the Nazi Horst von Epp ridiculed Chris by telling him that he represented &quot;all the moralists in the world who have condoned genocide by the conspiracy of silence&quot; Chris has known that he has a historical role to play inside the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto. He risks his life to become the one who will retrieve and publish the meticulous hidden journals that have been kept up by the chronicler Alexander Brandel. In this he succeeds.<br />It is a remarkable fact of history that while all of Poland fell to the Nazi power in less than a month, this rabble army of Jewish resistance within the ghetto (lacking any decent weapon) held at bay the world's mightiest military power for 42 days and 42 nights! In the end, there are precious few survivors of Mila 18. But this is not a book about death.

He risks his life to become the one who will retrieve and publish the meticulous hidden journals that have been kept up by the chronicler Alexander Brandel. In this he succeeds.<br />It is a remarkable fact of history that while all of Poland fell to the Nazi power in less than a month, this rabble army of Jewish resistance within the ghetto (lacking any decent weapon) held at bay the world's mightiest military power for 42 days and 42 nights!

It took me a couple pages to catch on to the way Davies constructed this novel. It's written in six sets of chapter couplets, which made for a really unique storyline. Two narrators take their turn in describing the current thread of the story... one is the beautiful and brilliant student of Comparative Literature, Maria Theotoky. The other is Professor Simon Darcourt who teaches New Testament Greek. He is not the only professor of the University who acknowledges that Maria is among the &quot;scholarly elect&quot;... Darcourt becomes enamored of her, but she has already become the special pet of Professor Hollier. His impetuous seduction of her leaves her a bit bewildered, for rather than the continued intimacy she desires from this man she greatly admires, he becomes distant. When his eccentric longtime friend John Parlabane returns for a visit (which never ends) the relationship between Maria and Hollier becomes even more confined to that of professor - research assistant.<br />Meanwhile, a wealthy art collecter (Arthur Cornish) passes away and leaves his estate to be settled by three executors, all of them being professors at the University. They are Hollier, Darcourt, and a true nut by the name of McVarish. As they go through the mountain of Cornish's priceless items, Hollier becomes obsessed with the recovery of a manuscript of Rabelais which he is convinced McVarish once purloined and never returned. McVarish denies ever having borrowed the papers from Cornish, but Hollier will not give up. His obsession is motivated and fueled by the fact that the authentic document would greatly advance Maria in her own doctoral work on Rabelais, and he longs to do something tangible that will atone for his earlier seduction of her.<br />Without ruining some of the comic turns in this story for those who haven't read it, I will hint that it is ingenious how Davies knits the eccentricity of Parlabane and the extra-curricular nightime perversions of McVarish together in a way that becomes the ONLY way the above dilemna (of the missing manuscript) could be solved. And not before Hollier himself has degenerated into a superstitious nut in his own right.

I picked up The Illuminati because I am very interested in eschatology or what is more commonly referred to as the &quot;end times&quot; and more specifically, my particular interest lies in a Biblical interpretation of the end of those times. And I love good fiction. And also I have read elsewhere about the existence of an international group of powerful elite policy-makers known as The Illuminati, so I wanted to learn more about them. But this book has seriously let me down on all three counts. Even the title is misleading because it does not really focus on any intelligent discussion of the Illuminati. Seriously, you would be hard-pressed to find a book built upon a more weakly constructed storyline, cookie-cutter characters, and all caving in upon itself with the worst dialogue that I think I have ever come across. If a wall of water 60 feet high were about to roll on top of two of Burkett's characters, I'm sure they would turn to each other, grasp hands, and say... &quot;Quick, let's run!&quot;<br />Well, it's unfortunate, because he has chosen a very serious topic to write a poor book about. It will make many people take the real issues that are here MIS-represented less seriously. Burkett has written tremendous (and I think the very best) books about personal financial management, but The Illuminati proves that fiction is a genre wherein he ought not to have strayed.	2001-07-08

Peer Gynt first appears to me as this self-centered youth who cares only for himself and the satisfaction of his impulses and whims at any cost. He is the quick non-thinker, who leaves a life of relative conventionality to roam as a dissolute wanderer. He is indeed all of these things, but all the while his &quot;self&quot; is not &quot;centered&quot;. At the end of his adventures as a libertine, the grey-bearded Peer Gynt is at a cross-roads, and he asks the character of the Button Moulder this question: &quot;What, after all, is this being one's self?&quot; The Button Moulder replies that being one's self means slaying one's Self, and furthermore &quot;observing the Master's intentions in all things.&quot; Peer Gynt contemplates this... restraint and delayed gratification have never been manageable themes with him. In my opinion, this whole idea of the search for the &quot;self&quot; is what Peer Gynt is all about. At the very final crossroads he is redeemed by the undeserved forgiveness and love of Solvieg, the woman he has once abandoned... this scene being a beautiful picture of the grace and love of God that is available to the Peer Gynt in every reader.<br />Ibsen originally wrote Peer Gynt as a poem, and therefore we lose the Norwegian rhyme and metre in any English translation. To compensate if at all possible, I suggest reading the play while listening to the incidental music of Edvard Grieg, specifically composed to accompany the live performance of Peer Gynt. (Note: My review is based on the translation by Peter Watts).	2001-07-03

No matter what topic Scott Peck turns his attentions upon, I find that an honest and sensitive reading of him always results in a clearer understanding of myself and those around me. This book is no exception, the mirror is once again trained inwards and outwards. Here, he is focusing on the problem of EVIL... the first problem of which is a definition. In our value-free type of society, it is hard to reach a consensus on what evil exactly IS! Yet we are all aware of it when we encounter it. Peck says that it is &quot;that force, residing either inside or outside of human beings, that seeks to kill life or liveliness.&quot; He argues (from a wealth of clinical experience and personally handled case-studies) that evil is not only a psychiatric disorder, but ought to be labelled for what it is... an ILLNESS. And as an illness, it can be cured, but not until it is recognized as such by those who deal with it within the domain of their professional responsibilities.<br />Citing numerous real-life examples Peck illustrates that often those who most readily identify others as evil are themselves most in need of correction. They are the ones who should be the patients, and this situation exists because one of the dominant characteristics of the evil personality is consistent scapegoating behavior. The following summary (from chapter 3) of the evil personality is typical of Peck's insightful analysis and conclusions that so often cause us to re-think some of our uncooked presuppositions... He says that, &quot;in addition to the abrogation of responsibility that characterizes all personality disorders, this one would specifically be distinguished by: a) consistent destructive, scapegoating behavior, which may often be quite subtle; b) excessive, albeit usually covert, intolerance to criticism and other forms of narcissistic injury; c) pronounced concern with a public image and self-image of respectability, contributing to a stability of life-style but also to pretensiousness and denial of hateful feelings or vengeful motives; d) intellectual deviousness, with an increased likelihood of a mild schizophrenic disturbance of thinking at times of stress.&quot;<br />His chapter on possession and exorcism is totally fascinating. Peck's book lifts the veil on a lot of things we would all rather not look at... but I've read it a couple of times now and intend to re-read it yet again because, as the sub-title suggests, there is hope... but only in awareness.and denial of hateful feelings or vengeful motives; d) intellectual deviousness, with an increased likelihood of a mild schizophrenic disturbance of thinking at times of stress.&quot;<br />His chapter on possession and exorcism is totally fascinating.

Verily verily, the Christian Bible is very clear on the foundational importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Regardless of personal interpretation, Scriptures such as Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 15:14 clearly state that for the believer, Jesus' resurrection from the dead must be regarded as a non-optional issue, and must be personally subscribed to doctrinally. Obviously, this can be an affront to the modern intellect and have the potential to collide with  our reasoning faculties and idea of intelligence. In fact, that was exactly the case for English journalist Frank Morison when he began to write &quot;Who Moved The Stone&quot; over 70 years ago. As a skeptic, he set out to prove that the story of Christ's resurrection was only a fabricated myth... what he found, however, was a seamless validity in the biblical and extra-historical record.<br />I call this book a &quot;study&quot;. By that I mean that it is not a light read, and one ought to follow up on all Biblical references and make notes as one goes along. I filled up half a notebook with detailed timelines, summaries, and diagrams, with the end result being that my initial understanding of the resurrection was further strengthened in a way that is impossible to exaggerate. For me, one of the greatest testimonies to the FACT of the resurrection has always been that the authorities at the time did not dispel the &quot;myth&quot; by simply displaying the crucified body. In the early stages of the apostles' preaching, when the church was gaining converts left and right... all the authorities would've had to do was PRODUCE the body of Jesus! Why didn't they do it? Read Morison's book with even a half-open mind and I believe that you will finish it in agreement with me... that they DID not, because they COULD not.	2001-06-26

I happened upon the poetry of Rupert Brooke in an old old (truly ancient) used bookstore in a serene corner of Vancouver Island... something about this aged, sepia-colored, hardcover beauty of a book made me feel it had been abandoned by someone else and left there especially for me to find. The rest of the day I was on the beach with it, and each new page further convinced me that I had stumbled upon greatness. Each phrase carried a thoughtful hush along with it, and I felt that to breathe was an interruption. Time and time again I have been brought back to the poetry of Brooke, and this collection has become one of my treasures. Someone abandoned it for me to find, and yet it has become something I would run back into a burning house to retrieve.<br />These are brief poems about love and longing, doubts, serenity,  nature and goodness, frivolity, victory and jealousy, and stirring wartime sonnets that express a noble idealism in the face of death. These latter are grouped under the author's title of &quot;1914&quot; and are his most well-known series, perhaps not only because of their perfection, but also because of their prophetic nature. Brooke lived a brief but eventful life (1887-1915). With the outbreak of World War I he was commissioned in England's Royal Navy, and took part in a disastrous expedition at Antwerp which ended in retreat. At the age of 27, he died from blood-poisoning on board a French hospital ship off the coast of Skyros, Greece. He was buried at night, by torchlight, in an olive grove about a mile inland. Reportedly, if you go there you will find a little wooden cross with just his name and the date of his birth and his death marked on it in black. The fifth poem (entitled The Soldier) in Brooke's sonnet sequence begins... &quot;If I should die, think only this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign field that is for ever England.&quot;	2001-06-21

Who else but R. Davies could kill off his main character in the first sentence, and then chronicle the experiences of the disembodied ghost for over three and a half hundred pages... and yet keep it increasingly interesting? He does it. Incidentally, Davies believed that physical death would not spell the annihilation of the animating spirit of man (a belief to which I am in full agreement). He once speculated about his own afterlife by saying: &quot;I haven't any notion of what I might be or whether I'll be capable of recognizing what I've been, or perhaps even what I am, but I expect that I shall be something.&quot; Murther is a really interesting fictional account of what that &quot;something&quot; might be like.<br />The moment that Connor Gilmartin is struck dead in his own bedroom by his wife's lover, he finds that he is still alive! Perhaps even more alive than he has ever been; he is in a state that the opening chapter calls &quot;roughly translated&quot;. He's a ghost; a walking spirit. This new state is fraught with all manner of possibilities and limitations. For one thing, his powers of awareness and observation are heightened, but he is unable to communicate with any of the living, no matter how he jumps up and down or shouts in their ear. And for that typically Robertsonian twist, the great author borrows an idea from the Bhagavad Gita which states that after death one maintains a connection with what one was thinking about at the moment of death. (It behoved a man to be concerned with what he was thinking of as he died)! So... what was Connor Gilmartin thinking of at that moment? Well, he was processing the fact that he had just caught his wife involved with a man (a co-worker) whom he particularly despised for many reasons, and secondly, he was thinking of a particular work-related problem concerning an upcoming Film Festival in Toronto to which this man (his murderer) was vying with him for position as lead writer. Now Connor is dead, aware of his wife's duplicity in covering up the murder but unable to vindicate himself in any way, and furthermore he is bound inextricably to his own murderer who attends the Film Festval as lead writer in his place. In a surreal twist, at the Film Festival, what Connor views on the screen is not what the others are seeing, but rather it is a documentary of his own ancestry... (one's life flashes before one's eyes??) He is seeing something wholly personal. After the festival he is instantly translated back to see how his wife is winding up her affairs... he sees that she has actually found a way to profit from his untimely demise. This story was great right to the end... with the disclaimer that in my opinion it is important to remember it as a fanciful rather than a literal view of what happens after your last breath. He raises a lot of interesting things to think about though. Not the best example of Davies' work, but still worthy of four and a half stars to the best Canadian writer ever.writer.

Steinbeck proposed four potential titles before he settled upon East of Eden. I looked up the phrase in the Bible and found that it appears twice in Genesis (3:24 and 4:16); both accounts denoting an instance where man experienced a separation from the blessings that God had intended for him. I think this is very significant as we consider what Steinbeck was writing about in his allegorical novel. He says in Chapter 34, &quot;We have only one story. All novels, all poetry are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal.&quot;<br />The contest is in ourselves! Surely this is what East Of Eden teaches us while we enjoy the sweeping story, so well told. It is deadly realistic, as beautiful and revolting as is the actual human potentiality for good and evil. With brilliance, Steinbeck contrasts a sea of temperaments in these characters, and shows us all the while that life is much more than the choices we make, but it is never any less. Adam Trask is the representative of good intentions, of a conscience which responds to the good as the eye responds to the light. Samuel Hamilton also represents a similar (perhaps even more well-honed) goodness. But Adam is the one who has been deceived, by a force every bit as essentially evil as Eden's serpent in the tree. This is Cathy, a character so reprobate that evil isn't something she does, it's something she IS that INFECTS everything she does! After abandoning her twin boys Caleb and Aron to the care of their father (Adam) she returns to her life of debauchery. The boys grow up unaware that their mother is a serial murderer and owner of a whorehouse. Because Adam never fully recovers from his shame, his loss and disillusionment, he is not able to convey the appropriate unconditional (equally distributed) love to his sons. This leads to jealousy and rivalry in his boys, and is a generational replica of his own childhood.<br />How can one summarize such a vast epic story? But for me, one of the most powerful scenes and a turning point (perhaps the denouement?) is when Caleb finally sees his mother in all her non-glory, and says to her... &quot;I don't have to be you.&quot; The reader can notice that really no-one is the same from this point on, there is a real unravelling here. For Cathy (now &quot;Kate&quot;), this marks the beginning of her own self-destruction, the awakening of her own conscience. She's been defied!<br />One of the tendencies of the modern age is to deny radically the absolute nature of conscience, reducing it to a matter of temperament, or to a product of history or social environment. But East of Eden plows right through a tangle of sociological, psychological, and historical half-truths to the elementray fact: CONSCIENCE EXISTS.dhood.<br />How can one summarize such a vast epic story?

In a housing development called Battle Hill just north of London, a local drama group is staging a play written by the distinguished playwright/poet Peter Stanhope. There is a brutal history of ancient bloodshed that seems to hover over this geographical spot, presenting itself as a sort of pressure canopy over the participants in the play. Of these, Pauline Anstruther is particularly bedevilled (literally obsessed with personal fear), and becomes, in many ways, the central focus of the book. She is the only character who seems to understand what Stanhope has set out to accomplish through his play. On the site of Battle Hill, an ancestor of Pauline's was burnt at the stake as a heretic under the persecutions of Mary Tudor. Whether real or imagined (does it matter?) Pauline is pursued by a &quot;doppelganger&quot;, a type of ghost which seems to be yourself dogging your own footsteps. It always appears when she is alone and it stays at a considerable distance. Her fear centers around the question of what will happen to her when it finally catches up to her, and perhaps even touches her. She is relentlessly pursued.<br />Stanhope, seeing and understanding her struggle, begins to instruct her in the ways of &quot;substitution&quot;. By this he means that one can, by mutual consent, take on the fears, pains or BURDENS of another. Honestly, when I read of this in Chapter 6, I was overwhelmed by the revelation of it all... what to me has become a very profound, albeit difficult truth. The concept of the deliberate agreement and intention for one person to carry the other's burden, just as one might a parcel. Stanhope takes our feeble understanding of &quot;bearing one another's burdens&quot; up a notch or two... or three. He literally offers to take Pauline's burden of fear upon himself, by suggesting to her &quot;...what can be easier than for me to carry a little while a burden that isn't mine?&quot; She, as can be expected, is completely confused, so he continues to explain: &quot;To bear a burden is precisely to carry it instead of. If you're still carrying yours, I'm not carrying it for you - however sympathetic I may be. It's a fact of experience. If you give a weight to me, you can't be carrying it yourself; all I'm asking you to do is to notice that blazing truth.&quot;<br />He instructs her that the next time she is alone and afraid, she is to put HIM in her place and let HIM be afraid FOR her. He, in turn, takes it upon himself to BE afraid in her stead. He does this by visualizing the situation that she is frightened of and opening himself fully to the negative emotions she might feel as a consequence, but because he is not embroiled within the situation by weight of past emotional connotations, it is an altogether lighter burden for him to bear. It works. She receives a powerful deliverance as a result of his sacrifice, and further finds that the doppelganger that she has run from for all those years, turned out to be no great horror, but her ideal spiritual self. After reading chapter 6, I immediately re-read Isaiah chapter 53 in the Bible and realized that Williams' ideas were not entirely original, but were definitely communicated in a new and beautiful way that emphasizes the responsibility we have one to another.<br />There are so many other characters and situations about this book that one could discuss, but for brevity I wanted to focus on that which meant the most to me personally.

Well, this is one of my favorite books ever, and that is why I've read it over and over so many times. To say that it is &quot;just for kids&quot; is like saying that ice cream or watermelon is just for kids. Blasphemy! It is true that Tolkien intended his story for young readers to enjoy, as is evident in the fact that hardly a page goes by in which the narrator does not address children in the first person singular, but the story is never &quot;childish&quot; (in my opinion). Any child reading this story will feel elevated to being at one level with the (adult) narrator. I think it is significant that Tolkien makes the hobbits beardless and &quot;shy of the Big People&quot; and their stature to be &quot;about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves.&quot; They tend to &quot;disappear quietly and quickly when large and stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.&quot; The misgivings that Bilbo has as he is swept off on this adventure, are the misgivings that any child would have... and the fact that he overcomes those fears, learns to live with a determined initiative, becomes a true leader, and emerges a hero in the end is a great lesson for young and old alike.<br />The Hobbit is self-contained, and  essentially independent of the three-volume Lord Of The Rings, which, in my opinion is a far more graver sort of quest... perhaps less accessible to the younger reader. It is not necessary to read the Hobbit in order to understand The Lord of The Rings, but The Hobbit serves as a quarry of important themes for the larger work.<br />The Hobbit reminds me of something C.S. Lewis (a friend of Tolkien's) once said of children's literature: &quot;No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty...&quot; The Hobbit surely fulfills this criteria, and so I believe you will be smiling at the end of this book regardless of whether, in doing so, you're displaying baby teeth or dentures at the time.of whether, in doing so, you're displaying baby teeth or dentures at the time.	2001-06-11

I make it a point to never give up on a book till I've read the last page, but this book finished me long before I finished it! And I DID finish it, but I must confess that I just didn't GET what it was saying, and so I just can't recommend it to the average reader out there. Maybe if you are a political scientist or something, you will know what is going on here (allegorically and all)... and maybe I am just the wrong reader for this genre altogether, and there is nothing I dislike more than the feeling of handing a negative review to a writer who, in other respects, I greatly admire. I think it is important though for potential readers to not base their acquiring of this book on an admiration of Chesterton's other works (ie., the Father Brown stories, or his outright theological stuff). This book is nothing like those other writings which I dearly love. The Man Who Was Thursday is about this poet/detective (Gabriel Syme) who is hired to perform a clandestine infiltration of a group of anarchists, each named for a day of the week and all bent on destroying the world. I was lost, lost, lost. Granted, greater minds than mine will not agree, but have mercy, I am arguing from, and for, the commoner.

Tolstoy once wrote in his diary &quot;Nobody will ever understand me.&quot; I can imagine that many biographers have been tormented by those words as they tried to compile and collate information about the extraordinary life of this great &quot;lion&quot; of writers. Troyat has done a remarkable job of this daunting monumental task, and his book ought to be considered essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the lifelong inner struggle that seemed to fuel the creative genius of Leo Tolstoy. As others have commented, it truly does read with the pace and interest of a sweeping epic novel, and there doesn't seem to be any possible chronological gap that could be missing. It's all here: Tolstoy's ancestry, the early loss of both his parents, his military youth in the Caucasus, his bouts with profligacy, his fickle literary friendships, his blunderous courtship and tumultuous (to put it mildly) marriage with Sofya Behrs... and all of his day-to-day glaring contradictory theories that remind us of Herzen's assessment of him: &quot;He oversteps the limits. His brain does not take time to digest the impressions it absorbs.&quot; Everything is here: his vacillating acceptance and rejection of earthly comfort, his never ending search for some form of self-imposed suffering to atone for his affluence, his frustrating envy of all who had the good fortune of being unfortunate... his ultimate rejection of a fortune.<br />In my opinion, Leo Tolstoy was the greatest writer the world has ever produced. I've read other biographies of him, and consider Troyat's to be the best for many reasons, not the least of which is his selective restraint with detail. It's obvious that he probably read upwards of a million pages in order to give us this 900, and the finished product is never tedious. His look at Tolstoy is unbiased, he does not try to canonize him. It takes a great man to have every stone of his life upturned like this, and yet emerge as a hero. Tolstoy does!	2001-06-03

Those are very important words, and they remind me of the main reason that I tend to hate books about financial planning... they usually make me feel as if the old maxim that says &quot;the best time to plant an oak tree is twenty years ago&quot; was coined by someone just after they reviewed my own financial portfolio! But this book is so different... it is everywhere ENCOURAGING, and ANYONE (at any age) can begin to benefit from its principles. In a light, humorous, and UN-technical way, Chilton's fictional &quot;wealthy barber&quot; Roy lets us in on some very basic but dynamic financial advice, such as:<br />- invest 10% of all you make for long-term growth. (ie. mutual funds). - pay yourself first. (have the money come right out of your bank account before you get a chance to spend it). - take advantage of the benefits of dollar-cost averaging.<br />He goes on to talk about life insurance, wills, real estate, income tax, and of course... the &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot; the magic of compound interest, which is, simply put, interest on principal and interest, not just simple interest on principal. Listen to this scenario (from ch.4): &quot;If you had started putting $30.00 a month away, the equivalent of a dollar a day, at age eighteen and you continued until age sixty-five, averaging a 15% annual return, how much would you end up with?&quot; Someone in the story hazards a guess and says $70,000? The barber tells him the correct answer... (are you ready for this)? It is approximately $2,000,000. It's enough to make an oak tree turn into a weeping willow! Nobody told me about this stuff when I was an acorn!<br />This is why I believe that this easy-to-read book about the path to future self-reliance/prosperity should be MANDATORY reading in high-school... there should be a course called Wealthy-Barberism. A great gift for a graduate, and written in a lively engaging way that will encourage the rest of us that it is never too late to start using our common cents!that will encourage the rest of us that it is never too late to start using our common cents!	2001-05-28

He was a marvelous writer who served up 5-star books like Judith Hearne, The Luck of Ginger Coffey, The Statement, and my favorite of all, An Answer From Limbo... among many others. So, I would not consider The Magician's Wife to be the best introduction to him.<br />If a reader is maybe terribly interested in the actual story of the subjugation and conquest of Algeria by France in 1857, this book may provide sort of a fictional backdrop to those events, but none of the main characters grabbed me as being admirable (which means nothing as concerning a review) or memorable (which DOES mean something as concerning a review). I will grant the author this: he made me loathe the religious chicanery of the fanatical patriot magician Lambert, and he made me sympathetic towards the Arab Muslims upon whom Lambert was attempting to foist his spiritual supremacy hooey! And since I see this as the author's intention in the story (strengthened by Lambert's wife Emmeline's later disillusionment in the cause) I give it the three stars.<br />But seriously though, if you only have room for ONE Brian Moore book in your vacation luggage... I say, &quot;pick a book... any other book!&quot;	2001-05-21

I hadn't heard of Niall Williams before that moment. I sat down with the book and was immediately captivated by the somber seriousness of the story and the lyrical beauty of the author's style. And I left with the book, in more ways than one.<br />If predominant weather conditions are an indication of a story's tone, then this is definitely one of fog, mist, blustery wind and slanting rain rather than clear visibility, blue skies, sun, and gentle breezes. The three protagonists (Philip, Stephen, and Gabriella) all struggle with the emptiness of loss in their own ways; they all show us the depths of what it is to mourn, grieve, and battle resentment. But the graceful beauty of the story is that in the ever-burgeoning relationship of Stephen and Gabriella we learn that true love not only displaces the emptiness... it HEALS it. It is something learned only in retrospect, neither is aware of what is happening to them at the time. At their mature age, they are like a densely populated city: nothing new can be built, in its heart, without something else being torn down. But Williams lets love do its work, and, as we read in Part 2, ch.3: &quot;When something of great size moves into the heart it dislodges all else...&quot;<br />Virtually all of the peripheral characters in this story possess an intuitiveness that is lacking in Stephen and Gabriella. (Read it with this in mind and see see if you don't agree). It's as though everyone else knows more about them than they themselves do... it's a clever device employed by Williams, and it puts the MYSTERY in the MIST that these two are always walking through. It effectively gives the impression that the world is truly revolving around them... as though the ferryman's only purpose for existence is to shuttle them across the Shannon. I enjoyed all this romanticism. For staunch realists, this will not do; for hopeless romantics, they will see it as a canonization of their every longing. Admittedly, I was somewhere in the middle.<br />Ireland's windswept coastline and verdant interior form the perfect backdrop for all that Williams wants to say. Nature is everywhere significant. Two scenes are especially memorable for me: Stephen's solitary walk on the beach at Spanish Point where he shouts out into the wind for only the gulls and the sea to hear... &quot;I'm in love with that woman.&quot; The other scene, equally bursting with the cooperation of nature, is earlier on, when the deer discovers Gabriella in the forest. Williams points to these instances as the beginning of a healing process in each person, the difference being primarily that Gabriella's &quot;moment&quot; is more individually motivated... she has not even met Stephen yet! This is significant, and is consistent with the progression of the story... true DEVOTION to the OTHER comes much easier (and sooner) for Stephen than for Gabriella.<br />This book wonderfully reminds us that what is most loved is most precious. It lifts the veil, if for a moment, on the sheer mystery... the vulnerability of love, and the seeming indifference with which tragedy is capable of striking that which is most precious.ery longing.

The first sentence in the author's preface says it all... &quot;There was absolutely nothing ordinary about Joy Davidman Lewis.&quot; This book is a testament to the truth of that statement, and is unique in its ability to show us so much about Joy Davidman prior to (or besides) her relationship with C.S. Lewis. In fact, it is only towards the mid-section of the book that she even meets Lewis for the first time in the dining room of the Eastgate Hotel, across from Magdalen College in Oxford. Dorsett does an unparalleled ORIGINAL job of documenting Joy's early family life in New York. (95% of the biography is based upon hitherto untapped primary sources). Growing up in a family where religion was at once respected and deplored, we see her unfold as a reluctant Jewess, an atheist, a militant communist, Christian convert, gifted writer/poet and screenwriter, mother and divorcee. She was a many-splendored critical thinker, and Lewis's brother Warnie tells us that &quot;she liked walking, and she liked beer.&quot;<br />In her search for critical truth, Joy was greatly affected by the writings of Lewis (in particular, his Great Divorce, Miracles, and Screwtape Letters) and in the early spring of 1946 she experienced a profound conversion to Christianity. In the midst of a tumultuous and intolerable marriage, she and her two sons sailed for Liverpool from New York in August of 1952. In early September, Joy met Lewis. Anyone who has seen the Hollywood movie &quot;Shadowlands&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger will remember the portrayal of this initial meeting, and the relationship that followed. It must be said that the movie, though excellent, is grossly inaccurate of their actual story in many ways. For the clearest picture of one of the most heart-rending love stories of our modern age, you can do no better than to sit down with this book by Dorsett. It is an extraordinary account of two lives that were anything but ordinary.	2001-05-10

This is the eighth Scott Peck book I have read... and he has yet to bore or disappoint me! In Chapter 13, he calls himself an &quot;evangelist of integration&quot; referring to his interest in bringing together the fields of general science, psychology, and theology in his writings. With this book we may add history, archaeology, and philosophy to the mix. By his own admission, he is a man &quot;driven to integrate everything that is properly interrelated.&quot; As the subtitle of In Search Of Stones would suggest, this is exactly what he is attempting to do here in this 21-day journal-like account of a trip through Wales, Scotland and England with his wife Lily in June of 1992. To me, it is truly fascinating how their trip turns into an obsession of locating and studying the megalithic standing-stones that are everywhere scattered along their experience. Each day is a new chapter, respectively focusing on the following topics: Reason, Romance, Addiction, Holiness, Changing, Religion, Aging, Parenthood, Money, Death, Pilgrimage, Gratitude, Peace, Adventure, Consideration, Space, Time, Art, Integration, Despair.<br />One does not have to always agree on every Peck-point (ie., in ch.10, he rejects the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body) to yet find him challenging, and yes... inspirational. He shares his thoughts in a way that never comes across ex cathedra, and the reader is never judged, but is rather, allowed to judge. I love his knack for summary statements... for instance, mental health is &quot;an ongoing process of dedication to reality at all costs.&quot; Contemplation is &quot;a lifestyle dedicated to maximum awareness.&quot; Salvation is &quot;an ongoing process of becoming increasingly conscious.&quot; Of money, he says that &quot;enough of it is not enough, at least not when we are chasing after the illusion of total security.&quot; He says that &quot;death is probably the most important fact of life,&quot; and that &quot;a grateful heart is one of the prerequisites for being a genuine Christian.&quot; He suggests that &quot;laziness&quot; might be the essence of what we call original sin. (Laziness not as physical lethargy, but mental, emotional and spiritual inertia). Peck says that &quot;courage is not the absence of fear but the capacity to go ahead in the very direction of which you are afraid.&quot;<br />I read this book while at a spiritual retreat and found it very inspirational, thought-provoking, and as metaphysically challenging as anything he's written, including his &quot;In Heaven As On Earth.&quot; This is as close as he's come so far to an actual autobiography... here we are not on the couch in his office, but we are rattling along with him down bumpy backroads, being disappointed at yet another less-than-3-star accommodation... and peering into every farmer's field for perhaps another serendipitous adventure with the stones.

I thought only cats were supposed to have nine lives, but this donkey has at least that many. This book is great fun, I couldn't put it down for too long, and it is incredible that something written so long ago (18 centuries?) can be so accessible, captivating, and hilarious to a modern reader. The events in The Golden Ass resemble the ribald, bawdy exuberance of the Decameron, and no doubt Boccaccio was somewhat inspired by the writings of Apuleius. According to the introduction, the adjective &quot;golden&quot; in the title implies &quot;the ass par excellence&quot; or &quot;the best of all stories about an ass.&quot; The story follows the misadventures of Lucius, an enterprising young man who gets far too close to the world of magic, is transformed into a donkey and is constantly thwarted in his attempt to procure the antidote to his assness. It's human mind trapped in donkey bawdy! Totally imaginative, classically written, hilarious fun. As a writer, Apuleius was MILLENNIUMS ahead of his time! (Note: my review is based on the Robert Graves translation, rather than the William Adlington).	2001-04-25

Written as a sort of posthumous confession, Portrait Of A Marriage is the TRUE story of a forty-nine year marriage that survived constant bouts of reciprocal infidelity. To throw another stick into the blaze, both (at times) loved people of their own sex, and yet their marriage not only survived these bouts of unorthodoxy, sexual incompatibility, and long absences, but became stronger and finer as a result. As stated in the Foreword, &quot;each came to give the other full liberty without inquiry or reproach. Honour was rooted in dishonour. Their marriage succeeded because each found permanent and undiluted happiness only in the company of the other. If their marriage is seen as a harbour, their love-affairs were mere ports-of-call. It was to the harbour that each returned; it was there that both were based.&quot; Interesting, to say the least!<br />The story is told in five parts; two by the protagonist Vita Sackville-West, and three by her son, Nigel Nicolson. After his mother's death in 1962, Nigel discovered among her personal items a travel bag containing a large notebook. It was a manuscript, an autobiography written by his mother when she was 28 years old. For a decade Nigel held on to this manuscript, and in 1973 (his father having passed away in 1968) it was published here in Portrait Of A Marriage. Parts 1 and 3 consist of Vita's autobiography verbatim; parts 2 and 4 are Nigel's commentary, each prefaced by a very useful chronological timeline. Part 5 summarizes the remaining years of the marriage, showing how they &quot;made out of a non-marriage a marriage which succeeded beyond their dreams.&quot; The basis of this certainly unconventional marriage was what they called a &quot;common sense of values.&quot; Total frankness. There were certain things that were wrong absolutely, and as long as they agreed on what those things were, it did not matter much if in other ways they behaved outrageously. For them, marriage as an institution was actually &quot;unnatural&quot; and only tolerable for people of strong character and independent minds if it were regarded as a lifetime association between intimate friends. Understood and experienced as such, a successful marriage then became &quot;the greatest of human benefits&quot; and therefore, husband and wife should strive hard to achieve it! &quot;Each must be subtle enough to mould their characters and behaviour to fit the other's, facet to facet, convex to concave. The husband must develop the feminine side of his nature, the wife her masculine side. He must cultivate the qualities of sympathy and intuition; she those of detachment, reason, and decision. He must respond to tears; she must not miss trains.&quot;<br />Of course there will be readers who feel that these two developed these other sides of their &quot;nature&quot; to an extreme perhaps? Detractors however, should be sure to validate their criticism with a marriage of 50 years plus... for here was one that lasted 49, and was inexorably defeated only by physical death itself. Truly bizarre? Yes indeed. These two individuals were so extraordinary and UNIQUE that I think it important to note that their story should not be viewed as a &quot;how-should-we&quot; story... but a &quot;how-did-they&quot; story. In this, it is magnificent as it stands.<br />The author did a tremendous editorial job of putting it all together. Anyone interested in V.

The only reason that I do not consider this book to be even less than two stars is because of the author's note that precedes the first chapter. Here, Beerbohm at least warns us to not look for some sort of satirical meaning to his story; he says that he himself supposed &quot;it was just a fantasy&quot; and that this fantasy was applicable to the &quot;old Oxford&quot; with which he was acquainted. My goodness... the old Oxford must have been well-stocked with buffoons! I am critical of the story itself, rather than the style in which it is written. Beerbohm wrote with great elegance and wit... I only wish this was not his only published novel so we could see him having a go at some better content. The whole idea of an entire class of scholars flinging themselves &quot;like lemmings&quot; into the Isis River over this gal Zuleika is too absurd for me to comprehend, and when I began to realize that this in fact was going to happen in the story I wanted to give up and quit reading. But I finished it and conclude that it is not worth re-reading, and it will suffer a drier fate than its idiot characters did, for it will end up in my dust bin. If Oxford is your alma mater, I can understand you reading this book with the same heartfelt enthusiasm as someone who continues to cheer for their home team while badly losing the game. The rest of us will scratch our heads and wonder how this book ever got to be on The Modern Library's list of the Best 100 Books of The 20th Century.	2001-04-15

How do I relate to a God who is invisible when I'm never quite sure he's there?  Is God playing games? What can we count on this God for? Why do bad things happen, even to good people? Are the many terrible things that happen on earth God's will?<br />Does the great Yancey come up with all the right answers? No! That's what makes his work so continually valuable. He is bold enough to identify and walk along the fault lines in the popular &quot;problem-solution&quot; approach to God, which bases itself on the &quot;if I do this, God will do that&quot; mentality. In wisdom, he looks back and acknowledges that there is a big crack there. In this book, Yancey concludes that God's style is &quot;ironic&quot;... and (for whatever reasons unknown to us) God's direct intervention in the affairs of human beings should be seen as the exception rather than the general rule. Any Christian that denies this is simply being ostrich-headed! (my words there).<br />God may be &quot;ironic&quot; but it is important to note that nowhere is God portrayed as a cosmic killjoy, or an otherwise indifferent bystander as concerns his creation. The following excerpt best describes the focus of the book: &quot;The world is good. The world is fallen. The world can be redeemed. If this sequence describes the story of the universe, then I must learn to look at the world, and myself, through that lens. Faith means developing an ability to accept that point of view, which I will never fully grasp until I reach the summit, no matter how things look along the trail. I learn to trust that God's mysterious style of working on this planet, and of relating to us his creatures, will one day fit into a pattern that makes sense.&quot;<br />This is a book that fleshes out what God has told us all along in Romans 8:28. He is REDEEMING. This is not doom and gloom, nor is it &quot;pie in the sky&quot;, but it IS a reminder of the very definition of &quot;faith&quot;. From this book I learn that there will always be aspects of knowing God that will acquaint me with mystery in the very place where I sought (or demanded?) certitude. Reaching For The Invisible God is subtitled &quot;What can we expect to find?&quot; I think the answer is perhaps that... He is invisible! Incidentally, another question kept going through my mind as I read the book... In what way could it possibly strengthen my FAITH if God were visible? Doesn't &quot;visibility&quot; preclude, or at the very least, displace faith? Doesn't Hebrews 11:1 tell us that &quot;faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things NOT SEEN?&quot;t;.

Starts off great and just keeps getting better and better... far and away, the best of these three gems is A Mixture Of Frailties. How did Davies do it? He took such seemingly innocuous molehills, and fashioned grand mountains out of them. As with the innocently thrown snowball in his Deptford Trilogy, here he uses a false engagement notice (in Leaven of Malice) to grease the gears of a roaring good yarn. Tempest-Tost is the book of this trilogy that can stand the surest on its own; the other two being more sequentially tied to each other in their characterization and story-line. The three together shout a resounding LET'S HEAR IT FOR CANADIAN LITERATURE ! Time well spent in a book... imagine that !<br />I refrain from offering synoptic comments on what I got out of each book, for fear of robbing anyone the pleasure of finding these gifts for themself as they read. I have rarely encountered in fiction a more thoroughly developed character than that of Davies' Monica Gall in AMOF. In her, he brilliantly shows us the inner workings of the creation of the artistic temperament, and the MAKING of an individual. Anthony Burgess commented that Davies displayed &quot;all the qualities of a latter day Trollope.&quot; I would agree, with the addendum that Davies doesn't need the verbosity of a Trollope to achieve equal (or greater) depths. The genius of Davies is that he ends his books before we want him to. Arguably, there will be those who feel this series (written in the 50's) to be somewhat &quot;dated&quot;... i.e., nobody in these stories gets e-mail... or writes online reviews! Davies stuff is the antithesis of pulp fiction. Websters defines literature as &quot;written works having excellence of form or expression and dealing with ideas of permanent interest.&quot; There are lots of great Canadian novels out there... but Davies proves that there is such a thing as a Canadian &quot;literature&quot;.	2001-04-08

Unlike the senseless horror of the &quot;gulag&quot;, The First Circle involves the incarceration of select and highly skilled prisoners in a relatively privileged Soviet prison which is really set up as a research laboratory where these skilled inmates are exploited for their expertise. Here, (after they've been arrested under any number of false pretenses) they are forced to invent and develop elaborate electronic devices which will help in the detection and arrest of any other &quot;subversives&quot;. The main gadget that they are called upon to produce is a &quot;phonoscopy&quot;... a device that will be able to accurately identify a person by examining recorded conversation.<br />Right from the opening tense chapters, Solzhenitsyn once again had me in his grip. For me, he is the master at capturing the foreboding sense of loss of freedom. It is palpable... in some ways, worse than outright murder... because you know that whatever happens to his characters, they are going to have to LIVE through it... they aren't even afforded the luxury of dying. At one point, he used the phrases &quot;trampled yearnings&quot; &amp; &quot;soaring passion&quot; in one sentence and it stuck with me and I feel it summarizes what his characters face here in TFC. In ch.34 the protagonist, Gleb Nerzhin is musing with a fellow inmate on the hardships of imprisonment and he concludes that, of all his deprivations, by far the worst is the loss of freedom to be with his wife. She is allowed a visit once a year, and even then, he is not allowed to kiss her. Hearing this, his cellmate Gerasimovich concludes that &quot;there is probably only one path to invulnerability... to kill within oneself ALL attachments and to renounce ALL desires.&quot;<br />This book looks deeply into the process of passivity that creeps into and consumes the life of the imprisoned. Also, there are times when it reminds us of the resiliency of the human spirit in the midst of numbing regret and longing. (I am thinking of the unforgettable scene of Rubin following the guard toward the end of ch.67).<br />There is a passage in ch.84 which I think wonderfully capsulizes what Solzhenitsyn is telling us here in TFC:  &quot;Unfortunately for people - and fortunately for their rulers - a human being is so constituted that as long as he lives there is always something more that can be taken away from him. Even a person imprisoned for life, deprived of movement, of the sky, of family, of property, can, for instance, be transferred to a damp punishment cell, deprived of hot food, beaten with clubs, and he will feel these petty extra punishments as intensely as his earlier downfall from the heights of freedom and affluence. To avoid these final torments, the prisoner follows obediently the humiliating and hateful prison regime, which slowly kills the human being within him.&quot;<br />This is not a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; book. We may be able to deny ourselves the luxury of exposure to Solzhenitsyn's themes, but one thing we cannot deny is the fact that his books are based upon things that actually happened in history. Because they did. And they do. Here is one of the finest writers of the 20th Century, and this is his masterpiece.Also, there are times when it reminds us of the resiliency of the human spirit in the midst of numbing regret and longing. (I am thinking of the unforgettable scene of Rubin following the guard toward the end of ch.67).<br />There is a passage in ch.84 which I think wonderfully capsulizes what Solzhenitsyn is telling us here in TFC:  &quot;Unfortunately for people - and fortunately for their rulers - a human being is so constituted that as long as he lives there is always something more that can be taken away from him. Even a person imprisoned for life, deprived of movement, of the sky, of family, of property, can, for instance, be transferred to a damp punishment cell, deprived of hot food, beaten with clubs, and he will feel these petty extra punishments as intensely as his earlier downfall from the heights of freedom and affluence. To avoid these final torments, the prisoner follows obediently the humiliating and hateful prison regime, which slowly kills the human being within him.&quot;<br />This is not a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; book. We may be able to deny ourselves the luxury of exposure to Solzhenitsyn's themes, but one thing we cannot deny is the fact that his books are based upon things that actually happened in history. Because they did. And they do. Here is one of the finest writers of the 20th Century, and this is his masterpiece.	2001-04-02

Typical of Lewis's deeper insight into things, his &quot;Experiment&quot; consists in a reversal of the usual method of literary judgement. Instead of classifying BOOKS, he classifies READERS and how they &quot;use&quot; or &quot;receive&quot; books. The true (unbiased) critic does not pontificate a judgement of 'good' or 'bad' upon a book without careful cosideration of the possible confusion between degrees of merit and differences of kind. &quot;I want to convince people,&quot; says Lewis, &quot;that adverse judgements are always the most hazardous... A negative proposition is harder to establish than a positive. One glance may enable us to say there is a spider in the room; we should need a spring-cleaning (at least) before we could say with certainty that there wasn't. When we pronounce a book good we have a positive experience of our own to go upon... In calling the book bad we are claiming not that it can elicit bad reading, but that it can't elicit good. This negative proposition can never be certain.&quot;<br />Central to his argument is the fact that the same book may be read in different ways. It follows then that there is a certain speculative nature to evaluative criticism, and therefore no amount of reliance upon literary criticism can absolve one from the responsibility of becoming a GOOD READER. And what is a good reader? Well, that is the question isn't it? In my opinion (and it is just that... an opinion) I feel that reading Lewis's &quot;Experiment&quot; can answer that question more effectively than anything I've ever come across. Read it, and see where you fit into Lewis's categories of the &quot;literary&quot; and the &quot;unliterary&quot; person (too lengthy to enumerate here). If at any point, you feel offended and want to hurl the book across the room... you are of the latter category.<br />Lewis deplored the technical dissection of what he loved so dearly... the simple act of reading. I loved his image in chapter 2 of the &quot;status seeker&quot; type of readers, gathered to discuss the finer (and, of course HIDDEN) points of &quot;approved literature&quot; while the only real literary experience in such a scenario &quot;may be occurring in a back bedroom where a small boy is reading Treasure Island under the bed-clothes by the light of an electric torch.&quot;<br />Lewis sought in books (as he called it here) an &quot;enlargement of his being&quot;. He says on page 52, &quot;I am probably one of many who, on a wakeful night, entertain themselves with invented landscapes. I trace great rivers from where the gulls scream at the estuary, through the windings of ever narrower and more precipitous gorges, up to the barely audible tinkling of their source in a fold of the moors. But I am not there myself as explorer or even as tourist. I am looking at that world from outside.&quot; This is a terrific/significant book that will be read, re-read, and cherished by anyone who has ever had similar musings.

Here I Stand was a required reading in my college course in Church History, and so my first meeting with it over a decade ago was not entirely of my own free will. But I enjoyed it then, and I enjoyed it even more when I recently dusted it off and read it again. Bainton's book powerfully reminds us that there is no way to appreciate and understand the history of Christian religion if one bypasses the enormous contribution of Martin Luther. If not for Luther's depth of brutal honesty in his own struggle to know God we may all still be living in times when the Word of God was chained to the pulpit. As Luther ineffectually fought his way toward God through &quot;works&quot; he once stated &quot;I was myself more than once driven to the very abyss of despair so that I wished I had never been created. Love God? I hated him!&quot; Bainton recounts how that during 1516-17, Luther's study of the book of Galatians resulted in his revelation of &quot;the just shall live by his faith,&quot; a concept which reconciled for him, once and for all, the issue of the &quot;justice&quot; of God with the &quot;justification&quot; of God. This revelation unleashed the greatest REFORMATION in Christian thinking that could have been imagined at the time. Luther composed his Ninety-Five Theses and was quick to gain his reputation (in the religious world) as &quot;the son of iniquity&quot;. Bainton chases this increasingly interesting story with novel-like tempo, and follows Luther through all of his personal crises, his hidings, false identities, public trials and public triumphs. Friends and foes emerge with all the hilarity and villainy of a great medieval romance... and as the world's greatest non-conformist theologian, Luther barges onto the scene in a very beer-spattering Robin Hood-like way. I found one of the papal bulls referring to the havoc that Luther was wreaking at the time to be particularly hilarious: &quot;Arise O Lord, and judge thy cause. A wild boar has invaded thy vineyard.&quot; A wild boar indeed! It is great fun to watch Martin Luther trample. As I close the book now for the second time, I am no less amazed and breathless at how RADICAL a &quot;stand&quot; Luther took. For me he is a hero to the end. The quintessential INDIVIDUAL.<br />An entertaining, beautifully illustrated, and most of all IMPORTANT book. Of this opinion, I cannot... I will not... recant!ard.&quot; A wild boar indeed!

The book is a collection of sixteen articles written by as many contributors, each focusing on the evangelistic import of the life and work of C.S. Lewis. These are dispersed under four headings, as follows: Pt.I The Motivation: The Influence and Potential of Lewis's Evangelism; Pt.II The Explanation: Why Was Lewis Such an Effective Evangelist?; Pt.III The Technique: Making Christianity Plausible; Pt.IV The Argument: Defending the Faith.<br />As I am not aware of any other book that so specifically approaches this angle of Lewis, I recommend it to all who are interested in learning more about the motivation behind the man. However, (with all due respect to Mr. Menuge, whose own article  outlining certain similarities between the Apostle Paul and Lewis is interesting enough)... I feel that the book as a whole would have benefitted by more careful editing. For instance, there are quotations (some lengthy) which are repeated, and several instances when the reader is left to wonder &quot;Hey, didn't I just read about this in a previous article?&quot; ...Well actually, yes you DID !<br />On the redeeming side, the book opens with Wayne Martindale's excellent and much needed expose of the inaccuracies latent in the 1993 film &quot;Shadowlands&quot; which featured Anthony Hopkins in the role of Lewis. Martindale's research reveals that those most closely involved in the production of this (otherwise commendable) movie were not governed by portrayal of truth or fact. And those who are interested in Lewis's personal understanding of &quot;longing&quot; or &quot;sehnsucht&quot; will appreciate Douglas T. Hyatt's article entitled &quot;Joy, The Call Of God In Man.&quot; Drawing much upon &quot;The Pilgrim's Regress&quot; Hyatt delineates Lewis's &quot;argument from desire&quot; and goes on to show how several other great thinkers like Augustine, Pascal, and even (horrors) Nietzsche, also taught on the concept of the &quot;longing&quot; that cannot be filled by any earthly thing.<br />The occasional less-than-magnificent article notwithstanding, this is still a book that is successful in showing how consistently Christ-centered Lewis was. And considering how weighty and memorable Lewis's pronouncements always were, one wonders whether Menuge's decision at repetition was intentional. If so, I add the fifth star.ng.<br />The occasional less-than-magnificent article notwithstanding, this is still a book that is successful in showing how consistently Christ-centered Lewis was.

The main character, Kenzie is in need of both... and he, in turn, needs to demonstrate both of these towards his brother Dalton. But even above this, I think that The Storm has much to say about the power of &quot;belonging&quot; and the lessons learned while rebuilding one's life after an experience of profound loss and disgrace. Kenzie comes closest to a realization of BELONGING through his relationship with Willow, but according to Kenzie, the world is not famous for happy endings... his is a sort of morose character who is quietly seeking his sense of &quot;home&quot;. Does he ever really find it?<br />Sometimes it may take a real storm (some sort of mutually experienced calamity) to make us aware of the importance of living in community, the need to live &quot;grace&quot;fully, the need for brotherly love to be freely given as much as it is possible. It is remarkable how Buechner's book has left me with a sense of the importance of &quot;family&quot;. This is a worthwhile read!	2001-03-14

Who else would have been able to fit the Dark Ship with (of course) &quot;darkbulbs&quot; rather than &quot;lightbulbs&quot;? Bravo S.R.!<br />A recurring motif is &quot;What's the use of stories that aren't even true?&quot; Haroun couldn't get that terrible question out of his head. It was posed to him repeatedly, and it's really his conviction that stories ARE useful that motivates most of the action in this book. It is my opinion that Rushdie has written here a convincing and timeless story about the very importance of &quot;story&quot;. Well worth the reading. A hilarious fanciful gem.

I just finished this book... in fact, Zenia's ashes are probably still hovering over the water... Roz and Tony are right now slipping some of Charis's well-intentioned hors d'oeuvres into their pockets under the table to throw out on their way home...<br />I am a guy, and I actually enjoyed reading about these gals. I'm sure the book probably has a 99% female readership... which is O.K. and understandable, but it's too bad more guys don't read Atwood stuff... it's very educational and entertaining. There's more grit, hilarity, and bouncing off the ropes here than in any afternoon of the WWF !!<br />For a while I was disappointed in the co-incidence that all of the female characters seem to come from overly similar dysfunctional (even suicidal) parental lineage... they have similar inner struggles and propensities toward dual personalities. Redundant? But then I considered that it is often this very type of thing that can cause people to gravitate towards one another... even without the awareness of each other's history. So it is not unduly &quot;contrived&quot; that the three main characters should come together over the decades that are represented here. At any rate, it is Zenia, (who leaves nothing of &quot;co-incidence&quot; in her wake) that is the common denominator... the robber &quot;mistress&quot; as it were, that causes the three to increasingly interact and support one another.<br />Word to the men here though... if you need to feel like a hero, stick with Tom Clancy or whatever. The only real criticism I have of The Robber Bride is that (with all due respect to the capricious properties of testosterone), I'm not sure that all men are as ready to abandon established relationships and chase after silicone as are the men that are portrayed here. But, all that aside, I really enjoyed the book and was interested throughout.	2001-03-05

I still have that fear, but the time has come to at least say that this is my favorite novel of all time. I refer to the Magarshack translation which I have read and now re-read. I can't imagine a more intriguing story... admittedly however, it would help if the reader had an interest in the world that Tolstoy inhabited. There are so many (often lengthy) asides into his thoughts on abstention from worldly riches / social reconstruction etc. Tolstoy gets his character Levin to do reams of his own preaching on these subjects but again, because I find Tolstoy himself to be one of the most interesting characters Russia has ever produced, I don't mind finding him so obviously entrenched in his own story here.<br />But &quot;Anna&quot; is first and foremost a LOVE story which depicts the fleeting and disastrous effects of tempestous/undisciplined love (Anna and Vronsky) over against the lasting and mutually beneficial results of patient/disciplined love (Levin and Kitty). This book is an important masterpiece without rival in literature. Reading such a book on one's death-bed would not be a waste of time.<br />When I think of Anna, I am reminded of something that Solzhenitsyn made one of his fictional characters say in his book The First Circle: &quot;In the 17th century there was Rembrandt, and there is Rembrandt today. Just try to improve on him. And yet the technology of the 17th century now seems primitive to us. Or take the technological innovations of the 1870's. For us they're child's play. But that was when Anna Karenina was written. What can you name that's superior?&quot;<br />Read Anna... and you will be as silent as I am on that one!	2001-03-01

I am truly astounded at some of the less than 5-star reviews... have these reviewers read any OTHER biographies of Lewis?

It's one thing to know via secondary research that &quot;with his meal Jack liked to drink a couple of glasses of red wine&quot;... but Sayers clinked glasses with him! With Sayers, Lewis spoke frankly about his personal temptations, spiritual difficulties, creative processes, sundry preferences and worries.<br />This biography can be read with novel-like enthusiasm by even peripheral Lewisites... and those of us already up to our necks will not mind holding our breath as this book rolls over us. Rather than use this forum to berate another popular Lewis biography whose author has the initials A.N.W., I'll just say that this one is a clear note that rings true.	2001-02-14

An American doctor once asked Viktor Frankl to explain the difference between conventional psychoanalysis and logotherapy. Before answering, Frankl asked the doctor for his definition of psychoanalysis. The man said, &quot;During psychoanalysis, the patient must lie down on a couch and tell you things which sometimes are very disagreeable to tell.&quot; Frankl immediately replied by saying: &quot;Now, in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear.&quot; By this he meant that in logotherapy the patient is actually confronted with and reoriented toward the MEANING of his life. The role of the therapist, then, is to help the patient discover a purposefulness in his life. Frankl's theory is that man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a &quot;secondary rationalization&quot; of instinctual drives. Whereas Freudian psychoanalysis focuses on the &quot;will to pleasure&quot; and Adlerian psychology focuses on the &quot;will to power&quot; it can be said that Frankl's logotherapy focuses on the &quot;will to meaning.&quot; Does man give in to to conditions or stand up to them? According to Frankl, the strength of a person's sense of meaning, responsibility, and purpose is the greatest determining factor in how that question will be answered. He believed that &quot;man is ultimately self-determining&quot; and as such, &quot;does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.&quot;<br />The first (and largest) section of this book is the searing autobiographical account of the author's experience as a longtime prisoner in a concentration camp. These camps claimed the lives of his father, mother, brother, and wife. Frankl's survival and the subsequent miracle of this book are a testimony to man's capacity to rise above his outward fate. As Gordon W. Allport states in the preface, &quot;A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to.&quot;<br />I agree, and highly reccommend this book. As the sub-title says, it is an &quot;introduction&quot; to logotherapy, and anyone who wants to go deeper into the principles and practical application of Frankl's existential psychiatry should go to his excellent &quot;The Doctor And The Soul&quot;.<br />Frankl was fond of quoting Nietzsche's dictum...&quot;He who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW.&quot;as faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to.&quot;<br />I agree, and highly reccommend this book.

No theologian of our century has so seriously questioned the premises of our Christian beliefs as Bonhoeffer has. And no one has dared to thrust the Church into the &quot;world&quot; and so honestly explored the implications of doing so, as him. And certainly no one has brought to the world a vision of Christ large enough, embracive enough, to make full-hearted involvement in the secular efforts of our time a Christian imperative. At the mere age of 39, such a light as this was extinguished, and who has there been to take his place?<br />When we are reading L&amp;PFP, we are reading fragments of incomparable genius... fragments that at one point or another were packed in tin cans and buried in the garden of Dietrich's best friend/nephew-in-law (Eberhard Bethge). Because of Bethge's own arrest in October of 1944, many letters were lost... these that survive reveal to us enough of Bonhoeffer's wrestlings with &quot;religionless Christianity&quot; and the &quot;non-religious interpretation of biblical concepts&quot; to conclude that his ideas came from no one who preceded him... he was without a doubt the most original of theological thinkers.<br />The friendship that Dietrich shared with E. Bethge was indeed profound, and as such, he speaks with him in these letters with greater intellectual depth and honesty than is evident in most of his other correspondence. At one point he even expressed the opinion that the success of any of his thought and writing depended on whether or not he would again be given the opportuinity to freely interact with Bethge. That time never came for Dietrich. On April 9, 1945 he was executed at the concentration camp at Flossenburg.<br />Especially poignant is the abrupt end of the contact between Dietrich and Eberhard, and the frustrated attempts of his parents and fiance to locate him. Unbeknownst to all of those closest to him, Dietrich had been transferred to Buchenwald, and  one can only inadequately imagine the pain of such loss of  contact. Bonhoeffer is a hero of the Christian faith, and I feel that in many ways, the reading of this book ought to be some sort of non-optional Christian event.<br />On February 23, 1944 he wrote: &quot;The important thing today is that we should be able to discern from the fragment of our life how the whole was arranged and planned, and what material it consists of. For really, there are some fragments that are only worth throwing into the dustbin (even a decent 'hell' is too good for them), and others whose importance lasts for centuries, because their completion can only be a matter for God, and so they are fragments that must be fragments...

Well, I am not a mathematician, nor even mathematically inclined, so mine won't be the review of a fanatic, nor even one based on comparison with other books that deal with the subject.

He made the topic very interesting, and now I know what an algorithm is! I will also be able to think critically about the next statistic I am persuaded to swallow.<br />The book presents a very convincing case for the author's  conclusion that &quot;probability, like logic, is not just for mathematicians anymore. It permeates our lives.&quot; I found it fascinating how Paulos explained the complexities involved in the flipping of coins, or the rolling of dice... how that even asking the proverbial &quot;Myrtle&quot; out on a date is a foray into the world of probability. Even my rating of this book as being 4 out of a possible 5 stars is an example of how much we knowingly or unknowingly rely on numerical criteria in our daily lives.

If I was allowed only one sentence to summarize this book, I would frame it thus: Here is a fictional account of what happens when the devil comes to visit a city that does not believe in him! I just finished reading M &amp; M an hour ago, and I must say, there is much philosophical depth strewn throughout its constant morphings and manifestations. It should be read for what it is, a comic masterpiece that defies any genre placement... it is like no other book I've ever encountered, and can only somewhat be likened to the supernatural thrillers of Charles Williams.<br />In M &amp; M, Bulgakov has us marvellously believing in a huge vodka-drinking talking cat; a woman (Margarita) who becomes an invisible, broom-riding aeronaut; a man who turns into a supersonic flying hog... an animated suit with no-one in it... there is no end to the Bulgamorphic inventiveness. It is no wonder that half of his Moscow ends up in an insane asylum at one point or another. I could never give a better synopsis of the book than the official amazon editorial review by Mary Park, (as seen above) so I will refrain from an attempt... but I will say that at no less than 25 different passages I did some cross-referencing with a different translation (the Pevear/Volkhonsky) and always felt that the Burgin/Tiernan-O'Connor was superior in readability.<br />It is such a unique book that there are many plausible/valid interpretations of who the main character really is. In my opinion, it is Ivan Bezdomny, the disillusioned poet who seems to have internalized the best conception of who Woland (the devil) really was. Bezdomny is a sort of &quot;parenthesis&quot; to the story, he's there on the first page and he's there on the last, and though he is not on stage (so to say) as much as the others... when the curtain falls, it seems that he is the one who best understands what has happened to Moscow. The only one who seems to know more is the full moon overhead...<br />Read the book. It's truly ominous.	2001-02-02

Pierre Brossard is a man on the run for his life.  For over 40 years he has been in hiding, counting on the complicity of the Catholic Church to perpetuate his anonymity. During WWII, Brossard was a member of the &quot;milice&quot;  and as part of his duties at the time he personally shot 14 Jews in a clandestine pogrom and subsequently co-operated in the sending of many Jews from France to extermination camps. Through his many connections, Brossard managed at one point to obtain an official political pardon for his war-crimes, but now (in 1989) the charge of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; has been added... with the result that even some of his strongest supporters have turned against him. There is a renewed interest in his case; he's running out of places to hide... and he has more pursuers than ever before.<br />Moore has written a great meditation on the historical processes and conditions that make war crimes or crimes against humanity so difficult to pursue. Brossard is demonstrative of the expertise with which such &quot;criminals&quot; are able to exploit various forces of compromise, immunity, asylum and refuge. Many questions are subtly raised by this book. The Church here affords a sort of refuge to the retributive justice that the outside world demands (concerning Brossard's obvious past crimes/sins)... but what of Brossard's inner torment? Even if the Church offers (grants) Divine pardon... does the pardon of man/society necessarily follow? Should it? (I hope not). What do we make of priestly absolution when it proves ineffective as conscience-cleanser? Is this question being answered when, with his final breath, Brossard tries to be penitent and sense God's pardon, and all he is afforded is a final look (in his mind's eye) at the people that he has killed?<br />It is a story told by a genius writer, Moore didn't even know how to disappoint a reader.

I agree 100% with the Thorburn review directly below mine... it's a great and accurate review. I agree especially with the comment that one should start with Buechner's excellent memoir-trilogy (listed there) before venturing into this one. And if you're still interested in Buechner, by all means, The Longing For Home will be meaningful for you at many points. Don't get me wrong, I am convinced that anything Buechner writes is definitely worth reading, it's just that this book seemed a  trifle esoteric, even for a Buechnerite like myself.<br />I usually try to avoid subjective comments like the one I'm about to make, but I found the poetry section a bit too &quot;on the inside&quot; (obscure?) for me, as with the chapter entitled &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot;... I can only imagine these slices of the book as being of interest to an extremely select minority of readers. They are not &quot;generally&quot; appealing. But then, the chapter &quot;Of Whipples and Wheels&quot; had me actually consulting a map of Vermont, trying to locate the places Buechner is discussing. It was very interesting stuff (incidentally, I never did find the locations). And there are A+ insightful theological homilies in the latter chapters.<br />I have enjoyed all of F.B.'s writing over the years, however, this particular volume is definitely one for only the initiated and highly interested.	2001-01-29

He feels that its popularity is due largely to &quot;the personal recommendation of one reader to another.&quot; (source: the author's preface to the Jan.'99 Plume edition). Interesting, since this is exactly how I myself was introduced to the book. While at a friend's I noticed it on his shelf, and as I thumbed through it I was literally shocked at the animation with which a few Pillar-cultists in the room began DEMANDING that I read it. It was a non-optional situation. I took. I read. It's become one of my fave novels of all time, and it's definitely true... there's just something about it that makes you want to tell everyone else to read it. Once, while queued up in the aisle of a de-boarding 737 the guy behind me saw my book and said &quot;Great story isn't it?&quot; Seriously, if you read it, you will tell others to read it... Follett is 100% accurate on that!<br />So what makes it so great? Well for one thing, here we have immense subject matter (the building of a huge cathedral), and for a period of over fifty fictional years Follett pulls this thread through all of the lives of those who will serve either in the strengthening or smashing of this cathedral-dream. What results is all of a piece. The story is so captivating that at times I had to stop reading and tell myself to settle down. So believable at every turn. Secondly, it is remarkable in the way it stays in the memory. Usually a book of this length tends to sort of blur soon after the initial reading. But now, almost a year after I've read it, intricacies of the story are still seared in the memory. I can still turn to any page at random and immediately the particular scene is re-kindled in my imagination, the setting as clear as when I originally read it.<br />Finally, the book is as great as its characters. It would be difficult to find anywhere in recent literature a character as calculating and devious as Waleran Bigod; as devoted and consistent as Philip; as unassuming as Tom Builder; as noble and captivating as Aliena; as gifted and winsome as Jack; as resourceful and spontaneous as Ellen... and the villainous evil that lurks and erupts in William Hamleigh makes Shakespeare's Iago look like Winnie The Pooh!<br />Follett says in his 1999 preface: &quot;Many people asked me to write a sequel.

Any lover of books and reading will love the time spent here in these pages. &quot;Time&quot; is often the reason many people give for NOT reading. Others often feel guilty about the actual amount of time that they gladly devote to reading. I admit that I am of this latter group. Reading Manguel's book puts it all in perspective... makes me fall in love with the printed word all over again, and helps me to realize that I am part of a long line of splendour... that there is indeed, a wonderful history of those who have loved reading and/or writing books.<br />His book is an excellent thematic study; the erudite gleanings of seven years of research, and chockfull of the personal touch of a lifetime of being profoundly bookish. Along with vignettes of his personal acquaintance with Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges, there are very insightful passages on Franz Kafka, Walt Whitman, Rainer Maria Rilke and many other greats. I remember being surprised that Manguel (a Canadian resident since 1982) was not even shortlisted for the Governor General's award for this book... but then later on it won one of the world's most prestigious of awards, France's Prix Medicis... and all was well with the world.<br />It's a beautifully written book.

Have you ever read poetry that left you wondering what in the world the poor guy/gal was trying to say? Ever wondered if the poet was deliberately trying to leave you to choke in the dust of their own confusion? (hey, that's pretty poetic)! Ever felt that you'd like to revoke some poetic licenses? My guess is that if any of these feelings apply to you... you weren't reading Hardy at the time. Hardy may be a bit pessimistic, (Philip Larkin correctly remarked that &quot;the dominant emotion in Hardy is sadness&quot;) and for him the glass may be forever half empty... but he's always clearheaded, and he makes sense. No confusion or rambling. The hundreds of poems in this huge volume span a lifetime, and are written by a man who considered himself a poet by choice; a novelist by necessity. Poetry was his heart's passion. This is why someone as great as Ezra Pound could claim that &quot;no-one has taught me anything about writing since Thomas Hardy died.&quot;<br />For pathos, depth of content, and variety of style and rhyme, I think you have to go to Shakespeare or Browning to find anyone to compare with Hardy's verse. Who has written anything to rival &quot;The Darkling Thrush&quot; in the 100 years since?

Through a study of the diverse lives of the characters here assembled, Solzhenitsyn probes with searing exactitude the process of living with cancer, and more specifically, the TREATMENT of cancer in Stalinist Russia. He had reason to be acquainted with firsthand knowledge of the topic. In 1954, the 35 year old Solzhenitsyn was himself diagnosed with a rare form of cancer known as seminoma, and was admitted for radiation treatment.<br />The importance of Cancer Ward lies in its ability for us as readers to consider that aspect of life which we all have in common... our mortality. Here we see all the possibilities of response: initial denial, hope, fear, loss of freedom, reluctance to accept treatment, despair, eventual resignation... we laugh and we cry with those who laugh and cry. These are REAL fictional people. In fact, the character of Oleg Kostoglotov is very similar to that of Solzhenitsyn himself. Kostoglotov is the optimistic realist, and one of the few who ever leave the cancer ward on their own two legs. The biographer D.M. Thomas has noted that Solzhenitsyn seemed to have defeated his cancer by his own &quot;iron determination to live&quot;, as does Kostoglotov. Often in the novel, K is pitted against Rusinov, a high-ranking government official who has the most prolonged struggle with accepting his own diagnosis. One significant verbal exchange between the two is as follows:<br />Rusinov: &quot;We musn't talk about death! We mustn't even remind anyone of it.&quot; Kostoglotov: &quot;If we can't talk about death HERE, where on earth can we?&quot;<br />On September 22, 1967 a session of the Union of Soviet Writers was convened to discuss the degree of censorship to which Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward should be subjected... some came to revile and berate him, others were there to offer a sort of restrained praise. At that meeting, the author stated: &quot;...I absolutely do not understand why Cancer Ward is being accused of being antihumanitarian. Quite the reverse is true: life conquers death, the past is conquered by the future... In general, the task of the writer cannot be reduced to defence or criticism of one or another form of government. The tasks of the writer are connected with more general and durable questions, such as the secrets of the human heart and conscience...&quot; After Solzhenitsyn had left to catch his train, it is reported that one of the committee members (Surkov) said: &quot;Well, now we can relax over a few vodkas. I'll tell you what I really think. It may be that when the Soviet empire has gone the way of the Third Reich, Cancer Ward will come to stand even higher than First Circle among his novels. The latter is perhaps just a bit too enclosed, so to speak, within our political system, whereas the former, by dealing with something universal in human experience - cancer, pain, the certainty of dying - will never lose any of its relevance.&quot;<br />I could not agree more wholeheartedly.others were there to offer a sort of restrained praise.

Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.<br />Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35  &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot;  The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.<br />And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).<br />Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.<br />&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case.

Lewis and addressed to Sheldon as he tried to make sense of his overwhelming grief.<br />This is the story of a profound love between two people... a love that has its genesis, consummation, and terminus in heavenly places.

Buechner has shaped this story with an economy of words, and it often reads like a superb narrative poem. I read it in one sitting and was captivated by its grace.<br />A recurring theme in the book is the disparity between what is commonly perceived as &quot;sainthood&quot; or &quot;saintliness&quot; and what the saint, in fact, knows himself to be. Like Paul in the New Testament (see Romans chapter 7 for instance), Godric is continually brought to an awareness of his inner wretchedness as compared with other's perception of him. At one point his scribe Reginald reminds him that the name Godric means &quot;God reigns&quot; but Godric himself feels more affinity with the term &quot;God's wreck.&quot; He says, &quot;...Godric's sins have made a wreck of God.&quot;<br />Elsewhere he concludes that &quot;life's a list. Good tilts with ill.&quot; Sounds negative? Well, if the sky is blue on your planet, pull up a chair and introduce yourself to LIFE! With those words, Godric is referring to the reality that in many instances evil men prosper while the good suffer privation. Even in the church, the Lord is oftentimes mocked by those who ought to have exalted Him the most. And sincere folks are often given to attributing holiness to those most undeserving. In this book we learn that holiness must, of necessity, be something other than good behavior... it turns out to be nothing other than the unmerited presence of God.<br />A beautiful book. Well worth reading, and as some have suggested, re-reading many times. I plan to. We see ourselves here.	2001-01-03

In 1925, Martha Ostenso was a young student enrolled in a writing course at New York's Columbia University. Upon hearing that the publishers Dodd, Mead, and Company were holding a contest for the best North American novel she decided to return to Winnipeg Manitoba and devote herself to winning the prize. From her rented room, she completed the draft of Wild Geese in a mere six weeks. Her submission beat out 1,389 competitors to win, and became her first of many published novels.<br />Wild Geese is the story of the Gares, a very secluded rural family that is presided over by the tyrrannical father/husband Caleb Gare. He subjects them to what can only be described as daily slavery... fiercely suppressing anything that does not contribute to his maniacal tilling of the land. Because of Caleb's selfish need for constant control and domination of others, freedom of expression is not allowed in the Gare household. But this does not set well at all for his fiery tigress of a daughter (Judith) and their live-in schoolteacher Lind Archer. Together, these two women represent the hope of passion, the power of beauty, and the occasional whiff of perfume amidst the manure of Caleb's machinations. Will he be able to ultimately thwart his daughter's freedom? Will Caleb be able to destroy Lind's lover with the terrible secret that only he and his wife know about? Not until the VERY last pages do we really know the answers to those questions, and Ostenso does a great job of keeping the reader interested up to that point and beyond.<br />She is very much in the style of Willa Cather who also wrote of the windswept plains of the early 1900's. If you enjoy Cather's well-known &quot;O Pioneers&quot; or &quot;My Antonia&quot; I think you will really enjoy Wild Geese.	2000-12-23

Davies once commented that he knew &quot;nothing about medicine&quot; but had the highest degree of &quot;hypochondriachal curiosity about it that is characteristic of authors.&quot; (source: his 1984 lecture entitled Can A Doctor Be A Humanist?). Here in his final novel, Davies seems to have given vent to his curiosity in the creation of the character Jonathan Hullah... an unconventional physician who gains a reputation through his intuitive (albeit successful) diagnostic techniques. For the eccentric Hullah, observation of, conversation with, and even &quot;sniffing&quot; of the patient brings him closer to an accurate prognosis than ever would an impersonal reading of a medical chart. Central to this holistic approach to medicine is Hullah's appreciation of not only the physical/biological aspects of man's nature, but also the mental and spiritual, and because of this understanding, he becomes known as the Cunning Man. It is a term borrowed from Robert Burton's &quot;The Anatomy Of Melancholy&quot; in a passage that appears on Davies' title page: &quot;Cunning men, wizards, and white witches, as they call them, in every village, which, if they be sought unto, will help almost all infirmities of body and mind... The body's mischiefs, as Plato proves, proceed from the soul: and if the mind be not first satisfied, the body can never be cured.&quot;<br />Through all of the great doctor's associations (as all the while, it applies also to himself) we find this theme played out... that to be truly healthy one must pay attention to MORE than merely the physical machine.<br />I enjoyed this story, but I agree with several other reviewers that this is not Davies' finest book. It does not have quite the plot-strength of any of his other ten novels, but true Davies devotees will not dismantle their bearded statues over this. To the not-already worshipful, I encourage you that reading ANY Davies is better than to have not read him at all.	2000-12-19

As in all of his autobiographical work, Buechner is remarkably transparent and honest. Whether or not you have enjoyed his fiction, (and I have) I believe there is something here for us all to relate to and identify with.  Two passages in the book are very TELLING as they apply to the SECRETS that we all have: Firstly, &quot;We cannot undo our old mistakes or their consequences any more than we can erase old wounds that we have both suffered and inflicted, but through the power that memory gives us of thinking, feeling, imagining our way back through time we can at long last finally finish with the past in the sense of removing its power to hurt us and other people and to stunt our growth as human beings.&quot; Secondly, &quot;It is through memory that we are able to reclaim much of our lives that we have long since written off by finding that in everything that has happened to us over the years God was offering us possibilities of new life and healing which, though we may have missed them at the time, we can still choose and be brought to life by and healed by all these years later.&quot;<br />Reading the first two books in the memoir series (The Sacred Journey and Now And Then) are not prerequisites to enjoying this one, for its message is self-contained. But if you start here, you'll want to look into the others.	2000-12-10

Of us.&quot;	A group of young schoolchildren (all male) are evacuated from Britain in the wake of a nuclear war. As it turns out, their airplane has crashed onto an uninhabited island, with the result that there are no adult survivors to be found. In the opening scenes, children begin to slowly emerge from the forest and converge on the beach at the summons of the book's main character Ralph. As they are now thrust together in this new environment, it becomes apparent that a new sort of social order is going to be necessary. What follows for the length of the book is an elaborate working out of this (attempted) democratic style of social order.<br />After an initial confrontation of two groups on the beach (one led by Ralph, the other led by Jack), Ralph is elected as leader. Early on, we see that Ralph's interests tend to be &quot;group&quot; oriented. His concern is with rescue, and with keeping the others focused on this objective through the maintenance of a signal fire. We see shadows in Jack however, that are more temporal, concerned with the hungry rumble in his stomach. And here we sense the beginnings of conflict, and the age-old fact looming to remind us that, even in democracy we need to recognize submission to elected leadership.<br />In a pivotal chapter (ch.5) one of the children declares &quot;We're drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grown-up.&quot; The significance here is that, by filling his island with castaway children (rather than adults) Golding allows us to consider more aspects of innate or instinctual human nature than if it had been otherwise. Children are raw. If this island were inhabited by castaway &quot;grown-ups&quot; the results and conclusions they came to would be conditioned by all of the ingenuity, resourcefulness, and maturity with which they'd have dealt with previous struggles and needs. Socially, they would have been able to draw upon the results (good or bad) of past decisions made in the clash and clang of more mature inclinations and inhibitions. But children are not afforded this perspective of experience. Golding populates his island with children because he wants to emphasize the full range of possibilities that are INNATE in the human condition, typified in this case by Ralph's tears on the very last page. Tears, we are told, which he wept &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.&quot;<br />With the frenzied killing of Simon in ch.9 comes the real disintegration; a rapid descent into moral anarchy. Ralph is the only one who dares to say it... &quot;That was murder.&quot; He has the keenest sense of the mob mentality that will inevitably run roughshod over the individual conscience. Earlier than any of the others he understands their own capacity for evil when he says to Piggy, &quot;I'm frightened. Of us.&quot;<br />I had the heartrate of a chased fox in the last chapter... you will too. And when the question was flung out at the end &quot;Who's boss here?&quot;... Ralph's loud cry of &quot;I am&quot; rang through my very soul. Those two words signify the triumph of perception over ignorance.<br />The lasting value of the book is its ability to pose the question &quot;What if I were thrust into a similar situation?&quot; Which character would I most resemble... with whom do I most identify? How is it then, that we in fact, do behave?

But children are not afforded this perspective of experience. Golding populates his island with children because he wants to emphasize the full range of possibilities that are INNATE in the human condition, typified in this case by Ralph's tears on the very last page. Tears, we are told, which he wept &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.&quot;<br />With the frenzied killing of Simon in ch.9 comes the real disintegration; a rapid descent into moral anarchy. Ralph is the only one who dares to say it... &quot;That was murder.&quot; He has the keenest sense of the mob mentality that will inevitably run roughshod over the individual conscience. Earlier than any of the others he understands their own capacity for evil when he says to Piggy, &quot;I'm frightened. Of us.&quot;<br />I had the heartrate of a chased fox in the last chapter... you will too. And when the question was flung out at the end &quot;Who's boss here?&quot;... Ralph's loud cry of &quot;I am&quot; rang through my very soul. Those two words signify the triumph of perception over ignorance.<br />The lasting value of the book is its ability to pose the question &quot;What if I were thrust into a similar situation?&quot; Which character would I most resemble... with whom do I most identify? How is it then, that we in fact, do behave?

This book is not an analytical commentary, nor does it spend itself on technical matters of literary or form criticism. It is not written for the sake of theological precision, or hair-splitting on controversial issues. Rather, Yancey has chosen here in TBJR to focus on certain aspects of the Old Testament books of Job, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and the Prophets because these seem to speak most profoundly to his own spiritual pilgrimage. He explains in the preface that he wants to write about them &quot;personally and subjectively&quot; because they address his own &quot;doubts and struggles, not because I expect these books to teach me the secrets of life.&quot; As in his other great writings (especially Disappointment With God), he lets us know early on that the insights he will be sharing are not only the fruit of profound scholarship, but are practical, applicable truths that have been ground out in the crucible of experience.<br />I have often wished I'd stumble across a charged-up flashlight as I groped through some darker passages of the Old Testament... in TBJR I felt as though I were handed that flashlight quite a few times. For brevity's sake I will mention only one of many instances; simple, yet significant. In the chapter on Psalms, Yancey points out that &quot;the psalms do not theologize.&quot; They are rather to be likened to a sampling of spiritual journals written by several people, expressing diverse and even contradictory emotions and opinions. Though I've studied theology for years, I'd never reflected (adequately) on the simple fact that the intended audience for the psalms was not other people, but God! Therefore, they must be read in an entirely different way than one would read the Epistles or other didactic books.<br />In my opinion, Yancey is the most INTERESTING and accessable Christian writer of our time, and I even find myself often judging other writers by how &quot;Yanceyesque&quot; they are. Even so, the best way to truly appreciate the depth of Yancey's work, is (ironically) to set his stuff aside from time to time, and read the ACTUAL Bible that Jesus read, which is after all, the source of his own inspiration.reciate the depth of Yancey's work, is (ironically) to set his stuff aside from time to time, and read the ACTUAL Bible that Jesus read, which is after all, the source of his own inspiration.	2000-11-30

Here is a book which I can unreservedly recommend to anyone who is currently thinking about how they should think. Of course, Blamires (pronounced &quot;the choirs&quot;) is addressing himself mainly to the Christian reader, but ALL readers can benefit from this exclusively Christian author who is honest enough to begin his book with the words... &quot;There is no longer a Christian mind.&quot; If you have ever wondered why Christian &quot;thought&quot; seems increasingly irrelevant, read this book and find out many of the reasons why your hunch is PERHAPS justified. I started to fold back the top corner of pages that I found especially illuminating, until I realized that I might as well just fold up the entire book. (see title of this review).<br />The author's call for the recovery of the authentic Christian mind is not a call for the abolition of, nor even the belittling of, the secular mind. It is a call for the critical understanding of the difference between the two. This difference forms the fundamental premise of the book, which is thus: &quot;To think secularly is to think within a frame of reference bounded by the limits of our life here on earth: it is to keep one's calculations rooted in this-worldly criteria. To think christianly is to accept all things with the mind as related, directly or indirectly, to man's eternal destiny as the redeemed and chosen child of God.&quot;<br />I especially appreciated the fact that Blamires posits a form of critical thinking that is predominantly POSITIVE. He legitamizes the need for examination of world views (in literature for instance) which the Christian may disagree with or even abhor, but laments the lack of current Christian dialogue regarding these views. There are issues in the human situation which may touch us pre-eminently &quot;as a Christian&quot; but the tragedy is that too often the only way we can pursue these currents of thought is by &quot;more reading of non-Christian literature written by skeptics, and by discussion of it within the intellectual frame of reference which these skeptics have manufactured.&quot; This is sad and regettable, because the eternal perspective of the Christian mind is meant to challenge secular thinking, not be undermined by it. But how will it challenge, if it refuses to think? Be assured that the secular mindset will not hesitate to fill such a void. Indeed, from the first sentence onward, Blamires shows that we are living in a time when such temporal thinking prevails. Even so, the book has much POSITIVE to say to those who choose (at some point) to understand the nature of Christian truth as being objective, authoritative, unshakable, and God-given.and by discussion of it within the intellectual frame of reference which these skeptics have manufactured.&quot; This is sad and regettable, because the eternal perspective of the Christian mind is meant to challenge secular thinking, not be undermined by it.

She falls to the ground... and that's apparently enough to launch Robertson Davies into one of the most intricately woven stories you will ever read! In a 1992 lecture, Davies said that the last book in this trilogy could be summed up by saying... &quot;you never can tell.&quot;<br />The Deptford Trilogy braids the diverse lives of three main characters who achieve their respective fame in wholly different ways. One, as a schoolteacher/hagiologist; one as an entrepeneur/financier; and the other as a master magician/illusionist. Each book focuses in its order on the above mentioned characters respectively. But the theme of &quot;you never can tell&quot; is consistent throughout. It is brilliant how Davies disperses these characters and then brings them back together, and while these reunions sometimes totter on the very edge of the overly contrived (or improbable), they always seem to fall back on the near side of believability. He literally stuffs the envelope of circumstance without lapsing into the absurd. We are left with the sense that the events of these stories could have happened to anyone... yet these events are, in themselves, so magnificent! Does this mean that each of our own simple lives have similar potential for greatness?<br />I believe Davies would answer with a resounding &quot;Definitely!&quot; He once said, &quot;You never can tell where something quite extraordinary and unexpected will come about. In a little Ontario village three men may be born so closely together that their lives run parallel courses, who may influence the world in quite different ways.&quot; He shows us in the Deptford Trilogy how (seemingly) insignificant beginnings can lead to tremendous endings. In fact, nothing that happens in life is insignificant.<br />I can't imagine anyone wading into Fifth Business and wanting out before they finished World Of Wonders.<br />December 2nd, 1995 saw the passing of Robertson Davies; the loss of a man of letters whom John Irving considered to be &quot;the greatest comic novelist in the English language since Charles Dickens.&quot; Read the Deptford Trilogy, and you will wish, as I do, that there were an answer to the question... &quot;What has Mr. Davies written lately?&quot;ed World Of Wonders.<br />December 2nd, 1995 saw the passing of Robertson Davies; the loss of a man of letters whom John Irving considered to be &quot;the greatest comic novelist in the English language since Charles Dickens.&quot; Read the Deptford Trilogy, and you will wish, as I do, that there were an answer to the question... &quot;What has Mr. Davies written lately?&quot;	2000-11-23

I would describe it as a light and lyrical fable with refreshing moral undertones. Because the narrator of the story is the archangel Raphael, the reader is afforded inside information from someone in direct contact with the Holy One. We get to identify with the characters in the story as they struggle with discerning the will of God in certain areas... and we get to hear Raphael's often humorous impression of these struggles. No-one in the story is aware of Raphael's real identity because he has assumed the personage of a normal man named Azarias and commits to accompany the main character Tobias in quest of a family fortune. Hence, the book's title.<br />Along the way, Raphael lets us in on the following paradox. He tells us that too often the world not only BELIEVES in God for all the wrong reasons, but it also DISBELIEVES in God for all the wrong reasons. There is a subtle, yet clear message in this story that the Holy One is not the cosmic &quot;Scorekeeper&quot; that the characters continually make him out to be. Although all earthly indications may appear as such, the Holy One never looks upon his creation with indifference.<br />But this is not a textbook, it's just a really good &quot;out-there-on-the-beach-blanket&quot; whimsical story with a dash of sound theology sprinkled throughout... by an angel.	2000-11-20

Charles Dickens once said, &quot;In the little world in which children have their existence, whoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice. It may be only a small injustice the child can be exposed to; but the child is small; and its world is small.&quot; Angela's Ashes amounts to a brilliant recollection of childhood injustice which is indeed... LARGE! As I read the book, I was appalled at the depth of poverty that Frank McCourt and his family endured, and yet, I can't count the number of times I actually laughed out loud at the &quot;way&quot; in which the story is told. I've never read anything so simultaneously light and weighty. McCourt is witty, and is always in character, and that character is the child who was an eye-witness to every event. (An intriguing, fiercely narrative writing style is consistent throughout the book. ie., there are never any quotation marks).<br />The story is a powerfully moving disclosure of the perils of alcoholism. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank's father could not walk PAST a pub, the family would not have been so destitute. What little money Malachy McCourt earns is forever spent on alcohol, and the amazing thing is that it is spent shamelessly. Mother and children practically starve while dad staggers home in a drunken stupor night after night. Frank says of his father's false promises... &quot;He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.&quot;  Injustice.<br />In my opinion, the redeeming majesty of this memoir is that through it we learn a wondrous fact... that shamelessness, irresponsibility, and stupidity do not necessarily have to be handed down to the next generation. Frank broke the mold, and chose self-awareness as his aspiration. I believe that the crucial turning point in his life came when, at the age of eleven he was convalescing at a hospital and came to the conclusion that &quot;it's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.&quot; As readers of Angela's Ashes, we become the grateful recipients of this precocious revelation.<br />Mr. McCourt has received much recognition for his book, and all of it is deserved. I have no idea what he has gained monetarily from its publication, but somehow I think it's a bit more than his aforesaid promised nickel. Way to go.

You will not draw the nectar out of this book unless you are aware (the earlier the better) of James' premise that  the stronghold of religion lies in individuality. These lectures are not a study of &quot;religion&quot; nor even a study of religious &quot;experiences&quot; in toto, but a study of &quot;individual&quot; religious experience. Singular. It sounds narrow only until you add the other word of the title... &quot;varieties.&quot;<br />Why such an emphasis upon the individual? Because, as James states, the pivot around which the religious life revolves &quot;is the interest of the individual in his private personal destiny.&quot; All proper &quot;religion&quot; by such a definition must consist in an individual experiencing connection with that which he considers to be the higher power(s). In fact, at one point James states that &quot;prayer is real religion.&quot; And further, &quot;Wherever this interior prayer is lacking, there is no religion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs the soul, even in the absence of forms or of doctrines, we have living religion.&quot; A thought-provoking principle.<br />You will never appease your hunger by staring at a menu. You have to actually open your mouth and &quot;experience&quot; the eating of some food. Similarly, we can only learn about religious experience by recounting the experiences of those who've done some profound religious eating (so to say). This is James' method. He renounces the ambition to be coercive in his arguments (this is not an apologetic work) and simply focuses on &quot;rehabilitating the element of feeling in religion and subordinating its intellectual part.&quot; He does this by the examination of diverse case histories.<br />And he uses the &quot;extremer examples&quot; because these yield the profounder information. He called these types &quot;theopathic&quot; characters; those who tend to display excess of devotion. His reasoning is thus: &quot;To learn the secrets of any science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be eccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils. We combine what they tell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our final judgment independently.&quot;<br />Concerning this &quot;final judgment&quot; I found the following principle in the lecture entitled &quot;Mysticism&quot; to be particular liberating. As regards the extremely theopathic: &quot;No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically.&quot;  A good word to hide in your heart against the next time some well-intentioned saint feels that their eccentricities should be yours.<br />To be honest, I found the lecture entitled &quot;Philosophy&quot; to be fairly technical and daunting, but such criticism I charge to my own lack of knowledge in this area rather than to any deficiency in the book itself. Upon closing its covers, I was a satiated bee. The book is total nectar.any science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be eccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils.

I've always heard so much about the merits of The Drum, perhaps I was expecting too much from it? The first three or four chapters had me thoroughly absorbed in Oskar's ancestry, and for the rest of the book I kept waiting for someone as interesting and human as his grandmother Anna to show up, but I was to be disappointed. Granted, Oskar's mother Agnes is another consistent and great character, but besides these two... oyvay! Oskar was such an unreal personage that I found him impossible to trust as a narrator... with every beat of his drum he startled the already frightened theme of this book into a corner. I never found that corner. If you enjoy authors who tend to dive in and out of the &quot;fantastic&quot; and the &quot;real&quot; I would recommend you go to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hermann Hesse, or Charles Williams, but for goodness sakes... &quot;keep off the Grass.&quot;	2000-11-06

If we live in a time and place of relative religious freedom, we may say that we &quot;believe in Christ&quot; or that we are &quot;Christian&quot; or that &quot;Jesus is our Saviour&quot; without worrying too much about the impact (on ourselves or others) of our statements. We also have the benefit of retrospect, the canon of Scripture, the established creeds... in short, we know the end of the Christian story.<br />But those who first heard the claims of Christ did not have the privilege of standing back and looking at a completed picture. And so the question arises... What was it about this man Jesus that caused those who spent the most time with him, to come to the conclusion that he was the Son of God? Exactly how radical of a position was this for them to hold? In turn, how radical is it for us?<br />This is what Giussani's book is all about. He shows that &quot;in Christianity it is no longer the person who seeks to know the mystery but the mystery that makes himself known by entering history.&quot; It is a profound study of the process of Christ's self-revelation. In this process, Christ constantly appealed to men's understanding. We learn that the faith that Christ asks of us is not opposed to reason, and the &quot;reason&quot; that Christ intends for us to enjoy, does not preclude faith.<br /> I followed along in my own Bible as I read, and I would encourage all other readers to do the same. You will gain new insights. I especially appreciated the fact that in Giussani's interpretive method, he thoroughly sticks to a crucial exegetical rule which states: Scripture cannot mean to us today, what it could not possibly have meant to its original hearers! He shows that a careful study of the Gospels reveals &quot;belief&quot; as not only the discovery of, but the UNDERSTANDING of, the truth that is proposed to us. As such, when I now say &quot;I believe in Christ&quot; I ought to be able to consider... &quot;Through what cognitive process have I arrived at such a grandiose conclusion?&quot; I know that such questioning will reap great benefits, for it already has. Rather than diminish my faith, it has strengthened it. It is a joy to discover that the claims of Christ can bear intellectual scrutiny.

I think there are only two types of people who need not bother with this book: a) those who are not mortal, and b) those who can't read. All the rest of us should look into it. Rather than duplicate the excellent book description and synopsis above, I will try something else to let you know if this book will interest you at all. Early on in the first chapter, the author makes three statements, and I quote:<br />1) &quot;In simple terms, in our unconscious mind we can only be killed; it is inconceivable to die of a natural cause or of old age.&quot;<br />2) &quot;The more we are making advancements in science, the more we seem to fear and deny the reality of death.&quot;<br />3) &quot;When a patient is severely ill, he is often treated like a person with no right to an opinion.&quot;<br />If those type of blanket statements provoke your interest, or make you want to hear more, then this book is for you, because the author never leaves them in blanket form. The book is an enfleshment of those ideas. The author states her objective very clearly midway through the book by saying &quot;If this book serves no other purpose but to sensitize family members of terminally ill patients and hospital personnel to the implicit communications of dying patients, then it has fulfilled its task.&quot;<br />The book is clearly written, no technical jargon to trip over. I found the whole genesis and history of Kubler Ross's interdisciplinary seminar on death and dying fascinating. The actual patient interviews revealed that (more often than not) the people most willing to TALK about dying are... the dying. I found these interviews for the most part very ennobling. They exalted the human spirit and showed the importance of faith and hope.<br />Above all, the book will make you &quot;think&quot;. I've finished reading it, but I certainly haven't finished thinking about it. And that is always my criteria for the fifth star!	2000-11-03

BNW is the most sobering (and clearest) fictional picture we have of the possibilities inherent in viewing mankind in strictly utilitarian terms. In the nearly seventy years since BNW's first printing, our world has made great strides in the science of biological engineering, oftentimes very overall beneficial strides. It is just such &quot;advancement&quot; however, which makes Brave New World all the more poignant a read in the year 2000 and beyond.

Don't let the dismal fact that this book is twenty-zillionth on the bestseller list discourageth you.... it is well worth orderething.<br />I first came to this book through the published endorsement (hence, not personal) of the great C.S. Lewis, who made his first reading of the Well in November of 1914. He read it many times thereafter.<br />In my ONE reading of the two volumes, I can attest to the fact that this is a beautiful story, a rich fantasy, a vibrant fairy-tale with no fairies. Among other things... a love story. Strictly speaking, as regards genre, it is a &quot;romance&quot;. The chivalric, bardic story of Ralph of Upmeads, the least likely of the King's four sons, who devotes his life to the quest of the Well at The World's End... a fabled well which promises to reward its discoverer with perpetual youth.<br />If you are in love with Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings (and who isn't) you should definitely consider having an affair with The Well At The World's End. Let me defuse the daunting issue of Morris's use of archaic language. Be ye warned, in every sentence you will constantly encounter words such as forsooth, hitherward, quoth, whither, rideth, erstwhile, deem, draweth, betwixt, and I wot not else. At first I thought this would be really intolerable. But I quickly adapted to it, and even found it kind of &quot;not vile&quot;.<br />Remember... Volume 2 is essential. It's NOT a sequel, it's a conclusion. Get both volumes, and escape the world of car horns and remote control for a bit.<br />I applaud this new re-issue of what is definitely a fantasy classic. Previously, one had to search a hundred used-book stores to find it. Now it's a click away.<br />And as regards it's place on the bestseller list? I am reminded of the wise words of the great Henrik Ibsen, who once suggested that &quot;the solid majority is always wrong.&quot;	2000-10-27

Still, if you are at all interested in how the claims of Christianity can speak to the many counter-claims of our modern world, then please try locate this book somewhere. Social scientist Dr. Anthony Campolo here addresses four major areas of secular thought, and shows how Christians can respond to these in an impressive &quot;reasonable&quot; way. These four areas are:<br />Contingency, which claims that everything that exists has a cause which can be scientifically explained.<br />Autonomy, which claims that man shapes his own destiny. There is no God, and man is a law unto himself.<br />Temporality, which claims that all things pass away; in the end there is nothing at all.<br />Relativity, which claims that, if there is no God, anything is permissable. Man establishes his own laws and principles for living.<br />Campolo writes about serious (heavy) matters in an engaging way that is... light, yet filling. Brilliant, witty, gracefully uncompromising, and never boring. I have attended a Campolo conference, listening in amazement as he fielded audience questions and answered them off the cuff. It's near impossible to put one over the wall when Campolo's in the park, but yet one senses the honesty that would respond with an &quot;I don't know&quot; if necessary.<br />He's utterly brilliant, but never pedantic.<br />Try get a hold of this book. It's full of honesty, and no &quot;I don't knows&quot;!	2000-10-26

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, as I have so many of Greene's others... in fact, this one is my favorite so far. For me, a significant theme in the book is that it is very difficult to run away from one's true vocation. In A Burnt-Out Case, the main character Querry tries to do just that. He feels that he has lost the passion he once had for his gifting in architecture, and he tries to run and hide in obscurity... to go into an early retirement. Due to his immense fame, he needs to go far (geographically) to do this; hence, he finds himself at the end of an arduous tsetse-fly infested boat ride in the heart of an isolated leper colony in the Belgian Congo. Here, with the help of the many priests who run the colony, and a nosy journalist thrown into the mix, Querry will find out just how hard the ground is in which he attempts to bury his talents.<br />For a better synopsis of the story, note the Merriam-Webster review above. And since that review gives away the ending anyway, I won't feel so bad about telling you what I considered to be the one (albeit minor) &quot;possible&quot; flaw in the story's denouement. (NOTE: To criticize Graham Greene seriously makes me fearful of the next lightning storm.) However, towards the end, Mme. Rycker has accused Querry of a terrible indiscretion, and this throws her husband into a somewhat understandable fit of rage. The priests also, believing Mme. Rycker's accusations, reject Querry, and he is humiliated and unjustly condemned. Querry knows how serious the situation has now become. But he does not take it seriously. In his defense, he simply claims to Rycker, &quot;I haven't even kissed your wife. She doesn't attract me in that way.&quot;<br />A key fact here is that he is actually telling the truth. Rycker's jealous rage is unjustified. Another key fact is that Mme. Rycker also knows that nothing happened between them, and talks about that fact freely with Querry just minutes after his tumultuous verbal exchange with her husband.<br />I kept asking myself... why didn't Querry arrange this interview with Mme. Rycker at a time and place where Rycker himself could have secretly overheard their conversation? In this way, Rycker could have clearly overheard his wife contradicting the allegations that she had written in her diary! In this way Querry would have cleared his name.<br />Read the book and see if you don't agree with me!<br />The only reason Querry could have logically been as non-concerned about the issue as he was, is because he was so gentlemanly and honorable, he did not want Mme. Rycker to experience the wrath of her husband, and was willing to bear that burden himself. And bear it he did!<br />At any rate, the thought of anyone other than Leo Tolstoy criticising Graham Greene's writing... well, it makes me shudder. And it's cloudy out tonight, so I must go hide.<br />4 and a half stars!her husband. <br />I kept asking myself... why didn't Querry arrange this interview with Mme.

Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia many times in my adult life. And plan to do so again and again. The remarkable thing is that the stories still seem fresh and alive. They never seem to get boring and there are always new insights waiting to be discovered. Even for the adult reader. I would highly recommend the stories to all young readers, even though I myself did not read them as a child. I think I was so bent on trying to read the entire works of Enid Blyton at the time, that I failed to notice anything Narnian about my local library.<br />&quot;New insights&quot; are what the Companion To Narnia is all about. Paul F. Ford has done a wonderful job of assembling all of the myriad of characters, places, themes; all the rich history and lore of Narnia and beyond, into this one encyclopedic book. I really cannot see how it could be improved upon. It is massive in scope. I have read it and &quot;used&quot; it for years now.<br />The book is arranged alphebetically and all topics are meticulously cross-referenced (an asterisk follows any word or phrase which is an entry elsewhere). Even though this is not the type of book that is commonly read from cover to cover, picking it up and starting from any topic will surely tempt you to the reading of the asterisk-linked articles. In Narnian terms, I think of this as the hidden &quot;Turkish-Delight&quot; feature of the book. Let it take you where your curiosity and interest leads.<br />At the end of the articles, Ford has placed in parentheses an abbreviated reference to the specific book and page number that coincides with the topic being discussed. This sends us back to the original source of the material if necessary, and allows Ford's book to be not only a companion, but a sort-of concordance as well. It is a very useful feature.<br />The copious footnotes will definitely appeal to those who are interested in learning more about the creator of Narnia. These notes clearly show that Paul Ford is an expert in his knowledge of the man C.S. Lewis. (A good example is the numerous footnotes to the article entitled &quot;Digory Kurke&quot;).<br />Another great feature of the book is that not only are characters and place-names discussed, but also the IDEAS and THEMES of the Chronicles are examined. For instance there are comprehensive articles on such things as: Dreams, Knowledge, Fear, Privacy, Sounds, Music, Obedience, Birds, Ecology, etc. Of particular worthy mention is the great five page section on Biblical Allusions.<br />The final thing I will mention is that there are wonderful illustrations throughout the book, and these serve to take the imagination even further into the world that is Narnia.<br />The book is appropriately titled. My desk-dictionary has, as one of its definitions for the word companion... &quot;one of a pair of matching things&quot;. In my opinion, any bookshelf that has its Narnia, ought to have its Companion.Ford is an expert in his knowledge of the man C.S. Lewis.

Brendan is the story of a sixth-century Irish monk's quest for &quot;the land of the blessed&quot; the terrestrial Paradise known in Celtic lore as &quot;Tir-na-n-og&quot;. Buechner skillfully takes us to the doorstep of many rich and vibrant lands via Brendan's journeys... and lets us meet with a many-splendored cast of characters, none of which are superfluous. All of these places, and all of the characters play a vital role in both the building up and the tearing down of Brendan. Aside from the sheer beauty of this story, laced as it is with Buechner's unrivalled metaphors (all writers bow)... I feel there are many lessons in the book that further commend it to the realm of worthy reading.<br />It is a book which in the end asks us to come to terms with our own questions we would address to God. Whatever they may be. In the process, we may find that many of those questions have already been answered. Others (perhaps the greater part) never will be. This is normal. Life is mystery.  From the book I think I've learned that our inner search for God can be as much selfishness and pride if it does not work itself out in a love for others and a willingness to extend our &quot;selves&quot; for the purpose of nurturing enlightenment in others.<br />For Brendan, this is a lesson learned in retrospect. And for all of us, I think there is an implication here that theoretical and practical spiritual truth is the fruit of a journey. Bitter if plucked too early; sweet if dropped when ripe. Towards the end of his life Brendan says (refering to God) &quot;Perhaps we've given all but what he truly wants.&quot; And further &quot;He wants us each one to have a loving heart.&quot;<br />It seems that after a life of privation, striving, abstinence, and self-inflicted penance, Brendan finds his greatest spiritual fulfillment comes through his simple practical interactions with common folk (regenerate and unregenerate). The narrator Finn tells us, &quot;Every day and every weather he'd go tramping off in search of them he thought needed succor most.&quot; And further, &quot;Then the same Brendan that once was wont to blather for hours on end of the wonders he'd seen would for a wonder sit silent as a stick while some poor soul spun out his own drab story.&quot;<br />At any rate, through Brendan's life we are afforded a glimpse of the truth that it is not primarily through our good works that we attain peace or favor with ouselves or with God. The life-long friend and narrator, Finn, concludes by saying that if he were Brendan's ultimate judge, &quot;I'd sentence him to have mercy on himself. I'd sentence him less to strive for the glory of God than just to let it swell his sails if it can.&quot; Brendan is the story of a cold soul's migration to warmer climes. And back again. The confusion of the religious genius.<br />If I were some sort of ultimate judge, I'd sentence everyone to a reading of Buechner's book.d go tramping off in search of them he thought needed succor most.&quot; And further, &quot;Then the same Brendan that once was wont to blather for hours on end of the wonders he'd seen would for a wonder sit silent as a stick while some poor soul spun out his own drab story.&quot;<br />At any rate, through Brendan's life we are afforded a glimpse of the truth that it is not primarily through our good works that we attain peace or favor with ouselves or with God.
