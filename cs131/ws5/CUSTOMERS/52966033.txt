Cancer had taken her mother and the IRA had stolen her father and fianc&eacute;. Most shocking of all, the father she barely knew had inexplicably cut her off and left the family farm to others. When her Uncle Fitz sends her a one-way ticket from Ireland to Arizona and asks her to come and live with him at Irish Heaven, his million-dollar ranch, Rhiannon knows this is her chance for a fresh start. Filled with rosy visions of the future, the first inkling of her true situation arrives in the form of a dead cow in the middle of the road and a tall, gorgeous cowboy accusing her of rustling.<br /><br />Actually, the steer (not a cow) turns out to be alive (barely) but that's about the only good news awaiting Rhiannon. Irish Heaven is only worth a million on paper. In reality, the ranch is struggling financially and beset by cattle rustlers, and it's just the foreman, Redhawk Jackson, and her uncle left. Even more troubling, Hawk is letting her know in no uncertain terms that he considers the ranch to be his inheritance, not her's. As for Uncle Fitz, he is slowly succumbing to the insidious effects of Alzheimer's disease with no inclination to reveal who he intends to leave the ranch to. Determined to ease his mind and make a place for herself at Irish Heaven, Rhiannon rolls up her sleeves and dives into ranch life. Now, if only she can cry peace with the surly cowboy who makes her pulse race.<br /><br />Redhawk Jackson is a man all too familiar with loss. A lost childhood followed by troubles with the law, Hawk's life would probably have been much different if not for Fitz O'Brannoch. Hiring him on his ranch when no one else would, Fitz became his mentor, the father he never had. Fitz proudly saw Hawk make a name for himself on the rodeo circuit and gave him a refuge when an accident left him with a bum knee. As foreman of Irish Heaven, Hawk finally knows where he belongs - caring for his fading friend and minding the struggling ranch with the understanding it will be his someday. Now comes this Irish temptress out to steal his inheritance from under him. Hawk isn't having any of it and is determined to ship her back to Ireland. If only he can convince himself that's what he really wants.<br /><br />It's not long before Hawk and Rhiannon find themselves soaking in a water trough and getting under each other's skin. Hawk even proposes a marriage of convenience which Rhiannon vehemently turns down. This battle of the sexes is just beginning and, in the meantime, there's Fitz to care for, rustlers to catch and the emergence of a plot against Irish Heaven to unravel.<br /><br />It is the main characters of HARD CASE COWBOY that bring the story to life. Rhiannon and Hawk have each known loss in its myriad forms and it motivates them to grab what they want, exposing their flaws to each other and their humanity to the reader. The tale starts with the two squaring off against each other but one can see their characters mature and evolve as the various subplots blend together and the story reaches its climax. Other characters provide contrast and texture, especially Fitz' poignant battle with Alzheimer's and the secrets he eventually reveals. Part battle of the sexes, part romantic suspense and pure emotional rollercoaster, HARD CASE COWBOY is one satisfying experience readers won't soon forget.<br /><br />TheSchemerg the struggling ranch with the understanding it will be his someday.

In this world, Daemons do their best to suck out your soul, and the only thing that can save you is a group of raucous, leather-clad immortal warriors with [...] attitudes.  But what happens when lines are crossed and allegiances broken?  There's trouble brewing with the Dark-Hunters in the Mississippi Delta, and Acheron Parthenopaeus, head honcho of the Hunters (and possibly the most intriguing character in romance fiction today), knows the time of the Krisi has come.  Judgment Day.<br /><br />In a world filled with amazing beings, Alexion is truly one of a kind.  Born from the ashes of betrayal, Alexion owes his very existence to Acheron and thus acts as his defender and judgment giver, as well as a second father to Simi, Ash's infamous teenage demon \\"daughter.\\"  Bound by loyalty and necessity to his master, Alexion lives in Katoteros and can only emerge to mete out punishment to rogue Hunters.  Of this creature of rumor and mystery, the Dark-Hunters only know that when the man in the white coat comes, heads are gonna roll.  Literally.<br /><br />Betrayed and killed by her own husband during the French Revolution, Dangereuse St. Richard sold her soul to Artemis for an Act of Vengeance and became a Dark-Huntress.  Unlike the other Hunters, however, Danger prefers a quiet and solitary existence when not dealing with the few Daemons who come her way.  That quiet is shattered when Kyros, one of the first Greek Dark-Hunters, tries to enlist her in a rebellion against Acheron.  Horrified by his accusations about their leader and torn between loyalties, Danger is further alarmed when Ash's \\"squire\\" shows up...wearing a white coat.<br /><br />With the clock ticking towards the Krisi, Danger agrees to help Alexion uncover the source of the unrest and to try and save her fellow Hunters.  Soon their truce turns to passion, and passion turns to love.  But what hope is there for a man with no future and a woman forbidden a family?<br /><br />In a series filled with dramatic twists and turns, SINS OF THE NIGHT is the most extraordinary yet.  In a masterful stroke, Ms. Kenyon has managed to provide a fitting ending for a character who, in any other case, would never have one.  All the elements of an outstanding tale are here:  the wry and funny dialogue, the nail-biting bursts of action, an unforgettable hero and heroine and, most important, the exquisite torment of not knowing HOW it could possibly end well.  And you know what?  Somehow it did.  Amazing work, Ms. Kenyon.<br /><br />TheSchemern a family?    In a series filled with dramatic twists and turns, SINS OF THE NIGHT is the most extraordinary yet.

US	52966033	R2BOEJ8Q1WZ8WW	0743470346	56820294	My Favorite Mistake	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A charming debut	Given a choice, food columnist Faith Geary would rather be undergoing a root canal than be back home in Lindbrook, Minnesota. You see, ten years ago, Faith did a stupid thing. When her first and only true love proposed, Faith panicked and fled for California with another guy -- who actually ended up dumping her, but that's beside the point. Now, thanks to her sister Skye's convoluted love life and failing business (a bar in which Faith has invested all of her life's savings, thank you very much), big sister Faith is back in Lindbrook to fix the mess. Unfortunately, there's one little glitch in Faith's master plan. It seems Skye has a partner at the bar and his name is Patrick Flynn. The same Patrick Flynn Faith had unceremoniously dumped a decade ago. Welcome back, Faith.<br /><br />It's immediately apparent that Flynn has not forgotten nor forgiven Faith for their break-up. But, interestingly enough, it's also obvious that he can't stay away from her, which is a good thing since they have to work together to save the bar and keep Skye out of trouble. Soon the sizzle is back and its time for Faith to stop running and face their past. Can she go home again?<br /><br />Beth Kendrick's debut is a realistic look at the trials and tribulations of a modern day heroine, flaws and all. An intriguing blend of guilt complexes and wry humor, Faith is a career girl who once screwed over her prince charming, but is now determined to make things right and try for another shot at a happily ever after. While not as vividly brought to life as Faith, Flynn comes across as a wary man still hurting from his first love's rejection but not closed off to the idea of a reunion. The secondary characters are a riot and are lovingly detailed, including the irrepressibly flighty Skye, her laconic would-be swain Lars, Faith's former high school rival, Sally, and the various personalities in this quirky town. Charming and laugh out loud funny, MY FAVORITE MISTAKE will have you wishing to go home again too.<br /><br />TheSchemerhome again too. <br /> <br />TheSchemer	2005-09-12

Banishing the countess, the earl also separates the twins and decrees that he and his wife will each raise a son, setting the stage for the bitter rivalry to come nearly three decades later.<br /><br />A young hellion, Matalia McTaver is the eldest daughter of Ronin, Laird of the Clan McTaver, and Kalial, princess of a mystical forest kingdom. Pressured to marry by her parents, who worry about her wild ways, Matalia refuses to settle down but yearns for a taste of the intimacy between men and women. So when she finds a brawny, handsome stranger trussed up in the woods near her home, Matalia figures she's found the perfect partner. Unfortunately, her captive is no tame shepherd to be seduced, but a warrior on a mission of his own.<br /><br />Having spent the last fifteen years amassing a fortune and gaining a fierce reputation in battle, Brogan O'Bannon knows the time has finally come to return to Kirkcaldy and be declared his father's heir. Unfortunately, two things stand in his way. The first is Xanthier, Brogan's identical twin. Raised by their father, Xanthier is his rival and nemesis, but forever connected to Brogan in that special way only twins know. The other problem is the beautiful young woman who rescues him from Xanthier's men only to capture him for use as a stud. Try as he might to resist her allure, Brogan and Matalia give in to desire only to be caught by her father. Bedded then wedded, this fiery pair must now find a way to deal with each other as they journey to Kirkcaldy for the ultimate confrontation with Brogan's father and brother.<br /><br />Back in the 1980's historical romances had a certain tone and texture. They were larger than life, gritty dramas filled with passionate characters who bled, cried, and did things that made readers simultaneously cringe and shiver. Those stories disappeared in the next decade as historicals became kinder, gentler, and more politically correct. Well, guess what? A new age has dawned and everything old is new again, and Sasha Lord's IN A WILD WOOD leads the pack. The story swirls with classic elements like betrayal, rivalry, and regret, topped off with a healthy dose of good, old-fashioned lust. Brogan is very much a man of his time, while Matalia starts off as a young, spoiled girl who matures into a force to be reckoned with. Add in the varied cast of secondary characters and the result is a tale which is intense, believable, and electrifying.<br /><br />The second in the Wild series (the first story, UNDER A WILD SKY, is Ronin and Kalial's story), IN A WILD WOOD can be read apart. But do you really want to miss the rest of this unique family? I highly recommend this book and series for a thrilling romance and an unforgettable adventure.<br /><br />TheSchemerories disappeared in the next decade as historicals became kinder, gentler, and more politically correct.

First, her daughter Persephone, the Goddess of Spring, is all that is beautiful and sweet, but alas, has no interests other than the next bacchanal or frolic with the neighborhood nymphs. Second, the residents of the Underworld are hounding Demeter for the comfort of a goddess, since their king, Hades, has no mate. Positive that Persephone only needs a push in the right direction in order to mature and avoid becoming the Paris Hilton of the Mount Olympus set, Demeter hatches a diabolical plan with an ingenious twist.<br /><br />In the realm of mortals in the land called Tulsa, lives one Carolina Francesca Santoro. Having survived being traded in by a faithless husband for a younger model, Lina has poured her heart and soul into her bakery, Pani del Goddess. Unfortunately, an incompetent accountant threatens to sink the business. Desperate for ideas to save her bakery, Lina discovers an unusual Italian cookbook filled with delicious recipes and mystical incantations. Eager to try one, Lina finds herself making dough and cavorting around her courtyard in the middle of the night invoking the Goddess Demeter. Surprise, surprise, Demeter answers her.<br /><br />Remember that diabolical plan with the ingenious twist? Demeter switches Lina's and Persephone's souls with their bodies. For six months, Persephone will inhabit Lina's body and learn to live and work as a mortal with the guarantee that Pani del Goddess will flourish. In return, Lina must inhabit Persephone's body and go visit the Underworld to show the residents the goddesses have not forsaken them. But Lina cannot reveal her true identity to anyone, especially Hades, Lord of the Underworld.<br /><br />Six months as a goddess, and a young, sexy goddess at that. It all seems so easy until Lina gets an eyeful of Hades. The God of the Dead is supposed to be a curmudgeonly misogynist. The reality is far more dangerous. Hades is dark, brooding, and built like a god. (Okay, so he IS a god, but you get the picture.) He is also honorable, lonely, and romantic. Before long, the Lord of the Dead and the Goddess of Spring are in love. But can their love survive the coming revelations?<br /><br />P.C. Cast has been garnering a reputation for whimsical, humorous fantasy romances, and GODDESS OF SPRING sets it in stone. Ms. Cast upends classical Greek folklore and fashions a modern myth for the ages. Lina is a mature woman who gets to live every woman's fantasy to be a goddess, and she does it with style, charm, and a little magic of her own. A special bond with animals that she's had all her life comes in very handy when confronted by Hades's \\"dread steeds\\" and Cerberus, the three-headed hellhound. In Lina's hands, these animals turn into frisky colts and overgrown puppies and provide some of the story's funniest moments. As for Hades, who knew the God of the Dead could be more romantic than Apollo? After an eternity of solitude, he opens himself to love, knowing that Spring cannot stay. Hades is a truly unique hero, even among the gods. Poignant and provocative, GODDESS OF SPRING will stay with you long after the seasons have passed.<br /><br />TheSchemeruilt like a god.

When the producers for a new reality television show in the UK offer Seattle-based genealogy expert Tessa Riordan the chance to play the role of a Victorian-era duchess for a month, she eagerly accepts. After all, who wouldn't want to live like a pampered lady for a few weeks and get paid big bucks for it? Still saddled with her late husband's medical bills, this is her chance to finally make a fresh start so off she heads for England. However, nerves and self-doubt soon get the best of Tessa and culminates with her losing her lunch all over her handsome leading man at their first meeting.<br /><br />Okay, so it wasn't the best first impression to make on a man, but Max Edgerton sure makes an impression on our intrepid heroine. Max is gorgeous, educated, and available, and for some reason Tessa doesn't understand, he's attracted to her as well. He does, however, come with emotional baggage, a surly teenage daughter and a limelight-hogging sister and brother-in-law, all part of her temporary \\"reality\\" family. Add to that a dysfunctional cast of characters playing the manor servants, a camera crew filming her every move (and casting wagers on Tessa's ability to seduce Max), and a breath-stealing, gas-inducing corset from hell. Tea, anyone?<br /><br />Upstairs Downstairs meets The Osbournes in this funny and charming ode to Reality TV. Tessa is an endearing heroine readers instantly root for as she puts her pride and heart on the line and goes after the wary but captivated Max. Their encounters are both hilarious and passionate, with Tessa prone to blurting out disarmingly provocative statements to a befuddled Max. The rest of the cast are delightful with the \\"servants\\" almost stealing the story. Told in the first person and in the format of a personal journal, THE CORSET DIARIES is an over-the-top romantic comedy sure to leave your jaws aching from laughter.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-09-08

Six years ago, when the mother of his son died and her parents refused him visitation rights, Robert had no choice but to take his boy and leave behind a promising career in astronomy. Today he is Daniel Murphy, owner and operator of Button Creek's one and only gasoline station. Content in his solitary life with Will, Daniel is shaken by his immediate attraction to the new mystery woman working at the diner. Stranger still are the other new characters in their sleepy little town.

Instead it focuses on the poignant relationships that lie at the heart of this charming tale. Daniel is a man willing to do anything for his child, while Zara is a woman who loves deeply but knows the sorrow of parting will come.

Other disgraced debutantes might have gone straight into hiding, but not Bea. Now a dame de compagnie to Arabella, Viscountess Withers -- herself the subject of gossip -- Bea has blossomed into a dazzling sophisticate well-versed in affairs of the heart. Accompanying Arabella to Wiltshire for a house party for her expectant niece, Esme Rawlings, Bea decides to amuse herself by teaching the very proper Helene, the Countess Godwin, how to seduce the very proper Stephen Fairfax-Lacy.<br /><br />Weary of his duties in Parliament, Stephen Fairfax-Lacy accepts an invitation to attend a house party held at the country home of \\"Infamous Esme.\\" He figures a house party filled with beautiful and notorious women will provide him with a new mistress to relieve his ennui. Before long, however, Stephen finds himself swimming in a sea of feminine intrigue and caught in a web between three women: engaged to Esme, designated lover to Helene, and utterly smitten with the ineligible Beatrix. What's a gentleman to do?<br /><br />What if Jane Austen had the sense (and sensibility) of Sex and the City's gal pals? The result just might be something like Eloisa James' A WILD PURSUIT.

Assembled by the Greek goddess Artemis and led by the baddest warrior of all, Acheron Parthenopaeus, each Dark-Hunter began his path to immortality by swearing his soul to Artemis or bartering it in exchange for an Act of Vengeance. This is true for all Dark-Hunters save one...Wulf Tryggvason.<br /><br />Wulf never asked to be a Dark-Hunter. After all, life as a marauding Viking had been exciting enough with all the pillaging and plundering. That all changed, however, when his brother Erik was killed in battle far from their homeland. Seeking comfort for his sorrow, Wulf was seduced by a woman named Morginne. Unfortunately, Morginne wasn't just any woman. She was a servant of Artemis and somehow during their night together, Morginne managed to switch her soul with Wulf's before escaping to join the god Loki. Adding insult to injury, Morginne also laid a terrible curse on Wulf. Except for those who share his bloodline, no human can remember Wulf.<br /><br />So, apart from the fact that he's now forced into eternal servitude to a goddess with permanent PMS, he's watched everyone he loves die through the centuries, and that nobody can ever remember him, life hasn't been too bad for Wulf. His goals are simple enough: get his last living blood relative -- his many times removed grandnephew Chris -- married off and producing more rugrats who can remember Uncle Wulf, and, of course, kill all Daimons. Easy and uncomplicated until the night he finds Cassandra Peters being attacked by a group of Daimons.<br /><br />Although she is half-human, Cassandra Peters is also an Apollite -- a race cursed by the god Apollo to die on their 27th birthday unless they kill a human and steal their soul, thus becoming a Daimon. Cassandra is fast approaching her 27th birthday. If that isn't bad enough, she also happens to be the very last of Apollo's own descendants and Daimons believe that if Cassandra dies, they will be cured. The truth, however, is far, far worse. For if Cassandra dies, so will the sun. Get the picture?<br /><br />After rescuing Cassandra from the Daimons, Wulf figures she will soon forget him and decides to steal a kiss.

Like a princess locked in an ivory tower, dutiful Lady Juliet Cavendish shuns London's society whirl in favor of the study of Ancient Egypt. Well aware of the impossibility of ever seeing the wonders of the pyramids for herself, Juliet has settled into a placid routine documenting her father's growing collection of Egyptian artifacts and attending meetings with fellow scholars. The princess might never have woken up if not for an encounter with an infuriating adventurer named Morgan Beauchamp.<br /><br />A world traveler with a mysterious past, Morgan Beauchamp has gained a reputation for discovering the vestiges of ancient civilizations. Newly returned with a shipment of Egyptian relics for his latest patron, the Earl of Carlisle, Morgan immediately locks horns with the earl's sheltered daughter. Juliet thinks Beauchamp is rude and audacious, which is a pity really, since he's so intriguingly...masculine. He thinks she's a maddeningly opinionated shrew with eyes a man could drown in. But when strange things start to occur, and items from the collection disappear, Morgan and Juliet must put aside their differences to investigate. Can they uncover the curse of the mummy before it gets them?<br /><br />If books came with a soundtrack Deborah Simmons' A LADY OF DISTINCTION would probably be playing Indiana Jones' theme in the background. Morgan and Juliet are well-matched, striking sparks off each other at every encounter -- the daring rogue an ideal foil for the princess trying to escape her tower. The story proceeds at a brisk pace, with several secondary characters providing depth and adding twists and turns in this action-packed adventure that sweeps readers from Regency London to the long-lost tombs Egypt's pharaohs. The only thing missing is the bull whip.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-09-08

Designed and created specifically for warfare, 24th century warlord Baran Arvid has had one goal for the last twenty years -- revenge on those responsible for the death of his teammates and the woman he loved. But before he can embark on his final mission against General Jutka, Baran is tapped for a special mission: find and kill Kalig Druas, a time-traveling psychopathic killer responsible for some of the most heinous murders in history. Given few clues by his superiors, who fear a time paradox, Baran arrives in present-day South Carolina with his partner, Freika. His primary objective: find and protect Jane Colby, for she is destined to be Druas' victim.<br /><br />Jane Colby thought she'd seen it all. As a reporter and small town newspaper owner, she has reported on every conceivable type of story, including what looks to be a vicious serial murderer of women. But nothing could have prepared Jane for the larger-than-life warrior from the future who suddenly appears in her bedroom saying Jack the Ripper is actually a time-traveling maniac who will be coming for her. It is almost laughable until Jane meets He-Man's partner -- a talking timber wolf with a computer for a brain and a fiendish talent for traumatizing her cat, Octopussy. Big, buff and gorgeous, Baran has Jane fearing for her life while secretly fantasizing about being a love slave. Since she's only human (and he IS enhanced), Jane and Baran quickly give in to their explosive passion, well aware that the clock is ticking. For even if Druas is defeated, time will literally rip them apart.<br /><br />Long a favorite of electronic books and erotic romance readers, Angela Knight has truly come into her own with JANE'S WARLORD. Famous for her highly sexed, extremely dominant heroes, Ms. Knight has tempered the qualities that have made her so beloved and created an unforgettable hero. Baran may be dark and dominant, but he has the soul of a poet and the heart of a true romantic. He may have come to rescue Jane, but he finds his salvation in her arms. The rest of the characters provide a perfect foil for this dynamic duo, running the gamut from the truly evil Druas and the scene-stealing Freika to the would-be lupine snack, Octopussy the cat.<br /><br />Lots of action, lots of romance, and yes, lots of sex!

The eldest of the Wilson sisters, Sophia, married a duke. Now, it is middle sister Clara's turn in the London Marriage Mart.<br /><br />Two years ago, Clara Wilson was almost ruined when a fortune hunter lured her into an elopement. Saved by her father in the nick of time, Clara has done her best since to quell her longing for romance and adventure. All her best intentions go out the window, however, when she inadvertently attends an illicit ball and meets a seductive masked man.<br /><br />Burned by love years ago, Seger Wolfe, the Marquess of Rawdon, has long forsaken the ballrooms of polite society. That changes, however, when he encounters a bewitching American at a Cakras Ball. Realizing she is an innocent in the wrong place, Seger rescues her from certain social ruin but not before stealing a kiss. Thinking he will never see her again, Seger is surprised when she shows up again -- this time in disguise -- and admits her attraction. Soon the rakish marquess and the daring debutante are indulging in naughty correspondence and a heated flirtation. Will this audacious miss find true love before scandal catches up with her?<br /><br />Returning to the ballrooms and salons of the Gilded Age, Julianne MacLean's sophomore effort is a worthy follow up to last year's TO MARRY THE DUKE. Seger and Clara are well matched and their heated encounters, and delicious repartee bring this tale to life. But it should be pointed out that given the era in which this story takes place, when wealthy heiresses were better protected than Fort Knox, Clara's behavior at times was more foolish and rash than charmingly intrepid. However, this departure from reality detracts little from the story as a whole.<br /><br />With its intriguing characters and surprise-laden plot, AN AFFAIR MOST WICKED should garner Ms. MacLean many new fans.<br /><br />TheSchemerr /> <br />TheSchemer	2005-09-08

Welcome to the world of Sherrilyn Kenyon, where gods are spoiled brats, demons run loose, and testosterone-fueled, leather-clad bad boys keep the monsters at bay. While most of Kenyon's Hunter Legends stories so far have involved the ass-kicking Dark-Hunters, NIGHT PLAY shifts the focus to the equally yummy Were-Hunters.<br /><br />The Were-Hunters are actually two separate and distinct species created by an ancient sorcerer king determined to save his two sons from dying of the Apollite curse on their twenty-seventh birthdays. Splicing the essence of powerful animals such as bears, wolves, and even dragons with that of the Apollites, the Arcadians and Katagaria were born. While the Katagaria had the hearts of the animal and the Arcadians that of humans, they were two halves of a whole and should have lived together in harmony, far stronger and with a life expectancy much longer than any race before. However, the gods were displeased and wanted them destroyed. When the king refused, the gods decreed the two species would never know peace and planted mistrust between them. Soon, suspicion between Arcadians and Katagaria turned into hate, and hatred into open war. A war that continues to this day...as Vane Kattalakis knows only too well.<br /><br />Born from the forced mating by his Katagari father on his Arcadian mother, hybrid Were-Hunter Vane Kattalakis has spent a lifetime being rejected and feared by everyone except his brother, Fang, and sister, Anya. But when Daemons attack his wolf pack and kill Anya in retaliation for Vane helping the Dark-Hunters, the two brothers are sentenced to death by their own father. Barely escaping with a grievously wounded Fang, Vane lays low at Sanctuary in New Orleans, waiting for his brother to recover and knowing it's just a matter of time before assassins come for them. The last thing Vane expects is to find his destined mate, a human female at that.<br /><br />Was it because she'd just been dumped by her boyfriend via FedEx? Perhaps it was a case of temporary insanity? Whatever the cause, when the most gorgeous man she's ever seen walks into her store, buys her favorite necklace, and presents it to her as a present, shopkeeper Bride McTierney throws caution to the wind and has an unforgettable afternoon tryst with the mysterious Vane Kattalakis. Convinced it was just a fling, Bride's life takes a detour into the Twilight Zone when she suddenly acquires a new pet wolf, and Vane returns determined to woo her. Is he for real?<br /><br />With a three-week deadline to make Bride his mate or else live the rest of her lifetime in celibacy -- so NOT an option -- Vane must win the girl, confess he's her new pet wolf, and, oh by the way, there's a death warrant out for his hide. That's nothing this wolf can't handle, expect for one tiny problem. Practical Bride doesn't believe in the supernatural. Yep, love bites.<br /><br />Once again, Sherrilyn Kenyon adds another intriguing layer to her popular series. Brimming with ancient cultural nuances and spiked with classic Shakespearean pathos, NIGHT PLAY is nevertheless a very modern tale packed with Kenyon's highly irreverent humor. Vane and Bride are a fun pair. He's a little bit hairy; she's a little bit paranoid. Actually, you'd worry too if you weren't sure what kind of offspring you'd produce. Vane's family squabbles redefine the word \\"dysfunctional,\\" while the Dark-Hunters provide some of the best comic moments with their \\"dating tips\\" for the clueless Were-Hunter.<br /><br />Hot, sexy, and fun, NIGHT PLAY is just the perfect summer read to sink your teeth (or fangs) into.

Lovingly conceived and designed by Frank Foster and his daughter Rachel for his best friend, billionaire Thaddeus Lakeman, Sub Rosa is where Frank takes his own life after killing his wife and Thadd when he finds them together. Devastated by the tragedy, for the last three years Rachel has shunned her profession and the house she helped build. Now, however, a recently discovered box left by her father uncovers a dark secret -- many of the gifts given to Rachel and her sister Willow by their father and Thadd are stolen goods worth millions. Determined to protect Willow's fast-track law career, Rachel decides to return the stolen treasures to Sub Rosa, but she must act fast, for Thaddeus Lakeman's long-lost heir is due to arrive soon.<br /><br />Professional adventurer, hunter, and salvager Keenan Oakes has long enjoyed traveling the world on his schooner, the Six-to-One Odds, with his little girl Mikaela, her pet wolf Mickey, and his loyal but motley crew. Arriving at Sub Rosa to begin a new adventure, Keenan quickly realizes he has an intruder -- a beautiful female who deviously disables him and mysteriously disappears. By the time he and his men figure out who she is and arrive to confront her, they find a barely conscious Rachel, badly hurt during her rushed escape. Determined to find out what she's up to, Keenan shanghais the helpless Rachel back to Sub Rosa where he can keep an eye on her. Now Keenan's \\"houseguest,\\" Rachel tries to complete her mission even as she fights their growing attraction. If that isn't bad enough, things get even more complicated when items from Thaddeus Lakeman's legitimate art collection come up missing. What is going on?<br /><br />In Latin Sub Rosa means Beneath the Roses or perhaps secrets buried deep, a perfect description for the two lead characters in Janet Chapman's THE SEDUCTIVE IMPOSTOR. Keenan and Rachel make an instant connection, but each hides secrets from the other, and the twists and turns their relationship take will keep readers on their toes. While the plot's central theme revolves around stolen treasures, the heart of the story is the relationships: a man and a woman falling in love, two sisters united against a tragic past, a young child and her group of adoring \\"uncles,\\" and even a wolf bonding with his master's woman.

But Tori's carefree life changes forever when the Serendipity goes down during a storm in the South Pacific, taking her father to his watery grave. Tori, her gravely injured mother, and Cammy are the only ones to survive, washing ashore on a deserted island. When it becomes clear her mother will not survive, she makes Tori promise never to give up hope that her grandfather will send someone to find her. But eight years pass in their paradise prison, and the few times sailors have come upon their island, rescue was not their goal. Now wary of men, Tori is determined to elude the latest batch who've arrived on their shores.<br /><br />Like everyone else in England, Grant Sutherland and his crew are well acquainted with the tragic story of the Earl of Belmont's family. Although his son, daughter-in-law, and only grandchild were presumed lost at sea nearly a decade ago, the elderly earl refuses to believe they are dead and has beggared himself sending out countless search parties. Commissioned by the ailing nobleman to do one last search, in exchange for the earl's estate after he dies, Grant has almost given up when he sees a beautiful young woman running on the beach of an isolated island. Convinced he has found the missing Dearbournes, Grant quickly mobilizes a team to go ashore and retrieve the survivors.<br /><br />Instead of being greeted by grateful castaways wanting to leave, Grant and his men find themselves outmaneuvered time and time again by their quarry. For Grant, frustration gives way to respect, along with a growing attraction for this impetuous island woman. The feeling is mutual for Tori, and gradually she comes to believe that rescue finally has come. It is on the voyage back to England that the awareness between captain and passenger finally explodes into passion. But while Tori unabashedly revels in their intimacy, Grant finds himself torn between logic and desire. Having seen how love had nearly destroyed one brother and killed another, Grant has sworn never to care too deeply for a woman.

Now these wary lovers must learn to find a way back to each other even as they seek the truth behind Lucien's ordeal.<br /><br />THREE NIGHTS... is a passionate, engrossing tale with intriguing twists and turns at every corner. Lucien is an interesting hero, one toughened but not broken by his life experiences, while Aveline defies the \\"maiden in distress\\" stereotype by daring to barter herself sexually and growing stronger by dealing with the aftermath. While the hero and heroine each have flaws, they come together to create a dynamic unit.

Octavia's parents married while North's did not. Growing up together in the backstages of Covent Garden, North and Octavia shared their dreams and hopes for the future. He dreamed of acceptance in his father's world, while she yearned for a secure future. But just as their childhood camaderie turned to something deeper, Octavia's grandfather, Lord Spinton, decided to acknowledge his granddaughter. To ensure her acceptance in her grandfather's world, North relinquished all contact with his \\"Vie.\\"<br /><br />Turning his back on the world that won't accept him, North begins a career in law enforcement. Twelve years later, he has made a name for himself, first as a Bow Street Runner, then with his own investigative firm. The society that he once dreamed of joining now welcomes him with open arms. During an investigation at a ton party, North encounters Octavia again.<br /><br />For the past dozen years, Octavia has tried to mold herself into the lady her grandfather envisioned. Hiding her true self behind a practiced demeanor, she has yet to bring herself to fulfill her grandfather's last request: to marry the new Lord Spinton. Adding to Octavia's doubts is her reaction to seeing her beloved \\"Norrie\\" again. When her would-be fianc&eacute; asks North to investigate some mysterious letters Octavia is receiving, both believe it is their chance to finally lay their past to rest and say their final farewells. But can a love that has survived a dozen years apart really end?<br /><br />The second in Kathryn Smith's series about the intriguing Ryland brothers, IN YOUR ARMS AGAIN is a poignant love story driven by the internal conflict of the main characters. North is a noble, strong-willed hero with one flaw -- his inability to envision a future with the woman he loves. Octavia is a vibrant, passionate woman slowly suffocating under the weight of everyone's expectations. While their situation is poignant and heartfelt, it seems to drag on just a tad too long. Several secondary characters add depth and a sometimes welcome diversion, especially the rest of the Ryland siblings, whose stories I can't wait to read.

For Michael Stirling, it happens the first time he lays eyes on beautiful Francesca Bridgerton. Unfortunately, she is already in love with someone else. In fact, three days later, Michael watches as Francesca marries his cousin and best friend, John. Since he loves his cousin like a brother, Michael buries his feelings and deliberately cultivates a reputation as a charming ladies' man. Ironically, he also becomes the best friend of the woman he loves. Then tragedy strikes, suddenly and without warning.<br /><br />On a rainy day shortly before his second anniversary, John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin, lays down for a nap and never wakes up. His death shatters the two people he loved most and changes their lives forever. For Francesca, the loss is compounded by a miscarriage a few weeks later. But when she turns to Michael for comfort, she finds her best friend gone and a distant stranger in his place. Unaware of his feelings for her, Francesca has no idea of the guilt Michael is feeling. Guilt that while John lies cold in his grave, Michael has inherited the earldom; guilt that, constantly in his mind, is the knowledge that Francesca is now free. Unable to offer comfort and finding the thought of stepping into his cousin's shoes unbearable, Michael bolts for India and leaves the management of the estates in Francesca's hands.<br /><br />Four years pass, and Francesca now longs for a child of her own. That, of course, means that she will have to reenter the \\"Marriage Mart\\" to secure a father for her future progeny. Arriving in London a few weeks early to get a head start on her plans, the last person she expects to find in the library is the long-missing new earl. For Michael, India has served its purpose. Yes, he still loves Francesca, but that is a secret he will carry to his grave. Perhaps now that he is back, they can somehow go back to their former camaraderie. But these two long-lost friends are about to discover that fate has something else in mind for them.<br /><br />Famous for the lighthearted touch she brings to her books, Julia Quinn shows us another side with this beautiful, poignant story. Intense doesn't begin to describe the emotional impact as readers get to know the three major characters -- Michael, Francesca, and John. Francesca is a woman convinced that she's had her one great love, and she must now come to grips with her growing feelings for a man she always considered a friend. Michael is a complex man torn between feelings of guilt and a desire to finally grab his chance at happiness. Although he appears only in the first few chapters, the reader can almost sense John as a benevolent specter in the background, slowly guiding the two people he loved toward each other.

After years of submitting to diets and various exercise regimens decreed by her plastic surgeon fianc&eacute;, Rachel snaps when David announces he's had a vasectomy without even discussing it with her.  After making a bonfire of her Butt Buster and his collection of vitamins and Rogaine, Rachel decides to follow up on a recent letter she's received from her Cajun relatives.  Hitting the road in a bright red classic pickup truck, Rachel heads for Bayou Black in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana.  Picturing a gracious, elderly grandmother in a Plantation house setting, Rachel arrives to find a log cabin on stilts surrounded by racks of various freshly skinned animals.  Oh dear.  As for that kindly grandmother of her imagination?  The witchy looking Gizelle Fortier is holding a gun on two very fine looking men and one of them is looking at Rachel like she was dessert.  Oh my.<br /><br />Thanks to his father's tomcatting ways, there is no love lost between the LeDeuxs and Fortiers.  Unfortunately, if he is going to make a go of his new helicopter business, Remy LeDeux needs old Gizelle to sell him some of her land.  When he and his brother Luc arrive to talk business, however, the old woman meets them with rifle in hand.  Just as things get dicey, a red pickup truck arrives and out comes a vision that leaves Remy thunderstruck and his Tante Lulu whispering thanks to St. Jude.  But can this sizzling attraction survive this bayou family feud and other secrets yet to be revealed?<br /><br />A sequel to the very popular THE LOVE POTION (Luc's story), TALL, DARK, AND CAJUN is a rootin', tootin' blast.  The story is rife with humor and Southern charm (not to mention idiosyncrasies that are mind boggling to this Yankee reviewer), but there are also moments of poignant intimacy to be found.  The characters are loud and larger than life from tiny Tante Lulu with her ever changing wardrobe (the description of the Madonna t-shirt complete with cone breastcups is engraved in my memory) and hair color to Rachel's cousin Beau with his mullet cut and wrestling aspirations.  Ironically, my one problem with this book is the behavior of its hero and heroine at a critical juncture in the story.  Their behavior rang false especially Rachel's.

Although claimed by Kieran, Isobail swore to Ewan that it was he she loved and convinced him to run away with her to England. Once they got there, however, she quickly showed her true colors and admitted that she had only used him to get to her true lover -- an English knight.

When she learns of Ewan's tragic history, Nora is horrified at the similarities to her own situation and decides to make it up to Ewan by introducing some joy into his life.

Eager to make a fresh start with his countess, Jared is thrown for a loop when he arrives at his estate to find his personal hunting lodge turned into a hotel currently catering a sporting tournament. And his barely remembered bride? She's turned out to be smart, beautiful, and has no idea who he is. Deciding some reconnaisance is called for, Jared decides not to reveal his real identity just yet.<br /><br />Her husband was coming home and the time of reckoning was at hand for Kathryn Westbrooke n&eacute;e Trafford. Left to her own devices by a husband she can barely remember, Kathryn has devoted herself to helping those suffering from the great potato famine in Ireland. Not only has she taken in several orphans and used her husband's estate to raise funds, Kathryn is leading a secret life few know of. When an attractive gentleman unexpectedly arrives claiming to have a reservation, Kathryn is forced to put him up and somehow finds herself continuously running into him. However, the tables are soon turned when Kathryn realizes who her mystery guest is.<br /><br />The first in Linda Needham's Gentleman Rogues trilogy, THE PLEASURE OF HER KISS tries for an interesting premise but never manages to rise above its flaws. While Kathryn is supposed to be an independent and strong-willed heroine, more often than not she comes across as abrasive and manipulative. The question at the heart of this story is never answered. Why? Why does Kathryn embrace the cause of famine relief so vehemently, to the point that she breaks the law? She isn't Irish, nor does she have any Irish relatives or friends, other than those she meets after she gets involved. Given the absence of an answer, she's a bleeding heart who's out of control. As for the hero, it's hard to like one that seems to take a back seat to such an overpowering heroine. Given the time period and the setting of this story, Jared's continuous acceptance of Kathryn's actions is just one more discordant note in an already uneasy mix.<br /><br />Sadly, Ms. Needham has once again fallen into the trap that awaits writers of historical romance, characters who just don't belong in their settings.

Back in high school, the object of Anne Marie's youthful fantasies had been an Italian exchange student, Giovanni. Over twenty years later, Anne Marie arrives in Sorrento, Italy to meet a grown-up Giovanni and have a grand adventure. However, the tall, dark stranger waiting for her isn't her long-lost love.<br /><br />Government agent Marco Moretti has professional and private reasons for wanting to nab the elusive Giovanni. For most of their lives, Giovanni and Marco have been rivals; now they are on opposite sides of the law. Giovanni is part of an international diamond smuggling ring, and Marco's sources have named the American woman as the latest courier. Pretending to be a tour guide who can't take the word \\"no,\\" Marco sticks to Anne Marie as she rambles through the Italian countryside.<br /><br />The true star of THAT'S AMORE is the setting. The small towns of Italy come to life in Carol Grace's descriptions -- from the taste of a tomato freshly plucked from a vine to an evening of opera in a town square. The characters, however, are another story. While I applaud that this book features a slightly older hero and heroine than the norm, Anne Marie comes across with more naivet&eacute; than the average 20 year old. Between her penchant for crying at the drop of a hat and Marco's constant musings about the direction in which his life is heading, this reviewer found it hard to believe that the hero is forty and the heroine, forty-one. Ironically enough, it is the mysterious Giovanni who is the most intriguing character of all.<br /><br />Regardless of its flaws, Carol Grace's THAT'S AMORE is still interesting enough to warrant a look, especially for those who love all things Italian.

Can this intrepid American melt her husband's British control and heal his wary soul?<br /><br />In the first book of a series featuring American heiresses in England, Julianne MacLean has skillfully fashioned a romantic tale of redemption and hope and set it in the lush landscape of the Gilded Age. While Sophia is an admirable heroine who matures from a young, idealistic girl into a strong, determined woman during the course of the story, James's behavior comes across as erratic in his inner struggle to overcome the demons of his past.

Faced with poverty and -- even worse -- the thought of returning to her cousin, Lucy seeks advice from a new acquaintance, the Countess of Sealey. While the elderly lady promises to keep her ears open for anyone seeking a companion, it is the countess's naughty recommendation that Lucy seek a lover that lingers in her mind as she heads home.<br /><br />Nicholas Ramsey, the Viscount Richmond, has carefully crafted a scandalous reputation in order to conceal his secret activities. Commissioned by the Prince Regent to oversee the purchase and shipment of the fabulous Royal Ruby of Mandalay, otherwise known as the Scarlet Widow, from India to England, Nicholas asked his friend and fellow agent, Victor Montat, to bring the priceless jewel to London. On the very evening that Victor arrives on English soil, however, he is murdered and the Scarlet Widow stolen. Fearing the scandal it might bring down on his head if the theft is revealed, Prinny has asked Nicholas to find the jewel and find it fast. Nicholas's investigation has led him to identify Stanley Contrain as someone involved in the theft. Eager to avenge his friend's murder and recover the jewel, Nicholas arrives at the Contrain residence just in time to stop a couple of thugs who are harassing the Widow Contrain.<br /><br />Lucy's gratitude for her rescuer's help in getting rid of the a creditor's bullies quickly turns to outrage when he introduces himself and declares he needs her. Well aware of the viscount's womanizing reputation, Lucy is at first suspicious of his intentions. But when Nicholas takes her into his confidence and reveals that there is a reward for the safe delivery of the Scarlet Widow to the Prince Regent, the intrepid (and desperate) Lucy knows this is last her chance to escape a life of penury and declares she will help Nicholas find the jewel and bring the murderers to justice. As the pair slowly unravel the mystery of the Scarlet Widow, their close \\"professional\\" relationship quickly escalates into a fiery attraction. However, the closer they get to the truth, the more danger seems to stalk them.<br /><br />Nicole Byrd continues to make a name for herself in romance fiction and WIDOW IN SCARLET is a fine example of her talent. The feeling of suspense surrounding the theft of the Scarlet Widow is a perfect complement to the growing relationship between the lead characters. While Lucy is a clear character to read from the start, Nicholas is a compelling hero whose facets are slowly revealed along with his tragic past. As always, it is fun to run into historical figures in books, and Prinny doesn't disappoint in his cameo. Well-paced, suspenseful and romantic, WIDOW IN SCARLET should garner Ms. Byrd many more fans.<br /><br />TheSchemerand reveals that there is a reward for the safe delivery of the Scarlet Widow to the Prince Regent, the intrepid (and desperate) Lucy knows this is last her chance to escape a life of penury and declares she will help Nicholas find the jewel and bring the murderers to justice.

In Sherrilyn Kenyon's alternate reality, gods exist and demons stalk the earth preying on humans.  However, Artemis -- of Mount Olympus fame -- has set up her own commando team of immortal warriors to kick daimon butt and protect the fragile humans.  Led by the ever intriguing Acheron Parthenopaeus, the Dark Hunters are rowdy, gorgeous and sometimes even slightly insane.  But each of them is bigger than life and each has a story to tell.  NIGHT EMBRACE is Talon's tale.<br /><br />Talon of the Morrigantes is a Dark Hunter with a particularly painful past.  The son of a forbidden union between a Celtic Queen and a Druid High Priest, he had overcome tragedy and hardship to become leader of his clan only to have them betray him and his sister.  Bargaining his soul to Artemis for revenge, Talon has now spent hundreds of years as a Dark Hunter and caring for no one.  That all changes one night in New Orleans when he runs into a runaway float and Sunshine Runningwolf.<br /><br />An unconventional artist with a soft spot for bad boys, Sunny couldn't just leave the hurt stranger on the street.  When he refuses to go to the hospital and falls unconscious, she decides to take him home and nurse him.  Given his unnatural ability to heal fast and her instant attraction to his amazing, tatooed body, Sunshine and Talon quickly give in to temptation and embark on a sizzling affair.  What the two don't know, however, is that there is more at work than hormones gone amuck.  Evil forces are at work and Sunny and Talon are part of an intricate plot to bring down the Dark Hunters and unleash chaos on the world.<br /><br />Thousand-year old vendettas, reincarnation, wicked gods bent on conquering the world and testosterone-laden immortals behaving badly.  These are just some of the plots that interweave through NIGHT EMBRACE and it is a blast!  This entry into the world of the Dark Hunters and assorted creatures is darker and more elaborate than the previous books (FANTASY LOVER, NIGHT PLEASURES).  While its core story revolves around Talon and Sunny and their preordained love with its accompanying complications, readers are introduced at a frenetic pace to new characters and intriguing bombshells that are sure to unfold in future books.<br /><br />TheSchemerIGHT PLEASURES).

After getting fired for refusing her boss's umpteenth sexual advance and being blessed by a pigeon, she comes home to find her fianc&eacute; in the midst of a m&eacute;nage a trois with their landlady and another man.  Fleeing to Golden Gate Park to contemplate her future, Alice decides that she's had it with men, even though she still secretly yearns for a strong, masterful man who will dominate her body and soul.  But just as she is about to leave the park, Alice spots a flash of white beside a tree and, feeling a strong compulsion to investigate, finds a white, lop-eared rabbit.  Just as she approaches the bunny, however, it morphs into a white tiger! (Holy Siegfried and Roy!  Sorry, couldn't resist.)  Reeling in shock, Alice stumbles backward, falls down a void and -- like any self-respecting heroine does in a fairy tale -- promptly passes out.<br /><br />For almost two decades, King Jarronn and his brothers have sought to end the spell their evil sister Mikaela has cast on the women of Tarok, rendering them unable to conceive.  Now, however, the sorceress Kalina decrees there is hope for the future -- if each of the four royal brothers chooses a bride from another world.  As the Ruler of the Kingdom of Heart and High King of Tarok, Jarronn has chosen first, and now that the fair Alice has entered his realm, he looks forward to introducing her to the ways of his world.<br /><br />From the moment her eyes open in this new land, Alice knows she's not in Kansas...er, San Francisco, anymore.  Heck, she's not even on Earth!  The clouds in the sky are green and blue, the fauna and flora are all different and, oh yeah, the natives run around naked, wearing chains and getting flogged.  Then there's Jarronn, a man straight out of her wildest dream, who wants her to call him Milord as he trains her to be a good little Submissive.  Trapped in a bondage fantasyland, Alice is about to fulfill every one of her innermost fantasies...and then some.<br /><br />Take a dash of fairy tale, add a sprinkle of fantasy and pour on the kink and you end up in Cheyenne McCray's Wonderland, where naughty things happen to those who beg for it.

Playing a femme fatale secret agent and acting out scenes with a gorgeous actor playing her favorite hero should have been a dream come true. Halfway through her stay, however, Marianne is bored silly and sneaks off into an off-limits part of the island. In the midst of blowing up sand castles to amuse himself while on a forced leave of advance, BAD (short for the Bureau of American Defense, a secret government agency) agent Kyle Foster spots and rescues a woman on the beach just as the explosives are about to go off. Instant attraction springs between Kyle and Marianne, but she is quickly whisked away by her contest sponsors. Determined to see her again, Kyle decides to add a wildcard (namely himself) into her scripted fantasy. Soon the two are on the run and falling in love -- but is it the real thing or just a product of their imagination?<br /><br />Loving thy neighbor reaches new heights in Liz Carlyle's LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX. While her new talk show may be gathering momentum, Dr. Delia Sydney's real life is a shambles. Recently divorced, Delia has been left with a huge monstrosity of a house she can't afford, a barely working car, and -- after all her trees are cut down by the power company -- an unobstructed view of her maddeningly sexy neighbor's house. Nick Woodruff isn't looking to get involved, but he can't get the very sexy Delia out of his mind. He's hooked either listening to her dole out sexual advice on her radio program or watching her climb out of her car wearing what has to be the world's sexiest pair of heels. Determined to act like mature, horny adults, Nick and Delia decide to have a discreet, commitment-free, no holds barred, spanking optional sexual liaison. But when their hot, secret affair shows no signs of cooling off months later, a panicking Delia is set to do something that will change the stakes.<br /><br />Nicole Camden's THE NEKKID TRUTH introduces us to a heroine with a very unusual condition. Years earlier, photographer Debbie Valley was struck by a patrol car and ended up in a weeks-long coma. When she awoke, Debbie no longer had the ability to recognize and remember faces, including her own. Today a successful photographer specializing in nudes, Debbie also continues to work for the San Diego police department on crime scenes -- a job originally arranged for her by the enigmatic Detective Marshall Scott, her nemesis and long the object of her desires. For years, Marshall has felt guilty for being unable to stop the accident that caused Debbie's injury. Standing aside as she dated his fellow officers, Marshall has long thought of her as off limits. That all changes when a new murder investigation forces them to work together and long suppressed feelings are finally released. As they hunt a murderer on the loose, it's up to Marshall to convince the woman he loves that her malady doesn't matter to him.<br /><br />Passion in all its toe-curling, shiver-inducing diversity is explored in BIG GUNS OUT OF UNIFORM and the result is a sensual feast for readers. Sherrilyn Kenyon starts her new BAD series off with a bang (literally) with this fun frolic in the sun. Although not as emotionally satisfying as her longer titles, Ms. Kenyon's tale is full of the wacky humor and larger than life characters that have become her trademark. Meanwhile, historical author Liz Carlyle's first contemporary tale is a sizzling treat that should leave readers hot, bothered, and raring to go shoe shopping, while Nicole Camden makes a remarkable debut with a strong story featuring a truly unique heroine.<br /><br />TheSchemeria is set to do something that will change the stakes. <br /> <br />Nicole Camden's THE NEKKID TRUTH introduces us to a heroine with a very unusual condition.

They are a band of immortal warriors who battle the daimons plaguing Mankind. Created by the Greek goddess Artemis and led by the mysterious Acheron, each Hunter has a story to tell and none more heartbreaking than Zarek of Moesia.<br /><br />Zarek was mad, bad and more than a little insane, and now everyone wants him dead. But hey, that was nothing new to this bad-ass loner. Born the bastard son of a Roman nobleman and a Greek slave, Zarek had known a lifetime of abuse, torture and humiliation. Things didn't get much better once he became a Dark-Hunter. Blamed for the slaughter of a village he was supposed to protect, it was only Acheron's interference that saved him from Artemis's wrath. Unfortunately, his punishment was banishment to the wilds of Alaska -- for 900 years. Now, with his latest assignment gone badly, it is open season on Zarek. Barely escaping after an encounter with Artemis's personal assassin, Zarek passes out only to awaken in a log cabin with a beautiful blind woman and her pet wolf in the middle of a blizzard. Talk about rotten timing.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Zarek, back at Mt. Olympus, Acheron buys him some time by asking that Zarek be given a proper judgment. Archeron's choice of justice nymph is unusual, however. For Astrid, the younger sister of the Three Fates, has never judged a man innocent, not even the man she loved. Nevertheless, the task is accepted and a temporarily blinded (remember the old adage \\"justice is blind?\\") Astrid is now snowbound in Alaska, along with her shapeshifting companion, Sasha, and one very surly Dark-Hunter. At first convinced that Zarek is beyond salvation, Astrid soon changes her mind when she discovers the horrors of his past and the wounded heart he hides from the world. However, will she find enough to absolve Zarek of the terrible crimes he is accused of?<br /><br />From the very first page DANCE WITH THE DEVIL grabs your heart and never lets go. With the exception of the ever-intriguing-please-please-tell-his-story-already Acheron, Zarek is Sherrilyn Kenyon's most complex character to date. A lifetime (and then some) of rejection has forged him into a killing machine with a kick-ass demeanor and a truly warped sense of humor. It takes a very special woman to see past that hostility and find the lost, unloved boy inside. Happily, Astrid is such a woman (or demigoddess, actually). Her empathy, patience and unconditional love make the perfect foil for Zarek's personal demons. They truly are a match made in heaven -- or should I say Mt. Olympus?<br /><br />Not only does Ms. Kenyon possess the ability to make her readers laugh and cry at the same time, she is also a genius at plotting out stories. The brief glimpses we see into the dysfunctional relationship between Artemis and Acheron whets the appetite, while the introduction of characters like Sasha, Syra of Antikabe and Spawn ensures that this series will be around a long, long time. Powerful and unforgettable, DANCE WITH THE DEVIL is my pick for Best Paranormal of the Year.<br /><br />TheSchemertriguing-please-please-tell-his-story-already Acheron, Zarek is Sherrilyn Kenyon's most complex character to date.

Newly returned to London, Daniel is determined to secure the succession away from his wastrel cousin and finding a proper, demure young lady to become his countess. Since it also happens to be his sister Gretchen's first season, the new earl intends to see her settled in a proper match as well. However, Daniel's carefully laden plans fly out the window when his sister is brought home by a bewitching young woman with an outrageous tale.<br /><br />Isabella Winslowe may be popular and sought after now, but she remembers how shyness and naivete kept her on the sidelines during her first season. Eager to help others like her, Isabella has created a Reading Society (referred to as the \\"Wallflowers\\" Society by some) in order to instill confidence in the quieter debutantes. But nothing prepares Isabella for the shock of finding one of the girls, Lady Gretchen Colebrooke, in her garden standing over the body of Boswell Throckmorten, one of London's most eligible rakes. To make matters worse, Gretchen confesses that during a secret assignation with Boswell, she struck him with a rock when they argued.<br /><br />Knowing a scandal will ruin not only Gretchen's reputation but her own as well, Isabella arranges for her aunt and the rest of the staff to go out for the day and quickly takes Gretchen home to her brother. Daniel, of course, does not believe a word of the outlandish story he hears and accuses Isabella of creating mischief. His opinion is only reinforced when they go back to the garden to find the body gone. Thoroughly disgruntled with each other, they swear never to cross paths again, but are reunited when they spot the supposedly dead Boswell walking about at a party they are both attending. When Gretchen disappears during the party, the pair find her once again standing over Boswell's body in their host's garden. This time, however, there is a letter opener stuck in his chest. When the body disappears -- yes, again -- Daniel and Isabella are thrust into a temporary partnership to uncover the truth.<br /><br />Appearing and disappearing bodies, an intrepid heroine and a noble hero -- this story had all the hallmarks of an exciting Regency romp. Unfortunately, the characters themselves prove to be the story's undoing. Isabella runs the gamut from poised and capable to giddy and insecure, while Daniel's constant declarations that Isabella is not the type of woman he is looking to marry -- even as he kisses her -- does not, in my opinion, make him heroic. While some of their encounters are diverting, both hero and heroine lack character development and never truly engage the reader. Meanwhile, a secondary plot involving another couple rings false, and in truth, is totally unnecessary.  Amelia Grey continues to show great promise with the intriguing twists and turns of her plots.

Already wearing her ball gown and with guests due to arrive at any moment, Lottie is determined to get a glimpse of him. After all, what better inspiration could there be for an ardent reader and would-be author of gothic novels than to look upon the man whose wife had mysteriously died just months after he had killed one of his best friends in a duel defending her honor. Going out on a limb (literally), Lottie sneaks into his backyard and soon finds herself in the arms of the man known far and wide as the \\"Murderous Marquess.\\"<br /><br />Hayden St. Clair, Marquess of Oakleigh, is a man accustomed to being alone. For four and a half years he's been the subject of rumors and gossip and, on his last night in London, the last thing Hayden wants is company, even if it comes in a beautiful package. At first he assumes Lottie is a courtesan sent by his friend Ned, and is even tempted to sample the goods. By the time the truth comes out, however, the alarm has been raised for the missing Lottie, and the pair must face even more scandal or marriage. Desperate to keep her beloved guardian from facing the marquess in a duel, Lottie convinces Hayden that marriage is their only option. The newly married but not at all blissful couple head off to Oakwylde, his estate in Cornwall, for a head-on collision with the ghosts of Hayden's past and his willful ten-year old daughter.<br /><br />ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL is everything a reader wants a historical romance to be. It's poignant and tender with sparks of passion and humor. First introduced in A KISS TO REMEMBER, Lottie is all grown up and fulfills the promise she showed as a child. Her joie de vivre is exactly what Hayden needs to bring him out of the darkness his guilt and sorrow have sunk him in. One can empathize with Lottie in her determination to reach out to her stepdaughter Allegra, and to end the years of sadness that have shrouded Oakwylde.

Through the years they've shared laughter and tears and the deepest secrets of their souls. One of those secrets is Bea's forbidden love for her stepfather, Philip Carmichael.<br /><br />Twenty years younger than his wife, Philip stayed devotedly by Evangeline Clouet's side even as she flagrantly took lovers and belittled his work at Meilleurs Amis, the exclusive chain of boutiques founded by Evangeline's mother. Now Eve is gone, murdered by a scorned lover, and the fashion world is waiting for Philip to stumble and fail. To complicate matters, something sensual and special is stirring to life between Philip and Bea. Knowing a relationship with his stepdaughter will lead to scandal and ruin, Philip tries his best to push Bea away, but they both know it is a losing battle. Is this the end of Meilleurs Amis?<br /><br />Meanwhile, eager to help her best friend save her business and start a new managerial career for herself, Lela hires on at the New York store as a salesgirl. Soon it is evident that the store is poorly run, and knowing she can do better, Lela strikes a bargain with millionaire entrepreneur Simon Graves. He's looking for a no-strings attached mistress, so she agrees -- if he'll give her a crash course in business management. It's the perfect arrangement until they fall in love, and Simon sets his eyes on the struggling Meilleurs Amis.<br /><br />PERSONAL ASSETS is a smart, sophisticated romance. The two relationships share equal billing and overlap to make a very modern tale. B&eacute;atrix and Lela are a far cry from the typical romance heroine. They are young, highly sexual creatures who try different things and are not afraid to go after what they want. Philip and Simon are transformed by their respective loves -- Philip dares to cross boundaries while Simon learns to express his emotions. Ms. Holly has skillfully turned the tables and woven a tale of two princes rescued from their towers by a pair of saucy minxes.<br /><br />Explicit in detail, PERSONAL ASSETS may not be your mother's fairy tale, but it will make you wish for a happily ever after of your own.<br /><br />TheSchemerwoven a tale of two princes rescued from their towers by a pair of saucy minxes. <br /> <br />Explicit in detail, PERSONAL ASSETS may not be your mother's fairy tale, but it will make you wish for a happily ever after of your own. <br /> <br />TheSchemer	2005-09-02

Born on opposite ends of the social ladder, servant boy John McKenna and earl's daughter Lady Aline Marsden are inseparable childhood companions. Inevitably, they grow into adolescence and their friendship blossoms into a forbidden passion. On the very night they finally give in to their feelings, however, the young lovers are caught and separated. Knowing her father's vindictive streak, Aline strikes a devil's bargain - a chance for a new life for McKenna far away in exchange for her public rejection. Not long after he leaves, Aline's life is forever altered in a terrible accident.<br /><br />Twelve years pass, and for Aline little has changed. Still beautiful and unmarried, she lives quietly at home with her brother Marcus, now the new earl, and younger sister Livia, herself the subject of recent scandal. Outwardly serene, Aline has never stopped grieving for her lost love. But a time of reckoning arrives, when her brother's latest business partners arrive from America, and a ghost from Aline's past reappears. One look in his eyes tells her his reason for coming, and Aline prepares herself for the storm to come. For the sooner he gets his pound of flesh, the sooner he will leave.<br /><br />John McKenna is back in England, and he wants revenge. A dozen years has seen his rise from bastard stable boy to one of New York's captains of industry, but he has never forgotten -- nor forgiven -- the woman who brutally rejected his love. Determined to seduce and abandon Aline once and for all, McKenna is confused by her calm resignation to his intentions. Soon his long suppressed feelings of tenderness resurface. But even as McKenna struggles to let go of the past and plan for a new future with Aline, secrets from her past may yet keep them apart.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an illicit romance begins between Livia and McKenna's partner, the troubled Gideon Shaw. A scandal for ending up pregnant (but losing the baby) after her fianc&eacute;'s death, Livia has shown no interest in other men. That changes when she meets the young, handsome New Yorker. In stark contrast to her sister, Livia dares to reach out for a second chance at happiness, but will Gideon be able to overcome his demons?<br /><br />AGAIN THE MAGIC is a shining example of Lisa Kleypas at the top of her game. Intense, affective, and heartwarming, the plot may be tried and true, but the telling of the tale is pure magic. McKenna is an unforgettable hero, angry and brooding but capable of such expressions of romanticism that could melt the most jaded of hearts. Aline, on the other hand, is more complex. At first, it's easy to think her reasons for continuing to reject a chance at happiness are silly and prideful, however, there is a particularly poignant moment with her brother that brings Aline's thought processes into perspective and gives fresh insight to her character.<br /><br />Powerful heroes and heroines, a fine cast of supporting characters, and moving dialogue all come together beautifully in Ms. Kleypas' valentine to her readers.<br /><br />TheSchemer, Livia has shown no interest in other men.

Although popular and successful in his profession, Jake has no ambitions other than a comfortable life while Lydia is the daughter of one of England's richest men and a brilliant mathematician in her own right. However, Jake's goal of hiding his feelings unwittingly results in destroying Lydia's blossoming infatuation and the pair's relationship evolving into one filled with tension. Now, Lydia has chosen to marry for practical purposes rather than love. When Lydia and Jake are accidentally locked in the wine cellar on the eve of her wedding to another man, long suppressed feelings come out, but is it too late?<br /><br />Ms. Kleypas pairs the charming Jake Linley (who first appeared in SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME) with the daughter of Sara and Derek Craven (DREAMING OF YOU), arguably her most unforgettable couple, and the result is a poignant romance peppered with humor and whimsy.

However, Kenna assumes it is Stryder she is exchanging letters with, and Simon says nothing to correct her.

Roxanne Ballinger left Oak Valley as a bright-eyed teenager eager to make her mark on the world. Make her mark she did, becoming one of the world's most recognizable models and a darling of the gossip columns. Now older and wiser (becoming tabloid fodder does that to a woman), Roxanne has come home to the valley to start a new life. After buying some property, she's eagerly working on renovating her new home. Life is almost perfect except for continuously running into her lifelong nemesis, Jeb Delaney.<br /><br />The Princess is back and Oak Valley detective Jeb Delaney isn't sure how he feels about it. Ever since the night he busted a seventeen-year old Roxy Ballinger for marijuana possession, the two of them have been sniping and snarling at each other every time she comes home for a visit. Now older and wiser (surviving two divorces does that to a man), Jeb is determined to stay away from Oak Valley's newest property owner. He figures she'll soon grow bored slumming and return to her jet set lifestyle.<br /><br />Just when these two think they've finally got a handle on each other, an unexpected moment alone explodes into a passionate tryst in Roxanne's kitchen, and both realize that all bets are off. Is it a temporary aberration or the result of years of denying a growing attraction? Roxanne and Jeb are about to find out.<br /><br />The second book in her Oak Valley series, Shirlee Busbee's COMING HOME is one of those easygoing, laid-back romances with just the right amount of sizzle to keep you hooked. While there is a bit of a mystery evident throughout the story, at its heart this tale is about two wary individuals who, having been burned by love before, embark on a relationship that has sprung up on them by surprise. Roxanne and Jeb are refreshingly mature and realistic. Ms. Busbee has wisely stayed away from emphasizing Roxanne's celebrity past, instead focusing on her readjustment to life in a small community and her cautiously evolving affair with Jeb. A well-detailed narrative brings Oak Valley and its inhabitants to life and adds to a sense of homecoming that will draw the reader in. Perhaps best known for her sweeping historical sagas, COMING HOME is a fine example of Ms. Busbee's versatility and is sure to introduce new fans to her body of work.<br /><br />TheSchemering affair with Jeb.

Sneaking off into the countryside to do some sketching, Charlotte witnesses a suspicious encounter between a stranger and another houseguest, James Morgan, the Duke of Girard.  Soon enough, Charlotte's world is spun out of control as she gets caught in a web of conspiracy involving stolen property and a plot to free Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba.<br /><br />James Morgan, the Duke of Girard, is out to find a thief within the government.  Believing his cousin Mortimer Blanton is the culprit, James becomes suspicious when a woman Mortimer is known to be courting witnesses a transaction between an agent and himself.  Needing a hiding place for items involving national security, James decides to place it in Charlotte's room, thus setting off a chain of events that lead to the pair getting caught in a compromising situation and temporarily betrothed.<br /><br />Sari Robins' debut novel is a tangled series of plots, subplots, and villains.  While heroine Charlotte Hastings is admirably self-sufficient and prone to laying her opponents low with groin injuries, she comes across looking more like Lara Croft than a Regency era lady.  Meanwhile, James Morgan may be a duke, but he certainly doesn't act like a gentleman.  It's hard to imagine a true nobleman acting the way he does towards Charlotte -- rudely tearing her artwork, dousing her twice with laudanum, and kidnapping her -- all before page 75!<br /><br />While the story fast-paced and enjoyable for the most part, one gets the sensation that the author, perhaps fearful of not having enough of a story to tell, proceeded to pile on the characters and subplots until HER SCANDALOUS INTENTIONS comes close to becoming a historical soap opera.

Simply stated, death will come to all who dare to take Penwyth and marry the maiden with the red hair and green eyes.  Since the death of her father four years ago, red-headed (and green-eyed) Merryn de Gay is the marriage prize sought by those who want the castle.  Four times married and widowed, Merryn has resigned herself to dying a much-wedded but never bedded maiden.<br /><br />When Sir Bishop of Lyte saves his daughter from a band of bandits, King Edward decides to award Bishop by giving him Lady Merryn de Gay in marriage and making Bishop the official heir to Penwyth Castle.  However, Bishop has no desire to be the next victim of the Penwyth Curse, be it manmade or not.  He decides that the only way to survive is to destroy the curse before he marries the Lady Merryn.  To discourage any who might wish to poison him, Bishop arrives at Penwyth declaring himself a wizard sent by the king to dismantle the curse.  When otherworldly things start to happen, Bishop begins to wonder if, perhaps, he might have some wizard powers after all.  Dragging a reluctant Merryn along, the pair leaves Penwyth to unlock the secrets of its curse.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in another time and not-too distant place, a wizard prince has come to claim Brecia, the witch of the sacred oak forest, as his mate.  Unfortunately, Brecia refuses to forgive him for setting her aside once before.  To make matters worse, a wizard rival named Mawdoor has set his sights on Brecia as well.  When Mawdoor traps the prince and Brecia in his tower, the pair decides to join forces to escape.  As their story unfolds, their actions will have consequences for future generations...<br /><br />Unlike the other books in this series, THE PENWYTH CURSE has a healthy dose of the paranormal with its parallel tales.

Still unwed after several years of being out in society, Harriet is feeling the pressure to either marry or return to country where the matrimonial prospects are dismal at best.  However, being neither an heiress nor a great beauty, she has long been overlooked by most of the ton's bachelors.  Given her desire for a true love match and the fact that time is running out, Harriet knows that it will take a miracle to find the right man.  A miracle that happens the night she claps eyes on the newly returned Steven Morris, the Earl of Heath.<br /><br />Steven Morris is in trouble.  Big trouble.  He's just found out that due to covering his mother's debts, he is now practically bankrupt.  The only way to save his patrimony is to marry an heiress.  Enlisting the help of his friend Royce, the pair decides to go on a \\"hunt\\" for a proper wife.  But having barely begun his mission, Steven finds himself attracted to the wrong woman.  There's something special about Harriet Nash but, alas, she doesn't have the kind of dowry that can save him from debtor's prison.  What this earl doesn't realize is that he's just met his match.<br /><br />In this spin-off to last year's A MERRY CHASE, Victoria Malvey brings back Laurel and Royce Van Cleef and pairs their best friends with each other.  Harriet and Steven's story is a classic tale of the battle of the sexes.  Taking a page from the original story, Steven has set up a wife hunt, but he doesn't count on Harriet taking the very same game plan and modifying it with a fiendishly feminine twist.  Add in her clever idea of joining forces with him, supposedly to rehabilitate his reputation and teach her how to flirt with men, and one can practically hear the rod reel this hero in.  Eating asparagus was never this much fun.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-09-01

He'd been second mate on the Paradisio, a sailing ship that disappeared when Hurricane Carlos hit the Caribbean. Although she hadn't spoken to or seen him in five years, Ava had always hoped to bridge their estrangement someday.  When a lawyer contacts her alleging the ship's owners were at fault for putting the lost crew at risk, Ava heads down to St. Barts to get answers from Marco's boss, Dane Erickson.<br /><br />To Dane Erickson Utopia Adventures was more than a business, it was his family.  However, even as he mourns the loss of the twenty-one crew members of the Paradisio, including his best friend Marco Santori, Dane knows many will look to blame him.  Knowing of Marco's split from his family, Dane wonders if Ava Santori's presence on St. Barts is motivated by a need to know the truth or greed.<br /><br />Wanting to discover the details of the new life her brother had created for himself, Ava accepts Dane's invitation to stay and explore Utopia's fleet.  Distrust soon turns to romance, but it soon becomes evident that something illegal is going on.  Will Dane and Ava uncover the truth before they become victims of foul play?<br /><br />Roxanne St. Claire's debut is a steamy mixture of intrigue, passion and red herrings.  Dane comes across as a hero too good to be true, but he certainly has the flair to carry it off.  Ava is the more complex character as she suffers from a combination of grief, guilt and a need for vengeance over Marco.

Elspeth goes to live with her godmother in London while Vance heads for Paris to become a soldier of fortune.  When Vance becomes a courier for the Marquise de Pompadour, the French king's mistress, he is accused of being a spy and imprisoned in a private chateau.<br /><br />Back in London, Elspeth has become the toast of the town and is very popular with all the gentlemen save for one, Gervaise Valerian.  Elspeth's two encounters with the dandy give her the impression he cares more for the cut of his coat than anything else.  When she receives word of Vance's capture from his best friend, Nicholas, Elspeth enlists his help to plan a rescue mission to France.  However, on the eve of their departure, Nicholas is attacked and injured and Elspeth is forced to proceed alone, only to cross paths with a certain hateful dandy.<br /><br />Gervaise Valerian has been living a lie for a long time.  A very public estrangement with his father is a ruse developed to protect Sir Simon Valerian from those who would arrest him for helping the Jacobites.  But it is no longer safe for Sir Simon to stay in England, and Gervaise is desperate to get him to France and on to safety.  Concocting an elaborate masquerade, Gervaise's plans almost unravel when his carriage collides with another and the woman he hired is injured.  Desperate for another to take her place, Gervaise turns to the other carriage and finds his nemesis, Elspeth Clayton, on board.

Returning a decade later to England, Gideon discovers his family has fallen on hard times.  His mother is dead, his younger brother Caleb is missing, and his sisters are living in poverty in London's slums.  Guilt-stricken at not returning sooner to prevent these tragedies, Gideon swears to find his brother and provide the very best life for his sisters.<br /><br />While following a lead on Caleb, Gideon discovers a scandalous secret about Gilbert Barham, the Marquess of Stanwell.  Seeking to buy his silence, the marquess makes an offer that Gilbert is hard-pressed to refuse -- his daughter Julia's hand in marriage and an entree to London society for Gideon and his sisters.  Knowing he is making a deal with the devil, Gideon agrees after remembering his vow to raise his family's station.  However, one of his conditions is that their courtship must appear to look like a love match.  The marquess agrees and says he will take care of the details.<br /><br />Lady Julia Barham is in the midst of her third season and is feeling the pressure to marry from her parents.  Unwilling to settle for less than love, Julia is also leery of leaving her younger siblings unprotected from the tyranny of their Aunt Aurelia, who acts as their governess.  Knowing her stubbornness, the marquess uses Julia's love of her younger siblings to force her into the betrothal.  He lies to Julia, telling her the only way to save the family from scandal and ruin is to pretend to fall in love with and marry Gideon Harwood.  But can a marriage built on lies and deception overcome the odds?<br /><br />The first in a new trilogy from Heather Cullman, SCANDAL is an engrossing tale.  In this union brought about by blackmail and trickery, Gideon and Julia are quick to jump to conclusions about each other which only lead to further misunderstandings.  However, that human fallacy only endears them to readers, who are hooked into reading further to see what will happen next.  The rest of the characters fit their typical roles -- the siblings (both his and hers) are adorable, her father is manipulative and scheming, and her aunt is the wicked witch out of a Grimm's fairy tale.

However, there's something different about the intense looks he gets from Diana Westover.  When he catches her several times eavesdropping on his conversations, Edmond decides to turn the tables and pursue her.  Soon their little rendezvous turn into stolen kisses, but there's a problem with their growing romance.  An old rival has long spread malicious lies about Edmond and it has tarnished his reputation.

It's hard to believe that a hero like Edmond Terrington would willingly stand by and allow himself to be slandered for years.  That behavior just doesn't seem...well, Regency-like.  As for Diana, as clever as she is to get into all sorts of adventures, her behavior comes across as erratic especially towards the end of the story.

By all accounts, Pip has grown up to be quite an accomplished and independent woman.  However, there remain traces of the spoilt girl who once drove her best friend away.  John Henry has grown up nicely as well, but his desire for Pip's unconditional love drives him to actions that might, in the end, prove disastrous.  Though you might want to knock this pair's heads together every so often, readers will enjoy this tale.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

Vere Aylwin Mallory, the seventh Duke of Ainswood, is a throwback to his family's wilder generations.  Having buried too many loved ones recently, he has sworn to care for no one else and proceeds to live a life of debauchery in London.  Of course, it would take a strong and unique heroine to tame him and Lydia Grenville is all that and more.  Lydia works as a reporter for The Argus, writing about the plight of the lower classes.  From the moment they meet, Lydia confuses, torments, aggravates, and generally drives Vere insane.<br /><br />I was so engrossed in their story that I was determined to stay up last night until I reached the end.  I got to bed after 2am but it was a night well spent.  This is a truly wonderful story of two obstinate people too blind and stubborn to realize that they are falling in love.  An extra bonus is that I got to catch up with characters from previous Loretta Chase books.  Sebastian and Jessica Ballinger from LORD OF SCOUNDRELS are here, as well as Jessie's dimwitted but lovable brother, Bertie Trent.<br /><br />Loretta Chase is a fantastic author who has always delivered the goods.  Once you meet Vere and Lydia you will want to enter Loretta's world.  A world filled with some of the most fascinating characters you'll ever meet between the pages of a book.  If you want to laugh and cry -- usually at the same time -- and see gorgeous men taken down a peg or two by impudent women with fiery tempers, don't miss THE LAST HELLION.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

All her life, Juliette had been known as the good girl, just as her twin sister, Gillian, was the wild child.  Doing what was expected of her, Juliette became engaged to her childhood friend thinking that years of caring would make a basis for marriage.  When her fianc&eacute;'s business partner was caught laundering mob money, she believed Stuart's denials of involvement.  However, when she catches him meeting with a reputed mob leader just minutes before the ceremony, Juliette realizes that she has been living a lie.

Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned and Doug's career is in trouble because of it.  His recently ended relationship had involved business and pleasure.  His girlfriend had access to information that proved useful to him in the past, but when he broke up with her, she gave him information on Juliette Stanton's fianc&eacute; which he inexplicably couldn't confirm once the story ran.  Hearing about the aborted wedding makes him think there must be a connection to his story, so now Doug has arranged to be at Secret Fantasy to fulfill the Runaway Bride's dreams while hoping to salvage his own.  Will they get both their fantasies fulfilled?<br /><br />Exotic and steamy, SECRET FANTASY was a joy to read.

Corrine writes historical fantasy romances featuring Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, and his family, while Celeste is the author of a futuristic/sci-fi series starring Jarred Varrain, an enforcement officer.  Mykhayl and Jarred have each gone on many dangerous adventures through the sisters' books.  What Corrine and Celeste don't know is that somehow, some way, what they've written has become reality in two alternate universes.  Worse yet, Jarred and Mykhayl know about them and plan to take their revenge.  In a bold move, Jarred and Mykhayl penetrate our dimension and kidnap the sisters (while they're in the middle of trying out lingerie, no less).  Now it's payback time for Corrine and Celeste as they each face a furious and handsome (not to mention well-endowed) warrior.<br /><br />In Diane Whiteside's BOUND BY THE DRAGON, Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, has brought back his tormentor for punishment.  Thanks to Corrine, Mykhayl has been imprisoned and tortured numerous times by his enemies.  Worst of all, she caused an ice serpent to bite him and render him sterile.  An intolerable situation for a king.  Mykhayl intends to make sure that this sorceress will no longer be able to make his life hell, even if he has to shackle her to his bed.<br /><br />Bewildered, bemused and definitely aroused (after all, she's very familiar with every inch of that physique) Corrine finds herself accused of being a sorceress and being eyed as a tasty snack both my Mykhayl and the imperial dragon, Khyber!  Wanting to make amends for all that she unknowingly put him through, Corrine is determined to cure his sterility and help him fight his enemies, even if it means being stuck in this universe forever.<br /><br />In Angela Knight's BOUND BY THE DREAM, Jarred Varrain finally has his chance to avenge himself on Celeste.  Because of her he'd been betrayed by the woman he loved, tortured by alien reptiles and, worst of all, had watched her plot his best friend's death but was powerless to stop it.  Yet for all she's put him through, Celeste has also been his obsession for years.  To ensure she will wreak no more havoc in his world, Jarred plans to give Celeste to his friend De'Lar as a new sexsub.  But first, Jarred is going to torture her slowly, exquisitely, on his specially made pleasure rack.  He was going to rid himself of his fixation once and for all.<br /><br />Once she realizes that everything she's written has truly come to pass, Celeste expects Jarred to kill her.  Instead, she's tortured with pleasure and Celeste slowly realizes a truth she's hidden for a long time.

She must marry, and marry well, to fill the family coffers with much needed coin and to provide her dowries for two sisters.  Sir Cyprian Avendall's offer of marriage seems like a dream come true to the sheltered girl.  Although she dislikes him on sight, as his wife she will live in a grand keep in Cornwall and always have enough to eat.  Best of all, her sisters will be safe.  When Avendall's men arrives to escort her to her bridegroom, she promises her sisters that she will ask Sir Cyprian to contract marriages for them.<br /><br />Morgan Chaltstrey, the Duke of Edgefield, has been waiting a long time to seek his revenge against Cyprian Avendall for his role in the death of Morgan's betrothed, Rebecca.  Now that Avendall has sought his own bride, Morgan's revenge will be to hold Gabriella hostage.  Morgan and his men easily defeat Avendall's men and take off with Gabriella and her chaperon, Dame Johanna.  What follows is a battle of the sexes as Gabriella fights to fulfill her duty knowing that her failure will be the downfall of her entire family, while Morgan struggles to remember Rebecca in the face of Gabriella's beauty and spirit.  Avendall is never far away, less concerned with his betrothed's well-being than her virtue.<br /><br />Lael St. James is a pseudonym for Linda Lael Miller, an author who is best known for her Sweetwater frontier historicals and Tremayne vampire series.  While MY LADY BELOVED was an enjoyable read, I could not bond with the main characters at all.  In the course of the story, it is clear that Gabriella is maturing as a woman, but her actions often make her appear childish and impetuous.  Politically incorrect as it sounds, I thought she might have benefited from a spanking or two from Morgan.  Of course, Gabriella's behavior colored my perception of Morgan as well.  It is difficult to imagine a battle-hardened knight, much less a duke, putting up with a young girl's antics.  The rest of the characters fulfill their roles admirably from the villainous Avendall to the compassionate Dame Johanna.  Gabriella's sisters, Meg and Elizabeth, also made quite an impression and I look forward to their stories.<br /><br />TheSchemerhe rest of the characters fulfill their roles admirably from the villainous Avendall to the compassionate Dame Johanna.

So long as a MacCairn lives, madness will be their destiny.<br /><br />In the year 1851 Ruairdh MacCairn is a man teetering on the edge of madness. The last of Aonghas' line, Ruairdh is determined that the curse will finally die out with him. However, as laird of his clan he must ensure their economic survival after he is taken by the Shadowing. Even if it means selling his family's castle.<br /><br />Anne Garthwicke and her father have come to Castle MacCairn to authenticate the keep and its contents. Shortly after her arrival, she finds herself clashing with the brooding laird by day even as her dreams are filled with passionate trysts with him by night. When tragedy strikes, Anne and Ruairdh are drawn closer together, but the Shadowing is waiting to claim the last of the MacCairns.<br /><br />THE SHADOWING is a gothic treat not to be missed! Classic elements of the genre are interwoven with a supernatural twist that will keep readers on their toes. The interaction between Ruairdh and Anne evolves from acrimonious to tender. Ruairdh is a haunted man who believes his soul is lost. His duty to his clan is the one thing that has kept him from succumbing to the family curse. Falling in love with Anne is a bittersweet reminder of what he can never have. His heroine, however, is no frail English flower. Anne comes across as a strong, resilient woman; she's had to be living with her embittered father. When Anne discovers Ruairdh's secret, she will stop at nothing to save the man she loves.<br /><br />Joan Overfield displays a masterful touch with this poignant tale.

They run the gamut from mystery to romance, from fantasy to adventure.  Even the lengths of the stories differ.  Some are only a few pages long, while others are novella length.  Never before have I read an anthology where each story was so different.  I literally didn't know what was coming next.  The theme that tied it all was the setting:  Regency England.<br /><br />There are stories that read like something out of an A&E production while others bring mythological creatures to life and land them smack in the middle of the English countryside.  Some tell of foul deeds and murder while others relate the everyday life of a country town.  Interesting characters fill the pages of this book including a courtesan in love, a bluestocking with a secret yen to dance and a very \\"devoted\\" butler whose story will leave you filling chilled.  Even Prinny himself makes an unforgettable appearance wearing a most unusual outfit.<br /><br />Being a romantic at heart, my favorites were romances.

Newly returned from exile in the Continent, Christian has come to England to destroy Denys Roth, the man responsible for his sister's suicide. To that end, Christian is attending a house party where he plans to seduce the woman Roth plans on marrying. However, instead of the worldly widow he had expected, Christian discovers Elise Middleton to be beautiful, virtuous and the stepmother of a little girl. Every stolen moment with her becomes heaven and hell for the haunted marquis. Somehow Elise becomes his hope of salvation even as he uses her to force a confrontation that will ruin any chance of happiness. When his machinations finally bring about a confrontation, Christian must look deep inside and make a final decision.<br /><br />Two authors, two stories, two totally different heroes. While all the elements for a great story were in place for Cathy Maxwell's novella, the main characters never fully grabbed this reader's attention. Both hero and heroine have been in love with other people for years yet their instant attraction to each other is supposed to excuse the rather fast shift in their affections. While most of the other characters appear one-dimensional and clich&eacute;d, the quaint English village does provide a cozy setting for all the plots being hatched. Perhaps if this had been a longer length story rather than a novella, Ms. Maxwell would have had a better chance at creating more sympathetic characters in this tepid tale. In direct contrast, Liz Carlyle's story of a marquis torn between finding salvation and delivering retribution is a poignant treat. Readers will empathize with this heroine torn between temptation and virtue and this hero struggling with demons from his past. Other guests at the house party provide interesting secondary stories.

Deciding that she would like to experience the joys of carnal pleasure without marrying, Anne hires Michael for one month.  Each enters into the agreement with ulterior motives and soon realize that they had gotten much more than they had bargained for.<br /><br />Robin Schone has written a book that is guaranteed to evoke strong emotions.  One can't help but feel empathy and admiration for Anne, a creature of her time who is bold enough to shake off the shackles of convention and reach for what she wants.  As for Michael, his story is heartbreaking and not easily forgotten.  Robin brings these two characters to life in a fashion that is vivid and poignant.  She pushes the story to its very limits then takes that final step over the line.  The result?  A story that leaves an indelible mark.

Unfortunately, there was a siege going on outside the walls of her keep. In a bold plan to save her people and secure her own freedom, Reyna disguised herself as a courtesan and set out to seduce and kill the leader of the invading army. Instead, Reyna is almost taken by Ian of Guilford, a notorious mercenary skilled in battle and even more skilled with women. Barely escaping with her virtue, she unwittingly gives Ian the knowledge to take the keep. Now Reyna finds herself a pawn with her very life in the balance.<br /><br />Was she a grieving widow or a cold-blooded murderer? Ian of Guilford is fascinated and most definitely attracted to the lady of Black Lyne Keep. Spirited yet haunted, the studious Reyna is unlike the ladies of the court that Ian had known before. When Ian is offered Black Lyne Keep and Reyna's hand in marriage, he leaves her little choice but to accept. Now he will stop at nothing to uncover all his bride's secrets.<br /><br />Madeline Hunter has won droves of accolades and fans with her distinctive stories. While LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS may not be as strong as her other work, it still provides an engrossing trip to a period in history when women were often caught in the middle of the politics of men. Ian and Reyna are made all the more interesting by their very human flaws and the twists and turns of the plot keep the action moving along at a brisk pace. The final verdict? If you've read the rest of Ms. Hunter's work, LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS is definitely worth reading. However, if this is your first Madeline Hunter book, be warned.

Nevermind that his grandfather also happens to be an English duke and Garrett is his heir. When he finds out that his sister Meg has left Boston to visit their grandfather, Garrett races to England to fetch her back to America at once. When he arrives he finds himself facing a rebellious sister, a tyrannical grandfather and the alluring widow charged with preparing Meg for the London season. When Meg informs him that she plans to attend the Season, Garrett decides to stay until he can change her mind. Perhaps, he'll use the time to get to know the lovely Lucinda better as well.<br /><br />Lucinda Devering was a woman on a mission. Struggling with her husband's debts and a lecherous brother-in-law, the Duke of Raynewood has promised to help if she prepares his granddaughter for her debut into Society. However, now that his erstwhile heir has arrived, the Duke wants her to turn Garrett into an English gentleman as well. Soon Lucinda has her hands full protecting Meg from her brother-in-law, keeping the peace between the Duke and his heir, and protecting her heart from this dashing captain.<br /><br />At its heart, Debra Mullins' first foray into the Regency era is a story of second chances. A NECESSARY HUSBAND is more than just a story between a man and a woman, although Lucinda and Garrett are worthy adversaries in the game of love. It's a story about a man coming to terms with his past and facing the possibilities of his future. It's also a story about a woman determined to restore the honor she feels she's lost due to a youthful folly. These insights into Garrett and Lucinda's personalities add depth to a well-crafted plot and make this typical Regency story anything but typical.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

She's a city girl who loves her decaf soy lattes and rescuing the occasional puppy or homeless saxophone player. When the love of her life leaves her with a broken heart, Jayne channels her grief into creating a self-help book. The result is Heartbreak 101: Getting Over the Good-Bye Guys, a runaway bestseller.<br /><br />Now researching her follow-up book, Jayne arrives in Arizona with five \\"breakup-ees\\" for a wilderness/open air therapy adventure. However, instead of the spa she expects, the wilderness lodge is really...a wilderness lodge with only one bathtub to be had in the entire place.

For Riley, there's always another assignment or adventure around the corner. Only once did Riley ever thought of settling down but a burst of panic made him sneak off into the night. When Riley decides to give his grandfather a hand by leading a group of women on a wilderness trek, he comes across his one true regret...Jayne Murphy. Can Riley make up for the hurt he's caused Jayne in the past? Can Riley survive five days of the Breakup-ees' anti-heartbreak workshop?<br /><br />At first glance, Lisa Plumley's RECONSIDERING RILEY comes across as an example of the \\"chick lit\\" trend.

Meanwhile, it's fun to watch commitment-shy Riley go down for the count.

Weary of lords pillaging her home and abusing her people, Talia has begun a course of action that will render her castle useless to the whims of men.  However, after yet another siege -- this one surprisingly bloodfree -- she finds herself the ward of Alexander de Monteneau.  Now, Talia must protect her secrets even as she fights her growing attraction to this new, very different guardian.<br /><br />For Alexander de Monteneau, Carrisford Castle is a temporary responsibility.

However, sparks soon begin to fly between Alex and his tempestuous charge, and he will have to choose between duty and love.<br /><br />Linda Needham has made a name for herself writing historical romances that leave readers cheering for the characters.

Mallory can write the love scenes, but it's all a product of her vivid imagination. She can't even talk to this irritating man without her palms growing clammy and her knees getting wobbly!

She's burnt her bridges by leaving the city and buying a farmhouse in rural Vermont. Okay, so the property was the scene of a grisly triple murder. A little notoriety just might help jump start her bed and breakfast inn! In the meantime, Sophie's got to keep an eye on her eccentric mother and rebellious teenage sister and her hands off the new neighbor who seems to be everywhere.

In other words, he's had everything handed to him on a silver platter. His one soft spot has been his childhood friend, lovely Emma Van Court. When Emma asks for his help in securing her guardians' permission to marry his cousin Stuart and move to an isolated island in Scotland where Stuart has accepted a curacy, James flies into a rage and reveals the pair's plans to their respective families. The pair responds by eloping and nothing else is heard of them for a year.<br /><br />When word comes that Stuart has died, James goes to Scotland to arrange for his remains to be returned to England. Assuming that Emma had returned to the bosom of her family, he is taken aback to find her still living on the island, working as a schoolteacher and acting highly secretive. To make matters worse, James finds out that Stuart was killed by an angry parishioner, and to make amends before he was hanged, the man left Emma his fortune. A fortune she can only inherit if and when she remarries. Now, James must uncover Emma's secrets even as he protects her from her motley assortment of suitors.<br /><br />All Emma Van Court wanted out of life was a husband and a family of her own. She thought all her dreams would come true when she married Stuart Chesterton. Now, Stuart is dead, she's hounded by the island's bachelors both young and old, and the Earl of Denham is back in her life asking all sorts of questions. Until the day she asked him for his help in marrying Stuart, James had been her hero. When his actions had led to her being cut off by her family, Emma had sworn never to forgive him. But now James is back, wanting to make amends and certainly acting differently. Emma is soon looking at James in a totally new light and when a debacle forces them into a marriage of convenience, James knows this is finally his chance to win the woman he's always wanted.<br /><br />Patricia Cabot's KISS THE BRIDE is a romantic confection filled with charm and humor.

Actually, she has two secrets. The first is that she is the infamous \\"Lady Scruples,\\" an avenging angel sworn to protect innocents against London's rakes and villains. Parris's other secret is one of long standing. Years before, under cover of darkness, she seduced Dominick Carlisle, only to have him turn around and ask for her sister's hand in marriage. Although the engagement eventually was broken, the heartbroken Parris severed all contact with Dominick and fled to London where she did her best to forget him. Now, a long awaited reckoning awaits her as she meets Dominick's eyes across a London ballroom.<br /><br />Dominick Carlisle, the new Duke of Wakefield, is a haunted man. All his life he loved and watched over his neighbor, Parris Sutherland. But he broke that trust one night when he allowed himself to be seduced by a mysterious woman. A monogrammed handkerchief found after the tryst led him to believe his mystery woman was Annabelle Sutherland, Parris's older sister. Honor-bound to propose marriage, Dominick broke the engagement after catching Annabelle with his own brother. However, it was too late to salvage his relationship with Parris, so he enlisted in the army. Eight years have passed and Dominick is back, determined to put things right with Parris.<br /><br />THE ART OF SEDUCTION is a steamy cauldron of plots, counterplots and misunderstandings galore. While the characters are sympathetic, there are times when they are filled with so much angst you just want to send them to therapy. With the majority of the story involving Parris trying to come to terms with Dominick's betrayal, some of her actions seem emotionally immature. Dominick's character, however, provides a nice counterbalance. Stubborn and not above using blackmail, he also shows a deeply romantic side by writing and saving eight years' worth of love letters that he never mailed.<br /><br />With its flawed but interesting characters, very hot love scenes, and an ending that will satisfy even the harshest critic, Melanie George's THE ART OF SEDUCTION almost, but not quite, hits all the marks.<br /><br />TheSchemers, and an ending that will satisfy even the harshest critic, Melanie George's THE ART OF SEDUCTION almost, but not quite, hits all the marks. <br /> <br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31
