She told me that I should give this a try since I love to read manga. Anyway, I bought the whole 28 books in Chinese and stayed up all night reading them..They are so hard to put down!! My husband came home from work only to find me still up and reading (I was reading when he left for work)! Imaging his horror! :O haha... <br /> <br />Yuri is a normal Japanese girl who suddenly got sucked into a puddle on the street and is brought to Anatolia in ancient Middle East.  <br /> <br />The artwork is beautiful and the storyline is wonderful. The whole manga is such a page turner!!! It make you want to know what's going to happen to Yuri and Prince Kail next. The English version is on #5 now, still a long way to go, but it is worth the wait!! :) I am collecting the English version as well (for myself and my husband who cannot read Chinese) I am hooked on Shinohara Chie's manga ever since I bought the Red River! It is a wonderful manga that will leave you wanting to read them again and again... <br />	2005-03-25

What a gripping read from start to finish! The story between Cat and Alasdair is truly beautiful and involving, and made the facts of an historical event a couple of hundred years ago come alive. I agreed with one viewer saying that this is a heavy historcal book...but the love story seems to fit into the book very well..when you read the book, you feel like you were there too... you feel their sorrow, joy, and anger...this is a book that will have you laughing out loud and crying your eyes out at the same time... all in all, this is a nice book for both romance novel readers and historical book readers...	2003-06-10
US	51033636	R3HN9FISITMLEX	0440235677	649928419	Kilgannon	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A nice surprise!	After I read the online reviews of this book \\"KilGannon\\" I ordered the books here on Amazon...It was a pleasent surprise for my part after I finshed reading these two books (KilGannon, and the wild rose of Kilgannon) The books are wonderful.. yes, some reviewers think these two books reminded them of the OUTLANDER series...I personally own these books, so I agree with them.  The KilGannon's story line is like this: Everyone expects Mary Lowell to marry the handsome Scotsman, Robert Campbell, whom she has known for years. Except there is a small problem: He hasn't proposed yet! Everyone else in the ton seems to be so sure that Mary is Robert's fiancee.  In the meantime, Mary becomes fascinated with and falls in love with another handsome Scotsman, Alex MacGannon-Laird of KilGannon. Mary is an Englishwoman who is expected to marry well and Alex is considered a 'barbarian' by members of the ton. And then there are the mysterious accidents that befall Alex that point to a relentless enemy. But then they got married and Mary is welcomed into the hearts of Alex's clan. But marriage doesn't mean living happily ever after for this couple because of the highland politics via love as Alex finds himself [drawn] into the plot to restore the Stuart throne.(the Jacobite uprisings)  It is refershing to see that not only Kathleen Givens manages to make her main characters lively, interesting and 3 dimensional, but that she also does this with the secondary characters as well.  All in all, this is an excellent read. If you are facinated by Scottish Romance novels, I high suggest you read The KilGannon and its' sequel. :)	2003-05-28
US	51033636	R1DUK0998GR2EA	0440235685	541962104	The Wild Rose of Kilgannon	Books	5	4	4	N	N	As good as KilGannon	The love story of Alex and Mary continues...Alex MacGannon prefers not to fight in the upcoming war between the English and his fellow Scotsmen. However, his friends, the MacKinnon and the MacDonald, persuaded Alex into join James Stewart's cause. Alex  leaves behind his beloved Mary Rose and his two sons from a previous marriage to fight for Scotland's freedom. However, Alex finds the Scottish leadership lacking in both courage and tactics. He stayed with his fellow Scotsmen even when James Stewart flees to France (Coward!!)and leave them to fret for themselves.  Alex refuses to go home in spite of missing his family and his home greatly. He wants to be sure that all his people return home safely and in doing so, he is forced to surrender to the English, who imprison him in the Tower. Though English, Mary risks her own safety by travelling to London to save the man she loves.  This is an amazing sequel of the KilGannon and Alex is an amazing hero, who understands loyalty as he insures his men safely return to their homes. And Mary, who gave up everything to go to Scotland with Alex, is more than willing to give up even more for her beloved's freedom. This is a must read for you Scottish Romance readers out there!! But as I finished the last page, it does make me wonder if there will be another book after The Wild Rose of KilGannon.....Wouldn't it be great?  ;)  I hope so...	2003-05-28

I have just recently bought a book called Fantasy Lover by Sherrilyn Kenyon...I haven't read it yet, so I dont know if its any good or not, but based on her story in this book, I thought to give her a chance, so we shall see...her story was a bit surprising because I dont usually read that kind of fantasy books.. Karen Marie Moning and Lynn Kurland's stories are wonderful as always, and Madeline Hunter's story isnt bad either, so all in all, this book is worth buying...	2003-04-08

Come and meet Carolyn and Lone Arrow..There are details about both cultures. They show different opinions about things, but they are drawn to one another.
