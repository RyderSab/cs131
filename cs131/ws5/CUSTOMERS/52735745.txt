You KNOW what I'm talking about. The diet isn't so much rigorous as it is regimented and you have to buy the doctor's supplements as well.

We also see glimpses of black market and yakuza life styles. The murders are creepy and disturbing, and the psycho-sexual world of tattoo customers is nicely underlined.

Mr. Twigg's Mistake is by Robert Lawson, the author of the Newbery award winning Rabbit Hill. This is a fantastic story, about a little boy in Connecticut who finds a tiny baby mole and feeds it from a box of breakfast cereal. This virtually non-nutritious cereal, hyped by its manufacturers in a most obnoxious manner, is described by Lawson in a way that will make even a jaded 21st Century consumer smile. Unbeknownst to everyone, the box of cereal fed to the mole is filled with pure Vitamin X. The Vitamin X should have been distributed in thousands of cereal boxes, but due to the mistake of Mr. Twigg, an employee at the cereal company, it all ends up in our hero's box.<br />What happens to the little mole as he eats the cereal, day after day, is the heart of this delightful story.  The artwork is as funny as this preposterous story. You'll enjoy it (although watch out for some of the dated nonsense that sometimes lurks when the black maid, Pearlacy, is present).<br />I believe this book is out of print, but if you can find it, it's a great tall tale to read with your kids!	2004-02-07

My two year  old loves this book. She's on a serious Winnie-the-Pooh kick, and try as I can to keep her on a \\"classic\\" Pooh track, with the original A.A. Milne stories and Ernest H. Shepard illustrations, the Disneyized post-1960 stuff keeps creeping in. This scratch and sniff book is pretty harmless Disney Pooh. The copyright date is 1974 - it was a \\"gently-used\\" gift from a family member with older kids. The artwork is closer to the time when the Disney Corporation actually cared about the integrity of the Pooh animation and illustrations. The story is cute and the scents fabulous, even though the book is nearly 30 years old! (Hint: We scratch around the edges of the fragrance label, where the scents are still very strong). The scratch and sniff labels include some unusual but very Hundred Acre Woods fragrances: clover, egg custard, pine tree, honeysuckle, gingerbread, and of course, Hunny! (Ahem. That's actually Honey!) See if you can get a gently used version, with fragrance labels still intact. This book is endearing and interactive!	2003-09-19

Yet I had similar experiences  - all the strange Caucasian expats, the horrible treatment of the African male students and workers by the French. Like Eden, I sometimes witnessed the French admiration for Black writers and artists coupled with their often patronising and condescending attitudes toward ordinary Black people. I thought Shay Youngblood captured rather well the gradual disillusionment with the romantic fantasy of a young American writer.	2003-05-22

This children's book has the coolest story and coolest illustrations - very late 1960s. Peggy thinks she is the most beautiful child on earth - just ask her! She's constantly trying to catch sight of her beautiful self - in mirrors, in puddles of water, in opera glasses. And do troubles befall her - all because of her vanity.<br />Peggy dresses beautifully, in outfits just like those designed by the real 1960s fashion designer Rudi Gernreich. In fact, Peggy looks like a miniature version of Gernreich's famous muse and model Peggy Moffitt. [No surprise when you learn du Bois was friends with Peggy and Rudi and Peggy's husband, the jazz photographer William Claxton]. For more on Rudi and Peggy, get the book Peggy wrote called The Rudi Gernreich Book.<br />William Pene du Bois is the Newberry Award winner of the Twenty One Balloons. He has a whacked and sly sense of humour, and his illustrations are so much fun. Don't miss his other children's books about balloons and diamonds and cuisine, teddy bears, lions, giants, detectives, etc. He also illustrated other people's children's books. Unfortunately, most of the books he wrote and/or illustrated are out of print. However, many are still available through used book searches. <br />Pretty Pretty Peggy Moffitt was one in a series of children's books du Bois wrote on the theme of the Seven Sins. I don't know that he ever completed the series, but if you can get your hands on Porko Von Popbutton (gluttony), Lazy Tommy Pumpkinhead (sloth)and Emile Bandicoot (greed, I think), you have quite the kid's collection on the Seven Sins.	2003-05-22

The training officers go through the motions of readying potential officers as fodder for the war effort. The training officers are quite a mix: some have enormous but fragile egos, wife and girlfriend problems, or are in denial about their distate for women but admiration for young men, flout the rules of command, or show great compassion. The young cadets are jokers, followers, outsiders; some are for the Fuehrer, others are wholly indifferent, and others actually dislike Hitler.  The constant jockeying for position has its fatal attractions; when a training officer is killed during an exercise, another young officer, Lieutenant Kraft, is given the thankless task of determining whether it was an accident or murder. His path of discovery and the decisions he makes expose the silence and complicity of even the \\"good\\" German officers in the horrific policies of the Fuehrer.	2003-05-22

I have been reading Anne Perry's books since college. I especially like her series with William Monk, Hester Latterly and Oliver Rathbone. I must say, however, that The Twisted Root needed to be more tightly edited. The ending of the book seemed very loosely pulled together; it probably needed at least two to three more pages of explication to round out the last of the twists and turns presented at the very end of the book.  Ms. Perry developed characters who seemed strangely isolated from the context of their work or lives. More questions than answers were raised for me. Didn't Sgt. Robb have any superiors to answer to on his first murder case, which just happened to involve a wealthy family? Why didn't we see Dr. Beck again after his assistance to Hester? Weren't any of the other nurses at the hospital worthy of Hester's attentions? I also thought some of her descriptions were redundant - of John Robb, Hester's  concerns about old, abandonned soldiers. Strangely, even for a Victorian couple, the warmth between the now-married-to-each-other Monk and Hester seemed more that of good friends than a couple in love. I do look forward to the next Monk/Latterly story, but with caution.	2001-01-03

I'm disappointed that this book does not describe in more depth Charles' role as a MODERN king-to-be. Britain was once one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen; in fact, most of its colonies have only been  relinquished post-World War II. Yet, there is no sense of Charles as a  truly modern man of the late 20th Century. He could be much more than a  mere figurehead for England, and yet he has chosen to do no more than his  mother does in terms of being a compass for England's winds of change.  Charles seems to have absolutely no political, social or economic advisers  surrounding him. Could this be because he is, as so many accounts have  suggested over the years, a rather dim bulb? After all, the Windsors have  never been known for being bright. Tellingly, Charles NEVER has any people  of color as friends, or in his entourage. No one from Hong Kong or China or  India or Kenya or Nigeria or Barbados or a couple dozen other former  colonies of color is ever seen anywhere near the Prince, whether as a  friend, confidant, or consultant. And yet there are hundreds of thousands  of well-educated men and women of color from the former colonies, who've  been educated at Oxbridge (Oxford and/or Cambridge) or the London School of  Economics or Britain's other elite learning institutions, who are of an age  with the Prince and could certainly fit into the Prince's circle. What an  example he could set for an England still going through the pains of  post-colonialism! But no. The King-to-be is as stuffy, conventional, and  ultimately, as out of touch with the new England as his mother and father.  This is the side of the Prince that warrants full examination . . . . . .	1999-09-16

About a tenth of the way into it, I found the writing to be uneven, the coincidences unbelievable, and my  natural desire to identify with and care about characters thwarted.  Rutherfurd's book alternately lectures on British history and provides  barely connected narrative from century to century (his chosen method of  exposition). Frustrated, I struggled to finish the damn book. After a man  at a movie theatre saw me carrying the book, told me of his similar  frustrations with it (and with Rutherfurd's Russka as well), and suggested  I simply abandon it on the nearest table, I took his advice, and did.

Does anyone remember just WHO  Mark Fuhrman is? He gained fame and notoriety as the Los Angeles detective  whose credibility was destroyed during the O.J. Simpson case. Why? Because  he lied on the witness stand, about a myriad of details relating to his  investigation of the case. Some of his lies related to his own admissions  and statements regarding his hate for Black and brown people. Was he not  charged with perjury stemming from his untrustworthy testimony at the  trial?

It is a beautifully  written, deliciously observed tale of the decline of a privileged upper  middle class Osaka family, told through the lives of four sisters.  I have  read this book three times and learn someting new each time.  It is a  thoroughly modern story with elusive and ghostly antecedents. Although the  tale takes place only 60 years ago, on the eve of pre-war Japan, it  describes a world now vanished. Tanizaki's writing is fluid and clear. His  description of Kyoto during cherry blossom viewing makes me sorry I've  never been there at that season. The sublety Tanizaki brings to the  emotions and motives of each of the persons attending  Yukiko's many miais  is amazing. Unfortunately, the film of about a decade or so ago doesn't do  the book justice. Thank you, Tanizaki-san, for giving us the Makioka  Sisters.	1998-08-26
