Welles Wilder revolutionized Technical analysis with his \\"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems,\\" investigating how oscillators work, and laying the foundation upon which many indicators have been built.  Welles wanted to do something about the fact that schools do not teach wealth acquisition.  He suggests that schools should offer a class called \\"Wealth Acquisition 101,\\" and went about writing \\"The Wisdom of the Ages in Acquiring Wealth,\\" to be used for the class.<br /><br />The same way that Welles took securities price prediction down to its basics.  He explores, how and why some people can accumulate wealth while others do not.  Mr. Wilder was concerned that both public and private Schools did not properly prepare students to acquire wealth.  To fill this void Wells researched, wrote, and published \\"The Wisdom of the Ages in Acquiring Wealth,\\" so that any student can master and learn the subtle untaught nuances of acquiring wealth.<br /><br />The Wisdom of the Ages, thoroughly, covers interest, real estate, and the stock market.  He covers the realm that normal people touch in their quest to accumulate a meaningful amount of assets.  The Wisdom of the Ages, serves as a foundation that will help anyone before they tumble into the path of wealth accumulation.<br /><br />No student of wealth's education can be called complete without a familiarity with the basic material covered here.  The secret's can be found in many places, it is very simple.  Here it is presented in easily digestible lessons.  Each chapter ends with questions that thoroughly cover the material in each chapter.  If you are in school and not self motivated you might need a teacher.  Anyone already out of school with some experience trying to amass assets, can use this easy to read and apply schoolbook, as a home study course.<br /><br />As with any class, all of the material may not be new to you.  What this instruction does ,like any school room class is, provides a comprehensive over view trying all things together in a package a student can hold in there mind as one unified concept.  The Wisdom of the Ages, will tie together all that you already know, and help you choose a path clear to where you want to go.ns that thoroughly cover the material in each chapter.

Jessie took many millions of dollars out of Wall Street but he played for the game.  He was up and down so often, and so high, that there was nothing left after the thrill was gone.<br />The antidotes on Jesse's life are very entertaining but not much use to refining a traders technique.  If he had died a few years sooner he would have been a hero.  As it is people confuse this personal life with that of a great trader who just got tired.<br />The included \\"Livermore Secret Market Key,\\" reprint contains a wealth of information  from Livermore's own hand.  If I did not already have it, Smitten's book might have been useful.<br />Cycles!<br />Jesse mentions market swings from 5 to 20 points that take from a week to a month.  It seems like Jesse is talking about what we now call cycles when he refers to the time element.  Trading into the future.<br />Trends!<br />He talks about this idea that the best trades are those that show a profit right from the start.  Therefore, by definition if a trade dips into a loss and violates your definition of what a trailing trend is, Speculators lose no sleep jettising it off right away.<br />Never permit speculative ventures to turn into investments.  Involuntary Investors ... make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all,  \\"they buy a stock that goes down, and they refuse to sell and take their loss.\\"<br />Trends work automatically, and consistently along certain lines.  If you recognize a trend and wait to get in at the precise time, drawdowns should be at a minimum.  The drawdown itself should flash a danger signal.<br />Pyramiding!<br />When your security is acting right you can safely add to your line from then forward.<br />One of the unique ideas that I may have overlooked in Reminiscences is that entering a trade a little late is a bit of added insurance.<br />There is a psychological value in drawing money out of your winnings.  Something I just love to do.<br />Pivot Point!<br />There is allot in here about his Pivotal Point entry.  However, unless you can get it out of the \\"Livermore Secret Market Key,\\" reprint contained in the book you will not find it in the \\"Smitten,\\" part.<br />Anyone can see where pivot points were, the psychological entry point can be determined when groups of other securities confirm the change in trend.<br />Double bottoms!<br />Jessie gets into what we now call a double bottom.  The first bottom is the primary pivotal point the second bottom (or top) is what he calls the \\"Continuation Pivotal Point.\\"<br />CPR's!<br />Jesse did early work on what we now call CPR's.  Closing Price Reversals.  CPR's often occur at the Pivotal Point.<br />He teaches us to only trade on pivot points.  But then goes on to explain the benefits of Box-break outs, trading on new highs and new lows.<br />Livermore's system of Sister Stocks is clearly explained and is a welcomed addition to Reminiscences.  I wonder why Smitten did not show these as a spread?<br />Money Management!<br />Your position is defined as the percentage of your portfolio you will invest in any single situation.<br />Find your Pivotal Points and trade in the direction of the momentum.  It is the big swing that makes the big money for you.<br />Jessie suggests averaging up, \\"within the pivot point range,\\" without defining what a \\"pivot point range,\\" is.  It may be the center reaction in the W of a double bottom.<br />The final time to pyramid is a break out (of the pivot point range?) on heavy volume.  It is riskier to enter a pyramiding action when the stock is far from the base.<br />My take on this is that Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lef&egrave;vre  is more helpful to a trader than \\"how to trade in Stocks.\\"<br />The bottom line on Livermore's money management still remains something I learned from Stanley Kroll.  To Quote Jessie Livermore in \\"How to Trade in Stocks.\\"<br />Shoot the Works!<br />\\"The only area I may have differed from most speculators, was when I felt I was truly right, dead right, for-damn-sure right-then I would go all the way, shoot the works.\\"area I may have differed from most speculators, was when I felt I was truly right, dead right, for-damn-sure right-then I would go all the way, shoot the works.\\"	2003-02-24

John Hill does a much more detailed chart reading. How much do you really want to know about Joe Ross?<br />A more descriptive name might be Ross's &quot;Tricks of a trader.&quot; Joe has many helpful tips about trading and technical analysis. Not a course in &quot;Trading for a business 101,&quot; but it is always refreshing to hear a trader ramble on about trading.<br />I like Joe's books. Ross's &quot;Trading Spreads and Seasonals,&quot; is at the top of almost 40 books in my Listmania &quot;Seasonal Spread Traders Library.&quot; Joe trades by legging into spreads.<br />Joes business book is as Kindergarten, where Tharp's is as a MBA. Ross's subtle references to business are unlikely to make a useful impression on a new technician. You must have a plan to become financially independent. Tharp's will help you develop a trading system and business plan at a fraction of the cost of Ross.<br />It must be said both authors depend upon the reader having previous experience with a consistently working entry technique.<br />Speculation is a business of managing profits. Without the readers experience with consistent profits, managing profits is just a fantasy.<br />Ross aims at small steady profits, Tharp teaches risk management.<br />The fundamental difference is that Ross admittedly a short term Trader in this book, advocates risking a full position when you first get in and holding a small position when the market runs. Walter Bressert advocates a similar technique.<br />Tharp suggests simply that if you had held your full initial position until final liquidation you would have had more profits in every case.<br />If you want a book about trading, technical analysis etc. Joes book is fine. If you are interested in learning the business side of &quot;Trading,&quot; I suggest Tharp's &quot;Trade your way to Financial Freedom,&quot; instead.reedom,&quot; instead.	2003-02-12

It does it great. Stochastics has proven predictive ability.<br />Wiest is incorrect about how Stochastics is used.  By themselves \\"low percentage numbers,\\" do not \\"foretell a rally,\\"  as Wiest Suggests.  In strong trending situations Stochastics can \\"hang around zero,\\" signifying weakness for a very long time.  Wiest is interpreting a Stochastic pop as foretelling a change in trend.  When it really implies a continuation in the current trend.<br />Stochastics percentage readings are used together with reading a chart to guestimate its strength relative to previous moves.<br />The most important Stochastic signal is divergence between Stochastics (%D) and the commodities price.  It is when Divergence occurs in an extreme area, and a cyclical bottom is due, that causes you to sell or buy against the major trend.<br />One way Stochastics might be used with scale trading.  If Wiest modified his system to temporarily use spreads (Bull or Bear) instead of being naked long on the way down.  A proper Stochastic divergence buy signal might be a trigger to place the proper scaling out sell orders for the shorts and the remaining net long positions.<br />Wiest's arbitrary placement of Stochastic stops in \\"You can't lose trading commodities,\\" is a personal problem of his that is not inherent or even suggested in the correct use of Stochastics.  I suggest reading Murphy or Lane for the correct use of Stochastics.  Murphy studied with George Lane and has a good grasp of explaining how Stochastics works in print.<br />The main concern I have with Wiest is if he can shamelessly mangle something I do know about (Stochastics), how can I fully trust is opinion on things that I know \\"I do not know?\\"<br />see, George C. Lane, \\"Lane Stochastics,\\" in Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities, May/June, 1984; see also, Murphy, John J., Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets, A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications, New York: New York Institute of Finance, A Prentice-Hall Company, 1986, p. 304-309.	2003-01-23

The Technique of Motor Racing<br />by Piero Taruffi<br /><br />Aloha,<br />  Thirty years ago I was a driver for the \\"Jim Russell International Racing Driving School\\" out at Willow Springs, CA USA.  One of the greatest times in my life.  Jim Russell (JRS) at that time had schools simultaneously on five continents.  We taught in so many languages that we did not have a textbook of our own.  JRS was busy training movie stars and World Champions for Formula One Race Car Driving.  JRS put students in single seaters from day one!  We use to order Taruffi's by the case.  It had been \\"The Book!\\" for over ten years and was very hard to find.  I think Harry Morrow would get them for us from England.  They would sell out every time.  We could not keep them on the shelf.<br /><br />  I use the principles I learned every time I take to the road.  I believe it has helped make me a safer and definitely faster better Motor Vehicle Driver.  Probably contributed to my long life, considering I am in the habit of winning on or off the track.<br /><br />  For decades I did not see Taruffi at all.  Sometimes I would pick them up in old bookstores.  I am glad for the sake of all future drivers that someone has had the wisdom to keep Taruffi in publication.  Just the fact that it is around after all these years should tell you something.<br /><br />  Even today, you will seldom see them sold used.  You will never see them sold cheap.  Many driving books are about the author.  Some are about street driving.  Taruffi is pure Racing!!  How you can drive a car faster.  The essence of driving.  I do not see how things could have changed enough to invalidate anything Taruffi has had to say.  Decide for yourself, you can always return it.<br /><br />  If you have read every book on Motor Racing ever published.  You will find The Technique of Motor Racing not only has a lot to offer you.  It may just be the most compact bit of Racing Knowledge you have ever found in one place.<br /><br />Pass Um`<br />-ooO-(GoldTrader)-Ooo-	2003-01-02

You have to find a way to keep your day-to-day needs for income separate from your program of wealth building.  You have to find a way to keep your spending from increasing just because you are making a bundle trading.  Seasonal Spreads are how many new traders build up a large trading account in a short time, starting with a hardly any capital in the commodities market.<br />In high school you should have become familiar with the \\"Ten Multiples.\\"  Let me refresh your memory.  Mony grows geometrically.  How much do you have when you double one thousand dollars ten times?<br />1. 2,000.00<br />2. 4,000.00<br />3. 8,000.00 etc.<br />If  you can save $20.00 a week and you will have  that first thousand dollars in less than a year.<br />Now the thing is this.

Stanley had quotes from Reminiscence all over the place.<br />  Stanley emphasized the lessons Livermore learned from Partridge in the 5th chapter of the book.  Here is where Kroll learned how to make consistent profits trading commodities.  It was Kroll's who resurrected the long out of print scrolls.<br />  In any case Jack Schwager did a Napoleon Hill of commodities traders.  Jack asked the traders.  The majority said \\"Reminiscences,\\" was influential in there trading.  It is no surprise that all the old timers claimed to read the same stuff!<br />  What I find about trading for a living is that there is really no one you can share your experience with without having him or her influence your trading.<br />  One thing is for sure, whoever wrote \\"Reminiscences,\\" knew an awful lot about the development of Jesse's trading philosophy.<br />  Reminiscences does not delve into chart reading or technical analyses.  It was before that.  Livermore's genius is that Reminiscences lives today eighty years later, as a \\"traders mind mirror.\\"  \\"Reminiscences,\\" echoes back your own thoughts reflected off of the mind of one of America's greatest securities traders.<br />  If you are new to the path or have lost your way, or just need a re-entry from a trading break.
