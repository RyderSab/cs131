US	53078187	RCD4WZYQGF3NA	0812509463	889610152	Wolf And Iron	Books	4	8	12	N	N	Take a journey into purgatory with an unusual friend.	I've read several of Dickson's novels, including the famous \\"Dorsai\\" books, but my favourite is \\"Wolf and Iron.\\" It loosely falls into the post-apocalypse genre but focuses on one man's struggle to survive in an era when everyone has turned on each other. Interestingly, Dickson has not relied on nuclear attack or disease to erase society but simple economic collapse, (to my mind, a much more likely cause).<br />Jeeris Belamy Walthar, or Jeebee, was a scientist researching quantitative sociodynamics. Despite foreseeing some sort of collapse, he finds himself less that perfectly prepared for the harsh new world born of riots, murder and isolationism. He is not one of the sort who takes to the times with such fervour; those who's morals are subservient to self-interest. Despite this, he pushes toward his brother's ranch, on the other side of the country. There, he hopes he might preserve his studies and thereby protect the future from continuing the otherwise inevitable cycle of growth and collapse.<br />There are many stories told of loners fighting against incredible odds. What makes this one special is Jeebee's tentative travelling companion, a semi-domesticated Wolf. The two of them are thrown together following a narrow escape from a town that looked too good to be true. Wolf chose Jeebee on the tenuous basis of his smell, a result of his wearing a scavenged leather jacket, previously owned by Wolf's dead owner. Over time they managed to form a supportive arrangement that benefits them both. However, this relationship in no way resembles pet and owner.<br />I particularly enjoyed the way Dickson researched wolf behaviour and how that behaviour translates in combination with humanity. Wolf turns out to be just as important a character as Jeebee and because of that, the novel is almost a buddy story. Perhaps being a science fiction author has inclined Dickson to treat Wolf as a fully-fledged entity, much like one might approach an intelligent Alien race. Wolf may think differently but he has the same rights we are due and is just as worthy of respect. This is not a Disney story but many readers will see the folly of placing humanity on a pedestal above the Animals. No matter what we like to think, we are not so different.ink differently but he has the same rights we are due and is just as worthy of respect.

Originally published in 1988 it took twelve more years for a commercial following to gather for the Liaden Universe. The first three books, \\"Conflict of Honors\\", \\"Agent of Change\\" and \\"Carpe Diem,\\" were then compiled into a single volume and sold as \\"Partners in Necessity.\\" During the mild aftermath of their first being published, Sharon Lee and Steve Miller continued to write, but mostly for themselves. If the general public didn't embrace what they wrote, at least they enjoyed writing it.<br />The strange thing here, is that those three novels were excellent. It's a mystery to me why it took so long for them to succeed, as they should have from the first day. The book market can be an unpredictable battleground. If it weren't for all the positive ratings awarded on Amazon.com, even I would not have read these quality novels.<br />Written in the vein of space opera, each of the Liaden Universe books, six so far, centre on the Liaden clan Korval. A non terrestrial but human family that ensures its survival in a universe of cut-throat politics with commercial acumen, a fleet of ships and a generations long breeding program aimed at producing pilots, (a rare bread of individual that has the reflexes of a cat and the courage to match). Each book tends to concentrate on one couple, typically as they meet, fall in love and life-bond. All this tends to happen under adverse circumstances; running from secret government agents, duelling with mad ship captains, targeted by a futuristic crime family or just being attacked by a mindless race of aggressive aliens known as the Yxtrang.<br />The Clan Korval is not always fighting alone however. One of their more fascinating allies is the Clutch Turtles, linked to Korval through an unspecified and mysterious adoption. These aliens are an old race, long lived, slow to act, fascinated by art and possibly the most deadly creatures in known space. There are so many factions, families, races and species involved in the Liaden universe that we need every book these talented authors can produce just to scratch the surface. I just hope their growing popularity gives them enough reasons to continue writing.that we need every book these talented authors can produce just to scratch the surface.

How would you feel if you were suddenly asked to live someone else's life? A life where you are being saught by the police, organised crime and an unwanted prospective bride. In The Gandalara Cycle novels, the old and dying Ricardo Carillo find's himself in the body of a young man, in an unfamiliar world, with a large lump on his head and a freakishly large cat stalking him.<br />There are seven books in this series and each of them is a good read. I particularly like the first novel because Ricardo is seeing everything with fresh eyes. His  unique way of dealing with things prompts some interesting reactions from all those who think they know him. In a sense, many believe the problems of others are minor in comparison with their own. This story allows us to explore that theory. Can a complete stranger untangle a young man's life?<br />All seven novels are tied to a logical plot-line but this structure is only revealed a piece at a time. In this way the narrative is full of enough suspense and action to encourage some very quick reading. There is enough misdirection that we have to turn our personal theories upside-down, several times. This is good value, because each time that happens, you are forced to review everything that has already happened in the new light of new understanding.<br />The society depicted is not overly different to reality, although the inclusion of a small minority, who posess extrasensory gifts, is pivotal. This concept has been well explored elsewhere but the author uses the subtle variations well, drawing the possibilities into new and interesting directions, both political and metaphysical. These books should interest those who enjoy traditional science fiction as well as the fantasy buffs. Although often out of print, I recommend you try to find secondhand copies somewhere.	2002-10-11

So there is that much more reason to celebrate good comedy novels. Douglas Adams' \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" series started out as a radio serial, then went to book and was finally made into a television series. I even hear it may see the big screen soon. For me, the best format so far is the novels.<br />Adams writes well, has a fertile and sometimes bizarre imagination, peoples his stories with self-absorbed characters and isn't afraid to make the central hero a  pessimistic boor. There has been science fiction comedy before this but Adams has earned the crown for the best Sci-Fi satirist, in my opinion at least.<br />This five-book trilogy revolves around Arthur Dent, supposedly a typical English loser. Poor Arthur gets thrown into one difficult situation after another, not because he is in any way special, but because his best friend, Ford Prefect, happens to be an alien reporter for the most popular book in the history of the universe, \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Ford saves Arthur from Earth's immanent destruction, thus derailing Arthur's equilibrium. He doesn't regain his balance until four books later when he falls in love.<br />Adams is the modern day Oscar Wilde or P. G. Woodhouse. His dialogue is so witty and surprising, that when I first read these books it was impossible to hold in my laughter. And it's not just the occasional quip, sprinkled into an otherwise standard tale; the whole thing tends to build into a crescendo that is almost too funny to bear. I've read this series so many times I've almost memorised each word. Don't miss out on some of the funniest writing to be seen in the last 50 years.	2002-05-26

It is light and yet absorbing, fast paced and yet it gets to the root of your emotions.<br />We are introduced to the main character, Davy Rice, as a young boy, escaping an abusive father. This is where the story starts because it is also the first time he experiences a Jump. Not that he believes it at first but this young lad has the ability to teleport.<br />OK, I know what you are thinking.  That this is a tired old theme, already used to death in Sci Fi. Well you are wrong. Steven Gould, has taken a refreshing look at this subject and deals with it in a realistic way. Davy, as a character, is very easy to understand and empathize with and for this reason we truly believe what is happening to him.<br />Before he can safely live a life away from his Father, Davy must get some cash, establish an identity, rent an apartment and all the things which you and I take for granted. This is made fascinating because he is a minor and has that special skill that no one is aware of. To complicate his life, Davy starts to fall for an older woman. A college girl who Davy impresses with his knowledge of the city and obvious wealth. Add to this the fact that his long lost Mother reenters the picture and Davy has a pretty full life.<br />This is just where the adventure begins. His mother becomes embroiled in a plane highjacking but Davy's efforts to involve himself are threatened by a police officer who is curious about his wealthy life style and questionable ID. The pace moves up to a higher level as Davy falls into international intrigue and ruthless terrorism.<br />This novel is a terrific first outing from Gould and I would recommend it to anyone who still has a little adventure left in their soul.	2002-01-30

For me, his writing is engaging at many levels. As works of pure adventure, they're good but as philosophical explorations of a horrible future, they're great. Some will find his work a little preachy and some will find it juvenile. I am lucky enough to sit in between these two categories and just find these books on my bedside table again and again.<br />There are currently four books in the series, \\"A Matter for Men,\\" \\"A Day for Damnation,\\" \\"A Rage for Revenge\\" and \\"A Season for Slaughter.\\" I understand three more books are planned, \\"A Method for Madness,\\" \\"A Time for Treason\\" and \\"A Case for Courage\\" but it's been so long I have given up hope of seeing them. The original four are hard enough to find as it is.<br />The series describes an alien invasion that was totally original for it's day and even now has not been bested in the creative stakes. Imagine an alien biosphere that is seeding the Earth with selected ecosystems, evolved in much more competitive evolutionary circumstances that can be found locally. Each organism is both capable of out competing its local variants  as well as paving the way for more complex life forms, higher up the evolutionary pyramid. Viruses, super algae, motile plants and omnivorous gastropods are just some of the amazing variety of specimens that are wiping out the Earth's native ecology with frightening rapidity.<br />All of this is explored through the eyes and ears of a young American, James McCarthy. He survives the plague years only to emerge into a devastated society that is barely away it is now at war with an alien threat. Through bad luck and bad planning James is quickly submerged directly in the fight and quickly becomes an expert on \\"worms\\" simply because he manages to keep surviving contact. Intermixed with desperate fights, we are introduced to the world political scene that is hampering humanity's slim chance for continued existence. Jim is drawn into a secret organisation whose sole aim is killing the alien menace, at whatever cost. The methods they employ are drastic and shocking but hard to argue with as Jim quickly learns after seeing a little girl executed rather than go on living in a worm's larder.<br />These are challenging books that are not for everyone.

Reading more like fantasy, these books had such a richness of detail and so many impossible ideas, that you are almost forced to take notes just to keep up with the narrative. But despite such complexity, the books are gripping and easy to read. This is greatly helped by there being, almost exclusively, one point of view.<br />Severian is the central character in the story. A young boy, perhaps orphaned, entering into the little known torturer's guild in the far, far distant future.  We don't know the year but we do know the sun is in decline and a religion has sprung up surrounding the myth of the coming of the new sun. Severian knows nothing of the world, at least in the beginning, but it is that very innocence that helps introduce the wonders of his world to us. As he is forced into the broader landscape, we, the readers, are dragged along with him, learning of giants, green men, aliens, rebels and the mysterious Claw of the Conciliator.<br />These books are definitely going to be read and re-read by fiction lovers. They are classics and as such, only get better with time. If you enjoyed Robert Silverberg's &quot;Majipoor&quot; novels or Jack Vance's &quot;The Dyng Earth&quot; series, then you will not want to miss the four novels in &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; series, recently republished in two doubled volumes.	2001-12-23

Michael Whelan, the illustrator, sure earns his fees. But once I got into the book, I could barely stop. Set in a country that is a smooth blend of Japan and China, Russell invites us into the lives of several extremely interesting characters.<br />Probably the most central character is the Lord Shonto. Most people we meet along the way, are either his confederates or his enemies.  The title character however, is the one who draws us more deeply into the story. Brother Shuyun is fresh out of the temple and has been selected to serve the Lord Shonto in place of his previous Botahist Monk. This humble, quite and mysterious monk is not only adept at the arts taught in the temple but is deemed by his teachers to have a special purpose. The suspense is delightful as Shuyun slowly comes into his own under the moral guidance of the great lord and his talented and beautiful daughter.<br />This is a book of details and yet it doesn't get bogged down by them. I love reading about the intricacies of a board game called &quot;Gii&quot;, obviously styled on &quot;Go.&quot; The court politics, philosophy of gardens, strategies of war and teachings of the Botohara are all captivating. Even the bad guys are fleshed out sympathetically. This book, along with its sequel &quot;Gatherer of Clouds,&quot; is a masterwork and is bound to stand up over time as a fantasy classic.	2001-11-09

I became interested in it after researching John Quincy Adams. The film &quot;Amistad&quot; started me down this path and eventually led to JFK's Pulitzer Prize winning book. It was written while he was still a Senator and focuses, for the most part, on historic politicians. Kennedy obviously admired these men, not for their great successes but for the personal price they all paid as a result of choosing to do what they felt was right.<br />Each man gets at most a chapter, and so Kennedy limited himself to one or two important events in their political careers, often their last  stand. Not only are these men admirable but they are also very real. He manages to show us the human, less than perfect, side of each while convincing us of their moral strength. Each chapter leaves you wanting to know more about these men, who helped to shape American history.<br />The nice part about the book, and probably the key reason it won a Pulitzer, is that each event reads like a thriller. These are interesting stories and because Kennedy wrote them in chronological order with a few historic segues, the whole thing holds together to give us a better feel for the sweep of history. We willingly learn about the underlying currents that can inexorably drive a country in a certain direction.<br />&quot;Profiles in Courage,&quot; is an easy read that teaches as it entertains. Kennedy seems to be encouraging us to look back at a past where &quot;politician&quot; was not a dirty word and in so doing, we are left with the suspicion that Kennedy himself, was trying to live up to those outmoded ideals. Knowing his fate, every word seems to have a poignant aura that makes it all the more memorable.	2001-10-19

I'm not averse to good military fiction, and the Time Raider books are defiantly in this category, but when a time traveling, spiritual element are added, you get magic. What if reincarnation was real but instead of moving forward, as you progressed toward enlightenment, you had to go back through your past lives on a near impossible mission to redeem your soul.<br />Dan Samson is a 20th century man who has finally passed a moral threshold, earning the right to make just such a backward journey. He dies and wakes as a  past version of himself, usually selfish, petty and often evil. In every case Dan seems to arrive just in time to realize what crap his past incarnation has dug himself into but also in time to have a slim chance of turning things around. The other common thread is that he always seems to die in battle. Fate plays a big part in his career choices, friends and particularly, his enemies. You see, Dan is not the only one with past lives.<br />John Barnes' writing is tight and riveting but it's the ideas that make his books special. Each of us struggles with inner demons but nothing like Dan's. He is a good man who must constantly work to convert garbage into gladiolas despite the hatred and entrenched expectations of everyone around him. I have often wanted to go back and do things differently, through Time Raider we get to share in the ultimate extension of that desire.	2001-09-03

I'm talking laugh out loud funny. They are also quite addictive and it is difficult not to read each in one sitting. Fair warning though, I'm fairly sure &quot;Phule's Company&quot; and &quot;Phule's Paradice&quot; are the only two novels in the series that were written by Asprin, so buyer beware for the rest.<br />The basic concept revolves around one key individual. A career military commander who has the happy knack of getting the most out of his people and achieving even seemingly  impossible goals. The trouble is, this paragon of virtue is also a rich playboy who is an officer in the Space Legion; a branch of service despised by all the others. He also enjoys the active animosity of some very high ranking brass, who like nothing better than to set him up for failure.<br />It is just such an attempt that puts Captain Phule in charge of the Omega company; a band of ruthless, capitalistic, incompetent, belligerent misfits who's sole purpose seems to be to make the rest of the legion look a little better by comparison. Half the fun of these novels is watching this group of interesting characters turn their unique talents for mayhem to good ends, or at least Phule's ends. I don't promise you Shakespeare but you will get a kick out of Phule's Company.	2001-09-03

Some of them have left me feeling very disappointed, but not Dune. It is a powerful novel that can stand alone comfortably, despite the sequels. In fact, the sequels are not in the same class; worth a read but not equal to his masterwork.<br />Like some of the best books, you get a strong sense of history in Dune. We may be reading about a small part of one man's life but in it, we glimpse the sweep of time. Political  machinations, that have been brewing for hundreds of years, are laid bare. We see secret organisations that have been working toward their lofty goals for millennia. And, family credos that have been refined over many generations. Paul Attreides is the product of all that and more.<br />Dune is not a light book. You won't read it in an afternoon. But when it is finished, you will not be able to forget it. The characters you have read about, will become permanent fixtures in your mind. Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck and all the rest, will be the yardsticks by which you judge similar people in the future. The fact that they populate incredible worlds and live with creatures more strange than any out of legend, only makes the reading more enjoyable. If you don't have a copy of Dune in your collection, then you don't know science fiction.	2001-04-01

The novel I like best so far is his alternate history story, &quot;1632&quot;, the title relating to a year, of course. It may not be as complex as a Turtledove novel but it hit it's mark with a great deal of force none the less.<br />Alternate history ideas can be as subtle as one man making a different decision, sometime in the past. &quot;1632&quot; is a little more dramatic. An entire mining town in West Virginia is sucked back in time and dropped in Northern Germany during a time of war, disease and starvation. There are similarities between this book and the Natucket series written by S M Stirling but &quot;1632&quot; is more in the adventure mold.<br />The narrative tends to focus on Mike Stearns, the mine's union leader, who seems to have more of what their new situation needs than most. He reluctantly takes the reigns of a red-neck train that's on a  collision course with the Holy Catholic Spanish Army, amongst other. But the town has to take a few steps back in time themselves, before they find a sustainable level of technology. In the mean time, some of their tricks are leaking to the enemy. Their survival hinges on making friends and allies as fast as possible.<br />There is a strong theme of American pride in this book. I'm not American so it might have been irritating. In the end though, it comes across more as pride in modern man's culture, its achievements and the fibre of its people. Flint takes a long look at the moral differences that 450 years have made, just as much as he covers the technology gap. The locals take one look at these Americans, their confidence and their sense of freedom, and assume they are all aristocrats. For only princes could live a life without fear. It is this human element, that makes the novel so good. I was bitterly sorry to see it end and can only hope Eric decides to continue his extrapolation of a time that never was.olation of a time that never was.	2001-03-10

Take a look at that cover art, not very inspirational. But it is written by Longyear and his work is usually good. It's not that this book is full of adventure or has a rich plot line. It doesn't even have exotic locations or lots of sex. What it  does have, in truck loads, is empathy for the human condition. The main  character is Jacob Randecker. He is a thinly veiled version of the author  himself. They say that autobiographies are usually crap but then they also  say write what you know. Whatever the case this book is undeniably  excellent.<br /><br />Jacob is an addict. He is addicted to alcohol and  prescription medications. But then that's the most common kind. He doesn't  think that he needs help but his wife and his friends, (the ones he has  left), are adamant that he does. They use all of the pressure that they  can, to get him to go to a rehab center called Saint Mary's. This is an  actual hospital in the U.S.<br /><br />The novel takes us through the program  with Jacob and his group. We come to love Jake and each of his group. We  also fall for the members of the hospital staff that we meet. It is that  sort of book. I hope writing this book was cathartic for Longyear because  reading it sure was for me.<br /><br />I want to leave you with a small  section from the dust jacket that I think may have helped my decision to  read this book:<br /> - One third will make it the first time around.<br /> -  One third will have to try again.<br /> - One third are already dead. It just  takes them a while to lie down.	2000-06-22

Even so I think you will find the Forever Hero series of books very absorbing. Modesitt has written quite a lot of good novels and series, so it was no  surprise for me to find this  gem among his other pearls.<br /><br />The story  concerns the interaction between a galaxy spanning human empire and a  savage, born on post apocalyptic Earth. As it turns out this young man does  not age, at all. He also has a burning desire to see the mother of the  human race, Earth, be renewed after its centuries of environmental  devastation. In order to achieve this he has to overcome a universal apathy  and direct opposition. To spice up the story our hero has almost super  human reflexes and a natural inclination to use deadly weapons.

From  that moment on he is no longer a soldier.<br /><br />Luckily a rather mystic  figure called Pen, takes him under wing, trains him in the martial arts of  the ninety nine steps and then releases Emile to fulfill his destiny. Along  the way he single handedly starts, maintains and ends a guerrilla war  against the government and then assembles and trains a team which forces  the whole system to its knees.<br /><br />Perry is definitely a commercial  author but I doubt he would apologize for that. The Matadora series is a  good example of this. It panders to my every boyish reading desire and I  thank Perry for it.	2000-05-17

Feist originally wrote one large volume called &quot;Magician&quot; to kick off what turned into a major series. In 1998 this extremely large novel was broken into two, edited by the Author and published at &quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Magician: Master&quot;. In the process, extra material was added, filling in some of the gaps and fleshing out a few characters more fully.<br />In retrospect it seems like the original book was begging for a split. Almost exactly half way through, there was a major change in direction.  The focus moved from one world to another along with the central character, Pug. Naturally, the Apprentice and Master mentioned in the book's titles refer to Pug's stages in his training as a magician.<br />I was not completely happy with the remaining books in the series, however, the two Magician novels are perfect and also work well without ever reading the proceeding books. The characters are real, rich and engrossing. The plot is complex but focused. The environment, is carefully crafted, particularly the political landscape.<br />At the risk of becoming hackneyed, you will have difficulty putting these books down. The underlying level of suspense is intense which in itself is the sign of a good writer but even more, you will begin to care deeply for Pug and a need will grow to find out how everything turns out.	2000-05-17

Some is more serious, like \\"The Damned\\" books but I like his humor the best. And of his lighter writing, my hands down favorite is Jed the Dead.<br /><br />It's quirky, full of pathos and has a straight man to beat them all. Even the basic idea is funny; a good ol' boy called Ross, taking a driving holiday, stumbles on the body of a dead alien. Rather than bringing in Mulder and Skully, Ross decides the alien corpse might like to see the west coast as much he does. Thus starts the mother of all driving holidays, buddy stories and fugitive chases.<br /><br />You see, Ross is a laid back kind of guy and thinks nothing of having a bit of fun with an alien body. And of course, nobody would suspect the truth, not with the alien blatently riding shotgun in Ross's convertable. But the happy times can't last forever, and when Ross starts showing smarts he wasn't born with, we start to suspect Jed may not be quite as dead as we thought.<br /><br />The fed's are hot on the trail, a bunch of loony UFO freaks jump on the bandwaggon, hollywood takes an interest and in his spare time Ross find a shapely friend to share his ride. All of this is well within the capabilities of your average boot wearing Texan but when extraterestrial police start making a fuss, things leave the relms of even Ross's ability. This book is laugh out loud funny so don't read it in public places but do read it. You'll thank me.	2000-05-17

It consists of five novels, &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Queen of Sorcery&quot;, &quot;Magician's Gambit&quot;, &quot;Castle  of Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Enchanter's End Game&quot;.<br /><br /> A classic  rags to riches story, (actually a farm kitchen hand to King story), it also  has the fate of the world hanging in the balance. The chief bad guy is no  mere murderer. Nothing less than a mad God will do as a suitable challenge  for our hero, Belgarian.<br /><br /> Why is that, I hear you ask. Because as it  happens, he has the potential to become a powerful sorcerer. But only with  the help of his five thousand year old &quot;Grandfather&quot;, Belgarath  and his slightly younger &quot;Aunt&quot;, Pol.<br /><br />  Each of the five  novels takes us through a semi-distinct stage as Belgarion assembles his  team, (just as the prophecies foretold), and does battle with the forces of  evil. The whole of the series is great fun to read. It is very easy to  empathize with young Belgarion and the variety that Eddings has placed into  his world is astonishing.<br /><br /> The actual sorcery in the story is well  thought out and almost believable in its consistency. There are also some  interesting theological issues tackled. Overall it stands out from similar  styled fantasy efforts because it is well written and is not afraid of its  grandiose scope.<br /><br /> Eddings has since been followed up the series with  the sequel series, &quot;The Malorian&quot; and at least one prequel novel,  &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot;.	2000-05-03

Since my reading tastes differ quite markedly from my Mother, (Mills and Boon), I fully expected to throw  the book away after the first few chapters. What actually happened was I  could not stop reading it. In the end I finished it at about 5am the next  morning after going without sleep. It is terrific.<br /><br />The story is  set in South Africa as we follow the life of a small English boy by the  name of Peekay. As his Mother suffered a breakdown following the death of  her husband, Peekay was raised mostly by his native nanny. As a result he  eventually learned to speek English, Afrikaans, and Zulu.<br /><br />At about  the age of four he is shipped off to boarding school, where he is not only  the youngest boy there but also the only Englishman amongst the Afrikaners.  He therefore is subject to much bullying with only his pet Chook at his  side for support. Despite a bed wetting problem, which is later solved by a  great Zulu medicine man, he makes it through his time at school until his  mother moves towns and calls him back to join her.<br /><br />On his train  journey to get there, Peekay meets a man who will become a major influence  in his life. He is a fairly successful boxer who gives Peekay a methodology  for dealing with life. &quot;First with the head then with the heart&quot;,  he says. Further more, he fires the small boys imagination and Peekay finds  his purpose in life, to be a world champion boxer.<br /><br />On his arrival  into his Mother's town he finds the second major influence in his life,  Professor Von Vollensteen, or Doc. Peekay is almost adopted by Doc who acts  as a respite from his now born again mother and also teaches Peekay Music,  Botany and a love of nature. When world war two starts the Doc is taken to  prison as a German and as a result Peekay follows. This is where he meets  Geel Piet. A native life term prisoner who gives Peekay a thorough  grounding in the arts of boxing.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel takes  Peekay through the rest of his education, a romance, overseas and further  towards his lifelong goal of being a boxing champion. I don't want to go  into detail for fear of spoiling it for you. The plot whilst important, is  almost unnecessary to enjoying this book. The style in which Courtenay  writes, is beautiful. It just sweeps you away. I almost feel justified in  taking some pride in this Australian Author however Bryce was born and  raised in South Africa so they have an equal claim to pride.<br /><br />Bryce  Courtenay is an interesting man. I actually met him once in Hawaii but  since this review is about his novel, I wont go into the author any  further. &quot;The Power of One&quot; was followed by the sequel  &quot;Tandia&quot; which finishes the story.

Each one is perfect and while they could be read independent of each other I would recommend tackling them in sequence if you want to maximize your enjoyment. The seven titles are, &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot;, &quot;The Honor of the Queen&quot;,  &quot;The Short Victorious War&quot;, &quot;Field of Dishonor&quot;,  &quot;Flag in Exile&quot;, &quot;Honor Among Enemies&quot;, &quot;In Enemy  Hands&quot; and &quot;Ashes of Victory&quot;.<br /><br />The feel of the  books is quite similar to David Feintuch's Nicholas Seafort series. It is  set in the far distant future amongst a competing variety of human empires.  Each empire controls an area of space including its stars and planets.  Honor Harrington is a member of the Royal Manticoran Navy, charged with the  protection of the realm in service to the queen. In the first book Honor is  a commander in charge of a smallish space craft. She has been sent to  purgatory, (Basilisk Station), as the direct result of physically rejecting  the advances of one of the aristocracy while in the academy, years before.<br /><br />To make matters worse, her ship is carrying an experimental weapon,  to the exclusion of most others, which has just amply shown its  shortcomings during Navy maneuvers. Her crew is embarrassed by their recent  performance in the exercise and many of them blame Honor for this as well  as the posting to Basilisk. Furthermore, when her ship arrives at Basilisk  her old enemy is the Captain in charge and promptly leaves the system for  questionable repairs, dumping the responsibility of the whole area in  Honor's lap with only one small ship to carry it out.<br /><br />The rest of  the story takes us through Honor's efforts to turn things around in the  face of an ever worsening situation. We learn to love her as she holds true  to the best principles that most people can only talk about. The other  characters are well defined and the details of the politics and human  dynamics are smooth. A further pleasure is the well thought out military  scenarios. The weaponry and craft performance has been designed by Weber to  provide a diverse yet plausible array of military confrontations.<br /><br />Luckily for us, the readers, this future has made available a  medical treatment that extends the lifetime of its citizens many fold. For  this reason I look forward to many more novels from David Weber, leading me  further into the life of Honor Harrington.dynamics are smooth.

Well this is that story brought to life, in a very real and gritty way. If you don't know what I am talking about, it is the story of the Roman who killed Christ on the cross and was cursed to wander the earth till the second coming.<br /><br /> In  Sadler's rendition, Casca is that Roman and Christ's curse goes on to  include, &quot;As you are, so shall you remain&quot;. What this means is  that Casca, being a soldier, will therefore remain a soldier through his  immortal search for the Christian god. This is a great plot device because  we, the reader, get to vicariously participate in every major battle for  the last two thousand years with a man who can not be killed. At least not  permanently.<br /><br /> It's true that I have a fascination with immortality.  (Strangely, I don't look forward to my own death). But even so, I think  most people, (well... guys), will enjoy these novels. There are 22 in total  but don't expect the last one to round out the series. They just stop;  apparently because Sadler was murdered while on a trip through Central  America.	2000-05-03
US	53078187	R1WG6RMPSPYYYJ	0671577948	912869365	The Domination	Books	5	5	10	N	Y	Master Racing	There have been quite a few good Alternative history novels but few have projected all the way from the distant past to the extreme future. S M Sterling's Domination novels are based on a significant divergence during the American Civil war. South Africa chose to take a more active role  supporting the south and although the North still won, many of the  strongest slave owning families, fled to South Africa.<br /><br /> The  combined peoples recreate themselves into the Draka, a military race who  believe in a destiny which makes them the rulers of the planet. They start  by conquering the whole of Africa and at the same time implementing radical  social reforms aimed at creating a true super-race. It goes beyond the Nazi  ambitions that we are familiar with, into the realms of indoctrination,  extreme physical training and even genetic engineering.<br /><br />Against  this growing power, is pitted the consolidated democracies of the west.  They outstrip the Draka in technological terms and significantly outnumber  them. At no time however, does this match-up seem one sided. At first  glance you might think your sympathies would be with the west. The  surprising thing is, that despite the brutal, violent and arrogant nature  of the Draka, we can't help but empathise with them. Stirling makes it  impossible for us to hate them because we understand them so well.<br /><br />  Even in the forth book, Drakon, where one of the superhuman Draka is  transported back in time into a parallel universe, our own, where she  intends to subvert the entire planet to her will, I could not but admire  her confidence, determination and strength. Stirling almost makes me wish  the law of the jungle still held true. Only after putting the book down do  you remember that superior force does not equate with superior morals.	2000-05-03

At first glance it seems to be a fantasy novel, then you think it might be a hard-boiled detective story, but in reality it is a love story. It is fairly typical of MacAvoy's work, all of which is superb.<br /><br />You will  find the main characters a little out of the ordinary. On the one hand we  have a, middle aged musician, worried Mother and on the other we have a  centuries old Chinese dragon transformed into approximately human form.<br /><br />That's as far as I am willing to go into the details. Suffice to  say that it is a quirky, delightful and warm story from a writer who knows  and thoroughly enjoys the business of writing. And if you love this book,  as I know you will, you may also want to try the sequel &quot;Twisting the  Rope&quot;.	2000-05-03

I like to think that these books started the popular trend in  fantasy, of featuring women in heroic roles. Paks, (the heroine in  question), manages to be a better soldier than most while still being  sensitive to her feelings and friends.<br /><br /> Unlike many works of  fantasy, Moon is more interested in the characters and their struggles and  triumphs than in the fantastic creations of her world. I'm not saying that  her world is not well rendered, it is, but it is the people in this story  that demand the reader's attention. They are real, emotional beings with  strengths, flaws and inconsistencies, just like the rest of us.<br /><br />  There is also a surprising amount of military detail in the story. In fact  it taught me a thing or two about medieval fighting both from a lone  warrior standpoint and that of an army.<br /><br /> Fair warning to those who  intend to read this series; start on the Friday night. At least that way  you won't jeopardise your job by coming in without any sleep.	2000-05-03

For some reason I started with &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, which is the sequel, and then went back to read the first novel. Speaker for the Dead is  a great book but does not stand alone. Its story is only completed by the  remaining books in the series. Ender's Game however, is just as good and is  also self contained.<br /><br /> Originally, the novel started out as a short  story, (or novella), called Ender's War. Card re-wrote much of it, fleshing  out the story, and in so doing created one of the finest works of science  fiction in existance. I haven't met anyone who has read it without being  impressed. Like all of Card's books, it is difficult to put down, teaches  us something about ourselves, makes us cry and it makes us cheer. Card is  always good but with Ender's Game, he is perfect.<br /><br />The title  character, Ender Wiggin, is a young boy who's whole life has been lived  under the stigma of being a third child. In a world where population  control is the only means of racial survival, he is the exception that  proves the rule. His very existance was only granted because the government  felt his genes and upbringing might produce the perfect strategist against  an implacable enemy.<br /><br /> The &quot;Buggers&quot; almost wiped out the  entire human race, last time they visited. The government is certain these  insect like creatures will not stop when they next decide to come. And so,  it is necessary to create a military genius, trained in every way possible,  hardened to fear and remorse, and knowing that there will be no second  chance at success. The fact that this person is a small boy, must not keep  them from performing their duty.<br /><br />Ender's Game tells the story of  what that boy's life is like. It is not a light tale and no punches are  pulled. Even so, I would recommend it to anyone over ten years old. Simply  because it does not shy away from the consequences of even brutal acts and  so, it has the power to open our eyes to the meaning of responsibility.  Please read this book... we all should.<br /><br />For those that are up on  their reading of Card's work, you may want to buy his latest; Ender's  Shadow. It revisits the War school from the point of view of Ender's most  worthy student, Bean. We get to see all those dramatic moments again but  not as we remember them.acts and  so, it has the power to open our eyes to the meaning of responsibility.

And given the quality of this book I find that truly sad. Harrison is of course one of the most prolific writers in the field of Science fiction and Minsky is a scientist with MIT, working in the area of A.I., who is more used to writing scientific articles than fiction. The two together bring a great story to life in an extremely believable way.<br />The \\"Turing Option\\" is set in the near future and concentrates on the experiences of a brilliant scientist who has just suffered a major brain trauma. His own cybernetic researches help doctors to bring him back to life and allow him to pursue his murderers. This pursuit leads him back to his research into artificial intelligence which it seems was the motivation behind the first attack.<br />The plot and story telling, whilst top notch, are not what prompted me to include the book on this page. No, it was the A.I. or M.I. (Machine Intelligence), that I became fascinated with. As far as I am concerned, the concept of a robotic entity has never been explored so well as in this novel. (yes I have read all of Asimov's robot stories). If you are at all interested in this area of science, then this book must be read.	2000-05-03

I read it in my first year of university. It was chosen mainly out of boredom and a liking for the cover  art. Wow! I couldn't buy and read the next two novels fast enough. There  were &quot;The Golden Torc&quot; and &quot;The Nonborn King&quot; and they  were better than the first. The last in the series, &quot;The  Adversary&quot;, was not written at that time and I spent an agonizing year  waiting for it. In the mean time I started reading other authors to feed my  new born habit.<br /><br />The plot is too complex to cover in the few  paragraphs that I am willing to write here. In fact the story is expanded  by several more novels that Julian May has since written. The Saga of the  Pliocene Exiles mainly follows a group of people who are irrevocably exiled  back in time to the Pliocene era. Not to worry, this is not a dinosaur  story. This is the period between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the  rise of homo sapiens, six million years ago.<br /><br />Some of the group  has voluntarily chosen exile to escape their life in the twenty first  century. A century which has seen the rise of extra sensory powers in  humanity and the introduction of the planet to a galactic community as a  result. Our time traveling companions travel through a one way time portal,  trained and ready to start a new life in the distant past. They expect to  find some sort of civilization when they arrive, presumably created by  fifty years of prior time travelers. Fair warning though. To get to this  point in the novel you will have to be patient as there are several  chapters devoted to the short term history of each member of the group.  This is necessary to tell us why they are going back but may seem to some  readers as a little dull. All I can say is stick with it.<br /><br />I won't  spoil it for those who I hope are going to read these books. However I will  say that the group is very surprised at what they find when they arrive  safely in the Pliocene. The remainder of May's series follows each  character through a rich tapestry of diverging and reconverging sub plots.  Our central group is eventually responsible for changing the world. Not  only six million years ago but also in the 21st century.group is very surprised at what they find when they arrive  safely in the Pliocene.

To them I say, it is a pity to let your prejudice get in the way of a great novel.<br /><br /> Battlefield Earth is technically a post apocalypse story. It is set at a time about a thousand  years after the event, though. The fall of Earth was not brought about by  ourselves. No, it was an alien mining corporation that brought us down.  Shades of Hitch Hikers Guide, don't you think?.<br /><br /> The bedraggled,  diseased remnants of humanity are blissfully unaware of their heritage. And  most of them don't seem to care. Most that is, except for the heroic main  character, Johnny Goodboy.<br /><br /> L Ron Hubbard takes us on a thrilling  ride on the coat tails of young Johnny as he struggles to bring the planet  Earth back under human control. What, on the surface, seems to be a fast  paced adventure novel, has depths which sometimes surprise and often leave  you thinking. But the essence that makes this novel so good, is the  heartfelt portrayal of a true underdog rising above the odds. It makes you  want to stand up and cheer. Hooray!	2000-05-03

It was Jean's first book, also the first in a great series of four books and lastly the first of its class in the now popular prehistory genre. The four novels in the series are &quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;,  &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot;.<br /><br /> Set in the transitional time between Neanderthal and Cromagnon, we  are told a tale like Kipling's, &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Only Mowgly is a  little girl named Ayla and she is raised by Neanderthals rather than  wolves. But this is no children's story.<br /><br /> Ayla is an outcast in her  adopted tribe and struggles against ostracism and physical assaults. Any  thing she can do better than her tribe is frowned on as not appropriate and  she struggles to do the things that the rest of them take for granted. Some  of these include the obvious displays of great strength but also the clever  supposition on the authors part, that Neanderthals memories are passed down  through the generations by inherited genetic traits. How can little Ayla  ever achieve that.<br /><br /> It all comes to a head in the first novel when  Ayla has a malformed baby. Not malformed in fact, just a half cast. I wont  go into any more detail. Suffice to say that I was hanging out for each new  novel in the series and then gobbled each in virtually a single sitting  when they arrived.	2000-05-03

But this is no ordinary man, he is over two thousand years old and has helped to father  most of the human race. He has faced death a hundred times and caused it  almost as often. He is Woodrow Wilson Smith otherwise known as Lazarus Long  or simply The Senior.<br /><br />This is one of Heinlein's longest works and  is reputed to have been published unedited. For me the novel has an  autobiographic feel to it. Almost as if Heinlein had to dredge the depths  of himself to fill it. There are so many anecdotes, tales, characters,  wisdoms and ideas in this book that you are in danger of choking. Or maybe  it's just the speed with which I usually read it that sets me to gasping.<br /><br />The story starts on Lazarus' death bed. Or at least that is what it  seems. One of his long distant descendants is deliberately forcing him to  remain alive in order to record the Senior's life wisdom. And what a life  it has been. Born in the early years of the twentieth century, our hero  takes us on a fast paced ride on the leading edge of man's expansion into  the universe. Sometimes a man of importance, sometimes a slave, he is  always entertaining and usually educational. In the end we are taken so far  into his tale that it leads us back into the past. Lazarus takes a ground  breaking trip into his own origins and meets his Parents again for the  first time in two millennia.<br /><br />It would be impossible to do this  book justice in any form of synopsis. However, you don't really need one  because if you are at all human, then you will have time enough for love.	2000-05-03
US	53078187	R3242LD1VTMOOW	0345348656	150650131	Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 1)	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Doubting Thomas	This double trilogy is quite famous, and for good reason. The six books in order are &quot;Lord Foul's Bane&quot;, &quot;The Illearth War&quot;, &quot;The Power that Preserves&quot;, &quot;Wounded Land&quot;, &quot;One Tree&quot;, &quot;White Gold Wielder&quot;.<br /><br /> Not everyone is a fan  of the books though, so beware. The reason for this is an irritating  feature, (at least in my opinion), of the main character, Thomas Covenant.  Basically he denies the reality of his whole experience through most of the  first three books. I mean really... Who can say what is real and what  isn't. Most of us operate from the paradigm that what seems real will be  treated as real until proven otherwise.<br /><br /> I'm glad I got that of my  chest. Now, where was I. What makes this series of novels excellent is it's  creativity. The creatures, places, natural laws, history, myths and gods  are all fabulously bizarre. Thinking about it now just makes me want to  dive back in and read the whole lot for the fourth time.<br /><br /> The story  is about Covenant's efforts to deal with the Devil of another world. Our  hero is hampered by leprosy and disbelief. Of the two, the second is the  larger problem by far. On his side is his white gold ring, which has  mysterious and mostly uncontrollable powers.<br /><br /> The broad plot is  fairly simple but hidden within that is a wealth of detail that makes the  whole tale come alive. The other interesting point is how long we live  inside the hero's head. There is no small thought or feeling that avoids  our inspection. Overall the chronicles are well worth a read if you want to  escape into a new world for a while.	2000-05-03

Stranger, as this book is known to Sci Fi buffs, is top of mylist as far as Heinlein novels go. It narrowly beats &quot;Time Enoughfor Love&quot; for first place. It's a Bible for the 60's in more than one way. Only this time it was written competently. Yes it is a Messianic story but it is a Bible in another way. It was written in 1960 and was a precursor for the heady rebellious days to come. Unfettered sex, rampant hedonism, anarchy were all included in this &quot;how to&quot; manual. Even feminism is present but don't be too shocked, Heinlein still managed to avoid being politically correct in his condescension of the female gender.<br /><br />The novel is about a man from Mars. (Ha, Ha). No I am serious. It always struck me as odd that all of those man from Mars stories were false advertising.  They should have claimed creature/alien from Mars because that is what they meant. In Stranger it really is a MAN from Mars. Michael Valentine Smith, the son of intrastella travelers from Earth, raised on Mars by, (you guessed it), Martians, is coming home.<br /><br />Unfortunately this young man is at the center of more controversy than just his upbringing. It seems that according to world law he is now the owner of the fourth planet, Mars.  And as such he is likely to become the puppet of the first powerful political [person] that comes along. Luckily he is saved by a friendly and beautiful nurse who kidnaps Michael and places him under the protective wing of Jubal Harshaw. Jubal, (the alter ego of Heinlein), is a Doctor come Lawyer come Writer who lives in a secure palace type of accommodation and practices Freedmonite economics in his spare time. That is to say he is strongly in favour of smaller government.<br /><br />Although Michael starts out quite naive and trusting, we know from the beginning that he has some unusual abilities, care of his Martian foster parents. Included amongst the many, are seemingly full control over his bodily functions and the power to make offending items and people disappear, permanently. It is a situation reminiscent of a toddler with a loaded gun in a crowded room.<br /><br />Eventually through the careful tutorage of Jubal and his harem of beautiful assistants, Michael becomes worldly enough to leave the roost and learn more of life outside Jubal's home. Before he leaves though, they all have fun fighting off the underhanded and decidedly dangerous attempts of the world president to recapture Michael.<br /><br />Michael then spends a troubling time trying to understand humanity by traveling, reading and working in several occupations. He is accompanied in these efforts by the original nurse that rescued him. Eventually he groks, (fully understands), his own species and becomes aware of the meaning of life. Naturally this is the start of what appears to be a very popular religion, complete with miracles, disciples and resurrection.<br /><br />Stranger is chock full of great quotes and fascinating ideas. If you can't learn any thing from this book, then you are either God or dead.ending items and people disappear, permanently.

It is also the first book written and published by David Feintuch. It has none of the hesitancy or unnecessary elaboration typical of an author's first  efforts. Instead it is adventure and complex characterizations boiled down  into a strong, flavorsome and Moorish broth.<br /><br />The story follows the  life of Nick Seafort as he starts out on his first voyage as a midshipman.  We quickly learn of the society from which Nick has so recently sprung.  Earth is the center of a small interstellar empire, held together by the  governmentally sanctioned church and the Navy which serves it.<br /><br />The  society is based upon the British empire in the 1700's. And in the same way  as then, the empire's far flung outposts take so long to reach that the  navy performs more than just a defensive role.<br /><br />Nick having been  raised by a fundamentalist Father is ideally suited to Navy life. He  suckled on the teat of black and white perceptions and thus takes the  Navy's regulations as seriously as the original Captain Horatio Hornblower  of the British navy. This attitude causes him great anguish as the  regulation force him to betray his friends, and himself.<br /><br />Due to a  series of harsh accidents Nick finds himself officially in charge of his  vessel in a role that he is quite certain he is unable to complete. On top  of this his crew and fellow officers share his doubts and to make matters  worse the ship's passengers feel his assumption of the captaincy seals  their doom.<br /><br />I am unwilling to spoil any more of the story for  potential readers. I will happily guarantee any ready will get their  money's worth from this book. The books in the series include  &quot;Midshipman's Hope&quot;, &quot;Challenger's Hope&quot;,  &quot;Prisoner's Hope&quot;, &quot;Fisherman's Hope&quot;, &quot;Voices of  Hope&quot; and &quot;Patriarch's Hope&quot;. They are all at least as good  as the first so feel free to buy them as a set.to buy them as a set.	2000-05-03
US	53078187	R2VK6TEE83SEUC	0345331761	700465720	The Vang: The Military Form	Books	5	19	19	N	N	No escape, no hope	Oh boy, this is one scary story. I remember having some fabulous nightmares after reading the first novel in this two part series, (not including Star Hammer). &quot;The Vang: The military form&quot; is fast  paced, graphic and horrifically personal. Rowley wrote it nearly ten years  after the movie &quot;Alien&quot; was released, so he must have been aware  that comparisons would be made. In reality the similarities are more in  feel than in format. If Hollywood ever gets around to making a film of the  Aliens reaching earth, they could do a lot worse than to use Rowley's book  as a template.<br /><br />The Vang is an aggressive militaristic species that  was supposed to have been exterminated by a race, now long dead. The  evidence of this is found in archaeological records as well as a large  number of post nova solar systems. It seems that the only way this ancient  race found to eradicate the Vang, once it had a foot hold on a planet, was  to destroy the solar system with a special &quot;Star Hammer&quot; weapon.  Such a high price was deemed necessary because the Vang's method of  expansion was always at the expense of the species around it. In fact this  race was quite happy to utilize the bodies of any other life form as a  temporary source of mobility and food. Over all, the Vang are not pleasant  neighbors.<br /><br />The story starts some thousands of years after the last  Vang sighting. They are almost considered a myth by this time and so an  illegal prospector is unprepared for what he finds on an old derelict in a  remote asteroid belt. Naturally he becomes the Vang's first host and as the  story progresses we find that this species has many forms, like bees or  ants. The genetic codes for each form are contained in each individual and  will only be expressed under certain conditions. For example when a bee  hive looses it's queen some of the new hatchlings will automatically become  queens.<br /><br />The horror of the story is always generated from a human's  point of view as the Vang manage to infest one of the outer worlds,  undetected. We are allowed to follow their take-over from multiple view  points; the as yet uncaptured humans, the Vang's victims (who are impotent  spectators to their body's horrific actions) and the Vang themselves. The  Vang are intelligent. They have individual desires and perspectives but are  ruled by a hive mentality. It is fascinating and creepy to get into the  mind of such a powerfully destructive life form.<br /><br />I could not put  this book down. As soon as it was finished I went straight on to read the  sequel, &quot;The Vang: The Battlemaster&quot; which shows us a new twist  on the Vang and what drives them. If you're not afraid of nightmares and  you love a book that will not let you go, then consider this novel a must.n's  point of view as the Vang manage to infest one of the outer worlds,  undetected.
