I read it while traveling from Buffalo NY to El Paso TX, which was about 8 hours.  To me the end seemed a little forced which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  Up until then it is a defenite page turner that will keep you guessing and anxious to read the next page.  It has some scientific mumbo jumbo but defenitly not too much to turn off those of us who aren't that scientifically inclined.  Of course that's just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2005-06-19

But other than that this book was well written.  The story line is plausible in any day and age and is not limited to the time when it was written (1975, I believe).  It is basically about a vindictive vet who links up with a terrorist group to plan and execute the most shocking and destructive terrorist plot in history.  But the best part of the book has to be the gift that our friendly veteran gives to his ex-wife to make amends, you have to read it to understand it fully.  It really is a shame Thomas Harris does not write more novels.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2005-06-19

It was just a little too short for me.  The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.  The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game.  You will fly through this book, it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it, even after that mild short coming I mentioned.  Just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2004-06-26

This book is not intended to be an in depth study of the battle.  It is intended to give you a guided tour of the battlefield.  It succeeds quite nicely in doing this.  I really enjoyed it very much.  I know a lot about the battle and have been there a couple of times and next time I go, I will defenitly be taking this book along for the ride.  If you have never been to the battlefield this is a good book to read and then go on a tour yourself.  Of course that's just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2004-06-26

I think this is a great book for people who are interested in history, especially the civil war.  It is a great introduction to the events surronding Antietam that can lead to a more in depth study of them.  Just my opnion, but I highly reccomend reading this book.	2004-06-25

The story was very compelling though.  This series (including Rise to Rebellion)could have easily been 3 books instead of 2.  The story could have benefitted from having more of adams, frankilin etc... in it and less of the time gaps.  However I highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction.	2003-11-29

I do kind of like how he showed how different people's lives intertwined based on 60's events but overall I think the book lacked.  I think if he just would have stayed with the characters in the begining and not gotten into the side stories it would have been a much better book.  However I am sure any who grew up in the 60's would probably really like this book, myself on the other hand did not.	2003-09-06

The only problem I can see anyone having with this book is trying to decide if its a happy ending or bad ending.

Without spoiling the ending I will say it end much different and much better than the movie.	2003-09-01

He wrote this book in 1970(published in 1982) and it started the series that holds his whole literary universe together.  A little tough to read especially if you have been introduced to King through his newer works, it is still by far one of his best.  Once you read this book you will be compelled to get into the series.  I highly reccomend the book and the series.  But you don't have to take my word for it.	2003-09-01

The only one that was better was the original Dracula by Bram Stoker, but then again it is hard to beat the original.  This was a very scary story.  I made the mistake of reading this book when I was working alone at night with a rain storm going on outside...not a smart idea.<br />The book takes a little bit to get going but when it does it never lets up.  What is great about this book is what is so good about King's early work, no character is safe.  I will pretty much guarantee you that you will be turning on a few extra lights at night while this book is still in the back of your mind.  Great read for King fans and anyone who wants to have a little chill sent down their spine.  Of course that's just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2003-09-01

Not by any means the best book I ever read, it was still quite enjoyable.  One of the best things about the book was the description of the spider attacks.  Basically hope that nothing crawls across your arm or falls on you while you are reading the book.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2003-09-01

It just lacked a couple of things.  The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself.  One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends.  However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book.  It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book.	2003-09-01

Hannibal Lecter has to be one of the most enduring literary and film villians of all time.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but if you're in the same boat don't let it stop you from reading the book.  The book is still very creepy and worth the read.  But it does help if you read Red Dragon first.  Read this series in order and you will feel immensly satisfied when you complete it.	2003-09-01

Even if you have seen the movie still read the book.  Here Michael Crichton does what he tried to (and failed) to do in Andromena Strain.  This book combines science with a great story.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, so to speak and I couldn't put in down.  Great edition to anybody's library.

This book was somewhat exciting but after I was done with it I didn't feel as satisfied as I did after I read the first one.  Actually the book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars but there isn't something allocated for that.  It is a good rainy day book, but there are a lot of better rainy day books out there.  To me it just seems like Crichton can't put 2 great books out in a row.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.	2003-08-31

I am starting to become more of a Jeff Shara fan this book solidified it.  In his other books much of the action is centered around battles, that is not the case in this book.  Much of the action is centered around the behind the scenes stories that led to the battles.  I was very impressed with that aspect of it.  Anyone who is even slightly intrested in how the the revolution came about will be hooked from page one.  Highly reccomend this book.	2003-06-10

This is one of the most influential novels ever written.  Even Stephen King wrote a vampire story.  While at first it is a bit awkward to read since it's in the form of letters, journal entries and even a newspaper article the reader soon gets used to it and it quickily turns into a page turner.  The chapter involving the ship is one of the scariest I have ever read.  Great addition to anybody's library.	2003-06-08

I am usually very impressed with all of King's work even his short stories.  It seemed to &quot;light&quot; compared to the normal King fare.  The only two stories in the collection that even make this readable are &quot;Everything's Eventual&quot; and &quot;The Little Sister's of Eluria&quot;.  Other than those two stories, instead of fighting to out the book down, I had to fight to keep reading.	2003-06-07

For one it offers the most insight into the characters as well as Roland's present world.  The best part of the story however are the parallels that King puts in between our world and the world in the book.  If you were only lukewarm on the series based on the first two books, this one will defenitly get you hooked.  At the very least you should read this book to meet Blaine.	2003-06-06

I think devoting an entire novel to Roland's past hurt the overall story a bit because they did not advance the quest far in this novel.  I think while the story was good, Roland's mysterious past was one of the driving forces behind the series's success.  I would have prefered if the story was spread out over the 2nd,3rd &amp; 4th books.  Overall the book was good and should be read by both King devotees and fans of the series.	2003-06-06

To be honest I don't think the book is quite worth 5 stars but it is better than 4 stars. Very good continuation of the gunslinger.  Gets the overall story of the series moving well.  A decent amount of suspense is thrown in too.  Pretty sure after you read this book you won't look at lobster the same way again.<br />This book basically introduces Rolands companions for his quest for the tower and the baggage they bring to the quest.  Odetta is one of the better characters in King's universe.  HIghly reccommend this series and book to everyone.	2003-06-06

This is by far my favorite.  A very suspenseful and rich storyline.  There are just some books that you feel extremely satisfied after reading and this is defenitly one of them.

However I was very disappointed and I am very glad I did not read this book as my first Stephen King experience.  It, to me is simply an average book.  Once in awhile there are some scary moments but all in all I felt the book was a bit of a let down.  If you are not a die hard Stephen King fan I highly suggest skipping this book, but that's just me.	2003-06-05

While this book does stand on its own and you do not have to read the previous two, I highly reccomend it.  The battle scenes are well illustrated by the author as well as the horror lee must have felt of not being able to feed his troops.  I think the best thing in this book is the choice the author made on the characters to center them on:  Lee, Grant and Chamberlin.  I highly reccomend this book as well as the whole series (Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels &amp; The Last Full Measure) to anybody even if you are not a huge fan of historical fiction.	2003-06-03

Outside of The Killer Angels this is probably the best historical fiction I've read.  The best part of this book is the relationship between jackson and a little girl.<br />One other thing that I enjoyed about this book was the way the author showed how the North could have ended the war much earlier if they had listened to their lower ranking generals opposed to the peacocks that Lincoln was pressured into appointing.

I have seen that one of the criticisms of this book is that it leaves out a good portion of the war, namely then general, soon to be president zachary taylor's role in the war.  I agree that is a weakness of the book, it's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  However, the book does shed light on the often forgotten war, namely General Scott's march on mexico city.  I particularly enjoyed the account of many of those who would become famous 13 years later in the civil war, such as lee, grant, meade, beaugard, jackson, longstreet, among others.  Overall the book may not be as exciting as the author's others but it is enjoyable.  Good addition to anybody's historical fiction library.	2003-06-03

This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be.  It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000.  Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book.  If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.<br />The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books.  A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind.  I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book.	2003-04-27

But then it just got worse as every page went on.  It took me 2 weeks to read this book, which is way too long for a book this short.  It was just too dry.  It seemed more like a scientific manual than a novel.  I like reading Sci-fi but it almost seemed like you had to be a Dr. to understand what was going on.
