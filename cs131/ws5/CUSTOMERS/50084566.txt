US	50084566	RE37ESOHC9MG1	0451216776	295651663	Dispatch (Signet Novel)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Different!	The horror novels of Bentley Little are always a little brainier and more socially conscious than those of his peers. Even when he's writing about vampires or haunted houses, he's tackling subjects like racism and conformity. In DISPATCH, Little examines not only the power of the written word, but he takes us on a darkly satirical journey through the last half of the 20th century. Closer to THE IGNORED than to his other novel's, it's a first-person narrative that riffs on Little's usual bete noires and concerns a man who can accomplish anything he wants by writing letters. A brilliant novel by one of contemporary fiction's top talents.	2005-09-30
US	50084566	R2KRNJKJL0GIZE	0451212800	43298823	The Resort	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Bentley is Great!!!	Bentley Little has long been one of my favorite horror writers. One of the few authors in the genre with both a social conscience and a sense of humor, he's the Jonathan Swift of the field. THE RESORT, as expected, is both scary and satiric. Little takes on vacation getaways, social classes and even reality television in this tale of a family stranded at a haunted resort in the middle of the Arizona desert. As always, the characters are likeable, believable and very well-drawn, and the horrific events are truly outrageous and original. This is Little's 15th book, and the reading he's had such staying power is obvious--he's a great writer.	2004-09-24
US	50084566	R10UE4FDOAFO99	0451206878	946670143	The Return	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Scary!	After reading this great book and being thoroughly terrified by some of the most disturbingly original imagery I've come across this year, I was shocked to see the low scores this book got from readers. Maybe you have to be from the southwest to appreciate the achievement here. Compared to Dean Koontz's BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, which seems to have taken its Four Corners info from a map, Little knows this country and creates an epic novel of horror from this epic landscape. Scary, intense and original. By the way, I liked the ending and thought it DID tie up all loose ends.	2004-05-28
US	50084566	R3J6CW2HCCA76U	0451209540	450762437	The Policy	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Brilliant...of course	Little is the master of horrific satire aimed at the institutions of contemporary society {the university, the chain store, the homeowners' association, the post office} and here he takes on his biggest target yet--insurance companies. Unlike some other high-profile horror authors who've gone soft in their old age, Little is still up for anything. His work is chock full of graphic sex and violence...as well as believable sympathetic characters and thought-provoking social commentary. Another great novel by horror's vest writer.	2003-09-12

I don't know how he does it, but for the past decade, Bentley Little has been turning out the best and most underrated horror fiction on the planet. Hot on the heels of THE COLLECTION, his sublime book of short stories, comes THE RETURN, and epic tale of vanished civilizations, the rape of the West and one of the most original horror creations I've ever read. If the monster is dispatched a tad too quickly (a Little trademark, unfortunately), the rest of the book makes up for it with compelling characters and some truly creepy setpieces. Besides, as wiser men than me have said, it's the journey that's important not the destination. More superficial readers may be put off by the abruptness of the ending, but it's nowhere near as bad as King's IT, where, after a thousand pages, the reunited heroes gangrape a girl and kill a giant spider to save the world. THE RETURN is another in Little's increasingly impressive ouevre.	2002-09-09
US	50084566	R1GOVOI99YKMNO	0451206096	266675919	The Collection	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Absolutely the best!	Little's fiction has never appealed to either the pseudointellectual horror crowd or the grue-minded teenage audience. His readership seems to be genuinely literate well-educated adults, and THE COLLECTION proves why. Little's fiction is about ideas. And as both an English grad student and a longtime horror fan, I can safely say that his works are among the few these days that can be legitimately analyzed in an academic setting. He knows how short stories work, and he knows why. In these 32 masterful tales, Little's wild imagination and searing social conscience redefine short fiction for a new generation. Some other readers appear to be confused by the endings of some pieces or to misunderstand their point, but the answers are all there in the text. That is what I admire most about Little. He doesn't spoonfeed or talk down to his audience. He writes to a smart crowd. And I for one appreciate it.	2002-07-16

Perhaps most of interest to his fans are the short introductions which precede each work and explain where the author got the idea for each piece. A must-read for all serious horror fans.	2002-06-07

I happen to think he's one of the most original and daring authors working today. He's not afraid to tackle big topics or contemporary issues and he's not afraid to take a stand. Like THE STORE, his amazing satirical novel about the Wal-Martization of America, THE ASSOCIATION is a stunning work that addresses the fascistic bent of homeowners' associations. Keep 'em coming, Bentley!	2001-11-06
US	50084566	R3I9SA3XOPROPC	0451204123	161070434	The Association	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Brilliant	Bentley Little is the best horror author working today, and it baffles me why publishers who give big advances to writers of derivative dreck like MEG allow Mr. Little to languish in obscurity. THE ASSOCIATION is the best book I've read all year, with raves from both King and Koontz, yet it's almost impossible to find in a bookstore.<br />In this novel, Barry and Maureen Welch move to a small Utah town and buy a home in an exclusive gated community. There they learn about the dark side of democracy as they are first annoyed by and then terrorized by the restrictive rules of their homeowners' association. Funny, scary and all too real, this is one great novel.<br />Although I won't go into detail here, let me also say that some of the criticism leveled at this book by other readers seems to stem from the fact that those readers DID NOT UNDERSTAND SIMPLE PLOT POINTS!	2001-10-10
US	50084566	RYBMFML5WQWVA	0451204123	161070434	The Association	Books	5	2	3	N	N	True and Terrifying	Bentley Little has turned into the master chronicler of the horror of modern life. With THE IGNORED he took on conformity and the depersonalization of society, with THE STORE he addressed the death of main streets in this Wall Street driven world. Now, with THE ASSOCIATION, he takes on gated communities and homeowners' associations, and the result is a brilliant skewering of contemporary neighborhood life. It's sharply satiric, but it's also scary as hell, and Mr. Little has woven together these strands in a page-turning manner. Hopefully, this will catapault Bentley Little into Stephen King/John Grisham territory and give him the bestseller status he so richly deserves.	2001-09-06

People either love him or hate him. But I find it curious that readers who deride his work and find his writing style not to their taste keep reading him. I read one Ruby Jean Jensen novel, for example, didn't care for it, and never read anything by her again.<br />From my point of view, Mr. Little's characterizations are spot on. I find his people and their internal lives, their ruminations, very believable. Having recently lost my father to cancer, I also found the portions of THE WALKING that deal with Miles and his father extremely well done and quite affecting. Mr. Little not only has an incredible imagination but he is also able to create characters with whom I, at least, can empathize. I believe him to be one of the top three horror authors currently writing.	2001-08-02

There are mistakes (the string sound on TRILOGY was from an ARP string synthesizer not a mini-Moog), and the musical analyses are laughable (Piano Concerto No. 1 is clearly a Romantic composition not a serialist work; and while we are told that &quot;Abbadon's Bolero&quot; resolves into a C chord at the end, something anyone with a copy of the sheet music would know, the authors fail to notice that the second impression of Karn Evil 9 is performed in the style of Dave Brubeck as a tribute to the &quot;Rondo&quot; composer). Moreover, the important question is not addressed: what happened to Keith Emerson? Emerson has gone from writing the concerto to endlessly performing &quot;America.&quot; What happened to his ambition and why has he produced so little new music over the past twenty years? Even for the &quot;comeback&quot; album BLACK MOON, he simply recycled three-year old songs from CHANGING STATES. Does he have writer's block? I guess we'll have to wait for another ELP book to find out.	2001-05-22
US	50084566	R2WQFULIFH3ZAP	0451200152	728640065	The Town	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Brilliant pastiche	Little is one of the most accomplished horror writers around, and it is the literary scope of his work that I have always admired most. He is well aware of the genre's history and often tosses in referential &quot;in jokes&quot; for serious horror fans. Here he knowingly gives us a covert catalog of Stephen King's entire ouvre, in a way that is both clever and unobtrusive. With a wink and a smile, he references all of King's work through ROSE MADDER...and he manages to still create an original and scary story with a unique ethnic background. I don't think there's anything Little can't do at this point. He's a genius.	2001-05-11
US	50084566	R2IX6SYEAGYFRB	0451201744	232812399	The Walking	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Great Characters	The problem with most contemporary horror is the absence of realistic characters with whom the reader can identify. One author who shall remain nameless always has main characters who are sex-obsessed simpletons, one has every character be an unbelivable action hero. But Little's characters are always quietly believable, with vivid internal lives. We get to know these people, and we care about them. Often, they remind us of people we know.      THE WALKING is no exception. Miles Huerdeen has a stereotypical job but is anything but stereotypical. Even the way Little describes the detective agency at which he works is original. And his relationship with his father and his ex-wife ring very true to me as someone who's been there. Couple this with astounding imagery and a plot that unfolds slowly and carefully (although too many jerks have given it away here), and you have the best horror novel I've read all year.	2001-05-11

There've been a lot of complaints about this novel from prudish lily-livered readers who obviously aren't interested in true horror, but from this hardcore fan's perspective, Little has created what is by far the most original and provocative haunted house story in decades. I also found his characterizations to be right on the money and both liked and believed in all five main protagonists (although, being a teacher myself, I wasn't thrilled with his treatment of the high school instructor). This novel also had a lot to say about recovered memories, the influence of the past on the present, the importance of individual choice and the lingering effects of the holocaust. Little is a major talent and this is an extraordinarily strong novel. As for those who complain about the graphic violence and sexual content of this work--that's why it's called &quot;horror.&quot; Go read mysteries if you want your sex and death diluted into tame family fare.	2001-05-11

I loved the relationship between Rich and Robert, the two brothers, and I loved the way Little let them refer back to incidents in their lives without giving us all the details. It lent an aura of believability to everything. And I found the end heart-wrenching. I had tears in my eyes--which never happens to me with horror novels. This is a great book.	2001-05-11

Bentley Little takes the old canard that &quot;evil is banal&quot; and illustrates this point in a most unique and original way. As always, Little has created believable, sympathetic characters that the reader cares about and placed them in a plot that is impossible to predict. He never gets the press of King, Koontz or Barker, but for my money Bentley Little is better than them all.	2000-12-13

With THE WALKING, he does it again. An unpredictable and epic work that canvases America from the Old West to contemporary Los Angeles, it deftly explores the effect the past has on the present and subtly hints that some of our most cherished national myths may not be quite correct. Scary and profound, filled once again with the realistic characters for which he is known, THE WALKING is the work of a master. Even more rewarding for longtime Little fans is the way characters from previous novels are woven into the fabric of this wonderful tapestry. Gordon and Marina Lewis from THE REVELATION are here, as is FBI Agent Rossiter from THE SUMMONING. Of course, Little's old nom de plume Phillip Emmons gets a typically sly mention as well. Horror doesn't get any better than this.	2000-11-15

Why  Signet isn't putting more muscle behind Little confounds me (am I the only  one to notice that Signet put a photo of Owl Goingback dressed in an  embarrassing Indian costume on his first paperback while Little, after ten  or so books, has NEVER had his photo on a dustjacket?

Little's fiction has always dealt in a very literary and  metaphoric manner with real life horrors, and here he addresses the  influence the past has on the present, particularly the extent to which our  families and our childhood memories define us as adults.      Several  readers have denounced the book because of its graphic sexual content (I  guess gruesome killings are okay but sex is unacceptable?). A word to these  people: Yes, the book is horrific. That's why it's called a HORROR novel.  Duh.	2000-02-09
