Once of the most difficult aspects of our application process is the series of very difficult .NET questions, which determine the applicant's understanding of C# and the .NET CLR.  If you read this book before taking our .NET test, not only will you pass, but you'll probably be able to put some of the testers to shame.  This is one of the best books I've read on the \\"under the hood\\" aspects of the CLR. <br /> <br />This book is filled with tips (e.g. gotcha #12 - compiler warnings may not be benign), which are then followed by an explanation of what the problem is, and how it can be resolved.  In the example above, the author describes how .NET will allow you to do things that you probably shouldn't be allowed to do.  In this particular example, the programmer used \\"=\\" instead of \\"==\\", and failed to mark a method in a derived class with the \\"override\\" keyword.  This book also does an excellent job describing some of the differences between C# and VB.NET.  For example, the author illustrates that the sequence of initialization is not the same between the two languages.   <br /> <br />In terms of organization, when the author identifies a \\"gotcha\\", there is a clear code example provided that exploits the problem.  The author even displays a large \\"X\\" next to the code, so you know not to use it.  After discussing how to resolve the problem, the author usually provides code that is safe to use (which is identified with a large check mark next to it). <br /> <br />Without a doubt, this is the best book I have read on the subject of things to look out for in the .NET framework.  The issues discussed in this book should be known by every .NET developer.  At least read the book before your next job interview. <br />	2005-08-14

I was very impressed with the depth of material, the tricks that are actually possible with a home setup, and the various tips the author provides for better, more organized video.  Many of the revolutionary techniques used in films even 10 years ago can be easily duplicated with a simple MiniDV camcorder and a personal computer. <br /> <br />The author really proceeds from the standpoint that the reader has a camcorder, has tried to make a movie or two, and really wants some ideas for improvement.  He begins with some excellent tips for organizing raw footage and proceeds through all aspects of the filmmaking process.  The author suggests using a clap board to not only get a visual identification of the take information, but by \\"clapping\\" the board before the take, you have a way to make sure your audio and video are synchronized. <br /> <br />The author also covers how to perform some really interesting special effects.  The most common of which is chroma-keying (or using blue screen).  This is actually relatively easy to do, assuming you have a good backdrop and decent lighting.  The author even takes the reader through the process of building a blue screen for under $30.  Some additional special effects techniques include \\"bullet time\\", made famous by the Matrix films, and how to produce a 3D film. <br /> <br />The author does a really good job going through the whole filmmaking process, from storyboarding to post production.  This book will give new filmmakers an excellent idea of what it takes to produce a film, and provides some tips on the tools necessary to do right. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-14

This book would be more accurately called Web Mapping with MapServer Illustrated.  If you read this book with the understanding of using MapServer, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />The author does an excellent job of guiding the reader from installing MapServer, to collecting mapping data, to actually implementing your solution on the web (including using web services).  If you follow the author's directions, you will be able to quickly get a mapping system in place.  However, through further reading, it becomes obvious that the initial configuration of a mapping system is pretty trivial compared to the actual collection, storage, and implementation of mapping information. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I was very impressed with the author's depth and breadth of knowledge in the subject of electronic mapping.  It is obvious the author knows what he is talking about, but is able to discuss issues in a way that does not alienate the beginner.  In any case, this book is a fascinating read to get an idea of what some commercial mapping applications (e.g. MapQuest) might look like behind the scenes. <br />	2005-08-14

Perhaps that makes me kind of a geek.  Maps can help people understand experiences (like vacations), cultures, and can even help in decision making.  Maps are just neat.  This book (at over 500 pages!) contained tips and ideas on everything I ever thought about doing with maps, and then some! <br /> <br />This book covers so many mapping topics, it's amazing.  From tools and techniques for determining the shortest route between two points, to labeling your photographs with GPS information, to building a \\"neverlost\\" for your car, to building maps to help in decision making.   The book really contains a little for everyone: from basic information to understand cartography, to using your GPS device to show where on the planet you've been. <br /> <br />O'Reilly did a really nice job with the printing of this book, as the whole thing is in color.  For mapping applications, that's a necessity, and made this book stand above some of the others in this category.  Additionally, the author does a really good job appealing to a wide audience and making many of the hacks interesting to as many types of  people as possible.  I have read some complaints that this book was printed before the Google Maps API became available, but that's certainly something that can be covered in the second edition. <br /> <br />This is a great book for the mapping hobbyist.  The book contains a lot of great ideas, tips, and information on tools to really make the most of creating and using maps in your life. <br />	2005-08-14

This is absolutely the best book on observing the night sky that I've read.  It's excellent and without a doubt written by some real pros.  I've been thinking of buying a telescope, and I'm glad I read this book before I put down any money-I might not have purchased the right telescope for my needs. <br /> <br />The authors begin with a really good explanation of the various types of telescopes available, the range of prices, and what to expect (in terms of quality and optics) in each category, as well as some general recommendations depending on what your interests might be (e.g. astrophotography vs. general observing). <br /> <br />Of course, the book contains an excellent section on the constellations and their locations.  Additionally, the authors illustrate how to read star charts and describe a couple of the most popular stellar catalogs.  There are also quite a few tips and ideas for improving your observation experience including different ideas on how to dark-adapt.  I just figured that living near a lot of lights would make it impossible to see anything in the night sky.  As the authors point out, light can make the observation experience more difficult, but it can still be enjoyable and rewarding. <br /> <br />I would absolutely recommend this book to the amateur astronomer who is really serious about improving the night time viewing experience.  This is an excellent book that really increased my understanding and appreciation of astronomy. <br />	2005-08-14

Do you find yourself always picking the same options every time you create a project in Visual Studio?  I have the sense that a lot of Visual Studio developers get comfortable with a certain ritual of options, never really getting the sense for all that Visual Studio has to offer.  This book absolutely opened my mind in terms of what Visual Studio can do, and how it can be tweaked to work better the way you want it to. <br /> <br />Visual Studio contains so many features to make developers' lives easy.  For example, did you know that Visual Studio supports build events?  When a build is successfully compiled (or even if it's unsuccessful), VS can be programmed to perform certain tasks depending on the status of your build.  What if you always work with a certain custom datatype.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a custom visualizer created to easily examine the contents of the object while at a break point?  In my opinion, this hack (#43) is one of the most useful ones in the book (for what I do, at least). <br /> <br />If you find yourself doing the same thing every day in Visual Studio, chances are you don't know what it's even capable of.  This book goes a long way to show you exactly what it can do.  By hacking Visual Studio, you can make it do exactly what you need. <br />	2005-07-02

While it's by no means a perfect browser, it is a very good one.  While reading this book I was blown away by the sheer number of tweaks and customizations that Firefox supports.  This is the most comprehensive book I've seen available on Firefox. <br /> <br />Like the other books in the \\"Hacks\\" series, this one lists 100 different tips and tricks, divided into sections including such topics as security, web developer power tools, using XML, and getting involved with the Firefox community.  My two favorite hacks (for no other reason than I think they're really cool) are how to edit Firfox configuration files, and how to work with SVG graphics on Firefox.   <br /> <br />Like I mentioned before, if you're just a casual internet user, chances are you don't even have a copy of Firefox, and that's fine.  However, if you're a power user, this is the best book out there on all things Firefox.  It's an excellent resource to make a very good browser even better. <br />	2005-07-02

O'Reilly publishes some of the best technical books available, but unfortunately, most of their books are designed as references-not something you would normally read from cover to cover.  The \\"Developer's Notebook\\" series attempts to fill this gap by providing an easy to read book that is actually designed to be read from cover to cover. <br /> <br />There are a lot of new features in the new version of C#, and unless you've been reading every MSDN article for the last year, chances are there are a lot of new features you won't know how to use.  Enter this book.  After going through this book, I feel I have a pretty good understanding of what generics are and how to use them,  I understand delegate covariance and contravariance, and have a pretty good understanding of many of the new features of Visual Studio 2005.  Not only does this book cover all these topics, but it covers them in a way that is easy to follow.  The author also does a good job making the topic seem relevant and useful to whatever you might be doing in your work. <br /> <br />One of the things I really liked about this series is the layout.  Each chapter begins with an introduction about the topic.  Immediately after the introduction is a section called \\"How do I do that?\\", where you'll see some code examples relevant to the topic.  Following the code sample is a section called \\"What just happened?\\", where the author breaks down all the code you just saw into its important pieces.  There is then a section called \\"What about...\\" which goes through scenarios concerning what would happen if you did something specific to the code you saw (e.g. what happens if you attempt to add an integer value to a strongly-typed list that accepts an object of type Employee).  Finally, there is a section called \\"Where can I learn more?\\" where the author discusses some additional resources for the topic. <br /> <br />I found this book to be very thorough, fun to read, and exactly what a developer wanting to learn C# 2005 would want to read.  If you want to learn more about the next version of the .NET framework and Visual Studio, this is the book you want to read. <br />	2005-07-02

This series aims to provide hands-on tutorials for some of the latest technology.  The author does an excellent job covering some of the new features and changes in the upcoming ASP.NET 2.0. <br /> <br />This book works best when you read it sitting in front of the Visual Studio 2005 IDE.  The author intends the reader to follow along, doing their own coding, to learn the concepts discussed.   <br /> <br />One thing I really enjoyed about this book is the organization.  I'm a professional ASP.NET developer, there are things I like about ASP.NET and things I dislike about it.  Lee did an excellent job covering a lot of the new and exciting features of ASP.NET right up front, which builds the readers enthusiasm for the rest of the book.  Finally I can set focus on a control!  Finally I can cross-post forms!  Finally I can control visual inheritance!  Sure these issues may not be all that important, but they're things current ASP.NET developers have been clamoring for, and they keep the reader engaged through the material. <br /> <br />I think my favorite section of the book is Chapter 3: Web Parts.  This chapter is not for the faint of heart-there are lots of juicy coding details, which developers will absolutely eat up.  This chapter also covers one of the most interesting aspects of the revamped ASP.NET-the ability to easily create portal applications.  The reader is stepped through some excellent examples, from building to personalization. <br /> <br />I found this to be an excellent introduction to the ASP.NET 2.0 framework.  As some other reviewers have noted, this book isn't designed as an introduction to programming ASP.NET-you're expected to have written pages in it before.  I personally would have preferred to see the examples provided in the book in C# (rather than VB.NET), but that's a minor issue, and any experienced ASP.NET developer already has some practice translating between the two.  This book is a must read if you're planning on migrating to the new version of the .NET framework. <br />	2005-07-02

If you struggle with the ethics of spying, then don't even bother picking up this book.  If you're past that and just want to find out what someone is doing online, or if you want a better understanding of what it takes to spy, then you're in for a treat.   <br /> <br />After a brief introduction chapter, and even an ethics discussion, the book dives headfirst into the subject.  You can really spy on someone through two different methods: 1) Login to their computer and see what they're doing or 2) Get onto their network and sniff their traffic.  Both types of spying require different types of skills.  Both types of skills are covered in some depth in this book. <br /> <br />Logging onto the victim's computer (usually a spouse) can usually be done.  What is hard is covering your tracks.  This book discusses ways to hide what you do, what to look for, how to spy on email, IM conversations, browser history, etc.  There is also a very good discussion on keystroke capture devices and software.   <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book was under the \\"Advanced Techniques\\" section, where the author shows how to perform an ARP spoofing attack.  This is a type of attack where you can trick a switch into sending packets to you (from the person you're spying on) that you normally wouldn't see.   <br /> <br />Deciding to spy on someone's internet activities is a pretty serious decision.  If you're serious about doing it, and doing it right, then you must read this book.  If you're not into spying on others, but want to know ways you could be spyed on, then you'll want to read this book too.  It will open your eyes. <br />	2005-07-02

I think it's safe to say that this is the first design patters book I've read that hasn't immediately put me to sleep.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely believe in the concept of design patterns.  It's just that most of the books that talk about them are so unbelievably dull, that it's hard to not to fall asleep.  This book does an amazing job of discussing design patterns, but managed to talk about it in a way that actually made me want to continue reading. <br /> <br />The book starts off with probably the best explanation I have read about the difference between inheritance and interfaces, and why to use one over the other.  The book proceeds to discuss such patterns as the Factory pattern, Singleton, the Command pattern, the Decorator pattern, the Observer pattern, and the Adaptor pattern to name a few.   <br /> <br />Be warned, this book may not be for everyone.  For example, if you're looking for a pattern reference book, you might want to avoid this one.  If you're looking for a good tutorial so that you can learn patterns for the first time, then this is probably the book you want.  Please also note that all examples are provided in Java, but it should be fairly straightforward to translate most of these into your target language. <br /> <br />The workbook style of this book as well as the informal writing make this an excellent book to use to learn what patterns are, how to use them, and why you should even care.  I would  highly recommend this book to someone falling into this category. <br />	2005-03-16

This book really covers everything that has to do with a home theater: from selecting the right components, to component configuration, to cabling, to making your theater look awesome.  This book is a must read before you start your home theater. <br /> <br />The book begins with a very thorough and impressive discussion of how and where to buy home theater components.  The author discusses receivers (both audio and video), DVD players, TVs (both HD and standard), as well as the ins and outs of buying online versus at a local store.  This discussion naturally leads to a very large section on \\"configuration\\", which includes such things as how to install and configure a terrestrial television antenna, how to match your subwoofer to your room, and everything you ever wanted to know about cables.  I particularly enjoyed the author's discussion of the modern myth of expensive cabling.  He provides a very good explanation of what \\"good enough\\" means (you wouldn't put gold water pipes in your home, why spend $100 on a gold cable?).  <br /> <br />As mentioned, this is a very interesting and useful book for anyone planning or currently working on a home theater.  It dispelled a lot of myths I had heard in the past, and provides clear explanations as to why many of these myths are false.  Additionally, I found that the book provided sound advice in the purchase and configuration of home theater components. <br />	2005-03-16

What about moding your Xbox?  How about replacing the screen on your Game Boy?  This book will show you how to do all of these things and more.  All you need (aside from a couple of basic tools) is a strong stomach and an iron resolve to void your warranty.  In fact, having no fear is 90% of the work. <br /> <br />This book provides step-by-step instructions for a number of various \\"hacking\\" projects on a variety of consoles.  The majority of the hacks in this book deal with \\"retro\\" or \\"classic\\" systems, like the Atari series (2600, 5200, or 7800) as well as the Nintendo NES system.  Some of these hacks update these systems to work on modern televisions (like the addition of S-video to the 2600), but most are just for fun (like creating a left-hand Atari controller). <br /> <br />The hacks for modern consoles are also quite interesting, but most are concerned with the installation of a mod chip.  There is some interesting discussion about installing Linux on a Game Boy or Xbox.  The authors discuss how to boot a PS2 from a memory card, and other interesting items.  However, while these sections are very useful and quite interesting, there's nothing quite like dissecting an obsolete video game system. <br /> <br />This book even has an appendix dedicated to teaching the basics of electrical engineering.  There is also a great list of distributors for obsolete or hard-to-find components.  In fact, the appendix is so good that it alone makes this book worthwhile. <br /> <br />If you're ever going to take apart some electronic system, I would first suggest getting a book by these guys.  If that electronic system happens to be some game console, then this is the book for you.  These guys know what they're doing-they're the best.   <br />	2005-03-16

Smart homes-or home automation-has always seemed like something more from science fiction than science fact.  However, after reading this book, the truth is that creating a smart home is easier and far less technical than most people think.  This book provides the reader with 100 tips or things that can be done (some quite easy, some might take longer to complete) to automate your home. <br /> <br />Contrary to what you might think, much of what you can do with home automation doesn't require your home to be re-wired.  Instead, much of what you might want to accomplish (like having your computer automatically turning on or off lights in the house while you're on vacation) can be done very easily through X10 modules.  X10 modules are relatively inexpensive components which can send signals over power lines.  Once you understand X10, many of the more straightforward hacks in this book make a lot of sense. <br /> <br />Other projects you'll find in this book include a home monitoring system, a smart sprinkling system, sending messages of what's happening at home to a cell phone or pager, and even controlling your home from a web browser.  While some of these projects may sound a bit Orwellian, they are actually very interesting and can make your home a safer place to live.  Instead of becoming a victim when a toilet or washing machine overflows, you can put preemptive measures in place to be alerted before a problem occurs. <br /> <br />This is a very interesting book and a must read if you've ever considered home automation.  Not only will this book step you through some projects, but it will give you some excellent ideas for the future.  I enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it. <br />	2005-03-16

How do they do that?  What did the original photograph look like?  This book takes you through eight different photographs to demonstrate what each artist did to produce the final product.   <br /> <br />The \\"Designer Notebook\\" series from O'Reilly is really a great idea.  It allows a fly on the wall view of real professionals working on real projects.  You see some of their thought process, and the tools they use to produce the final result.  The photographs in this book cover a wide range of topics, which includes old photograph restoration, retouching for advertising, and even photojournalism.   <br /> <br />The book is short (less than 100 pages), and a few of the descriptions are a bit brief, but all in all, this is a fascinating look at real professionals creating real images.  You'll be inspired to follow along with some of your own photographs to see just what is possible with Photoshop. <br />	2005-03-16

I've had this book on my desk since the first edition.  Now at edition 3, this book just keeps getting better and better.  It covers virtually every XML standard, provides lots of examples, and has a character set reference that I couldn't live without.  Highly recommended for all XML questions. <br /> <br />Like many of the \\"Nutshell\\" books, this book starts off with a lot of informational chapters, designed to give a high level view of many XML-related technologies.  These chapters, while a bit vague in parts, are still very good and will answer most general questions.  However, when you have a deeper question, the reference chapters in the second half of the book really shine.  The reference material is well organized, making information easy to find and digest. <br /> <br />Personally, my favorite chapters are the XPath Reference and the XSLT Reference sections.   <br /> <br />Anyone who works with XML on a daily basis should have this book at their desk.  This is the one book to have on XML. <br />	2005-03-16

What I found was a book that goes through everything you need to know to go from a beginning ASP.NET developer to a really advanced developer.  I was very surprised with how complete and thorough this book is in helping developers become advanced ASP.NET developers. <br /> <br />This book assumes that you have some knowledge of ASP.NET.  The first chapter takes off immediately with a discussion on datagrids.  If you pick up this book without a basic knowledge of how to even create an ASPX page, you'll be lost.  If that is the case, go for one of O'Reilly's other ASP.NET books like Programming ASP.NET or ASP.NET In A Nutshell.  If you already have that groundwork, then you'll find this book to be a natural picking-up point. <br /> <br />After a very thorough discussion on tabular data (nearly 180 pages), the authors take the reader through data validation (with server validation controls), forms (which include tasks like getting the Enter key to work like the submit button), and user controls.  At this point, the book really starts to shine.  The authors begin a discussion of custom controls, which is both very interesting and very useful for the growing ASP.NET programmer.  The remainder of the book (which is still quite a bit of content), goes over such useful (and slightly more advanced) concepts like maintaining state, how and why to modify web.config, error handling, performance tuning, web services, and caching. <br /> <br />Like I mentioned, I was surprised at both the depth and breath of content covered in this book.  O'Reilly does list this book in their \\"cookbook\\" series and can certainly be used in that way.  However, I think many readers will find it quite easy and useful to read this book from cover to cover.  I would highly recommend this book for all levels of ASP.NET developers. The authors have done a very good job of including content that all levels of developer will benefit from. <br />	2005-03-16
US	49600352	RA5SWLMNFGMQT	0596006896	873884724	Unit Test Frameworks	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A must for test-first programmers	One of the major pushes in any agile methodology is that of test-first programming.  Test first programming requires the developer to write a programmatic unit test to test the functionality being created.  Unit Test frameworks have appeared to aid developers in this regard.  Basically, unit test frameworks allow programmers to create tests-written in their language of choice-for the piece of functionality created.  While test first programming might sound a bit backwards or like an added expense in an already busy project plan, it is in fact a priceless tool in quickly developing quality code.  This book outlines the major unit test frameworks available as well as how to go about using one of them. <br /> <br />Creating a unit test requires developers to think about their programming in a slightly different light.  This book does an excellent job in explaining what a unit test is, how to write it, and how to test what you really want to test.  The book then goes in depth to discuss the specific various frameworks, including JUnit, CppUnit, and NUnit (to name only a few).   <br /> <br />While giving some excellent instruction, this book also manages to include some good architecture lessons.  In one such example, the author discusses the disadvantage of tying UI to code and how that makes unit tests much more complicated to write and maintain.   <br /> <br />I was quite pleased with this book, and I would highly recommend it to any programmer.  Writing unit tests for your code during development will radically change how you program-for the better. <br />	2005-03-16

If you have a better understanding of how your computer performs mathematical computations, it might change how you write code for certain algorithms.  In any case, this book is one of the most comprehensive volumes in computer architecture that I have seen.   <br /> <br />Proceeding from most simple to most complex, the book begins by discussing how numbers are stored, and eventually moves (in the final chapter) to how I/O works.  I found the initial chapters most interesting, which included information on binary and hexadecimal numbers, how characters are stored in memory, how the computer handles various floating-point precisions, and how you would go about designing your own character types.  It's all basic computer science stuff, but fun to read either as a refresher or for the first time (in case you skipped that day of class). <br /> <br />Each chapter takes on a more complex aspect of the computer, moving from memory representations to CPU architecture.  Naturally a discussion about the CPU leads to information on CPU instruction sets.  Finally, the author wraps up the book with a discussion on I/O, which includes not just disk access, but the keyboard, USB, optical drives, and the file allocation table.   <br /> <br />My only complaint with this book is that I wish that with the impending move to 64-bit architecture, there was more information included in this regard.  However, in spite of that small omission, this is a really fascinating book to read.  As you write your next bit of code, if you think about what the computer is really doing under the covers, then I think this book has achieved its goal. <br />	2005-03-16

The book starts out with an introduction to emulation and MAME, which allows you to play old console games (like the Atari 2600) or arcade games on a PC.  The author even provides directions to illustrate how you can take an old Atari 2600 paddle controller and hook it into your PC (with a soddering iron and a little work).  Any gamer who ever played on the Atari would love something like this. <br /> <br />In my favorite chapter, the author shows how to maximize portable devices for gaming fun.  In one hack, the author shows how to play games on your iPod.  In another hack, the author shows how to produce color pictures from the Game Boy's black and white camera attachment.  There are even instructions for turning your PocketPC or PalmPilot into a Game Boy or even a Commordore 64.   <br /> <br />The author has a section dedicated to creating the best game machine, where he discusses video cards, mice, and other peripherals.  In other sections, the author discusses how to modify your gaming console, including Xbox mods, tunneling (e.g. making games play online that weren't designed to be played online), and other game hacks.  Finally, the author rounds out the discussion by demonstrating how to create and add a vehicle to Unreal Tournament 2004.  While it does require a bit of time and some work, I was surprised at how relatively easy the whole process was. <br /> <br />This is a great book to read if you enjoy gaming-regardless of whether they're games from 20 years ago or brand new.  This book will help you to get the most out of your gaming experience and have a lot of fun doing it. <br />	2005-03-16

This book reminded me a little bit of O'Reilly's other book \\"Smart Home Hacks\\", only the hacks in this book are not all specifically smart-home related.  In any case, some of the hacks in the other book mentioned are also found in this book.  \\"Home Hacking Projects\\", however, does contain some fun projects I haven't seen anywhere else. <br /> <br />Some of the more interesting projects in this book include how to remotely monitor your pet, creating time shifted radio, and how to make your home talk.  One thing I really enjoyed about this book is that examples are provided for both a Linux and Windows environment.  Additionally, configuration information is provided for your router, if the completed project is to be accessible from outside your home network. <br /> <br />While there are some projects included in this book that you might find elsewhere, this book does an excellent job of providing clear and detailed instructions, including wiring diagrams (if applicable), screen shots of configuration information, and a lot of other things that make the successful completion of these projects much more likely.  You'll have a blast automating your home with this book. <br />	2005-03-16

While I always felt like I should be investing too, it was never clear to me how to begin this process.  After all, it's my money.  How can I be sure I'm investing in something that will provide some sort of reasonable return?  This book is an excellent resource in answering some of those questions and putting the new investor on the right track. <br /> <br />This book is written in the same format as the other \\"hacks\\" series by O'Reilly.  This format is very easy to read, and the format makes it very easy to find answers.  Rather then having to read the book from cover to cover, the reader can pick out topics they are dealing with, read the answer, and move on.  Since many of the people interesting in a book of this nature will likely have little time, the book's format works to its advantage. <br /> <br />The book begins with some basic introduction to the stock market and tips for selecting appropriate stocks or mutual funds.  The whole middle section of the book deals with data analysis.  The author discusses how to understand a company's balance sheet (e.g. what that P/E ratio means), how to spot companies in financial trouble, how to pick a good stock, and even how to trade.  There is also a good discussion on minimizing the effect of taxes on your little return on investment. <br /> <br />The author even goes further and gets into a discussion on financial planning.  In addition to discussing debt reduction, the author also talks about IRA plans and different strategies for saving for your child's education expenses.  I think my favorite part of this book was the discussion on different education savings plans.  The author discusses the ins and outs (as well as tax consequences) of each of the plans, and provides some examples illustrating the fact that it's better to start saving earlier than later. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, not just for its investing advice, but also forits sound financial planning.  This is a great book for anyone who is interested in increasing their wealth, saving for a rainy day, or simply saving for future financial goals. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-03

Inexperienced SQL developers will probably get more out of Oracle Press' other excellent book PL/SQL 101. <br /> <br />This book begins exactly the way experienced developers would expect-it starts out at a running pace.  The book takes the next hundred-or-so pages just discussing PL/SQL basics.  Where this book excels is in its examples.  Each and every PL/SQL principle is clearly illustrated with many clear and relevant examples.  The author then begins into a discussion of advanced PL/SQL techniques, which includes a discussion of cursors, built-in functions, and records. <br /> <br />The middle section of the book covers management and syntax of Oracle packages and functions.  This excellent discussion covers such issues as package scope and permissions.  This discussion naturally leads into advanced PL/SQL techniques including transactions, pipes, and various built-in DBMS packages.  Finally, the book rounds out its PL/SQL discussions by reviewing use of Large Objects (LOB).  In this section, the author discusses use and retrieval of data in this format. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book to experienced Oracle or even non-Oracle developers who want to sharpen their PL/SQL skills or who are looking for a really good PL/SQL reference.  This is a must-have book for anyone serious about their PL/SQL development work. <br />	2004-10-03

The authors intend that reading this book will give IIS administrators the information they need to keep their networks secure, and hence keep their jobs.  This is the first CYA book I've read, and I was quite impressed by the nice balance between providing enough useful information without overkill.  The book is designed to get right to the point by showing (not telling) exactly what is required in securing an IIS 6 installation. <br /> <br />Each chapter is focused on a specific section of IIS security.  Chapters cover topics as varied as Basic IIS security, Advanced IIS security, monitoring, and general Server 2003 hardening.  Each chapter contains the some information on the Microsoft recommended procedure for the particular practice (what the authors call \\"By the Book\\").  Additionally, you will find many sections throughout the book labeled \\"Realty Check\\", which is designed to highlight how to either do something different from what Microsoft recommends or what some of the problems associated with the recommended procedure might be.  Finally, \\"Notes from the Underground\\" popup frequently, which help illustrate how hackers might utilize poor security around the illustrated practice in order to gain something. <br /> <br />I found the chapters to be well laid-out, easy to follow, and right to the point.  This book helped provide some real insight to various security practices around IIS, and was quite interesting to read as well.  This book is a must-have if you are responsible for monitoring or maintaining IIS 6 in your infrastructure.   <br /> <br />I am definitely looking forward to reading the next in the series of CYA books!	2004-10-03

They have consistently been written clearly, been relevant, and valuable in real-world Oracle development.  This book is of course no exception.  It is written as a beginning guide to not only Oracle development but as an entry-level text to SQL syntax and concepts as well.<br /><br />After a good introduction to what a database is, the author begins into a tutorial on basic SQL syntax.  In this introductory section, the reader learns how to create tables, write INSERT statements, and then select the data back out via the SELECT statement.  The author quickly moves to more advanced techniques, illustrating the use of the WHERE clause, and discusses use of the UPDATE statement.<br /><br />Practical use of the techniques just discussed will likely be implemented in SQL*Plus, so the author begins a very thorough discussion of this tool.  Many of the potential problems a user might experience with SQL*Plus are covered and solutions are provided.  I was quite pleased with how extensive this chapter covers the topic of SQL*Plus.  It is an excellent introduction to this tool.<br /><br />The author then begins to discuss more advanced database techniques, including the use of indexes and constraints.  Finally, the author begins a discussion of basic PL/SQL syntax.  This is really my only problem with the book: the book is called PL/SQL 101, yet only the last chapter is dedicated to discussing the subject.  Sure, the proceeding material is necessary to have the framework to discuss PL/SQL.  I just think the title is a bit misleading.	2004-10-03
US	49600352	R2DJ95GHE0WGZI	0072232161	108848469	Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services (Database)	Books	3	14	14	N	N	Good book, but could have been better	SQL Server reporting services are a relatively new feature of SQL Server 2000, so I was quite excited to pick up a copy of this book.  While this is a good beginning book for learning SQL and the basics of SQL Server reporting services, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in both the presentation and depth of content this book provides.  Again, this book provides some good explanation, however, the reader should be prepared for an introductory book, certainly not an advanced text.   <br /> <br />The first section of the book provides a very good introduction to SQL and SQL Server.  However, this is still very introductory information, and will only be useful for very beginning readers.  In fact, the author doesn't begin discussing the books topic until page 161.  Again, this introductory information is quite necessary to understand the rest of the text, I was just hoping for a more abbreviated version of the introductory material. <br /> <br />The rest of the book is actually much better and much more met my expectations.  The author then proceeds to discuss how to generate reports.  While much of the work involved in creating reports with SQL reporting services involves the use of a wizard, the author does a good job demonstrating how to expand reports beyond the default.  The last section of the book goes through many of the more advanced options found in reporting services.  There is a good discussion on exporting reports to different formats (including PDF, TIFF, and CSV).  The final two chapters of the book are excellent, which discuss such advanced options as configuring subscriptions for reporting services and ASP.NET Code Access Security (CAS). <br /> <br />This is really a good book, it's just not as advanced as I was hoping for.  While it's certainly a valuable resource for anyone working on SQL Server reporting services, it would have been preferable if the introductory content wasn't quite as extensive.  In spite of this complaint, I would stillrecommend it. <br />	2004-10-03

The book is organized into \\"ideas\\" which can help secure an ASP.NET (or really any) application.  Beneath each idea is a list of what type of threats the specific idea mitigates, followed by the actual ASP.NET implementation.  One thing I really liked about this book is that it's presented in a way which helps illustrate how hackers could infiltrate your web applications.  I found this to be very effective in driving home a security lesson. <br /> <br />The book is organized into ten different sections on aspects of ASP.NET security, which range from user management (which includes how to handle user names, passwords, and the like) to developing applications with security in mind (which includes issues like cross-site scripting attacks and error logging).  Many sites with user management features provide a \\"Secret Question\\", which is used in case you forget your password.  The secret questions often include questions like \\"What is the name of your favorite pet?\\" or \\"What city were you born in?\\".  The book goes on to show that the secret question concept goes against everything security experts have been saying by demonstrating how hackers can use brute-force attacks along with educated guesses to gain unauthorized access. <br /> <br />This book even discussed connection string issues and encryption in config files, which is an issue I am currently struggling with.  Code examples are provided for all of the ideas presented, which are generally quite clever in and of themselves. <br /> <br />If you are serious about improving the security in your ASP.NET applications, then do yourself a favor and read this book.  I think you will find it was time well-spent. <br />	2004-10-03

If you've ever looked at any of the books in O'Reilly's \\"Cookbook\\" series, you'll know that the book is organized into \\"recipes\\", which illustrate how to accomplish various development tasks in Java. <br /> <br />Many of the beginning recipes are pretty basic, but will be used by developers new to Java to get started.  Recipes include setting up the IDE to work correctly, working with a debugger, and even an introduction to JUnit.  The next few sections of recipes are similar to what you would expect from any \\"Learn to Program in Language\\" book.  There is a discussion on strings and string use, numbers, and date time values.   <br /> <br />As the book progresses, the recipes become increasingly technical.  I was quite impressed to see a discussion of Generics in chapter 8, which were added to 1.5.  Additional technical recipes include I/O, graphics and sound, and using sockets in Java.  The author is able to successfully discuss a lot of different topics in a very clear and concise way.  Additionally, I was both pleased and surprised to see the author include brief discussions on software patterns and agile methodologies, both of which are very much coming into vogue. <br /> <br />Naturally, this book isn't easy to read from cover to cover, but it was never designed that way.  Much like an actual cookbook, it is designed to best be used as a reference manual.  Experienced non-Java programmers will benefit from this book, which can be used as a good tutorial to learn the Java language quickly.  Java programmers will also benefit greatly from this book, and will likely want to have it next to their computer as a reference manual.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone either wanting to learn Java or anyone looking for a good Java reference book. <br />	2004-10-03

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to really understand the PDF format and know exactly what can be done with this format.  Like the many other excellent O'Reilly \\"hacks\\" series, this book provides 100 different tips and tricks that can be used in dealing with the PDF format.  Some of these hacks involve creating your own PDFs through third-party tools, others include tips on modifying PDFs after they have been created. <br /> <br />PDF Hacks are divided into four main sections: consuming, managing, authoring, and manipulating PDFs.  Some of the hacks are quite interesting and cover things you might not otherwise think of.  Once interesting hack is #25, \\"Convey Your Document's Value with Good Design\\".  This hack actually discusses different issues with fonts including various typography tips and alignment issues.  This is certainly an issue I think of rarely, but this hack shows some of the reasons to really think through this issue.  There are many such hacks which are quite enlightening. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book was toward the end, where the author discusses the tool \\"pdftk\\", which can be used to freely modify PDF files.  The author proceeds to show how this tool can be used to change text within exiting PDF files without significant work.  While this hack might not be used by everyone, it illustrates the type of advanced tips this book provides. <br /> <br />Like I said at the beginning of this review, I just wish I had read this book three months ago.  After reading this book, the reader will have a much better understanding of the PDF format, as well as having a knowledge of the tools that can be used to extend the PDF format beyond what you might have initially thought possible.  If you want to understand the PDF format and what information on how to \\"hack\\" your PDFs, then you need a copy of this book! <br />	2004-10-03

Each book contains 100 or so tips on the subject of the book.  Depending on the subject matter, some of these are actual hacks, while others are simply really cool tips.  Like the other \\"Hacks\\" book, this one is not only fun to read but very well worth the tips it provides.<br />In what I found to be a very welcome step, the authors have provided only a few Photoshop hacks.  Instead they have opted to concentrate on the many various other issues involved in digital photography.  Some of the hacks you might find interesting include how to un-erase an erased CF card, how to use various filters and gels to make photos with impact, and how to use your iPod to store your photographs.  While there are a couple of hacks involving Photoshop, they are totally appropriate for this type of book (which include tips for resampling and sharpening) and are not simply a rehash of what you might read in other digital photography books.<br />The hack I most enjoyed reading was #25 (Painless Infrared Photography).  Having done a fair amount of traditional infrared photography (it's a pain), I was pleased to read just how easy it is to do with a digital camera.  Some other hacks I enjoyed include #74 (Hand Color with the History Brush) and #55 (Virtual-Reality Movies from Your Digicam).  <br />This is a really fun book to read and has a lot of very useful and interesting digital photography information that I haven't seen in other books.  This is definitely a book that digital photography enthusiasts and traditional photographers who are turning to digital will enjoy.	2004-06-06

While this book goes into some of these topics, it goes a step further by looking at it from the point of view of a professional photographer.  This insight is particularly welcome, which shifts the focus of the book from knowing how to use Photoshop to how to be a better photographer.<br />The author takes the professional photographer's perspective (although this book can really be read and enjoyed by anyone serious about digital photography), which includes discussing issues such as storage, cataloging, CCD basics, and software.  The author discusses some of his file naming techniques, shows some of the tools he uses, and provides recommendations for camera purchases.<br />Rather than simply rehashing the same Photoshop tricks available in every other digital photography book, the author shows what professional photographers do (bracketing photographs) as well as different software that might be better suited for a specific task (stitching software to combine many individual photographs into one large image).  Naturally, many other image manipulations are discussed, however, the central point of the discussions are always how to make a better photograph.  I found discussions that focused on the photograph rather than the software tool very refreshing and quite interesting and useful.<br />The author wraps up the book by providing some ideas on how to break into the business as a professional photographer.  There is a discussion on printing photographs and how to create some beginning marketing materials.  In all of these discussions, the focus remains on the photograph.  I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to individuals interested in a book that gives you more than the rest of the digital photography books out there.	2004-06-06

Designed as a crash-course in everything one would need to know to effectively maintain and develop for an Oracle database, this book does a good job to quickly get the reader in control of this potentially complex data system.<br />After a brief introduction to Oracle data types and the basic environment (like tables, views, and indexes), the authors present a fairly detailed section on writing data queries.  While much in this section can be applied to some of the more recent versions of Oracle, it is targeted to the 10g platform.  The reader interested in this section will also likely want to read Chapter 6, which focuses on writing PL/SQL.<br />For the aspiring database administrator, there are some very good sections on what an Oracle DBA should do.  While simply reading these sections won't make you a DBA, they contain a lot of good information including discussions on networking issues and disaster recovery.<br />The rest of the book contains a lot of information on Oracle features, which can be used by both database developers and DBAs.  Examples include Oracle's use of XML and Java, as well as database maintenance issues for supporting large datasets.<br />This is a great beginner's book to Oracle 10g, as it includes just enough information to be useful, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming.  This is definitely a good book to pick up if you are new to Oracle or the 10g platform.	2004-05-21

Like his articles, this book is designed to help the reader get the most out of the Oracle database.  This is an excellent book for understanding the inner workings of Oracle database engine.<br />The theme of this book is that by understanding how Oracle works, you can write highly scalable, high performing applications.  If you don't know how your database works, you'll always be frustrated and less likely to have a well-performing database.  The author is absolutely serious about this point and drives it home by dispelling many myths surrounding Oracle (e.g. partitioning is always better than not partitioning).  By discussing these technical details, the reader is equipped with the knowledge to build an application designed to perform.<br />If you're looking for a book to learn how to write effective PL/SQL, then you might be slightly disappointed by this book.  While there is a great chapter on the Oracle specifics of writing SQL, this book is designed to architecting the entire database, not just the SQL statements run inside the database.  I think this a very effective (and sadly novel) approach to database design.  There are all too many books out there which concentrate on writing fast SQL, with little regard for the underlying data design and structure.<br />This is by far the best book I have read on understanding how Oracle works.  The author covers everything from design to disaster recovery.  If you are responsible for maintaining an Oracle database, I would highly recommend this book.	2004-05-21

If you have a Pocket PC, you're probably always looking for cool new programs to run on it.  If you're that kind of person, then you'll really enjoy this book.  The authors have compiled a list (along with descriptions, prices, and screenshots) of various Pocket PC applications that are really cool.  Included in the book is a CD-ROM containing trial versions of many of the programs they discuss.<br />These programs are divided up into nine sections: programs for work, travel, multimedia, games, utilities, learning, web, money management, and the authors' favorites.  All in all, they've found some really interesting programs.  Plus with most of them available on the included CD, you can try them out before buying them.<br />I think my favorite program discussed in this book is Mapopolis, which is one of the great Pocket PC mapping programs available (think MapQuest in a Pocket PC).  Other great programs include Pocket Stars (obviously for astronomy), eXPerience (a Windows XP-like skin for your Pocket PC), and Total Remote (which allows you to control your TV from your Pocket PC).<br />This book is a lot of fun to read, and highly enjoyable by any Pocket PC enthusiast.

This edition has been updated to include information on the 1.1 version of the .NET framework as well as Visual Studio 2003.<br />Unlike many other ASP.NET books I have seen, you can actually pick this one up and begin writing ASP.NET applications quickly.  The book begins with an introduction to the Visual Studio development environment, which is necessary knowledge to be able to effectively write and compile code.  This introduction does a very good job quickly describing the most important features of the IDE.  For a more thorough introduction to the Visual Studio .NET IDE, pick up a copy of O'Reilly's Mastering Visual Studio .NET.<br />This book then proceeds to discuss each of the ASP.NET server controls in detail.  Examples are provided in both C# and VB.NET, with clear preference given to C#.  Some of the more difficult concepts are clearly explained, with enough information provide to satisfy more advanced readers.<br />Personally, I found many of the highlights of this book to be toward the end, where an excellent section on data access can be found.  This has often been a point of contention with me: most applications today have some amount of data access involved.  Unfortunately, most .NET books have only a small (and largely inadequate) data access chapter.  The data access section in this book is one of the best I have seen.  Even if you know a lot about ASP.NET, you'll probably learn a thing or two from the data access section.  <br />The authors also have written an excellent chapter on creating custom controls for applications.  There is a very good discussion on creating user controls and custom controls (both of which can be used as re-usable components in web applications).<br />Like the previous edition, this book doesn't disappoint.  This is a must have for ASP.NET developers and an excellent tutorial for individuals trying to get their hands around ASP.NET.	2004-05-21

If you have a Pocket PC, you're probably always looking for cool new programs to run on it.  If you're that kind of person, then you'll really enjoy this book.  The authors have compiled a list (along with descriptions, prices, and screenshots) of various Pocket PC applications that are really cool.  Included in the book is a CD-ROM containing trial versions of many of the programs they discuss.<br />These programs are divided up into nine sections: programs for work, travel, multimedia, games, utilities, learning, web, money management, and the authors' favorites.  All in all, they've found some really interesting programs.  Plus with most of them available on the included CD, you can try them out before buying them.<br />I think my favorite program discussed in this book is Mapopolis, which is one of the great Pocket PC mapping programs available (think MapQuest in a Pocket PC).  Other great programs include Pocket Stars (obviously for astronomy), eXPerience (a Windows XP-like skin for your Pocket PC), and Total Remote (which allows you to control your TV from your Pocket PC).<br />This book is a lot of fun to read, and highly enjoyable by any Pocket PC enthusiast.  I'd recommend picking it up and seeing what your Pocket PC can do!	2004-05-21
US	49600352	RSWP6BWWW1OF0	0596003390	300626156	C# Cookbook	Books	4	27	29	N	N	Great addition to your C# library	This is a really cool book.  Skim through it, and you'll see that all the hard stuff you want to do in .NET or C# are all in one book.  You'll find some general computer science algorithms implemented in C#, and you'll find other things that are simply C# specific.  I'd highly recommend any professional C# programmer adding this to their reference library.<br />The book contains a chapter for each of various C# objects.  Beginning with numbers, the book continues through strings, classes, delegates, collections, I/O, threading, and XML to name a few.  Some examples of \\"recipes\\" you'll find include how to improve string builder performance, issues with bit-shifting, adding notification callbacks, rolling back object changes, determining whether a process has stopped responding, and validating XML.<br />Like many of O'Reilly's other \\"cookbook\\" reference books, this book can be read from cover to cover, but it's really designed like a cookbook.  The idea is to flip thorough each recipe in a specific section until you find one that fits what you're trying to do.  While reading through this book, I came across five or six answers to various different problems I'm currently addressing in my own C# work.  This is a definite must-have to your library.	2004-04-22

The purpose of this book is to get the reader to the point where they know enough about databases that they can perform specific database tasks (e.g. query a table, create a new table, understand an ERD).  I think actually, that this book succeeds in achieving this goal.  While the reader certainly shouldn't expect to be a DBA once complete, they should expect to be able to begin performing certain basic database tasks.  In fact, they should have enough knowledge that they'll know where to go for more advanced help.<br />This book begins with a basic introduction to the various types of databases, explaining the rationale for each, before explaining why this book concentrates on relational databases.  After the required introduction to querying data in Microsoft Access, the book really starts to get good.  The introduction to SQL is very good with examples provided in SQL*Plus.<br />The reader is then taken through a discussion of database design.  This discussion goes through the differences between various normal forms (especially the more common first through third normal forms).  Next, the reader learns how to read an interpret ERD diagrams.  Finally, there is a good discussion on how to actually design a database, with discussion on different kinds of constraints and keys. <br />The last section of the book touches on some of the more complex aspects of database design and maintenance, including security, transaction support, and basic tuning.<br />I think this is an excellent introduction to common database practices and procedures.  Again, the reader shouldn't expect to be an advanced Oracle developer simply by reading this book, however, the reader should expect to know enough to complete basic database development tasks.  It's a great way to start.	2004-04-22

This is a really cool book, a very interesting read, and a primer in basic electronics.  It covers topics as varied as how to install a bigger hard drive in your iPod, how to add more memory to your PalmPilot, and how to build your own media center PC.  But the book gets into some really interesting modifications, like re-housing your old Macintosh into an entirely Lego case, updating the audio and video outputs of your Atari 2600 system, and how to make your Atari 7800 play 2600 games.  <br />Since you're dealing with sensitive electronics, which damage very easily, the theme carried through this book is \\"do not have fear\\".  Once you overcome any fear about damaging any of your equipment, these hacks become very entertaining and a good way to pass the time.  Moreover, if your hack is actually successful, you've got something to brag about to your buddies.  What's more, the various hacks covered will provide the skill to move to increasingly complex projects.<br />The book begins with a very useful introduction to basic electronics.  You learn the difference between capacitors, transistors, resistors, etc.  The chapter then proceeds to discuss the basics of soldering and other electronics basics.  <br />This is a very fun book to read, and it contains a lot of fun projects.  If you like taking things apart and have no fear, this is a book you certainly want to get your hands on.	2004-04-22
US	49600352	RAVJTWRQSM1CA	0596005458	412770136	Security Warrior: Know Your Enemy	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Eye-opening	The whole concept of this book is: know your enemy.  If you are a software developer or systems administrator, something you touch is bound to be attacked.  Software developers need to understand this when writing programs.  Likewise, systems administrators must protect their system from outside attack.  This book proceeds from the premise that attack is inevitable, but we are more effective in dealing with it if we know the tactics of hackers.  As we understand how they think and act, it helps us write and maintain a higher level of security within applications or network infrastructure.<br />This book is very interesting to read and amazing to see how easy it is to \\"hack\\" various kinds of applications with just a few tools.  The book discusses the basics of reverse engineering on Windows, Linux, and Pocket PC.  Additionally, the authors step through a couple of examples, to show just how easy it is to bypass entering a serial number in a software install.  Other \\"hacks\\" shows include buffer overflow, TCP/IP, SQL injection attacks, and even social engineering.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in any kind of software or network security.  It is very eye-opening to see just how easy it is to compromise a system.  Once you know how your enemy attacks, you can proceed with ways to combat them.	2004-04-22

I like the series because I can go to the \\"cookbook\\" subject I'm having trouble with, leaf through a few pages, and see an answer to a problem that is similar to my own.  The XSLT Cookbook is very similar in structure to the other \\"cookbooks\\", but with an XSLT flavor.  <br />After going through the various recipes in this book, I can honestly say that I am amazed at the kind of things you can do with just XSLT.  You can do more than just reformat XML to look nice on an HTML page-you can even use it to calculate statistical functions!  Even if you're not planning on calculating a combinatoric, just looking through some of these patterns will make you a better XSLT programmer.<br />One nice thing this book provides beyond the recipes is a discussion on how to extend XSLT via SAXON or Java.  There is also discussion on how to use XSLT via Perl or Java.<br />I was very impressed by the amount of time and thought that was put into the creation of many of these recipes-not only are many of them really, really hard to do, but they're also things I've seen a real need for in the real world.  XSLT programmers, do yourself a favor and take a look through this book before you hurt your brain with your next assignment.	2004-02-07

If I already have a graphic and I need to change the color or make the background transparent, then I am okay.  But I've always wondered how people can make some of the really creative stuff that Photoshop can do.  I've never been able to figure out how to do some of the effects that you see in virtually every advertisement in the Sunday paper.<br />This book goes a long way toward showing you how to do a lot of those really cool effects.  It's written for someone with a basic understanding of Photoshop, so you won't have to go through the boring details of what Photoshop is.  The book is divided up into different sections, with each chapter in a section being dedicated to a particular \\"project\\" (e.g. how to create a DVD package).  The great thing about each project is that this book contained step-by-step instructions along with lots and lots of screen captures.<br />Another thing which makes this book really fun to use is that many of the projects involve creating a graphic or logo you see all the time (like the UPN Television logo, a Best Buy advertisement, or an EA Sports game cover).  These little added bits of realism help make the book a lot of fun as well as help you see different examples of where you can use your Photoshop skills.<br />If you're like me-a casual Photoshop user who wants to become a lot better-then this might be a fun book to take a look at.  It shows how to make really professional looking graphics, and helps you see that it's really not that far out of your reach!	2004-02-07

When performing a query with ADO.NET, it's as easy to return the results as a DataSet as it is to return it as XML.  This book realizes the core use of XML to .NET and discusses many of the various options developers have in handling XML.<br />The book covers a few main points: how to read XML, how to write XML, how to transform XML (via XSLT), and various data manipulations.  Each of these points, in turn, opens up various different issues which are discussed at length (like constraining XML via an XSD or how to read a non-XML document into XML).  Much of the discussion contained some of the best instruction related to XML and .NET that I have seen.  The final section of the book contains various reference chapters related to the XML namespaces (think of the reference section in the Nutshell series and you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect).  <br />All in all, this is a very well written and well thought out discussion on the uses of XML in .NET.  Not only will this book further your understanding of how to use .NET and XML together, but it will also help you gain insight into perhaps new uses for XML in your applications.  I would recommend looking through this book before you begin your next .NET application.	2004-02-07

They serve as a great introduction to various topics, and their newest JavaScript book is no exception.  If I were to learn JavaScript all over again, this is the book I would want to have helping me along the way.<br />This book starts out at the very beginning-it assumes you don't know anything about JavaScript, variables, or functions and goes through what each of those are.  After a good introduction into basic programming via JavaScript, there is a thorough discussion on each of the arithmetic and comparison operators in JavaScript.  The rest of the book gets into the nitty-gritty of writing web pages with JavaScript by going over conditional statements, event handlers, and the DOM.<br />Through this discussion, you learn how to use JavaScript with HTML forms, frames, arrays, how to handle various types of data (e.g. string vs. date time), and even learn how to use JavaScript for image rollovers-the most basic of DHTML.  Really this book covers the basics.  If you go through this book and really understand it, you'll understand the critical skills you'll need to effectively use JavaScript.  I would highly recommend this book to someone who doesn't know anything about JavaScript and needs a place to begin.	2004-02-07

If you don't have TechTV, then let me explain.  The TV show \\"The Screen Savers\\" discusses various tips, tricks, and tools for improving your computing experience.  This book is really just a collection of some of the best tips and tricks, which has been put into a tip of the day format.<br />Some of the tips you might expect include what you should look for in a DVD player, information about the CD-ROM burning tool \\"Alcohol 120%\\", and where you can get star charts for your PDA.  While \\"The Screen Savers\\" always has something interesting to discuss, what makes this book great is that it's all written down.  Rather than hearing about something cool on TV and forgetting about it a few minutes later, you can refer back to something you read earlier.<br />This was a surprisingly interesting and useful book.  It was very entertaining to read and I was able to even use some of the tips!  While it's definitely not a reference book, it is a fun book to have alongside the computer.	2003-12-07

In addition to discussing some of the reasons behind certain security schemes, the theory is explained as well as the C# implementation.  While there are some .NET specific security issues discussed (e.g. configuring worker processes), the section on cryptography should be required reading for everyone in the computer industry.<br />I get really excited about a book when it contains a lot of good information and I am able to actually use it to solve real-world problems.  After reading this book, I was able to help solve a really tricky (and politically challenging) security issue quite quickly.  If you have anything to do with your company's security systems or write any .NET code, I think this book deserves a place in your reference section.  This is certainly the best book on .NET security I have read thus far.	2003-12-07

Some people criticize the Nutshell series over this issue, but it is really the strong point of this book-it is designed to be used as a desktop reference.  I have always liked the Nutshell book, and this one is no exception.<br />Again, this book isn't designed to be a how-to, and O'Reilly doesn't claim it as such.  It's designed as a desktop reference, which is really where this book shines.  Java web service developers will find this a valuable addition to their library.	2003-12-07
US	49600352	R5VMZWVME80HA	0596003447	848973537	Learning UML	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good introductory book	Learning UML is O'Reilly's entry-level book into the world of UML.  It is a good introduction to UML modeling concepts and diagrams.  Rather than overwhelm the reader with various types of diagrams, the book takes the approach that UML diagrams consist of \\"words\\" (symbols) that make up \\"sentences\\" (diagrams).  This is an effective technique, as it teaches the reader to understand how one small symbol can affect the overall meaning of the diagram.<br />One of the things I really like about this book is how it builds from simple to complex examples.  This is done in such a way that the reader can quickly understand the more complex example, which is useful in understand many real-world UML diagrams.	2003-12-07

It is designed to help PocketPC users understand just what they can do with their really expensive toy.  While it's probably not a good book for techies, since they will probably be able to figure out everything they're PocketPC can do pretty quickly anyway, it is good for everyone else.<br />The book starts out pretty much how you would expect it: with a section on how to synch your PocketPC and other introductory steps.  Once you've got it synched, there is a discussion on personalization features of the PocketPC.  The book then goes through each of the types of things you can do with a PocketPC: make contacts and manage appointments, use PocketPC versions of Excel and Word, call someone on the phone (if you're lucky enough to have the PocketPC Phone Edition), take notes, access multimedia content, use mapping software, and even instant message.	2003-12-07

Building a smart home is actually a pretty easy process, especially with a lot of the equipment which is currently available.  The whole point of having a smart home is being able to control every aspect of your house regardless of where you are-be it in the next room or across the world.<br />Several sections are dedicated to designing, installing, and programming a home security system.  This not only includes installing motion detectors, but also configuring your heating and cooling system to be remotely programmed, as well as your lights.  Additional chapters cover projects for your garage and outside, kitchen and bathroom (how about a stove that shuts itself automatically when you forget or a toilet that is smart enough not to overflow), and even audio/visual systems and distribution mechanisms.<br />While smart homes may not be for everyone, there are a lot of cool ideas in this book.  If you know (or are) someone who is interested in the idea of a smart home, you should definitely pick up a copy of this book.  You'll find a lot of cool ideas as well as good advice for making your first smart home enhancements.	2003-12-07

The Pocket Reference is all about usability, and this book is no exception.  If you've never seen Mastering Regular Expressions, then this book takes the most important aspects of that book into about 80 pages.<br />This book is basically divided into various languages (Perl, C, Java, C#) with examples on how to use regular expressions with each language.  In addition to discussing the built-in language specific functions that you should use, there is discussion on the differences and nuances to using regular expressions in the specific language.<br />If you need a desktop quick reference on regular expressions, then I would highly recommend this book.  I have it next to my desk with the .NET section bookmarked.  If you need something with a little more depth and explanation, then I would suggest picking up a copy of O'Reilly's Mastering Regular Expressions.	2003-12-07

It is really useful for people with knowledge of UML but need a quick refresher.  <br />I found it to not only be a very quick read, but a good reference on UML syntax and usage.  The book is divided up into sections, which cover the various UML diagrams you might encounter.  The brief discussion in each section will quickly bring the reader up to speed.<br />Again, if you are already familiar with UML and need a sort of quick reference book, then I would recommend this as an addition to your library.  If you are looking for a more thorough UML explanation or are not as comfortable with it as you would like to be, I would recommend a more involved book, like O'Reilly's Learning UML.	2003-12-07

While all of the material is covered in O'Reilly's other books, I was impressed with the layout and presentation of this book.  I also found that the reference material that is buried deep in O'Reilly's other books, was very easy to find in this one.  I was especially impressed with the JavaScript and HTTP reference, and feel that these two sections will be used by the majority of this book's readers.	2003-07-06

While DBAs will find the appendices an invaluable resource (which cover topics as diverse as column type and function reference to the MySQL API), beginning developers will find the most use out of the more \\"instructional\\" chapters.  This book is written for a very large audience, and appears to succeed in this area.<br />The book is divided up into four sections: general use, API, administration, and the appendices (or everything else).  The general use section is really geared for new MySQL developers.  In this section, the basics of querying data, some of the nuances of MySQL, as well as query optimization are discussed.  <br />I was especially impressed by the appendices, which consisted of about 1/3 of the book.  In the appendices, you will find a complete MySQL data type reference as well as various built in functions.	2003-07-06

Quite to my surprise, this book was both easy and fun to read.  While serious XP users will be familiar with many of the tips out lined in the book, there is a section on advanced tips (most of which are registry hacks), which are quite interesting.<br />The book consists of several hundred tips relating directly to the use and look of your Windows XP OS.  Almost every tip takes up a fourth of the page, and consists of a description of the tip as well as an appropriate screen shot.  The book actually reads like a cookbook, which is great for this type of book.  Simply flip to the section you are interested in, and browse the title of each tip until you find the one you want.  <br />The tips range from registry hacks (pretty much changing the behavior of Windows), to information on working with Media Player, tips on searching, XP annoyances, and general information on getting the most from your computer.  Some of the easier tips include how to arrange or customize your toolbar, adding quick launch icons, and changing an file's icon.  Some intermediate tips include adding a short cut icon to shut down or switch users, and how to use some of Windows XP's hidden programs.  More advanced tips range from tricks you can do to annoy your co-workers (hide all desktop icons, switch the right and left mouse buttons, etc.) to how to make the label of \\"My Computer\\" be dynamic based on who is logged in.<br />This book is written for beginning to intermediate Windows XP users.  The tips and tricks contained in this book will be very valuable to this audience.  The book was easy to read and easy to find information.	2003-07-06

If you have previous experience with C, C++, or even C#, you will have little problem dissecting this book.<br />The organization is one thing I really did like about this book.  If you know you will do a lot with servlets but little with Swing, you can skip the section on UI and concentrate on the web section.  <br />I found this to be a through and well written introduction to Java for the experienced programmer.  This book should cover most new developer's Java needs, through understanding the language to writing applications, to even understanding JavaBeans.	2003-07-06

There is enough detail and background on Flash to help programmers (with little to no Flash experience) as well as experienced Flash developers understand and write ActionScript.  <br />As with most books, the first couple of chapters are designed to get readers with various backgrounds to reach the same level of understanding as quickly as possible.  Again, there is enough detail and background on Flash that individuals with little experience can get up to speed quickly.  Additionally, there is enough basic programming information, that designers who want to learn how to program Flash can learn the jargon and be able to read code.  In this discussion, the reader is introduced to arrays and objects in ActionScript in addition to learning how to create your own objects.<br />Advanced developers will be pleased to find a section entitled \\"Interfacing with External Data\\".  In this section, the reader learns how to access data via HTTP GET and how to work with XML.  This section will be well read by programmers who need Flash to integrate with existing business data and infrastructure.<br />The biggest surprise (and most welcome addition) to this book was the approximately 200 pages of \\"Workshop\\" material.  In the book's workshop, the reader is presented with exercises to complete with step-by-step detail.  I found the format to be similar to Microsoft's Step-By-Step books.  The workshop section of this book is a great addition and pushed the book from the category of \\"good buy\\" to \\"must have\\".	2003-07-06

I found this to be a great book which fulfills its purpose.  The book provides a short section on a specific topic (e.g. \\"Representing Objects as Strings\\") and after a little theory, provides the specific steps to perform the task.  Sometimes these steps are elements of code the reader needs to type, other times instructions are provided for the Visual Studio .NET IDE.  Code examples are provided throughout the book, with relevant lines or snippets highlighted in red.  This formatting allows the reader to easily see the author's point.<br />After reading this book, the reader should be familiar with Microsoft's .NET initiative as well as have an understanding of the C# syntax.  Additionally, the reader should have a good understanding of OO programming after reading this book.  Furthermore, through reading this book, the reader will learn the basics of inheritance, interfaces, delegates and event handling, error handling, reflection, as well as web services.<br />If you're an experienced Java or C++ developer, you may want to find a more advanced book.  However, if you are new to OO programming or .NET, then you should definitely pick up this book.	2003-07-06
US	49600352	RFT9P5DG699HH	0072224207	646860761	Java 2: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Both a learning aid and a reference book	I have always enjoyed Osborne's \\"Complete Reference\\" series, and this book is no exception.  Designed as both a learning aid and a reference book, I found that material was both easy to lookup and the text was engaging enough to read through.<br />The book starts out with an overview of Java, including a discussion of OOP.  If you're an experienced OO Programmer, you'll probably be a bit bored.  Really the first 6 chapters cover all the basics of creating a Java program (including data types, operators, classes, and control statements).  After this initial discussion, the book gets a bit more complicated by diving into inheritance, threads, and I/O.  <br />What I really enjoyed about this book is the rest of it: after this discussion on Java language principles, the rest of the book is a how-to on the various Java libraries.  For example, in the chapter on the java.util library, there is a section on the HashSet class.  There is a description of the class (including various overloaded constructors) and a good example of how to use it.  Think O'Reilly's Java In A Nutshell but with a lot more instruction and examples.<br />Another thing I really enjoyed about the reference section of this book, is that \\"gotchas\\" are clearly outlined.  Where there are tricky little things you wouldn't think about, or differences in how Java behaves depending on what your might expect, this book explains these issues.  In any case, the reference section covers the java.lang, java.util, java.io libraries in addition to providing detailed discussion of using networking and AWT libraries.	2003-07-06
US	49600352	R2WAJOSG0ISPHM	0735712573	36076297	PostgreSQL	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Good reference	A large section of the book goes into PL/pgSQL programming.  Like Oracle's PL/SQL or SQL Server's T-SQL, PostgreSQL has it's own SQL programming language.  The book discusses the basics of using PL/pgSQL in addition to more complex information (including cursors and triggers).<br />The next section of the book really go into examples of using PostgreSQL in specific development environments.  Specifically, chapters are dedicated to the use of PostgreSQL in Java code (examples are provided in which JDBC connections are made), PHP and Perl, and even ODBC (for those of us using non-open source languages).  I especially liked these chapters, as they really helped me see exactly how to implement database calls to PostgreSQL.<br />The last third of the book is really designed for database administrators.  In this section, information is provided on doing everything you need to do from a DBA perspective on PostgreSQL.  There is information on configuration, security, and internationalization.  One section I particularly found useful was on things to watch out for when running PostgreSQL in a Windows environment (specifically during installation).	2003-07-06
US	49600352	RSX017P5M2U8M	0596003811	549288882	Oracle PL/SQL Programming, Third Edition	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great PL/SQL reference	The book is really a reference manual.  You'll certainly learn a lot by reading the book from cover to cover, but you'll probably get more out of it by just having it handy by your computer.  Each chapter contains clear explanations on the specific subject, a function reference (if applicable), and troubleshooting.  <br />The book has been updated for Oracle 9i, which is nice, however, the book is still a great reference even if you're not using 9i.  Certain sections of the previous edition were condensed or removed for this edition, however, those sections are available in their entirety on O'Reilly's web site.  This extra information may be useful to readers running older versions of Oracle (like me).  All the examples used in this book can also be downloaded from the web.	2003-07-06

Basically, this book shows various different ways to get Google to provide you with the information you want.  Additionally, there is a discussion on accessing the Google API, to integrate this search engine with your custom application.  Finally, there is a discussion on what a webmaster can do to increase their \\"page ranking\\", the way Google ranks sites.<br />My favorite section of this book was on accessing the Google web API.  Basically, this API allows you to integrate Google searches directly into your application via a web service.  In addition to discussing the API, actual program examples are provided in Perl, Java, C#, Python, and VB.NET.  For example, you could integrate Google's dictionary directly into Microsoft Word to provide a more comprehensive dictionary than is provided.  <br />Another really cool example provided integrates the Google and Amazon.com's API.  In this example, the author shows how these APIs are integrated to show a list of \\"most popular\\" books, followed by recent news articles on the books and a list of items that people bought who also purchased the book in question.  It's pretty cool and quite impressive.<br />The book ends with a section dedicated to the web master.  This section goes over a good guess for the mathematical equation used in Google's mysterious page algorithm, and describes what you can do to increase your visibility on Google.  The book even includes a list of \\"thou shalt not\\", which can keep your site from being indexed by Google.	2003-07-06

However, this book actually goes one step further: all the content in the book is provided on an accompanying CD, which integrates an electronic version of the book directly into Visual Studio .NET.  This means that (like the regular MSDN documentation), the O'Reilly documentation becomes a part of your context-sensitive help.  Now that's pretty cool!<br /> The book is current with the 1.1 version of the Framework, which is a big deal, since there were some pretty significant changes to XML in this release (which is integral to ADO.NET).  Like all the other Nutshell books, this one begins out with a quick introduction to all of the more popular classes in ADO.NET through explanation and examples of use.  I personally enjoyed the section on DataTables, as there is a lot of discussion on things I don't normally do in conjunction with DataTables, like computing aggregate calculations and merging data sets.<br />Even though this is an ADO.NET book, the authors realize that you can't talk about just ADO.NET, you really need some discussion on implementing the data in a GUI (like using a DataGrid).  The authors actually spend some time discussing various issues in data binding and various methods for retrieving and displaying data via this mechanism.<br />Finally, there is considerable discussion (for a Nutshell book) on the relationship between a DataSet and XML.  This discussion also includes the basics of using an XSLT to transform XML.	2003-07-06

This is one book that was actually fairly easy to read from cover to cover (given the subject matter), but could also be quite easily used as a reference manual.<br />Like all reference books, I was quite pleased to find a really well put together set of appendices.  In this final section, the authors discuss system tables (including purpose and schema) as well as undocumented DBCC commands.  Perhaps even more useful is a final section on the built-in extended stored procedures available in SQL Server 2000.	2003-07-06
US	49600352	R13GBO6SF57PZC	0596003609	260378994	Mastering Visual Studio .Net	Books	4	41	42	N	N	Lots of good material	I have to admit that when I picked up a copy of this book, I was expecting a rather out of date re-hash of much of Microsoft's Visual Studio documentation.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Even though Visual Studio .NET 2003 only recently became commercially available, this book is written for the new IDE (rather than last year's model).  The book goes through the basics of projects, debugging, and even macros (in addition to a wide range of other topics).<br />This book follows the basic flow a programmer would follow when setting up and creating a project in Visual Studio, which makes it easy to follow along (especially if you are new to VS.NET).  After a discussion on setting up a project (including the differences between the various project types), the reader is presented with a discussion on debugging tips and techniques (including debugging configuration in the project's properties).  Since web projects are a little different from creating a Windows application, there is a whole chapter dedicated to configuration and debugging of a web application.  Other chapters include a discussion on how to perform database work through the IDE, and instructions on developing installation projects.  <br />My absolute favorite chapter, however, was on Automation, Macros, and Add-ins.  In this chapter, the reader learns the basics of creating macros that integrate directly into VS.NET.  If you are familiar with recording macros in the Microsoft Office applications, you will be pleased to learn that the syntax and functionality is similar (although instead of writing macros in VBA, they are written in VB.NET).  There is then further discussion on automating the IDE to perform scheduled tasks (like automated builds).	2003-07-06
US	49600352	R3S23G7188AXKU	0596004966	385975590	C++ Pocket Reference	Books	4	24	26	N	N	Great pocket reference	The C++ Pocket Reference is designed for C or Java developers who occasionally program in C++ and need a syntax reminder.  Not designed as a tutorial or provide lengthy instruction on the subject, this book is great for a one paragraph explanation on a particular topic.  <br />I found this to be a very useful and easy to follow book.   It starts out with the basics of writing a C++ program (processor directives, data types) and slowly moves into more complicated aspects of this language (like templates and memory management).<br />I would highly recommend this as a reference book if you find yourself occasionally doing some programming in C++.	2003-07-06
US	49600352	R2RKLTBJQ0Y0HP	0596003471	124418534	Programming .Net Components	Books	5	103	104	N	N	Best advanced C# book I have seen	While the book is supposed to be centered on \\".NET\\" components, it's really more about C# than anything else.  After the obligatory introduction to .NET, JIT, MSIL, and all the other .NET acronyms, the book gets down to business.  In fact, this book really begins where a lot of other C# books tend to end: interfaces and inheritance.  There is then discussion on version control, including using multiple versions of an assembly in the GAC.  While I have seen this type of discussion in other .NET books, I haven't seen it discussed in the depth that Löwy's book does it.<br />I think the thing I most enjoyed about this book was the chapter on Remoting.  Again, I have seen discussions on Remoting in other books (including Microsoft's own MSDN documentation), but no where have I seen as thorough a discussion with as many useful examples as in this book.  <br />Other topics covered in this book include multithreading, asynchronous calls, serialization (including various types of serialization formatters), interception, and security.  This book is not for the beginning .NET programmer.  If you're looking for a good introductory C# book, pick up a copy of Jesse Liberty's book.  If you're looking for a intermediate to advanced text, then this is one of the very best I have seen.  More of the \\"hard\\" stuff to do in .NET is covered in this book than in any other place I have seen.  I can honestly say that this is the best advanced C# book I have ever seen.	2003-07-06

I have always felt that Flash was a designer-only tool, inaccessible to the likes of programmers.  This book tries to change all that by making Flash development accessible to programmers.  I believe the book is also designed for designers who want to understand OOP in ActionScript.<br />After a brief introduction to OOP (which is all done through UML) and ActionScript syntax, the reader is presented with constructing an application from start to finish.  I was particularly pleased that this example uses the famous MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, familiar to many OOP programmers.  After completing this chapter, the reader will have a good understanding of the basics of OOP in ActionScript.<br />The next section of the book discusses many of the tiny details in the previous chapter in much more depth.  There is discussion on using pre-built Flash components in your application as well as building your own components.  Each of these topics are covered in sufficient depth to satisfy the reader.<br />The final section of the book seems to be \\"everything else you need to know about Flash and ActionScript\\".  This section includes a discussion on debugging your application, useful tips and tricks, and even an introduction to Flash remoting.	2003-07-06

If you don't have much programming experience and want to get into .NET, I'd suggest finding another book.  However, if you're a professional programmer or have some pretty good experience in C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, etc. you'll find this book very accessible and a good introduction to the C# language.<br />While the book has a total of five chapters, there are really only two chapters with any meat to them.  Not to say the other three are worthless, they just don't have quite the depth of information contained in the other two.<br />Expect to learn everything you need to know about data types, conversions, access modifiers, interfaces, events and delegates, and even unsafe code (using pointers).  The examples are short and to the point.  You will probably want more detail or another example for some of the topics covered, but enough is presented to give you a good start.	2002-03-13

If you're familiar with any of O'Reilly's definitive guides, you know that they are famous for having a small \\"how-to\\" section followed by some of the best reference material you can find.  <br />The first two sections of this book (Core JavaScript, Client-Side JavaScript) are the \\"how-to\\" section, covering virtually every aspect of the JavaScript language.  While the Core JavaScript section covers JavaScript syntax, functions, objects and regular expressions, the second section (Client-Side JavaScript) covers how to implement this in a web browser.  Clear and concise examples are given, which relate to each topic covered.<br />The next two sections (Core JavaScript Reference and Client-Side JavaScript Reference) are worth their weight in gold.  These sections are certainly not easy to read from start to end, but are perfect for finding very useful information quickly.	2002-03-13

This book has a little for everyone: you'll learn something if you know the basics of SQL, but have never really done anything with it.  You'll also learn something if you've had a lot of experience with Microsoft SQLServer (and T-SQL), but are looking to transition you knowledge to Oracle PL/SQL.<br />You'll learn about coding anonymous blocks, stored procedures, functions, and packages.  You will learn how to write and use cursors, how to organize code into packages, Oracle security basics, Oracle built in packages, and error handling.  The book also covers some basics of using SQL*Plus, to make your life a little easier.<br />If you need a relatively small (less than 400 pages) introduction to Oracle PL/SQL, then this is definitely a book you will want to pick up.  If you need more in-depth information after reading this book, pick up the authors' other book Oracle PL/SQL.	2002-03-13

Some great explanations and examples, but most are at a very introductory level.<br />The chapter on ASP.NET is well organized, and everyone interested in using ASP.NET will learn something.  There is a great section on data validation and a clear explanation on how to use the Application, Session, and Cookie objects.  ASP developers should have little trouble ramping up to ASP.NET quickly.  Be aware that the coverage of ADO.NET is sketchy at best.<br />All in all, Programming Visual Basic .NET is a good book.  Not the best book you'll ever read on the subject, but a good beginning level book.  If you've every had any experience with Visual Basic or ASP, most of the examples will be very easy to pick up on.  However, you'll want to pick up at least one additional book to cover some of the gaps left by this book.	2002-03-13
