From a technical viewpoint, he abuses the passive voice excessively in nearly all of his books and magazine articles.  \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" is tedious, partly because of Krakauer's style and partly because he fails to establish a solid thesis.  One moment he seems to criticize the LDS for their barbaric legacy; the next, he writes like a Mormon apologist. <br /> <br />Despite these glaring faults, the book contains a great deal of important and disturbing information.  The modern LDS church shares more of its heritage with Mormon fundamentalists than any of them care to admit.  Scratch the surface of any mainstream Mormon and you're likely to uncover a homophobic, mysogenistic racist. <br /> <br />I have lived among Mormons for many years and I have relatives who are current or former LDS.  I have been to LDS wards and I have attended services.  Their wards are bereft of artwork and their ceremonies, lifeless and depressing.  I sometimes joke that it's like \\"Pleasantville\\" without all the culture. <br /> <br />Mormons themselves are very nice people, but if you're not Mormon, they won't invite you to dinner and they won't come to visit unless it's to discuss religion.  They maintain clear boundaries between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\". <br /> <br />Most families have a husband whose mandate is to work hard and earn money, a wife whose mandate is to make babies and tend to the brood and children whose job is to grow up to make more money and more babies.  It is a sterile, humorless existence: George Orwell meets St. Augustine. <br /> <br />Krakauer notes that the church is growing quickly in the U.S. and could become a prominent political force within the next 30 years.  With that in mind, I recommend this book to anyone who is unfamiliar with the Mormon church.	2005-08-25

In that sense it is a necessary contribution to the software engineering literature. <br /> <br />However, the examples are at times unclear and the author does not always motivate them convincingly.  From a technical writing perspective, the passive voice plagues this book from start to end, forcing readers to stop and reread sections to make sense of convoluted prose.	2005-04-08
US	53078196	R9Z2BN6H03ML5	0072930330	747442192	Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications	Books	2	12	14	N	N	Reasonably good text, very poor student/instructor guides.	The text itself is brief, but still a good overview of discrete mathematics.  The main problem is the student and instructor guides.  The answers frequently have errors and problems are not reiterated in the text, so a student or a grader has to flip back and forth between at least two books to make sense of the solutions.  Even more frustrating for students is the fact that some problems do not have good answers: the author admits that he cannot solve the problem and refers to answers from other problems instead.  This is simply not fair to students who may be struggling with the material. <br /> <br />As a teaching assistant, it is not up to me to select the text books.  If it were, I would look for a replacement.	2005-03-29

Much of what Smith reported is still true, including the chiropractor's use of sales catch-phrases designed to keep patients coming back for more.<br />I have talked with chiropractors who maintain to this day that there is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against them in the medical community.  When I've been able to probe for details, this &quot;conspiracy&quot; turns out to be little more than the disdain which the scientific community expresses regarding pseudo-scientific quackery.<br />There are still chiropractors out there who claim to cure diseases such as epilepsy, MS and cancer.  This much has not changed and it is still as dangerous as ever.	2004-06-17

He's not a particularly gifted writer, but he knows his genre.  However, it was good to read a novel about a lawyer who grows a conscience.<br />I think for anyone who has dealt directly with the homeless, this book will strike a chord.  For those who ignore or deny the existence of social problems, it will merely be another thorn in the side.	2002-06-11

Some phrases were straight out of a bad romance novel, for example, &quot;She was a beast; but when he closed his eyes, she was a woman.&quot;  Is the author still in high school?<br />Dialog for some characters was inconsistent and in some cases, overly stereotyped.  For pure entertainment, it was fine; but if you're looking for a well-written novel, there are plenty of others to choose from.	2002-06-11
US	53078196	RPWQU6VATIPOE	0967258219	474987756	Beyond the Edge	Books	1	4	5	N	N	A Big Disappointment	Mike Dennison went to some exotic locations and got photos of himself doing handstands there.  That pretty much sums up this book.  If you've never, ever, traveled beyond the outskirts of your home town, then maybe - just maybe - this book has something to offer you.  But if you've ever been outside the U.S. and have a modicum of curiosity about the rest of the world, you already know more than this book can tell you.<br />The book's subtitle is &quot;A backpacking trip around the world.&quot;  The author did not do a &quot;backpacking trip&quot;, nor did he travel &quot;around the world&quot;.  He kept his travel gear in a backpack, but if he spent any time in the back country, he didn't write much about it.  As for going &quot;around the world&quot;, he visted locations in Southeast Asia, Africa and Western Europe.<br />The author didn't bother to learn much of the history or geography of the places he visited.  As a result his insights are superficial and his descriptions, bland.  Despite having made this trip when he was in his 40's, the author seems naive as a teenager.  As if to emphasize this adolescent tenor, or perhaps to fill out his thin narrative, he treats readers to facile observations on his traveling companions' marital problems.<br />It may seem mercurial to give this book one star when others have given it five, but I honestly cannot find a reason to give it more.	2002-01-07

It was cute, and it was funny, but really the humor is predictable - no better or worse than any witty conversation you'd expect between coworkers or friends.	2002-01-07

Except for some bad luck, he probably would have survived to write his own account of his travels.  One telling comment of Krakauer's is (to paraphrase), &quot;for some, a challenge is only worthwhile if the outcome is in doubt&quot;.  If nothing else, Chris' story is a good seed for debates on the relative merits of freedom and safety.<br />Regardless of one's opinion of Chris and his lifestyle, the book is an interesting read.  I look forward to reading Krakauer's other books.	2002-01-07

Spong demonstrates a thorough understanding of Christian apologetics. He openly admits he is not ready to merely chuck decades of service to the church to embrace atheism. I found it easy to sympathize with his struggle. But when he attempts to reduce Christian mythology to its core tangible elements, he sounds as lost as any new-age &quot;guru&quot;. His words and thoughts become vague and unfocused. Stripped of its mythological framework, Christianity becomes nothing more than &quot;the essence of being&quot; in Spong's hands. He is unwilling to release the last vestiges of his superstition. Many people become atheist because, over years of studying their religion, they learn there is simply no &quot;there&quot; there - the emporer really has no clothes. Spong seems to have reached that point, yet still ponders the essence of the emporer's outfit.	2001-08-24

It's a good book for learning Spanish, but there are a lot of small mistakes which will make the process frustrating at times. In some places there are quiz questions related to words which weren't presented earlier in the book. However, it does contain good explanations of how and when to use different phrasing. I also appreciated the explanations of some patterns for irregular verbs. The real test will be when I travel to South America in a few weeks...!	2001-08-24

I liked Sheehan's articles in &quot;Runner's World&quot; years ago, and I liked his book &quot;Running to Win&quot;.<br />This one simply isn't as good.  For whatever reason, Sheehan seemed bent on naming as many other thinkers as he could, without appearing to really assimilate much.<br />If you have never read any philosophy yourself, you may find some value in this book; but if you've studied philosophy at all, I'd recommend you skip it.	2001-04-05

I'm not a Neitsche fan, but I paraphrase him above since it certainly applies here.  C.S. Lewis gives a prosaic overview of why he chose to be a Christian.  In lieu of honest inquiry he proffers flowery postulates with  barely a hint of evidence.  This is not a bad book if you're looking for a  plausible excuse to be religious; but if you're not afraid to take a closer  look at Christianity, read something like Dan Barker's &quot;Losing Faith  in Faith&quot;.  Or, for a closer look at religion in general, read  Campbell's four-book series entitled &quot;The Masks of God&quot;.	1999-09-02

It is amazing (and a bit sad) to see how little has changed since Lewis first created this character.  I've often wondered how anyone could lead the depraved life of  an evangelist and still sleep nights.  Given his flair for depicting  turn-of-the-century middle America, Lewis paints a plausible picture.<br />In  addition to &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, I've read &quot;Main Street&quot;,  &quot;Babbit&quot; and &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;.
