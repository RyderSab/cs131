I got this book because I wanted to know what the protocol was for taking out a demon - just incase I move into some old house where I find a strange man with deep eyes wandering in the basement.  You wont find anything really useful here, this book is pure tedium!  I never thought that Malachi would twist and lie to such a degree; I never realized how warped he was.  I did dig into this book with some enthusiasm, but Martin squashed that by writing that the enneagram is the biggest threat to lead to a possession (the enneagram which was made by the jesuits!).  Malcachi was certainly bitter about anything new happening to his religion, such things happen in seniority.  I now know that he was just an old man who didn't like this new fangled modern psychology.  Like lots of the other reviews, I must emphasize that this book is way too wordy, and could be 1000% percent smaller with the same amount of disinformation.  The only idea that this book opened up to me was that I should do a little investigation of the interpretation of these exorcisms in other theologies (taoism, judaism, buddhism,etc.).  Just so you know, the first girl is possessed for something that seems like simple meditation, and the second dude gets full of the devil by believing in evolution. The first and longest part of an exorcism is trying to get the devil to show itself by berating this &quot;seemingly normal person&quot; until the breakthrough occurs - this processive attack usually takes days, and may take weeks!  (Uhh... I wonder what's going on here... satan always shows his face after 5 days of food and sleep deprivation... such a trickster...) Try this book if you really want to feel sorry for those little fundamentalist types (the same ones that think that mother Theresa was evil for allowing other religions to be respected).	2003-10-30

The thing with many books on mindfulness, is that they don't offer anything except encouragement to be mindfull.  I would suggest this book for occassional reading for those who often forget their consciousness for days at a time.  Slow and continuous reading will help implement the motivation to be more aware.	2003-10-18

It is quite complete and easy to read.  It might be more suited to people who are willing to put some work in to find out all of the different elements that affect the person being read.  I was able to guess times (rising signs) of some people I know using this book - I thought that was amazing at the time.  Anybody who thinks that they are a religious or spiritual person should atleast take the time to have a look at astrology, and this is the perfect book for newbies (yet comprehensive).	2003-10-18

It is an interesting work of the imagination that can only increase your own writing and thinking creativity.  I like Jitterbug Perfume more than ARA, but this book is still worth the time.

I found the accuracy of this book to be as expected when it comes to astrology.  It's over the 50% mark for explaining the personalities of my friends and family; it isn't amazing.  A few of the people I looked up were nothing like the description, but these were the exceptions.  If there were some reference to rising signs then this book would be a keeper, otherwise, I suggest that you just get it at your library and photocopy all of the dates that are of interest.  This book is for people who are unmotivated to look up every planet and house of the people they want to know about.	2003-10-18

It uses short common sense quizes to teach the material, and then some who-done-it action to show the application in the real world.  I plowed through this book very quickly, and the information seems to have stayed up until now.  It focuses on finding lies or drug users/criminals (and none of the suspect cases are innocent).<br />I decided to deduct a star for several reasons.  The first is that all of the information is more than a decade old, and it doesn't get very deep into personality analysis.  The other thing that made me a little weary of the book was how introverts and perfectionists/pessimists got a bum rap all the way through (as I'm an introvert).  It's obvious that McNichol loves extroverts and conformity.  She also uses &quot;drug user&quot; like someone else would use &quot;total garbage&quot;.  My advice if you read this book is to take out all of the indications for &quot;criminal tendancies&quot; and just replace it with non-conformist... and forget about reading the chapter on doodles, it's less consistent than dream analysis.	2003-10-18

Okay, I couldn't find my name in here, and there wasn't any other alternatives.  So, if your name is Miles - or something close to that, don't expect anything.  The accuracy was disappointing for the most part.  I have to believe that these profiles fit for a lot of people, but I would put a little caption at the bottom of the screen saying, &quot;for entertainment purposes only&quot; just for those with my such luck.

My Martial Art is the SUPREME martial art in the world! syndrome).  I am not really interested in the martial arts, but in the esoteric teachings - secrets are always begging for attention.  This book has a couple of good meditations by one of Glenn's former students, and a lot of anecdotes from his and his students.  I loved the previous two books, and I think this one is definitely worth the time (mostly for the bibliography), but maybe not as good.	2003-10-18

First of all, this book has got some big dimensions, so, uh, well I wasn't expecting the pages to be so large and atlas like.  I didn't get very much from this book, and the problem might be that I am healthy.  I do wear glasses though, so I am currently trying to fix me peepers to a flatter lense.  There isn't very much when it comes to the eye exercises though, so let me just give a summary so you can get started right away:<BR>-try to relax your eyes, forehead, jaw, neck, etc. as often as possible (you will notice an improvement after a few days of relieving the constant unconscious squeezing)<BR>-exercise your eyes by alternating viewing bright objects (the sun with CLOSED eyelids) and darkness (palming, where you cover your eyes with your palms and blocking out all light)<BR>-palming.  I don't know how, but it works.  I cover my eyes with my palms for about 10 minutes a day and my vision has improved slightly in just a few days.  Might be related to reiki.  I also seen palming recommended in a book instructing how to gain scrying vision.<BR>That's what I have used from the eye fixing chapter, the only other thing that seems of use for healthy people is the beginning chapter on improving your breathing capacity.	2003-10-18

Great for self exploration and understanding, and if you are willing to put the work in, it is the best tool I know to understand others (espcecially &quot;crazy&quot; others).<BR>This book is useful for friends and family as well, even though they might deny your categorization of their personality.	2003-09-19

This book is a description of a journey up the ladder of spirituality in the astral world according to ECK.  ECK gets lots of praise from its authors, but when I put it to the test I can't truthfully differentiate it spiritually from simply eating food.  Paul Twitchell introduces us to all of the different gods that control reality, and has extremely boring and pointless monologues from each.  If I could do this soul traveling and experience this stuff for myself then I might find it more interesting, but the method of ECK of singing hue and staring at your third eye have only given me a headache.	2003-09-19

If you've read a few books on Zen and mindfulness, then you're probably easily bored with new authors finding new ways to say, &quot;pay attention!&quot;  This book steps away from the rest by using the ideas of Almaas and essence.  This is a very useful book to read slowly and repeatedly.  It does not contain any miracle methods for killing the superego, but it has lots of simple and useful exercises to explore the depth of your judge.<BR>I especially recommend this book to shy people.	2003-09-19

This book is almost a chapter by chapter introduction to all of Grof's different areas of research and writing.  The written experiences of holotropic states are entertaining and informative.  This book adds a needed understanding to psychology by examining consciousness around the time of birth.  The author is obviously well versed on many topics, and presents sound logic and arguments throughout.  Holotropic breathwork might be very useful for anyone suffering from their personality (especially to those that are fear based).

I like the ideas of ECK for the most part, but the dogma of ECK is a little too harsh still.  You are not allowed to drink or look at other forms of religion when an ECKist.  After reading this book I think some ECKists would consider some bad karma has come over me by not lavishing stars over this review.  Now that I have explained my bias... the book is rather dull.  It's an autobiography about Klemps life in ECK.  He struggles with his fundamentalist christian family and friends about his involvement with ECK, and with the politics of the ECK hierarchy.  The best parts of the book are his soul traveling experiences with the different masters, but they can't even compare to other books on astral travel (with more practical instruction and attainable results).<br />I've tried ECK.  I've sang HU (in all of its pronounciations) for a few weeks, and read several other titles on it.  I have nothing notable that I can speak for the time I spent.  If you are new to the ideas of soul travel or ECK, I suggest you look at a few titles on astral travel before you get too bogged down with the dogma.	2003-09-19

It's good for the little details that other people and books might confuse - like which hand to use to closing the orbit.  I really wish that this book had more information, especially about the orbit as it goes through the legs and arms.

This is a big book, and it has a lot of information regarding several different energy systems that Donna has tried to tie together (by treating them as separate layers of the whole).  There is a great deal on the chinese meridians - which I actually didn't enjoy because it lacked any real good detail on manipulating them, but encouraged a routine tracing of them with your fingertips (you'll probably only go through all of that once).  I would use this book as an introduction to the many topics inside.  Unfortunately, even though it is a big book, it still needed to give me a little bit more to chew on.  Donna doesn't bring a lot of new information to the knowledgable reader; I would use this book if I was totally green to these ideas, or if I needed some fundamental reminders.  Active readers on the energy body might find this book a little over-rated, and you'll be frustrated going through some sections if you don't have some psychic sight activity.	2003-06-24

I find the meditations to be quite a chore for what I've gotten from them.  He also throws in some of his style of tantra meditations after you finish the introductory ones (where you flex and hold and release every little part of your body until you start to really hate doing the meditations).  I even got the Regardie tapes (recommended in the book), so he can scream the mantras from my stereo while I lay there and try to avoid thinking of the time.

Of course, once I checked out the books page I found out that it hasn't even been released yet - so I anxiously waited to find out what the liberals are doing.

It's about understanding your biology, and then directing it.  I dropped a star from my rating because this book fails in the same place where all the other shamanistic books do: the meditations.  I don't know how many people have psychic sight, but some of the meditations involve heavy visualizations that require this (which is probably helped tremendously by some form of psychedelics).

I decided to pop a 2 star down just to balance out all of the exaggerration votes thrown up for this teeny tiny book.  Take a look at the dimensions of this book.  All it says is to always tell the truth, always try as hard as you can, to never take anything personal, and don't make assumptions.  This book is the type that you read and it inspires you to behave a little differently for a day or two, but is entirely forgettable beyond that point.  I think that for the same amount of money you can get a book that is 4 times bigger and actually has something to digest.  This book didn't change me at all.

Don't take this rating too seriously though, because nothing of trance work or astral projection has been successful with me thus far.	2003-06-20

Patriotism is one of the only acceptable forms of pride today, and I wonder if that is right....  This book may make you feel better about this country that we live in, but it is just a cozy blanket of nationalism for this harsh world we must survive in.  I wonder how being born in a certain country makes it right to say how much better it is than the rest of the world.  Why do we have the national anthem before every sporting event?  (now we know that some percentage of almost every team we have here is comprised of some percentage of foreigners)  I'll go the opposite way of this book and ask that people can just accept that people who live in other countries are just as precious as those who live here!	2003-06-20

Of course, now that we have hindsight it is easy to see how frothed and crazed the Clinton attackers were, and how all of the politics were just overblown exploitations in the name of pride.  This book gives great details and meat into the situation and keeps one entertained untill the end.	2003-06-20
