I've done some data modeling, and much more process modeling, so I was familiar with Mr. Hay's objectives with respect to data and restricting the model to logical representations of data, whatever that may be.<br /><br />About six chapters into this book, I realize that while I could continue through to the end, I would likely find this more useful as a companion to a problem.  I think the majority of non-academic readers, software practitioners if you will, will extract the necessary value from owning this book given a specific objective, i.e. I have to develop a work management model from scratch, and these are my (current) business rules.<br /><br />The book covers so many kinds of models that it's entirely possible a reader will have no practical frame of reference, such as the chapter on accounting.  Modern accounting software is primarily off-the-shelf, so developing a data model for it isn't something very common today.  However, the smart developer understands that living \\"in the spaces between\\" software is a very good line of business, so to that end knowing what an ideal data model might have is certainly valuable ammunition when weighing vendor claims and evaluating solutions.<br /><br />Because it lacks that sort of accessible readability, I am withholding a star.  I'd have withheld a half-star if it were possible; I believe the book has great value to a developer or analyst.<br /><br />Fred	2005-05-31

Style guides tend to be heuristics of understanding a hard-to-define -- consequently hard to defend -- criteria that will make your design effective.  Strunk's \\"Elements of Style\\" would be an exemplary definition of a style guide.  With all style guides, however, you can follow them religiously and still end up with an execrable book or living room.<br /><br />Mr. Celko spends remarkably little time with style formatting, although he does delineate what constitutes readable and maintainable SQL code.  Where the book finds its utmost utility is in the consistent and increasing reinforcement of thinking in sets.  SQL is not about transforming data (although you can); SQL is about properly storing data, and then being able to find it again.  Simple enough, but all-too-easy to get wrong.<br /><br />The first two chapters talk about naming and actual SQL style.  This is primarily what I'd expected, but Mr. Celko isn't about to let me off that easily.  In discussing naming, he brings international standards into the mix.  Right away, the standard of my existing SQL code falls away under this level of scrutiny.  Throughout the book, Mr. Celko is bringing up a data discipine I have long-suspected existed but honestly never sought to embrace.  Why should I develop a data model that adheres to standards, if mine will be the only model in the company even attempting it?<br /><br />Therein lays the problem with this book: it can make a reader uncomfortable.  Mr. Celko is writing about SQL and, more importantly, the data it will describe and manipulate, in far more depth and with far more rigor than I've seen elsewhere.  He has an entire chapter on encoding data, another on scales used to measure data.  Nowhere else will such treatment be gathered in one place, in the context of using SQL.  Moreover, his conclusions are backed by years of experience *and* impressive references to back him.  The bibliography will surely cause me to invest in yet more books.<br /><br />Of course, the book can be dry in spots.  Encoding data properly is important, but it's not as entertaining as seeing his effective SQL examples put to work.  I think the balance between showing data as it is displayed and explaining the theory of the encoding (or modeling, or selection) is tricky to achieve, but I don't believe it ever broke down.  The *density* of the book is striking; going into a 195-page book, you don't readily expect to re-read the same page three times to grasp something, but you must.  At some point in the book, you will encounter an aspect of SQL development you've never come close to mastering, and it will give you pause.  Take notes, work it out, and dig deeper.  It'll be worth it.<br /><br />Could I recommend this to newcomers to SQL programming?  Qualified yes; you need to discipline yourself to work through much of it if you lack the experience in what's being presented.  The book would make an excellent two-semester course in database development, one I suspect many would enjoy more than the typical relational database classes taught today.<br /><br />Mr. Celko has again delivered an essential text on SQL, and it would serve as a springboard for a thorough introduction to all things data.<br /><br />Fredcourse, the book can be dry in spots.

William Gibson has always labored under the same dilemma as Pearl Jam: a debut that can never be equalled or approached by any subsequent efforts.  This is not a criticism of any work either has done since \\"Neuromancer\\" or \\"Ten\\", respectively.  It just that following up such a near-perfect creation is destined to eternally fall short.<br /><br />This latest novel marks a subtle shift in temporal context for Mr. Gibson, since the progenitor of the cyberpunk genre is associated with science fiction set in some future.  This is firmly set in 2003 or thereabouts, so the disorientation readers have enjoyed due to alternate future realities is now a disorientation due to alien cultures.  This is no less effective, and in some ways more enjoyable and intriguing as it seems more accessible.<br /><br />Some earlier criticisms of Mr. Gibson's plot devices seem to hold their value: underdog on mission, powerful forces at work, the super-rich versus the super-smart in a conspiracy of global scale.  And so what?  When I ride roller coasters, I know there's a slow climb, a fast drop, turns and loops.  I still enjoy the execution of a well-designed roller coaster.<br /><br />Mr. Gibson delivers another good ride, and with his characteristic style cues and hints fully engaged in immersing this reader in a fascinating (and far more interesting) version of London, Tokyo, and New York City.  Possibly the most fun in reading this novel was in seeing how sci-fi the world could seem in his hands.  Presenting these cultures in such a way as to make them appear truly alien is fascinating and impressive.  Mr. Gibson's talent seems to have reached another level with this book.<br /><br />The usual strengths apply: Mr. Gibson's prowess with dialogue and atmosphere have few peers, and the plot moves along smoothly, if a steeply, as you may be tempted to race through certain parts to turn the next corner, so to speak.  Resist the temptation and savor the words, because before you know it, you'll be 50 pages from the end and wishing you had another 300 to go.<br /><br />Fredt, you'll be 50 pages from the end and wishing you had another 300 to go. <br /> <br />Fred	2005-04-27

I needed to link to this book for a blog entry, and I was looking for my review of this book when I realized I never wrote one.  I can't believe it, since I use this book nearly once a week to jog my memory on some of the more esoteric SQL problems I need to solve.<br /><br />I didn't find the math as challenging as others, and not because I have advanced mathematical skills (I don't).  The set theory is fairly straightforward and actually simplified, attempting to re-orient your thinking away from procedural code and more towards discrete structures.  Believe me, reading the original Chris Date papers or Dr. Codd research on database theory would represent real mathematical challenges.<br /><br />As there are many kinds of readers with different skill levels, it's possible the book holds no suprises for some.  However, as someone who has used it frequently, I can't say I've seen many errors or typos in it.  I don't code the examples directly into my database, either, because I translate the concepts directly into actual work-related problems.<br /><br />I've found it to be an essential guide for experienced SQL developers who are looking to keep learning in a practical manner, but intuit that there is something more to SQL than the mechanics of syntax.  Really changing your thinking to set-based rather than procedural problem solving is what the book tries to achieve, and it succeeds.  This text is an unqualified, solid recommendation for anyone looking to evolve into a senior SQL developer.<br /><br />Fred	2005-03-16

I had fallen away from picking up any of Stephen King's later work, never having forgotten the bad taste of \\"Tommyknockers\\" and subsequent lesser efforts from the author who penned \\"Salem's Lot\\".  I picked this up from a friend who picked it up from a library sale.  Hardcover, super condition, so what the heck.<br /><br />I found it to be a more literary work, but not removed at all from the typical style and tempo of Mr. King.  The reader is treated to a very well set-up plot, and once in place, Mr. King lets it unwind.  In some places it moves quickly, and in others you might get the sense of savoring some of the scenery being described... and not being at all disappointed.  The blurred line between the narrator and the author made it doubly-interesting to me, as I imagined that one some level I was getting a glimpse into what the author's work life might be like, and where the ideas flowed from.<br /><br />What also struck me is running bibliography, something I didn't expect the fin in a novel by Mr. King but nonetheless a welcome bonus.  I review and discuss review on Amazon, and in doing so get some really good recommendations for further reading.  To get some recommendations from an author whose work I respect, well, you simply add them to your Wish List and smile in appreciation.<br /><br />All right, *I* smile in appreciation.  Mr. King still hasn't evolved past some of his old plot devices and standard themes, which upon reflection detract from the book perceptibly.  For example, how many times have you read a King story describing  stalwart Yankee toughness, which is invariably contradicted by their lack of character and integrity when it counts?  Or graphic depiction of sex (not that I mind) between a beautiful woman (they always are... annoying) and the handsome writer.  The writer is clearly not Mr. King, but he is The God in This World of His, so call it a privilege he's never gotten tired of invoking.  Some readers, this one included, do get a little tired of the formula.

It's also a basic set of tenets for journalists, academics, and anyone else seeking truth among facts and fiction.<br /><br />What I gain from Karsh's book is an objective perspective of the origin of the modern conflict in Israel.  I am treated to primary sources, secondary accounts, and conclusions drawn directly from the evidence, and not wild imagination or heresay.  The way it hangs together, and the way it is written, almost compels you to consider going through the bibliography to learn more.  Presented in the context of an academic response to sloppy historiography, it is a scathing rebuttal that cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Presented as an introduction to the conflict, it doesn't stand alone.  More than basic familiarity with the facts of Israel's modern (re)birth as a nation is needed to understand a majority of the references.

Never more relevant than today, eighty-some years removed from World War I (to end all wars, ironically), this book deals with issues that nations still have not seemed to solved: fascist governments, disregard for due process, injustice in the name of expediency and national security.  That the US quarantines Japanese-Americans twenty years after its first run only embarasses us; that eighty years later we still do the same thing breaks your heart.<br />Mr. Cummings writes in a sort of stream-of-consciousness first person, something on the order of Romantic prose mixed with his own style that is inimitably his own.  A student of Cummings might be quick to see the parallel between his earliest poems and that evolution to his modern free verse, as taking place within this novel right before one's eyes.<br />Enjoyable stories, and Mr. Cummings and his friend are something of snobs, something of braggards even (becoming fluent in French after two weeks is extremely hard to believe).  The annoyance quickly passes (and crops up again whever he mentions how much more evolved he is than other Americans) when he paints such vivid mental images of life in the enormous room, the ennui and absurdity of being held without due process, and the veritable Ellis Island of characters populating his new world.<br />A reader would do well to approach this book without reading the hyperbole of its back cover or the well-meaning but misguided praqises of some reviewers.  This is a great book, but not a classic.  Cummings is not a master novelist, which does not dimish his effort or take anything from his creative genius.  Rather, it is much like falling into the trap of thinking a master in one form can be a master in another.  Enjoy the reading, and marvel at ironic relevance it holds for us today.<br />Fred	2004-05-17

This slender management text gives the reader a decent leg-up on the challenge of managing four general types of employee (or peer, if you have a lead role).  Although the title says &quot;Situational Leader&quot;, I'm not sure this is precisely leadership as much as management skill building.  Much of the work deals with assessing the people in your group, and making two decisions:  how compentent is this person for the task, and how motivated is this person to accomplish the task?  The four possibilities each have their own set of challenges.<br />Obviously, the unskilled and unmotivated person requires the most effort, as a manager will need to spell out in detail subtasks and ensure each subtask is accomplished.  More subtle but no less important is the management of your skilled and motivated team members.  Failing to acknowledge the achievements or to trust their competency could also lead to problems, perhaps even worse because a manager depends upon their superstars in a crunch.<br />I'm not a big fan of the hypothetical dialogue the author has chosen to illustrate workplace relevance, but it serves to introduce topics well and make them clear, if not obvious.  Properly studied and boiled down to a few chapters, this has a place in anyone's management library.<br />Fred	2004-05-17

Bad book reviews.<br />This book is essentially a 12 year-old military schoolkid's fantasy: going off to wage war against the bad guys singlehandedly.  It's actually a better book in 2004 than in 1987, since I can amuse myself with how ironic some of the premises are today: the Soviets building a ground-based laser to shoot down planes, missles, satellites, and probably sparrows.  The editors must've drawn the line at sparrows, but they left in the hot woman tech who wants to be treated as an equal, the gruff superior officer who's really a good guy, and a handful of other assorted types that every techothriller needed back then.<br />Character development?  Ah, that's a negative.  Lots of technology and insider jargon to make it realistic?  Check.  Lots of political insight, some plot twists?  Ah, that's a negative.

I'd blistered the editors for not organizing the book well, and took the author to task for some vagaries in his descriptions and the lightness of graphical assistance, i.e. crummy drawings and mediocre photographs.<br />I can say that the editors improved the book significantly.  The organization of the chapters is now more-logical, and it also begins in a very direct, simple manner that gradually adds complexity as you read.  Which is fine, since concepts introduced earlier are laying a foundation of knowledge required for the later , extremely scientific chapter on how muscles, tendons, and ligaments work together to move your body in three dimensions.<br />I enjoyed the new edition more than the third, and I was very pleased with the updates and corrections.  I believe you still need to invest some sweat to extract any value from this, but I would surmise no one is picking this up for light reading: this is an owner's manual for your body in some respects, and it requires hands-on application.<br />The fifth star is not forthcoming, and I don't think a fifth edition will change this.  The photographs and stick figures you loved to hate from prior editions are still here, and I can't help wonder why the publisher didn't just run a contest at SVA or Pratt for book illustrators.<br />Still, there's less excuses for readers to employ if they can't figure out a good routine after reading this book, and Thomas Kurz's admonishing commentary is hilarious: I can actually see him as a professor taking some of the dimmer student body to task for not fully reading the relevant material.

There has been an update made for 2003 which may or may not address the specific concerns herein.<br />We'll start with the technical contents.

Let's look at chapter one.<br />He makes some dubious assertions, such as page 15's highlight that thorough knowledge of SQL isn't necessary.  I need to state credentials here: I lead a technical team doing Oracle database development, and I've written code for IBM's DB2, Sybase's Enterprise Adaptive Server, Microsoft's SQL-Server, and now Oracle 8i, 9i, and 9iAS.  I'm telling everyone now: you can't be a professional database devloper or designer without thorough SQL knowledge.  If you don't know how to use it, or how people need to use your designs through SQL, then you're a liability to the team... not that you'd pass the technical interview after this book anyway.<br />And page 17 has a little gem about why relational databases were slow because the underlying architecture (CPU, DASD, etc.) wasn't fast enough.  Well, yeah, that and the fact that writing a relational database engine is hard, and requires serious horsepower.  It *is* the relational database's fault that it was initially slow, because it's not a trivial system.<br />Dear readers, this is just Chaper One, his overview of databases, and my commetary hadn't even developed full steam yet.<br />I have index cards for the first six chapters, all with some serious conflicts about his assertions, facts, and teaching methods.  I haven't done this kind of in-depth refutation (for free) since college, but the content troubled me enough to capture it.  It comes to this single point: this book will screw up beginners.<br />The terminology is wrong in some key spots.  The author doesn't distinguish poor design at first, and takes some liberties in naming things: multivalued fields are really variable arrays, he refuses to use industry terms like 'constraint', 'row', or 'column'.  By chapter three, I'd better not be seeing the components of a table referred to as 'fields' and 'records' but sure enough, he's plugging along.  He mixes in database design goals with business requirements gathering, meeting facilitation, and other stray bits of knowledge he happens to have laying around.  The book will not teach you database design correctly.<br />I think part of it is the goals of the book do not match the title.  This is trying to be a primer for beginniner database developers; at that task he's more successful, but claims of being &quot;database-independent&quot; fall woefully short: there's no mention of ANSI-SQL in any detail, which is the lingua franca of database developers and the only database-independent method of conveying universal principles.  Nope, he sticks to a decidely Access-oriented terminology (records and fields!  Fie on it!).<br />I'll stick with the two-star rating, because his latest version may yet hold promise for beginners, and because if you happen to be using Microsoft Access, this book will actually help you.

It's a graphic novel, folks, so if you aren't willing to<br />suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a first-rate<br />re-telling of a legend, then by all means use your money<br />to buy a historical survey of the same material.  Frank<br />Miller delivers good stories.  Leave history to the Schlesingers.<br />Let's say you're willing to take a shot on this book,<br />though.  You're in for a treat: Miller's artwork has never<br />been more expressive, and Lynn Varley hasn't lost a shade<br />of intensity or a single gradation in her palette.  And<br />one thing I tell anyone about a Miller project: you will be<br />surprised at how well Miller can write, considering how well<br />he illustrates.  It's a truly rare combination of talents,<br />and I've never been dissatisfied with his work.<br />Should you own this?  I'd say so.  And if you get any<br />criticism for owning a historically inaccurate account,<br />show them the bibliography at the back and let them see<br />that it was a conscious decision to tell a good story first.	2003-08-15

Arm yourself with verbs.  The nouns will come in time,<br />and adjectives and adverbs are a more advanced tool that you<br />will naturally acquire through extensive reading and speaking.<br />No, to gain fluency and functionality, you need verbs.<br />This book is a collection of 501 Portuguese verbs, with full<br />conjugations listed and some very informative usage examples below each listing.  Each verb takes up a page, has the English definition at the top, and lists the usage examples at the bottom.<br />The index at the end of the book lists verbs in English, then in Portuguese, providing an excellent method for finding your verb choice even if you are a Portueguse student learning English.  Yes, I meant exactly that: in learning Portuguese, I have found it helpful and enlightening to see what English words a Portuguese-speaker might choose, as it gives me insight into what a native might feel is the best translation of an idea.<br />The best feature of this book, however, is the front matter.  It explains each conjugation in depth, because if you are anything like me, you've forgotten exactly what a future subjunctive is.  Heck, I don't even know if I've used a grammatical term there or not; good thing I bought this book though, because it'll tell me in plain terms what I need to know.<br />This is truly a five-star reference.  A comprehensive dictionary would surpass it in coverage, but from the perspective of learning Portuguese, this book has no peer.	2003-07-29

I'm a huge fan of \\"I Am Legend\\" and Mr. Matheson's short stories have always been little gems to me.  His writing style and imaginative ideas in a haunted house setting would seem ideal, but the beginning chapters of the book were fairly boring.<br />I suppose I'm used to being creeped out in the first fifty pages, or perhaps I prefer more feelings of dread and anxiety, but after the first hundred pages I kept wondering if I was ever going to get a real fright.<br />Good thing I hung in there.  The book started scaring ... me at about two-thirds in and didn't relent.  The turning point was more overt interactions of the house with the guests, and the misdirection working to unseat sanity from their minds.<br />Now, as compared to some real page-turning horror novels, this one stands as a very good effort with some flaws.  Dialogue, some characterizations, some plot devices didn't work as well as I expected.  Still, putting it in its place among novels along a timeline, it is a solid novel and it will deliver if you hang in there.<br />However, it does not surpass \\"Salem's Lot\\" or \\"It\\" from Stephen King for pure \\"how the heck am I gonna get to sleep tonight?\\" anxiety.  It does edge out \\"The Shining\\", however, and here's an interesting final thought: what if Stanley Kubrick made this book into a movie instead of \\"The Shining\\"?  I think it might've been the most lethal film ever made...	2003-06-02

There's something mildly comforting about a new<br />Burke novel, because you should know what you're buying by now.<br />A twist on the hardboiled detective, an antihero with a heart<br />of pyrite, a hard exterior protecting a tough interior protecting<br />a broken inner child.<br />I've been in on the Burke novels since the first one, Flood,<br />was dropped in my lap.  I kinda liked the half-assed detective<br />character, and I was willing to go along with Vachss' evolution<br />of the character and his environment, but this novel represents<br />a definitive \\"mining of the old\\".<br />It's just short of becoming a parody of itself, and I don't<br />like it.  Vachss has stripped down his usual dialogue and<br />character interactions down to the bone; it's really as if he's<br />now writing these novels from a template, where he plugs in<br />the scenario and picks from the usual menu of plot devices.<br />Perhaps I'm simply tired of Burke's world.  The Prof's rhyming<br />is truly awful now, and I no longer find it a simple thing to<br />suspend disbelief during most of the book.  I think the only<br />character preserved from my broad brush happens to be Max,<br />and I suspect it's partly because he doesn't speak, but mostly,<br />because Vachss now treats him as a deus ex machina and as such,<br />he's mostly an object rather than a person.<br />&lt;sigh> I know this is not good news for loyal readers.  However,<br />I have to write 'em like I see 'em, and this world has run its<br />course.  Perhaps Vachss will take some time off, re-examine<br />where Burke is and where should be, and come up with something<br />fresh.  He needs it.	2003-05-01

Using Stew Smith's excellent examples in his Navy SEAL Fitness Guide (ISBN 1578260981) as illustrative examples, this book will assist new instructors in teaching comprehensive, total body fitness performance.<br />While it doesn't serve as a traditional textbook with 500+ pages and an extensive bibliographic stew, it does have uniquely qualified and credentialed authors contributing key chapters throughout, making this a terrific reference guide and course builder for any new instructor or instructor looking for new direction.<br />I have two criticisms, minor and not enough to reduce the star ratings.<br />One, there should be at least two more pages of material in the estimation of VO2(max) for trainees.  What is written can be figured out, but it can be re-written for clarity, and given two more pages, it can be broken down a little more to see the numbers transform.<br />Two, the typesetting is terrific for handouts, but the layout breaks across page boundaries in weird places.  This is, after all, printed matter bound for publication and distribution to the public as a book.  It should be laid out like a training manual with better formatting and page breaks, and given a keyword index at the back of the book.<br />In all, this is a very helpful guide for PE instructors of all kinds.  While its basis is primarily for training SEAL teams, there is wide appeal to any athlete looking for a disciplined, scientific approach to realizing one's full potential.	2002-12-31

You can ask me to suspend my disbelief, and I'll do so willingly if you promise not to abuse the privilege.<br />So, of course, Mr. Hunter performs some minor transgressions against me and mine with unbelievable events, some bad narrative, and comic-book characterizations.<br />Yeah, like I really cared.<br />Mr. Hunter propels a reader through a book, much like Johnny Woo will propel a moviegoer through one of his hyperkinetic-fully-automatic-gun-battle flicks. You want action? All right, let's set up our protagonist being chased by armed men and hunting dogs. Not tough enough for you? All right, he's not allowed to kill any of the men. Still not tough enough for you? He's shepherding a city-bred lawyer through it all.<br />Sounds sketchy, but Mr. Hunter pulls it off, and you're hooked, you're deliberately slowing yourself down because you feel yourself itching, running past paragraphs because you have to know how it turns out. This is a book for action fans.<br />When I read a book like this, I have one prevailing thought running through my head: this would make a [good] movie. I don't think it's an accident that his action novels are that visual and descriptive: he's a film critic and obviously a fan of Audie Murphy, old Westerns, and hard-boiled movie action.<br />I took great pleasure it reading the book, and enjoying the slower sections, if only to catch my mental breath and savor what I knew to be a grand finale. Over the top finale? Perhaps, but you be the judge of its payoff.	2002-12-16

I read nothing from Mailer prior to this book, and I needed something to occupy several hours of travel in Europe.  Over 800 pages of prose would do the trick.<br />I ended up reading the book in the hotel, four hours at a stretch.  I was fascinated by it, particularly in seeing so many familiar literary devices originate with this novel.  The backstories of the characters were excellent, and I found it to be a compact way of developing the characters and explaining  their motivations.<br />What I particularly liked was the writing style, and the Lieutenant-General struggle was perhaps the real soul of the book.  The self-awareness of each competitor, and the misconception of what each was trying to accomplish, was a microcosm of each struggle throughout the book.  Every point of conflict was sharply defined through a misunderstanding, a lack of communication, a little misstep here or there, compounding to some surprising and gut wrenching conclusions.<br />Because the ending was frustrating to me, I found it completely believable and realistic.  I can see someone stumbling into a victory; I can see our hero dying due to betrayal; and I can see the flawed, vaguely malignant leader emerge largely unscathed from the chaos.<br />...I can understand the reservations of some reviewers, but only in an abstract, \\"right to your opinion\\" sort of way.  For me, this was a 4.5 on a 5-star scale.  The only reservation was the self-censoring of certain words and phrases to pass editorial review, something I feel should not be an author's consideration when writing.  I can forgive this weakness in a 25 year old Norman Mailer, however.  He's certainly earned it.	2002-10-29

So *this* is the best-of-genre, best-of-author novel, correct?<br />I'm not impressed.  I'm disappointed, actually, and so thoroughly frustrated by two rampant flaws in Ludlum's work that I found it hard to finish the book.<br />One, Ludlum has constructed a plot with so many poor and impossible devices that I now see why the genre had acquired a bad name.  *This* novel may be the progenitor of all bad cliches for spy thrillers; if not, it certainly represents the pinnacle of achievement.  Example: the protagonist's companion has an omniscient ability to root out the intent of the US government; more likely, Ludlum found no way to tie in his loose threads other than to make her a forensic genius.  Or: the convenience of all encounters working to our protagonist's advantage.  The general who sees something trustworthy in his face, the woman who sees something courageous in his actions, neither holding any grudges or connecting past behaviour to the present.  Can you say &quot;inconsistent&quot;?<br />The characters are unbelievable.  It's as if I'm reading a parody, but since it's played straight, it's even worse.  For Ludlum to play off these ridiculous characterizations, his tongue would have to be *through* his cheek and not in it.<br />Two, and this is by far the most egregious, is that this novel was far, far longer than it needed to be.  The pacing is uneven; the beginning was hyper and subsequently, all chapters seem subdued in comparison.  However, the necessary buildup for the next part of the roller coaster is wholly inadequate.  And the complexity of the plot is unbelievable, both in scope and execution.  There's a secret government agency, but it's imbued with good people; there's a secret assassination cartel, but it has admirable ethics; the protagonist just happens to hook up with a beautiful woman who falls in love with him - loves him! - in a matter of a few weeks; the protagonist consistently outwits a professional killer, apparently just by going to school for it.<br />Oh, would that I could get back the time spent in reading this thing.  The reviews for this book serve as poor indicators of what's to be found; let this sacrificial review be a warning to readers of Andrew Vachss, Stephen Hunter, even Tom Clancy.

However, it was only available to honors students, and that's a shame.<br />The real shame is that this book might force you to realize that you hold conflicting views in your head.  I would instinctively recall the myth of a historical person or event, even though I can also recall the advanced coursework of high school and college that directly contradicts it.  Testimony, then, to how deeply ingrained bad history instruction can be.<br />This is a well-written, extremely interesting book for amateur historians and non-fiction readers alike.  If you like a good story, you'll be pleasantly surprised to read some real history, backed by copious notes and references, that will intrigue you and keep you hooked.  I always thought history was the best collection of stories one could read, and Loewen proves it demonstrably.<br />There are some heartbreaking realizations throughout the book.  Even though Loewen does a fair job of balancing the attack and reminding readers that the purpose of a democracy is to cultivate a society of bull detectors, the litany of inaccuracies and outright misrepresentations will surprise you.<br />The true heartbreak is the discussion about how textbooks are approved; never again can I stand idly by in my community, allowing such ignorant people the ability to change history to suit their prejudices.  If anything, this book has reminded me of a long-forgotten duty to speak up.	2002-05-29

I am surprised at how bad this book really is, especially in light of its overwhelmingly positive reviews.<br />Let me start in with the publisher.<br />The type is extremely hard to read (not small, just not a font conducive to easily-focused letters), and the book has misspellings in it. The book is 16 years old, did it have to ship with misspellings? Or misprints? There's at least one instance where a word is missing a letter *between two others*.<br />Aside from that, the writing is amateurish. The dialog is unnatural and stilted; real people don't sound like this. The character development is laughable. Mr. Vance apparently only invested any meaningful time in developing the Corbett character, and calling even that \\"developing a character\\" was a generous.<br />He's got plot lines all over the place and instead of tying them up neatly, he lets them scatter and thread all over the place. I consider myself pretty sharp and with a good memory for details, but I was taxed to keep up with following the action.<br />And the action! Man, I spent twenty bucks on action that isn't believable to anyone with a high school diploma. I waited over 250 pages for something good to happen, and when I got to the \\"Die Hard\\" section, I was let down completely.<br />Mr. Vance needed an editor in the worst way, and didn't get one. The result is a terrible horror novel, and while the ideas are worthy of development, they were shaped with the wrong hands.<br />Don't buy the book. In fact, if you get a copy from the library, make sure you return it on time. It isn't worth a dime in late fees, either.	2002-03-26

I read a fair amount of historical non-fiction and was taught throughout high school to think critically when reading.  Check sources, check author's tone, point of the writing, points of view being used, context, and so forth.  Apparently Mark Bowden, the author, comes from the same school of thought.  He writes a  thorough and genuine account of a sadly-ignored incident in US history.<br />I can recall the newspaper accounts of the time, wondering what we were doing there and why, after taking such incredible beatings, we were leaving.  Rather than do the research to find out why, Mr. Bowden has compiled this book, which rightfully deserves its place on any historian's bookshelf.<br />Bowden's accounting of the events and context are flawless.  His research is uncommonly thorough, and given the opportunity to write the first really comprehensive accounting of the events, he makes the most of it.  His attention to detail, his recreation of the timeline, and his notes are worthy of emulation by future students of history.<br />All that is nothing without good writing, and Bowden keeps a reader locked into the story.  As hard as some of it is to read because of the imagery and concomitant emotional responses, Bowden leads you through the battles at ground level, at eye level from helicopter platforms, at screen level from command centers.  At the end of the book one wonders how you survive the reading; how much worse to have been there in it?  I was exhausted mentally, and therein lies the demanding aspect of the book.<br />So much goes on, so many players become involved, that a cheet sheet and glossary of some terms would've helped immensely.  Even a cast of characters would've been of some utility, but eventually, I just bore down and focused.  Some questions were answered in the notes, others reveal their answers upon later reflection.<br />In all, I daresay adding my review to the nearly 400 others won't make someone any more inclined to buy a 5-star book if they've ignored the other 399 reviewers, but this is my review and I'm sticking to it.y've ignored the other 399 reviewers, but this is my review and I'm sticking to it.	2002-03-15

I've never even seen a Haynes manual in a parts store, and the one I did see at a friend's garage really didn't impress me.<br />Chilton has exploded diagrams and some good photos that really help with walking through most procedures. It's still the first thing I buy after acquiring a new (to me) set of wheels, along with all the usual and sundry tuneup parts.<br />However, I would suggest holding out on buying anything *new* from Chilton. In this day and age, you should be able to buy a CD/ book bundle for $(...). Furthermore, there should be more detailed exploded diagrams of parts and module assemblies, especially in complex processes like timing belt operations.<br />Specifically, adjusting a window is a fairly simple operation, but Chilton never tells you which direction to turn the regulators. That's a little bit of trial-and-error you might avoid with a little extra text and a much better drawing of a raw door.<br />Finally, Chilton does a disservice to folks who want to recharge their AC systems. They rightly claim that AC work needs to be done by a licensed tech, but recharging a system isn't really something you need full licensing to perform. And helpful diagnostics like adding dye to the system can really save time when it comes to doing a repair.<br />So, in conclusion, it's the standard for repair manuals, but the content and delivery of media has not kept up with technology and there are still some omissions of procedures and diagrammatic instructions that should never happen.	2001-10-22

All right, out of the box, knowing nothing about Brazil, I'd toss five stars on it in a second. However, just got back from a honeymoon with wife, who is Brazilian, and we take exception to some things:<br />Fortaleza: Imperial Othon rooms are not 5-star, but the service and staff are. Make that known.  Its location is ideal, but better rooms can be had at the Melia Confort (not a misspell).<br />Also, add Al Mare as an excellent dinner choice; right on the shoreline, superb food and service, and very cheap if you're used to paying $80 USD for this kind of meal.<br />Recife: hated it. Boa Viagem beach near Holiday Inn was so-so.  The Holiday Inn had clueless staff, cheerfully unhelpful.  Worst was Patio de São Pedro: don't go, don't even bother, unless your idea of fun happens to be a flea market in Newark.  Some heads-up on dining: liked the Flaminggo (not a misspell) on Boa Viagem, but inexplicably had no soccer telecast for the sub-17 game against France; did not like Bargaço, which attempted to foist a classy veneer on sub-par dinner offerings, and the prices were disparate with the food as well.<br />Rio: fave city, but does any hotel staff know their city outside of Fortaleza? The Everest Rio is a decent 5-star hotel if you imagine it 10 years ago. At least they had 24-hr room service.<br />Prices do change, but the LP doesn't generally steer you wrong. A guide needs more updates, however, and the 5th edition was too long in coming for me to grant a fifth star.  One final suggestion: my travel style is generally fearless but I like a good hotel and can pay for a good meal, so list some &quot;non-backpacking&quot; alternatives to places to stay and eat and see.	2001-10-02

The combination didn't disappoint me<br />then; news of a reissue means I don't have to risk opening<br />my original to re-read a classic.<br />About the novel itself, I can only agree that as a story Miller<br />has written better, but placed in its context I believe it's<br />worthy of special merit. And again, to amplify earlier<br />comments, Bill Sienkiewicz does something in this book that<br />shook comic artists at the time, breaking huge ground for<br />those that followed, and then... nothing.

Yes, I've finally read all three and I'm relieved. It was a test of fortitude to look past the filler introductory chapters, the poor dialogue, the tendencies to overexplain, the weak character development, and focus on the story itself, which was its usual addictive self. Great story. Each review I've written for each book says &quot;great story&quot;. I wondered why my reviews were so similar, then it occured to me that this trilogy should've been a single book. Cut out the filler, move the story along a little faster, and there's no time to focus on the weaker aspects. Yep, a good editor would've gotten this trilogy another star. I will admit to one shining moment: our protagonist's final encounter made me smile, as it is probably a dream encounter that many of us wish to occur. My advice, ultimately, is to buy them used or check them out at the library. They're not worth the frustration.	2001-08-25

The sheer volume of research and the magnitude and breadth of the story's scope are impressive, and the plot devices and twists are creative and entertaining. Surely, the premise has been done before but perhaps never as ambitiously or completely discussed since the Greatest Story Ever Told. It's just that BeauSeigneur isn't a fiction writer, really. His characters lack depth, his dialogue is contrived and lacks a normal conversational flow present in much better writers. I keep thinking as I read this, that if BeauSeigneur just plopped his notes and research on Stephen King's lap and said, &quot;make this work&quot;, we'd have three (or if you know King, six) marvelous books of well-written prose *and* some really creative twists. It's certainly far-reaching in its scope, but I don't think this former speechwriter was up to the task of writing it down. Given the other reviews, I'd say my opinion is unpopular, but I'd do readers a disservice by offering fake praise.	2001-08-19

You don't need<br />to know, in so much depth, how stretching works unless you're a<br />medical student.<br />The rest of book is tantalizingly close to giving you a<br />stretching routine you can adapt, but fails to do bring you<br />to a worksheet or methodology.  Kurz gives four sample regimens<br />for stretching but does not delineate a complete routine using<br />all four methods.<br />There are some routines near the end of the book that purport to be sport-specific. A better version of this book would show all the stretches, in the order you might perform them (especially in grouping them), and then charting sports and the stretches that might benefit the most.<br />Three stars for potential and content. A solid rewrite could put<br />this book over the top. And I can't understand the five-star<br />reviews of this book, but my guess is a good mix of genetics and<br />luck, plus no exposure whatsoever to a disciplined approach to<br />stretching, might explain it.<br />I'd recommend it for folks who have never approached stretching<br />in a disciplined manner before, or have not had good instruction<br />in training methods that use stretching.	2001-08-01

People need to know some things about Brian Lumley's writing in general, and this series in particular.<br />My firm belief is that the idea had gone as far as it should have with the first three books.  Of the subsequent novels, there's perhaps two good novels of material spread over about six books, more or less.<br />My advice is to get the first three, and then buy used copies of any others.  After awhile, Lumley's egregious use of exclamation points wears on a reader.  And, honestly, the ideas are better than his execution at times.<br />However, the *ideas* are incredibly good, and really, the first three books are excellent diversions and good reads.  Not strictly &quot;horror&quot;- this isn't scary like Salem's Lot is scary- but if you made the first book into a movie, you'd probably have a box office hit grossing $100 million.	2001-05-20

I think some reviewers forget that this book is 22 years old; most of what is digested and processed back to current readers of Black Belt magazine or any later kicking/ stretching manuals was found here first.<br />You have to acknowledge a debt to James Lew's effort to bring these techniques to the general public.  22 years ago, this information wasn't easy to find in one place.

Comment about previous reviews: there are ample warnings in the book about resting between sets (Lt. Smith does make recommendations but also tells readers to take as much time as they need); Lt. Smith gives the reader *choices* and *alternatives* frequently; the only point without compromise is showing up and giving a full effort.  I think that's the strongest part of the book.<br />The other reviews that augment the warnings in the book are dead-on.  These workouts are serious challenges to anyone, triathletes and boxers included.  Having said that, it's possibly the best workout you can do without weights.<br />If you can't pass the initial test and the 4 week beginner program is still too hard, halve it (make it 8 weeks, do half the work the first 4 weeks and take a week of active 'rest').<br />Overall, Lt. Smith sets a high standard for fitness with these workouts, but after reading other reviews, I bought it and will tell you myself: he lays out more than one map to these lofty goals, and his writing encourages you to try and keep trying.  I found that to be the difference between this book and any other fitness book.  I came away inspired, not intimidated.	2001-04-30

There is nothing written about how the solution actually worked in reality, so the reader is left to wonder if the dopey tips or solutions were of any use or not.<br />If I wrote this, I'd be embarassed.

Yes, another overwhelmingly positive review for this course.  It's not a plot; it's just true.  This is an effective course, a bargain at twice the price.<br />The mere fact that it ships with 12 cassettes should be your first clue that it's different from other courses.  Opening the book and seeing that the first five or eight chapters are really just basic drills and little vocabulary should be your next clue.<br />Learning a new language, for some of us, is hard.  This course breaks it down into mastering sounds first, then mastering words and flow, then learning vocabulary, then learning (a little) grammar.<br />It teaches your ear to 'hear' Brazilian Portuguese, and that I think is the ultimate arbiter between this and any other course; what good is a language that you can speak but not understand?<br />I've owned shorter courses, different courses, computer-based courses, but nothing beats the comprehensive approach of an FSI course.  This is easily the best Brazilian Portuguese course I've experienced; the fact that I'm from Newark and can get praise from Brazilians on my pronounciation and grammar should be proof enough.	2001-03-22

Yes, it is a basic intro to Portuguese, Brazilian style. However, if you are learning a language for the first time, it's usually good to warm up with the phoenetics first.  This book doesn't, and as such is a poor first start.<br />This book/ cassette combo starts off with the usual simple phrases and such, but neglects a solid tutorial in pronouncing dipthongs.  For those of you who know or are learning Portuguese, you can relate: it isn't easy mastering the pronunciation of 'não', for example.  Having a native speaker pronounce the alphabet and some sample dipthongs would've helped (forget the alphabet, they don't pronounce it at all).<br />So, what happens is that you start off with &quot;Good Morning&quot; (Bom dia) and a handful of pages later, are expected to pronounce &quot;O senhor, pode dizer-me, onde fica ha um bom restaurante?&quot; with the rapidity and skill of a native.  Nevermind that it doesn't slow down or break it into phrases.<br />If you bought it and thought, &quot;I must be stupid or something&quot;, you're not alone and you are definitely not stupid.  I handed this to a native speaker with Brazilian fluency, and she agreed that the pacing was bizarre and unfair.<br />This book/ cassette combination would probably be helpful to someone learning the language already, who might want to get a crash course in before going on a trip.<br />A much better buy is the Foreign Service tapes, which take you from a pure beginner and drill you constantly on pronunciation and grammar.  After only two tapes, my pronunciation was considered very good by native speakers, and my functional vocabulary skyrocketed.	2001-02-24
