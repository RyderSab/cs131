This new edition includes a scarcely modified version of Mr. Schneider's original text, which was direct, accurate and detailed. No problem there. No need for a new edition, but I know how the publishing industry works and am aware, also, of the sense that some readers have that everything needs to be \\"updated\\" every year or two. Well, the Guadalupe Reef and the caves under it have not changed very much since the mid-90's. Nor have the trails. So the author's text stands at five star level. Here are the changes you will see in the \\"current\\" book, leading me to give it four stars rather than the five I gave the 1996 edition:<br /><br />1) The 1996 edition had legible photocopies of the appropriate sections of the detailed Trails Illustrated topographic maps for each hike. The new edition has only very rough \\"contour\\" maps, with each contour corresponding to about a thousand feet. I don't know for sure because they're not labelled. They look sort of like those old wooden plate relief maps Scouts made for merit badges, sometimes seen in museums in visitor centers. The new maps also lack the trail mileages the T.I. maps had.<br /><br />2) The graphs that charted elevation change on the hike, mile by mile, have been eliminated.<br /><br />3) Also, the summary of elevation change over the course of the hike at the beginning of each hike description have been eliminated as well.<br /><br />These are the substantive changes. Mr. Schneider's original text, pretty much intact, mentions elevation change at various points so information relating to that aspect is not missing altogether. But I now have to recommend that users of this book ALSO buy the Trails Illustrated maps of these parks.<br /><br />Other changes don't matter so much. The first edition carried a two page piece called \\"the Grand Creation\\", about the formation of the caves in the Guadalupe Reef. This was an extract from \\"Silent Chambers, Timeless Beauty\\". Now's its gone. But it was just extra weight on the trail, anyway. But you know, I think the NEW edition is heavier!<br /><br />Finally, not that it matters, and I'm sure that the mistake is not Bill Schneider's, rather that of the person doing graphics for Globe Pequot Press, the photograph on the cover was NOT taken in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park, but in Big Bend National Park, I think from the Lost Mine Trail. At least they got the state right.<br /><br />You're better off with the old edition, but this one will do if you can't get it.<br /><br />By the way, here's a tip not in the book: Mr. Schneider makes reference to the particular beauty of the Guadalupe Ridge Trail in the early morning; this trail starts on the Scenic Loop Drive in Carlsbad Caverns NP. Keep in mind that the Scenic Loop Drive is GATED, and is not opened till some time between 7 and 8 o'clock. At least when I visited in late 2004. So if you want to get out there early, inquire with the National Park Service ahead of time.ion\\", about the formation of the caves in the Guadalupe Reef.

This edition, stemming from the time when learning a modern foreign language was still modeled after the traditional procedures employed by dons and thwackum-style masters in beating Latin or Greek into their charges' heads, presents a full and fair text of Lazaro, modernizing and regularizing the spelling, but changing the original in no other way that I can detect. The editors added a FULL vocabulary of the work, including even the most basic words, so that a beginner with a basic knowledge of the grammar could conceivably get through it, though it seems to me that any student should become reasonably comfortable with modern standard Spanish before they tackle something like Lazaro, direct as the Castillian literary style may have been in those days.<br /><br />My criticism of this edition relates to confusion of the function of notes and vocabulary. There are lines and lines of notes at the bottom of each page, but the student will find that a very large part of this material is nothing more than the schoolmaster's instructions to the little brigands, who would really rather be carving up the desks, as to the elegant phraseology they should employ in manufacturing a finished translation: \\"translate as pluperfect\\", \\" 'since he had gotten a cold deal on a cold turnip'\\" etc etc etc. Explanations of historical and cultural information, giving the student something of the background the Spanish contemporary would have brought to the text would have been more helpful. And in fact, the editors do include some of this sort of stuff, but it's back in the vocabulary, along with entries such as \\"cumplir - to obey, comply with, behoove etc\\", and extremely limited.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a mass of annotations that will explain what went into each episode and line of Lazaro, this isn't it. But at least it's an unadulterated text of a book that was terribly important in Spain, and, by some extension, the world. And people still read it. Both scholars and schoolchildren, when they aren't carving on desks (or whatever they do these days).they aren't carving on desks (or whatever they do these days).	2005-09-13

T. I. has dispensed with the atmospheric colorizing overwash used in some earlier maps in the series, leaving us with a map that is easier to read. Important in an area where you need to be VERY precise about the lay of the land. Elevation change here is not great, but abrupt and hard to predict. Instincts and expectations that have worked elsewhere might not work here. Use a compass. (If you use one of those GPS devices, make sure it doesn't beep. Bugs the buffalo and old-timers like me.)<br /><br />Both the older \\"Badlands Nat'l Monument\\" area in the north and the less-visited southern additions co-managed with the Pine Ridge Indian reservation are included on the two sides of this tear-resistant map (using some sort of plasticized material that has fortunately become common in maps in the last years).<br /><br />If the Badlands fascinate you, you'll be tempted to charge off cross-country, as there aren't many maintained trails away from the visitor center at Interior. Don't go far without this map or a USGS topo. (Or your beeping gizmo.)<br /><br />If you don't want to deal with secondary sellers off Amazon, you may want to contact the Badlands Natural History Association in Interior SD. They carry the map and are pleasant to deal with.	2005-08-23

Reproduction quality isn't high, but is frequently sufficient for the purpose. The Geldart's book has only handdrawn schematic maps.<br /><br />2) \\"Exploring the Black Hills & Badlands\\" has more material. As you can see from the info provided by Amazon, there are more pages, but this understates how much further Rogers goes. Descriptions of particular trails are a bit more detailed, usually, and there is more historical and natural history material given in most cases. You will find more material, especially, on the Badlands (eg. a section on off-trail travel in the Sage Creek Wilderness).<br /><br />The Geldarts do touch on locales and details not mentioned in Hiram Rogers' book, so those planning to spend any appreciable time in the area might want to get both.<br /><br />I see that there appear to be restrictions in availability through Amazon as I type this. If you aren't comfortable dealing with secondary dealers, I would note that I saw new copies of Rogers' book in the bookstores at Wind Cave National Park and elsewhere. Try the websites for WCNP, the Badlands NP or Custer State Park.	2005-08-23

But I base my harsh judgment specifically on his remarks about gestures in Greece. I've spent enough time, the better part of a year, in Greece to have my own ideas about it, and in fact, I was there around the time he published this book. Some quite prominent gestures, differing from the Anglo-American lot, are left unnoted, and others are mis-interpreted. I don't believe he did any \\"research\\" in Greece. Was he even there?<br /><br />In another of his books, he states authoritatively that men who are attracted to women with small breasts are homosexuals, whether they want to admit it or not. What book was it, you ask? Ah, some book or other, not this one ... Some book or other, he's written ... oh, never mind.	2005-06-10

Quite a problem when you've got three to six thousand feet of elevation change over only a few miles, or just one mile. I don't know what they meant to do with the shading. Impress the user with the idea that this is mountainous country? People, this is a topographic map! We know how, or don't know how, to read the elevation intervals. Using shading appropriate to a desk atlas of countries and continents is NOT appropriate here.<br /><br />There are no trail mileages printed along the trails. Or elsewhere on the map. NG indicates the mileages on their more recent maps.<br /><br />There is a real paucity of benchmarks here, and in fact of labelling on the contours. You see the elevations in feet on the Rim points, and on the buttes, etc. in the Canyon. Not much help for hikers who are wondering how much climbing or descent they're in for on a given route.<br /><br />A lot of the data in the incidental parts on the product is not really that helpful. There are a list of \\"recommended hikes\\", depending on the user's fitness, time etc. No one needs that sort of thing on their trail map, they need hard data. Opinions about the nature of a trail should be supplied by authors of trail guidebooks or by rangers and locally experienced hikers who've had time to size YOU up.<br /><br />The whole thing's a bit surprising. I've used NG's T.I. maps elsewhere, in the Guadalupe Mountains NP, etc, and none of these inadequacies were present. They were pretty good, in fact.<br /><br />I think this is an old product. NG should get going and revise it. In the meantime I would recommend Ken Schulte's map or the standard USGS topo quadrangles. Under NO circumstances would I suggest using this map for off trail travel or even on the less well maintained trails.	2005-05-24

I don't have a copy in front of me. But it gave the clearest, best organized and most graphic overview of major trails and routes in the Grand Canyon, from Lee's Ferry downriver to the Hualapai Rez of all the books I consulted. There are photocopies of topographic maps along with plain and concise descriptions of the nature and history of each trail. If you can get a copy, just keep in mind that<br /><br />A) access issues have changed, in a number of places*, and<br /><br />B) the author assumes top fitness in the reader, and some willingness to scramble, if not actually downclimb. So, be realistic about your own abilities.<br /><br />*PS of 2013: changes have been particularly drastic in the Hualapai Rez; this area has been, for some time, all but off-limits for anyone other than those engaged in major money making. Check the author's description and wish it were otherwise.	2005-05-05

If only I were familiar enough with the northern parts of this extraordinary state to judge whether the hikes he describes are really the best you can take!<br /><br />I would make two minor criticisms, and I expect they reflect on editors and publisher, rather than the author:<br /><br />1) the maps are not copies or reductions of topographic maps, but simple, somewhat schematic sketches. Keep in mind that you need to refer to his texts, which are pretty detailed, when in doubt, and that you may want to supplement the book with topographic or other maps of a given area.<br /><br />2) this book covers northern Arizona EXCEPT for the trails in the Grand Canyon system. There is nothing wrong with that, in fact I think it was a good idea, as there is a lot of documentation on trails and routes in the Grand Canyon National Park and associated areas elsewhere. But why wasn't this made clear in a subtitle?<br /><br />Of the several works I've seen on this subject, this seemed the most compact and up-to-date. But looking through the others will be worth your time, so put your local library to the test. See if you can get them to \\"interlibrary loan\\" all the stuff out there (maybe if you're lucky enough to live in AZ, they'll have it anyway). Don't let those people get away with buying pop fiction, running homeless citizens out, and fretting & re-fretting about color schemes. Make them help you decide which books you're going to spend your money on. Hey, and what are you going to do about those books that are \\"out of print\\". Make them find a library that hasn't \\"weeded\\" those books yet.	2005-04-28

OK for places nearby but what about those trips across the continent? This book gave me everything I needed to get the most out of my brief week in the Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad Caverns National Parks, places I rather suspect I'll never get to again.<br /><br />The author covers all the maintained trails (and some that aren't, really) that I've heard of, with fairly good detail and guidance as to difficulty. He is clearly a champion hiker himself but no need to fear that you'll be dragged along by hiker machismo: he over-, rather than underrates the difficulty of these trails. But he also gives you all the information you'll need to go bounding out on your own over-demanding marches. For example, I took his day hike out of Dog Canyon up to Lost Peak, then continued along the McKittrick Ridge Trail out to the \\"snout\\", just before the plunge down to McKittrick Canyon. Not something he recommended, but I had all the data I needed to make my own decision.<br /><br />The maps are photocopies of the National Geographic maps of these parks, available at their website for about 10 bucks as well as the visitor centers in Carlsbad Caverns & Guadalupe Mountains NP's. Aesthetically, they are perhaps a bit lacking but I found them perfectly readable for the purpose of trail use. You might want to supplement them for bushwhacking, though.<br /><br />I used this book in October of 2004 and found no pressing need for revision, though of course I didn't hike all the trails, just a lot of them.<br /><br />I mentioned the Internet at the outset. This wonderful area does not excite the interest, as measured by internet postings, that such places as the Grand Canyon do. There is a Yahoo group, but there is just not much activity on it.

I'll take their word for it. One might say, briefly and without likely challenge, that Lazarillo de Tormes doesn't get far beyond its chapbook origins, whereas Quevedo's work is far more sophisticated, though it shows the sophistication of a \\"slummer\\".<br /><br />These books are a lot of fun to read, if you enjoy fast comic action with flashes of pathos, and can stand some coarseness and brutality mixed in. Well, not just some perhaps. Say a lot. Welcome to Spain in the 1500's. Welcome to Planet Earth.<br /><br />The translation is excellent standard English, not quite the colloquial, which would be an affectation, under the circumstances.<br /><br />Students of Spanish might well want to try \\"Lazarillo\\" in Spanish. It's surprisingly un-difficult for the motivated intermediate student. There have been several annotated editions for English speakers over the years.<br /><br />What a scary and wonderful country Spain has been, ever since the Romans incited war against Carthage by drawing a line in it. And still is. Thanks, Spaniards, for throwing out your stupid government that kow-towed to the American warmongerers.	2005-03-02

An innovation I would like to see picked up by other compilers of such works, as it seems to me distracting to have text and translation within eyeshot of each other.<br /><br />Both the English and Spanish texts are written in a straightforward style, poetic in the manner of oral lore. The Spanish was direct enough to be comprehensible to this non-native speaker. How far it corresponds to the actual speech of representative tellers I cannot judge.<br /><br />My only criticism would be the lack of notes, unfortunately common enough in popular publishings of folklore (but good grief, this is produced by the \\"Museum of New Mexico Press\\"!). Folklore arises from a people who have their own assumptions and idiosyncracies, and to the shame of America, this culture, whose antecedents predate much of the European invasion, is not well known away from the immediate locality. Further, many of these tales occur in many significant variants. For example, dig about in collections of Southwest Hispanic or Mexican folklore, and you will encounter many radically different takes on La Llorona, the Weeping Woman. The text included in this book is more or less suitable for reading before mixed company, but some of the others, wow!<br /><br />Over the whole, though, an enjoyable and edifying book.	2004-12-20

Readers should keep in mind, though, that in this book Buber was using traditional Ashkenazic pietism to represent a more cosmopolitan and higher reality. When he composed this book, there was every reason to believe that the Hasidim who survived the genocide perpetrated by National Socialism would fall prey to Communism or, more slowly, to secular education and one or another form of democracy. Hence sentimentality led Buber to transfigure Khasiduth into something as etherialized as Platonism or his ally Paul Tillich's Protestantism.<br />History has astonished us. Hasidic courts of one kind or another are common in America and Israel and may even be encountered in Europe. It is a reality, not just a historical memory.<br />This reality in its folkloric aspect may be found, at least for the Hebrewless reader, in Jerome Mintz' &quot;Legends of the Hasidim : an introduction to Hasidic culture and oral tradition in the New World&quot;, published by the University of Chicago Press. Unlike Buber, Mintz is a professional folklorist and not only presents the tales in their veritable form but fully contextualizes them by informant, court, place and time, with other cultural information supplied as appropriate.<br />Readers of Mintz' book will experience Hasidic folklore in its present variety and become acquainted with the bigotry, ignorance, viciousness and pomposity found among the Hasidim just as they are in most living religions. Folklore, like religion, is not just a vehicle for a particular individual's view of the universe but an intimate part of some real sociology, lived by some real people in some real context. Mintz gives us a picture of Khasiduth which the great Buber in his goodness and humanity could not.	2004-04-02

These were short music videos customers could play in kiosks for a nickel, popular in the early Forties. Duke made several. You can see an example or two in the Smithsonian's Museum of American History, and read how they fit into the music industry in this book.<br /><br />Did you know that Billie Holiday made a movie with Ellington in 1935? This was the \\"Symphony in Black\\", one of the first artefacts of American pop culture to suggest that Black artistic endeavor might be worthy of attention or even romanticizing.<br /><br />In addition to the films, the author has documented all of Ellington's performances, in New York and every small burg across America and abroad, not just those which were recorded, thereby filling in the gaps between the dates found in Timner's Ellingtonia and the multi-volume Italian work D.E.S.O.R. The entirety has been annotated with extracts from contemporary media as well as the author's own assessments of the performance's significance in the short and long term. Ellington's business activity and the comings and goings of major and subbing musicians are traced daily, sometimes from morning to evening. Particular compositions and recordings are contextualized with a thoroughness I have not seen previously and it becomes possible to sense what Ellington's music meant to the average listener, in Harlem or elsewhere.<br /><br />This work should be of great value not only to Ellington enthusiasts, but anyone seriously interested in a detailed look at the world of Black big band music, the popular music recording industry or mid century American popular culture. It appears to be available from Storyville Records in Denmark.<br /><br />I am not aware that anyone has written a work of \\"historical fiction\\" about Duke Ellington yet, but this work would certainly be necessary for that project.from Storyville Records in Denmark.<br /><br />I am not aware that anyone has written a work of \\"historical fiction\\" about Duke Ellington yet, but this work would certainly be necessary for that project.	2004-01-08

He was nonetheless overshadowed by his father, the great Max Weinreich, who wrote a four volume history of the language (in Yiddish, with a one-volume English abridgement) and who started the massive Yiddish-Yiddish dictionary (under the aegis of Columbia University, I think) which is still \\"under construction\\".<br /><br />There aren't many good Yiddish-English dictionaries out there. Uriel Weinreich's is one of the two I'm familiar with, the other being Alexander Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary.<br /><br />Weinreich gives good grammatical information in his entries, such as verb aspect and case of verb object, along with unpredictable forms such as the past participle. Both alphabets are very clear and distinct, and big enough to be readable for those past the bloom of youth. The English-Yiddish section is valuable for those using the book in Yiddish classes and for those who would like to speak, as well as read, Yiddish. Of course, it decreases the overall size of the dictionary, so a lot of the words you encounter won't show up in it.<br /><br />The big drawback is the work's prescriptive nature, meaning that this is how Weinreich thought Yiddish *should* be spoken and written, not how it *was* spoken and written. Critics such as Solomon Birnbaum have even claimed that Weinreich made words up, if he didn't find them ready to hand. True, new words are formed or borrowed all the time, but that's the job of writers, subject specialists, members of subcultures, teenagers, grannies, and just about everybody *but* lexicographers.<br /><br />Further, if your goal is to read classic Yiddish literature (Perets, Sholom Aleichem, Yitskhak Manger etc.), this is not the book for you. I would recommend Harkavy's dictionary, if you can find it. He doesn't give the noun genders, there is little grammatical guidance and the print is hard to read, but the word you're looking for is likely to be there. And the book's very age (1920? or somewhere along there) is a plus, for this purpose. Of course, any serious student of Yiddish needs to keep good Polish, Hebrew and other dictionaries on hand, otherwise many words will remain a mystery, whatever Yiddish dictionary is used.<br /><br />***Note (April 2013)***<br /><br />I need to:<br /><br />a) update this review a bit:<br /><br />In addition to Harkavy's Dictionary, any reader of Yiddish literature would want to consider the recent<br /><br />Arumnemik Yidish-English verterbukh /<br />Solon Beinfeld;  Harry Bochner<br />2013<br />xxxix, 704 p. ; 27 cm.<br />Bloomington, Ind. : Indiana University Press, ; ISBN: 9780253009838 0253009839<br /><br />It is an adaptation of a French original.

It's about as Chinese as a tearoom in Las Vegas but that's allright.<br /><br />This man does NOT know anything about China or Confucious. You cannot just wing it when you translate an ancient text. Even if you're blindly convinced that the text is a transcendent work of genius which would cure all the evils of the world, which is more or less the tenor of Pound's dementia when he ground out this screed.<br /><br />Use Arthur Waley's readable translation with its excellent introduction, or, for that matter, just about anything else. You'll reach a better conclusion about Confucious. Was he the sanest and most humane of all the philosophical system builders, or was he just a sententious reactionary, a lunatic to rank with all the others who thought they knew how society should be governed?	2003-06-05

Much of what Takahashi works into these episodes will be missed by many readers, especially those who have no knowledge of the Japanese language originals or limited knowledge of Japan, but open-minded graphic novel fans of any background should enjoy much that lies on the surface. This particular collection seems to be a fair compendium of her work.<br />Why only four stars? Certainly the content deserves all five. Unfortunately, the book is poorly bound, so the cover AND the pages fall out within a couple of months of normal usage. If this book is just for you, fine, but if you're buying for a library (and what graphic novel collection would NOT have Takahashi's Lum?) or like to pass your books around to friends, it's going to fall apart.<br />Not unusual for good manga, unfortunately.	2003-05-27

Egypt and Ur are not included, for some reason. Certainly the Tanakh (\\"Old Testament\\") attributes some pretty holy happenings to them. Within these chapters each place includes a brief description and a chronology of its significance in the Christian Bible, with reference limited to those aspects likely to be of interest to American fundamentalist Protestants, rather than Orthodox or Catholic brethren and sisters. The good doctor does not seek controversy in this work, however, and includes two maps with the current political boundaries clearly shown. A separate section of poor quality color photographs even has a couple of figures described as Arabs, though perhaps they are Christians, and in any case are engaged in activities such as herding sheep and winnowing grain, rather than raising Cain.<br /><br />Prefatory materials are clearly aimed at readers who have never been outside the USA, much less to the Near East, and are not bad so far as they go. Passports, jet lag and weather are covered, though the conversational Hebrew and Arabic are pretty minimal and those few travelers who aspire to talk to the locals in their own languages would be advised to supplement Dr. Dyer's jargon with tapes and phrasebooks. Most, however, will undoubtedly stay close to the bus and have no need for palaver with the natives or recent immigrants of whatever language.<br /><br />Further aids are included. There is an entire schedule of suggested objects of prayer: good attitudes, the spiritual health and destiny of the bus driver, good weather and much more are among them. Following these hints are special focal points in Bible Study, several pages in fact before the actual Guide commences. And at the end of the book are appended quite a lot of verses (not Biblical ones, but rhymed & metrical stuff), maybe for singing, though there is no musical notation.<br /><br />There are no materials on accommodations or nightlife, so the traveler will have to see to suchlike some other way. Visitors who are interested in what might have happened since \\"Biblical\\" times and are merely perplexed by the evidence they will presumably see around them may want to consider Baedekers or Blue Guides. But Dyer & Hattieburg's Guide will probably be satisfactory to the type of tourist who will buy it.f verses (not Biblical ones, but rhymed & metrical stuff), maybe for singing, though there is no musical notation.<br /><br />There are no materials on accommodations or nightlife, so the traveler will have to see to suchlike some other way.

It's an interesting part of his megalomania, and you might imagine that he uses this fantasy to justify his rampages in the same way that the Israeli settlers in the occupied territories of Palestine use the legends of Moses and Joshua to justify their murder and degradation of the Palestinians. Don't waste your money on this book. There's a minimum of information on Saddam Hussein and plenty of Dyer's usual mix of Biblical cutting & pasting and sanctification of American & Israeli power-grabbing. This is religion in the service of politics, no better than that of Osama Bin Laden. This book is a base attempt to cash in on war-fever.	2003-03-25

He explains why it is ridiculous and sacrilegious for Jews to acclaim a dead man as the Messiah in an unredeemed world. His arguments are clear and cogent, using the great Rabbinical texts, yet comprehensible to interested laypersons.<br />Rabbi Berger has limited his criticism to those elements in Lubavitch who revere the dead Rebbe as the Messiah, or even worship him as God himself. The book is in no way a general attack on Lubavitch. The vitriol heaped on the author by some signifies nothing more than reactive hysteria.<br />Those who are looking for a criticism of Lubavitch or the Ultra-Orthodox generally will not find it here.	2003-02-21

Sections such as &quot;ten reasons against war with Iraq&quot; will be of great use to those who are already persuaded of the folly and injustice of this war and would like to persuade others whose minds are still open to suasion. I would not proffer the book itself, however, at those who think that anything W. Bush says is gospel truth. Noam Chomsky, for instance, is a man of great intelligence, integrity and knowledge but he is unlikely to change anyone's mind. Readers may be able to translate his uncompromising critique into terms their next door neighbors will accept.<br />Milan Rai has done an excellent job at assembling this data and structuring it in a way that makes it usable for plain citizens. My only criticism would be its general orientation toward British readers, when the war really needs to be stopped here in America. Of course, you could easily argue that Britain (meaning Tony Blair) is the controllable vector of this plague. But I think catalyst might have been the better word, and that the reaction is unstoppable at this point	2003-02-14

Lambert didn't spend much time on Duke's personal life, talking about the man only when it was needed to explain the music. Not that there aren't some good insights into this fascinating individual here. But some readers may miss the swarm of anecdotes found in most works on Ellington.<br />Lambert follows Duke's work chronologically, alternating chapters which closely describe specific recordings with chapters discussing the development of the band more generally. The arrangement is very consistent, making it easy to find particulars on recordings, band members, etc. with a minimum of flipping about. The index is not always as useful as it should be, though.<br />The appendices give a good overview of the recorded Ellington in the pre-CD era.	2002-11-22

After some further civilized speechifying, the gentleman revealed that he served in the Emperor's air force, and would like to honor the family by inducting the youth in that organization. \\" 'Ah so', remarked my father, with carefully manufactured surprise'\\".<br /><br />  This book tells an extraordinarily convincing story of Kuwahara's experiences in boot camp and as a pilot who watched many of his friends die in the final assaults on Allied forces in the Pacific. Moreover, it contains an early description of the hellish scene after the American atomic attack on Hiroshima, where Kuwahara was spending some leave time when the bomb was dropped.<br /><br />  Readers will find that there was indeed dissent against Tokyo's war inside Japan, and in fact within the military. I read this book when I was still a child, and have ever since been proof against the Japan-baiting so common here in America.	2002-09-09

This had been one of the great selling points of the earlier editions of the University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary. In their introduction there is some explanation to the effect that tracing regional usage is \\"notoriously difficult\\". It is true that good lexicography is \\"notoriously difficult\\" and if the editors find it too difficult, they should go into another business.<br />In addition, the number of entries has been reduced. Anyone who has used a dictionary on the ground knows that smaller dictionaries are poorer dictionaries. Some of the space saved was used on parenthetical guide-words which distinguish separate meanings. This sounds like a fine idea but in practice the editors use it compulsively, in places where it really isn't necessary.<br />Those who need a Spanish dictionary may want to get the older editions of this dictionary or one of the larger editions of Larousse.	2002-09-09

The former Weiss of Austria recounts his journey as a dissatisfied journalist to Cairo, Jerusalem and Damascus, in between a picturesque narrative present of his ramblings by foot and camel between Iraq and Mecca, in the company of his kinsman-by-marriage from a local tribe. We get a vivid picture of these eloquent and hospitable people during the era of their escape from Turkish, then European imperialism, while traditional forms of life and belief were still largely untainted and unimpeached by cosmopolitanism.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Asad never makes clear why Islam was the solution to what he claims was the West's materialism and rootlessness. The very low conversion rate to Islam among Westerners, coupled with the chaos, violence and degradation characteristic of Muslim countries, whether they claim to be \\"Islamic\\" or not, suggests that submitting to Islam was a confirmation of his own emotional affinity for Muslim culture, rather than a rational choice that we also should make. And in fact, books about conversions rarely truly explain the author's thoughts and actions. How many of us who have been struck by the beauty of C.S. Lewis \\"Surprised by Joy\\" can paraphrase Lewis's reasons for his \\"conversion\\" (which was not one at all in Asad's sense). So frequently the author confuses his autobiography with an explanation for his conversion. But these books do frequently make good reading, and this one is not an exception. Unfortunately, the culture that Mr. Asad found so attractive has been transformed by oil, urbanization, \\"globalism\\", political ideologies, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Those who need more evidence of what Asad found so attractive in this region may want to read Thesiger's \\"Arabian Sands\\". Those who would like to read a more convincing account of a religious conversion may want to check out Julius Lester's \\"Lovesong : on becoming a Jew\\".ant to check out Julius Lester's \\"Lovesong : on becoming a Jew\\".	2002-08-02

The main body of the text is a chronological list of Ellington band performances (including the small ensembles under sidemen's names) which were known to have been recorded and released by somebody at sometime somewhere. The typical entry includes:<br /><br />a)title of ensemble (e.g. D.E. and his Famous Orchestra, Johnny Hodges and his Orchestra etc.),<br /><br />b)date,<br /><br />c) nature of performance (live, studio, movie sound track),<br /><br />d)musicians,<br /><br />e)place, and<br /><br />f) titles with original record label & identifying numbers. There are occasionally notes giving variant titles.<br /><br />There is also an alphabetical list of titles indicating the various recording dates and several lists and indexes of &#34;Ellingtonians&#34;, band personnel who were connected with the Ellington organization in any way, as well as lists of record labels and the various names under which Ellington recorded.<br /><br />This is entirely oriented toward identifying recordings, not compositions, so there is no composer or publishing data given. There is no interpretive or evaluative commentary.<br /><br />Keep in mind that there have been several editions, as new performances are occasionally unearthed, so this is a work in progress. For example, the fifth volume of the Duke Ellington Treasury Shows, released by Storyville in 2002, included a live performance from 1945 that I did not find in Timner.	2002-07-31
