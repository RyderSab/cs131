So many of them are about pride and vanity.  And where's the famous story of Androcles and the Lion?  I give it four stars mostly because of the large size and large print and the illustrations, all of which should be pleasing to children.  Those illustrations are wonderful.  And I liked the font, which is very old-fashioned.  This is a reprint of a book originally printed in 1914, and the publishers have kept that look.  A good buy for your children, I should think.  Children always love stories wherein animals talk, and are like people.  This is the original.  A good moral thrown in never hurts, either.  E.g., \\"A kindness is never wasted.\\"	2005-09-14

I have also read John Conington's translation, done in about 1870, but find that Dryden's much earlier one wins out. Even though it has a very outmoded rhyme scheme, so despised in today's world, it is that very rhyme scheme that literally carries you along in the reading, making it much easier. Everything is here, war, unrequited love, violence to the max, blood, gore, horrific battle scenes, slaughter unending, the human condition. Which encompasses the gods, who succumb to using mankind as chess pieces to play out their very human emotions. And how Virgil must have clearly understood the futility of war, as well as its horror - and something else - how it catches hold of man and chases away his reason. The poetry is truly soaring; many scenes are as vivid as any movie screen could make them. The pathos and poignancy are not soon forgotten.  Scenes of parents behind city walls seeing their sons shut out and killed when the gates are shut are heartwrenching. Here is an example of the power in Virgil's storytelling:<br /><br />There is this king, who was evil and a very bad ruler,(one of the things he does as punishment to citizens is to tie a living man to a dead man, face to face, and leave them together while the dead man decays) and  his people manage to throw him out. In his escape he takes with him his infant daughter, Camilla, whom he loves very much.  (It is one of the poet's strengths that no one is either all good or all bad.) They come to a raging river, and the king quickly realizes that, although he is a very strong swimmer, he cannot possibly cross with Camilla, a babe in arms. What to do? He has with him a stout lance or spear, and lashes Camilla to this. Then, using all his considerable strength, he throws the lance across the river, where it lands, quivering, with Camilla still tied safely to it. Then he swims across, retrieves his daughter, and raises her to be Camilla, the virgin warrior, who will bring acorps of other like women to the last battle. Is this the stuff of movies or what? Don't be put off by the fact that it was written over 2000 years ago. It is exciting, absorbing stuff.  And I must disagree with the majority of critics who constantly harp on the fact that Aeneas left Dido in the lurch.  Dryden's translation makes perfectly clear that he did so only at the instigation of the gods, and that inwardly his heart was breaking. He was above all else an obedient man, to his forefathers, and his fate, containing that very Roman virtue, \\"pietas\\".  Vergil captures \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\\" to a T.  A caveat - be very familiar with the story and characters of \\"The Iliad\\", from which Virgil builds \\"The Aeneid\\".<br /><br />I just roared through this when I picked it up again in 2011, and still, I absolutely love it.  Soaring poetry, parts of it make me want to weep.  How can it be so neglected now?  Must rank up there as one of my favorite all-time books.  I could read it again and again.  Where are all our heroes now?  So much gore and bloodshed.  Virgil is not stingy in describing the horrors of the battlefield.  And yet - we still war.  I fear it's like will never be seen again.	2005-09-01

But I think only a lover of Thackeray and/or that by-gone style of writing would have stuck it out.  Me, I loved it.  Thackeray's last book, and it shows, as his digressions occur on almost every page.  Lots of Latin and French phrases, not translated.  But the English class system as it was in 1860 is set forth to a tee, as is also their racial prejudice.  The portrayal of the marriage by the narrator, who is Philip's friend, was quite marvelously written.<br /><br />However, it must be stated that \\"A Shabby Genteel Story\\" was actually a novella written before \\"The Adventures of Philip\\".  It needs to be read first in order to properly appreciate the background to the story of Philip.<br /><br />Read again at the end of 2011 and I can only say \\"Lord, I love this book!\\".  Like loosing yourself in a fabulous Masterpiece Theatre series.  I'm sure I liked it even better this time, but it must be admitted that Thackeray did have it in for mixed blood.  I loved all his asides. What a marvelous series it would make, so many finely drawn characters, both Firmans, Tufton Hunt, the Twysdens, Lord Ringwood, even Pendennis and Laura, Mrs. Baynes.  When I was a child in Louisville, there was a private club called The Pendennis.  I wonder.	2005-08-30

Ordinary.  Nor suitable to the epic at all.  In retropect, I loved John Conington's verse, the rhyme scheme carried you along, and yet let in all the pathos, poignancy, and Vergil's obvious abhorence of war.  Which none of the essayists here addressed, an oversight I cannot understand, since this seems to be a major theme of the epic.  Dryden's translation was also wonderful, and perhaps a bit clearer, although that may be attributed to the fact that I had already read this book and Conington's translation.	2005-08-30

It has lost none of its power for me.  Almost a thriller.   After about halfway through, I simply couldn't put it down - again.  The two main characters, Rayber and Tarwater, mesmerizing.  But to correct a misconception - this book was published in 1960.  And since Flannery was born in 1925, she was 40 when it first came out, a matter of simple math.  Not 30, as one reviewer noted. She did not even complete the first draft until 1959. <br />About bible-belt southern poor, that, being from the South, I recognize and know.  These people are not as far-fetched as many might think.  Yet it is such an unlikely plot for such an incredible read.   <br />Flannery, a life-long staunch Catholic, is not at all satirizing here.  Quite plainly nature in the novel is used as a kind of sacrament, and Tarwater (the boy) does indeed emerge as the prophet from the wilderness (Powderhead).  She sets Rayber, the intellectual humanist and rationalist against both the Tarwaters. Rayber is total commitment to disbelief; old Tarwater a total committment to faith. In the novel, there is no middle course. But Rayber's is the way of self-deception and self-destruction according to Flannery.  In the end, he just collapses and that is all the further we hear of him. But Tarwater is given, so he comes to realize, a vision of his prophecy that he cannot deny, no matter what the cost to himself. In another time these people would not have been looked upon as freaks, mad and compulsive, certainly not in Biblical times.  <br />Rayber's love for his son just dissolves, while Tarwater's vision for his nephew, young Tarwater, takes wing.   <br />Of course, there is one staggering problem - that the boy Tarwater commits a murder on his way to salvation.  Flannery seem not to consider this as of much importance.  What exactly is Bishop to Rayber and the boy?  I'm not sure.  But I do know that this book is not easily forgotten, nor the questions it raises. Is it that Rayber, by constantly fighting against forces in himself, and thus denying his true nature, collapses, while the boy finally gives in?  Read it and ask yourself.	2005-05-17

Longer than \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and just chock full of the \\"n\\" word.  But the last pages, where Huck poses as Tom Sawyer and Tom as Sid, and they hatch plans, or rather Tom does, to free Jim from the Phelps, is flat-out hilarious.  I laughed out loud so many times.  Tom has read far too many swashbuckling adventures for his own (and Jim's) good.  Twain has amazing command of all the southern dialects, including the slave Jim's speech.  Jim may be free at the end, but sadly, his wife and children are not.  A wonderful story all around.  How much Twain loved the Missisippi is so evident in many beautiful and haunting passages of river life.  A word of advice:  you do need to read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" first.  \\"Huck Finn\\" is really a sequel, and many characters in the first book are referred to in the second. As The Great American Novel, I still think that nothing surpasses \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", but \\"Huck Finn\\" comes in at a close second.	2005-05-09

Written in 1824, Morier, an Englishman who had spent much time in Persia (Iran), writes from the viewpoint, in 1st person narrative, of Hajji Baba, his life from the beginning til he is probably in his 30's somewhere.  I wonder if present-day Iranis are anything like the Persians of only 200 years ago.  Amazingly, Morier presents their life as basically unchanged from Biblical times.  And Hajji is somewhat like the hero of \\"The Adventurer\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\" by Mika Waltari, prideful, boastful, with more than his share of vanity, and a whole lot to learn.  I do know that poetry is still extremely important in the lives of Iranis, as it was then.  I have managed to get ahold of the sequel \\"The Adventures of Hajji Baba in England\\", in which Morier pits English customs against those of Persia, poles apart.  It is amusing, and I do not think unduely slanted towards the English at all.  Just a clash of cultures, nobody right, nobody wrong.	2005-03-24

Harper's Weekly is long gone, and the tepid Time and Newsweek can not hold a candle to the coverage of that magazine.	2005-03-04

Otherwise, after 10 pages of straight reading, I was just overwhelmed with facts, figures and details, plus locations for which there was no corresponding map in the book, a real detriment, I think.  Yes, there is a map showing the areas that the various tribes inhabited, but with no relation to present day locations at all.  For the Pacific Northwest Indian student, this should definitely take a place on bookshelves as a reference tool.  But for average folk, perhaps one of the many suggested readings would be more appropriate. A great overall encyclopedia of the tribes.	2005-02-22

Always on the side of the environmentalists, I came to understand and sympathize with the loggers who cut them down.  Not an easy task for any writer to undertake.  But Dietrich has done it, and done it well. No wonder he won a Pulitzer Prize.  The writing is clear and sharp, and at times, poetic in imagery.     Yes, I have been to the Olympic old-growth forests of which he speaks, and he is right when he says that the minute you enter them, there is magic.  Even the loggers feel this. The stories of individuals, both on the side of timber and the side of trees, eloquently speak of passions and lifestyles, battles won and lost.  Anita Goos is not someone I will soon forget.  Dietrich tells of men and women who choose their battles, sometimes unwillingly, but who enter the fray with hearts and minds wholly in the cause.   <br />It is well to follow this book with \\"The Hidden Forest\\" by Jon Luoma, written seven years later.	2005-02-21

Why Watson is as old as he is is a mystery, however, as in Doyle's stories he is quite a young man, being at most no more than thirty-five, and in most of the tales, married, and living apart from Holmes.  My book had 612 pages, and a page-turner til the last.  Especially great to read over the holidays when time is at a premium, and no story is very long.  Easy to pick up and put down.

Set in Europe between 1508 and 1525, you will find yourself learning a great deal of its history while reading one terrific story.  Everything I looked up in the World Book from Waltari's portrayal was true.  I am soooo sorry to have finished it.  But good news; there is a sequel, \\"The Wanderer\\", which I immediately sought in my library, and will eagerly devour until the one I bought to set beside \\"The Adventurer\\" comes.  To be honest, for about the first one-third of the book, I thought the story only mildly disguised history, but then, wow! did it pick up.  As another reviewer has mentioned, you are always in suspense.  Why this was never made into a movie I cannot imagine, for there is certainly enough sex and violence and battle scenes for any one to relish in.  Plus all the costume drama in the world.  I can't wait to start the sequel.  Waltari shows a very compassionate nature here, somehow making the priests who ran the Inquisition into understandable figures, no mean feat.  And Michael, basically a real blockhead who would have perished long ago without Andy.  All in all, I felt I have spent time in the 1500's and come away with a good yarn to boot.	2004-11-02

When I initially paged through it, I thought it would be dry, boring and humorless.  Instead, it was utterly fascinating, all 670 pages of my edition.  Not to mention all the wonderful charts and maps.  Down to the very last paragraph.  Perhaps I could have wished for a tad less sailing data, as I am no mariner, and understood very little, but Morison himself actually sailed the four voyages that Columbus took (one in conjunction with Harvard University) and his obvious love of sailing shows on every page. Published in 1942, it won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1943, deservedly so.  And yet - while Columbus was without question one of the world's greatest navigators, all of his exploration was for gold, spices, a way to the Orient of Marco Polo, in other words, wealth, and not for the sheer joy of discovery.  And the Spaniards' treatment of the Edenic Indians, for which Columbus was responsible, and certainly did his own share, was heartwrenching.  Sorry to have finished it.  A most marvelous read.<br /><br />Reread six years later, and almost quit.  Didn't seem as fascinating as the first time around.  And while Morison certainly was enamoured of Columbus, I'm not so sure.  I think he was tunnel-visioned, as perhaps he had to be, and money-grubbing, which might reflect his childhood.  At any rate, it is a puzzle to me why some men remained so loyal and true to him and others, including Ferdinand and Isabella, shunned him.  There must have been something in his makeup which turned men away.<br /><br />The one DVD I watched, made in 1995, almost lifted from the book, which was published in 1942.  So much for any new research.  A second DVD, made in 2007 by The History Channel, was the same.  Claimed to be about Columbus' \\"lost voyage\\", his fourth, but of course every detail was in Morison's book.  And many more the DVD omitted.  Not \\"lost\\" at all.	2004-09-06

Each one satirizes an area of contemporary life (as it was in 1958 when these were published) in the Western world.  An Hungarian violinist, two Russian authors struggling with communism, a Spanish bullfight that gets completely out of hand, and that had me laughing out loud many times, an English colonel growing plants in the title (and best) story, an English scientist who can put a man on the moon, a tragic Czech couple, an English man who is the voice of a rabbit on a BBC children's program, and four World War II generals in a frozen Russian shack.  All are immensely entertaining, unpredictable, very original, and touchingly human.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Ustinov was only 37 when he wrote these.  Imagine. What a talent that man was.  Each of these eight stories is so very detailed, so set in place.  He was a terrific writer.  Each about a particular personality and how the events in the world in which he lives affect him, much like C.P. Snow in his famous series \\"Strangers and Brothers\\".

I own the PBS version with David and Meredith Baxter Birney and have watched it many times, but I still laughed out loud when I finally got around to reading this short little gem. And the illustrations are at least half of the fun. I suspect this can re-read many times, especially when one is in need of a pick-me-up.

Wonderful reproductions in color of their work, and, for the most part, easily understood prose.  I think I learned a lot.  I know I learned that I like Picasso better than Matisse, whom I found to be basically cold and severe, too intellectual in his art.  How he was personally this book does not say.  You do get a little more sense of Picasso than Matisse.  The book focuses on how these two artists played off each other's work almost all their artistic lives.  And as such, it definitely succeeds.  It was actually printed in conjunction with a major exhibition of these two, in Paris, London, and New York.  A must for all art lovers.	2004-07-20

Eliot's description of English pastoral life in 1799 leaves no stone unturned.  The characters are as sharply drawn as if you had met them a few moments ago.  You can literally smell the fresh country air.  Yes, the character of Dinah is overdone, reminding one of Dicken's saccharine women, but a small price to pay in so rewarding a book.  You will be truly sorry when you finish to leave the world Eliot has drawn so well.  The morals of these people are no longer ours, and that must be kept in mind always.  But Eliot has stated that the idea for this book came from a story of her aunt's, who did indeed go to such a woman as Hetty in prison.  And there is a wealth of criticism on \\"Adam Bede\\", including Virginia Woolf's \\"Second Common Reader\\". A rave!<br /><br />In fact, the Masterpiece series \\"Poldark\\" exactly reproduces the local dialect that Eliot so skillfully uses.  Her description of the countryside - in real life Warwickshire - is evocative of a Turner painting.  Arthur was to me the most finely drawn character.  Adam's motivations at times were not clear, and Dinah was just not real.  Nor was Seth.  But Hall Farm, Bartle Massey, Mrs. Poyser, were wonderful characters.<br /><br />On second reading six years later, I loved it all over again.  This time Bartle Massey really stood out as a unique, perfectly captured personality.  And the wisdom of George Eliot.  All her musings and asides are quite wonderful, her obvious love of the English countryside, her insights into human nature.  Hetty, as Eliot wrote her, could be none other than what she was.  It was simply the soul she had drawn at birth.  Adam, although his feelings for her were true and constant, did not actually love her, but only his idealized version of her.  I always picture Adam Baldwin, as he was in \\"My Bodyguard\\", as Adam Bede, and an English actor, Greg something, as Arthur.  The BBC version I watched from 1992 was not bad, but Adam was sadly miscast, as were the Poysers.  That Adam, would have been a perfect Seth.	2004-07-17

At its very heart, it is a love story, yes, despite the incest, taken care of by Van's sterility.  Nabokov's language has always just blown me away.  There are breathtaking passages in \\"Lolita\\", and no less so here.  \\". . . leaving their tiger-marks on the drapery of dreams. . \\", page 253.  It is not, granted, for the faint of heart, but oh so rewarding.  I do agree that the chapter on Time is unpleasant, but don't you think that that is just what Nabokov intended it to be, the passage of seventeen years without Ada?  The book, of course, is about Van, not Ada, and his lifelong (83 years!) obsession with and love of her.  Nabakov very neatly separates sex and love, the two not necessarily being tied together in the way we Americans like to think, at least in our professed vanities. This is a master of prose, at the top of his game.  Worth rereading.  At heart, far more romantic (stripped of all the side bars) than many a modern love story.	2004-06-05

I am updating my review of November 3,2001.  Have continued to work my way thru this cookbook via the index, and let me tell you, you never know what you're going to get.  It has by now become quite obvious that this book suffers horribly from lack of editing.  Many recipes are (or must be) a compilation of two recipes, and they just don't jive.  This can be found mostly in the dessert section.  Some are quite simply, not doable, period.  How can you cut around the hole in a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan angel food cake?  Don't you think they meant to use a 10-inch tube pan?  But there are some recipes that are fantastic, such as a chocolate cake made from a homemade mix, and a flourless chocolate cake to die for. The bouillabaise is wonderful.  Many are, many aren't.   So, cooks, there is real adventure here.  Is it going to be a winner or a dud?  Get stirring and find out.	2004-05-27

I was very sad to finish it.  It is, by far, the best book about art/artists I have ever read.  Manet just comes to life in Cachin's pages, and the color photos are phenomenal.  You can see the brush strokes in some of them.  I find it sad that so much of his work is outside France, as Cachin makes quite clear that his native country neither understood nor appreciated him during his lifetime.  A great painter, I have come to love his work much more after reading this book.  If you love art, don't pass this book by.	2004-04-14

This book is a wonder, a story to treasure.  Beautifully drawn characters of Olivia and Maddie, who are so real.  I never wanted this book to end, yet I devoured it every day.  I loved it!!!  Contrasts the phoneyness of Hollywood with the tough and prosaic Midwest.  Everything is here, from pathos to genuine humor.  Hollywood was screwed to a tee.  The combination of life-threateneing illness with a Hollywood movie is certainly treacherous ground for a debut novel, but it succeeds brilliantly.  Olivia Hunt - someone to remember.  Be sure and read the copyright page, where you will see that Robinson did actually attempt to put together a film of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; with John Cleese and Robin Williams.  Lends a certain authenticity to the novel.	2004-04-08

I'n not sure I can add anything new, except to say I just finished rereading the book after seeing the movie.  And Yes, Nicole Kidman was too perfectly beautiful to be believable in that place and those times.  I had first read &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; when it initially came out, and in reading my review I saw that I had thought the characters rather shallow, and the Frazier was more concerned with the details of everyday life at that time than he was in creating life-like people.  In that opinion, I have changed my mind.  Someone once said &quot;Life is in the details&quot; and Frazier knew it.  However, in another, I have not.  I thought then, and I think now, that the ending was a cheap shot.  As if the author didn't know where to go or what to do.  But it was truly a beautifully written novel, and many passages are memorable.  In the first read, I complained that Inman's story was nothing more than a road trip.  I have since been on such a journey myself, and can now appreciate such a trip more.  It is composed of the people you meet, as was Inman's. Homer was the first to recognize that.	2004-04-08

Very short, only 124 pages, and I think the best word to describe it is - bemusing.  I was charmed by the writer's account of his childhood in the Roaring Twenties.  Written in 1957, so many of his observations on parenting (and he had two of his own) are certainly true today.  We micro-and macro-manage our children.  Are they ever left to their own devices any more?  I do remember one of the things he did, running a needle under the skin of my finger.

At least as much as this rather secretive man allowed anyone to see.  When I finished, I felt like an old friend had left my life.  That said, at times Sandburg sorely needed a better editor.  He would run on forever with newspaper accounts of basically the same thing, as if he had to hammer home the point.  Each and every visitor that ever applied to Lincoln for anything is recorded.  We get the picture 3 pages ago.  The research must have been prodigious.  The 1st volume was rather poetic in the beginning, not surprising from such a one as Sandburg.  Mostly, my interest never flagged.  Six months it took me to read it.  And am very glad I did.	2004-04-07

Hard to put down after you get thru the incredibly difficult 1st few chapters.  Definitely has a very mythic feel to it.  I loved the way he kept backtracking and repeating and filling in.  Very much a Rashomon feel to it.  Different narrators, different tales. But oh what an ending!<br />On the second reading, I loved it even more.  Faulkner's prose -  the words just wash over you, carry you along.  And the story -  a Greek tragedy in every sense.  Probably one of my all-time favorite books.

First story so beautiful and poignant, it brought tears to my eyes.  London displays a true understanding of the deeper reaches of nature.  A remarkably real parable of the civilized dog brought back to his wild roots.  &quot;White Fang&quot;, longer and wildly overwritten, is nevertheless deeply affecting also.  Romantic, sentimental, and perhaps somewhat unrealistic.  Each story was wonderful and very individual, somewhat amazing considering there are 40 of them.  &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; was the best of all, I thought.  The character of Wolf Larsen was just totally intriguing.  And I have never forgotten (and will probably carry with me to my grave) a line from that book, uttered by Larsen.  To paraphase - The most abundant thing on this planet is not air, or water or land.  They are all perishable, or can be ruined or consumed in some way or another. It is life, life itself, that is everywhere.  Wolf Larsen was one of the most unforgettable characters in fiction that I have ever run across.  An amoral man to the nth degree.	2004-04-07

I simply loved it.  A fascination with all things medieval and English surely didn't hurt. There are, in addition to the masterful prose, many thought-provoking sentences which gave me pause.  If I may quote one eye-opening statement found in the introduction:  \\"Christian ethics were more a set of rules demanded by the church, and less an inborn habit of mind.\\"  And another, found on page 14, which, in these times, seems rather eerily pertinent.  Howarth is describing the emergence of the English feudal system.  \\"This evolution has often been called a loss of freedom, and so it was; but absolute freedom had come to be, as perhaps it has always been, a dangerous illusion.  Its loss was really a gain: the acceptance of the duties and mutual support of a social system, the end of anarchy.\\"<br /><br />I have now read this book three times, each time gaining more from it.  Howarth's stance is that William's possession of the Papal Banner and relics and the Pope's denunciation of Harold and England caused Harold to come undone before the Battle of Hastings and not try as hard as he should have to protect the realm.  He likes Harold, however, and sees him as a very empathetic ruler, much as Benton Rain Patterson does in his book \\"Harold and William (see my review).  But so many turns of chance or luck went against him.  I tend now, after many books on the subject, to see William as something of a spoiled brat who simply would not be denied what he wanted.	2001-12-15

Some were just plain awful.  And I'm considered a very good cook, having been doing this for over 30 years.  I love to cook, but this one is not up to snuff. However, those two, apple pandowdy and apple cake, were just wonderful.  So maybe if I go thru more of the recipes it will get better.  One can only hope.  I do appreciate all the exchange and calorie info.	2001-11-03

This is the one.  Basic good advice, no gimmicks or promises of quick weight loss, but I like the tips, and the five steps, and well, just everything about this book.  It lets me know that this will take time, and there is no magic formula (as if I didn't already know that!).  It's just such plain good common sense, in print.  Small changes in your lifestyle are the key, and I know this is right.  Buy it, follow it and all will be well.  And no, I have no connections to the author or publisher.  Just someone who's been trying to do this since forever, at least 30 years.	2001-11-03

But herbs here I had never even heard of, and the pictures are so beguiling.  Those pictures and the huge range of plants are the reason to buy this book.  I intend to work my way thru alphabetically and just grow herbs.  They need no fertilizer, which is purely wonderful.	2001-11-03

It is his despicable behavior, not Bette's, which drives his family down.  And money, money, everywhere.  It's always all about money.  Madame Marneffe seems almost unbelievable, that she could so completely deceive four men all at the same time.  Her end seems contrived, as if she must suffer her just desserts.  All the men, with the exception of Victorin, are just plain stupid; they are used simply for their money.  Only Adeline is a saint, perhaps too much so.  What would have happened if she had acted differently, instead of Balzac's pure model of true Christian love?	2001-11-03

Depressing to read, especially when I thought I had figured out, about 100 pages before the end, what was going to happen.  But the end, when it came, took me completely off guard, made me want to weep.  Which says an awful lot about Arnow&quot;s writing capabilities.  You never saw her writing.  No overblown metaphors or similes.  Just a bleak portrait of one hillbilly woman who could not change or learn from her mistakes.  And pays, oh so dearly.  And yet she paints her characters with such vivid brush strokes that they leap off the page and into my thoughts in bed.  A book not easily forgotten .  Yet not remembered with ease either.  What a tragic figure is Gertie Nevels.	2001-11-03

The pictures are the thing here. If you're looking for in depth information, this isn't the one.  But a nice keeper, especially as the years go by.	2001-11-03

Had never done a bible study before, and this was a good choice, for sure.  Lots of history here and Vos is not an overtly religious writer.  Took me a long time, as I was constantly going back and forth between this book and all the references to the Bible.  Definitely worth the effort. In today's times, with all the troubles in Israel now, the study of its origins was fascinatiing, if not encouraging.	2001-11-03
US	50433431	RTUJ9GWA9I1ND	0440213290	176496173	The Copper Beech	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very Sweet Book	I do rather think that the copper beech tree would have succumbed long ago to all those inroads on its bark. The book is that kind of interweaving story that I like so much.  And Binchy succeeds in it very well.  She makes a small village and its inhabitants come alive.  Sex is there, but it's not detailed or obtrusive.  And she moves among and between, about and around, her characters well.  There is tension built within each chapter - which is about one person - and across the chapters.  Her characters are fairly sharp.  And everybody does not come to a happy ending.  Although I find the marriage of Gloria Darcey a little hard to believe.  For all of that, it is a light, enjoyable novel.  There was, for all its problems, a simpler life in that Irish village.  I sometimes wish for it.	2001-11-03

It is by no means an easy read, and not for you, if you are looking for a plot-driven novel, but if you want to explore those questions we all ask at times, about life, and death, and the meaning of it all, then your search is over.  I am rereading it again, and find that it has lost none of its power as I have aged. Whether the voice of Hadrian or Yourcenar doesn't really matter. A magnificent piece of timeless literature.	2001-01-22
