Joanne Crawford knew she wanted to be a Naval pilot and had plan on not allowing anything or anyone to sop her until a medical condition grounder her.  Finding herself on a land base job she finds herself worrying about Mike.  Mike Shepherd knew from day one of the Naval Academy that he wanted Joanne in his life but he also knew sailing the high seas in a submarine was also a part of his life but when a major mishaps takes place on his ship he finds himself faced with losing his life and the woman he loves.    The book itself had a really good plot but it had moments where it seems the author was trying to draw out the story more than necessary.  I thought Mrs. Wright used her skills of getting you to be able to visualize the characters in the story.  I believe if maybe Mrs. Wright had filled in a few holes that I felt were left open the book might had a better overall feeling to it.  I did enjoy the beginning and the end of the book the most.	2005-06-09

Trent Crosby had lost friends, family, and even his wife but, when he finds out that Rebecca is pregnant with his child he goes out of his way to negotiate a deal that would keep her quiet an his name out of the paper. Rebecca wasn't feeling the deal and made sure Trent knew it. Trent knew the only way to make it right was marry Rebecca.    Rebecca wasn't sure of what to expect, but what she got she wasn't prepared when it all happen, but when situation goes from mellow to worse. Trent comes to Rebecca's side only to have Rebecca deny him. Trent is confuse let along Rebecca is confused and they both are fighting their feelings but not before emotions are expelled.    Christie Ridway did an excellent job bringing the eleventh book of The Logan Legacy allowing those readers that have followed the series continue to follow for those who are just reading her book it stands alone enough to allow her story to stand alone. I rated Right By Her Side at a 3.5 only because Rebecca seemed so unread at certain points and she at other points she seem so unsure of herself but other than those slight character problems. Chrisite Ridgway wrote an interesting yet content story.    ~Reviewed by Milestone Gregory of Platinum Reviewers	2005-04-22
