The first volume contains about 22,000 entries that are single words, word combinations, phrases, and general terminological expressions. The second volume consists of multipurpose Russian and English phrase finders that will help the dictionary users to find needed information easily and readily. <br />All English equivalents are taken from current scientific and technical literature written by native American and British specialists. <br />The dictionary is mainly intended for native Russians, but it will also be useful for those who have a good command of English and superficial knowledge of Russian. <br />The dictionary will be a great support for translators, editors, scientists, engineers, students and all those who are interested in good translation into live current English. <br />Cover, introduction and sample of the dictionary in PDF format<br />Some words about author<BR>A version of dictionary review<BR>This recently released Russian-English Dictionary of Words and Word Combinations in General Use by Scientists and Engineers (hereinafter, RED) is certainly a benchmark publication. The dictionary is intended essentially for Russian-to-English translators. However, thanks to its Volume 2 - Indices, RED becomes equally valuable to those translating from English into Russian. The RED contains approximately 22000 lexical units that include words, word combinations, vocabulary clichés and general-purpose terminological expressions. It follows from the title of the dictionary that the aforesaid words and word combinations are in general use by scientists and engineers working in various areas and specialties. As far as the terms and terminological expressions are concerned, their presence in the RED is minimized and the meaning is not overly technical. <br />Each entry consists of two parts. The upper part is the Russian word or word combination set in a semi-bold type. The lower part is the English equivalent, also set in a semi-bold type. The English equivalent is most often given in a particular context set in a light type. The contextual information performs several useful functions: it provides the native speakers of Russian with a more profound understanding of contemporary English, its syntax, modality, word order, placement of logical emphasis, etc. Besides, the context is a powerful source of associations and often serves as a ready-made formulation of an idea. On the other hand, as far as the native speakers of English are concerned, once they see the context, they are in a position to better grasp the meaning of the Russian phrases being translated. <br />Volume 2 comprises the Russianand English key word indices. Unlike the dictionaries of separate words and terms, any dictionary dealing with word combinations features free word combinations, whose form of expression is often not self-evident, at all. Therefore, there has always been the problem of search in such dictionaries. The purpose of the Russian index is exactly to assist the user in finding, by the key word, the right word combination or one close in meaning. Such index solves the problem of search much more effectively than the offered elsewhere cross-references that call for leafing through a dictionary and remembering all reference variants. The index of English key words is also quite useful: in fact, just like in the case of the Russian index, it contains various models of expressing an idea that a translator may use by association. Frequent resort to the indices develops translator's associative thinking and broadens his stylistic arsenal. <br />With nearly 22000 entries, the dictionary is sure to accommodate all categories of users, from the undergraduate to the accomplished translator. <br />V.Medvedev, professional interpreter of technic and scientifc literature.	2004-04-10

It is also the biggest one covering 500,000 scientific and technological terms both in traditional and the newest fields of science and technology. Lexical databases accumulated by ETS Publishers during the last two decades were used in compilation of the dictionary, which, in turn, took more than five years. This dictionary is the most modern one, too, for since the early 1970s there have been no actually revised technical dictionaries published in Russia.<br />Recent publications in American scientific and technological periodicals, as well as modern American concise scientific and technical dictionaries were also used in the process of compilation of the dictionary, providing for highly competitive edge as concerns the accuracy of definitions.<br />English equivalents are arranged in alphabetic order and may have labels and marks detailing the definition, where necessary. Examples below the heading line provide for further detalization of the definitions or they may sometimes even be inserted in the translation, as a complete phrase.<br />The dictionary was compiled and edited by a team of lexicographers headed by Dmitri A. Rusak. His other published works include English-Russian Dictionary of New Automotive Terms, Dictionary of Abbreviations of the Russian Language, English - Russian - English Dictionary of Business Correspondence (the latter available on CD-ROM only), plus some other works in progress.<br />Owing to the wide lexical coverage the dictionary should beuseful to professional translators, experts in various fields of science and technology, and all those reading Russian scientific and technical publications.	2002-05-29
