US	50902997	R1W05RJL3GBNZ6	0375414576	786383328	My Life	Books	4	4	8	N	N	good but very exhaustive	This is a meticulous telling of Clinton's life through the end of his presidency from his obviously biased perspective (which is of course to be expected from any autobio).  It is clear that the book was a soul-cleansing exercise that Cinton needed to complete in order to set the record straight in his own words.   <br /> <br />Pros: the book is easy, interesting reading.  The story is told in a folksy, conversational style and has a lot of illuminating facts that you will have never known.  It is great to take on a vacation with you to the beach and get totally absorbed. You will have an enhanced understanding of government and of the events that transpired in our recent history, especially of the 1990s. <br /> <br />Cons: The book is so dense that it leads me to think that Clinton wanted to recall and relate every single episode and event of his life, regardless of its big-picture relevance.  He often rattles off political accomplishments of a certain month or week as an unelaborated list of items, and then moves onto the next paragraph.  He does the same with dropping the names of individuals involved, with brief 5-to-10 word descriptions of each, if that much.  It sometimes seems he just wants to fit it all in rather than tell a story.  To me, that speaks of a certain fear of mortality; Clinton wants his story and his life to live on as he wants us to perceive it, and so nothing gets excluded.  Given the book's overall readability and the reader's choice of skimming what they aren't interested in, the book still merits 4 stars.  The book is written in such a way that even if you skip large portions you can still follow.   <br /> <br />Overall:  There is no harm in getting and reading this book, if you like a conversational writing style or have a deep interest in politics (and happen not to be a right-wing Republican).  You will end up a better, more knowledgable person with more sides on all the issues than you did before.  If you still have disagreements with\\"Clinton's version,\\" you'll have better reasons why.  This book is especially valuable to amateur or professional historians now and in the future who wants a single coherent source of Clinton's \\"say\\" on a given matter or something that happened. However, on reading it, you will be able to tell that he bent over backwards to play it safe and seems to tone down honest criticism of particular individuals, except his most partisan enemies.  The worst he will say about anyone one else except for these is something along the lines of \\"I liked such-and-such.  I regret I didn't get to talk to him more about why we differed...\\" or for a frequent exact quote, \\"I regret I lost his friendship.\\" <br /> <br />3 stars for the quality of the historical/ political content.  And an extra one for being a pleasure to read with its conversational style and occasional pearls of wisdom.	2004-12-26

This is unavoidable because of the breadth of what it covers.  The content layout is simple and creative:  Dawkins takes us step by step on a backwards-moving journey from modern homo sapiens back through each of its concestors (most recent common ancestor with another living animal or group of animals).  In other words, from the common ancestor of chimps and humans to the beginning of creation.  Given the subject, this book could have been very, very boring for your average non-paleontologist.  The only reason it isn't is because of Dawkin's plain-speaking, conversational style, and the way his enthusiasm for the subject shines from the page.  And, just to be clear, it is not just \\"not boring\\"; if you read this, expect to be \\"ooh-ed\\" and \\"ahh-ed\\" in various places just as you would from the best of science writing.  That said, this book is a quicker read than its number of pages would imply, since you'll surely skim over the areas that have a little bit too much depth (for those planning on taking it along on their next 2-week holiday).  No matter who you are or how much you love this topic, there are some parts that you will not have the patience to go through word for word.  For instance, I simply could not deal with the pages on how certain worm-like creatures exude waste and from what hole, and I had to give that the quickest of skims. In Dawkin's defense, he wouldn't have been true to the layout of this book to have skipped over any point on our evolutionary line.  (I'm sure there are areas he himself was less than enthusiastic about as he writing about them.) All in all, however, definitely worth a buy..	2004-10-29

After reading this, I feel Alexander Hamilton's premature death ranks as the most tragic in American history while being the least appreciated as such by today's Americans.  Ron Chernow amply shows you why.  In this masterpiece of a biography, Chernow makes you 'know' and identify with Hamilton and the other characters the way a powerful movie drama makes you feel that the fictional characters are actually real.  Of course, the characters in this story ARE real, but it's usually a challenge for non-historians reading about events so different from their own lives to get this feeling.  Most books writing about the distant past are impersonal, and the historical figures within them rarely come across as genuine, real-live people with thoughts, passions, and insecurities just like ours.  Chernow's greatest strength is his ability to draw this out so that you relate to them as if they were living and breathing today. He does an even better job in this book than in 'Titan', his bio of John D. Rockefeller. I think this is partly because Hamilton's own emotional intensity during his life was much greater than, say, Rockefeller's, or the vast majority of people dead or alive.  Whatever it is, the effect is there: I was disappointed in Hamilton for his foibles, was happy when he triumphed, became disgusted by his enemies, and had tears in my eyes when he died.<br />Apart from Chernow's considerable literary prowess, this book makes for a thorough and objective historical record of just how extraordinary this man was from any objective standpoint.  Asked to name the founding fathers before hearing of this book, I would have cited the usual figures: Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, and Madison.  I wouldn't even have thought of Hamilton.  Having read the book, however, it's a defensible argument that while Hamilton (unfortunately) basks in the shadows of the others as far as the popular imagination goes (possible owing only to his relatively short life), he may have been the greatest mind and the most instrumental of all of them.  He certainly was, as Chernow puts it, the &quot;father of the American government&quot; (in the sense of actual administration) even if he was not the father of the system of government or of the American identity, per se.<br />Lastly, apart from telling Hamilton's story, Chernow has written an outstanding book that is a real contribution to the copious general literature on the birth and genesis of America.  I learned more about how our country came to be in this period than from any of my sterile high-school history classes.  The most wonderful thing is that despite my more-than occasional-lack-of-confidence in today's politics and politicians, this book has actually made me proud to be an American again and appreciate this great national experiment that has managed to triumph above all odds because of these men.  I have not read any of the other recent books on the great men of the constitutional era, such as 'Founding Brothers' or 'John Adams' (both of which Chernow quotes from frequently), but I now feel inspired to do so.<br />I know I have to think of SOMETHING negative to say.  Any weaknesses of this bio are pitifully minor compared with its strengths, but if forced to find a few, I would name the following: <br />(1) In my opinion, Chernow over-attributes beliefs and insecurities of the adult Hamilton to childhood influences in various side comments. I happen to think biographers overinterpret the effect of childhood events on adult personality and can be quite gullible in swallowing their own psychobabble.<br />(2) The least interesting part of the book concerned Hamilton's childhood, and especially the confusing and jumpy life of his parents and grandparents.  This could have been shortened somewhat, although if Chernow really wanted to create a full and thorough historical record of the man and his life, he may have felt this necessary, especially because Hamilton's illegitimate birth and unstable childhood form a thematic that is elaborated elsewhere in the book at various points by Chernow.	2004-05-25

If the following describe you (as I hope it does me), then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU:<br />-You crave careful analysis of factual premises and will respect the conclusions therefrom, whether you held such conclusions to start with and even if you're not ultimately convinced.<br />-You respect a writer whose method of argument is rational dissection of the facts, who doesn't rely on the omission or dismissal of relevant information to help make his or her case, and even feels obliged to bring up available information that may even partially undercut his case.<br />-You wish more political commentators would be willing to present opposing viewpoints fairly, explaining these points exactly as their opponents would themselves explain them, without resorting to hyperbole or mischaracterization to help their own case.<br />-You wish more political pundits would take the care to handle their opponent's arguments and statements logically and point-by-point without any purely rhetorical or emotional dismissal of their opponent's position that has nothing do with the underlying logic of that position.<br />If you, like me, believe that this is the way to understand &quot;Truth&quot; and not simply confirm one's own poltical beliefs and biases, then you will find this book IMMENSELY SATISFYING and ALL TOO RARE.  For that alone, I believe this book merits 5 stars, as sadly the above-mentioned criteria are missing from nearly every book written about Bush or his recent predecessors by those on either the left or the right.  <br />I suspect this careful and dispassionate analysis derives from Singer's academic background.  Perhaps we need more real academics to come down from the ivory tower and share their ideas with the rest of us.  This is a true &quot;thinking man's&quot; book.<br />My only caveat, however, that if you have any sort of emotional attachment to Bush the Man rather than mere political support for Bush the President, you will find Singer's cold, calculating analysis of his psyche a little hard to take.  Also, if you are more of a political ideologue than a careful rationalist-pragmatist, you will probably not benefit from this book.	2004-04-13

It's probably the most thought-provoking book I've read since Louis Menand's The Metaphysical Club (If you haven't read it already, look it up), the author of which seems to share the same enlightenment bent as Jacoby.  As you can tell, that philosophy reflects my world view as well.  In fact, the only downside of this book is that you're most likely to enjoy and appreciate it if you, like me, already consider yourself a free-thinking, secular rationalist with an &quot;enlightenment&quot; perspective on history, including a strong belief in the separation of church and state.  If you are a member of the Christian right, you will probably throw this book into the fireplace after the first few chapters (That would be the only alternative to having your views on the mixture of politics and religion painstakingly and devastastingly revealed as narrow-minded and undemocratic).  <br />This is a &quot;history&quot; book, and rarely strays from the rationalist, dispassionate course you'd expect, but Jacoby's personal views are made amply clear: church and state were always meant to be and should remain separate institutions under our system of government.  It's great to have someone like Jacoby on this (my) side, and to put it in print for the record, because she masterfully and precisely conveys the facts of history which, to put it plainly, make her opponents look silly.<br />For a few examples, she:<BR>-catalogs a long litany of misdeeds and injustices that have been carried out in the name of religion, refuting the idea that religion is always a force for good in a political setting.<BR>-successfully undermines, as others have done elsewhere, the idea that the Founding Fathers never intended for the wall between church and state to be applied as strongly as wehave today.<BR>-shows us that current secularist trends where they exist today have NOT arisen only since the 1960s after supposedly being drummed up by hare-brained, dope-smoking hippies who have infected our culture ever since.  Instead, she shows us that there is a long, long secularist, even atheistic, tradition in America and that attempts to paint history otherwise are misguided.  She instead reveals that the resurgence of the Christian right is just as much a product of &quot;today.&quot; (It is only recently that all presidential candidates now publically affirm the strength of their religious faith in order to have any hope of being elected. Most in the past never discussed their faith.)<br />One final plug, the description of the Christian right &quot;utopia&quot; underpinning the culture wars (first two paragraphs of Chapter 7) is among the most eloquent expositions on the thought of mind of those in the Christian right movement I have ever encountered.  If you only browse this book in a book store, I would have you take a look at those lines.  Nothing else so pithily makes you realize the fundamental airiness of the contemporary movement to meld religion and politics.	2004-03-27

I can't think of elsewhere you will get a broader account of the experiences of the main immigrant nationalities of the 20th century.  Unfortunately, the author intersperses his own partisan views throughout the book, which I'm sad to say spoiled the sense I was reading an objective account.  The worst part is that all throughout he tirelessly kept up the pretense of objectivity.  I found it unprofessional and unscholarly, not to mention unfair, for him not only to make no distinction between objective historical analysis and his own political opinions but also to weave them inextricably together so that the reader has to figure out which is which as he is reading.  I found this irritating even though I would happen to agree with some of the author's opinions.  It would at least have sufficed for him to place his political views in separate paragraphs from the historical descriptions -- if he couldn't bring himself to save them for, and only for, the closing chapter, &quot;We've Been Here Before&quot;.  In case you're wondering, the author is a political conservative, which is fine except for the aforementioned problems.  Out of nowhere, he makes side assaults on affirmative action, to which he refers interchangeably with explicit quotas (a distinction liberals would take him up on, but he sees no need to address), and takes his own opinions for granted as he moves on to the next point.  In another case, he brings up, with no relevant point to make about it afterwards, that the Clinton administration rushed through immigrant applications to increase his voter base,  and that many did not get proper criminal background checks (and I'm paraphrasing this gently from the original). This book is overall clearly educational and worthy --the title of the last chapter expresses the main point best -- but unfortunately, the presentation is muddled and doesn't distinguish contemporary partisan politics from history.Because of this, I demoted it from a potential 5 stars to 3.	2001-07-30

This is most engrossing, enlightening historical nonfiction book I've read in years (If you want to know, the most recent comparable work I've read is Titan by Ron Chernow.)  Menand shows that there is nothing new about the moral and legal relativism of contemporary intellectuals.  Those of the 19th Century, too, relentless questioned the supposedly timeless relevance of the absolutes of their day, yielding, in various permutations, the spirit of pragmatism that pervaded the thinking of the Supreme Court of Oliver Wendell Holmes and other institutions of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.  Menand shows how this philosophy promotes not just some crude utilitarian calculus, but ultimately the freedom of expression of all ideas, regardless how objectionable, as the ultimate safeguard of democracy.  This is a timely masterpiece for 21st Century America, which in my opinion is in a new age of uncertainty, where intolerance and absolutism on both left and right, in the form, respectively, of P.C.-liberalism and Judeo-Christian conservatism, has been brought more to the forefront and perhaps represents our greatest national divide.	2001-07-29

This book tells the recent history of why and how men have cared about their looks.  As such, I think it's more informative than insightful.  The most annoying thing about the book is that it is infused with an overly PC writing style:  Quotation marks are overused in an attempt to distinguish traditional meanings from newer, liberal notions.  Words like &quot;male&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot; are put in quotes with regularity, as if to repetitively stress, &quot;if that word means anything, I mean it in the sense of what the unenlightened would say it means.&quot;  The book would have been better served if it actually broached the anthropological as well as historical basis for what these words have meant to people at different times.  This would have provided the tone of objectivity that the book aims for but lacks; its arguments would have been more persuasive.<br />On that note, I should mention that the author tends to overreach, drawing conclusions from isolated quotes and other insufficient evidence.  This left me scratching my head all too often, saying, &quot;Well, not necessarily.&quot;  All in all, if you're interested in a history of the subject of the male beauty obsession, this book is a passable buy; I would skip it if you're looking for a thoughtful historical analysis.	2001-03-05

The only negative thing I can say is that you can tell from the unconventional phrasing that the translation job was almost word-for-word.  There are sentences on every page that were probably graceful in the original French but sounded a little strange in English.  This might annoy you if you're picky about those things, but for me it didn't detract from the story enough to make a difference.

My only warning is that it is much, much less a book on the history of American English than an excuse to write up a laundry list of hilarious anecdotes relating to our cultural heritage.  Very few of them have anything to do with language.  The first chapter or two is a real historical exposition of sorts on American English.  After that, Bryson weaves through several chapters on topics from fast food to air travel, each of whose only credential as a piece of linguistic history is randomly interspersed mention of when words relating to that particular topic were first coined.  Telling us when &quot;hamburger&quot; or &quot;airplane&quot; was coined actually starts seeming tangential to the story and merely obligatory on his part. If you want to purchase an amusing and informal account of our nation's history, then you'll like this book fine. Just don't expect you'll read a real history of our language.	2001-02-22

This book gets 5 stars because it succeeds magnificently in what one ultimately reads any book for -- to delight or entertain oneself.  It manages this despite a weak main argument.  The author hyperbolizes by  imputing the standards and tastes of a small liberal, fashionable, and  self-righteous subset of elites to the group of high-achieving Americans as  a whole.  He did NOT do a good job convincing me that the bobos have really  &quot;taken over&quot; the establishment rather than simply compete for  attention with those of other sensibilities.  What Brooks does provide is  ample evidence that business and the media have in the past decade catered  extensively to the bobos' interests -- but merely, in my opinion, because  they will always chase after where there is money.  He also does a good job  of comically and accurately describing the bobos and their habits using his  acute powers of observation, but this by itself does nothing for his thesis  that the bobos now &quot;rule.&quot;	2000-05-25

Krugman's forte is his ability to bring things down to the basics, combining incredibly sharp thinking with lucid vernacular.  The best part is that it truly makes for very interesting reading.  However, when he  calls attention to the errors of his colleagues or policy-makers, his  language is a little too acerbic for my liking.  I would prefer a more  measured, objective tone.  The fact that this book is basically a  compilation of his newspaper editorials--a reporting medium that tends  toward the nasty, accusatory side--probably accounts for this.<br />As a side  note, one deluctable treat you get from Krugman's analyses is how well he  debunks the notion that fiscal conservatives necessarily have more  clear-headed and economically sound policies from an objective stand-point  than do well-intentioned but supposedly inefficient tax-and-spend  types.<br />All in all, buy it.

I myself can reduce it to one sentence: Financial security,instead of going hand-in-hand with a high income, is built on living realistically within your means by spending less than you earn (accomplished by knowing exactly how much you spend and earn) while actively saving and investing for the long-term.<br />BUT, you have to &quot;live a little.&quot; The millionaire in this book does not live the life you want.  The notion of financial security is most meaningful when you provide a context: the typical millionaire, this book reveals, is financially secure and does not have to worry about money but also is someone with a normal five-figure income who is rich only in assets because all his life he has been a near-pathological miser and ascetic and has almost totally rejected material comforts that aren't strictly practical.  Most of us would happily accept some worrying about finances and retirement in order to enjoy some of the things we just plain want and don't necessarily need.  You only live once.<br />NOTWITHSTANDING, I would recommend taking a peak at this book because the principles it advises, taken in moderation, are desperately needed in today's consumption-obsessed society.  I'm relatively conservative with my finances, and if you are also, you don't really need a book like this moralizing to you about the benefits of being more miserly.  However, too many people, including high-income folks, are way too irresponsible; even if they are not blatantly so (i.e. running up debts they cannot pay), they can use a non-patronizing reality check (before it's too late) about careful spending, saving, and investing.	1999-09-29

Much of this book is commonsense advice on putting things in perspective, appreciating what we take for granted, and just &quot;taking it slow&quot;--ordinary checking points to our everyday trifles that we  somehow always forget to think about.  The Dalai Lama's musings are a nice  reminder.  As far as actually teaching anything, however, this book is a  disappointment.  Only the emotionally immature or naive among us who truly  believe that extra money in the wallet or a new sportscar will actually  result in a permanent rise in their level of content will find this book  genuinely informative.  (But on the other hand, the number of people who  think this way should not be underestimated.)  Nevertheless, as I mentioned  earlier, for the more grounded among us, it is a gentle, worthwhile  reminder of what's important.  But for this purpose, simply browsing  through it in a store or library accomplishes the same as buying it.  Suit  yourself.	1999-09-27

Throw away the financial journals and the stupid investment brochures.  This book proves that 99% of what they sell to you out there is less about  telling you the brutal truth than it is about putting money in THEIR rather  than YOUR pockets.  No other book gives you the cold hard facts.  One of my  favorites: time horizon rather than stock selection is the most important  determinant of risk (the longer, the better) and unless you admit to  yourself that you're speculating (i.e. gambling), the way to own stocks is  to be in it for the long run, period.  But I'm not giving away the ending;  read this book to get the whole picture.  It is is an easy read, filled  with amusing anecdotes and fascinating history that makes the ride all the  better.  Convincing and clever arguments are woven into the tale that will  help you become the most financially sensible investor you can be.	1999-09-22

If it were humanly possible, I would personally place a copy of this book in every bookshelf.  It's a wake-up call to the legal profession, uncovering the dirtiest secrets of the practice.  But more importantly  (though perhaps unwittingly), the authors have provided an advice book for  anyone who may ever have to deal with a lawyer, be it their own or an  adversary (in other words, just about anyone).  It accomplishes this by  informing the reader through example after example, case after case, of the  hidden conflicts of interest that premeate the legal process, some of which  are harmful to society, the client, or both--and most of which would be  extremely difficult to pick up on without legal training.  Before you talk  to your personal lawyer (or an insurance company's, or a class-action  lawyer, etc.), and chances are you will at some point in an unexpected  event, you need to know what may be going on in his or her head.  A central  premise of this book is that the legal code ethics that are overwhelmingly  endorsed by the profession and the Bar itself do not correspond to everyday  ideas about morals or the &quot;right thing.&quot;	1999-09-21

Good, light-hearted read.  It's difficult for me to laugh out loud from something I read, but I did with this one.  Funnier in the beginning than in the end, partly because you start to get used to his writing style and  his sometimes outrageous asides lose their element of surprise.  Still,  it's well worth the money if you're in the mood for funny anecdotes and the  occasional comic insight.  I recommend it strongly for those who have never  read him.  Those who are familiar with Bryson (as I was not, but as many of  the other customer commentators apparently were) might as well skip it;  it's nothing exceptional.	1999-09-20

However, although it promotes &quot;chic simple&quot; classic designs as your everyday time-tested fashion solutions, many of the outfits pictured in the  book lean on the trendy.  Ironically, this book will be dated within five  years.	1999-09-20

Skip it--that is, if you're actually looking for a book to give you some advice on style.  I would recommend &quot;Attention to Detail&quot; or &quot;Men's Wardrobe&quot; instead.  What it is, in fact, is a glorified  picture book, with historical annotations and some celebrity cameos.  The  fashion advice is not that helpful and (at least in my opinion) not always  accurate.  It's great on a coffee table or in some kind of lounge setting,  where the occasional mindless picture book strewn around somewhere helps as  a conversation piece.	1999-09-20

Keep it close to  your coffee table (it's a conversation piece) and thank your lucky stars  you were born in the 20th century and not the 10th!	1999-09-17

This is a pleasant read, particularly for tbe regular New Yorker reader.  It provides a good insight into the opinions and pretenses of educated, liberal-minded, and financially comfortable Americans of the '40s and '50s  with regard to issues we learned about mostly through dull high school  history lectures.  Each chapter focuses on a particular theme of the era,  such as McCarthyism, civil rights, household help, etc.  All are  well-written, but I think in some sections, the author draws a few too many  psycho-babblish inferences.	1999-09-09

The best book on race and race-consciousness I've ever read.  It's pleasant to read and very relevant to contemporary, post civil-rights racial understanding in America.  Most importantly, it does not degenerate,  as other books on race do, into the victim-versus-oppressor stance.  It's a  book on basic human relations and identity development as it relates to  race that is well reasoned and convincing.  In particular, White Americans  who are troubled by issues of race but are terribly confused would gain  tremendous value from reading this book.	1999-09-09
