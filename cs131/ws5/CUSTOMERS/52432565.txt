Like a fool, I decided to write a master's thesis on Charles  Bukowski.  The department chair stuck me with a professor who was  supposedly the resident expert on contemporary American literature.  From  our first conversation it was clear that the man not only had no respect  for Buk, but hated his work and hated the very notion that anyone would  want to do graduate level work on him.  He dismissed the idea with a sniff,  saying, &quot;He's marginal and unworthy.  No one has written a book on  him.&quot;  I am sad to report that I let the bastard get the better of me.   The thesis went unwritten.<br />Well, that was a decade ago and since then  there have been several very fine books written about Bukowski.  Three  excellent volumes come readily to mind: Neeli Cherkovski's seminal  biography, &quot;Bukowski: A Life&quot;; Gay Brewer's Twayne volume,  &quot;Charles Bukowski&quot;; and Russell Harrison's &quot;Against the  American Grain.&quot;  All are top notch in their own way.<br />Now we have  Howard Sounes' worthy addition to this list, &quot;Charles Bukowski: Locked  in the Arms of a Crazy Life.&quot;  This new biography works well as a  compliment to Cherkovski's more intimate work (Neeli and Hank were good  friends and the closeness of their relationship informs every page of the  text).  Sounes' book is more flamboyant, to be sure, and paints Bukowski in  darker colors than does Cherkovski's.  Both portraits are quite valuable  and, even more important, both are very good reads.<br />I'm still waiting,  though, for the definitive Bukowski biography to emerge, a book that  combines a true scholar's rigor with a novelist's eye for detail. Maybe  some new English professor or graduate student coming up will grab for the  brass ring.  I can't help but think that our universities will finally  forget their snobbery and small brained prejudices and hop on the Bukowski  bandwagon.<br />What I would love to see published is a book that encompasses  the pictures painted by Sounes, Cherkovski, Brewer and Harrison, with added  chunks of personal grace and style thrown in by this to-be-named  biographer.  It's bound to happen some day because Bukowski's legacy is  simply too daunting, too great to be ignored.<br />In the meantime, I  recommend this book and all of the others I named above. There are other  fine volumes on Buk out there, too.  Go find them all and read them right  away.  You'll learn lots of cool stuff and be the life of your next  cocktail party!	1999-05-08

As a longtime Bukowski reader, though, I must say that I found this to be a well-crafted and informative read.<br />While it is true  that a good bit of the material here will be very familiar to anyone who  has read a fair amount of Bukowski's work, Cherkovski does a good job of  infusing this material with interpretation and previously unreported  anecdotes.<br />I'm looking forward to reading Howard Soune's Buk bio -- I  hear it's great; but folks, this book is very fine, too.<br />As Bukowski  scholarship grows and more biographies are written, as they are sure to be,  I predict that this one will continue to more than hold its own.	1999-04-27

The best thing about it for me, however, was an introduction into the works of  B. Traven, a writer I had never heard of before this book.  Traven, the  author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and many other novels, is a  forgotten treasure in our literature.<br />I highly recommend this slender  volume to anyone interested in discussions of contemporary American  literature.  Be warned, though:  This is not dry, academic discourse.   William Joyce, for all of his erudition, is a bloody, passionate thinker  and a living man.  In other words, he's the perfect sort of fellow to write  criticism of Bukowski, Miller and B. Traven.	1999-04-20

If you've found your way to this page you clearly either have an interest in Charles Bukowski or in tournefortia, which, I understand, is some sort of hanging plant -- tournefortia, I mean, is some sort of hanging plant,  not Bukowski, who is a man. (Can't use &quot;was&quot; here, by God,  because Hank will be with us always.)  Ahem.  Bukowski, of course, is a  poet, for some of us, make that for many of us, THE poet, the best damned  poet of the 20th century, maybe of the ages.<br />But, having found your way  here, you know all that.  I'm preaching to the choir.  (Unless you are that  rare tournefortia afficianado who cares only for plants and nothing for the  sublime lines of the master.  In that case, you must quit this place for a  more horticulturaly friendly environment at once.  At once, do you  hear?)<br />There are many fine poems in this book:  &quot;The Lisp,&quot;  &quot;The Man at the Piano,&quot; &quot;One for Sherwood Anderson,&quot;  the list goes on and on.  It's an outstanding collection, one any Bukophile  should own.  Hell, buy two and give one to a friend.  That, at least will  keep them from stealing your copy for a while, at least until someone  steals their own and they need another -- damn it! -- right this minute and  they know where you keep yours.  Come to think of it, maybe you should buy  three or four of every Bukowksi title.  God knows I've lost dozens of  copies of his books through the years.  I take solace in the understanding  that they are still out there, still being loaned and stolen and loaned  again, making the rounds from needy hand to needy hand and will be doing so  from now till they fall to pieces or the end of things descends upon us  all.	1999-04-14

Maybe I messed up a  little here and there and this damned thing won't let me put in the line  breaks.  Still, it's a glimpse into the man's poetry.  Bukowski is a God,  folks, the best American writer of the 20th century.  Don't let any pissant  English teacher (or English major, for that matter, and I've been both) try  to tell you different.<br />Read Bukowski and LIVE!!!!!!	1999-02-27

This collection is intense, hillarious, joyful, heartbreaking and sometimes very, very  weird.   It is magnificent. Don't  stop with this one, though. Read RAY.  Read GERONIMO REX.  Read BATS OUT OF  HELL.  Hell, read everything you can get your grubby little hands on.    I've never gone away from a Barry Hanna book disappointed or unchanged.	1999-02-04

That it is out of print demonstrates two awful truths:  1)The American reading public doesn't know squat; and 2)Our great  publishing houses are staffed with idiots.<br />Seriously, if you can get your  hands on this book, do it.  I'll bet your local public library has a copy!   The story is textured, twisted, uplifting hillarious and horrifying all at  once.<br />We got complex race relations, we got sexual tension and real sex  and sorrow, we got bravery and cowardice and we got the goods right here,  bro, I guarantee!!<br />Good grief, read this book!!!!	1999-01-29

In general I find his work to be fascinating, thought provoking and potentially of enormous import.<br />This time, though, I think he drops the ball.  Unlike  his previous work -- especially the magnificent FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS --  this book reads as though it were thrown together in a couple of weeks to  make a few bucks.<br />Forget this one and read FINGERPRINTS.	1999-01-25

It's a quick read and well worth the few hours you will devote to its pages.<br />While it isn't as full a novel as To Kill a Mockingbird, readers  who loved Scout, the young heroine of that book, will very likely find a  place in their heart for Frankie.<br />I recommend this very highly.	1999-01-21

It is my understanding that Fante dictated it to his wife near the end of his life, after he had lost his sight to diabetes.   Regardless, I loved it.  This was the first Fante I read and it made me  want to read everything I could get my hands on.<br />I'm not suggesting it's  his best -- I think &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; holds that honor -- but for my  money &quot;Dreams from Bunker Hill&quot; is a damned fine book.	1999-01-20

US	52432565	R3JL6Y6W736BNN	0897080998	685877080	Karate, techniques of self defense as taught by Master Sin The, 10th Dan of Shaolin karate, and Master Hiang The, 8th Dan of Shaolin karate	Books	1	3	3	N	N	This is one of the strangest books I've ever seen	Either their copy of this bizarre little book is different than mine or the Reader from Planet Reality Check got a little sloppy in his or her review.  The term Sin The uses is &quot;I-pong.&quot; Of course, that's as  strange and off base as &quot;epong,&quot; but we might as well get it  right if we're accusing the author of being wrong.  <br />This book is a  companion piece to a series that was shown on Kentucky Educational  Television back in the 80's.  I used to watch it as a kid.  Sin The and his  brother Haing The (I had a buddy who liked to call the brother Hang Ten)and  their students demonstrated Shaolin Do and Sin The talked about the  style.<br />Regardless of what you think of the information provided in this  book, I suspect most buyers would feel cheated if they got it sight unseen.   I guess it's supposed to work like a manual for those people trying to  learn Shaolin Do from the KET program, because the material covered in the  show is the same stuff in the book.  Without the tape, though, it would be  difficult to get much out of this book.<br />The physical presentation of the  book is also quite poor.  It's spiral bound with disjointed, cheesy text   -- at one point the phrase, &quot;may the force be with you&quot;  rears  its ugly head -- and has no photographs.  Instead there are amaturish line  drawings illustrating the techniques.<br />It is fascinating to watch the  ongoing debate in the &quot;Shaolin Do: Secrets from the Temple&quot;  reviews about whether Sin The is all that he says he is.  I'm not here to  say whether Sin The is a legitimate Grandmaster of the Shaolin martial  arts.  Whether he is or is not, however, the two books being sold by Amazon  do very little to give him the appearance of being the real thing.   &quot;Karate&quot; lacks substance and dignity, while &quot;Shaolin Do:  Secrets from the Temple&quot; is filled with a number of grand claims with  very little supporting evidence.  Certainly no one outside the Shaolin Do  circle seems willing to back them up.  A useful comparision might be made  with Shaolin kung fu master Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming or with the late  Kyukoshinkai master Mas Oyama, or the late Kempo master Ed Parker, or any  number of other outstanding martial artists who have achieved a national  reputation.  You just don't hear people questioning their authenticity  because their rank is documented and their abilities have been observed by  more than just their own students.<br />Maybe Sin The will write another book  and clear all of this up once and for all.  Maybe he'll produce and sell  videos so people will actually be able to see what he can or cannot do and  judge for themselves.  Until then, I have to say that it is highly unlikely  that anyone interested in the martial arts and who is not already a Shaolin  Do student would find much to cheer about in the currently available  volumes.	1998-11-21
