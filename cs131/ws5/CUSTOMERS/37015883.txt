Read this book and develop a better understanding of why. <br /> <br />Ries and Trout are two of the top, if not the top, marketing strategists in America and have been recognized as such since they first published their seminal work, \\"Positioning.\\" In \\"Horse Sense,\\" they turn their attention away from the world of corporate markeitng and advertising and focus on how people really get ahead in life. Hint: working your tail off ain't gonna get you there.  <br /> <br />Essentially, you have to get a horse to ride. That horse could be another individual, an idea, a relative, any number of things. The central idea is that hard work is not what leads to success, rather in most cases it is what so many of us suspect: its not what you know but who you know.  <br /> <br />THe authors offer example after example, sometimes to the point of redundacy, to demonstrate that few people are successful simply because they put their nose to the grindstone. In a world where everyone works harder and later, hard work will not get you noticed.  <br /> <br />While the authors sometimes stretch their Horse analogy a bit too far, this book is a definite eye-opener and may well change you attitude on how to truly get ahead. I think you'll agree with them on most of their observations and suggestions. Read it and find out for yourself.	2004-08-24

Ries and Trout provide commentary in the margins, rather than rewriting passages in the book. <br />And in those margins, they can sometimes be brutally honest, as they occasionally admit to being wrong on some of their theories. But what you will note as you read this book is that the theories they advanced 20 years ago have largely proved out in the interim. This is a seminal work, a book that should be read by anyone involved in any form of marketing. <br />The current hot trend in marketing-- &quot;branding&quot;-- is in many ways an outgrowth of the theories put forth on &quot;Positioning.&quot; Essentially you distinguish your product or service from the competition. The ideal means of doing this is to be first to the market with your product or service, although that is no guarantee of continuous success. This may also mean finding an untapped niche, particularly in crowded categories. <br />Particularly interesting I their discussion of line extension, and how it dilutes, rather than strengthens, a company's position in the marketplace. And it is interesting to read how some companies at one time literally owned a particular product category, only to lose it when they tinkered with their concept too much. <br />Education, entertaining, and enlightening, this book is an important addition to anyone interested in marketing library.	2004-06-27

There is a new edition currently available which can be found elsewhere on Amazon, although it is, in my opinion, grossly overpriced. And, as I will explain, there are other ways to get a copy of it besides spending nearly 100 of your hard earned dollars. I hate to pass on buying a book, but the publisher is just nuts selling it for nearly $100.00.<br />Eugene Schwartz is one of copywriting and advertising's legends. His story is well known among copywriters: He started in mail order as a delivery boy in 1949 and became a junior copywriter before the end of that year. By 1951, he was a copy chief and became the president of his own mail order firm in 1954. He skills as a copywriter led him to become one of advertising's highest paid consultants (Rodale Press once paid him a commission of $54,000 for four hours work). <br />This book is considered by many to be a classic on copywriting in general and mail order copywriting in particular. It is also legendarily reputed to be the &quot;most stolen&quot; book from public libraries and it is claimed that there are only 130 copies to be found in the world. I'm not sure about that claim as my local library came up with a 1966 copy with no problem and the librarian indicated that other copies were available from other libraries. She also had never heard of it as being the &quot;most stolen&quot; book in public libraries.<br />This is the most recently published edition and it appears to have been published, in part, because of the reputed difficult of finding copies. The price of $95.00 would seem to reflect a pent-up demand for it (more on that later).<br />&quot;Breakthrough Advertising&quot; is excellent in its analysis of advertising and the marketplace. Schwartz was an advocate of the idea that advertising could not create demand but it could channel it to a certain product. He referred to demand as &quot;Mass Desire&quot; and believed that there had to be some level of desire before a product could be offered and sold profitably. An example he uses is that of weight loss. There is a huge mass desire to lose weight and, as a consequence, a demand for weight loss products. The job of the copywriter, according to Schwartz, is to tap into that demand and channel it to the particular product the copywriter is selling.<br />Schwartz continues throughout the book to analyze the make-up of a good advertisement, focusing heavily on the headline as being the make-or-break item of any good advertisement. He then continues in a discussion and analysis of the body of an advertisement as well as giving his opinion on some aspects of layout. He admittedly doesn't spend much time on the subject of layout, but his discussion of layout is quite revelatory.<br />Schwartz's work isn't necessarily a great revelation today. Most other books I have read on the subject of advertising and copywriting recognize many of the same principles he discusses. In fact, you can read on everything he touches upon in other more modern, and cheaper, sources. That being said, the book is still a worthwhile read. Schwartz has an engaging writing style and he does a great job of breaking his chapters down into subtopics and subheadings (a direct mail technique he obviously is employing in his book). Anyone with an interest in copywriting and advertising should take the time to read and learn from Schwartz. You will no doubt learn something about the craft of copywriting that you previously were unaware of.<br />Now as to the price of the current edition, if you are like I normally am and just have to have a book on your shelf, you might want to go ahead and buy it. I personally found the price prohibitive and did not purchase it. Instead, I checked the library's copy out and took a lot of notes. I would love to add this book to my library, but not at a cost of $95.00. I really think someone is gouging those with any interest in Schwartz's work at that price, but I guess thereare more than enough individuals willing to that price for them to offer it at $95.00.<br />The price seems even more prohibitive given the fact that most of the information is available from other sources and the fact that the writing is somewhat dated.	2004-04-09

The book is clearly a precursor to &quot;Ogilvy on Advertising,&quot; as many of the same elements can be found in it.<br />Ogilvy has a wonderfully casual, yet occassionally pompous, style to his writing, but he clearly knows and understands advertising. He manages that rare combination of managing to teach while entertaining. Sometimes his ego and pride come across too strongly, but given the man's accomplishments, I'll cut him slack. And you may wonder why he starts off discussing his days as a chef in Paris, but he does a great job of analogizing that experience to his experiences with running an ad agency.<br />Highly recommended for anyone involved in advertising, particularly copywriters. Ogilvy was a copywriter and he clearly has a special admiration for those who write copy for a living. He also has great advice to share for anyone in advertising.	2004-03-25

Unlike the more common direct mail letter wherein you are selling a product or service, fundraising often offers nothing more to the receipient than a chance to feel good about doing good.<br />As a consequence, fundraising letters for charities and oher non-profits literally have their own rules that vary from the traditional approach to direct mail. Warwick is the recognized master of this field and is a legend in fundraising circles. <br />Every charitiable organization and non-profit group should have this book on their shelf, or have a copywriter available to them that does. And even if you aren't going to apply the principles in the book to fundraising, its still a great guide to writing effective marketing copy.	2004-03-24

So many of us struggle with issues of why we are here and what is our purpose in life. And when my church recently began a 40 days of purpose campaign (which involves reading a chapter a day and meeting once a week with a small group to view a video of Warren and discuss that week's reading), I was pumped to get started.<br />Unfortunately, if you've read much previously on the subject of &quot;why we are here&quot; there's not a whole lot of new ground covered. The book simply has not been the revelation for me that, for example, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; was. It is well organized and well written, and clearly designed to appeal to today's average reader who doesn't want to devote more than 5-10 minutes reading anything. <br />I can see where it would be a wonderful starting point for someone new to Christianity or a Christian who has not previously explored any of the wealth of similarly-themed literature, but with few exceptions, I haven't really come across anything new. And this opinion is echoed by others I've spoken with. <br />That being said, the book is well organized and Rick Warren has a lively, inviting writing style. The book won't bore you and even if you have read similar books extensively there is still some good advice in the book.<br />I give Rick Warren credit for writing an entertaining  and informative book. No doubt it will have a profound effect on a large number of people. I just wish it had covered more new ground along the way.	2004-03-22

I have no idea if this review will actually make it online. Several months ago the author got into an ongoing battle with reviewers and apparently managed to have several reviews, including mine, deleted. I don't know if perhaps I am permanently banend from reviewing it.<br />This is a book only in the sense that it is a collection of words bound together. The opening chapter is full nonsensical discussions going on between the crew of a space shuttle that is apparently bound for the moon, or should I say &quot;planet moon,&quot; as the author calls it. The crew consists of two men and a woman who it appears are engaging in light banter between themselves although I have no idea (nor will you) what they are talking about.<br />And it only gets worse. It's almost like this book was written in a foreign language and than badly translated into English. <br />Equally troubling is the author's claim to be being a best-selling writer, with absolutely no evidence of it. He's not the only author to do this, but his brashness in making the claim is unusual. And if his other book is anything like this one, I doubt anyone beyond he and a few friends an relatives ever paid for it.<br />This is a terrible book, essentially unreadable. It's worth looking at only for the bizarre writing it contains and for a reasonably interesting cover.	2004-03-16

Slaunwhite discusses everything from the equipment one needs (although the prices he lists are probably actually higher than what one will end up paying today) to finding clients and marketing your services.<br />Slaunwhite ably anticipates and covers many of the questions one who is considering the business might have. He includes a section with interviews of three other copywriters, notably Bob Bly (the inspiration for so-many other freelance copywriters), discussing the business and how they started and succeeded. He also goes one step further than many of the other books on this subject but providing a detailed discussion of the craft of copywriting, a subject frequently glossed over in other books.<br />My only real complaint with the book? The CD-Rom that is included is not what one would expect with the book. I had thought it would be packed with forms that were directly tied to the book. Instead it is a collection of helpful, but generic, general business forms.  I suspect that this is something the publisher attaches to all their \\"start and run\\" series of books. I just wish they had been clearer about what the CD-Rom actually was.<br />I also wish Slaunwhite had collected all of his forms that he does reference in an appendix. Instead, they are scattered throughout the book in the chapters to which they are pertinent. But this is a relatively minor complaint.<br />All-in-all, Slaunwhite does an excellent job of explaining how to start and run a freelance copywriting business. His book ranks right up there with Bowerman's. I would recommend both to aspirants and pros alike.	2004-03-16

Books	5	10	12	N	N	A Great Tribute and Collection	Over the years, Robert E. Howard's (REH) Conan stories have been muddied by an uncountable number of pastiches as well as occasional over-aggressive editing (let's just say REH was sometimes not too politically correct). And it has always been difficult to find his works collected in one place, or, at least gathered into several volumes. Hopefully, this is the start of a collection of the complete works of REH on Conan.<br />What we are given here is largely pure REH, untouched by modern hands and in all his bloody glory. The volume collects about one-third of Howard's Conan output and has the bonus of collecting synopses of several of the stories, drafts, fragments, Howard's notes on the Hyborian Age and its people, maps, and even a Howard poem (\\"Cimmeria\\").<br />Part of what is amazing about REH is the sheer volume of output he produced in a relatively short span of approximately 12 years. When you consider that in addition to his Conan work he was also cranking out westerns, boxing stories, horror stories, and nearly every type of adventure story imaginable, and doing it all on a typewriter where starting a second draft meant starting over at the beginning, it is phenomenal. Imagine what his output would be had he had access to a word processing program.<br />A minor criticism: some of the illustrations. I generally love Mark Schultz's work, but his Conan is sometimes a little too modern in appearance or maybe even a little too \\"Prince Valiant\\" like. A prime example is the frontispiece. This image just doesn't evoke Conan for me. But the majority of the art in the book is great. A better depiction is found on page 297, now that's the Conan I know and love. Guess Mr. Schultz (who I do admire greatly) and I will have to disagree over some of his interpretations of Conan.<br />Not all Conan stories are necessarily great. Producing at the pace he did meant that the occasional mediocre story found its way into print. I've always thought \\"The Vale of Lost Women\\" was one of his lesser efforts, and it appears Mr. Schultz, who also wrote the Forward for the book, agrees with me. But this volume also contains some of the best of Conan: \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" \\"The Scarlet Citadel,\\" and \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" among them. <br />One thing that may be slightly confusing to new Conan readers, REH did not write his Conan tales in any semblance of chronological order and these stories are printed in the order of original publication. So in some stories, Conan is already a king while in others he is still pretty much a vagabond adventuring across the world. Previous efforts at collecting REH's works often insisted on placing them in chronological order. If you are new to Conan, just go with the flow. Understand that REH had no grand plan for Conan, in fact, he often claimed the stories literally seemed to just spring up, as if Conan were telling stories of his life directly to him. <br />My only other minor criticism: I would have preferred that there be a hardback edition. I've always preferred hardcover to paperback. Still, this oversized paperback is definitely a quality effort. someone is attempting to do it up right. Hopefully, this volume will do well enough that they will be able to complete the reprinting of the remaining Conan tales. <br />If you are a longtime REH or Conan fan, you have to have this book in your library. If you are new to REH and Conan, strap in, you are in for a wild ride. The world of Conan is a fascinating, thrilling one.

US	37015883	R1JBQZ45COW8HW	0439403960	587017410	Clifford The Big Red Dog	Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Big Red Favorite of My Kids	Clifford is one of those literary creatures who adults find hard to quite \\"get.\\" I am among those adults, but I have to admit, my children love all things Clifford and when his show is playing on the local PBS channel, its \\"must-see-TV\\" time for thekids.<br />This is the book that launched Clifford's career. Originally released in the late eighties, Clifford has grown into a children's icon. Norman Bridwell apparently hit upon a idea that resonates with children. Of course, most kids love dogs, red is a color that stand out, and I guess combine the two in a giant dog and you've got instant appeal to the toddler set.<br />I don't mean for that to sound cynical. Clifford's stories frequently contain good moral lessons for the children and most often revolve around the concept of \\"love\\" for one's pet and vice versa.<br />Oddly, in this, the first book in the series, there is no explanation for why Clifford is a giant dog (I've never sorted out how tall he actually is; sometimes he appears to be 10-12 feet tall and sometimes twice that height). Of course, my four-year-old could care less about explanations, she just loves him.	2004-02-12

What exactly makes this book so frightening? The fact that many of their conclusions are probably correct.<br />A friend who happens to be a CPA who counsels families in financial trouble told me about this book. She actually is warning her clients not to read it because it paints a fairly bleak and depressing picture. Naturally, after she told me this, I had to read it, even though she was correct, much of the information contained in it is depressing.<br />For one thing, in many ways the integration of women into the workplace and the rise of the two income family has not had the positive effect one might have hoped it would. Because so many families are now two income dependent they have become trapped and are more financially vulnerable than previous generations. Many families use all of the income they receive from both husband and wife, and barely get by. As a result, any interruption of the income flow can result in disaster. One telling statistic: today's two-income family earns 75% more money than its single-income counterpart of a generation ago, but actually has less discretionary income once their fixed monthly bills are paid. <br />This is generally blamed on overconsumption and claims that we are a credit card generation that it is paying the price for its free spending ways. And no doubt credit spending has its role in the financial problems of middle America. But Warren and Tyagi make a compelling case that this is not necessarily the whole story. Instead, they propose that the culprit is in large part the ever escalating cost of housing and education in America's suburbs.  As many parents chase the better schools in an attempt to assure their children the best possible education, real estate prices in areas serviced by those schools rise and with it the cost of the homes.<br />At one time, families could count on stay-at-home mothers as a kind of financial safety net if disaster struck. If dad lost his job or some other financial problem arose, mom could go to work either fulltime or part-time to help tide the family over until the crisis abated.  But today, when so many families are dependent on two incomes, families are at a frightening risk should any financial crisis arise in the family.  The authors do propose some modest solutions, but its doubtful many of their suggestions would ever be implemented on anything more than a limited basis.  Among their suggestions are rate caps on credit cards and open-access public schools, but none of their suggestions can truly provide a fix for the problem.<br />Some people have dismissed their findings and conclusions. Unfortunately, I believe they are truly on to the core of the problem. <br />While this book does indeed paint a bleak picture, with bankruptcy often proving to be the only solution for many families, it is a timely and recommended book for anyone concerned about the financial future of Middle America. I would criticize the authors for not offering more realistic solutions to the problem, unfortunately in the current economic environment there may not be any.	2004-02-12

It is a retelling of the story of Noah from the Book of Genesis, told in such a way as to appeal to children. <br />Having said that, this might well be Ms. Cousins' best work. Her art style is simple but colorful, and if you doubt she truly has an art style consider this: her art is always instantly recognizable. Both myself and my children can spot a Cousins' book from a mile away. <br />To her credit, Cousins doesn't dwell on some of the more somber aspects of the story, i.e., that all but a few members of mankind are to wiped out by the flood. Rather she focuses on the positive aspects of the story-that God choose to allow some small remnant of mankind and the animal kingdom to continue, with a renewed hope that perhaps man would get it right the second time around.<br />The art is colorful and my children spend quite a bit of time trying to identify the various animals. We've identified all of them except for a few insects, so if you happen to figure out all of the bugs, let us know.<br />This book is a great introduction to the Bible for small children. If only everyone trying to introduce children to the Bible could do so as wonderfully as Ms. Cousins.	2004-02-11

Howard (REH), this is not for you. But if you are a student of his work, if you are truly interested in what others have to say about his writings, this is a must have.<br />Howard is lucky enough that occasionally his admirers turn a critical eye toward his work, and often such serious reviews and studies of his work leave you wondering, \\"what if he had not killed himself?\\" This is just such a work, one that leads you to see REH as far more than just the man who created Conan. <br />This book is the work of a number of writers, who all have one thing in common: a very serious interest in Howard's work.  It is  the definitive critical anthology on the writings of REH. The essays, by such individuals as fantasy writer Fritz Leiber, the poets Donald Sidney-Fryer and Steve Eng, the Howard bibliographer Glenn Lord,  Dennis Rickard, George Knight, and Ben Indick, critically survey REH's fantasy, westerns, poetry, and supernatural horror tales.  The book includes an annotated bibliography of Howard's books as well as an appendix listing all the volumes known to have been in Howard's personal library.	2004-02-09

I have to admit, I am often a sucker for financial advice books of the \\"learn to manage your money\\" ilk, rather than \\"hey, here's how to get rich and never worry about money again\\" variety. A few weeks ago I heard Michelle Singletary (who is also a newspaper columnist at the \\"Washington Post,\\" where she writes a column-\\"The Color of Money\\") in an interview on the Diane Rehm show on NPR a couple of weeks ago, and I quickly picked up her book. She is brash and funny and she definitely is no holds barred in \\"7 Money Mantras for a Richer Life,\\" and that's a good thing.<br />So what are the seven mantras? They are: (1) If it's on your ass, it's not an asset!; (2) Is this a need or is it a want?; (3) Sweat the small stuff; (4) Cash is better than credit; (5) Keep it simple; (6) Priorities lead to prosperity; and (7)  Enough is enough.  some of those are self-explanatory and some aren't, but the general gist of the advice is: pay attention to where your money is going and don't get wrapped up in material possessions.<br />Now this isn't necessarily new advice, but Singletary's presentation goes a long way toward making all the advice memorable and useable.  Much of the advice was handed down from her grandmother, Big Mama, who is referred to throughout the book. Big Mama brought up Singletary and her four siblings in Baltimore on a salary that never reached more than $13,000 a year. Singletary notes that \\"Big Mama knew the difference between buying things that improve your net worth and stuff that just makes you look wealthy.\\" Clearly, in the area of finances Big Mama was far wiser than myself and many others.<br />Singletary offers some of her wisdom and experiences along the way. For example, say no to lunches out during the workday. But if you do, skip appetizers and desserts. You'll cut costs and calories. And try going a month or two without a credit card. Contrary to popular belief, when it comes to money, it's the small stuff that counts. Sweat it. She notes that Big Mama would say, \\"You can't have a dollar without a penny.\\" Just think about it and it will make sense to you.<br />Singletary also boasts that she breast-fed all three of my children because the milk was free. In fact, she breast-fed her first two children until they were two years old. Singletary literally is giddy about all the money she saved on infant formula.<br />In addition to her advice and that of Big Mama, she also offers 10 pages of penny-pinching tips sent to her by readers. I'm not sure I want to try some of them, but I guess if you truly watch your money it all adds up. An example from her readers: Don't order lemonade at a restaurant. Ask for a lemon, squeeze it into your water glass and add some sugar.<br />She also provides concise definitions of the language of credit from cash advance to grace period to various interest rates charged. She doesn't sugar coat anything either. Getting out of debt is rarely easy, so she warns \\"beware of those who would 'fix' your debt.\\"<br />And Singletary offers some advice my wife may have wished she had been aware of. Before you marry, exchange credit reports. Singletary thinks this is a great idea. As she says, \\"What better way to get to know your honey than to see how he's handled his money?\\" Thing is, she is probably right. She goes on to discuss other ins-and-outs of managing money in a marriage, often using her experiences in her marriage as examples. For instance, she and her husband have an agreement not to spend more than $200 without discussing it with each other first.<br />Her take on making funeral arrangements is brutally honest but humorous. When her grandfather died, the funeral director tried to get Big Mama to buy the casket that her husband deserved. Big Mama's response: \\"He won't know if I'm burying him in a pine box or a bed sheet. It doesn't make good sense to bury good money in the ground.\\"<br />This is a great book for those trying to cut expenses and save. The advice is sound and of use toeveryone.e to everyone.	2004-02-02
US	37015883	RC7U97E68T764	0743255453	937109510	The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	29	32	N	N	Genuinely Raises the Question: "Who's In Charge Here?"	Paul O'Neill thought he was getting Robert Rubin's old job when he was appointed Treasury Secretary, but in fact he was only assuming the title. Mr. Rubin's job, at least as described by Mr.Rubin, was to sift though economic data, study the intricacies of world economics, and to shape domestic and global economic policy accordingly. That is the job Mr. O'Neill believed he was getting. Instead he found himself in what he appears to consider a figure-head position. <br />Paul O'Neill, who had been a budget adviser to both the Nixon, Ford, and the George H.W. Bush administrations, and had been a successful chief executive at Alcoa, was able to sift through economic data to his little heart's desire with his friend, Alan Greenspan. But he soon discovered that was pretty much the limit of what was expected of him. That and signing his name to newly minted money flowing out of the Treasury.<br />Along the way, O'Neill made more than few public statements that were contrary to the Administration's position, eventually leading to his being asked to resign. Mr. O'Neill slowly came to the conclusion that he was serving in an administration that would not let facts get in the way of policies set by a \\"praetorian guard\\" of ideologues surrounding the president. O'Neill found himself to in a subservient position to such insiders as Karl Rove, the man credited with putting Bush in the White House.<br />Noting many of the policy making decision problems, O'Neill recounts a conversation with Dick Chaney in which he said to Chaney, an old friend, \\"We need to be better about keeping politics out of the policy process.\\" But he was ignored. O'Neill states that he continually asked the Vice President to foster a more open policy-making process in the White House, but to no avail. O'Neill's actions apparently led others in the inner circle to doubt his loyalty to the President. As we learn, O'Neill finally realizes that Mr. Chaney is the leader of the inner circle, which apparently keepsfacts, be they about the deficit, steel tariffs or Iraq, from getting in the way of policy. <br />At the center of this book is a recurring, unasked question: Who's in charge here? The portrait of Bush painted by O'Neill is not particularly flattering. Bush nicknamed O'Neill \\"Pablo,\\" a nickname that irritated O'Neill, and their meetings appear to nearly always have been ineffectual. In the first of near-weekly one-on-one meetings between the two, O'Neill arrives prepared to spend an hour talking about the economy, tax cuts, and Social Security. And he does, pressing on with a monologue because the expressionless President barely says a word in response.<br />This lead O'Neill to question exactly what the President was up to. O'Neill states \\"I wondered, from the first, if the President didn't know the questions to ask. Or did his strategy somehow involve never showing what he thought?\\" O'Neill appears to have come to the conclusion that is the former, rather than the latter, that led to the President's stoicism.<br />O'Neill did have enough influence to stave off a tax cut on dividends, for a while anyway. But when the issue came up after the midterm elections, O'Neill told the administration that the country could not afford it, only to rebuffed by Chaney. Chaney is said to have stated: \\"Reagan proved deficits don't matter. We won the midterms. This is our due.\\" <br />He does note that at that meeting the President, who is depicted as having a hard time following the discussion, wonders whether he hasn't already given wealthy people enough of a break. But, when the question came up, it was immediately nipped in the bud by Rove. <br />O'Neill eventually came to believe that he, Christie Whitman and Colin Powell were essentially hired for cover by a president who had pledged to govern from the center, but really had no intention of doing so. O'Neill, a man who admired how President Bush's father, when faced with a dire fiscal outlook, had reneged on his \\"no new taxes\\"pledge, was and is clearly troubled at the lack of fiscal responsibility in the administration. Particularly given the fact it is a Republican administration.<br />O'Neill notes that both he and Mr. Greenspan were concerned that the bulk of the first round of tax cuts in 2001 could prove unaffordable if projected $5.6 trillion surpluses over the next decade turned out to be an illusion (as they did).  He states that he tried to get the President to agree to condition the phasing in of these cuts on the availability of surpluses to no avail. He further notes that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was concerned that the first Bush tax cut did not include \\"triggers\\" that would have shut down the transfer of $1.35 trillion back to taxpayers if the budget surplus was evaporating. Greenspan is quoted as saying, \\"Without the triggers, that tax cut is irresponsible fiscal policy.\\" <br />O'Neill can and has been criticized for some of his revelations, such as the Greenspan quote. No doubt some of those quoted in the book never imagined that statements they may have made would come back to haunt them in this fashion. But, conversely, O'Neill never imagined himself in this position and he now finds himself defending his reputation after his ouster by none other than his friend, Dick Chaney. But I also do not believe he has revealed anything that the American people do not have a right to be aware of in this book.<br />The White House is naturally upset that a departed cabinet member has provided such an intimate and devastating portrait of presidential decision-making, particularly in an election year. But O'Neill also feels betrayed by a White House that discouraged any serious fiscal policy discussions and had no problem sending him packing when he continually failed to tow the administration's line.<br />Of course, administration defenders are painting O'Neill as a man with an agenda (and, despite his denials, I think he does have a bit of an agenda), but there is evidence to indicate that much of what O'Neill claims is true. <br />Suskind reportedly sifted through some 19,000 documents and hours of interviews to present this eye-opening window into the Bush White House. He substantiates much of what is said throughout. But it does beg the question, how unfiltered is what is said? Both Suskind and O'Neill have denied having an agenda, but they do seem determined to paint the President as an empty suit. What's troubling is, even if only half of what is recounted is true, they may be right.	2004-02-01

Ostensibly a thinly veiled semi-biography of his own pro football experiences, the book, when originally issued, was considered scandalous as it exposed the underside of the professional football world.<br />At the center of the novel is Phil Elliot, a fairly talented tight end who relies on pain killers to get him through the season. He carouses with the quarterback, only to ultimately find that the man he considered his closest friend when not be there for him in the end, and downs alcohol and drugs with a sense of abandon. To Elliot's mind, he is a team player because of his willingness to play with pain, taking painful, burning shots of cortisone in his knees in order to practice and play. But to his coaches, he is a loose cannon who they will only tolerate so long as he is useful to the team.<br />Ultimately, Elliot loses the game he loves. He learns that his only real value to the team is his ability to perform and when the side issues with him outweigh his talent to catch a pass, he loses that which he loved above all else (even if he would not admit it to himself): the game.<br />If you've seen the movie, you've only gotten a taste of the novel. Gent has written other books, but this remains his best. The book exposed a raw nerve at the time of its first release and was decried in many corners as nothing more than the fanciful tirade of a embittered former player. Instead, over the years we've learned that Gent's revelations regarding sex, drugs, and alcohol abuse in the NFL were all too true. And despite stringent drug testing rules, all of the problems exposed in his novel are still present in the NFL today.	2004-01-31

BWS: STORYTELLER presented The Young Gods, The Paradoxman, and The Freebooters, three original series written and drawn by Windsor-Smith. I had been a Windsor-Smith since his days as Barry Smith at Marvel comics. I once even owned his infamous debut in the Uncanny X-Men (let's just say his art has come a long, long way from those days).<br />BSW:STORYTELLER collected several ongoing series by Windsor-Smith, including one known as the \\"Young Gods.\\" On it's surface it seemed highly derivative of Jack Kirby's \\"Thor\\" for Marvel, as well as his \\"New Gods\\" and \\"The Forever People of Supertown\\" for DC. But that was part of the trick to it all, at least I think it was. You were suppose to think Kirby and then watch as Windsor-Smith put his own little twists on the whole concept of beings who were considered gods.  <br />These were gods who were, as one editorial put it: \\"sexy, ribald, politically incorrect, and outrageously funny.\\" <br />The story begins on the eve of the wedding of Prince Heros, a somewhat reluctant groom, who decides he needs to go off carousing one more time before he is forced to settle down. He and his cousin, Strangehands, set out for a little adventure engaging in \\"dragon chasing.\\" Also along for the ride is the lovely but foul-mouthed Princess Adastra, sister of the bride-to-be. Things don't go quite as planned, of course. <br />Unfortunately, the series was never completed in its original run. But, this volume collects issues one through 9 plus the previously unpublished issues 10 and 11. It also adds new material created for this edition. Windsor-Smith is not for everyone's tastes, but if you are a fan, this is a must have for your collection.	2004-01-27

Kaplan didn't set out to chronicle the disappointment and wrath of so many dot-commers burned by the internet bubble. But one Memorial Day weekend in 2000, trying to kill some time,  Kaplan ( a web designer at the time) set up a site, F**kedcompany.com. The site offered the latest gossip about sinking dot-coms and even included an online betting pool on when companies would go under. Kaplan suddenly found himself thrust into the spotlight as a kind of overseer of the dot-com collapse.<br />And while Kaplan often refers to himself as an &quot;idiot&quot; throughout the book, he nonetheless clearly loves the hype generated by his website. He has been profiled by &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;Salon.com,&quot; and ABC News's &quot;20/20.&quot; among others. In this book, Kaplan offers capsule descriptions of about 150 of the looniest ideas and largest implosions. Kaplan reveals how many millions the companies burned through and gives, in sometimes clever but crude language, his sarcastic explanation for the failure of the many companies he skewers. <br />He garnered much of his information from the website. His website's betting pool assigned high scores to those submitting the best information about coming dot-com catastrophes. There was no actual monetary payout, winning is its own reward.) he was inundated with e-mails from employees, who were often angry, bitter, or just out to stick a knife in an occasional back, reporting rumors of pending layoffs, shutdowns, and bankruptcies. <br />As more companies failed, an almost sick fascination with the site grew, its notoriety spread, and disgruntled employees continued to send thousands of e-mails regarding various internet companies. The information often turned out to be accurate, that reading the postings was like knowing a train wreck was coming and having to set up near the tracks and watch. And people clearly loved watching company after company flameout and wreck.<br />The book spotlights many companies, among them: the sports site MVP.com, Webvan, and some you may never have heard of, such as little known Third Voice. Third Voice's pitch? It offered what amounted to virtual &quot;sticky notes&quot; which could be attached to websites. It had no real practical application, other than to potential muck up the websites of other businesses, yet investors poured some $15 million into the company.<br />Like his website, the book maintains a satirical tone which both amuses and irritates at times. The book may not be quite as timely as Kaplan might hope as there have been numerous other recent books which have chronicled the idiocy of the internet explosion. Still, Kaplan had a front row seat for much of the implosion, and it certainly makes for an entertaining read.	2004-01-27

To her credit, she keeps the chapters short and to the point and ends each with what she refers to as a &quot;$ummary $uccess $tory.&quot; The book is clear, concise, and east to read and follow. <br />Khalfani essentially notes that mistakes made by people in investing are fairly common to the majority of investors. She divides the book into five sections: strategizing your goals, buying, holding, selling, and dealing with investment intermediaries such as stock brokers.  She has an easy-to-read, friendly style of writing. The advice is basic, and more sophisticated investors will consider as remedial or average, at best, but for anyone who knows little about investing, it's a great starting point.<br />Her advice is solid throughout, and the piece of advice she considers most important is particularly good: Don't invest prematurely. By that she means you should have a stash of three-to-six months of expenses, a will, and disability insurance before you dive into investing. If you are new to investing, read this book first, you'll be glad you did.	2004-01-26

I loved all Terhune's books as a child and have tried to pick up hardcover editions when and where I can. Luckily, I managed to order this shortly after my first's daughter's birth in anticipation of the day when I could introduce her to Lad and the other dogs of Sunnybank. I have no doubt she will love all theses stories as I did.<br />Lad was a real collie who belonged to the author in the early part of the twentieth century. He was not Terhune's only dog, but he is the best known and best loved of all of them. And Terhune while wrote many tales for magazines of most of his dogs, Lad was always a favorite of the reading public. The stories were so popular that many eventually were collected into volumes such as this one.<br />Amazingly, Lad apparently lived less than ten years but packed a lot of living into that life. It is my understanding that a part of Sunnybank (which was Terhune's home) has been preserved to this day and it has the graves of Lad and other of the Sunnybank dogs there.<br />This book is essentially the further adventures of Lad, following up the success of \\"Lad: a Dog.\\" These stories are wonderfully told (even though Terhune thought himself a lousy writer) and are all the more compelling in that they are true. Truly Great reading for animal lovers of all ages.	2004-01-26

It is Crichton at his best-- detailed, well plotted, and well written-- and while I know it was a best seller when it came out, it just never seemed to garner the attention his more sci fi oriented books have.<br />A near disaster in the air leaves three people dead and nearly three dozen injured. Casey Singleton is sent by her hard-driving boss to uncover the mysterious circumstances that led to the disaster before more people die. But, as you might expect, someone doesn't want her to find the answers she is looking for and soon she is risking her life to unravel the mystery.<br />While Crichton has featured strong women in other books, Casey Singleton is, I believe, the first to actually be the lead character in the book. And she is truly a great character! More than just solving the mystery rides in her shoulders, the fate of the company she works for may depend on whether she can solve the mystery before someone sees to it that she is no longer around to try to sort things out.<br />Crichton probably does a better job of explaining the inner working of airliner manufacturing and the airline industry itself than most textbooks. Well there are echoes of \\"Disclosure\\" here, Crichton ably demonstrates that the most entertaining  intrigue is corporate intrigue.  A truly superior novel.	2004-01-24

REH created Kull prior to Conan, but had difficulty seling his stories. What few there are were sometimes far more involved and intricately plotted than the typical Conan tale. Since they didn't sell, REH came up with Conan and a few of Kull's tale actully were transformed into Conan stories.<br />One of those was &quot;By This Axe I Rule,&quot; which was loosely adapted to become &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword,&quot; as I recall. Some people actually prefer the character of Kull to Conan. Regardless, Kull is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	2004-01-24

Howard tales: &quot;Blood of the Gods,&quot; &quot;The Country of the Knife,&quot; and &quot;Son of the White Wolf.&quot; The latter two were published in 1936 following Howard's death. They are essentially desert epics featuring the character of Francis X. Gordon, an American who was known as El Borak. El Borak adventured about Kurdistan, Turkey, and Afghanistan.<br />The stories appear to take place fairly contemporaneously with Howard's life, even though El Borak frequently swings a pretty mean sword. Still, he also managed to carry a gun much of the time. The stories are fast paced and filled with action, typical REH work. Of course, what's typical for REH would be above average for most other writers. REH was truly the king of the pulps and produced an unbelievable amount of work in a relatively short time.<br />for anyone who follows REH, this is a must have. &quot;The Country of the Knife,&quot; in particular, is a great story. Roy Thomas liked it well enough to adapt it into a Conan story.	2004-01-23

Howard remains one of my favorite authors and it remains one of the great tragedies in literature that he killed himself at such a young age. I've read the bulk of his work and love most of it, but even REH can produce a stinker or two. He also occasionally could be highly derivative and average, particularly when he was writing outside the area of fantasy.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Almuric\\" is one of those derivative, average works, even though it is essentially a sci fi-fantasy tale. It also holds the distinction of being his only true novel, even though he did produce a few other novel length works, notably &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot; (a/k/a &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot;).<br />Now, I realize I'm in the minority on this opinion, and I think if you check my other reviews of REH's work you'll find I'm definitely not a Howard-hater. I truly love most of the man's work. Heck, as a kid he inspired nearly everything I wrote and, yes, as a kid I ripped him off a lot!<br />But throughout this work I kept thinking of Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"John Carter of Mars\\" series and found this book to be a rehash of a lot of Burroughs' work. To it's credit, the novel is still entertaining and interesting. And, hey, on his worst day REH was still a superior writer to 90 percent of other writers, particularly the hacks who haunt the fantasy and science fiction shelves these days.  <br />So I do recommend it, just be forewarned that if you've read any of the \\"John Carter\\" books, there may be a slight sense of déjà vu.	2004-01-22

This was the start of that phase and of the non-legal books he has published, it is probably the best. The story takes place in rural Arkansas in 1952 on the Chandler cotton farm. It's harvest time, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and &quot;hill people&quot; to pick cotton. <br />Trouble begins to brew between the Mexicans and the hill people, particularly during an impromptu baseball game. One of the hill people is particularly brutal and feared by nearly everyone. This all leads to his murder, which Luke, the seven-year old narrator of the book, has the misfortune of witnessing and not being able to tell what he saw out of fear for his life and his family's lives. Oddly, the murder does not overshadow the rest of the tale and it all reaches a rather odd, but somehow satisfying conclusion. The book in many ways is something of a rite of passage for Luke and his family as they come to realize that a way of life that they have known for years is coming to an end.<br />Grisham demonstrates here that he definitely has a flair for more than legal thrillers, and while this book is no &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; it still is a nice read about a time now past.	2004-01-21

As a pre-teen and teenager I was in love with the writing of Burroughs and Robert E. Howard, as well as their most famous characters, Tarzan and Conan, respectively. And I have had a lot of respect for the company controlling Burroughs's copyrights for not dumping a lot of Tarzan pastiches on the marketplace as has happened with Conan. But having watched hack after hack literally destroy Conan, my expectations for this book were fairly low.<br />Fortunately, I was somewhat surprised. While it definitely lacks Burroughs's tone in many places, it's relatively true to the original character. Lansdale appears to be a decent enough writer and I think he has a lot of respect for the Tarzan mythos. He wisely introduces one of my favorite characters into the storyline, Jad-Bal-Ja (the golden lion), but I ultimately wasn't overly impressed with what I considered the science fiction aspects of the story, e.g., the bug-like monster.<br />Not that Burroughs didn't frequently troll the waters of science fiction in Tarzan, it just seemed to lack a degree of originality.  The downer ending was also something of an oddity. Admittedly, \\"Tarzan of the Apes,\\" the one that started it all, had a downer ending, but for the most Burroughs generally wrapped up his Tarzan stories with a semblance of \\"everything is now right in the world.\\" Okay, so maybe I'm being picky.<br />I do recommend this book. It is an entertaining read and is never boring. I guess anyone who tries to pick up where my favorite authors left off is usually going to face some negative criticism.	2004-01-20

Unfortunately, it's not much of a tribute. Fortunately, it is supposed to be the final Hemingway work, so maybe the &quot;picking at Papa's bones&quot; has finally come to an end. <br />Posthumous publications always raise the question of what would the author have wanted. Would Hemingway have wanted this book to see publication, particularly given the fact that it is need of heavy editing? I have my doubts that he ever intended for this book to see publication. He had shelved this project himself prior to his death and nothing I've read indicates he had any desire to see it to completion. <br />The book is characterized as &quot;A Fictional Memoir,&quot; and, rather than seeming to have been intended as a complete novel in and of itself, the book appears to be more of a collection of material out of which a novel might have been constructed. Hemingway began work on it in 1954, and it essentially describes Hemingway's trip to Kenya with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh. The line between what is fiction and what is memoir is fairly ambiguous throughout.  <br />Fans of Hemingway, such as myself, will be disappointed. There is no real plot or dramatic structure and what suspense there is, e.g., will Miss Mary kill her lion?, is disposed of before the book is half over. The book, which is reputed to have been edited down from over 800 pages, is in severe need of additional editing. Hemingway, who was famous for his self-editing, probably would have sheared off at least another quarter of the book.<br />Still, there is enough of the old master present here to make it worth reading if you are a fan.	2004-01-20

As a pre-teen and teenager, it was my favorite Tarzan book simply because of Jad-Bal-Ja, the golden lion of the title. Heck, I had a pet dog I ran around with; Tarzan got to run around with a lion.<br />In the book, Tarzan finds himself in Opar, a remnant of the lost city of Atlantis (he's bee here before in &quot;Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar&quot;). He's not exactly a popular guy in Opar and is rescued from certain death (is there any other kind in these books) by La, the High Priestess of Opar who just happens to be in love with Tarzan. They are forced to flee together into the Valley of Diamonds, which just happens to be ruled by some very nasty gorillas. Fortunately for Tarzan, Jad-bal-ja is on his trail and arrives in the nick of time. <br />While this is still a favorite of mine, it contains a plot twist that I always thought was one of ERB's worst. Estaban Miranda is a Spaniard, who happens to look just like Tarzan, and somehow keeps managing to fool a lot of other characters. It just never made much sense that even if he looked like Tarzan, he could so easily get away with imitating the Lord of the Jungle.	2004-01-20

Books	2	107	117	N	N	Sorry, Just Not Much Substance Here	First, let's start by saying that the underlying principle of this book is an excellent one: If you give and do so in a giving spirit, you will, in turn, be given much more. Mr. Vitale posits that this principle is a universal one; in fact, he seems to claim it is a universal law. That being said, Mr. Vitale takes a decent idea that probably only merited an article and tries to stretch it into a book length work. And, unfortunately, not a very good one at that. <br />The chapters are all essentially short vignettes, and not all of them are even by Mr. Vitale. Many of them are repetitious and almost condescending in tone. For example, Mr. Vitale at one point addresses the problem of why someone who gives would not receive anything in return. Naturally the answer is: you didn't give in the right spirit so you received nothing in return.<br />Part of what bothers me here is that Mr. Vitale is taking a concept found in many religions and acting as if he has discovered some secret that no one else was previously aware of. As a Christian, I almost find his method of co-opting the concept of \\"it is better to give than receive,\\" and turning it into a money-making proposition, insulting. But I don't wan to turn this into a religious argument, so let's move on.<br />I've had a curiosity about Mr. Vitale and his status as a marketing genius for several months. His name started turning up in my e-mail from some writing buddies of mine. He apparently now is \\"Dr. Vitale,\\" (I guess he picked up a doctorate or something somewhere) and he has the nickname \\"Mr. Fire.\\" I think it is a self-declared nickname, but even if so, it's not necessarily a name that has any real meaning. He also advocates \\"spiritual marketing\\" and \\"hypnotic writing.\\" <br />Well, the writing in this book is pretty basic and if it is hypnotic in some way, I guess I'm just too dumb to be hypnotized (no doubt, if any of his fans reply to this review they'll jump on that statement). The spirituality is pretty looseand rootless (although one of the other authors of a chapter does at least give credit to God) and all of it seems to be aimed at one thing: making money. His message just seems disingenuous in that everything is built around gaining wealth. <br />Given the hype I had read about Mr. Vitale, particularly from a writer I know who swears by him, I had expected much, much more. I guess unless you are an adherent of Mr. Vitale, there's just not a whole lot of substance here. Sorry, Mr. Vitale, perhaps one of your other works will change my mind.	2004-01-19

The reality is, the book probably provides a realistic portrayal of how an older child can find their wants set aside because there is a new born in the house. Ms. Cousins resolution appears to be to have the older child realize that they can help with, and play with, their new sibling just like the adults do.<br />But, while realistic, I'm not so sure it's a good message for young children. My oldest daughter does not particularly like this book. I'm not sure if it's because it sends a message that she should subsume who own ego, wants, and needs to those of her younger sister or if she just doesn't find it interesting. Of course, four year olds don't necessarily feel a need to provide commentary on why or shy not they don't want a book.<br />The book is also troubling in that the parents seem so oblivious to Za-Za's needs. Not a good message to be sending to older siblings.<br />As with all her books, Ms. Cousins's art is simple, but colorful and effective. I just believe a better message would be sent had she shown some signs throughout the book that the parents were not so oblivious to Za-Za.	2004-01-15

I just believe it takes a really unique individual to convey their story as objectively as possible. But, my wife's best friend, Sarah, gave this book to me about a year ago (she loves Warner and the Rams) and I've finally gotten around to reviewing it.<br />To his credit, Warner is very upfront about a lot of things, notably his religion. He is a very devote Christian and it is nice to see someone stand up for their beliefs in an age where a lot of people literally hide their beliefs. And his story is rather compelling; a quarterback who came from nowhere to lead his team to an NFL championship.<br />But, there's a recurring problem with these books. They always seem very rushed and it seems that either the winning coach or the winning quarterback from the Super Bowl each year is expected to hurry their life story onto the market. The problem is, these guys generally still have a lot of life left to live, so why not wait until they are retired (as in retirement age, not just retired from their sport) to tell us their life story? I know, I know, in fifty years no one may even rember Kurt Warner, so I guess you strick while the iron is hot. But I would almost much rather read about how he is dealing with his current struggles in the NFL, rather than culminating with his crowning moment.<br />Like most of these type books, it's relatively short on intropestion. But it is a bit above average for an athlete's autobiography, made more interesting by the struggles Warner and his wife faced before he finally made it in the NFL. If you are a fan of Warner, you'll love it. Otherwise, its an okay read on a day at the beach.	2004-01-14

Allen can be seen in adveertisements in which he is essentially continuing the challenge in this book: that he can make anyone a successful real estate investor. Seems to me that it's getting to be an old story, but this is where he first put his reputation where his mouth is. <br />To Allen's credit, he did not back down from this challenge. Three &quot;students&quot; are chosen to be taught by Allen and to apply his preinciples so that within 90 days they will each own property and have $5000 in the bank. Only one succeeds in this endeavor, but the others certainly didn't fail for lack of effort.<br />The book actualyl does read like anovel, and you will find yourself rooting for these people as they attempt to succeed as real estate investors. I doubt any other real estate gurus would take the risk Allen takes here and, well he achieved mixed results, you come away with a sense that his principels and ideas do work, they just might need more time to come to fruition.<br />I'm still dubious of buying real estate with no money down, but it does seem to work for some people. and this book will never bore you.	2004-01-14

Hemingway immediately came to mind, but then the question was, which one? I finally decided on this, which may well be my favorite Hemingway work.<br />Even though it was published posthumously, this book does not reek of other hands having been all over it as have some other posthumous Hemingway publications. It has been questioned as to how much of this book is fact and how much fiction. Even Hemingway raised the issue at the beginning of the book. It doesn't really matter. In this book Hemingway is recollecting events that occurred over roughly a five year period which were over thirty years past when he started on the book.  So, no doubt of it may well be fiction, given the passage of time.<br />But the book is monumental in that it is perhaps the quietest and most elegant of Hemingway's books. It is broken into chapters that recount various episodes in his life during that period he dwelled largely in Paris. It is sometimes funny, occasionally sad, but always intriguing. As I write this, I'm slowly convincing myself that it is my favorite work by him.<br />We are introduced to Hemingway's circle of friends and acquaintances from that period: Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, and the always interesting F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. It's amazing how many other literary figures Hemingway came in contact with during his life and he gives interesting tales of all of them.<br />Even if you normally dislike Hemingway, I truly believe you will love reading this memoir. A true literary triumph and recounting of a time like none we will ever see again.	2004-01-14

I'm not sure why because Seth Godin has written better books and it's not like he necessarily needs to go the gimmicky &quot;look-at-me, look-at-me&quot; route to sell books.<br />All Godin has done here is write a book on branding an positioning.  Godin is trying very hard here to sell us on the idea that what he suggests is new and different and that the old ways of marketing do not work. Hate to tell him this, but talk to people who are genuinely out there fighting for customers in the marketplace and you find that the old ways still work quite well. P&amp;G has managed to stay pretty successful (not that they don't have an occasional bump in the road) sticking to a tired-and-true marketing formula, as have many other companies.<br />This book is simply about product or service differentiation that attracts attention (as a purple cow in a field of brown ones would). It's not necessarily new and different, and some of his example s may well be flawed. For example, JetBlue is a marvelous success (and I wish that would come to our part of the country), but all they did was build on the Southwest Airlines template for success. JetBlue also had the marked advantage of being one of the best financed start-ups in airline history. I think their success is more the result of good management more than anything else. And for the most part, Godin seems to use examples of companies that are now well-established in the marketplace, e.g., Starbucks, HBO and Krispy Kreme. While I think he's use of JetBlue does not necessarily support his premise, at least it is a relatively new entity. Why did he not use more examples of newer companies? Would that not have supported his &quot;Purple Cow&quot; premise more readily? Too much of what Godin is writing about here is reminiscent of the internet boom and busts, where so many companies were simply about an eye-catching marketing idea rather than a good business plan and business model.<br />That is an essential flaw in the overall premise also. Just standing out is not enough to make a company profitable and successful. Corporate history is replete with companies that stood out and then quickly flamed out. A company still needs to be well managed and actually have a product or service people are interested in. Godin has written better books with better ideas. This one simply seems to be based on a gimmick with little substantive evidence behind it.	2004-01-14

Kanon introduces many of us to a story most of us know little about-- the development of the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico. <br />Kanon does a fine job of painting a picture of the time and place, as it is Spring 1945 and the scientists and soldiers at Los Alamos are nearing the time of the first test explosions of the atomic bomb (in a passage in the book, Kanon stunning describes the explosion of the A Bomb as scientists and soldiers look on, many not even realizing what the advent of the A Bomb would mean or how it would affect them).<br />Against this backdrop, a security officer, Karl Bruner, assigned to Los Alamos, has been murdered and Michael Connolly, an intelligence officer, has been sent in to solve it. Connolly must carefully navigate the secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project while attempting to solve the mystery of Bruner's death.<br />Along the way, he meets such luminaries tied to the project as Robert Oppenheimer (this book made me wish I could find a good biography on him). The conclusion is not totally satisfying as I did not find the resolution of the murder totally convincing, but the journey to that resolution is well worth the trip.	2004-01-13

This novel starts a few years later, during the height of the McCarthy red scare in the 1950s and then mvoes forward some twenty years to its conclusion.<br />Nick Kotlar, all of ten years old, is caught up in the  McCarthy hearings when his father is suspected of being a spy. When a key witness dies, his father flees the country and settles behind in the Soviet Union. Nick is devastated by his father's actions and his mother later marries a close ffriend of the family. In many ways, the opening chapters are the most compelling as we watch a child deal with the confusion surrounding his father's defection.<br />Years later, the adult Nick is contacted by his father to help him come home by finding the important, and still active spy, who actually was behind his father's fleeing, a move apparently orchestrated to protect the spy from detection.  This sets up what starts as an intriguing mystery, but unfortunately it becomes fairly obvious who is behind the entire plot along the way. Nonetheless, there are a few surprising twists, especially near the end, although the book is not quite as satisfying as \\"Los Alamos.\\"<br />Still, this is a fine story and Kanon has a good ear for dialogue that is credible and realistic. Enjoy it for what it is, a rather satisfying mystery set in the Cold War era.	2004-01-13

I first discovered Albert Payson Terhune and Lad in seventh grade, much to the chagrin of our school librarian. She had to eventually temporarily ban me from checking the book out any further so that other kids could read it. In those days I did not realize I was reading about a long dead author and the most famous of his dogs, nor did I realize that the stories actually were taking place in the early part of the 20th century. <br />None of that mattered to me then (or now for the matter). I was drawn into the world of Lad and Terhune every time I opened those pages. Eventually, I managed to read most of his works and came to truly admire Terhune's writing, even though I have since read that he considered himself to be a hack.<br />It's now many years later, and there is still magic in these books for me. I have several of the books waiting for the day my very young daughters (a two year old and a four year old) are ready to read books that don't have pictures on every page. In fact, I've got a backlog of books I want to share with them, but I'm willing to bet we start with Lad.<br />If your children have any interest in animals in general or dogs in particular, you must get this book, and all of Terhune's other works if you can find them, for your children.

Believe me, if you're the latter, you could write a really great paper based on this book.<br />The book is a collection of eight case studies by various authors, each examining the relationship between various airline executives and the federal government during the period of time the government heavily regulated the airline industry (roughly 1926 to 1978). <br />In all likelihood, sufficient time has passed for most people to have forgotten what airlines were like in the time of federal regulation. Some have even called for a reinstituion of regulation,but unlike W. David Lewis, the editor fo the book, I do not believe the government will ever attempt regulation again. If it were going to do so, it probably would have done so in the wake of the 9/11 crisis and its affect on the airlines.<br />The book does an excellent job of covering various types of airlines and their relationships with the government, with a focus on executives from the various airlines.<br />The executives profiled are among some of the most prominent characters to have passed through the industry, and this is an industry that has had more than its fair share of characters. Some had adversarial relationships with the government during the time of federal regualtion; others thrived in the regulated environment. <br />Interestingly, some of th airlines documented and featured no longer exist. Eastern Airlines, for example, was an airline that ultimately failed once dereguation took place, although its doom may have been more the fault of its chief executive at the time and his adversarial relationships with his labor unions (for more on this, see the book &quot;Hard Landing&quot;).<br />The book itself does not draw any final conclusions, leaving any ultimate conclusion to the reader. I would love to see a follow-up, with a further examination of other airline executives and their relationships with the government both during and after federal regulation.<br />A great scholarly work, but definitely not for the casual reader.	2004-01-11

It even is of benefit to seasoned financial people who don't necessarily spend a lot of time reviewing financial statements.<br />It covers quite a bit of information in a relatively small number of pages: taxation, inventories, cash flow, depreciation, capital investments, and even intangibles like Research and Development and market position. It is well organized and presented in plain Englsih, much to its credit. <br />However, keep in mind that this is more of a starting point. If you plan on spending a lot of time doing indepth analysis of financial statements, I would recommend starting with this book to provide the basics and then moving on to a more technical and detailed volume. You might want to pick an accounting and/or finance course along the way, too.	2004-01-11

I've never read the previous edition, but having seen its cover, I wish they had kept the same cover. But I guess that's a fairly minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.  <br />To its credit, the \\"Book\\" goes beyond just advising on how to put a book  (a.k.a. a portfolio to people outside advertising) together. It also offers advice on the job search and interviewing, among other things. A little over a third of the Book is Ms. Paetro's advice.  The remaining two thirds consists of advice from numerous advertising veterans, some of them very recognizable names in the industry. <br />The Book itself is kind of an oddity in design. It's somewhat oversized, roughly 8\\" by 11 ½,\\" and is designed to look like a portfolio. Clever, but I prefer the earlier edition's cover. Most of the type inside is oversized also (14 point?), making it a relatively fast, easy read. The advice appears sound and useful, although the advertising industry is notoriously tough to break into even under the best of circumstances. But my guess is anyone using the advice in this book will have a leg up on others.<br />Whether you are a college student soon to be pounding the street in search of work, or a pro seeking to make a lateral or upward move, there is good advice in here for you. And given some of the names recommending it, it may actually prove to be great advice.	2004-01-10

Thank God for whatever teacher it was who made us read it. I am currently a practicing lawyer, and I have to admit that I was influenced in part to become an attorney by none other than Atticus Finch.<br />The book is such a fantastic examination of people's prejudices, fears, and hatreds, no doubt far more scholarly people than myself have examined it and analyzed it to pieces. But it does expose so many raw nerves for so many people: the pettiness of bigotry by whites against blacks during the depression, the fear of the unknown in the person of Boo Radley, the sheer injustice of the all-white jury convicting Tom Robinson...and through it all, we are treated to the quiet dignity of Atticus Finch.<br />The story is essentially told through the eyes of Scout, an intelligent but often guileless young girl who is frankly confused by the prejudice that rears its ugly head when Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, the daughter of a violent drunk white farmer.<br />Scout's love for her father is apparent throughout the book, particularly when she watches him remain quietly courageous in the face of ever growing town anger at the prospect of Atticus defending Robinson. But there is not necessarily a happy ending here. The story is bittersweet, Atticus does not save the day for Robinson, but Scout is rescued from potential harm from an unexpected corner and learns that one should never judge anyone by appearances alone.<br />A true, timeless classic which I have re-read several times over the years. Anyone who is not moved by this book is quite plainly an idiot.	2004-01-09

And he was among my favorite players. The nickname was a reference to Rose's all-out play and determination (this was guy that ran to first base even when he got a walk). With the publication of this book, it's clear he is still Charlie Hustle, only the hustle is a completely different kind that he's trying to run by the public at large.<BR> <BR>In his forward, Rose explains that he's finally confessing to betting on baseball because \\"it's time\\" and because someone \\"else might benefit.\\" But as you read the book, it becomes apparent very quickly exactly who is meant to benefit-- Pete. After all, it's no secret Rose has been hustling for money for years and he reportedly received a one million dollar advance for this book. Sadly, it's clearly an autobiography intended to sell the public on granting absolution, with as little contriteness as possible.<br />Ross was banned from baseball in 1989 for his gambling activities. For years he denied it, excoriating others who accused him of having done so.  Why 14 years later it is suddenly time to come clean, other than for the money and the chance to be reinstated in baseball, is beyond me. And if this is supposed to be a confession, it sure is an odd one. The book acts more as a rationalization for Rose's actions, going so far as to try to justify some of Rose's actions by having a doctor state Rose is a textbook case of ADHD attention disorder. Heck, he even gets into blaming his childhood teachers because they didn't understand him. Please...<br />  Rose occasionally musters enough self-respect to say that he blames himself for his problems, but that rings pretty hollow in light of all the other pages spent pointing fingers at others. He does admit to betting on baseball four to eight times a week, including games he was managing,  but almost seems to brush off criticism by saying he never bet against his team ortried to fix a game (after 14 years of lying, why should we believe him now?). <br />Rose appears to be going for some form of martyrdom, but with as little personal sacrifice as possible. He tries to play the victim throughout the book when in fact he victimized others. It's probably noteworthy that he never really bothers to apologize to those who have been lambasted for raising the issue of his cheating in the past. <br />Ultimately, it's not a very well written book, either. (I don't know who Rick Hill is, but he might want to leave this one off his resume). The book is so slanted that it really cannot be accepted as a true autobiography. <br />Thankfully, I did not have to pay full price for it.	2004-01-09

The thing is, I wish the authors had dug a lot deeper. Other airlines have been jealous of Southwest's success and its relationship with its customers and employees for years. And no noe seems ot be able to get to the bottom line of what they do oprationally and financially that makes them a success. Maybe there is nothing more, it's all just a matter of oeprating efficiently and keeping employess and customers happy.<br />In fact, many start-up airlines now use Southwest as their template for operating. The authors do a good job of reviewing the history of the company (at least up to the point of publication) and discussing the operations of the airline, but they just don't seem to dig deep enough. Maybe what is needed is someone with a strong financial background to do a comparison of Southwest's methods directly with those of its competitors, because I would really like to see the difference from a financial analysis standpoint (then again, that might be an awfully boring book). <br />My only other negative criticism of the book is that it almost turns into a fluff piece, cheerleading a little too heavily for Southwest. But that is almost understandable. After all, Southwest has rarely made a misstep in all its years of operations.<br />Regardless, this is a very good look at a truly wonderful operation. Well worth reading if you have an interest in the airline industry.	2004-01-08

I was trying to buy stocks and usually failed to do so simply because I did not want to pay broker fees and I was rarely in a position to buy 100 shares at a time (if you bought less, the stock price and the broker fee both usually went up). Back then, the book was a great aid. I still own a stock list in the book that I purchased thanks to this book.  <br />But in many ways, this book has lost a lot of relevance. Now one can go online and purchase stocks in any amount with fees of as little as $3.00. And the fact that the book has not been updated since 1996 weighs heavily against recommending it be purchased by anyone today. Perhaps Carlson has not bothered to further update because of the ease with which stocks may eb purchased on-line.<br />Still, for someone who is a long term investor, it provides some choices as far as investing without involving a broker. And it is definitely an option if you have no desire to use the internet to make stock purchases. Just be aware that your options are limited; most companies do not offer direct purchase of their stock or Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) to the public at large.	2004-01-08

A copywriter with a social conscious who eventually started his own agency and officed in a Firehouse in San Francisco. <BR>He introduced the world to Marshall McLuhan, helped start Friends of the Earth, and was instrumental in a number of other socially aware organizations that emerged in the sixties. He was in many ways the anti-ad man, a writer who frequently used humor to great advantage, poking fun at the products he advertised, and probably can be credited with introducing the idea of using humor as a sales tool in advertising.<br />Unfortunately, he died in 1969 from leukemia, but his influence lives on in advertising to this day. After this book was published, Howard Gossage was essentially rediscovered and he was named one of the Top 100 Ad People of the Century (20th Century, that is). <br />If you are involved in creative advertising, read this book. Heck, put it under your pillow and sleep on it. Maybe osmosis actually works.	2004-01-08

They believed they had developed a can't fail system of playing small margins in bond and equity spreads. They even projected that only a unique set of circumstances could ever fall into place and spoil the niche they thought they had found in the market. And the odds of that happening were determined to be so infinitesimal that they never were concerned about it.<br />Naturally, that unique set of circumstances fell into place and brought them down at the same time very nearly ignited a financial crisis that required the intervention of the Federal Reserve to prevent a potential meltdown of the markets. It reads like fiction by the likes of Michael Crichton, but it is all the more frightening that it is true. <br />This is a true cautionary tale, one that will probably go unheeded by future \\"geniuses\\" on the Street. It is well researched and well-told. This book is must reading for anyone interested in the stock and bond markets. It should be required reading for all of the self-proclaimed financial geniuses who keep appearing on Wall Street and who all seem to manage to flame out when they learn that the markets are unpredictable and answer to no one.	2004-01-08

Bly have written a well-organized and concise guide to copywriting. While not nearly as comprehensive as Bly's &quot;The Copywriter's Handbook,&quot;(which you also get if you are buying this book), &quot;The Elements of Copywriting&quot; is a great introduction to copywriting for most people. It covers a number of areas of copywriting: display advertising, direct mail, brochures, catalogs, press releases, press kits, audiovisual promotions, Web-site material, and more. <br />It quickly and deftly outlines the differences between copywriting and other writing, e.g., it's perfectly acceptable to use &quot;And&quot; to begin sentences in advertising copy. Blake and Bly address each type of copywriting task mentioned above individually, as well as providing more broad-based rules for copywriting: use a conversational, friendly tone; use simple words and short sentences;focus on the customer, not the product; and close with a &quot;call to action.&quot; <br />This is a very concise guide to copywriting that is an excellent starting point for those wanting to learn the craft.	2004-01-07

The book covers Roosevelt's White House years, following his ascension to the presidency after McKinley is killed, and gives wonderful insight into one of America's greatest presidents. Roosevelt essentially began the idea of the strong, involved president (since Lincoln's assassination, nearly all the presidents had been largely figure-heads in nature), and he is probably one of the most influential men of the twentieth century. <br />Morris provides an in depth look at what Roosevelt accomplished in his two terms. He created the Department of Interior, protecting more land for posterity than any other president before or since. After reading a book written by Sinclair Lewis about the unsanitary conditions in the meat packing industry, He created the Food and Drug Administration . He mediated the treaty between the Russians and the Japanese after the Russo-Japanese War and as a result became the first president to be awarded the Nobel peace prize. He built our Navy into a world power, preparing the United States for its entry onto the scene as a   super power. He was the force that drove the building of the Panama Canal. Roosevelt may well have been the single greatest president to ever serve in the office. If not, then when they call role for the great ones, there aren't too many names in front of him.<br />In his lifetime, he also authored over 30 books, was fluent in at least six languages, and was a remarkably astute politician even before his rise to the presidency. Roosevelt also wrote the famous poem (I think it would be considerd a poem) entitled, \\"The Man in the Arena.\\" In reality, he was the \\"Man in the Arena.\\"	2004-01-06

These days I rarely read fiction, and when I do, it's usually because it is blending fictional characters with actual events. This book does a capable job of this, but I just wish there was a little more to it.<br />Liss certainly gets off to a rousing start and the novel is fairly intriguing most of the way. But it just seems to gradually lose steam as it moves along, particularly as the main character, Ben Weaver, just seems to become less interesting as things progress.<br />Weaver finds himself involved in what would become the world's first famous stock scandal, involving the South Sea Company, which was a kind of precursor of things to come in stocks. It was the first bubble stock, rising to incredible value and suddenly crashing down and taking a lot of fortunes with it.<br />Had the scandal actually been a more integral part of the plot, I might have liked the book better. and the ultimate resolution just wasn't all that compelling. <br />Still, this is an interesting, entertaining above-average read. Liss does a credible job of recreating the time period. I just would have liked to see more details about the South Sea Company Bubble scandal.	2004-01-06

But she also seems to spend a little too much time patting herself on the back and occassionally becoming to harsh. I don't know, maybe she was going for a brutally honest approach. It does work at times but it also is off putting at other times.<br />She does offer some ideas that others don't really cover in their books.

My only complaint would be that it does not seem to give as much attention to his post-presidential years as I would have liked, but still, anyone reading this will have an opportunity to get to know intimately one of our greatest presidents.<br />The book is never dull (how could it be considering the subject?), and if you want the entire life of Theodore Roosevelt gathered in one volume, this is probably the best book of its kind.	2004-01-06

Ogilvy even claimed it changed his life (in advertising anyway, but who knows, advertising is Ogilvy's life). The book is amazing in both its simple and direct approach. It's relatively short, yet packed with information of use to anyone interested in advertising.<br />Hopkins essentially invented many of the concepts that so many advertisers take for granted today, chief among them what seems like a simple idea: the coupon. And even today, many advertisers fail to get results when they stray from his teachings.   <br />One of the most famous examples of failing to follow his teachings: the \\"Got Milk\\" campaign. Sure, it seems clever and it's definitely high profile, but from a marketing standpoint, it's a flop. Milk sales have not moved upward at all despite the fact that milk producers are now several years into the campaign. Want to know why it failed? Read Hopkins's book.<br />Whether you are an individual considering a career in advertising or an businessperson trying to figure out how best to market your business, start with Hopkins and then move onto the rest. <br />All advertising before \\"Scientific Advertising\\" flows into it; and all advertising after \\"Scientific Advertising\\" flows out of it.	2003-12-22

Ogilvy knows that an ad campaign, no matter how visually wonderful it may be, must do one thing: sell. <br />Ogilvy understands that advertising is fairly synonymous with sales, a fact that far too many advertisers and ad people alike seem to keep forgetting. Witness the mindless glut of ads that ran during the internet boom, read Ogilvy and Hopkins, and you'll understand why so many internet companies died on the vine when they couldn't attract customers. Admittedly, a number of internet companies lacked a true product or service to sell, but most did not do themselves any favors with their advertising.<br />Whether you are new to advertising or a seasoned pro, this book is a must have.	2003-12-22

He is sort of looked upon as the trailblazer, the guy who laid out the roadmap for people who want to write but not have to starve by doing so.<br />Peter Bowerman, author of &quot;The Well Fed Writer,&quot; gives Bly all the credit in the world for essentially being his &quot;muse&quot; in regard to copywriting. Aside: &quot;Well Fed,&quot; is a slightly better book, although I recommend you read both.<br />Bly does a great job of laying out what copywriting entails, what you will need to do the job, and how to become a copywriter. All great information. But I have two problems with the book (just don't let these problems dissuade you from reading it).<br />First, the book is very light on advice on obtaining clients. Bly touches on it, gives some advice, but ultimately there is a lot to be desired in advice on finding work.  Bowerman's book does a better job in this area, although even he doesn't provide any magic formula that will have clients lining up at the door to hire you. Hint: you've got to work to find the work; just no way around it. <br />Second, and this is a problem I have with every book or program out there that seems to indicate everyone and anyone can become a copywriter: It just ain't so, folks! Pardon the poor grammar, but that's part of the problem.<br />A sizeable chunk of our population is clueless about how to write anything, much less advertising and marketing copy. I think before a lot of people assume they can read this book, become a freelance writer, and suddenly start earning enormous amounts of money, they are going to need to go back to school and develop an understanding of basic grammar.<br />But, in part, that is what creates value for freelance writers. They do something that most other people actually can't, even though many people believe they could do it if they just took the time. <br />So, I have a problem with the promise that almost anyone can become a freelance writer. But if you have a decent grasp of grammar and a little creativity, you probably can and this book will be an excellent place to seek help in starting out.<br />Just be aware, you will probably want to pick up some of Bly's other books on copywriting that actually explain the process of writing effective copy.	2003-12-05

This is one of my favorite Hemingway books and one of the few published posthumously that lives up to his legacy.  <br />The book, broken into three distinct sections, recounts chapters in the life of Thomas Hudson, a somewhat thinly veiled version of Hemingway. That's not to say that this is a story about Hemingway himself, but its pretty clear there is a lot of Hemingway in Hudson. <br />The first section, considered by many to be the best (and, as a I recall, the focus of the film made of the book), takes place in Bimini, where Hudson is leading a fairly idyllic life. The second is centered in Cuba but has an entirely different tone from that of the first. Whereas the \\"Bimini\\" section is almost light-hearted and somewhat breezy, the tone of the Cuba section has changed dramatically. Hudson is now a depressed individual having lost a son in an accident. He has a reunion with his first wife, but even though she is the love of his life, he knows it won't end happily. The third part, \\"At Sea,\\" recounts Hudson's efforts as a Nazi sub hunter.<br />Hemingway is at his best throughout much of the book, his men are all striving to prove that they are, well, men, or at least the ideal of what a man should be in Hemingway's eyes. And naturally enough, no Hemingway man, in this case Hudson, would be complete without a little tragedy in his life. \\"At Sea,\\" while powerfully told, seems somehow incomplete, which may well be the case since I do not think Hemingway completed the book before his death. In fact, the ending seemed extremely abrupt and left me wondering, did Hudson survive his wounds?   <br />Still, this is some of Hemingway's best work. A must read. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the abrupt ending and a few other brief passages in the book that seem somehow incomplete and unfinished.	2003-10-24

I've never been able to find anything written by him other than &quot;My Brother, Ernest Hemingway,&quot; and that was a fairly average read. Other than some insights and background it possessed to which only Leicester might ever have been privy it wasn't particularly noteworthy.  Still, that book did hint that the talent in the family stretched beyond Ernest, and now Hilary Hemingway comes along to prove that fact.<br />This book has been attacked in some quarters as being pure fiction and, unfortunately, Hilary destroyed the only evidence that might have help prove that the source of the many tales therein was indeed her father, Leicester Hemingway. The tales recounted within are reputedly those left behind by her father on an audiocassette. But Hilary destroyed the only copy which is, admittedly odd, given that the tapes also apparently helped her to come to terms with her relationship with her father.<br />Hilary came into possession of the tape some fifteen years after her father commited suicide, a suicide which further added to the tragedy and myth of mental illness leading to suicide being an inherited trait in the family. Leicester was prompted to commit suicide when he lost his legs to diabetes. Hilary stuggled for years to forgive him.<br />This book recounts both stories of her father's adventuring (some with his more famous brother, Ernest, and some on his own)and the story of the process of how she came to grips with her father's decision to commit suicide. It is a book both about her father's life and her personal process of healing after his death. As we see in reading this book, which is actually relatively short, Hilary is a very talented writer. Although I should point out her husband, Jeffrey Lindsay, was a co-author on this book so where Hilary's work begins and ends is not certain. <br />Regardless, its a very compelling read whether the stories of her father are fiction ornot. Frankly, most of them sound very plausible (a few do stretch the limits of credibility) and I guess we will just have to take her word that Leicester did indeed leave a recording containing these stories. <br />I only hope we have not heard the last from Hilary Hemingway because she appears to have a true talent for writing.	2003-10-22

After reaching adulthood, he leaves the fishing village he was raised in and moves to Tokyo where he is sometimes overwhelmed by the city and is constantly exposed to the influences of American culture. <br />Brown draws us into Toshi's world as Toshi deals not only with his adjustment to life on his own but also to the separation of his parents, a separation which eventually leads Toshi to a family secret that had never even been hinted about to him.<br />This is a highly unique look into the life of a young man struggling with his culture and the influences of other cultures. And it is highly recommended. Brown does an incredible job of bringing all the characters in this novel to life. If you are looking for something different and even a little quirky to read, pick up a copy of &quot;Audrey Hepburn's Neck,&quot; you won't be disappointed.	2003-10-04

What is it about southern writers, particularly those from Mississippi (a state that continues to have one of the highest illiteracy rates in the world), that leads them to be such masterful story tellers? <br />This book was first published in 1967, but it still resonates beautifully today. Here Morris recounts his childhood in Mississippi, his time at the University of Texas, his days as a writer covering the wild Texas political scene, and his life as a transplanted Southerner adapting to life in New York (where at age 32 he became the editor of &quot;Harper's).&quot;<br />Morris brilliantly captures the changing environment in the United States as he traces his life in the forties, fifties, and sixties. Its too bad Morris died relatively young at 65, because I would have loved to see what else he had to write had he lived into his eighties or nineties. <br />This is about as good as an autobiography can get, as Morris examines not only his only personal growth over a thirty some-odd year period, but also reveals much about the changing political and social environment of those times.	2003-10-02

As an aspiring freelancer, I've looked at a number of books and other resources in an attempt to try to do it right the first time and not needlessly waste time and money trying to segue into a writing career. <br />Of all the resources I've viewed, this is easily the most comprehensive, but don't quit your day job just yet. The book does an excellent job of explaining how to organize and start a copywriting business, however, as noted by at least one other reviewer, Bowerman had his initial success in the 90s, a time when businesses were booming and growing fast and probably more willing to take a chance on utilizing the services of an then-unknown copywriter. <br />The economy has since changed and things are a bit more difficult. I think the &quot;Six Months&quot; in the book's sub-title should now be changed to at least twelve months. But that's not really Bowerman's fault and he is relating his recommendations and ideas based upon his experience, so I'll cut him some slack on the six months claim.<br />And his ideas do work, just not quite as fast as you might hope. To his credit, he doesn't sugarcoat the difficulty of obtaining clients. He admits you'll hear &quot;no&quot; more often than not when you start out, but his methods of self-promotion do seem to work, it just takes more time than one might otherwise believe.<br />I hate cliches, but &quot;The Well Fed Writer&quot; truly is the Bible for freelance writers.

His writing is not necessarily compelling and the reality is this book is probably not going to change anyone's political stances. Human nature is such that it just does not happen very often that a person's politics are going to suddenly turn upon reading a book by a person who they view as being a part of the opposition.<br />Regardless, it is still a fun read, particularly in its expose of Bill O'Reilley, which isn't necessarily all that damning. Of course, O'Reilley became incensed that anyone investigated claims regarding his background and he turned what should have been relatively minor problems into a spin control problem.<br />Heck, O'Reilley's own mother has confirmed that he didn't live in the bad area of town that he tries to claim. Yet O'Reilley is bound and determined to make everyone believe he grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.<br />Apparently conservatives, lacking any dirt on Franken (Franken pretty much has admitted to all of his past without embellishment and even apologized for tricking John Ashcroft), decide to attack this book accusing Franken of not looking at the liars on the left, whining, and God knows what else. <br />Fox News was so incredibly stupid as to sue him, probably fueling more sales of the book. And their attacks demonstrate an underlying point of the book: conservatives and Republicans lost their sense of humor somewhere along the way. Why is it that so many conservative types are pompous blowhards?<br />All politicans and political commentators hate having the microscope turned on them and Franken does so here, to often hilarious results. Look for more attacks by the humorless on Franken in the near future.	2003-09-22

Nontheless, &quot;Fire&quot; is often compelling, sometims educational, and rarely boring.<br />The book is essentially a collection of magazine articles written by Junger, but they demonstrate several things: Junger is truly fascinated by dangerous occupations and dangerous lives, he has a wonderful way with words, and he has a knack for finding interesting stories to tell.<br />My favorite section in the book was on Cypress. I felt like an uneducated idiot because I have been completely oblivious to what is happening there and never realized that Cypress was such a potential flashpoint for war between Turkey and Greece. I also enjoyed his story on Afghanistan's &quot;Lion of the Panjshir&quot;: Ahmad Shah Massoud.<br />Probably the least interesting story was the one on whale hunting, not because I was offended that anyone would still hunt whales (Greenpeace probably hates Junger for this story), but because I really felt no sympathy for the way of life that was dying out. I almost get the feeling Junger had mixed emotions about how to portray thw whale hunter and his protege. Close behind the whale hunter story as being the least interesting are, oddly, the two stories on fire fighting. This may seem strange given the title of the book, but these also were written earlier in his career and you can really observe his growth as a writer by reading the book from beginning to end.<br />Still even what one might consider to be his worst work is leagues ahead of so many other writiers. Its  kind of a disservice to point out that any parts fo the book are weaker than the others simply because it all is so well written.<br />While not nearly as detailed and enthralling as &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; this book demonstrates the wealth of writing talent possessed by Junger. Highly recommended.	2003-09-20

Either Dent wasn't nearly as interesting as I anticpated or there's just of lot of information missing here. It may be no fault of the author's, it may well be that there just wasn't that much to write about. Dent did lead what appears to be an interesting life, he apparently was something of an adventurer, but this book is short of details when it comes to those adventures.<br />And there is absolutely no introspection into what drove this guy, beyond a desire to earn a living. Next to Robert E. Howard, another author who is was somewhat contemporaneous with Dent, Dent is a bore. <br />It's also kind of a misnomer to label him the creator of Doc Savage. The idea was actually that of the publisher, although he certainly gets credit for bringing that idea to life. <br />I wish I could recommend this, but as biographies go, its just not very compelling reading.	2003-09-18

When I did read them, Grisham was at the top of my list and as I gradually lost interest in the genre, Grisham was the last I stopped reading, largely because he is an engaging writer (a fact for which I do not think he gets enough credit).<br />I was pleasently surprised when he produced \\"A Painted House,\\" and, in fact, began to wonder why Grisham even bothered to write legal thrillers, he seems to have a deft hand for turning the commonplace of life into entertaining reading. \\"A Painted House,\\" while not great, was a very good read and remains in my library to this day (despite the fact my two-year-old daughter chose to add her artwork to the inside cover).<br />So when I saw \\"Bleachers\\" I immediately grabbed it and read it. Trolling in the waters of sports stories can be pretty dangerous for even the most seasoned writer (let's just say that originality is not always a highlight of such tales), but Grisham pulls it off.<br />More of a novella than a novel, it tells the tale of Neely Crenshaw, a former star quarterback of the local high school who returns to his hometown on the eve of his former coach's impending death. Naturally, it s a small town high school (are there any other types in tales of former high school heroes returning home?). The small town is Messina, a town with a population of 8,000, but a with football stadium that seats 10,000. The town lives and breathes football, so the approaching death of the football coach is the focus of all who live there.<br />We learn that Crenshaw has learned the hard lesson so many former athletes learn, having had a moment of glory early in life, life may seem pretty worthless in the years that follow. Basically, Crenshaw has learned that fame is fleeting. Crenshaw's potential future in football had ended following a knee injury and he has essentially been rootless ever since his glory days 15 years earlier at Messina.<br />A theme of regret and lost opportunities seems to run throughout the book, but it is not as mauldin as that may sound. Some of the characters are pretty much standard for this type of story, e.g., the former class slut, the disillusioned football player, the sadistic coach who for some reason still inspires love from his players, but Grisham makes most of them work well.<br />The story heads toward a predictable ending, and in other hands, this might have been a pretty pedestrian effort, but Grisham manages to breathe life into most of the characters and the tale and we, the readers, are the ultimate beneficiaries.<br />No, its not great literature, but it is a good, quick, and worthwhile read.	2003-09-16

Faslan is a  Muslim, who is sent on a mission to the King of Saqaliba (and not by choice, he has essentially been forced on the journey). He eventually meets a group of Scandanavians who he considers to be truuly barbaric (guess that's why they call them &quot;barbarians). For Fadlan, his new traveling companions are disgusting and horrific, but the leader of the group, Buliwyf (&quot;Beowulf&quot;), who can communicate in Latin, likes Fadlan and Buliwyf sort of adopts Fadlan, sort of like a puppy dog (probably much to Fadlan's chagrin). <br />Fadlan then finds himself enmeshed in a journey to Scandinavia to save Buliwyf's people from the &quot;monsters of the mist.&quot; Ibn Fadlan travels north with Buliwyf and soon finds himself facing seemingly near invincible enemies who curiously always gather their dead and take them with them after a battle.<br />This was an extremely clever take on the Beowulf legend, subtlely telling a tale that could literally have been the basis for the Beowulf saga had it actually occurred. As with many of Crichton's best works, its engrossing reading, though not necessarily great literature. <br />As the story progresses, the Scandavians characters prove to be far less one-dimensional then they originally appeared and Fadlan gets a lesson in understanding other cultures. The explanation for what the &quot;monsters of the mist&quot; are is also a clever twist and, oddly, a believeable one.<br />Unfortunately, the title of the book (it describes one of the more problematic habits of the monsters of the mist) probably kept more than a few readers away when this was first published, and I'm not even sure it was ever published in hardback as I've searched and never been able to find it in hardback format. The film version actually had a more enticing title: &quot;The Thirteenth Warrior.&quot;<br />Despite the title, this is Crichton in top form and a very engrossing read.	2003-09-16

The book essentially recounts the history of the airlines, but it also very much focuses a magnifying glass on many of the players in this industry. <br />But its more than a textbook history, it provides intimate details on the men who run the airlines and provides a great contrast of the various individuals' management styles. <br />I was enthralled by the history of Texas International and Eastern Airlines, in particular, and the recounting of the fall of Frank Lorenzo, a man so reviled that the mechanics union was willing to kill the airline just to defeat him. <br />While the book has been criticized by some for a perceived focus on airlines based in Texas, the fact of the matter is that even today three of the biggest players in the industry are based in Texas: American, Continental, and Southwest. And since they are three of the current survivors, and still three of the major players, the recounting of their histories is probably even more relevant. <br />The only suggestion I might have is that Petzinger update his book in light of airline history since his book was published.	2003-09-15

Frequently, authors fail to be as successful with their follow-up effort; hence the term &quot;sophomore jinx.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, Greenlaw faces that problem. While her writing style remains engaging and welcoming, there' s just not a lot of substance to this recounting of her time on Isle Au Haut, the &quot;very small island&quot; of the title. Its not really her fault, there are items of interest here, its just the whole thing doesn't prove to be very compelling. The book possibly should have been shorter and it might have worked better.<br />Unlike &quot;The Hungry Ocean,&quot; which had the hook of her being the only known female swordfish boat captain, and offered the danger of sailing the ocean in sometimes dangerous waters, lobstering just seems a little, well, boring. To her credit, she may have realized this and, in reality, lobstering isn't the primary focus of the book. But still, despite more than a few interesting characters populating the island, there's just not a lot of interest going on here.<br />Having said that, I still recommend the book. As noted, she does have an engaging writing style and, as with her previous book, you finish wishing you could go somewhere and sit down for a drink with her.	2003-09-15

I have nothing against grahic novels, I collected comics for a number of years when I was younger and even today will occassionally pick up a comic or graphic novel I've heard of. But this one somehow manages to fall short of its obviously heart-felt attempt to be a great piece of story telling.<br />I became interested in \\"Fax\\" while speaking with a friend who spent a year in Kosovo and witnessed many of the same atrocities shown in \\"Fax.\\" So I finally picked up a copy and read it.<br />My difficulty is not with the story so much as the art. Joe Kubert does have a knack for showing war, but his artwork is very inconsistent, particularly in his drawings of people. Throughout the book I had difficulty distinguishing some of the characters from one another. Kubert has a scratchy art style that just did not necessarily lend itself well to this story.<br />And because of the artistic inconsistencies, it made it difficult to follow the story in places. I'm considering re-reading it and perhaps the second time through, with a bit more familiarity with all that is going on, I'll be able to better appreciate it.<br />Its' clear Kubert poured himself into this book, the problem is his artistic style may not have the best one for relating this story. <br />Still, I do recommend it. It tells a frightening tale of a war that we in America still  seem largely ignorant of, and it also functions as a cautionary tale against the atrocities precipitated by hate and violence.	2003-09-11
US	37015883	RWVH99DS9Z50Z	0425036081	776280377	Conan: The Hour Of The Dragon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Conan and his creator at their best	This book actually began life as a serial in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the 1930s. Robert E. Howard (REH) never actually wrote any Conan novels, all of Conan's tales were written for the magazine marketplace. But this is his only novel length Conan tale so it is considered by many to be the only REH Conan novel.<br />That being said, it is easily one of the best Conan stories written. In the tale, Conan is the king of Aquilonia, but he has plenty of people conspiring to dethrone him. These conspirators raise the wizard, Xaltotun, from the dead to use his magic against Conan.<br />They succeed in dethroning Conan when he is paralyzed by the wizard and unable to ride out into battle. After the battle they believe Conan is dead (big mistake) for a time, only he is actually in hot pursuit of the Heart of Ahriman, the only thing capable of defeating Xaltotun.<br />Naturally, the Heart is not easily obtained and Conan journeys far and wide in his pursuit of it. The story is incredibly fast paced and for a relatively short novel, its packed with action and story. Of course, Conan succeeds at the end and regains his kingdom (as well as gaining a wife).<br />Even though the story is at a mid-point in Conan's career, its an excellent starting point for those who are new to REH's work. As other reviewer's have noted, this story also exists in paperback as &quot;Conan the Conqueror,&quot; although it has been edited to correct grammer and some of REH's politcally incorrect references. Heck, it was the first Conan story I ever read and it got me hooked.<br />REH is a moody, atmospheric writer and much of his work, including this one, carries a sense of darkness to it. Even this book, where Conan ultimately is victorious carries that feeling to it. It tends to almost carry an air of that darkness, a feeling that no matter what Conan does, his victories will be short-lived and even he will not be able to defeat death when his time comes.<br />For sword and sorcery fans, this is asgood as it gets. Ignore the hoard of imitators who followed and stick to the master-- Robert E. Howard.	2003-09-11

As I recall, this was actually the last edition of Lancer's Conan saga, even though it is chronologically number eleven in the series, and it was probably published last with good reason: it's just pretty bad. <br />In fact, it may not have been published in the original line. Its been a number of years since the series came out, but I think Lancer may have ceased publishing the series and this volume did not come out until the series but picked up by subsequent publishers (someone with a fresher memory than mine may be able to clarify that point).<br />As another reviewer noted, it seems to be a series of loosely strung together episodes as Conan engages in one of the oldest and tiredest type of tale in sword and sorcery: rescuing the damsel in distress. Unlike Conan the Avenger (originally entitled &quot;The Return of Conan&quot;), which carried a similar theme, there is no real energy or originality to any of the story. Carter and de Camp have done far better Conan stories. You almost get the sense that everyone just wanted to make sure there were twelve volumes in the series, so this one was thrown together.<br />The only real reason to read this is if you are a Conan completist, otherwise, you won't be missing any significant contributions to the Conan saga if you pass on it.	2003-09-05

Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg to fill in the gaps and complete the saga. For the most part, they comported themselves well. <br />This is the final tale in that series, and for a non-REH story, it's pretty good. Carter and de Camp both had been around Conan enough by the time they produced this that they get the general flavor of what makes Conan, well, Conan. I probably should give it more stars, simply because of all the pure pablum that has been produced by would-be REH imitators over the past 20 years or so, but its still not quite anything more than an above average book.<br />Regardless, its well written and clearly attempting to honor REH's Conan tales. In this book, Conan is in his twilight years and is still looking for one final adventure, or adventures, as the case may be. Clearly, Conan has no intention of dying of old age in a bed surrounded by grandchildren.<br />The early chapters of the book are probably the best as Conan evenutally sets off sailing and finds himself in a new, unknown world (presumably America). Naturally, this being a Conan tale, he soon finds himself enmeshed in adventures in this new world. And, relying on not only muscle but guile, Conan naturally triumphs.<br />Given the fact that I am now in my 40s, this tale may resonate more with me. The fact that a 60-ish Conan is still vital and more than willing to fight kind of inspires me.  The ending actually leaves the door open for further adventures, even though this was to be the final tale in the Conan saga (of course, others decided there was still money to be made off the poor guy, so all kinds of junk is still being written about Conan today). <br />Stick to the Lancer series and its reprints and ignore all that other junk.	2003-09-04

Actually, what I heard was<BR>an extended discussion of the cover, by which a number of people were apparently fascinated. Moreover, everyone who read seemed to rave about it. My curiously led me to pick up a copy<BR>soon after it came out.  <br />While I enjoyed this book, I did not find it to be quite the experience others did. It is a very good book, but, perhaps because it is more of a novella than a novel, I found myself wanting more information. On the other hand, that may speak well for the book, shouldn't a good author always leave you begging for more?<br />The book tells the tale of two young friends who are exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution. There they come in contact with the daughter of the local tailor and discover a hidden cache of Western novels (yes, including works by Balzac) which have been translated into Chinese. Both become enamored with the seamstress as they secretly read the banned works, and find some respite from their status as laborers in both reading and in performing oral movies for villagers. <br />Throughout the tale, we are drawn into the lives of the two friends, although I never really connected with the characters or felt empathy with either of them. I was sympathetic to their situation, but I never really identified with them as I generally do with characters in a novel. But trust me, this is only a minor criticism and, based on other reviews, I am very much in the minority in feeling as I did. Moreover, I guess I was somewhat disappointed that the book did not move me as deeply as I thought it would after hearing about it. Maybe its just a classic case of too much build-up and anticipation prior to reading it; there was no way it could live up to its billing.<br />Whether this book will reach the classic status that so many seem to believe it will, only time will tell. It has fable-like qualities, but somehow I don't see it eventually finding status as a fable. It is an excellent read and do highly recommend it.	2003-09-03

Despite the fact thatAustralia is one of the most dangerous continents on earth (if not the most dangerous), you will still feel the pull to visit and, possibly, become a resident.<br />The book recounts Bryson's assignment to essentially circumnavigate and criss-cross Australia, reporting on its people, its sights, and its culture. At each city or site he visits, he humorously recounts why its well known, who died there and why (for some odd reason, people keep setting out to cross the Outback and are never heard from or seen again), and what he found interesting about it. <br />Bryson points out the many dangers of Australia. Among them, of the ten deadliest snakes in the world, all ten happen to reside in Australia. For whatever reason, Bryson's writing style grabs you and pulls you. Almost like a thriller where you can't wait to get to the end, you'll fight falling asleep as you read late into the night while trying to find out what oddity he is going to encounter next in his travels.<br />Highly entertaining, informative, and recommended.	2003-09-03

This novel is part history lesson, part love story, and part little guy makes good. Samuel Klayman and Josef Kavalier, are Jewish cousins who first meet when Josef moves in with Sam and his mother after escaping from Nazi-occupied Prague. Joe, a magician and escape artist, has managed to be smuggled out of Poland in a most surprising and interesting way. Soon, they are working together in the fledgling comics industry and manage to strike gold when they create the Escapist, a sort of super escape artist.<br />The story leads us through their lives as they ride out the golden age of comics and Josef goes off to war, leaving behind the woman he loves who, unbeknownst to him, is pregnant with his child. The war changes Josef and when he fails to return, Sam presses on, trying to continually make a living in an industry that was almost squeezed out of existence in the 1950s. Sam also must deal with issues of his homosexuality, as he maintains an appearance of a straight, married man, while facing potential scrutiny from McCarthy area politics. <br />Throughout the book, historical figures and events are intertwined in the lives of Sam and Josef so seamlessly that one could easily believe they were actually living, breathing people who existed at that time.  I am a huge fan of novels that successfully interweave historical fact with fictional characters, and Chabon succeeds like few others have in this task.<br />And that is just the tip of the iceberg on this great, often humorous novel that in many ways is Chabon's thank you to the comics of his youth (take a look at some of the individuals he credits for inspiration in this book). <br />On a side note, I have read that The Escapist and, possibly, the character of Josef, are based somewhat on Jim Steranko, a comic book legend who actually was a performing escape artist beforeworking in comics. Steranko was also the inspiration for Jack Kirby?'s (and if you do not know who Kirby is, you probably have never picked up a comic book) Mr. Miracle, a character who came on the comic scene in the seventies and was known as the ?\\"Super Escape Artist.\\"<br />Sure this book is rather lengthy, but every page is entertaining and its well worth the trip to its somewhat bittersweet, but happy, ending. I cannot recommend this book more highly.	2003-09-02

But ultimately it is a collection of Hemingway's commentary and quotes, not a true guide to writing. <br />I think the book would work better had the editor (who is to be complemented for culling all of this information out of Hemingway's work and letters and organizing it) incorporated further advice or commentary from other sources. Perhaps by asking some other author or authors how Hemingway's advice has applied to them, the book would better work as a kind of writer's guide.<br />Regardless, the book is a great source of Hemingway quotes and commentary and I do recommend it. Just don't expect it to turn you into the next Ernest Hemingway.	2003-08-28

Jake struggles with what the wound means to his life and with his love for Brett Ashley, a love that in his mind will have to remain forever unrequited because of his wound.<br />Alcohol is a major player in Jake and his friends' lives, and throughout the book he attempts to cover over the pain he is in with alcohol and traveling with his friends. Hemingway, without even informing the reader of the exact nature of the wound (I doubt he would have been able to be published had he described the exact nature of the wound), conveys both the true nature of the wound and the emotional pain that comes with it for Jake.<br />The novel is somewhat auto-biographical in that Hemingway suffered wounds to his legs in WWI and that most of the characters were based on actual people he knew. At the time of the book's release, there was some concern that he might be sued for libel, but nothing ever came of it. In fact, several of the real individuals upon whom the characters were based bragged for many years that they were basis for the characters.<br />A little trivia related to the book: Hemingway's parents were repulsed by the novel and made Ernest aware of it. This caused some turmoil in family relations and Ernest's pride was obviously wounded by their disgust with the book. <br />Years later, when Hemingway was hospitalized after a plane crash, a reporter kept insisting that Hemingway's story was more auto-biographical than originally thought. The reporter kept insisting that he believed Hemingway suffered the same wound as Jake (despite the fact that Hemingway had fathered several children by then). Tired of arguing with thereporter, Hemingway finally pulled back the sheets to show the reporter that he suffered no such wound.	2003-08-22

There's something about a story that successfully weaves fictional characters into the factual past in such a way that you cannot tell where fiction begins and ends.<br />This book is such a novel. Filled with a number of subplots (e.g., the creation of television, the sudden death of President Warren G. Harding, the mysterious figure stalking Carter) while relating the story of Carter's life, it's a wild, interesting ride that draws you in and literally leaves you wishing for more when it finally concludes.<br />As a mystery, its not perfect, but Gold manages to make most of the pieces fit together without straining credibility. And the fact that Carter was a real person makes the story all the more interesting as, from what little I have gleaned about him after reading the novel, the fictional parts of the story could literally have been a part of his life.<br />Highly recommended, particularly if you're heading for a beach and want entertaining reading while you soak up the sun.	2003-08-22

Although I do not have sons, I thought I could pass it along to my brother, who does have a son, and that I might glean some helpful information in raising my two daughters.<br />First, several other reviewers have criticized the book for its \\"Christian\\" perspective, one even acts surprised that it is a Christian focused book. Frankly, it does not take much of a perusal to see that it is written from a Christian perspective, and one that is of a more conservative nature. That, plus the fact that it is no secret the primary author is a minister, should have tipped off those who are troubled by its Christian overtones. And the authors certainly were not hiding the fact that their faith is a big part of their writing this book.  I have to wonder if those who are highly critical of the book were truly surprised and put off by this aspect of the book, or if they just wanted to take some shots at the religious beliefs of the authors.<br />As to the book itself, I am a more moderate Christian (some friends might say liberal) so I did not find it to be quite the life-changing revelation some others have. Its general tone is overly conservative but I think the actual idea behind the book, i.e., raising a son to fulfill the mythic traditions of honor, duty, and such that is tied to knighthood, is excellent. And, you know, had my father done some of the things that are suggested in the book, I would have been excited and very much into it both as a child and teenager.<br />If I am critical of anything in the book, it is that I think the ideas need fleshing out, a little more detail or alternatives, e.g., what can you do if you can't afford to by your son a ring with a special crest. And, perhaps in response to any \\"legitimate\\" complaints about its Christian perspective, the authors might consider addressing its use by non-Christians in some future edition.<br />However, it is a very good guide to laying a foundation for raising a boy into a man, and I think the underlying theme that kind of gets lost in the arguments about its Christian perspective (involvement of a father in his son's life), is something both Christians and non-Christians should heed. I have passed the book along to my brother, although I don't know if he has read it yet, and I am trying to adapt some of the ideas to raising my daughters.<br />All in all, whether you are Christian or not, this book provides some original and sound ideas for raising a son. And while I only give it three stars (I wish Amazon would add a half-star to each ranking level), it is a book I recommend.to laying a foundation for raising a boy into a man, and I think the underlying theme that kind of gets lost in the arguments about its Christian perspective (involvement of a father in his son's life), is something both Christians and non-Christians should heed.

This book falls somewhere in between; I<BR>would like to give it three-a-half stars, but that's not one of the choices, so I'll go with four stars.<br />This book was my introduction to Hemingway several years ago. I had never read any of his works, and while on vacation I ate at the Hemingway's Restaurant in Sarasota, Florida. The food<BR>was pretty mediocre, but the Hemingway memorabilia and a conversation with our waitress made me curious, so I picked up a copy of this book.<br />As biographies go, it is very well researched and for the most part, fairly detailed. However, I found the latter part of it almost rushed and rather sketchy on details of Hemingway's last few<BR>years. That was an initial criticism I had of the book, but as I later found in reading other biographies, that seems to be a problem with many of Hemingway's biographies. I've come to the conclusion that there just really is not a lot of information about him during his last few years. <br />So, I have dropped an early criticism I had of the book, however, it does suffer from some tediously boring passages that almost make you want to skip ahead. I do not know if we can<BR>actually blame the author for that or if its just a fact that in relating Hemingway's life history not everything was necessarily interesting or exciting.<br />I also would like more details on his divorces. Hemingway was married four times, divorced three times, and I am curious as to what effect this had on his family, particularly on his children<BR>who came from two of the marriages. Had did the breakup of his first marriage affect the relationship of Hadley (his first wife) and Pauline (his second wife), who were friends? There<BR>also is little discussion of Hemingway's involvement with rasing his children. Sure he hunted and fished with them, but what other rolesdid he fulfill with his children? Was he essentially an absentee father? I guess there will always be some unanswered questions in an examination of anyone's life.<br />Still, compared to two other biographies I have read, this is the best and most complete so I do recommend it. If you want the \\"true gen\\" on Hemingway, this is the most complete source I am aware of.	2003-08-21

At that age I probably had no business reading it, but I made my first purchase ever of a book when I bought it. Amazingly, even though that was over thirty-five years ago, I still own the book.<br />The book is fast-paced, action packed, and carries the eerie atmopshere that so many Howard stories do (what is it about authors who shoot themselves that seems to tie them so closely to great story-telling?). Conna faces insurmountable odds in losing his kingdom, and naturally, he eventually overcomes them. The fun of the tale is in following his adventures as he travels the world to find the means to defeat his enemies.<br />Obviously, Howard isn't everyone's cup of tea. There is an air of fatality and finality looming over all of his best works, including this one. Despite Conan's ultimate victory, you almost sense that Howard knew, and by extension Conan knew, that all victories are short lived and would soon pass.<br />Regardless, if you have an interest in sword and sorcery, this is must reading and probably a good starting point for people new to the genre. Howard is essentially the father of the genre and is still the best in that area in my opinion.<br />Just looking at a lot of the deriviative junk that has grown around the whole Conan mythos, you really have to wish that Howard had lived longer and continued to write more about Conan, although at the time of his death, Howard was moving away from the genre to what he considered better paying markets.<br />I give it five stars because it is in many ways the peak of Howard's writing. And thirty-five years later, I still occassionally pick it up and re-read it, which may say a lot about how well-written it is, since I long ago left fantasy reading behind me.	2003-08-21

There are references to Ernest<BR>reviewing Leicester's attempts at writing, but nothing to indicate if Leicester ever published<BR>anything beyond this book. This may be because the book is focused on Ernest, rather than<BR>Leicester, but it would be nice to know what successes Leicester may or may not have had.<br />None of the above should dissuade the Hemingway fan from reading the book.

I devoured this book and wanted more.  Its rare that I read any books that potentially fall into the self-help realm. All too often they give you a feel-good experience that manages to disappear soon after you finish the book. Not so with &quot;Wild at Heart.&quot;<br />John Eldredge really touches a nerve, actually all your nerves and your heart, with his insights into manhood. As you read you will find yourself nodding in agreement and often smiling as you find that all men struggle with remarkably similar issues and thst its okay to have &quot;wildness&quot; in your heart. Mr. Eldredge succinctly examines the emasculation of the modern American man (be he Christian or otherwise), and validates many of the feelings men have today of being isolated and powerless. Its rare that I read a book and feel empowered afterward, but on completing this book I felt I was better prepared to face each day's challenges and felt I was a better husband, father, and man for having read it.<br />The book is well organzied and easily accessible; its not a how-to so much as a &quot;trust your hear and instincts&quot; book. Making it even more enjoyable are frequent references to many modern-day films that make it resonate all the more with you as you read. <br />Whether you are a Christian or not, if you are a man, you need to read this book. I have been buying additional copies and giving them to friends and family. I guess that is probably the highest comliment I can give this author and his work.	2002-03-20

However, I started reading it before she did and I quickly was drawn into Alexandra Fuller's world.<br />Her style is a little disconcerting at first (simply because she is speaking in her own voice and the language and slang  she grew up with), and it takes a while to fall into the flow of her jumping around in her life in the early chapters, but I almost immediately was drawn into her world.  <br />I really enjoy writers who have a style all their own and Fuller definitely has her own unique voice. Her language is sometimes choppy, but it stills conveys meaning and understanding. <br />What I partuclarly liked was the subtle way she conveyed the changing of the guard in Africa, as black rule began to become the rule, rather than the exception. Without directly commenting on the changes either positively or negatively, she conveys the confusion that the change brought about and suggests that whether blacks or whites are in control, the common people of most African nations remain oppressed by their leaders.I think Ms. Fuller makes it clear that regardless of their race, whites and blacks are Africans and that something must eventually be done about the oppresive political environment present in so many African nations. This book is particulary relevant given the recent turmoil over the apparent re-election of Robert Mugabe. <br />I was fascinated by her mother, but wished she had provided more information about her sister. At one point she hints that her sister may have been molested by a neighbor and that a neighbor may have attempted to do the same to her, but she is vague on details, perhaps deliberately so. <br />I also was a little disappointed that there was not more detail on her and her sister's lives in their late teens and early adulthood, but she still manages to convey a tremendous amount of information about their lives as young adults in a relatively short span. <br />Overall this is a fascinating look at a way of life that is rapidly dying out and I would be curious to see if her parents are eventually forced to leave Africa. I guess its a mark of a good author that when they finish their tale, you're asking for more.	2002-03-13
