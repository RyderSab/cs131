The premise of a funeral director who was in to investigating crimes sounded quirky enough to be interesting and the title suggested a sense of humour that I might appreciate. As it turns out this is quite a funny book, largely due to the characters and their interrelationships.  Not being from Baltimore (which is the setting for the book) there may well have been other jokes that I missed, although I knew what was being said in some of the very snide references to Maine. Certainly, Tim Cockey has a wry sense of humour and makes good use of it in Hitchcock Sewell.<br />The murder mystery at the centre of the plot is also quite engaging and complex and managed to keep its secrets till the end. However the denouement itself felt a bit rushed and almost a means of resolving a relationship between two of the characters. Having said that, this book was lots of fun and easy to read (I knocked it off in two days with very little actual reading time). I am more than likely to read the other books featuring Hitchcock Sewell. It wouldn't surprise me to see a film script being made from this one.	2002-09-15

This book has gone the closest of any that I have read to proving the theory wrong. Charles Arrowby was, for me, thoroughly unlikeable. A retired actor and director who has manipulated his way through a string of relationships throughout his life on the premise that his one true love had abandoned him while he was still young. The arrogant certainty that others would find happiness should they only bend their wills to his, leads him to abuse virtually every other character he comes across. He refuses to acknowledge that his long lost love could possibly be happy apart from him and resorts to kidnapping and imprisoning her to `bring her to her senses'. Only the deaths of two other characters seems to threaten his self assurance.<br />Yet Iris Murdoch was a brilliant writer. She captures both scenery and characters beautifully. Despite my distaste for Charles Arrowby I was compelled to read to find out what horrific thing he would do or say next. Some will find it too wordy no doubt, but this novel was well worthy of the accolades accorded it when it was written.	2002-09-15

However, the publicity that this book received and the fact that I have been to theological college myself made me decide to give it a shot. James has obviously researched her material well. Questions of theology are handled relatively astutely. While she writes in a note at the beginning that the characters are not based on anyone, she obviously has a good knowledge of human character and applies this in an interesting way to those in her book. Having said that, it is a bit sad that she feels the need to say that she doesn't want to discourage candidates for ministry training or visitors to theological colleges. If such people really cannot tell the difference between real life and detective fiction then something seems wrong with our world.<br />It was only relatively late in the story that I figured out who the murderer would be, which is a sign that the writer has not made things so obvious that the book is not worth reading (although it could just have been my unfamiliarity with this genre). At the same time, once the murderer was revealed there were clues that one could look back on, so it didn't feel that James has just picked an unlikely candidate in order to keep it a mystery. This was a fun read but not, ultimately, one that would make me want to read many similar books. For it's explorations of character and the exploration of an unusual setting I would recommend it as something worth reading.	2002-05-10

Farrell's Booker Prizewinning novel is based on events in what has been called by the British the `Sepoy' or `Indian Mutiny' and by Indians the `National Uprising' or the `First War of Independence' of 1857. In particular, as the title suggests, it deals with a siege in a small town called Krishnapur from the point of view of the besieged British colonials. While the reader feels an extraordinary amount of sympathy for the suffering that they obviously undergo, it is tempered somewhat by the attitudes that Farrell critiques, even among the more enlightened (from a modern perspective) characters.<br />Whether it be the topics of theology, science and pseudo-science, relationships between the sexes, colonialism, or the way that we respond to extreme circumstances, all are handled intelligently. To my delight Farrell didn't try to give characters modern attitudes or feelings (the bane of much historical fiction) in order to make them more `appealing' to the reader. Instead, what is most fascinating about the story is to think about how the individual reacts to change, and especially change arising from terrible events. The changes that particular characters undergo are simultaneously humorous and absolutely believable. This is an excellent read if you already have an interest in India, or in the impact that westerners have had upon other cultures. If you haven't when you begin, you may well find that you have before you finish.	2002-05-10

In brief, it is written as the journal of Edmund Talbot, composed for his godfather and patron, an English lord, during a journey from England to Australia sometime during the early 19th century. In particular, it deals with the events before, and the investigation subsequent to, the death of a parson who is also on board.<br />Because of the setting, characters of diverse backgrounds are thrown into closer contact than they might otherwise have had. This means that notions of class and how it impacts upon individuals play an important part in the novel. Questions of faith and the effect that it has upon actions are also crucial. Ultimately this is a very human story (much as is Golding's most famous book `Lord Of The Flies') as it deals with the way that people react when put into extreme (and not so extreme) circumstances.<br />This is certainly a book worth reading on its own terms. However, it has also whet my appetite to find and read the other two books, `Close Quarters' and \\"Fire Down Below'.	2002-05-07
US	51672239	RIC0HTI8HAJMK	0811213668	256202992	The Emigrants	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Important novel, beautifully written	In it's thematic linkage of a number of stories, where the connecting theme is the dislocation of being in a foreign land, this book is very reminiscent of V.S. Naipaul's 'In A Free State'. However, that the emigrants in this novel are German Jews gives it a particular poignancy. While avoiding a voyeuristic focus on the violence and oppression that led to their leaving, references to Kristallnacht and the visit of the narrator to the cemetery in Kissingen leave the reader with a profound sense of loss. I want to think more about the sense of decay that pervades Sebald's descriptions of countrysides in Europe. I also wondered about the one linking character 'The Butterfly Man' (although obviously a different person in each story) and whether he is more that a simple literary conceit (I suspect the answer is 'Yes'). All in all, this is a beautifully written novel and, in a world where refugees from terror and oppression continue to try and make their lives in new countries, one whose message needs to be heard by both goverments and individuals.	2002-04-25

Having just finished reading this trilogy in one volume I would find it hard to read any of the books individually. Barker really builds on characterisation and plot as each of the stories progresses. Set in Scotland during World War 1 at Craiglockhart (an institution for miltary personnel suffering from shellshock) in `Regeneration', and moving first to England (`The Eye In The Door') and then to the front in France ('The Ghost Road') this is an excellent look at the impact of that war upon the individual. The series is based on historical meetings between W.H. Rivers (anthropologist, psychologist and childhood acquaintance of Lewis Carroll), Siegfried Sassoon (British poet) and Wilfred Owen (poet, killed shortly before the end of the war in 1918) and comes complete with historical notes at the end of each volume and further recommended reading about the people involved.<br />Barker is a fascinating writer with an obvious interest in the way that the human mind works, and particularly how it reacts to trauma. Some of the descriptions of the breakdowns that individuals suffer, and the incidents that cause them, are horrific and make this (at least in my mind) anti-war literature. Having said that, each of the major characters, both real and fictional, possess a longing to be part of the war even though some have already experienced the horror of being there. I was constantly trying to reassess my own viewpoints in the light of such responses.<br />The only real disappointment I felt concerned some of the more graphic descriptions of sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) which illustrated characters responses to events, but occasionally struck me as gratuitous in their detail. Having said that, if you are interested in reading `The Ghost Road' because of it's status as a Booker Prize winner, then I definitely recommend reading it in this format, with the other books in the series.	2001-11-17

In particular, this book is strongest when it analyses the impact that changes in society were having upon the Church. The basic format is for each chapter to focus on one particular country for one section of the period.<br />One of my criticisms of the book is that 5 of the 15 chapters (plus an introduction and an epilogue) focus on England and 2 focus on France. Of the 8 remaining chapters; Germany, Scotland, Russia (and the Eastern churches) and the New World rate a chapter each, while the other 4 look at the impact of specific cultural changes. It does come across as being very Anglo-centric.<br />Another negative about the book is that the writing style can be a little pedestrian at times. Yes, this is history, but there are plenty of history books around that make it clear that you can write history (and remain accurate and factual) while still being a page-turner.<br />While this sounds quite critical, I did enjoy reading the book. The period (between the enormous changes of both the Reformation and the French Revolution) is a fascinating one and there is much in this book that has prompted me to want to read more. Cragg's footnotes and bibliography point in some good directions for doing so. In reality, if there were half stars I would rate this one 3 1/2, but my criticisms mean that I have to lean toward the 3.	2001-11-17

Indeed, my High School mathematics teachers would probably be a bit surprised to find me reading a novel about mathematics. However, that this novel deals with some of the history of Number Theory in mathematics is just part of what is going on.<br />'Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture' deals with notions of talent, obsession, failure, and choice. The narrative concerns a man with incredible talent in mathematics who becomes obsessed with finding the solution to one of mathematics great problems. His failure (at least in any recognisable way) to find the solution leads many, especially his family, to question the choices that he made. However, one of his nephews (the narrator) finds his uncle fascinating and learns many things which force him to re-evaluate both his family's opinion of Uncle Petros, and his own choices in life.<br />In some ways this novel reminded me of 'Sophie's World' by Jostein Gaarder. Where Gaarder's book dealt with the history of philosophy, this one uses the history of Number Theory as it's backdrop. However, if anything the narrative framework for this novel was tighter and more convincing (although the novel itself is relatively short). While I didn't always understand the mathematics of what was going on, that didn't matter for the plot and it has raised some ideas that I will try and read more about in the future. A novel that makes you think about aspects of life AND teaches you some basics about mathematics, I'm glad that I read it.	2001-08-13
US	51672239	R1IIX13KHZOJB9	0375410538	924994086	Anil's Ghost	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Scary, challenging, dense	The Civil War in Sri Lanka is not one that has impinged much on Western consciousness, so a novel dealing with that issue by a writer like Ondaatje is worth checking out for the topic alone. Of course, while the plot deals with a Sri Lankan born forensic anthropologist returning to her homeland to investigate human rights abuses on behalf of an international human rights group, there is much more to this novel than that. Issues such as; the impact of family relationships upon its individual members, the desire of people both to hide and unlock the past, and the way in which love (in various forms) can influence our actions, are all important to the novel.<br />Two other issues stood out for me. Near the end of the novel we read, 'It's probably the history of the last two hundred years of Western political writing. Go home. Write a book. Hit the circuit.' Were the emphasis is on the westerner leaving the place they are writing about, as if the issue is thus ended. I can think of a number of books and films that fit the pattern, thus the critique is quite telling. We can be quite xenophobic, Ondaatje's comments are interesting in relation to the fact that he too is writing a novel on events in another place.<br />Secondly, the novel deals with issues of truth. While one of the central characters initially says, 'Most of the time in our world, truth is just opinion' it is later said of him, 'he would have given his life for the truth if the truth were of any use'. It is encouraging to see a writer, describing a world where misinformation and covering up truth are a fact of life, acknowledging that there is a place for recognising it's existence.<br />This is a very dense and intense novel and obviously not for everyone. No doubt much more could and, hopefully, will be said on this topic. However, &quot;Anil's Ghost&quot; is an excellent starting point.	2001-08-03

Their ongoing relationship and the events taking place in the child psychologists life form the basis for this novel. What is fascinating about it is the thought processes we hear running through Tom's head as he questions his own previous judgement, not just with Danny but also with Lauren (Tom's wife). Barker has very cleverly not tried to put us inside Danny's head (an altogether difficult exercise, surely?) but allowed us to experience Tom's confusion over the limited information that Danny allows himself to reveal. I was in doubt about how things would end right up to the final page. The author doesn't try to answer all the questions (which obviously proves frustrating for some reviewers), keeping the novel at a managable length, but raises enough to keep me thinking about the issues for a long time. Once I started reading I could hardly put it down.	2001-07-26

This belongs to the latter group with its focus being on love, relationships and commitment. What plot there is involves a newly married Spanish translator and interpreter attempting to come to terms with what marriage means, while the mystery of why his father's second wife committed suicide (an event which opens the novel) is gradually revealed. If you don't mind the extended discourses on particular topics or enjoy thinking about the way relationships do and don't work then this novel could be for you. If you are looking for something with lots of movement and excitement you may be better off elsewhere. Even though paragraphs sometimes went for pages, I found it fascinating and even took down page numbers along the way of ideas I wanted to come back to. While I now know the mystery, I want to go back and think again about how it is that it is revealed. This very `literary' novel is well crafted.	2001-05-20

Unfortunately, I just couldn't seem to get into it. This might have been because of my own inability to empathise with Christopher, the central character. Having said that, as you would expect from Ishiguro, the book is beautifully written. The attitudes and expressions of characters come across as historically accurate (contrary to the current trend where historical characters always seem to possess 21st century values). Suspense is maintained throughout as Ishiguro cleverly keeps us from knowing any more than the narrator about what has happened to his parents. There were also interesting parallels in the latter half of the novel to Conrad's `Heart Of Darkness' as the search moves through the war-torn area of Shanghai and Christopher not only has to search physically but also grows in self-awareness. While it didn't grab me at first reading I'm not really surprised that others love it. I'm prepared to give it a second chance at a later date and may well change my rating.	2001-04-30

Surely the best test of a good travel book is that it makes you want to go the same places, while still describing them in a way that makes you feel like you have already been there. Even though it is now 20 years since Seth made the journey that he records here (and much would have changed) reading this book still made me want to make the same journey, even with all the hardship that it entailed. Another aspect that makes this book exceptional is that the commentary doesn't just focus on descriptions of the trip but wanders off into discussions of political and social issues prompted by the surroundings. One telling comment (especially for westerners) occurs on the last page when he writes of India and China, &quot;the fact that they are both part of the same landmass means next to nothing. There is no such thing as an Asian ethos or mode of thinking&quot;. My only disappointment with this book (and the reason that it only gets 4 stars) is that, while Seth regularly describes taking photographs of various sights, none of them are included in the book. Seth's descriptions are amazing, but some of the visuals would have been even better. If you are interested at all in travel in China and Tibet read this book (and then Paul Theroux's `Riding the Iron Rooster' for a very different viewpoint).	2001-03-18

In the process there are a couple of things that get overstated (while it may be true that there are many dangerous things here, Bryson's focus on them borders on paranoia) but on the whole this book is remarkably insightful into aspects of Australian culture. I found myself reading, laughing, and thinking &quot;Why haven't I thought of it in that way?&quot; He pulls out the quirks and the historical oddities so humorously that I almost didn't notice how much research must have gone into preparing the book. Perhaps the best thing is, there is so much more that he could write! Given the obvious love that he has for the country, maybe Bryson will be back to visit again (perhaps in winter, perhaps going to some other places) and write a sequel. If he does I will certainly be reading it.	2000-11-13

Jarman's writing is clear, powerful and spiritual. He is not afraid to ask questions (nor to attempt to provide an answer and admit that it is inadequate).

Guilt, frustrated passion, familial relationships (especially between twins), jealousy and a myriad of other emotions all built up during the course of the novel. The cause, the death of Sophie Mol, happens so simply and yet it's consequences are so catastrophic. This is a novel that is both beautiful and depressing at the same time.

Given the fairly obvious allusions to Communist Russia it is no surprise that the novel was suppressed for so long. The representation of people by numbers (the central character is D-503), and the conditioning of people to accept the denial of their individuality, are still things which raise alarms in various parts of the world today. The novel is complex in that there are some aspects of this society of which Zamyatin seems to approve. Our initial impressions would normally be that his presentation is focussed upon negatives. In this translation the novel is not too difficult to read. It is a good challenge to all of us to think about how our own societies (and the parts of them that we have some influence upon ie: our families etc.) are ordered.	2000-11-08

What's so difficult about the love of God? Carson makes it clear that it is partly the way that `love' is expressed in modern society (where it has been devalued to the extent that it is either completely romanticised or becomes simply a synonym for sex). On the other hand, when we talk about the `love of God' we sometimes get caught using too narrow a definition (love seen as exclusively for the elect), or too broad (love for the world being so over-emphasised that there is no room left for judgement). Carson shows that God's love, as we should expect, is more complex than that. It is consequently more important and more wonderful. This is a great book because it deals with an important topic, in sufficient depth not to be simplistic, but not in such great detail that it becomes impossible to read. Well worth buying and reading (more than once).	2000-10-11

Having just returned from a trip to New Zealand (which took place in the middle of my reading the novel) I appreciated the impact of Hulme's settings upon the emotions and  actions of its characters in a way which I might not otherwise have done.  Perhaps this is why a New Zealand chain of booksellers had `The Bone  People' at No.5 in its Top 100 books of the 20th Century. The writing style  is idiosyncratic, but gets easier to follow with time. However, the most  confronting thing about this novel is its topic. It deals with domestic  violence against children, and does so in a direct and challenging way.  Perhaps as a consequence, it was only the child (Simon, Haimona, Clare)  that I felt any real sympathy towards, and it was the sections which  featured his narrative voice which were the most engaging. I don't know  whether it is possible to say I enjoyed reading a novel with this theme.  Perhaps the major letdown was the happy ending, which felt forced. While  the desire of the characters to be together fitted with my limited  knowledge of domestic violence, the implication that everything would work  out almost belittled the brutal realism that we had seen earlier. I hope,  as others have suggested, that the ending might have been some sort of  dream.	2000-07-24

She had a marvellous gift for conveying character and setting with the minimum of fuss. Consequently, her novels are quite short and easy to read. `The Gate  of Angels' gives us England at the beginning of the 20th Century. The  advances of Rutherford and Mach (among others) were being disseminated.  Scientific rationalism was to the fore. This is chiefly represented in  Fitzgerald's central character, Fred Fairly, a junior fellow at a Cambridge  College. However, his chance meeting with Daisy Saunders begins to  challenge his view. While Fitzgerald never explicitly says so, the  implication is clear: even in a world where science is thought to explain  everything, there are some aspects of that world which will not bow. Some  may find the lack of resolution frustrating. However, enough has been said  to reasonably leave any further consequences to the readers' imagination.	2000-07-24

I can't say that I had ever thought about the life of a professional classical musician and what it must involve (intense relationships with other performers, struggles with money etc.) but this book made me feel  that I was part of that world. More importantly, the passions of Michael  (the central character) for music, for his violin, and for the woman he  foolishly abandoned and who has married someone else, are communicated so  vividly that I feel I might recognise him if he were real and we passed in  the street. This is a marvellous novel. I want to listen to all the pieces  of music that feature prominently. I want to read it again and marvel at  Seth's characterisation, making some unusual and, almost tragically, flawed  people seem so normal. This is easily the best new book I have read this  year.	2000-07-14

Particularly since it won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 1999, this novel seems to have polarised reviewers. Some have been caustic about it's supposed deficiencies, while others have heaped praise upon this  debut novel of Andrew Miller. Certainly it is an ingenious idea for a  story. A boy, the consequence of an illicit liason, grows having no  feelings (of pain, but also it seems of emotions). After an eventful  childhood he becomes a renowned surgeon as an adult, only to discover pain  in a disappointment and subsequently to be admitted to an asylum. The  events of his incarceration and subsequent release lead him to a quiet life  in the country and his subsequent death, which was also the starting point  for the novel. Some things disappointed me. At times the novel felt  disjointed as various devices, such as letters and different narrative  voices, seemed to intrude rather than to help. I also felt the reader was  left hanging somewhat over both how James Dyer was born to not feel pain,  and then how this sense of feeling was recovered. On the whole, though,  after some difficulty in starting the novel I finished it very quickly and  found it an entertaining read. Perhaps the secret is to not have too high  an expectation, and then see how Miller's writing style sits with you. Do  read it though.	2000-06-14

Annie Proulx's work. Te idea behind this book, tracing the history of an accordion through the lives of its owners was a really interesting one and,  in particular, seemed to allow Ms. Proulx to comment on the immigrant  experience in America. Particularly telling is a passage not far from the  end when, after we have seen much prejudice against all sorts of cultural  groups during the novel, we read &quot;it's not the same as when our  grandparents come over; they were white, they had guts, a good work  ethic&quot;. Unfortunately, it seems people will always find reasons to  justify prejudice against another group.<br />While the depictions of the  lives of the people in this novel are quite vividly drawn, and often  incredibly depressing as they try to adjust to the culture and  circumstances around them, it does drag occasionally. Indeed, there are  times when the accordion itself seems to go missing, which is frustrating.  However, waiting for the revelation to occur which concludes the book kept  me interested. I am glad I finished because, while it is a hard read, the  ideas and the lives of the characters challenged me to think about my own  life and attitudes. It will take some time, but ultimately it is worth the  effort.	2000-05-22

What did  I like about it? Well, the concept of a king who was actually trained to be  an assassin (rather than one who took on the role to get there) was a good  start. A kingdom called Djelibeybi (you have to say it aloud) that  remarkably resembles Egypt, but skewed in the way that only Pratchett's  Discworld series can, was also clever. Add to that swipes at pyramidology,  the way some of religions followers abuse the power they get from it, and a  teenage hero concerned about all the normal things that teenagers are  concerned about, and you get a funny book. Perhaps my favourite bit is that  camels are the smartest creatures on the disc (maybe you have to have met  some camels to really understand that). If you are a fan of Terry  Pratchett, there is a fair chance you will like this book. If you've never  read him before, buy `Pyramids' and prepare to laugh.	2000-05-02

It is largely a collection of the Old Testament law and difficult for modern readers to come to terms with. This  commentary will make a huge difference. I now look forward to working on  this particular Old Testament book. Wenham takes the material and shows  clearly how it fits together. He also demonstrates the links between it and  the New Testament. While the commentary contains some technical language,  even the non theologically trained will find it helpful for understanding  Leviticus. For preachers, or those leading Bible Studies, thinking about  looking at Leviticus this commentary is a must.	2000-05-02

It saddens me that `Of Mice and Men' was the second most frequently banned book in the American public school curriculum of the 1990's. While people have objected to the language, it reflects the times and the circumstances  of the characters (and is better than most of what we might hear in our  modern world). While the ending is horrific, the motivation behind George's  action continues the theme of brotherly love and respect that has been  present throughout the novel. This is a short but challenging read and  prompts questions about relationships, dreams, and our attitude to life and  the taking of it. `Of Mice and Men' confirms Steinbeck's reputation as a  great writer and in no way should this novel be banned.	2000-05-02

Books	4	43	46	N	N	A damning critique of some media darlings	At the beginning of the 1990's a media bandwagon around `new' outlooks on the life of Jesus was in full swing. In particular the works of Bishop John Spong (USA), A.N Wilson (UK) and Barbara Thiering (Australia) were given  popular acclaim. Wright (a well credentialled New Testament scholar) takes  each of these `writers' and shows how flawed their accounts are. He is  strong, concise and rightly critical of poor scholarship. While the times  that occasioned the book may have passed, the issues remain and Wright's  discussion of what we can say about Jesus is very helpful.	2000-04-30

While the subject matter, the intrigues surrounding clerical life in a fictional English cathedral town, might put you off, don't let it. Trollope wrote  fantastic characters. While it's sequel, Barchester Towers, is even better,  this is an excellent short introduction both to the series and to  Trollope's writing as a whole. (Incidentally, the BBC TV series `Barchester  Chronicles' is a really good adaptation of both `The Warden' and  `Barchester Towers'.)	2000-04-30

One of the interesting aspects of writing a thesis on imagery in Hardy's novels was getting to read some of the lesser known of his writings, this one included. While there is good reason for many of them to be little considered, &quot;A Laodicean&quot; is still worth a read if you are a  Hardy fan. It was largely written while he was bedridden after a mystery  illness in 1880-1881. In the novel. Hardy tries to capture the changing  world in the England of his day. Aristocracy and family names had  dominated, but new wealth in the form of industry and technology were  beginning to assert themselves. Thus, his heroine Paula Powers can't make  up her mind which of her two suitors, an aristocrat and an architect, she  really wants. Even when she makes her choice, there is still doubt in her  mind right to the end of the novel, hence the description of her as a  `Laodicean', (from Revelation 3:14-22) someone who is neither hot nor cold.  Many of the images and themes which we associate with Hardy's better known  novels are here, but it never quite hits the heights. Still, it is  interesting to see this take on the changes on England's society near the  end of the 19th century.	2000-04-24
US	51672239	R3TIS6AI0RHYZR	0670883514	190240218	Jessica	Books	3	9	13	N	N	Historical fiction with a modern slant	A student recommended this book and loaned me their copy. Although it is quite long, it is a very easy read. Gives a picture of life in the Australian outback around the beginning of the 20th century, focussing on  what professes to be the true story of a particular woman, the Jessica of  the title. Her story is a tragic one and Courtenay captures that well.  However, a problem here, as with much historical fiction, is that of giving  historical characters particularly modern points of view. Although all of  the prevailing influences in her life are racist, sexist etc. Jessica turns  out to have a very modern, tolerance-focussed point of view. While this is  excellent, it just doesn't ring true. Admittedly, modern readers might have  trouble sympathising with a central character whose opinions were  historically accurate. However, if we are going to be reading what is  supposed to be a `true story' surely it is what we should expect. Provided  you can get past this sticking point, not a bad read.	2000-04-20

Hengel's work surveys material on crucifixion from all  parts of the ancient world. In doing so he reveals that for the people of  the ancient world, Greeks, Romans, barbarians and Jews, crucifixion was not  something you treated lightly or glossed over. It was absolutely obscene  and wasn't referred to in polite company. That Christians could claim that  the Son of God was crucified would have been not just outrageous, but  offensive. While parts of this book are quite technical (especially in  Hengel's use of ancient languages) it is helpful in restoring our sense of  just what an astonishing thing God has done through Christ. In a world  where the symbol of a cross has become quite commonplace, and even  something we might wear as jewellery, this book helps to change your  perspective.	2000-04-20

Indeed, the idea of a `Damascus road experience' has become part of the English language. However, it has also been the source of much scholarly debate and  critique from an historical, sociological or psychological perspective  (witness Krister Stendahl's 1963 essay `The Apostle Paul and the  Introspective Conscience of the West'). This book is designed to examine  the biblical material and ascertain the impact his experience might have  had on Paul's understanding of Christology, Eschatology, his Gentile  Mission, Justification, Reconciliation, Covenant Theology, the Mosaic Law,  the Holy Spirit, Women and Ethics. On the whole the authors do a good job  (although I cannot agree with Donaldson's views of Paul's Gentile Mission,  which work so hard to avoid the idea that Paul was given the mission by  Christ at conversion that he misses the mark altogether). The material is  well thought through and, despite some of the technical sounding titles,  the language is clear and understandable. Seyoon Kim on Reconciliation and  Gordon Fee on the Holy Spirit were particularly thought provoking. This  book is well worth a read by pastors, theological students or educated lay  people who want to think about the impact that the scriptural record of  Paul's conversion has had upon their understanding of the Christian faith.	2000-04-03
US	51672239	R3NI1GON0JGBNB	1573226882	326942117	Fever Pitch	Books	5	9	10	N	N	I love this book	When I received `Fever Pitch' a couple of years ago I thought, &quot;How nice. A book about English soccer (of which I am a fan).&quot; While this is partly true, there is so much more to this book than that. It is about  dealing with relationships; family, friends and others. It is about the  process of growing up, and all the problems it entails. It is about  frustration and desire and dreams and secret fears. It is about obsession,  in whatever form it takes, and how some people seem to be particularly  prone to it. Which means that, ultimately, I feel that I can identify with  the author in a way that I have not been able to with other books that I  have read. I've now read it seven times in the last 2 years. Every time  that I read I laugh, cringe, get angry and cry at the events that Hornby  relates. One passage has helped me in particular, Hornby writes  &quot;Non-footballing friends and family have never met anyone madder than  I; indeed, they are convinced that I am as obsessed as it is possible to  be. But I know there are people who would regard the level of my  commitment...as inadequate.&quot; If only I could get my wife, family and  friends to read this book I am sure they would look upon me much more  kindly. No matter what your obsession might be, I think that reading this  book will help you to understand yourself just that little bit more.	2000-03-31

Original sin is and, as Blocher points out, has long been a controversial part of church teaching.  While we might recognise that many evil deeds take place in our world, we  are often reticent to label people as sinful from birth. If we are to do  that, the way in which our sinful nature might be passed on is also  difficult to fathom. Blocher begins with both a philosophical and a  scriptural overview of the doctrine, before focussing in on the Genesis  narrative and then Romans 5, the passages which, he argues, have most to  say on the subject. He then moves back out to look at evil in the world and  the way that the doctrine of original sin sheds light on the human  predicament. This leads into a discussion of the transmission of the sinful  nature and the proper response to the recognition of it. Blocher's work is  obviously scholarly, yet a surprisingly easy read despite that. His `take'  on Romans 5 requires more thought on behalf of this reader, but seems both  convincing and helpful. Best of all, it encourages us to look again at the  doctrine of original sin, while remaining focussed on the necessity for  repentance and focus upon the work of Christ in the Christian life. This is  a book well worth having in the library of a thinking Christian.	2000-03-28

Polkinghorne has written a clear and simple (but not simplistic) account of how you can be a scientist and still accept the central truths of Christianity. It is concise and straight to the point, but written so that  even the non-scientific  or non-theologically trained can follow the  argument. This would be an ideal book for anyone who thinks that science  has `disproved' God. Polkinghorne is one physicist who doesn't think so.	1999-07-05
