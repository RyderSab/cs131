I had high hopes for this memoir that haven't panned out.<br /><br />The story is simple on it's surface- a woman grows up in an off kilter family and realises as a young adult that she is adrift because she doesn't \\"know\\" her father.  Of course, she can't because he committed suicide, but what she doesn't have are his stories.  Slowly- and it felt slooow- she sets out to discover what she can about him.<br /><br />She talks to whomever she can locate who knew him, including his childhood friends, and she gets what she can out of her mother who often refuses to talk about any part of her past.  She collects what photographs she can- a task made more difficult because her father was usually the photographer.  She reads his journal and tries to obtain copies of college work, including his undergraduate thesis and tapes of a \\"college bowl\\" contest which \\"put Rennsalaer Polytechnic Institute\\" on the map as a better school than people had previously thought.<br /><br />She experiments with different formats in her writing- including some lists of things he would never know about her, and how she feels that he will always be a man who died at the age of 35.<br /><br />Be forewarned though- it's not an easy book.  It's boggy and uncomfortable.  It very well may be intended to be that way- after all, the subject is a young father and the events leading up to his suicide.  I kept returning to the photo montage in the front, contemplating this beautiful man and wondering what could have caused him to pull the trigger.  of course, only he really knows, no matter what anyone else can say about him.<br /><br />Here's my confession- I haven't finished it.  At 2/3 through, I feel like I know what he did, but his daughter, like all of us, will never really know why.  And he'll stay dead for her- sad as it is.  If I do finish, I wonder if my feelings about the memoir will change.	2005-05-04

This book is a good illustration of that idea.<br /><br />The story is about a minnow and a tadpole.  They look alike, so they must be alike, right?  The frog wakes up to having grown legs and the fish is astounded- this cannot be!  They are both fish!  Time goes on and the fish grows into a larger fish and the tadpole into a frog.  Finally the frog is able to leave the pond, but eventually he returns to tell his old friend about the world.  The fish pictures the birds as colorful fish with wings, the cow as a hilarious furry fish with horns and udders and the people as fish in clothing with hair.  Of course the fish wants to see these amazing things so he jumps out, only to discover that he really needs to be in his cool, watery element to survive.<br /><br />The illustrations are fairly simple colored pencil drawings- at least until we get to the creatures outside the pond.  My children found the \\"birds\\" interesting, but the cow and the humans had them in stitches.  They found those critters to be some of the funniest things they can imagine- and my 8 yo was able to understand and articulate that we base our assumptions on what we already know and understand.  A pretty good lesson for kids to learn, IMO, as well as a sweet story of friendship between two very different creatures.	2005-05-04

Poor Mother Hubbard tries to do right by her dog by immediately dressing in black and buying a coffin, but the darned dog had tricked her and wasn't dead after all!  phew!  Instead, Mother Hubbard goes shopping everywhere for her dear dog- to the barber, the the tailor, the cobbler, the fruit stand, the tavern- but always, when she returns home, the dog is doing something else and doesn't need coffin, the coat, the shoes, the fruit, the wine.  But we do get to see the silliness of the various shop owners and Mother Hubbard in an amazing amount of finery including a fantastic cowgirl outfit all \\"little old ladies\\" should consider wearing.  At least now and then.	2005-05-04

The penguin Nanny is charged with watching 7 little penguins on an outing, but one of them has better things to do than hang out with her and eat his fruit basket.  Instead, he wanders off for various adventures of tummy sledding, goony bird dancing, boating, wild partying and finally, napping on the edge of the ice.  As he does each of these, the Nanny warns the six others that little penguins can get hurt doing those things- but he doesn't until the very end when he gets eaten.<br /><br />End of story.<br /><br />Oh my.  The look on my son's face was even more upsetting than the tears coming out of the six little penguins eyes when they realised the whale had EATEN the adventurous little penguin!  The nanny quickly  backtracks and tells the six obedient penguins that the little penguin could indeed be eaten, but he didn't- he just came home instead.<br /><br />My children like the illustrations, which appear to be pastel on rough paper.  The colors are intense, the penguins attractive and the goony birds have big beautiful eyes.  There's a lot going on at the party and they enjoy talking about the different animals at the party.  It's funny to contemplate the fruit baskets the little penguins get for their outing and wonder why they all eat the same fruit at the same time.  The children liked the food fight, even if I, the mom who would clean up, don't see the point.	2005-05-04

Rosie is off the offal cooking stint- although I'm googling Hungarian recipes right now to see if some of those sound appealing- and is now serving cheap wine to compensate for better cooking.<br /><br />All in all, R is a good adventure to add to the rest of the alphabet and it would stand on it's own just fine too.

Mr. Jones is an advertising executive stressed by his job and his commute who dislikes his boss's sense of humor.  One morning Mr. Jones suggest they switch places-  a plan that is perfect for each of them.  Bea loves being an executive, riding the train, entertaining over lunch and loves the boss's sense of humor.  Mr. Jones is a whiz at color identification, enjoys turning cartwheels and quickly becomes the kindergarten teacher's pet.  After several days of switching, they see no reason to return to the old way of doing things.<br /><br />I love the illustrations as well as the very tongue in cheek text.  The drawings are finely wrought in pencil with great detail and texturing- my son spends time wondering how she could do so much variation with so little.  There a few books with only black and white drawings so this one is fantastic for inspiring aspiring artists.	2005-05-02

I'm surprised to read another reviewer call them \\"dreadful reproductions\\" when I find the work of Tetsu Yamazaki amazing.  I bought this book because the pictures of the sphynx cats was so understanding of them and made them look so appealing and cuddly- I just wanted to own those pictures.  Sphynx are often called \\"hairless\\" and the author makes clear that they are not hairless but are downy, and acknowledges that many people fail to see their charm on first meeting.<br /><br />this is more of a reference or browsing type book so I haven't read it in it's entirety, but the writing is clear and informative.  the illustrations are helpful and the charting of color and pattern reference is easy to follow.  I'm not sure who needs this book but it's certainly a lot of fun to have.	2005-05-02

They NEVER say that about these songs, thankfully and will even sing along with me.<br /><br />The lyrics are funny- and the illustrations fit the sprawling \\"kid look\\".  It often helps to hum the \\"real\\" song before launching into the parody since the tune can often be wiped from memory- maybe it's fear when the melody sees what's going to be done to it.  :-P<br /><br />these songs are great fun for me and my kids.

The cat watches a rain storm, a hunting owl, the roosters, the nighttime= all the wonderful things that cats notice.  Finally, in the morning the cat falls asleep and the little girl starts noticing things the other family members miss.<br /><br />There is an older girl- maybe 6, and a baby boy so this would be a great story for someone who has a new baby sibling.  My favorite human scene is when the mom gets up during the night to feed the baby brother and has a look of peace and contentment- every mother's favorite part of baby nights.  I would have given the book 5 stars if the baby got to snuggle in bed with his mom- it would have seemed just a bit more real.  I still recommend the book highly.	2005-05-02

There are aspects of each book that we have pretty much come to expect over time, and Q doesn't disappoint us.  Or at least me.<br /><br />Q begins with a pair of retired- not by choice- police detectives hoping to \\"save\\" each other by reminding their friend of the good they can do.  Kinsey is hired by a chainsmoking, heaving drinking Con to do the legwork on an 18 old murder case that was left unsolved by the cancer ridden Stacy.  Each believes the other needs something to look forward to in order to survive- and maybe they're both right.  Kinsey takes the case because the pair of \\"old guys\\" remind her of her Private Investigator Mentor/trainers and she seems to feel a little lonely for them.<br /><br />Kinsey almost immediately learns of a few things that were overlooked during the original investigation, or were given too much importance.  She and Con are led off toward Arizona where Kinsey's intuition and persistance lead to an unexpected conclusion of the case.<br /><br />Some of the things we've grown to expect over the almost 20 years we've been able to read Kinsey's history are nicely present in Q.  Kinsey invariably forms a rather close relationship with her employer- better if it's old guys.  Her sexy landlord is on the fringes of the novel but a key part of her life, while her disappointing sex life helps keep her hands off him.  Her family of origin has slowly crept in a little bit more- very slowly- but her \\"family\\" continues to be the people she chooses to be with on a regular basis.  She is curious about her roots, but not so curious as to actively pursue a relationship with her cousins and aunts.  She seems to have completely gotten over her two ex-husbands and is better about keeping away from temptation in the form of men who can't decide if they're committed elsewhere.<br /><br />As usual, the suspect is someone unexpected and Kinsey almost always risks an attack while apprehending them.  Generally it's someone she has been trusting- what a heartbreak that must be for her.  Even knowing this will be the case, I'm almost always pleased with the way we learn the villan's identity since there is always something sinister going on around the discovery.lways risks an attack while apprehending them.

It remains fast paced and interesting, although a sea voyage might seem to have the potential to be boring.<br /><br />The families in steerage are miserable, being a stowaway is stressful and lonely, the first class passengers get to know (and despise) each other.  The crew of the ship is nasty and the passengers are forced into close quarters and filth, yet held in contempt by the very people who arrange it so they live that way.  Of course passengers die on the ship so a little girl is brought into the mix when her parents die- the stowaway is able to leave the ship in a creative manner- engineered by Patrick.<br /><br />Like so many immigrants, these characters are overwhelmed when they reach Massachusetts because they have not arrived in Paradise.  More hard, dangerous work awaits them along with the added anti-immigration, specifically against the Irish, sentiments flooding the East during the mid-1800's.  Sadly, for the Irish, the characters relish any opportunity to earn money.  Even the young English gentleman is proud to begin earning a few  pennies.<br /><br />Young readers will become outraged when they read of the terrible living conditions- again- and the treatment these people receive at the hands of those in power.  There are enough twists in the plot to keep it interesting, but simple enough to keep track of the characters and their shifting attitudes and loyalties.  The pace is fast and suspenseful, the chapters are of varying lengths making it somewhat difficult to put down!  The villans are nasty and get away with more than they should.<br /><br />An excellent introduction to immigrant's lives and struggles during times of great poverty.  Avi needs to write a third book to complete this set to explore how difficult it was to establish a life in a new place, and to see how difficult it was to strike it rich in the California Gold Rush.<br /><br />To an adult reader the character development seemed a bit thin and the cast a little small for the degree of interconnectedness.  I think it's a good level of both of those characteristics for younger readers- maybe a 10 yo if she's interested in the subject would be the youngest who would enjoy this book.reader the character development seemed a bit thin and the cast a little small for the degree of interconnectedness.

How could a *doll* do so much to the family- haunt them through the generations?  It was even more terrifying to me because one of the sisters who possessed the doll was very much like my own sister (before she was possessed by the doll)- I wondered at times what would possess her.<br /><br />I wouldn't want my 10 yo to read this- I think it't suitable for girls who are past the age of actively playing with dolls- for some, there are parts that are not suitable until kids are at least 14 or 15 because some heinous things happen to family members.<br /><br />still, it's obviously a book with a lot of impact since there seem to be many grown women who remembered the book into adulthood.

There is a bit of time spent with the babies and some more thoughtful discussions among them that one would normally expect.  :-P  The talking babies add a nice touch of surrealism, as does the re-knowing that Obee and Mungedeech go through as pre-teens.<br /><br />Even without the touch of surrealism, the subject of being your own best friend and really knowing yourself is an important one for people this age.

The Price family journeyed to the Congo to \\"save souls\\"- as a non-Christian, I find that entire mindset to be belittling to the people who were perfectly happy before the missionaries came.  Instead, I see that Reverend Price marched into a culture about which he knew nothing, tried to force the people to his ways with a rigid, unbending attitude- and worse, endangering his wife and children by doing it.<br /><br />I read this book more than a year ago but some things have stayed with me- the swarm of ants was horrendous, the blind attitude of the missionary dreadful, his treatment of everyone, including a bird was unforgiveable.  The strength the girls showed after their father's dissappearance was, to my reading, phenomenal.  Each life took a vastly different path, but each person was true to her personality.<br /><br />Anti-American?  No- clear on understanding that Americans and US policies are not always good for the people, the US or other nations.  Pro-communist- sheesh- that's a silly thought.

In the meantime though, Sowell has attained a very high status among some parents who speak highly of him and their children who fit the \\"Sowell profile\\".  I don't think it needs to end there though.<br />Sowell became aware that there are many boys who are intelligent, who speak late (and who come from technical families, but that came later), after he mentioned his own son in his conservative column.  Parents began writing to him about their own children and asked his help in finding someone to further their understanding of their children's speech issues.  He sought specialists and researchers interested in compiling the data but couldn't find anyone who wanted to do it.  Happily, from the data as it currently stands, these children will likely have excellent prognoses.<br />Unfortunately, I found Sowell to be judgemental of \\"semi-professionals\\" and of parents who have to utilise school district services for therapy for their children.  Sowell never fully defines a \\"professional\\" nor does he suggest how those of us with balking insurance will get all the coverage we need.  He is, rightly, dismissive of physicians who quickly diagnose children with Pervasive Developmental disorders or autism based on short screenings.<br />I appreciated the section that discusses brain allocation- how the brain might work on one task at a time to the lying by of working on other tasks.  I would like to see a more scientific, rigorous approach to this as it relates to speech development.<br />He is correct in suggesting that some children respond poorly to speech therapy, but I don't believe that dismissing all therapists because of this is the right path.  I know that my later speaking children both responded to some therapists and disliked others.<br />I like to think I trust the range of normal development and my ability to understand my children, but if a parent is worried, this book might be good resource for them.

It certainly works inter-age but problems remain between age-mates. I, too, was a rejected child many times and hate to see any child rejected.<br />The author teaches kindergarten in a Chicago laboratory school and is troubled by the behaviour of children who are excluded and the children who exclude. She explores the idea of setting 'YCSYCP' as a rule by talking to her student and to older students. The younger children have a lot of questions about how the policy will work, and the older children think that if it becomes a rule early on in schooling, it has a better chance of working. Interwoven with the text is a story that the author uses to illustrate these points to her kindergarten students.<br />After reading well into the book, I wondered about the author since the writing seemed so.... simple, and was surprised to read that she had been honored by the MacArthur Foundation for her storytelling in the classroom. I tried to read her interwoven story with a more open mind and found it to help a little in understanding the point of the story.<br />The changes in the classroom as a result of 'YCSYCP' were interesting since the children overall became more inventive and more welcoming, as the author hoped they would. The author was able to define changes she had made in her classroom- like eliminating time-outs- as part and parcel of 'YCSYCP'. I think the simple language worked for these children and could be a good starting place for even older children. As the children mature in their understanding of what happens when the habit of exclusion is broken, they will be able to step back and examine exclusion and rejection in more philosophical terms.<br />I think this book and others you can find like it are worthwhile as people search for ways to make schools more humane and functional for all students, not just the favored.ional for all students, not just the favored.	2004-02-24

Interwoven with the text is a story that the author uses to illustrate these points to her kindergarten students.<br />After reading well into the book, I wondered about the author since the writing seemed so.... simple, and was surprised to read that she had been honored by the MacArthur Foundation for her storytelling in the classroom.  I tried to read her interwoven story with a more open mind and found it to help a little in understanding the point of the story.  <br />The changes in the classroom as a result of \\"YCSYCP\\" were interesting since the children overall became more inventive and more welcoming, as the author hoped they would.  The author was able to define changes she had made in her classroom- like eliminating time-outs- as part and parcel of \\"YCSYCP\\".  I think the simple language worked for these children and could be a good starting place for even older children.  As the children mature in their understanding of what happens when the habit of exclusion is broken, they will be able to step back and examine exclusion and rejection in more philosophical terms. <br />I think this book and others you can find like it are worthwhile as people search for ways to make schools more humane and functional for all students, not just the favored.	2004-02-21

Russell lives in a small winter village and learns the old ways from Oogruk, a blind elder.  Oogruk teaches Russell to hunt and to guide the dogs to travel.  When it is Oogruk's time to stay on the ice, it is also Russell's time to take his journey and discover his song.<br />Along the way, a dream is interwoven with Russell's life.  Life includes a hunt as does the dream, and both versions include death.  In the dream, it is the death of the hunter's family and his dogs; in the dream it is the premature baby of an Inuit girl.<br />Although the story is beautiful and inspiring, I don't recommend it for a child who has a hard time hearing of the death of other children, no matter that most of the deaths were during the Stone Age.  I read this out loud to my daughter and that night she awakened crying during the night.  I had been unable to skim over the deaths of the children, but softened the blow for her by skimming over the dog deaths.  This might be more appropriate for young teens than for pre-teens.	2004-02-02

I didn't think it was all that bad.  Really.<br />Jemima lives in London, has a job she likes, but few friends. and a big crush on a co-worker.  She is overweight because she eats compulsively, but dreams of changing all that and becoming thin and beautiful.  A night in an internet chat room, oddly enough, motivates her to find something else to do- to exercise and not eat all the time and become the New JJ.  This behaviour change is coupled with meeting Brad, who finds her gorgeous without even seeing her, asks for photos and comes on very strong.  Personally, I would have RUN from Brad, but the new JJ is an innocent who doesn't.<br />Brad convinces JJ to visit him in LA where he swoons over her but then isn't really involved in the relationship the way she expected.  The reason why is, well, peculiar, I suppose.  JJ figures out that Brad isn't the guy she thought he was and fortunately decides to get out of there.  Her British friends and new US friends come to the rescue after much mistaken identity.<br />Sure, a woman could change like that.  We all change in our lives and feeling fit and healthy can be the catalyst for a lot of changes.  The writing was good, even if the genre' (chick beach book) isn't what I usually read.  I read it more than a year ago and found it to be more memorable than I expected.	2004-01-14

Understandably, Sam is heartbroken and lonely.  One of her first acts is to go out and spend ridiculous amounts of money at Bloomingdale's and Tiffany, and then give some of her purchases away to a homeless woman, disregarding the fact that they woman would have preferred to get 1/10 of the amount of cash Sam had spent, instead of the extravagent bracelet.  After the spending spree, David cuts Sam off from the checking account.<br />We are not treated to the details of the financial arrangements they make, but Sam decides she wants to keep the house and take in roommates and get a job.  The roommates are the &quot;Open House&quot; and there is some good and some bad from those people.  The jobs, though, are highly unrealistic for someone wanting to keep her expensive home.  These are jobs like laundry attendant, telemarketer (sitting on metal folding chairs!) and other minimum wage jobs- all gotten through a temporary agency.  A few phone calls would have taught the author that the agencies pay about $7/hour- hardly enough to pay for Sam's lovely house.<br />Oh well- if you can overlook that, you might enjoy the novel.  Sam dates a loser or two, while being involved in a lovely friendship with another temp agency collegue.  He is a sweet man and I found myself becoming his advocate.  Travis, Sam and David's son, pops in and out of the novel and deals with the adolescent confusion of his age, and of a child whose parents are divorcing.  Sam undergoes a goodly amount of personal growth while making new friends from some of her housemates, and David undergoes very little.<br />I'd recommend this for fans of Elizabeth Berg, for women wishing for some personal growth of their own, or for anyone wishing to fill a few hours with some fairly light reading.omen wishing for some personal growth of their own, or for anyone wishing to fill a few hours with some fairly light reading.	2004-01-12

We need to provide stimulation and new experiences.  We need to keep the little ones close, provide them security and not force Western-style &quot;independence&quot; on them.  This keeping close means a natural birth, breastfeeding, holding and talking to- not getting our children attached to things.<br />I'm just not certain the author reached his conclusions in a way that I endorse since he says many things I absolutely disagree with.  In the first chapter, he says about our brains and grey matter, &quot;the amount we have is just what we need for certain goals nature has in mind, such as our dominion over the earth.&quot;!  I really have a hard time believing that evolution is goal directed, and that humans should have &quot;dominion&quot; over the earth.  We have no right to that, and we are destroying the earth as a result of trying to be in control of this planet.<br />The chapter on &quot;maintaining the matrix&quot;, or how to birth babies naturally, is taken right out of LeBoyer's work &quot;Birth without Violence&quot;- a fine book but not without it's flaws.  This chapter also explores the development of the naturally birthed and nurtured infant, or at least the ones the author observed in Uganda.  These babies are developmentally ahead of the medically birthed babies in Western society, so he says.  They push up at birth, sit up at a couple months, run (not just walk!) at 7 months of age.  Humph!  Amazing babies, right?  My baby born by c-section walked and talked much earlier than my naturally born-at-home babies.  What happened?!<br />I don't particularly like the language of this book, but it will work for a lot of people.  Many of us in breastfeeding advocacy work learn that people don't always learn intellectually, but they do learn *emotionally*.  If some mothers learn to nurture their babies in a hands-on way because of the emotional discussion in this book, more power to them.  For those of us who learn differently, &quot;So That's what they're For!&quot; or &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; might do the trick.he emotional discussion in this book, more power to them.

Yes, there are people who need this book because they just have too much stuff and there are some who probably need to be shown how to evaluate what they have and what they need. There are certainly many people who shop too much and view shopping as a hobby- I know since I buy their stuff on consignment!  :-) But, the writing style and attitude grated on me and made my brain hurt.<br />The opening quiz; &quot;Junkee Entrance exam&quot; was supposed to figure out how much &quot;help&quot; we need from Mr. Aslett.  Maybe it does that.  The &quot;excuses&quot; chapter seemed less useful since they were so far-fetched.  He is right that clutter makes  life harder in the chapter he calls &quot;Junkicide&quot;, which is pretty much the same as the &quot;economics of clutter&quot;.<br />After we learn what clutter is, overall, we go through houses, offices, clothing and cars.  Sure, there's some good information, but mixed in there's a lot of judgemental stuff.  This is ironic since Mr. Aslett is a Christian- remember &quot;Judge not, lest ye be judged.&quot;  Matthew 7:1?  Maybe people *do* judge his clutter, but it feels invasive to read the way he judges everyone else's!<br />Learning how to Leave the Clutter is probably a learned skilled for people who are overwhelmed with &quot;stuff&quot;, but I would have preferred a more compassionate tone to this book.  Luckily, I can still look at my stuff with an eye to what *I* need, not what Mr. Aslett needs.	2004-01-02

That doesn't hold water, since there was SO MUCH repetition within this book.  The justification just doesn't make sense since so much was repeated in this book.  That is hard to accept since we see so much of the same things said over and over again within this same, 5th novel.  And on it goes, but often with the exact same words instead of different ways of saying the same thing.<br />Hence, it was a tiresome read, but at least I finished it.  I know my husband couldn't even manage to do that.<br />Ayla and Jondalar continue to have *amazing* sex, which we get to read about.  They have their baby, and Ayla continues to insist that the man is responsible for \\"starting\\" the baby.  Too bad- it would have been nice to maintain the Goddess as the important Creator.  :-)<br />Wolf was a nice critter to have around, and I did worry when he was injured and was relieved when  he recovered.  I'd like to have seen more of the people domesticate their animals, including horses or at least consider it.

What message are you giving the baby when she has to eat alone and not with the family?  Yes, it might be difficult to &quot;spoonfeed&quot; the baby, but really, most babies are ready to start eating when they start self-feeding.  Spoonfeeding is a holdover from the days of incomplete infant formulas- parents had to add solids to the baby's diet in order to ensure that she was getting decent nutrition.  A breastfed baby will wisely skip spoonfeeding.  Security *objects* are discussed with little worry- where there should be.  Again, these are baby humans and they need *human* contact, not the substitute contact of a blanket or a bear.  If a child is overly attached to a &quot;thing&quot;, she would probably benefit from more time with her loved caregivers.  When the baby is distracted at nursing, at this young age, it is suggested that the baby may be weaning.  This is absolutely untrue; it is a nursing strike.  Instead of telling mothers that her milk may taste bad, or that the baby's nutritional needs might be changing, mothers need to be told to contact a support person or group like La Leche League and get help getting the baby back on the breast.  ([...]  Weaning from the breast before a baby is one year old is counter to the AAP statement on the Use of Human Milk and is &quot;premature weaning&quot;.  If the baby is just distracted a little, make sure you take time to sit in a quiet room every day and nurse.  Co-sleeping with it's attendant nightnursing are good ways to prevent premature weaning.<br />In the 10th month, we are really, really PUSHED into considering weaning, with more than 2 pages of how to accomplish this.  Again, babies don't need or want to be weaned this early.  Encouragement for long term nursing would be a lot more helpful to most mothers and babies.  We learn that some babies bang their head on the wall or crib and are assured that this is normal.  Again, this is NOT normal.  Family bedded children never engage in this pathological behaviour because they don't need to.  They are well stimulated by the love of their family nearby.  Thinking about those poor babies, craving stimulation or endorphins by headbanging makes me physically ill.  It shouldn't happen.  The section on &quot;discipline&quot; is pretty unnecessary when entire good books have been written on the subject.  I would read &quot;The Discipline Book&quot; by Wm and Martha Sears instead, later reading any of the Faber and Mazlish, or Mary Sheedy Kurchinka's books.<br />To celebrate the 11th month of our babies life, we are just told how to wean our babies, no &quot;ifs and or buts&quot;.  Just wean them.  No reason why.  Poor babies.  Many moms continue to nurse happily after the first year passes, and when they hit this chapter, they realize that their baby is just a baby and still needs mother's milk.  It breaks my heart to think there are mothers, fathers and pediatricians who think that weaning has to happen at this very young age.  Sadly, the box on &quot;raising a healthy heart&quot; forgets to mention that breastfeeding is crucial in maintaining heart, and every other organ's health.<br />The 12th month assumes that weaning has happened and devotes a lot of ink to how to feed the baby who is now missing the most nutritious food that should have been available to her.  It's asking a lot of a mother to wean the baby to worry about diet- I knew my babies were getting sound nutrition from my milk at that age, and my life was easier because of it.<br />This really isn't a book that mothers should be encouraged to read, and I am puzzled as to its popularity.  In part, I think it's because many medical model obstetricians give the pregnancy version away to their pregnant patients, thereby endorsing the entire series.  Bookstores order huge quantities of them, likely due to pricing structures.  When women see the huge stacks of the books, they just &quot;know&quot; it's a good book so they buy it.  Once it's purchased, parenting is made to seem so easy, if you just do things as the book says.  OTOH, I see many of these books in thrift stores and at garage sales that appear unread, so maybe women realize that the book is pretty useless.  Parents, please rely on your intuition and books that empower you like &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by the Sears or Katie Allison Granju's &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot;.  Don't fuel the multi-million dollar baby &quot;thing&quot; industry.

They give the usual sort of things that make breastfeeding look pretty good but optional; designed for \\"your baby\\", better digestability, better absorption of nutrients, convenient, good bonding, etc.  But right away, they set the tone for the whole of the book and come up with some absolutely silly things to say about bottle feeding which I will state as \\"overstuffing the baby\\" (they call it longer satisfaction), easy monitoring of intake (for those who can't judge a happy satisfied baby without a gauge, more freedom (for parents who really didn't' know what having a baby entails), more participation for fathers and sibs (so mom can be left changing the smellier diapers), here's a good one \\"NO interference with FASHION!- can you believe it?  Is fashion so important to anyone that they can't feed their baby what the baby needs?!  Which makes my other point well for me- breastfeeding is not \\"best\\", bottlefeeding is inferior.  Until we get that point across, breastfeeding will always be seen as optional, women will be stressed by it, physicians and nurses won't know how to help, milk banks will be underfunded, donor milk will be suspect, books like this will be authored, and we will  never reach the breastfeeding rates seen in the more civilized Scandinavian countries. <br />The authors explore \\"feelings\\" toward breastfeeding, but make no allowances for how to change those feelings, where to get help, nor do they make any inroads in changing societal views that allow us to sell cars with breasts but not feed our youngest humans with them.   They list reasons that breastfeeding may not work, but provide no resources for how to get help with poor milk supply (an IBCLC or LLLLeader), nor do they provide accurate information on drugs and breastfeeding. <br />Chapter Two covers every consumers favorite subject; shopping.   Just remember; all that stuff can be purchased after birth when you decideyou *need* it, except for a carseat, basic t-shirts, diapers and a baby sling.  Really.  Most of that stuff is just silly to buy until you need it.   Many babies hate cribs, swings, fancy clothes, etc.  The baby needs her loving caregivers, not a chapter worth of purchases. <br />Chapter 3 is about the newborn.   There are a few good breastfeeding tips like, \\"nurse immediately\\" but I would add, \\"don't let them take the baby away at all (ie, room in), and nurse immediately and often\\".   Interestingly, they devote almost as many pages to bottlefeeding, but leave out the important stuff like recording every lot and batch number to check for recalls.  There is some good information in the Q & A section, but double check for accuracy with good lactation consultants, childbirth educators, doulas and other truly knowledgeable people.  <br />Chapter 4, the First Month.  Why does the section on milk expression start out with \\"you see them in rest rooms.....\\"  Um, that is the worst place to express milk for a baby!  There is no warning that cheap breastpumps are often dangerous, hand expression is often easier, and most women really don't need to pump.   The section which covers the slow-gaining baby is mixed- some good information, some wrong, but nowhere does it tell the reader where to get real, in person help- that would be from your La Leche League Leader or IBCLC, btw.   The question on changing one's mind about breastfeeding is odd- the woman who wants to return to breastfeeding is cautioned that she really needs to know she won't change her mind again- like that would be a disaster??  The woman who started breastfeeding and \\"didn't like it\\" at 3 weeks is not informed that it can take as long as 3 mo.s for the reward period to start.  And this is what people call \\"balanced\\"? <br />Chapter 5, the 2nd month.  This is where they suggest supplementing.  Again, the \\"reasons\\" are weak- some good, but included is \\"you wish to be prepared in case the mother becomes ill..  Well, most moms do fine dealing with that if it ever happens, when it happens.  Sadly, the authors leave out mention of \\"nipple preference\\" when the baby finds the bottle easier than the breast, thereby causing premature weaning.   Vaccinations are covered, yet no information on why parents delay is available.  Judgemental words creep in more often at this age- we are asked if we have a \\"difficult\\" baby, rather than a high need baby.  <br />In the 3rd month we are told we might be \\"concerned\\" about schedules and told why we should schedule our babies- no mention that babies change weekly at that tender age and a schedule that works today might not work tomorrow .  Fortunately, we are \\"allowed\\" to wait until the vast age of 6-9 mos to start disallowing the baby from falling asleep at the breast- and we are told why we don't want to do that.  Too bad I've done it successfully at least until my son's 3rd birthday.  3rd *year*, that is.  In the same breath,  we're told to worry about a baby not yet sleeping though the night because nightwaking becomes a habit.  Poor babies.  Lots of their parents don't sleep through the night, ever.  Why should they have to?  Even though they aren't supposed to waken at night, the authors outline all the \\"problems\\" of sleeping with the baby like that the no one sleeps as well- news to me- and here's a great one \\"less lovemaking\\".  Those poor couples with no imagination.    Those same couples also seem to be unable to figure out how to take the baby out since nursing dyads are apparently \\"tied down\\"!  IME, there is no one easier to take out for a nice dinner than a little happy nursling.  Unfortunately, the authors think that if you do take the baby out, you and the baby can go into the bathroom to nurse.  YUCK!  In 9 years of nursing, I've never nursed in the toilet!	2004-01-02

At least, not the story of March and Hollis.  It wasn't love, it was control and a deep seated hatred of humans on the part of Hollis.  Hollis, the definition of \\"sociopath\\", which this book defines better than dictionary.com does, as \\"One who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior\\" was detestible, yet brilliant.  Anti-social was only part of this guy's problems.  There was also his need to control, as well as maladjustment possibly caused by PTSD.<br />But I get ahead of myself.<br />I liked March and Gwen when they arrived in Jenkintown for Judith Dale's funeral.  I even liked March's brother Alan.  Getting into the story of the past, I was appalled by Alan's treatment of \\"the boy\\" as he called Hollis when he first arrived in their home.  Hollis was well treated by the adults and March, but not by Alan and his friends.  Still, he didn't seem to be broken then.  I still liked Hollis when he was gone from March, because I didn't know what he was doing.<br />I started to loathe him when he returned and started calling March, who had moved away and married Richard, a man Hollis viewed as one of his rivals in property ownership and respect of the community.  The statement that turned me around on him was when he told the very pregnant March, \\"you care more about that baby than you do about me.\\"  Yup, I would have said.  I sure do.  \\"That\\" baby is my baby and you are an adult. Grow up.  Warning bells would have gone off for me, but they didn't for March.  Too bad.<br />Gwen certainly reformed when she found something outside of herself to care for in the former racehorse, Tarot.  I could visualize that the horse loved her and responded well to her because he was reminded of the gentle Belinda, his former rider and mistress.  I was relieved that Gwen and Hank could form their relationship in an adult, responsible manner; with neither falling into the obsessive behaviour  that had marked March and Hollis's relationship, even from the beginning.  My God!  How could anyone have lived like March and Hollis did, even as teenagers?!<br />Hollis didn't try to be subtle at all in his attempts to control March.  Had March been awake, she would have seen that when her oilburner and her car mysteriously gave out and Hollis wasn't able to fix them.  Had she not seen that, there was a huge clue when Hollis took March away from the Harvest Fair.  But like so many abused women, she didn't see, or want to see.  She didn't see his violence even when he threatened her daughter and the animals she loved.  Many women don't.  March was very enmeshed in her \\"relationship\\" with Hollis, but thankfully, Alice Hoffman allowed her to find her way out, if only due to an accident at the infamous devil's corner.  It could have been much, much worse, and in real life, it is.<br />To give her the benefit of the doubt, for a long time, March saw Hollis as the boy he was; before he became \\"Mr. Death\\".  Still, trauma doesn't excuse his barbaric actions towards her and everyone else.<br />I used to think that if I disliked the characters of a novel, I could dismiss the novel as \\"not very good\\".  No more.  I despised Hollis, but the art it takes to create an evil person like him is immense.  To continue to work with a horrible character that the author surely hated as well takes a lot of fortitude.  Thank you for persevering,  Alice Hoffman!s's relationship, even from the beginning.

After all, someday soon my children will grow up and I'll need this book in case I decide to be a slacker!  Just kidding!	2003-12-31

She says good-bye to her mother and strikes out on her own to beautify a boarding house.  Her gifts are rejected by the staff there, sometimes even before she has a chance to spin them, but fortunately she discovers a young woman resident, knitting.  The spider realises that she is knitting for a baby, but before a blanket can be knitted, she runs out of yarn.  Sophie steps in to make the blanket for the baby, and the young woman accepts it with happiness.<br />The illustrations are nice, even if the spider is a little silly with her 8 multi-color socks.  The picture of the mother with her baby in a bassinet by her bed is sweet, as the mother sleeps with her hand on her baby.  I can only imagine that soon the little one will be snuggled in bed with her mama and they will both be wrapped in the blanket made by the caring spider.	2003-12-30

Before considering further on what birth and baby care books to purchase, people need to realize that the Ezzo's are ostensibly religious figures, removed from ministry in multiple churches and credited with authoring the secular version of the religious books that have led to Failure to thrive infants, and children with attachment disorder.  I really hope no one really wants to start on that path with their infant.<br />The subtitle of this book is mentions birthing \\"by Design\\".  Physiologically oriented parents need to understand the \\"Design\\" is referring to Creation \\"Science\\" \\"intelligent\\" design, not to anything based on biological fact.<br />The information given here wasn't written by Gary Ezzo but by a consortium of a couple nurses, a few MD's and a couple CNM (certified Nurse-Midwives).  It's a medical model book on birth, with no entries in the index for \\"homebirth\\" or \\"doula\\", so expect no discussion on anything outside of hospitals and birth centers.  The sections on labor read pretty much like the soft \\"What to expect when You're Expecting\\", a book renowned for it's lack of empowering information.  There are a couple pages on positions for pain relief, but not enough to help a woman avoid a medicalized birth or to even understand why drugs in labor are dangerous to her and her baby.<br />One brief chapter on feeding infants includes the tired statement \\"there are advantages and disadvantages to both bottle feeding and breastfeeding\\", disregarding the 100+ citations on the risks of formula feeding at the end of the AAPediatrics Statement on the Use of Human Milk.  I wonder what disadvantages to breastfeeding there might be other than this absurd statement, paraphrased, \\"deciding how to feed an infant needs to me a family decision based on whether or not the mother can be well nourished and well rested enough to breastfeed the baby.\\"  !!! Well, the last time I looked, it was metabolically more difficult to be pregnant than to breastfeed, and if the mother is so darned worn out from baby care, she most certainly does not have the extra energy one needs to bottle feed!  Bottle feeding is expensive, difficult to do safely and a mother has the constant worry of whether or not the pharmaceutical company has made a manufacturing mistake.  Certainly a mother would be better rested knowing that her baby is fed the food that God or Nature intended!<br />The final pages of the books contain various \\"scientific\\" appearing charts, including a goal sheet for post-partum.  By one week post partum, moms are supposed to shower by noon, by two weeks they need to be dressed by noon and by 3 weeks, they need to have their make-up on by noon!  Whoa!  In the real world of nurturing, the baby really doesn't care what the mom is wearing and probably prefers the un-made-up face anyway.  Oooops!  In the Baby(un)wise series, DAD is the all important God designated family head and decider of all things.  I guess that's why Mom needs to worry about those things.  Here's a tip Mom- throw out the schedules, attend to baby, your rest and nursing.  Everything else will follow in it's time.  After all, Mary (remember, the Mom who gave birth to Jesus?) didn't have a clock, a schedule or make-up to put on.  She had a baby who needed her love, her milk and her physical presence.  The Ezzos will appear truly Godly when they realize that those are the important things in life.  Just don't get caught up in the Ezzo plans before *or* after birth.l nourished and well rested enough to breastfeed the baby.\\"  !!!

US	53025502	R9XTV2OUBNI1F	0805067248	524632007	A Map of the Child: A Pediatrician's Tour of the Body	Books	3	28	85	N	N	Where is the chapter on Immunology?	I wanted this book when I was pregnant with my 3rd child- a step by step guide through the child's body.  The chapters included are Lungs, Heart, Blood, Bones, Brain, Skin, Gonads, Guts.  Each chapter includes a nice discussion of how the organ or set of organs, are supposed to function and a few case studies on what can go wrong with them.<br />Darshak Sanghavi strikes me as a very intelligent, compassionate and caring pediatrician.  He attended Harvard Medical School and trained at Boston's Children's Hospital.  Generally only the most successful of students have those opportunities.  Darshak attends summer camps for kids with cancers and makes his way to a Navajo reservation to practice pediatrics- presumably his education was paid in part because of an agreement to work in underserved areas.  Over the course of the book, he talks about the extra time he spends with his young patients, making them comfortable and explaining their illnesses to their parents.  Noble goals, all in all.<br />Unfortunately, the author misses a crucial chapter when he fails to include Immunology, and he apparently hasn't read the American Academy of Pediatrics Statement on the Use of Human Milk.  This statement includes over 100 references, citing the need for human babies to receive their mother's milk for at least the first 6 months of life.<br />Why is this significant?  In his chapter on Blood, a child undergoes a bone marrow transplant.  It has been well documented that organ transplants are more successful if the recipient was breastfed as a child.  It would have been useful to see mention of this fact.  No one expects their child to have an organ transplant, but I think all mothers would do whatever they could to ensure that the child survives one.  Sadly, this child didn't.<br />I'm not sure if Darshak really likes seeing mothers parent instinctively or naturally.  The same chapter opens with the only account of a homebirth in the book and leads to the case of a child with hemorrhagic disease of the newborn or HDN.  Homebirths are safer than hospital births and the outcomes for the baby are much better when the child is born at home.  I don't find it coincidental that the author chose this family to illustrate a very rare condition that could happen in the hospital as well as at home.  After all, any mother can decline the Vitamin K injection for her baby.<br />The chapter on Bones includes a lengthy review of a child abuse case and a discussion on medical findings in abuse.  Artificially fed infants are at greater risk of being abused by their parents than are breastfed babies.  Pediatricians need to let parents know that their job as parents will be more stressful when they bottle feed their baby rather than breastfeeding.  In the case study in the book, it was a nanny who abused the child, not the parent, but it is an important piece of information that parents need to know.<br />In Guts, a small, but important piece of information is left out.  The chapter includes an 8 year old girl who is diagnosed with Insulin Dependant Diabetes Mellitis (IDDM) and we read that \\"no preventable risk factors have been identified\\".  Had Dr. Sanghavi read the literature published in the Lancet, among other journals, he would have learned that early introduction to cow's milk is a significant risk factor in developing IDDM.  Most infant formulas are cow's milk based, therefore, most infants not breastfed have early cow's milk exposure.  If parents are given that knowledge, that is an easily prevented risk factor.  Why did this pediatrician fail to give it in this easily read form?<br />The infant who is dehydrated at the beginning of this same chapter is also a breastfed (all one word, no hyphen) baby.  Rarely do breastfed babies suffer diarrhea, rarely do mothers have a hard time keeping up with their child's needs.  Human milk is a very effective oral rehydration therapy, and in most cases, it is a fantastic, free option.  The case study would have been more believable had the child been a formula fed child, as they are significantly more likely to suffer early rotovirus infections than a naturally fed baby.<br />Immunology is a very important part of anyone's organism.  A chapter that includes the many ways in which the infant humans immune system is unfinished at birth and how species specific milk completes the immune system is sorely lacking.  Parents need to know that the live antibodies and macrophages are present in the milk of the mother.  Formula is a dead substance from an animal intent on building muscle mass- human milk grows fantastic brains and healthy immune systems.  Why wasn't that chapter written for this otherwise well written book?<br />I think I read the main reason in the last two pages, after the physician's first child is born.  He tells little about the birth, but it was obviously not a homebirth.  Then he writes about his son's first night, when he and his wife \\"took turns feeding him\\".  Clearly, he has failed to understand that there are risks to not breastfeeding and he and his wife are willingly taking risks with their child's health.  That is a sad decision they have made for this baby because of the risks to him and because of the example they are setting for their patients and for readers of this book.  Parents and children deserve better than that from this skilled author and physician.would have been more believable had the child been a formula fed child, as they are significantly more likely to suffer early rotovirus infections than a naturally fed baby.<br />Immunology is a very important part of anyone's organism.

I wasn't sure what I expected- sweet, silly, maybe even maudlin women making itchy clothes and quilts, shocked because a beautiful woman with career aspirations moved into their midst, I guess.  Yes, the women made quilts, but I bet I would love to own one.  Yes, a career woman moved in, but the group wasn't all that shocked by her.  I had no idea that *violence* would be the theme.<br />Queenie and Grover had a very real relationship and worked well together.  They were both pragmatic about the arrival of Zepha and Blue onto their land; the reality of the lives of the &quot;squatters&quot;.  They dealt well with the loss of their fertility but celebrated the arrival of a baby in their life later.<br />I loved the descriptions of the homes, furnishings and decorating touches of the members of the club used in their homes.  I've sat on old horsehair couches and appreciated the description of the slippery, itchy old things.  I loved mention of the paintings that no would want to look at because they've seen it already in everyone else's home.<br />The feeling of the town was real, and insular.  Those little towns can be tough to live in, just as they can be tough to convey to other people who haven't lived in them.  Everyone knows the secrets and you have to leave to escape them!<br />Women need their own version of the Persian Pickle Club- they need to get together and support each other, even if they don't spend their time quilting.  The feeling of intergenerational friendship was strong and true, and I hope it still happens in little and big Kansas towns.	2003-11-07
US	53025502	RL2F9RM2MTG6V	0316586900	953096350	The Siberians	Books	4	8	14	N	N	Why did communism collapse?	I envy Farley Mowat and his wife Claire for their journey throughout Siberia in the 19060's.  Communism was roaring along very well, the Small People of the North (the Native Siberians who had small numbers) were holding on to the past and embracing the present.  The State was, overall, welcoming to this Canadian writer, and the people were amazingly hospitable.  Farley and Claire were able to see the Sleeping Giant as few others were able to, probably even most Soviet citizens.<br />While I read of the amazing technological wonders, the fantastic movement of goods, the incredible food and drink, the wonderful education that anyone was able to get, I had, in the back of my mind a huge dose of skepticism.  A Soviet explained to the author that *they* knew what was propaganda and what was the truth, whereas North Americans are just the opposite, swallowing marketing and political propaganda without guile.  Because the US government is in the midst of a propaganda war, that people actually believe Fox news, that the US has been involved in another oil war, well, yes, I can believe that.  I do worry about the path the North of Asian Russia has taken since the fall of communism and what the US style capitalists are doing to the well made plans of the 1960's.<br />I recommend this book, although it is not an easy nor quick read.  The author complains about being bogged down in statistics from proud Siberians, and I felt the same way from him.  Some of the organisation seemed a bit scattered; we seemed to return to similar themes, yet in different settings. It was also impossible to tell where the author went on which trip, or even how many trips he took to Siberia.  Overall, that doesn't matter I suppose.	2003-10-20

You can hear the voices of the authors in their descriptions if you're lucky enough to have heard them before you read this little guide.<br />The best thing about this book is gaining inspiration for travelling to smaller, remote out of the way places, based &quot;merely&quot; on an All-American restaurant review- but you know, some of my most memorable meals have been in places like the ones Jane and Micheal suggest.

How can I, a mere mortal, say anything about Joyce Carol Oates' incredible writing?  How can I say anything meaningful about the twists and turns that the plot takes?  The suprises that lurk?<br />In the opening pages, I didn't like Adam.  Nope.  Not at all.  I thought he was a fake, a fraud, a man who played with the hearts of women and was untrustworthy to men.  His small redeeming quality was that he owned a Siberian mix- a rescued dog at that.  No one who lives with the wily ways of a Sibe can be all bad.  :-)<br />He started redeeming himself to me a little by saving the child, but only a little since she would have been saved no matter what he did.  When Marina Troy came into the picture, I thought she was overdone and overly dramatic.  But then, *more* women came in and I started to really wonder about the man.<br />Joyce Carol Oates can write like no one else and her characters move through so much and are so much themselves.  There is tragedy and joy- there is complexity.  I have a hard time putting down anything she's written.<br />this novel isn't as dark as \\"We were the Mulvaney's\\" but it is nearly as powerful.	2003-09-14

I had drifted away from eating meat without even noticing, the first time I ever had to fend for myself in the kitchen.  After a couple months of eating eggs and cheese I concluded I had to learn to really be a vegetarian.  This book helped me understand the basics of a healthy diet that wasn't just &quot;meatless&quot;, it had totally forgotten about meat.<br />There are some recipes that are just plain nice to know about like the fruit compote from dried fruit, some of the delicious non-yeasted breads, (I'm too distracted to make good yeasted breads without my bread machine), and the various sauces for vegetables.  It would be lovely to make everything from scratch like Laural and company did, but I just don't have the wherewithal to spend that much time in the kitchen anymore.<br />I was vegetarian for 14 years but started eating meat again when pregnant the first time.  Now that my children are getting older and able to appreciate foods that are combined, I plan to get out my copy of Laural's Kitchen and use it more.  Even if they balk, I'll be adding various side dishes, some of the lovely sauces so I can dress up my servings of vegetables and introduce my kids to more vegetarian dishes.  Even while I haven't been using these recipes, I've appreciated the comprehensive nutrient charts as a reference.	2003-08-18

Dogs don't have the lifestyle they did in the 1920's and 1930's in remote Canada, and sadly, boys don't either.<br />Mutt is a fascinating mutt with a mind of his own; halfway through the book I realised he must be part Siberian Husky with his deafness, his love of roaming and chasing and need to attend to his own desires.<br />Farley's mother demonstrated an act of faith- as well as the desire to save [money amount]- when she purchased Mutt as a puppy from a starving duck seller.  Farley's dad wanted a hunting dog; Farley's mom didn't want to spend a lot of money on a dog during the Dust Bowl years, living in Saskatoon.<br />Dogs roamed free, boys roamed free.  Boys weren't sent off to summer camp to keep busy- there was enough to do with their own imaginations, their friends and their animal companions.  Attitudes towards cats were cavalier; some parts are very hard to read if you appreciate cats.  Thankfully that attitude has changed over time.<br />The stories of the father's boating attempts are hilarious.  I don't like boats, but am inspired to read \\"the boat that wouldn't float\\" by the same author.  I live in the western US and have a vague understanding of how difficult it would be to navigate some of these rivers so I appreciated the delusional voyage of The Coot.<br />Farley paints his parents as people who had their own interests and needs, but also understood the needs of their son and his dog.  They understood that living in a city wouldn't work for them, after several years living in the sparse western provinces.  Farley's imagination was clearly nurtured and allowed him to become the prolific writer he became.  Even the car (Eardlie, a Model A) has a character and idiosycrasies that add to the story.<br />My dog, too, is geriatric so I read the final chapter sadly.  Mutt's demise will give fuel to the arguments of people who believe completely in leash laws.<br />Yes, this is a fantastic story of a dog, but it is also a wonderful story of life in a more free time, for children.  Farley skips over most of the drawbacks of that time and paints a wonderful portrait of childhood.dog, but it is also a wonderful story of life in a more free time, for children.

It was fascinating to read Holly's account of how she rediscovered herself and to read the details of her life that she utterly forgot and confused her.  How could anyone forget their own beautiful pooches?  The rice in the backpacks was indeed a nice baffling touch, though I knew what its purpose was before Holly figured it out.  Her account of her terrible handwriting was amusing to anyone who has gone back to reread something and found it mystifying.  The details seemed so genuine to me that I even awakened after reading the book, afraid I had forgotten my own life!<br />Holly is a total dog nut, but comes by it honestly since her parents were, she has lovely dogs (enough to make anyone nuts about dogs), dated a vet.  Her discovery of that, and the &quot;tape recorder&quot; that went off in her mouth when the Malamutes were mistaken for &quot;huskies&quot; was priceless.<br />What was not so priceless was the insidious crime committed by the dangerous, misguided villan.

And he's right.  Poor kiddos; dreadful things happen to them but they have each other.<br />The writing style is a rather dry, but humorous.  The villan is over the top- filthy, shiny, with icky tatoos, nefarious plots, and worse friends.  Violet and Klaus each have admirable characteristics; Violet is an inventor, Klaus is an avid reader.  Sunny didn't seem so sweet initially because she is a biter, but she isn't a random, vindictive biter.  The children (or orphans!) may seem to be lacking depth, but Lemony Snicket just doesn't go deeply into detail on their emotional lives.  Yes, they miss their parents, they cry, but he doesn't dwell on it.<br />I saw through the evil plan of Count Olaf right away, as well as the general idea the books will follow, but I'm not 8.  Younger children will be held in suspense a bit longer than most adults.  :-P<br />My 8 year old daughter doesn't like these books yet.  She doesn't have a droll sense of humor that is necessary to appreciate them, and she has a huge fear of Bad Things Happening to Babies; a Bad Thing happens to Sunny, at which point my daughter slammed the book shut and declared it dreadful.  I might have her skip the first book and go to the second............. oh, but she might not like having snakes portrayed as Bad Guys.<br />I would certainly recommend these books over the Goody Two Shoes \\"Boxcar Children\\".  These have depth, humor, include new vocabulary words, and fantastical situations.	2003-02-10

She believes a young man that he has fallen in love with her and will run away with her to marry. This was viewed as a terrible scandal by the petty members of the community, &quot;forcing&quot; her guardians to find a farmer for her to marry; a dreadful creature. This is the beginning of her fall, and she falls and falls for some number of years following. She ecapes to a city- was in New York? and makes her way as a well brought up young woman forced to do so in a man's world. Men were essential to women for their livlihood, and a woman without reputation and introduction were cast adrift with dreadful housing, horrible food, terrible job prospects, if they can even be called a job. The gap between rich and poor was tremendous even then, and literally pennies were all that were needed to improve the lot of the &quot;working poor&quot;, just as is the case now. The lot of the workers was easily improved, and it was tragic to see how callous the manufacturers were to the needs of their laborors.<br />Susan, luckily, &quot;rises&quot; but has a talent and ability to develop it that so few have.

Several lactation consultants and I had recently been discussing arrogant, &quot;fertility experts&quot; who were cruel to their patients, badgered them, reduced them to tears with every visit, forbade them to see lactation consultants- but yet, parents were grateful because the &quot;expert had given them their baby&quot;!  Egads!  Parents, parent hopefuls and everyone- stand up for your rights and don't let the specialists own you!<br />I am also on a personal journey toward greater health through yoga, Nia and improved diet, (but not quite back to the heyday of my vegetarian days).  My aches and pains have decreased and my energy levels improved.  Julia just reinforced what I already knew but was having a hard time putting into practice.<br />Julia had to write this book.  Anyone with health issues would be well advised to read it.  People need to learn to be responsible for themselves.  Doctors need to understand that they are human too, and can have a profound impact on their patients, beyond the obvious.  Julia won't tell you how to improve your fertility.  She will tell you what she did and what she learned along the way, and help you find the beginning of your own work.  That is much more valuable than a guidebook because you need to own your health.<br />This is a very quick read.  I read it in mostly one night- I was hooked.  I wanted to find out more about how she was helping herself.  I knew she would end up pregnant and I was eager to learn what she and her husband did- I hoped for an unassisted pregnancy.<br />I would have liked to hear just a tiny bit about her birth and babymoon with her new daughter.  Culturally we need to hear more about breastfeeding, especially following infertility.	2003-01-21

Kaya is no exception.<br />Kaya's life, although very different than ours, is easy to imagine for children.  There is enough detail for them to understand the community and community feeling of Kaya's group of Nez Perce.  The characters are firmly developed, and unlike a teen reader, my daughter has no difficulty figuring out the roles each person plays, even though they don't necessarily use familiar terms like \\"mother\\" and \\"grandfather\\".<br />Kaya teaches my child that the Native Americans had dignity, a wonderful lifestyle, respect for nature, love for their families, as well as rights to live the lives they saw fit.  Too bad that adults who destroyed the culture believed otherwise.  Eventually, through the series, these issues are explored in the \\"Looking Back\\" section.	2003-01-19

In this story, we learn how Yellow Jackets got their black striping and why fire comes from wood.  Coyote is sweet and knowlegable; less of a trickster than he often is, and more caring of the animal community than usual.<br />The illustrations are beautiful and remind me of Jan Brett's.  They have good detail and personalities on the animals faces.  My favorite aspect of each animal though, was the token clothing or jewelry.  Coyote wears a hat, eagle wears a necklace, fox has earrings.  None of the jewelry are blatent but are subtle and understated, appearing as though the animals are comfortable in their adornments.	2003-01-18

They are well illustrated, generally with animals playing the characters.  The pages are sturdy, which is very important in a large book that they will want to study on their own.  The songs are cute and with enough musicial detail to figure out the tune, even if unfamiliar with it previously.  OTOH, over time, the volume fades so it's important to learn the songs.<br />My children have learned simple matching skills by studying the books on their own.  The buttons are a snippet of the illustration so they figure out the gist of what they're supposed to do to hear the appropriate song.  They can review the songs on their own, over and over again, but they're fun to sing together too.  I prefer the songbooks over the \\"hit the button for an illustrative sound\\" type of books because there is better continuity.  I believe they can both be effective in teaching reading, but the song books make it more fun for both the parent and the child.	2003-01-18

My eldest was terrified by this book when she was 4- I don't blame her!- but started to like it a couple of years later.  The storyline is dark as are the illustrations, but they're also well rendered.<br />There are many obvious messages in the story- the mother leaves the children alone with explicit directions, which they disregard to their detriment!  The witch is portrayed as the post-Pagan era Evil Witch, and not a positive Healing Witch.  Even worse, she wants to eat the children.  Yikes!  The Mother though, is able to Save Her Children because she loves and understands them well and pays attention to their needs.<br />My daughter's fears stemmed largely (I believe) from her fear of bad things happening to young children.  If your child feels that way, this might be a scary book for her.  My younger daughter never disliked the story though, but she has a different kind of analytical mind and probably didnt' suspend reality to allow the children to turn to food.  :-)	2003-01-18

Many ring true for cat lovers, and probably cat dislikers as well, since they decribe cats we've known and loved, behaviour people have engaged in, or things we've thought about our kitties.<br />It's a great source of changing sig files, like \\"Most of us rather like our cats to have a streak of wickedness.  I should not feel quite easy in the company of any cat that walked about the house with a saintly expression.\\" ~Beverly Nichols, \\"If cats could talk, they wouldn't.\\" ~ Nan Porter<br />A nice little book to have around to lighten the day.	2003-01-18

Fortunately, the party giver forgives Hooper for his failings and invites him after all.  Phew!<br />This is an alphabet book in disguise because the guest list is written in alphabetical order.

I did too, when I was young.  (actually, I like some now too.  :-)  )<br />Sadly, I found the characters to be very shallow and too cheerful.  When the art supplies were stolen, the children basically said, \\"Oh darn.  Well, let's buy some more.\\"  When their work was destroyed they said, \\"Oh, shucks.  Well, we'll do it again.\\"  When they started their business to raise money for the hospital (which I though was a great thing to suggest to children), they *instantly* had a full load of clients and the ability to carry out every task perfectly.<br />The kids are just too perfect to be realistic.  Other than that, my 8 yo seems to be very enthusiastic about the series.  If they are properly researched, children may learn a few snippets of information with each one they read.  If the child puzzles over the mystery, they might serve a little purpose of stimulating creative though.	2003-01-18

The \\"scientific\\" explanation at the beginning is cute and lends a touch of authenticity to the story- after all, Blancofelis dexterodactylus *must* exist if this kind of information is available on them. :-)<br />The story illustrates that many of us just don't see what we don't expect. Most humans are pretty wrapped up in our own lives, after all and wouldn't see Trupp visiting the city either. Of course, a lot of people don't see the homeless either so it's appropriate that the homeless people are the *only* ones who see Trupp.<br />Trupp gets tired quickly and wants to go home after only one night with the humans. Initially the ending felt very abrupt, but when I thought of how quickly children want to stop doing things sometimes, it made more sense. How many of us have spent an hour getting a child to an art exhibit or playdate, only to have the child ready to leave before we're even settled? That's the feeling Trupp's departure gave me.<br />This isn't the authors best, but the illustrations are charming. It can provide a springboard for discussing homelessness and other \\"different\\" people. Another reviewer stated that children don't expect a children's story to discuss homeless people, but if children see them around, they'll need to learn about them.	2003-01-18

If a child is fed a combination of artificial food and breastmilk, absorbtion in the gut is modified so that viruses and proteins pass through more easily.  To keep the gut intact, a mother should feed *only* breastmilk.  There is a large body of research supporting exclusive breastfeeding and decreased HIV transmission.<br />Women in developing nations are often stimatised for bottle feeding because it is taken as an admission that she is positive for HIV.  This leads to the very dangerous practice of mixed feeding, because women bottle feed in private and breastfeed in public.  Women must be given *accurate* information that prevents this practice.  They must be given enough information to nourish their babies as they see fit.	2003-01-18

You can chose how many layers to read, depending on the child's interest and on the time you have available for reading.<br />The obvious layer is the text.  There is plenty of information from just reading the text.  If you want to add more, read the dialogue between the characters, written cartoon style in balloons.  The most detail would come from the children's sketches and notes that are in the (very wide) margins.<br />I like the scheme of taking the children through the system and coming out the other end.  Children usually find the fantasy of changing size to be fascinating as well.  To my knowledge, the book is factual and fairly well up to date.<br />As a seamstress, I love Ms Frizzle's clothing and accessories.	2003-01-18

Lorna/Laurie's relationship with her cat seemed, at times, to be more important to her than her dear, frustrated (and frustrating) sister.<br />Never did we learn what Lonnie's illness is, what was being done for her, how she was educated, what her prognois was, how she acted that was violent (other than the unusual toys and the interesting pets)- Lonnie clearly lacked depth.  Why mention the sister in the title if the novel was to be entirely about Lorna?<br />Other reviewers have suggested that Lorna/Laurie is self-centered, but that is to be expected.  This is a memoir of an actor/writer, after all.  The point of a memoir is to focus on one's life- and a actor is supposed to present herself.<br />Lorna/Laurie had a typical, freak, suburban upbringing in the 60's.  The major difference is that she had a lot of stress at home, without enough support for herself, for her mother, and for her father.  Even Lonnie appeared to not be well-supported by her therapists.  Hopefully, people who work with the mentally ill and their families have learned over the decades to support them as they have learned with other forms of more visible illness.<br />A better memoir to explore the flaky family and the ensuing sister entanglement is \\"The Liar's Club\\".  Truly a wonderful read.	2002-06-23

No one denies that.  But this account of their ordeal missed the opportunity to make their pain known to the world.<br />Never did I feel the suffering come through the pages of the book.  Never did I feel what it was like to be there.  The pain must have been dreadful, but the shallowness of the presentation made it very forgettable.<br />I don't know if this presence was missing because the events were dictated to the writer, and therefore lost in the second person, or if they were lost because Malika Oufkir didn't tell the story in her native language.  The pain that came through most clearly was the pain the family felt *after* their jail release, during the time of house arrest.  I felt their pain at having missed out on so many years of their lives, but not at the great injustices meted out to them.<br />I'm afraid that with such shallow accounts of their imprisonment, many people will not feel a strong motivation to speak out for human rights abuses, such as theirs.	2002-06-23

I had heard often of parents using baby signs but had never really considered it myself.  Now I wish I would have, because my daughter *loves* to use sign.  I chose a &quot;real&quot; sign language instead of creating signs, as some parents choose to do, because I wanted consistancy, uniformity and the chance that their signing might come in handy with a signing person.

Almost like Harry didn't have to be fully fleshed out, as a character, in order for the author to understand him.  On the other hand, the rest of the characters were pretty weak too.<br />I liked Harry, as much as he was, and Catherine was ok, but probably not someone I'd seek out.  Carter was dreadful.  I couldn't stand the grubby, grabby pretender that he seemed to be.  When he behaved well, I was surprised.  When he behaved as he normally did, I was repelled.  The kids were minor characters, and not very real or true.  The relationships to each other were thin and lacking in depth.<br />Gardeners might like Catherine's garden and cooks might like her meals.  Wood choppers will wonder why she was chopping wood on the concrete floor of her barn and why she didn't dislocate her shoulder when she hit the floor with her axe.  Liberals will laugh to hear themselves discussed so blatently negatively.  Women will wonder about some people's attitudes toward sex.	2002-01-22

I like the idea of fetching books- I love books so the task would be appealing to me.<br />From my reading of Viking raids, it is very likely that raids took place as described here, against the Irish monks.  Vikings were in search of stored foods, wealth and whatever else they could grab on a quick morning attack.  There would have been many ships and a fast assault as portrayed here.  Many aspects of the raids were left out, and that is just fine for the young school-age reader.<br />These are chapter books that can be easily read by an advanced first grader over several days, or read as bedtime stories by parents over one or two evenings.  There are some illustrations to augment the storyline, but the main focus of the book is the text.	2001-10-14

Period.<br />I dont' believe that this curriculum provides anything that a school can't provide with other, better educational methods.  The example of why this by-rote schedule is necessary is ludicrous.  They offer a classroom of children beginning to learn about world exploration and Magellan.  The children are asked to trace a route on a globe from Europe to North America, but some can't because they &quot;didn't do that last year in Mrs. Jones' class&quot;, others in &quot;Mr. Peach's class did that last year&quot; and the children who just moved in from another school &quot;did Magellan last year&quot;.  I would be surprised if any child with basic map literacy couldnt' find a route on a globe, and for the children who did that last year, they should be able to offer different, possibly more complex views on the subject.<br />Any child exposed to a library or even a small home book collection should be able to have the &quot;cultural literacy&quot; base this curriculum would like to provide.  The cultural background presented in this book is weak, without any discussion of where these fairy tales and nursery rhymes came from.  No child needs to learn &quot;Jack Horner&quot;, etc.  in school.  If it is taught, it should be at a level where the child will learn the origins of these things, and maybe learn to act them out.<br />The history portion was severely limited.  Most children will pick up the very basic elements of what was offered just by looking at and asking about the presidents on our money.<br />Math is very weak.  Again, talking with your child and reading a few basic books would teach everything offered here.<br />I explored several &quot;focus&quot; schools in my district for my daughter.  After looking into Core Knowledge, we named it &quot;American Myths and Legends&quot; and rejected it for our child as too rigid, without an ability to meet the needs of specific children.  In some districts, a core knowledge school may work as a selection factor, if it is one of the only choices available.  Parents who care about their children's education may send their children to the available magnet school, so the school may well be populated with families who care about education.  It doesnt' work that way in practice in all districts though.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that this curriculum was established by concensus.  Therefore, anything viewed as &quot;radical&quot; or outside of the mainstream would not have passed the review committees.  I think they probably lost a lot of value due to the process.<br />If you are starting a new school in your district or looking to homeschool a child to make sure she loves learning, look into William Glasser's  &quot;Quality School&quot;.

I didn't feel like that information was there- the family could have just as easily been in Oregon or Tasmania for all I knew.  Nothing made me feel like I was really there in Lapland with them.<br />Considering what the book was, instead of what it wasn't, it was ok.  The Franzons had a powerful faith that was present in their everyday lives.  They seem to have been Baptists, rather than Lutherans, the current Swedish majority.  They lived by their faith- it was a regular part of their daily life.  The writing style was very simple and that made the characters seem very simple also.  At times I felt that I was reading someone's *idea* of what the people were like, rather than what they were *really* like.<br />Mama's many pregnancies and births were lightly glossed over, so anyone looking for insight into that would find it lacking.  Their ideas on why the children looked like they do would have been comical if the parents hadn't taken them so seriously.  Some children were more &quot;fleshed out&quot; than others and there was absolutely no explanation given for the source of their nicknames.  Beating, switching and hitting the children were taken for granted, and I am very happy that it is now illegal to hit children in Scandinavian countries.  Even the children knew the switchings didnt' help their behaviour but the parents didnt' figure that out.<br />Food and housework were mentioned more often than just about anything else.  Maria (Mama) was obviously Supermom to maintain her immaculate house and to bake and cook regularly for the family.  They didnt' do laundry except in the summer so maybe that's how she kept up.<br />References to the yard mystified me a little.  A more thorough description would have helped as I still dont' understand the sand yard.<br />The sea voyages to America were hardly mentioned.  I would have loved to know more about how they really felt and how they lived day-to-day on the ships.  I would have liked to have &quot;met&quot; some of their fellow travellers- after all, my Grandparents could have been on the same ship as they were.<br />If you view this as a light book about a girl who gets her (older) man, lives the life of her dreams as a Preacher's Wife who gets to emigrate to America, then you will be satisfied.  If you're looking for insight on early 20th Century Swedish life, look further.ve loved to know more about how they really felt and how they lived day-to-day on the ships.

Tedd Arnold explores a different scary aspect of bedjumping, probably one that many children who live in old houses or buildings have thought about- What If The Floor Breaks?! In addition, he caters to the voyeur in children. Don't most children wonder what their neighbors do and what their homes are like? Mine do. The illustrations are charmingly blocky- like Lego people. The animals are cuddly. Everyone rhymes. The theme is very funny to little people- Imagine visiting all your neighbors through the floor! Walter is viewed in our household much as an actor is- my children have noticed that he is also Ollie in \\"Ollie Forgot\\". We like that continuity of players in our books. I know that children have to learn that dreams aren't reality; that \\"what happens during the night\\" is not really something that happens. Interestingly, Tedd Arnold messes with young minds just a little by making them wonder what is reality and what is a dream.	2001-08-25

Frequently I felt that the author had observed a few interactions with midwives in Malaysia, read accounts of traditions elsehwere, and tried to put it together as a comprehensive account of birthing.  She tried to speak with more authority than I believe she had.<br />An astute reader might be able to get some tips from this book on how to visualise an easier birth- thinking of openness when seeing a doorway and window might indeed help a woman open faster for a birth.  Undoing knots might help her concentrate on opening her mind and cervix for her birth. But most of the other traditions weren't explored in any detail.  Far too many were left at one person's explanation of a tradition or &quot;treatment&quot; but the author made no attempt to delve into the original reasons these were thought to have worked.<br />The segue from the cross cultural discussion to modern, Western birthing protocols were abrupt and contrived.  The author appeared to want to discuss the flaws of Western hospital birthing, wanted to present the alternatives as done throughout history, but the transitions were not well done.  I agree that there are many problems in Western birthing protocols and attitudes, but I don't think the comparisons drawn here were the most effective ways to do that.<br />I highly recommend Diana Korte's &quot;A Good Birth, A Safe Birth&quot; for a good, critical look at hospital birthing and the hazards inherent in our medical model of birth.	2001-08-10

It was spotty in parts, and I frequently wondered if early 90's British teens and early 20's talked and thought like that, but the finish was so well-rounded, so unexpected that I am left with a wonderful taste in my mouth.<br />The going is slow initially- I was reminded of D.H. Lawrence's &quot;Women in Love&quot; because I just *didn't like those people*.  I really didn't.  I couldn't stand Joan, didn't like Bellamy, thought Harvey was vapid, and the Cliftonians unreal.  I stuck around long enough to get to know them, and changed my attitude about some of them.  I even became so involved that I was cheered by some of the mistakes being made right- especially when it came to the dog.  I wanted to help correct things, and to influence people.<br />At times, I wondered who the novel was about.  Was it Peter?  Kind of- Peter transformed people, or so we assumed.  (but did he?)  Maybe it was the Cliftonians because they featured prominently?  No, overall, events happened to them, but they didn't cause them.  I thought for awhile that it was about Lucas, and in a way it was.  Lucas was quite a force for &quot;the family&quot;, even though he was so rarely present.  The novel even starts with his absence.  But how could a novel be about an absent person?  It doesn't matter though- it is about any of them and all of them.  The marriages may have been a contrivance, but they were nice, some made sense, and others leave us with a lot to wonder about.<br />Iris Murdoch is a wonderful writer, and weaves a beautiful web with unexpected moments.  Even when I forget the action of a novel, I remember the feeling she left me with.	2001-08-01

Gabrielle Palmer covers all the bases on why we need to protect future generations from the mass marketing of infant formula, and how those products have become so prevalent throughout our society and the world.

Background on the World Health Organisation's stance on the marketing of breastmilk substitutes made me realise what an all-encompassing public health issue breastfeeding is.	2001-07-31

I think everyone, adults and children, need to know more about the absolute joy and safety of birthing at home.  My 2 children who attended their baby brother's birth now accept homebirth as normal, not just for people who &quot;don't like hospitals&quot;.<br />On the other hand, I was disappointed that the family portrayed wasn't just a regular, ordinary family.  They were removed from the life that most of us live- they heated only with wood, and lighted their home with candles.  Few of us do that.  Most of us have central heat and lights, a water heater and a gas stove.  We drive to our midwife's prenatal appointments in our cars purchased a Any Dealer USA.  We aren't &quot;back to nature&quot; people.  I fear that this book portrays a homebirthing family as out of the ordinary.  As long as we view it that way, Boulder's 12% homebirthing rate will be *exceedingly* rare, and 99% of US births will continue to be in hospitals.  That is a shame.	2001-04-05

It will be somewhat useful for my proposed short trip this summer, particularly since my partner will be involved in academic issues and a conference during our trip. I suspect there is a better book to prepare for a short visit, but I haven't found it yet.<br />Some parts of the Swedish character as portrayed ring *very true*, especially the idea that they have the best way figured out. I've seen that my whole life with my relatives who are first generation American from Sweden, and it even persists into the second generation. (but maybe that's me too! :-) )<br />The writing style strikes me as being written for a simpleton. I can't figure out why, since the vocabulary is not excessively limited. The reading level may be lower than that to which I am accustomed, but I'm not even sure if that's it. Maybe the author is out of practice with English, and she is from Britain, making the style seem stilted to my US ear?  I read a lot, so that doesn't seem possible either....<br />It is, none-the-less, a worthwhile read and is inspiring me to get going on the rest of my Sweden research!	2001-04-04

Everytime we went to the store that carried it, I browsed patterns and fabric, she lusted over this book.  Finally, I just had to give in to her before someone else bought &quot;her&quot; book.  :-)<br />We haven't been disappointed.  The illustrations are very clear, and very much to scale.  I love having clothing patterns for the dolls available- they're worthwhile even if you never make one of the dolls.  The clear directions make it almost easy to make a face that actually looks like a face.  The supplies lists are very straightforward and doesn't include anything you can't easily pick up at your local craft supply stores.<br />I highly recommend this book, even for children.  A 6 yo is a little young to be able to carry out the project on her own, but working together with an adult is very possible.	2001-01-16

The crazy woman with the many personalities, the man who risked his life, career and um, well, potency on a dare from a prostitute, the &quot;oar&quot; in the boat, the &quot;journalist&quot; and that odd little bat.

My daughter has read this book with me several times and still laughs out loud at Gloria's antics, especially in the first &quot;thumbtack&quot;  scene.

We love Gloria, and we love the message of &quot;never turn  your back on your buddy.&quot;  I've found this book to be a good starting  point for talking about friendship and the intentions of our friends.  Officer Buckle was very hurt and offended when he learned what Gloria did  during his talks (a classic hang-dog look in that scene), but he learns  that she didn't intend to hurt him and actually helps and enhances his  work.  Who doesn't feel misunderstood at some point?  Clearly Gloria was,  and happily her buddy realised that.  What more could we ask for?  (other  than another equally good book with Gloria?)	2000-09-08

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good basic How-to Manual	This is a very brief little manual written by a very knowledgable IBCLC  (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant).  The intended  audience seems to be WIC clients, but also should be good for people who  don't like to read much or they don't read very well.  (this book is  available in Spanish too.)  Pamela Wiggins covers the basics:  why  breastfeed, how to latch on and hold the baby properly, how to avoid  pitfalls many women encounter because of our bottlefeeding culture and how  to fix simple breastfeeding problems.<br />To my mind there is a strong  emphasis on &quot;the doctor&quot; but that may be fine for a lot of  people.  If that isn't your mindset, further reading may be necessary, or  make certain you have a good breastfeeding friendly doctor, a good WIC  counselor or lactation consultant and a good support network.  &quot;Breastfeeding, A Mother's Gift&quot; by the same author fills in this  little book with much more information.<br />I agree with the other reviewer  that this is an excellent choice for midwives, childbirth educators, peer  counselors, physicians and others who work with new mothers and babies to  hand out to their clients.	2000-08-09

The authors, not big authorities in their fields, are condescending of women, husbands,  midwives, doula, and even the ability of an infant to communicate their  needs to their responsive parents.<br />If you want to trust your body to  give birth, read anything by Penny Simkin or Sheila Kitzenger.  The Sears  books tell you much more about what to expect from babyhood and how to  realistically cope with it.<br />The only thing these women write well  about is their information on breastfeeding premmies.  Unfortunately they  don't support breastfeeding in the rest of their books.  If you follow the  advice of most obs and postpartum nurses, as they would like you to, you  may have many unnecessary problems breastfeeding.  If you follow their  advice, you'll give bottles earlier than most knowledgeable board certified  lactation consultants recommend, you'll potentially decrease your milk  supply and you will prematurely wean (defined as anytime before 1 year).<br />I don't really want to bash these authors, but rather educate gift  buyers that they may be doing their loved ones a disservice by falling back  on these books.  Besides, their ob (who wants complete compliance from  their patients) will give them a copy.  Didn't yours?

In this case, the stay-at-home mama gets a job, classically over the objections of Papa.  The children, excuse me,  cubs, express their concerns about this major change and mama tells them  how she hopes to cope.  Cope they do, and Mama is very happy with her  decision to open a quilting shop.<br />The amusing part is that Mama gets a  lot of quilting done as she prepares to open her shop!  How does she do it?  Most of us find it tough to parent two children and sew, let alone finish  a half dozen quilts at the same time as we clean up a shop and organise a  business.<br />The small flaws of this book, as with the rest of the  Berenstain Bears books, don't discourage my daughters, and don't detract  from the main thrust of the discussion.

Mama comes to the rescue with some much needed common sense and moderation.  The book concludes with a plausible example of Brother maybe trusting a  stranger too much.<br />A good starting point for working with young, very  trusting children, on appropriate interpersonal interactions, and may help  prevent the child from fearing even the grocery store clerk.	2000-06-27

The overall message is good: people who want everything will never be satisfied.  The main underlying message  is good too: parents get *awfully* annoyed at being nagged for goodies.  The plan the parents implement with the help of the grandbears, and the  enthusiasm of the cubs works well for them.  A similar version works well  for my family too.<br />My only objection is the &quot;superiority&quot; the  cubs seem to feel and don't hesitate to express about other &quot;greedy  cubs&quot; after they have learned some control over their own greed.  They  parrot the parents when they see a cub throwing a tantrum and discuss how  &quot;embarrassing and awful&quot; that behaviour is.  Too bad.  I'd rather  see the cubs feel empathy for another, to understand how very similar they  are to the others, even if they are currently displaying exemplary  behaviour.	2000-06-27

This book is almost as old as me, and I remember loving it when I was very young.  It has elements to inspire any child: empathy with animals, mind reading, fantastically athletic feats, a peaceful alternative to a nasty  world- and escape from dangerous, meddling people.  I re-read it today and  was very pleased to find it as good as I thought it was when I was 7 or 8.<br />At least one aspect of the child that seemed very odd to the almost  mainstream family as portrayed in 1965 have fortunately changed for the  better. Jon is vegetarian and this was cause for great puzzlement.  I  remember scratching my head over that, &quot;but what does he eat?&quot;,  but to many children now it's much more normal, and accepted.  My  Scholastic edition has the press postulate that Jon is from Mars, so we can  get a small glimpse of how far we've come in our attitudes toward the  habitability of our solar system.<br />I wanted to read *more* of these people  as a child, and I had the same feeling again today.  I highly recommend  this book.	2000-06-27

I have never had the impression  they push any method of health care over any other, but rather want the  parent to have all the options.  Read the introductory sections on all of  the modalities they offer so you fully understand the rationale behind  them.  Read the home safety tips too; most are pretty obvious to parents,  but there may be something you overlook; don't we all?<br />I'm lucky to have  very healthy children so I don't need the specifics a lot, but this book is  well written enough just to have on hand and read out of curiousity such as  when the neighbor's child has roseola or just to tell your child what it  really looks like when someone breaks a bone.	2000-05-19

I wonder what she was trying to accomplish by her repackaged book? Maybe she was trying to reach more people- the ones who refuse to feel guilty because they are not willing to do right by their baby and give the food  all babies deserve. It's sad a book like this even sells, because in  millenia passed, everyone knew that babies nurse at the breast, bodies  aren't merely sexual, babies deserve their biological norm (mother's milk)  and our society might not be so geared toward the nanny crowd. (see some of  PR's other titles.) It's very unfortunate that Peggy &quot;I Own my Own  Press&quot; Robin had such poor advice on how to continue breastfeeding  because now she is busy lashing out at some of the very people who can help  babies get the breastmilk they deserve.  I'm no cultist- I'm a  physiologist who recognises normalcy when she sees it and an inferior  product when she sees that. Breastmilk is normal, formula is an inferior  choice. Mothers to be, if you feel hesitant about breastfeeding, read  &quot;So that's What they're For! Breastfeeding Basics&quot; by Janet  Tomaro. She'll give you real information- not the results of spying on  people who justify her hostility, as Peggy Robin does.  Watching women  breastfeed can help, and making sure your partner supports you makes the  initial weeks easier.  If you have problems, call a IBCLC- International  Board Certified Lactation Consultant 1-800- TELL YOU.  No book can solve  all problems!  Find a qualified person, or a few!<br />  I don't think anyone  disparages women who adopt and are given no information on induced  lactation, but I would like to see a positive attitude toward the human  body and the development of human milk banks. Peggy certainly isn't helping  that issue either.  If a parent-to-be visits a pediatrician who does not  actively advocate breastfeeding, she needs to get a copy of the American  Academy of Pediatrics Statement on the Use of Human Milk to that physician.  Peggy is not on your side in ensuring optimal health for you child. Oh, and  yes, those of us with breastfed children do see physicians.

I was tired of the unloved child viewpoint, sad as it was, so I switched to thinking of the novel as an historical perspective.  In that, it is very worthwhile.  I  have read little of that period of Chinese history from the perspective of  one living through it.<br />The political dynamics of the time were  interesting and the effects on lives, heartbreaking.

She enjoyed nursing and wrote a simple, accessible book for working women.  The basics are laid out; some women like more information, but for a lot, this is really all they need.  She delineates the differences between breastfeeding as food as  breastfeeding as nurturing, and why that can be a necessity for working  mothers.  Her discussion of reverse cycle nursing and nighttime nursing is  essential to success as well.<br />The chapter on working with your physician  is very insightful.  The author, a physician herself, clearly states that  pediatricians learn medicine, not childrearing, (starting solids, sleeping,  even breastfeeding.)  She tells of being asked for childrearing advice as  an intern and where she got it- nurses, parents, other physicians.  They  dont' teach that in medical school, yet many Americans assume their doctor  knows everything about babies and children.<br />I would like to have seen  less emphasis on discreet nursing and &quot;how to find a private place to  nurse while out with the baby.&quot;  Recent studies (JHL April, 2000) once  again demonstrate that the more familiar people are with breastfeeding, the  more likely they are to breastfeed their own child.  To her credit, she did  state that when she nursed in public, most people were involved with their  own activities and didn't heed hers.  I have found this to be true as well.<br />A very good, basic book.  Even more impressive because the author had  to be talked into have children by her husband.	2000-05-06

I felt alone and lonely at the conclusion, when I had hoped that instead,Ginny would be making strides toward her real self.  Don't we all want that to  happen to people we like?<br />I enjoy well written, highly detailed  narratives- this certainly was one.  I read this more than a month ago, but  have a strong image of the characters and their actions- how they moved,  and sometimes even why.<br />I found some of the reviews amusing.  I didn't  think much about King Lear as I read this, but I didn't read them back to  back.  I did find very disturbing the scenes of incest.  Incest happens,  it's awful and denying it (as a culture) isn't going to make it go away.  Denying it as individuals is how children survive the experience and grow  to adulthood; I just wish there were some way of purging predatory  behaviour.  On the subject of sexual fantasies;  they're part of life and  have never hurt anyone.  So what if Ginny empathised with a sow?  She lived  with them, and worked with them.<br />Once again, Jane Smiley brought to  life the pettiness of small towns and small churches.  They can sound so  inviting but can make life miserable when the community turns it's back on  a person or family.  In many ways, this story didn't have to be the tragedy  it was.  Community and family support could have turned it all around.  But  what good is literature if it doesn't make us think and feel?  Even if we  are feeling the darkness in other people.	2000-05-06

She is even smart enough to put on a disguise to get in where she isn't  allowed, but slips up because she can't resist a flying frisbee.  Everything she ends up telling the other hotel guests after her exiled  doggieness is discovered is very true- we say we love our dogs yet so many  people disallow them basic &quot;dog rights&quot;.  When given a chance,  most dogs can behave appropriately in public, and as Martha says, they need  to be given that in exchange for what they've done for us.

She left professional school to be at home with her children and write.  (If she didn't respond to some personal email, it likely is  because she just hasn't had time yet.)  I've enjoyed reading Katie's  writing for years now- do a search on the web for her essays- and this book  is no exception.  I didn't really learn much from it, since I've read all  this elsewhere- but for someone who is adrift in the sea of mainstream  parenting, and harsh criticism for your choices, this is an essential  manual.  It might even convince someone that they can parent well in spite  of being badly parented themselves- Katie will help you understand what you  need to do to tune into your baby and not follow blindly what  &quot;everyone else&quot; is doing.  She tells you why you should  breastfeed, consider sleeping with your child (in spite of the *consumer  products* safety commission), how to share sleep safely, why you shouldn't  give a &quot;relief&quot; bottle (sic), and how you might be feeling with a  new wonderful addition to your life.  As to parenting multiples- Katie  hasn't had twins- most of us haven't.  All twins are different, and parents  really have to rely on their instincts and like-minded parents of  multiples.  Search them out- they are out there!  And I hope you gain  enough confidence in parenting to learn to parent instinctively with twins.	1999-12-31

This book, OTOH, is great: accurate, and very approachable.  Most breastfeeding mothers won't need this book, and it is quite pricy, but  if you work with mothers and babies in any capacity, it's a great book to  have.  (most mothers could use &quot;So That's What they're For!  Breastfeeding Basics&quot; or &quot;The Nursing Mother's Companion&quot;,  or &quot;The Womanly Art...&quot;)  Information in this book is very  straight-forward, easy to understand, very thorough and very easy to find.

The wolves are very creative, and portrayed much as wolves really are; pack animals just trying to live their lives in their nice house(s).  The pig, well, pigs really can  be quite brutal, and *would* go after peace-loving wolves.  Fortunately,  the wolves inadvertently discover how to appeal to the lighter side of the  pig and make peace.  The other animal characters are very well drawn and I  especially like the &quot;kind-hearted rhino&quot;.  There are nice plays  on words that I missed on the first readings, and the illustrations are  appealing.

This isn't for the average &quot;consumer&quot; of breastfeeding and parenting books- it won't give much practical advice.  What it does is provide accurate, researched based information on what is currently known  as &quot;attachment parenting&quot;.  I was led to &quot;ap&quot; by an  endocrinology professor, ten years before I had children, and I learned  from her that parenting can be interesting and fulfilling.  I learned that  there are parenting instincts- holding a baby, sleeping with the baby, not  letting the baby cry... the various authors in this book reinforce that.  I  came away from these writings with a sense that mothering is important and  has been throughout history, and that *children* are important.  Sometimes  I feel that gets lost in parenting books, especially the  &quot;mainstream&quot; of Dobson, What to Expect, Ezzo...  Dettwyler, et.  al. show us that our children deserve better than that.<br />I might even  study anthropology someday.  :-)	1999-12-31

He admits to children the scary aspects of polar bears- they eat stinky food, they're really big, their mothers (and fathers) treat the cubs harshly, but  Larry ends up as a likable character anyway.  Anyone who asks his brother  &quot;so, do you think we can fend?&quot; has a pretty good sense of  himself.  When Larry arrives in New Jersey (!) he quickly learns from  &quot;A Human&quot; what it takes to get what he wants in this new and  exciting culture.  He settles down to do what needs to be done- earn money  to buy muffins. No one seems to think twice about his outer bearsona for  some time.  Somehow, Daniel Pinkwater pulls that off, and my daughters have  never questioned it.<br />This wasn't the first &quot;Larry&quot; book we  owned, but I think it is the most charming of them.  They all do have their  charms and phrases that stay with you, and my daughters like them all.

Hermoine's solution to  her vast ambition was very nice- very creative on the part of her teachers.  I especially enjoyed her overworked, overtired reaction to the Divination  teacher- I suspect mine would be similar.  Harry also solves a mystery that  appeared in the first book- I wondered what the purpose of Ron's rat was,  and now we know.

Breastfeeding is one word, lots of two year olds breastfeed, and some do it a lot, some of their older  siblings are still nurslings too, and thousands of women take Prozac or  other SSRI's while nursing- see Tom Hale's &quot;Medications in Mother's  Milk&quot; to see which is best (Prozac isn't it, but he still doesn't nix  nursing for Prozac using moms.)<br />OK- that picks nits, or fur, whichever  you prefer.  :-O  The introduction of Kimi was wonderful in this  installment, and the characters were well drawn, as usual.  The plot was  nice, and even though the villan was easily pegged, there were some nice  twists and turns along the way to the final conclusion, if there was such a  conclusion.  I appreciate that Holly speaks the language of dogs; that was  a nice touch.<br />Every time I read one of her mysteries, I wonder if my  Siberian/Samoyd mix is still young enough to get her C.D. and I think about  the day I can get another Alaskan Malemute and work on his (or her) C.D.

I would love to hear what the authors have to say about women and children in the past 20 years, altough it isn't too hard to figure it out.<br />The chapters directly on women as healers were  very inspiring- makes me want to make sure I only give birth with direct  entry or lay midwives.  I find it heartbreaking that so many people, and  especially women, suffered so much at the hands of &quot;medical  doctors&quot; in past centuries.  So many women healers suffered because of  the arrogance of the untrained, unseeing men who shouldered their way into  the healing professions.  So many women and babies suffered when the  &quot;experts&quot; told them how to raise their babies, and we continue to  see that today in the voices of James Dobson and Gary Ezzo.  Mistrust any  &quot;expert&quot; who doesn't give the tools to cope on your own or who  insists they know more than the woman who is there day in and day out.  Mistrust anyone who wants to train your child to be a follower of these  &quot;leaders&quot; 9or their standby, the right wing Christian  interpretation of God) instead of learning to be themselves.  Once it was  the marketplace they were trained for, now it is service to God, but all of  the techniques are similar.<br />Fortunately there have always been women who  were willing to NOT conform and to speak their minds and to change the  prevailing view.  Thank the heavens for them.  We still need them.	1999-06-10

It wasn't just set in the early 70's- it *was* that time.  The time of communes, early gay rights, women's rights- we have so much to  thank those people for.  For not accepting rape as &quot;just one of those  things men do&quot;.  For being able to love who we wanted, for saying what  we mean.  Marge Piercy explores some of the issues that &quot;Vida&quot;  explored in greater detail; being on the run, set ups for the charge of  conspiracy, supporting people who believe as you in spite of never having  met them before.  *sigh* what an idealistic time.  And they needed that  idealism to change all that needed changing.  By the time I was a college  student, we didn't call them communes, they were co-ops.  Gardening was  just gardening and women were no longer asked personal questions in job  interviews anymore- ok, not often.  I really appreciate the thoughts and  work that went before us.  The cat is, btw, a character throughout the  book, as cats ought to be in a Marge Piercy novel.  And remember, if a  character doesn't like cats, you won't like that character, or you  shouldn't.  :-)	1998-12-31

We meet Susan as a young lady in a small, closed minded town in the &quot;Western&quot; state of Ohio, just past the  turn of the century.  (the last century.)  She believes a young man that he  has fallen in love with her and will run away with her to marry. This was  viewed as a terrible scandal by the petty members of the community,  &quot;forcing&quot; her guardians to find a farmer for her to marry; a  dreadful creature.  This is the beginning of her fall, and she falls and  falls for some number of years following.  She ecapes to a city- was in New  York? and makes her way as a well brought up young woman forced to do so in  a man's world.  Men were essential to women for their livlihood, and a  woman without reputation and introduction were cast adrift with dreadful  housing, horrible food, terrible job prospects, if they can even be called  a job.  The gap between rich and poor was tremendous even then, and  literally pennies were all that were needed to improve the lot of the  &quot;working poor&quot;, just as is the case now.  The lot of the workers  was easily improved, and it was tragic to see how callous the manufacturers  were to the needs of their laborors.<br />Susan, luckily, &quot;rises&quot;  but has a talent and ability to develop it that so few have.  That she had  the opportunity at all was mere chance.	1998-12-21

I have no idea if it was accurate, and the &quot;convenient abrupt ending&quot; another reviewer alluded to I found to  make perfect sense with the flow of the rest of the novel.  Throughout  there was a sense that *something* was going occur and it was going to be  very important, and well, finally it did.  I didn't like the characters  themselves a lot either, with the exception of Axel, but only when reading  &quot;Women in Love&quot; by DH Lawrence, has that really mattered to me.  I found the characters interesting and on the edge of transformation.  What  I really did wonder about through out was why Henry wasn't riding, but  maybe he didn't know, and neither did anyone else, so why should we?  My  major objection to the edition I had was the cover.  The farm in the book  is a horse farm; the farmm on the cover was a crop farm.	1998-12-04

If you follow the Christian (but not scriptural) based ideas of this book, you may see a FTT baby- one who has learned that no matter what s/he signals, her needs will rarely be met.  This applies to feeding, sleep, cuddling, being carried, being talked to.  (Ezzo says we aren't primitive people so our babies don't need a lot of holding or sling/snuggly use.) They also claim there is no &quot;maternal instinct&quot; but they do all they can to obscure the instinct we mothers know we have.  The baby is viewed as a minor inconvenience but a &quot;joy&quot;, (how, they don't explore) whereas the parents are the only truly important family members.  This is the secular version of &quot;Preparation for Parenting&quot; a Christian program, repudiated by many churches.  It doesn't work, and although Ezzo likes to think so, J! esus wasn't raised this way.  Oh, it appears to work, if you want a baby who sleeps, plays and eats on cue, but is unable to determine his or her own bodily needs.  Read the Sears new Christian parenting book instead, or any of their books if you aren't Christian, or Penelope Leach.  (The religious affiliation is not revealed in Becoming Baby(un)wise.)  There are too many good books to waste your money on this one.  Bucknum often doesn't recommend this method to his patients- maybe he knows something he won't admit in print.  :-/	1998-07-24

She discusses *why* you should breastfeed, or at least &quot;try it&quot; even if you think it's &quot;not for you&quot;  (it doesn't have to be; it's for  your baby), and how and why to avoid situations that can cause breastfeeding problems such as drugs in delivery, bottles by the nurses, infant/mother separation.  Maybe it will make some people realise that those of us who advocate those things aren't martyrs, but are realists.  Proper latch-on and positioning are well explained, as are the realities of living with a tiny newborn.  (Scary sometimes for first time moms, but it doesnt' have to be.)  &quot;So that's what they're for&quot; should be available in every bookstore instead of dry, condenscending books such as the &quot;what to expect&quot; series.  Read this and you won't need the any other books on early babyhood because you'll be well on your way to being tuned into your baby and your body.  It's a pretty fast read but good for a second or third trip through.	1998-04-14

Why would I do it?  Well, the same reason as the author did; historical, architectural, for the connection with the past.  In the Middle Ages, it seemed that pilgrimages were a great excuse to travel and there still is a culture of the pilgrim that exists on the pigrim road.  When I travel to Spain I will most assuredly travel a part of the Pilgrims Road.  I won't get to see as much as Jack Hitt did but I hope I will see enough to recall his ironic humor.

Sandy's mother was manic-depressive, and it seems that the saving grace for him was her periods of mania during which she showered him with love.  During depressive periods, and because of her brother's suicide at the time of Sandy's birth, the mother believed that children are independant creatures who do not need the love and nurturing of their mother.  She, therefore, left him alone to play for many periods of time, taught him to not explore on his own with food and toys and gave him limited cuddling and loving.  He was very lucky that he had the love of his &quot;grandparents&quot; and their perserverence to do right by him.  They were influenced by the times in that they felt a nanny was necessary, but Sandy fared well in spite of that.  Attachment disorder research was in it's infancy then (50's) but maybe because it happened so rarely?  After all, everyone *knew* that babies need loving and holding, and there were no &quot;experts&quot; telling them that babies need to &quot;learn to be independent&quot;.  Try to ignore the racist and uninformed comments about Down's Syndrome and remember that the author was a product of her times.  I suspect she would be a very different person were she writing today.  I would love to hear how Sandy has fared as an adult.	1998-03-05

(I suspect he may have been  the son of a different father or an unwanted child)  Why didn't his brother's suffer (but of course they did, anyone living around that abuse suffers)  As for why the teachers didn't do anything: well, someone called Child Protective Services, and called his mother but the system didn't help.  That's the way it was in the 1970's.  I know this from personal experience.  I, too, was abused.  I called the police.  They came, they did nothing.  The neighbors certainly saw and heard a lot, as did random passers-by watching my father *beat* (or whip) me with a belt alongside a highway.  They saw him smash his fist into my mother's face. Teachers saw my tattered clothing and my mother's bruises.  A Sunday School superintendent talked to me about stealing change from other children's coats.  Ministers and teachers saw me in tears, run sobbing and panicked from classrooms and church.  Shopkeepers caught me stealing food and underwear.  I prayed that someone would intervene and thought of doing something on my own behalf, but the one experience of calling the police convinced me that it wouldn't do any good.  How did I survive?  Occasional breaks, the love of my grandmother and the knowledge that someday I would grow up and go to college.  It doesn't happen overnight, but it happens from within.	1998-03-05

It is very much geared toward German readers but is very applicable to the rest of the world as well, especially those of us in the US.<br /><br />Alice Miller explores the roots of violence as the violence imparted to children, and who were not allowed to express the pain and suffering caused by the violence.  She covers in great detail the child-rearing methods prevalent in Germany from the 1700's thru this century; and of course there are many parallels to the &quot;methods&quot; advocated in the US then and to this day.  The explicit, stated reason of these methods was to break the will of the child, beginning with infancy.  Yes, infancy.  And how was that done?  By depriving children of thier voice, their joy, their anger, sadness, the ability to listen to their body's cues such as hunger.  She really drives home the way that the cycle of violence in families is perpetrated, and why it is so very important to break the chain.  I will never again hesitate to empathise with a child who is being 'swatted' or otherwise humiliated by a parent.  Children need to know that their emotions are valid, and we have an obligation to allow them to express these emotions.<br /><br /> If you have any doubt that children are being deprived of their voice, read &quot;On Becoming Babywise&quot; by Ezzo and Bucknam.  They begin at infancy by scheduling feeds for children and telling the parents to decide when playtime is.  They do not respond to the cries of their children.  They are also responsible for an overtly Christian (sort of) parenting method entitled &quot;Preparation for Parenting&quot;.  No disputes with the mentors are allowed in these programs, which is exactly what the parents are to be passing on to their children.  As far as beating children, 20% of Coloradans recently surveyed said that is is fine for parents to beat their children with a wooden spoon.  Focus on the Family actively advocates such beatings as a method of &quot;discipline&quot;.  Sadly, violence against children is still occurring around us.cus on the Family actively advocates such beatings as a method of &quot;discipline&quot;.

Find out what most of womankind throughout history has known about support in labor, and why you should rely on someone other than just your partner.  He has a different role, learn what the role of a doula is	1997-04-09

The authors- a couple of RN's, so no, they aren't physicians- seem to assume that you will treat your mainstream obstetrician or midwife as a god and final authority.  If that's what you want, fine.  If you want a safe, empowering birth, and a good outcome, look for information elsewhere.  Try &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Wm and Martha Sears, &quot;A Good Birth, A Safe Birth&quot;... and by all means, avoid the rest of the books in the WTE series- most are worse than this one.<br /><br />I found that I was nauseated by reading the book by about the 5th month the first time around, and it was relegated to bathroom reading the second time around.	1997-04-09

I loved this book and would give it toabsolutely everyone who is expecting a baby, or has one.  I would give it to total strangers if I could afford it!  The Sears learned through experience and allowed their children to teach them how to lovingly parent, guide development and teach self discipline.  This book reinforced every thing I learned about babies and caring for them in endocrinology classes, and had the realistic information needed when I actually became a parent.	1997-04-09

The more I thought about it, the more inspired I was by her.  I couldn't birth alone; that's just not my style, but it convinced me that birth is natural, the pain (if it is there) is there for a reason.  I decided to embrace the pain of labor and to facilitate it in that way- and I did, for 2.5 days.  Now I'm pregnant with my second and draw upon that experience again as birth approaches-  I'm hoping to be in her second proposed book on birthing without pain, and with actual pleasure instead.  Laura is well versed in birth issues, which I believe came after at least one of her births	1997-04-09

After reading this book, anyone will become a staunch breastfeeding advocate and will cringe to see a bottle in a baby's mouth, diaper bag, or a formula ad appearing anywhere.  I love the information on how respectfully women are treated around the world, expected to nurse and nurture their babies- and then contrast that with how poorly the US society treats women. still!  Six weeks isnt' long enough for moms and new babies and Dia points out the wonderful ways that the rest of the industrialised world copes with the reality of nurturing the next generation	1997-04-09

Why and how you should breastfeed	I read this while nursing my two year old and still found it to be inspirational.  Discusses why breastfeeding is best- 'way beyond the formula company's required pablum- and the very real risks of denying a child breastmilk and giving formula.  Discusses the history of feeding infants, the history of weight charts for assessing growth, and the pitfalls that hospitals often inflict on mothers who intend to breastfeed.  Gives great insight into such created feeding problems as &quot;insufficient milk syndrome&quot; and points out that most of those cases are due to inadequate letdown.  And points out how to get beyond such nightmares.  I really loved this book and was sad when I finished	1997-04-08
