Evan Cooper's \\"Um, like...OM, A Girl Goddess's Guide to Yoga\\" is a breezy read which accomplishes what all good teachers do best: Imparting with vivid good humor the wisdoms of processes taken beyond the classroom.  The target audience here, primarily middle-school girls, calls for a most delicate balancing act: Being bright, fun, and \\"cool\\" while explaining the theory, practice, and results of a disciplined approach to yoga.  Ms. Cooper accomplishes this masterfully with anecdotes, explanations, and her \\"girl friend\\" persona.    Scan the table of contents alone and, guaranteed: You're hooked: weight, sex, drugs, peers, parents, and so much else.  Add Stacy Peterson's fun, carefully-scripted (by position and motion) illustrations of the exercises, and this fun profound little book will delight and please any \\"tweener-to-teen.\\"   And her mom, who might recover her own \\"pocket devi\\" in the process!	2005-04-27

To that end, I had devised a number of sentences and a paragraphs which, as Ms. Truss demonstrates, could mean radically different things depending on a comma here, a semi-colon there, and an occasional errant or missing apostrophe.  <br />Ms. Truss is to be commended for bringing the importance of exactitude in this seemingly &quot;easy&quot; task of knowing and using even minimal punctuation correctly.   In this regard, her fun and erudite little book feels much like John Rigden's elegant treatise of a few years back, &quot;Hydrogen: The Essential Element&quot; in which he demonstrates the depth and breadth of knowledge this simplest of elements has bequeathed to us. <br />Yet even physicist Rigden requires Ms. Truss's prosaic usages as the alpha point in his revelatory hymn to and of hydrogen!  Thank you, Ms. Truss, for lighting this cautionary flare against sloppiness in the cyber-era when the printed text matters even more than it ever has. Indeed, Harold Ramos' Igor in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had it wrong twenty years ago:  The printed word is NOT dead. Neither is the need for the humble comma, well-placed.	2004-06-06

Bush	Books	4	20	27	N	N	Be aware as rhetoric collides with reality	Peter Singer?s ?The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush? is an unabashedly anti-Bush polemic, the unavoidable consequence of Mr. Singer?s intellectual truth-telling regarding the many dichotomies apparent in Bush?s governance to date.  Mr. Singer brings his philosopher?s acumen and tools to this examination of Bush?s impact, both at home and abroad.   <br />The fact is that, across the policy board, Bush?s persona as a squeaky-clean defender of  ?good? in the face of  ?evil? actually conceals a far darker Hobbesian world view, one made murkier yet by discordant and often-conflicting ethics at the core.  A simplest case in point regarding the ?reverence for life? in loudly pro-life Bush:  his enthusiastic adoption of capital punishment even though its value as a crime deterrent has been refuted for decades.   On and on the conflicts tumble out in this calm, reasoned telling of the actions and the rhetoric.  <br />The tragedy is that these are not Bush?s ideas and attitudes at all, but rather the many neoconservative and ?Straussian? handlers who have funded and empowered Bush to their radical far-right agenda.  Mose revealing is  the neoconservative sourcing for their arrogance:  Leo Strauss, whose  mid-twentieth century philosophical  views state that ?there is one kind of truth for the masses, and another for the philosophers -- that is , for those in the know.?  Curiously, for this overtly Christian president who frowns at spoken ?damns? in cabinet meetings, the Straussian truth is that ?the existence of God is, at best, unprovable in any rational, scientific view of the world.  But this truth should not be revealed to the masses, because religion breeds deference to the ruling classes?.?  Odd that it sounds like an exact echo of the old Marxist saw about ?religion being the opiate of the masses.?<br />Presumably, few Bush supporters would care to look too carefully at the hodge-podge of morality that  finally does equate to the sort of moralrelativism that Bush says is our nation?s modern bane.  Mr. Singer?s rational dissection of Bush?s rhetoric and ?Christian heart? should be on the national required reading list.	2004-05-28

In this regard, Brown's book has that added content layering of a quality tour replete with historical and cultural tidbits imbedded along the way.  The most innovative inclusion in this particular narrative is Brown's use of GPS locaters, broadband connectivity, and cell phones - all of which, when one thinks of it, would have undone many of the great mysteries of our lives, both real and fictional.<br />As for the overwrought defenders of the orthodox church, they must be reminded that this is, after all, a work of fiction, a mystery.  Period.<br />Overall, a thoughtful and instructive adventure, a three-word combo rarely appearing together.	2004-05-13

Chet Raymo's \\"The Dork of Cork\\" follows the night sky ruminations and meanderings of Frank Bois, diminutive bastard son of Bernadette Bois, an ambiguously sympathetic character whom you`ll either love to hate or hate to love.  She is of a most rare beauty and a rarer-yet ethos and morality, particularly where she and her dwarf son have ended up: in manically-embattled Christian Ireland (and briefly in the dusty Bible Belt of America.)  <br />Trapped in his absurd dwarfism and his mother's life of amoral hedonism, Frank takes us along on his life-long quest for existential value and a platonic ideal of beauty.  This duality is made all the more profound, poignant, and ironic by the stark contrast between mother and son wherein each complements the other in a sort of yin-yang template of who we all are.  Where one is grotesquely stumpy and grounded in his life, the other is breathtakingly aquiline and ethereal in hers.  Yet for each, the essence  of self belies the exterior image and hones in on the narrative's excellent opening directive: \\"Begin with beauty.\\"  Mr. Raymo, for his part, does, then maintains its presence to the tale's satisfying conclusion.<br />Narrative gems like this, \\"discovered\\" after a decade's wait on the shelves, again remind me: Good literature waits for us as long as necessary.	2004-04-16

Even heavily edited, it presents both the wheat and the chaff, which is the stuff of this genre.  We are shown bits and pieces at various stages of development with clear flashes of the whimsical e'clat of  \\"The Hitchhiker's\\" persona and intellect at work.  Of further interest are the brief bio tidbits, the eclectic periodical offerings, the travels with a patient wife, the ongoing battle with the demons of procrastination, and the gangly sense of self amid the masses of unpredictable humanity.   This book's central thesis is Adams himself, rather than any sort of fictional tale-telling by the author.  As such, it might prove to be a background goldmine for any research paper assignment, an increasing probability given the place of the Hitchhiker's Trilogy in modern fiction.  <br />I got the same sense of an old friend, warts and all, from Richard Brautigan's \\"An Unfortunate Woman\\" which his daughter released twenty years after  the author's death.  In both books, enough of the polished wordsmith remains for the seeker of a last morsel to savor.	2003-09-08

However, it is a fun ride in that the author's narrative techniques are inventive, with interior question/answer sections posing as variants of traditional inner monologues (which are also abundantly present.)  Beyond this, the standard dialogue exchanges are crisp and fun to overhear.  Chapter length varies wildly also, making this subtitled \\"love story\\" seem part Vonnegut, part writing exercise.  <br />Twenty-something Harry Driscoll, from wealth and an Ivy-pedigree, is a drudge, a mere editorial assistant, in a New York publishing house. This salary-challenged NY life is well-drawn, as is the amorous folly that Harry creates for himself by falling into bed with the wrong women at the wrong time. This becomes clear when he finds himself actually falling in love with Evie, a newby just hired at the publishing house.   Her presence as an honest, open counterpoint to his snidely ?haute? sense of self and task finally sparks a revelation of sorts in Harry, both personally and professionally.     <br />Whether self-help \\"Dummy's Guides\\" to personal self-actualization are the bane of modern day publishing or not a moot point.  The submission (from the \\"slush pile\\") which Harry sniffs at with disdain and ignores turns out to be the \\"career maker\\" for Evie.  This irony is deepened further by the apparent makeover of self which Harry experiences in the novel's conclusion.   <br />Not since Wolfe's flawed \\"A Man in Full\\" has a character undergone such an unexpected change of heart.  Unfortunately, it seems dishonest evolving in the character we'd come to know and enjoy in a somewhat darkly delicious way, given his ob-com quirks and glib dismissals of custom and convention.	2003-09-08

John Updike's \\"Seek My Face\\" is best thought of as an idealized oral history of America's post-WW II emergence as an aesthetic powerhouse in art world. Here, the primary narrative device is a single day's interview between the now elderly Hope, widow of several famous American artists, and the thirty-something Kathryn, working for her on-line magazine. As the day wears on -- and it does drag somewhat -- and the interior monologues unfold, both women become somewhat neurotically hip voices of their respective generations. Likewise, both come to signify what's changed -- and what has not -- regarding the woman's role in contemporary society. <br />Hope's narrative musings are their most coherent and informative as the author takes his cues from Lee Miller's actual marriage to Jackson Pollock, rather than with the elements detailing her subsequent marriages. There Updike develops an amalgam of the \\"uber-modern American artist\\" by adding dollops of Warhol, Lichtenstein, Thiebaud, etc. together. While this may create a useful survey of the period, the collage nature does not create sharp, compelling characterizations.<br />The more knowledge of art theory and history one brings to this novel, the greater the reward. It might have been a better read had Updike stayed only with the now-mythic Pollack and his muscular \\"push-pull\\" of the elements of composition and media that emerged before he achieved his own self-destruction. The post-Pollack elements are murky in comparison, somewhat like a kindergartener's overworked finger-painting. If only someone had yanked the page away just twenty seconds before.	2003-08-07

Jonathan  Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\" is the best-written book you'll ever not want to necessarily finish.  Imbued with the hyper-present in all its convoluting and devious ways -- the Net, neo-Europe, club drugs, insider trading, et al --, it is exact in its artistry and its several narrative lines showing that a family can be more dysfunctional than the sum of its parts.   <br />Of the many memorable moments, two immediately come to mind (perhaps explaining my overall ambivalence here):  First is now-elderly Alfred, in full Parkinson's-caused dementia in his stateroom on a cruise, trying to trap the quick, agile bits of excrement that are escaping his system and must be put back in.  The panic, confusion, shame, and general self-loathing are so palpable that it becomes a shared experience of a possible future all sane folks must fear.  The other is the depressing dynamic too often employed by those ill-suited couples teetering on the brink of a messy divorce:  Using the kids as weapons of mass  degradation and denial of affection.  This frames Alfred's son Gary and wife Caroline's tense existence with their little boys.  It is portrayed so acutely  that it could serve as a case study for all the budding marriage counselors out there.<br />Undeniably, this is a dazzler, splendid in its narrative wizardry.  It'll remain with you, like it or not. Perhaps though you ought to look elsewhere for this summer's beach-read.	2003-05-31

Simon Winchester's \\"The Map That Changed the World\\" is 20% too long, with some convoluted and repetitive narrative stretches (and personal reminiscences tossed in for good measure.)  At its best - and there is so much that is so good - , this nonfiction rendering reads like a good mystery with all the relevant components: rivalries, jealousies, fortunes, and the quintessentially British classism complicating all things.  However, the overarching mystery - just what lies beneath the visible expanses of earth - is what William Smith unearthed (literally,) obsessed over,  analyzed, and finally solved during his unheralded half-century at the task of establishing the validity and veracity of geology. Happily, he finally did gain the esteem and respect that his humble birth had for decades denied him.<br />My other complaint (beyond the too long by 1/5 noted above) is that too little is included to pinpoint precisely where Mr. Smith dug up precisely what, thus enabling him to devise his pre-Darwinian theories of the earth's age and composition.  More illustrations of fossils and, definitely, more maps are needed here.  Fortunately, I was able to find a downloadable rendition of Mr. Smith's elegantly detailed and hand-painted document online.  Each of its fifteen 8 ½ x 11 pages could have filled a page of the text quite nicely, with a Playboy-esque centerfold of the entire project pulling it all together.  It is a remarkable document.<br />And again, as in \\"The Professor and the Madman,\\" Winchester has captured the peculiar English trait which has bestowed so much knowledge to the world: the obsessed eccentric driven to  eventual greatness and landmark discoveries.	2002-11-27

Tim O'Brien's \\"July, July\\" introduces us to an ensemble cast as it is gathering for its thirty-year class reunion at Minnesota's \\"Darton Hall College.\\"  As one would expect in such a \\"Big Chill\\" scenario, the past filters through the intervening years and makes its presence felt in the newly fifty-something crowd.  Thus, the angst of the younger set facing combat is juxtaposed with the anxiety of the older set facing the physical and philosophical challenges of aging.  However, the interplay among these ten people becomes a rather confusing emotional mish-mash, itself complicated by O'Brien's attempt to give voice to the entire multi-hued American scene from 1969 to 2000. (Yes, the 30th reunion is actually being held in the 31st year, an inside joke regarding the mental health of the event organizer.)  <br />O'Brien over-reaches here, both in trying to cover all socio-political attitudes of the late '60's, and in trying to develop convincing female characters.  The author's expected narrative strength, given his earlier Vietnam tales' critical successes, lies with his telling of a single `Nam event which persists in its nightmarish haunting of the present through an on-going series of flashbacks.  All the rest seems somewhat superficial and only incidentally included. <br />This sense is fueled by the gang's over-indulgences: too much drinking, some curiously dated hallucinogen use (unconvincingly described,) and the over-arching collective libido of these basically disappointed and disappointing group of alums.  As such, the entire event comes off as a disjointed gala.  Perhaps this is the author's narrative intent, to drop us - inebriated -- in media res, with all the revelers.  It worked for F Scott Fitzgerald in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" so why not?  Particularly, given the clearly echoed sense and style of both Hemingway and Fitz.  (In fact, at times I was expecting footnotes citing \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"Gatsby.\\")  <br />Bottom line: Given O'Brien's litany of awards and decades of praise, I was expecting more.  Yes, I finished it, but it is nowhere near being one of the page turners of his repute.	2002-11-27

Barry Werth's \\"The Scarlet Professor\\" is a rather dry but thorough account of Newton Arvin's self-destructive collision with the stultifying socio-political reality of post-WW II America.  As a communist homosexual, his well-deserved place as a respected national scholar and critic was a train wreck waiting to occur in that era of various mass hysterias.  The J. Edgar Hoover/McCarthy era, in fact, becomes the more fascinating part of this decades-long drama;  we are along with cadres of feds'n'cops as they coordinate and close in on the laughably Mitty-esque \\"ringleaders\\" in the series of \\"smut\\" busts.  How simple things were when the nation was so self-righteous that police squads fanned out across the land to root out stacks of gay pics and mags in people's private homes.  The most lasting and valuable upshot of all this high-sounding puffery was the Mapps v. Ohio ruling that disallowed use of any evidence seized in the warrantless busts these over-zealous Christian soldiers performed.<br />America's puritanical silliness aside, the book relates Arvin's personal failings, self-loathing, doubts, and travails as being the focal catalyst of much of what has become conventional wisdom regarding Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Longfellow.  Of each, Arvin was able to discern a specific experiential and/or psychosexual linkage with himself;  it is this synthesis that acts as Arvin's Rosetta stone in deciphering the deeper deconstructions of his authors` lives and works.<br />I'll leave the more esoteric literary arguments to others.  Read this as a historical document of an era rapidly fading from America's contemporary memory - so long as you don't take stone bosom-covering AG Ashcroft too seriously.  He would have fit right in during those strangely paranoid fifties.	2002-06-24

John Lanchester's \\"Mr Phillips\\" is the literary equivalent of that wonderfully quirky film \\"Being John Malkovich\\" a few years ago.  From the first sentence, we are dropped in medias res into the curiously cool mindset of just fired (\\"made redundant\\" in his accountant's patois) Mr Phillips.  It is Monday morning as we lie in bed with slumbering Mrs Phillips and drift into our various fantasies of other women, each meticulously \\"rated\\" in a manner befitting an ob-com CPA.  Thus are the two central motifs ignited:  women (and sex generally) and descriptive numeracy of all sorts.<br />From here, fiftyish Mr Phillips, who has decided not to reveal his employment situation to his wife (or two grown sons,) goes through the typical work-a-day motions and finds himself wandering aimlessly for the first time in over thirty years.  His observations and analyses place us squarely in London, which, as usual, becomes an outsized character per se, one which shapes and effects its teeming international amalgam.  Throughout, we are treated to\\"number/probability/odds\\" rants about any and all things.  Regarding the lottery frenzy, for example, we find that \\"proper\\" actuarial tables show that \\"in order for the probability of winning the jackpot to be greater than the odds of being dead by the time of the draw, one would have to bet no earlier than three and a half minutes before the draw.\\"  Put another way, death has a greater chance of finding us than does the lotto fairy.  This is but one of hundreds of revelations, all put forth with a completely straight-face.  <br />The tics, eccentricities, inner symbols, fears, joys, memories, and fantasies - both light and dark -crowd the currents of this odd stream of consciousness.  But, honestly, I now need to go shower to get the Underground's grimy Tube air off myself.  Good to have been there, but also good to be home.

Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" succeeds on many levels but, in the end, comes up short as a wholly satisfying tale.  Whether primarily seen as an unfolding mystery, a sweeping family saga, a novel of manners, or a psychological study - each focus is fuzzed by the piecemeal intrusion of the others.  As a result, the full 351 pages never really become more than the sum of its distinct parts.  This overall reaction is probably due to great expectations not being met because there are many good things here to appreciate and savor.  While I would certainly recommend that friends take it out of the library, I do not think it needs to be added to one's personal collection, a cumulative hobby I've long advocated.<br />Told in three parts (with a necessary epilogue,) the tale revolves around 13-year-old Briony's breathlessly melodramatic lie about the \\"rape\\" of a cousin.  The longish first part takes us through a single day in 1935 which culminates in the faux crime.  The plot result is the imprisonment of her sister Cecelia's beau Robbie.  Part Two then fast-forwards five years hence to the British humiliation at Dunkirk which we see through the disjointed perspective of Robbie's battle fatigue.  Part Three shows us Briony's passage to nursing school in London and her eventually seeking atonement for her pernicious fabrication years before.  The epilogue is barely satisfactory in answering further questions that have been raised in passing.<br />As I say, maybe borrow a copy sometime but don't plan on this being a \\"must read\\" for this season at the beach.	2002-05-26

Dave Eggers'  \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" is perfectly titled:  Over the top (to be sure) but honest and accurate enough to be taken at its word.  Given the opening premise of a dysfunctional family rendered more so by the deaths of both mom and dad within months of one another, one does wonder if it's more befitting an Oprah list or a Tuesday Movie of the Week.  However, the persona Mr. Eggers adopts lets us know quickly that MTV's \\"Real World\\" would be a more apt venue.  Oddly (or not,) that original \\"reality show\\" comes into play vividly later in the book. <br />As with Hester's Pearl in the Hawthorne's \\"Scarlet Letter,\\" much of the humor, sense, and sensibility alluded to in the title arise from the author's little brother, \\"Toph\\" with whom we grow from his sixth to this twelfth birthdays.  What is done to, for, and with him by his older siblings IS utterly heartbreaking and wonderful.  That the author and his `lil bro are \\"world class beach Frisbee throwers\\" is one of the more fun and animated motifs in this sprawling (and often rambling/ranting) work.<br />It is a fast and engrossing read -- if you're of (or wondering about) the much-dissected \\"Generation X.\\"  Oddly, since 9/11, that all seems more than a mere decade past....	2001-10-16

Arthur Golden`s \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is an intriguing insider's look at a world we Westerners have only  (and crudely) made assumptions about.  Golden masks himself as an NYU Japanese history professor whom the now-elderly geisha, Sayuri, has chosen to tell of her long, successful career as one of the last and most-renowned geisha of the 20th century.  As such, the narrative is told in first person, this voice being that of a sensitive woman who has lived a harrowing orphan's life during the momentous decades before and during WW II in the geisha village of Gion.  Momentous global events are muffled and distant in her highly stylized and ritualistic existence.<br />The rich detail, varied characters (clients and rival geisha,) chronological sweep of time and place, plus hidden schemes and revelations all combine masterfully to make this an ideal \\"lose-yourself-in\\" read.  It became my haven when 9/11 was casting its darkest cloud over us all.  Pick it up to be swept away.	2001-10-03

Jim Mullen's &quot;It Takes A Village Idiot&quot; recounts an entertaining and insightful journey from mid-town Manhattan to the village of &quot;Walleye in Catskills County,&quot; a fictitious analog of some genuine place three hours north of urban civilization. Mullen is riotously out of place up in rural dairy farm country and maintains a suitably haute attitude about his rustic neighbors, for a year anyway. But then come the telling clues in his narrator's voice -- and the &quot;weekend&quot; travel schedule which has morphed into driving up on Thursday night to return on Tuesday night. Something is definitely happening here. How can a 'flatlander&quot; remain so defined if he's only spending one day a week there? Short answer: He can't. The trouble is that his surroundings seem as protean as he. I was glad for this psychological movement, the growth of self from experiences, that sets this fun and funny read apart from Sedaris' flat &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot; Here are two NY writers, one feebly snide and sniggering about anything that isn't &quot;Big Apple,&quot; the other maturely confident enough to acknowledge the good and the bad in all arenas.

McCullough's panoramic narrative is based on an  information lode that is pure gold: the network of letters, often written on a daily basis in the darkest of times,  among the Adams family members -- and all the other luminaries of the era that literally changed everything.   <br />You will approach the conclusion with the same sense of dread you've felt reading your favorite novel:  Don't end!

My single question:  Can Thomas Jefferson ever reclaim his former luster once this portrait of him seeps into our collective consciousness?  Doubtful.

Without question, Sedaris has a curious family and background;  his sense of humor (such as it is) is understandable both as to its origins and its indispensability.  What is surprising is that this persona , sounding so much like the voice of a bright freshman who's found his way into a narrative lit class, is actually coming from a middle-aged boomer.  A literary guise?  Some irony-building device?  Well, having seen the author on late night recently, I think not.  This is the man, a timid milquetoast befuddled by much of the adult world.  Paging Walter Mitty....<br />This book is a mildly amusing diversion of a man whose stunted vision shrinks before large ideas, diverse cultures, and experiences beyond his own deafening self-absorption.

Scenery changes; names and faces change; presumably, the world we all inhabited was still out there and changing (though little of it invades the head and heart of this confused co-dependant-in-waiting ); -- Sharon doesn't, aside from a costume shift from Hawaiian floral to Hasidic basic.  Worse yet, once she has finally arrived at her place of personal epiphany, the Crown Heights Bailystok community, it seems more like some nightmarish cult with her reaction more befitting the wide-eyed followers of  David Koresh.  Oy.  Curiously, all the Jewish-ness of this novel seems to be coming to us from some \\"Orthodox Judaism for Dummies\\" guidebook.  Pick up any Chaim Potok title for the real thing well-told.

Carl Hiaasen's \\"Sick Puppy\\" is a fun, funny read, just perfect for taking to the beach of  Toad Island, Florida, the pivotal plot locale around which the looniness of eco-terrorist Twilly Spree unfolds...or maybe \\"explodes\\" is the better verb.  Be prepared to suspend your disbelief as the tussles begin. Or maybe this is how things truly are in The Sunshine State whose recent madcap history would blend seamlessly into this novel. <br /> As it is, Hiaasen has populated his pages with a high-roller lobbyist and his trophy wife, a golf resort developer with a pair of  Barbie doll wannabes, old state pols, hit men, and a contractor who's been at war with chipmunks (and their habitats) his whole life.  Oh, and besides Twilly, there actually is a \\"sick puppy\\" romping through the tale. <br />Just don't be upset that all the plot elements -- whether funny, torturous, murderous, legal or illegal, sexy, or scary -- are told in the same light way.

Aside from bogging down in awkward (and repetitive) \\"bio-ethics\\" dialogues in places, the pace is suitably quick and the interactions, natural and enjoyable.  We follow three sets of  protagonists, with each pair personifying some thematic element of what becomes Kingsolver's dual homage to Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" and Al Gore's \\"Earth in the Balance.\\"  For the reader unaware of the concept of \\"Gaia,\\" that is, of seeing our planet as a single cell of interrelated processes and systems, this narrative is a respectful introduction, albeit a bit heavy-handed at times.  <br />As usual, Ms. Kingsolver's gender bias sets forth the males as inarticulate predators whose only task is to scatter their seed to insure survival of the species.  Be it coyotes,  apple orchards,  luna moths, or homo sapiens -- it's all sexual at base, with the males causing more trouble (after their initial contribution) than they're worth.  This is the literary equivalent of \\"Who Let The Dogs Out!?\\"  Conversely, the females are all nurturers of their various broods, stewards of their natural arenas, and inherently aware of their place in the eternal (and seasonal/lunar/diurnal) cycles. In essence, the parallel sound track is \\"I Am Woman\\" and/or \\"Respect.\\"  Predictably, the gender collisions create much of both the action and the comic relief.  <br />The flora and fauna become an overarching character in that their various impacts on the humans often direct actions, fears, hopes, and even continuance itself.  Ms. Kingsolver's lush Tennesseean landscape moves beautifully through the seasons as do the variety of farming tasks and produce.  Reintroduction of species once hunted or blighted to regional extinction is a central plot engine and character motivation.

Angelic CIA cowboy Switters is a conceptual pastiche caught up in the gauziest filigree of a plot, but that's okay because just hangin' out with him is riot enough.  That this book seems more like an anecdotal dossier, a character study told in Robbins' always entertaining figurative fireworks, doesn't take it off my \\"must read\\" list. \\"Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates\\" is a hoot -- w/ a sinister Vatican, a metaphysical Invacare hovercraft, several naughty nuns, a pair of stinkin' jackals, and a subatomic particle point.  And that says nothing about shaman \\"Today is Tomorrow\\" and his mentoring Switters on the trip of trips in the \\"too goddam vivid\\" Amazonian rain forests.   Vintage Robbins?  Well, yes and no (much like the vibrating sub-quark polarities residing at the base of everything.  See p. 404.)<br />Unfortunately, as sometimes happens with the trinkets and shiny junk that Robbins' \\"magpie plots\\"  have commandeered, the smooth circularity of elements feels frantically stapled together toward the end.  Other Robbins' titles are more satisfying as seamless and sensuously fun narratives;  for me, Jitterbug Perfume comes immediately to mind.  But don't misunderstand;  Switters is definitely NOT victimized the way Wolfe's \\"A Man In Full\\" is:  by brutal abandonment of the creator's sense and sensibility.  Robbins' tale is even protean enough to survive the collision of fact and fiction regarding the \\"Third Secret of Fatima,\\"  which Pope John Paul inconveniently chose to reveal as part of the Millennium wahoo early in 2000.  His and Robbins' versions are different;  so who to believe?<br />Regardless, get this entertaining, quotable nugget for yourself, and pick up any of three or four earlier titles for your innocent, inexperienced buds.  Guaranteed:  If you still annotate your books at all, \\"Yep\\" and \\"Ha!\\" will be filling the margins (along with the typical Robbins' \\"Oh-la-la!'s\\")	2000-12-16

Care to contemplate the cosmos from a Buick Skylark doing 115 mph across New Mexico?  Or how `bout sharing an hour or two with \\"Naked Lunch\\" author Burroughs?  Or being verbally assaulted by the Pakistani clerk at a Day's Inn motel about the ersatz \\"godliness\\" of Albert Einstein?  Grab this easy afternoon's read for all this and so much more.<br />Michael Paterniti's \\"Driving Mr. Albert\\" presents its own set of paradoxes as it dances around the complex cultural enigma of Albert Einstein, here represented by his most intriguing feature:  that famous mind whose brain chunks are now bobbing in Tupperware-contained formaldehyde in the Skylark's trunk. Only slightly less engaging is the tale of the pathologist, Dr. Thomas Harvey, who had been the keeper of the brain since he'd performed the autopsy in April, 1955.  Likewise paradoxical is that this factual account is more delicious and odder than the various urban legends that have preceded it regarding the revered gray matter.  And, given its impact on the many lives described -- from Einstein's own dysfunctional loves and children to all those flash-fried souls at Hiroshima and Nagasaki to those involved with current neuro-research and finally to the vast marketability of the soft-eyed, wild-haired icon -- , it's only fair that the author include himself as one of the affected.  <br />Among the various biographical paradoxes are the granting of a Einstein's Nobel for the \\"wrong\\" reasons (neither specific nor general relativity), the physicist's own sense that he'd failed to produce lasting insights (much as his theories had rewritten the elegant machine imagery of the Newtonian cosmos), his well-cultivated pacifist voice calling for the building of the bomb (and his subsequent denials), et al.<br />These bio tidbits are tossed off in passing as we ride along with Paterniti on his I-70 passage from sea to shining sea with the 84-year-old Harvey and the spectral presence of Einstein himself.  As both the teller and a participant, the author does a delicate balancing act between the \\"Me\\" reacting and interacting with all the \\"Not Me\\"  swirling around this multi-tied tale.  I was only slightly annoyed to know about the author's \\"Sara\\" left behind (forever or not?) in Maine and his snit about not being given a private showing of the brain sooner.  <br />This refreshing read is no \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" or \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" though it does contain many of the best elements of both.  It is a fun, wide-ranging ramble around a thorny portrait of the ethereal, erratic Einstein.	2000-10-23

Richard Brautigan's \\"An Unfortunate Woman: A Journey,\\" composed on the160 pages of a spiral notebook with Pilot pens back in '82, is a post-modern (but doggedly pre-computer) ramble through the \\"free-form calendar map\\" of Brautigan's initial months at being a 47-year-old. Clearly, he is neither very good at nor very happy with this profession, thus the uncharacteristic (for him) gloom in both tone and content. Might this pervasive sentiment be the result of our months with him being sandwiched between the deaths of two women, one to suicide, the other to cancer? Well, yes, but as Brautigan reveals, he is also feeling \\"a terrible sadness coming over (him)\\" as a weary writer, nearing 50, who critiques the text we are reading as being only \\"so many inconclusive fragments, sophomoric humor, cheap tricks, and detailless details.\\" Of course, he is right about this, but then it is, after all, an unedited offering, published posthumously by his daughter, for Brautigan himself committed suicide just two years later.<br />At times it is uncomfortable observing the forced torture that writing has become for him; one can almost sense Brautigan's using his own workshop techniques as cues to try to restart his own creative engines: OK, gimme me a page on, say, getting a portrait taken with a chicken in Hawaii, or seeing a lady's single new shoe in an intersection,...etc. Happily, this is a partially successful endeavor as evident by flashes of the gentle<BR>metaphors, deadpan humor, and descriptive wit for which he's fondly remembered.	2000-07-06

As a historian, Ambrose's voice and expertise  are most apparent in detailing the early stages of the assault's planning,  as he provides insights into the personalities (and distinct styles) of  Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery, et al.  The telling is most poignant when  it reveals -- in tired, frightened messages composed in the fields of  battle -- the plain truths of war for the loved ones back home.

Cartmill's \\"A View to a Death in the Morning\\" is a scholarly mix of anthropology, history, sociology, and biology -- all focused on the  hydra-headed question of  \\"Must man prey on and kill animals?\\"  This is one  of those subjects that each reader will address from his own biases and  experiences, a fact acknowledged by the author when he tells us that \\"the  motives of hunting are vague and visceral;  nonhunters find them hard to  understand.\\" Clearly, this author's perspective puts him in the SPCA/PETA  corner.  As his thesis unfolds, this increasingly becomes the inescapable  place to be when rationally critiquing the bloodlust that drives modern man  to this activity (\\"sport\\" doesn't honestly apply, given the odds-on  outcomes of the hunt.)<br />Hunters will hurl this title into the fire fairly  quickly unless they have a capacity to maintain composure in the face of a  reasoned, well-defended argument;  likewise, those anti-hunters will find  cogent proofs and a compendium of socio-cultural allusions, anecdotes, and  references to bolster their perspective.  From the Bible to Bambi, it's all  here -- except for the curious omissions of the bison's decimation,  Melville's philosophical focus in \\"Moby Dick,\\" commentary on Faulkner's  \\"The Bear,\\" and Hemingway's fiction and nonfiction generally.

Read this masterwork twice, first as a literary chronicle of the last half of \\"America's Century\\" and then as a literal chunk of Americana per se, that is,  as our era's own \\"Huck Finn.\\" <br />At the tale's onset, a heroic  home-run ball becomes the artifact that propels the reader through the  psychodrama that has been our postmodern experience, a era shaped largely  by the other event that October day in 1951:  the commie  detonation of an  A-bomb.  The effects of both \\"shots heard round the world \\"  become the  central interlocking theses of Nick and Klara's odyssey, one often rendered  grotesquely obsessive in both tone and content by the manic consumerism of  our electronically interwoven lives and its natural consequence: waste  production.  If a thematic Mississippi River flows here, it is waste  management -- of both the actual and metaphysical sort.  As such, on one  level, the underworld revealed is the unseen industrial plumbing that  ingests spent plutonium fuel rods, toxic trash, assorted toxic biohazards,  and wayward barges of Fishkill Island refuse.  Yet, on another level, the  underworld is the collective cognitive wiring capable of culturally  assimilating abandoned B-52's -- the ultimate weapons of mass destruction  -- into a desert \\"art installation,\\" or of morphing the appalling Bronx  ghetto graffiti into haute showcases splashed across the pages of &quot;Art  in America.&quot;   Managing all varieties of our own flotsam and jetsam  has always been -- and will always be -- the primary cultural catalyst of  the human condition and progression.<br />Delillo's narrative strategy  requires both patience and faith from the reader since often few overt cues  about speakers and situations are given until well into pages of dialogue.   This stylistic device becomes problematic because the content spans decades  and continents in this freely-associated socio-cultural panorama of  America's last fifty years.  Along the way, we are treated to acute  portrayals of many personalities, among them J. Edgar Hoover and Lenny  Bruce with his memorable riffs of \\"We're all gonna die!\\" punctuating his  stand-up routine.  Stitching this complex patchwork together is the sense  that, in this modern era,  all is as eternal -- or as ephemeral -- as an  endlessly looping videotape of an apparent existence where, in the final  chapters, \\" Everything is everywhere all the time.\\"  This ultimate  modernity is counterbalanced by the image of the other universal in the  human experience: Bruegel's \\"The Triumph of Death.\\"   That we see this  allegorical painting surrealistically through the fastidiously fairy-esque  consciousness of Hoover is a narrative trick only Delillo could  successfully pull off.  And does he ever....<br />I hope this review doesn't  contribute to this grand work's being doomed to the \\"was supposed to but  didn't read\\" stack of titles growing ever-taller in our video-driven  culture. \\"Underworld\\" is certainly no beach read, but then neither was Huck  -- and that title has had fairly good successes over the years.	2000-05-22

Pick up some Hawthorne or  Poe or Lovecraft....but here I am, falling into the quagmire of using this  space as a chat room -- which it isn't.<br />For me, the central mystery here  is greater than any in the novel's plot per se:   Why was this amateurish  book published in the first place?   Its characters are mere  two-dimensional cut-outs pasted on a thinly-drawn New England setting.  Its   central narrative features are 1) inexplicable and/or nonexistent  character developments and 2) an oddly incestuous confusion between the  characters' words/thoughts and the author's voice/persona.  Perhaps an  occasional elegance of phrasing or some trace of original language use  might have redeemed this novel, but even these minimal literary traits are  absent.  Ms. Hoffman, please recall what your narrative comp prof once told  you (and what you've no doubt parroted to workshop attendees): Use language  to let us know how the characters feel and think rather than just telling  us they're happy, afraid, etc.  Also, once you've determined an omniscient  author's point of view, be consistent with it.  My guess is that those wily  publishers knew that anything w/ \\"Alice Hoffman\\" on the cover would sell  during the Christmas season.  How right they were.   <br />Fortunately, I  found my copy abandoned on the bus;  I would return it -- if I didn't  consider such an act to be littering....	2000-04-13

Suitably apt to the book's core thesis is the fact that some of its anecdotes have become &quot;quaint&quot; so soon.   Pick it up for a good afternoon's read, and not for the sort of  stimulating newness so apparent in Gleick's title character of  &quot;Genius&quot; or the pervasive philosophic depth he plumbs in  &quot;Chaos.&quot;	2000-03-18

Carey's &quot;Jack Maggs&quot; is a narrative gem, crisply written with a dark relentless momentum as it unfolds in early 19th century London.  Its tone is steeped in the miasma of fog rising on the Thames, obscuring the  pasts - and the present motives - of all the players. <br />Title character  Jack Maggs is that ante-postmodern ideal of a villain wherein a genuinely  huge and good heart triumphantly barges through the foul abuses of a  childhood spent learning, then practicing the art of housebreaking.   Witness Jack's first day on the job as an eight-year-old \\"Climbing Boy\\" who  thought he was being taken to a new school: \\"Silas carefully lifted off the  chimney pot and placed it on the roof.  Said he -- All right, young  whipper-snapper, down you go. (I hesitated) So he picked me up, and slid me  in, as simple as dropping shot into a cannon.\\"  This child, later  apprehended, tried, and deported to Australia, eventually becomes the man  who often \\"stooped for his ankle knife.  He felt the rough sure grip of the  handle he himself had made with twine and tar.  A convict's knife, it dated  from before the time when he could have afforded the finest steel and ivory  for the handle.  He crouched now, a powerful shadow in the doorway of his  own living room, drawing the blade in wide circle through the night.\\"  Yet,  he is just as certainly \\"the prodigal father,\\" undertaking a journey of  lethal risk to rejoin and know his long-lost ward in this finely drawn  story.  <br />&quot;Jack Maggs&quot; satisfies on many levels.  It paints  vivid portraits of a host of eccentrics, among them a young novelist who  dabbles dangerously in hypnosis and magnet therapy, his dumpy wife and  saucy sister-in-law, a nouveau-riche grocer with household help he neither  wants or needs, and a maid in his employ who's also his \\"Good Companion\\" on  cold English nights.  What a fun bunch, and each packed with the genuine  baggage of the era: its fears, wisdoms, idioms, and oddities.  All elements  collide at the entry of Jack Maggs into their lives.  At the same time, the  novel addresses some thoroughly contemporary issues, such as the  psychiatric validity (or not) of  \\"repressed memory\\" revelations and the  consequences of a life where no \\"Roe v. Wade\\" exists.  <br />A final note:   Whether or not you've read (and recall) &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is  irrelevant to your enjoyment of Mr. Carey's novel.  Although such  background might add context and color, this work stands on its own.	2000-02-16

The jacket blurbs on Tom Wolfe's &quot;A Man in Full&quot; resound with the gravitas of praise from all the usual suspects: eminent voices of &quot;The New York Times,&quot;&quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; et al.   Given its bloated length and absurd disunities of character and plot, one  suspects that these breathless accolades must stem either from A) four  decades of Wolfe's éclat (and the white suits) having blinded the critical  eyes, or from B) these cover snippets having been very heavily  edited--unlike the novel itself.  Either way,  the tale limps along, only  occasionally reflecting the glory days of Wolfe's productive past -- much  like its \\"ramblin'-wreck-from- Georgia-Tech\\" main character moves through  Atlanta's \\"New South\\" social, political, and corporate worlds.<br />Be ready  for stereotyped characters, plot lines that disappear without a trace,  disparate scenarios that struggle futilely to find connection, the most  improbable--and idiotic--plot denouement I've witnessed in many years, and  an insufferably supercilious attitude from the author.  Oh, and pull out  your old college text on Epictetus, renowned Greek stoic, since, evidently,  Mr. Wolfe did about halfway through composing this mess.  <br />I, a confirmed  Wolfe fan, am disappointed at both the inferior quality of this work and  the apparent cowardice of the critics unwilling to state the sorry truth.	1999-12-22

In &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; Kingsolver's use of separate and distinct personae as the tellers of the tale is very effective, particularly Adah's wonderfully slanted inner takes on the realities and  her many palindromes.  As is always the case with Kingsolver, the mothers,  daughters, sis-siblings, and assorted other femmes are wonderfully  portrayed as are their interactions; the men are flat, foolish, and  primarily incidental.                                              Otherwise, I thought Kingsolver's transitions between her narrative  fictional elements and the historical facts she researched and/or gleaned  from other sources were a bit forced.  It's an interesting time and take,  but for me her shorter tales are better.  And, as for &quot;feeling&quot;  the reality of post-colonial Africa, I think Hemingway's &quot;True at  First Light&quot; is vastly superior to this effort by Ms. Kingsolver.	1999-12-11

The funds-challenged liberal arts department with its washed-up, burnt-out profs running only on ego and envy is perfectly drawn.  It is a tale told  by a wag of a wit acting as the interim head. While it does feel more like  a man's than a woman's narrative (the way Kingsolver does w/ women), it is  such a hoot that all can enjoy it.  The goose on the cover cryptically says  it all!  Otherwise, the book  probes many interpersonal snafus, puzzles,  and conflicts within a family of intellectuals.<br />  I've already sent it  off to friends embarking on their myriad campus careers.  Two have already  informed me that they're busily taking notes....	1999-11-26
