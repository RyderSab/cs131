If you love to read about the weird coincidences between the JFK & Lincoln assasinations- i.e. Kennedy's and Lincoln's VP's were Johnson's and their dogs were named Ruby (just kidding) and other politico Forteana, this book is for you.  Every conservative libertarian's wet nightmare is here in full measure.  As a fellow reviewer said- deeper down the rabbit hole to find the real enemy of this tangled cabal of nefarious magi that pluck the threads of our reality, we find at the end of the book...Wandering Bishops & apostolic sucession!?  The reader will wonder if they missed something?  Not at all.  Disenfranchised effeminate men that like dressing up in ecclesiastical robes and flitting around in incense filled rooms with booming big organs are the worst we have to deal with?<br />We should be more concerned in fighting the real enemy in these waning days of Babylon, that of the raw greed and callousness of corporate globalism; rather than a group practicing what H.P. Blavatsky has called a \\"palpable fraud\\" in a make believe land of power and ceremonial influence.  True sinister forces at work in the world today have no inclination for symbolic masques in pursuing their agendas.<br />As a work of fantastic speculation- this is as good as any Stephen King or Dan Brown offering.	2005-09-22

This is one of the most enjoyable books on the hidden and suppressed labor history of American workers.  Made all the more enjoyable by the variety of people's artists/cartoonists that have contributed to what is surely a labor of love.  This is not what you're going to be taught in schools or colleges.  This book portrays clearly that long memorable struggle for dignity among the working class that continues to the present day.<br />The Wobblies held to a grass roots approach of organizing workers, prefering \\"crude vigor to polished banality\\", a system of priorites too little seen in these waning days of capitalism.  Each young person, parent and school should have this information available to them, for any soul not born with a silver spoon wedged in their mouth will come away from this history with a lump in your throat and a new spring in your step.  In light of encroaching globalism (that is no friend to worker's anywhere) this is a handbook to inspire and encourage a new generation to take control of their own destiny.<br />Solidarity Forever!<br />P.S.- Check out the recordings of Utah Phillips, the modern troubadour/sage of the Wobblies.	2005-08-31

This obscure book has been touted by followers of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy and its fascination with the divine Sophia and the Slavic spirituality that engendered it.  Andreev was a tortured man intellectually and spiritually even before the cruelties of the soviet regime were unleashed upon him.  Be that as it may, his assessments of historical forces and events are odd at times and intellectually embarrassing at others.  His assessment of slavery in America is clearly uninformed, and his suggestion of the pivotal role played by Harriet Beecher Stowe is laughable if it were not for a degree of sympathy for his suffering.  But much of his thought is clearly a product of a insular middle class soviet sensibility.  Other historical events are disturbingly quirky as seen through his orthodox Christic lens, including the development of Islam and other world events in which he attempts to show the esoteric shadows behind the forms on the world stage.  Again, a connection that appeals to Steiner's followers.<br />Regardless of the sources for Andreev's cosmic insights, we are best to heed Swedenborg's words that the inhabitants of subtle planes of existence are known to lie.  May Andreev's soul be at peace now that he knows the truth of the matter.	2005-08-31

Ms. Howell is a natural story teller and carries the reader along on that midwinter train ride to the upper reaches of Norway's mountains with Laura and her family.  As an adult I was fascinated and frustrated by the political fears and apprehensions that seem to haunt her parents, yet Laura obviously wise beyond her years knows how to cope and thrive in uncertain circumstances.  The friends she meets upon that Norwegian mountain opens her heart to joy and universality of the Christmas experience.  This is one Christmas book that avoids all the sentimental cliches that make similar books so mawkish.<br /><br />This was such an enjoyable read that I have ordered Ms. Howell's \\"Beejum Book\\" in anticipation of more reading pleasure.	2005-08-29

Keel (1930-2009)<br />Let me set the record straight- love the book, hated the travesty of the movie.  To compare the movie with the book is much like comparing ancient & modern Rome- there's a few remnants of the original here and there but not much else.  This is a classic work that demonstrates how truly strange our world and minds are.  From Keel's first published work, \\"Jadoo\\" onwards, I find an author that exemplifies a crisp journalistic style much like a paranormal Mickey Spillane that carries you along at an exciting pace.  This is the gothic non-fictional novel of the post-modern world in which intrusions into ordinary reality remain the enigmas of a surreal universe.<br />If you can locate a copy of the Illuminet Press version with the Frank Frazetta cover, you will be rewarded by an insightful afterword by Keel that places much into perspective after the initial events of 1966-67.  Highly recommended.  This is one book I read every year, waiting for a rainy weekend to escape into the wonder of an eclectic unknown.	2005-08-16

This is a book to keep and treasure.  At times the pathos is mingled with humor reminding one of the best of Hans Andersen's fairy tales.  The supernatural is interwoven with much of the natural world and the symbiotic relations between humans and nature create that \\"bardo\\" between worlds in which anything can happen.  The \\"Fisherman's Tale\\" is perhaps my favorite in the collection, it is a thoughtful & chilling meditation on life and death.

If you are seriously considering this as authoritative on the occult capers of the illuminist OTO, please read Martin Starr's comprehensive history of the OTO in North America, \\"The Unknown God\\".  This well researched work who's author is sympathetic to the aims of Thelema, will demonstrate what a pathetic, bloodless (pun intended) society it really is.  Comprised of ritual lunatics and socially inept souls that seek the company of fellow subculture geeks.  To elevate the OTO to a key player in the political cabals that surround us is ludicrous.  The OTO is the Society of Creative Anachronism of the occult world.<br />We should be far more concerned in fighting the real enemy, that of the raw greed of corporate globalism than a bunch of losers lost in make believe land.  True evil has no time for symbolic masques in pursuing their agendas. Leo Taxil & Diana Vaughan continue to serve as warnings for the true believer.	2005-03-14

This is a work that explores the literary history of western occultism and the terminal documents that make up that intellectual history.  This work stands in the effort to place before the public the historical reality that the esoteric has been a foundation stone upon which many cultural endeavors have been focused upon, but remain \\"outside\\" and unrecognized by many academics and scholars.<br />The chapter on the pre- revolution Russian occult literary scene is excellent and you will find yourself jotting down titles & authors to further explore.  Mr. Lachman's work is the first I can recall that provides a brief but welcome overview of the life of Gustav Meyrink.  Meyrink, remains sadly neglected by the English speaking esoteric world.  Again, I appreciate Lachman's effort to demonstrate that Swedenborg is the progenitor of much of the western esoteric world view.  It is not without noting that D.T. Suzuki called Swedenborg, \\"the Buddha of the North\\".<br />Highly recommended, this is one Muse that will continue to inspire, enlighten, and provoke even after repeated readings.	2005-01-28

It offers a wide range of opportunities to explore the highways and byways of Medieval & Renaissance worldviews.  Oldridge offers a unique insight into the how & why our ancestors viewed such transgressions to the social contract of the time, and the complete normalcy of those views.  What I found off putting was the rather superficial coverage that is offered to the topics the author selects.  I have found other books that explore similar topics with more depth and penache.  A welcome addition for the beginning student of historical oddities library.  The style of this book is scholarly in a Master's thesis sort of way with an odd forced sense of humor that is unwelcomed. It lacks the immediacy needed to communicate why we did & do the things we do as human beings.  In the final analysis- we are still creatures of absurd superstitions & prejudices.

Though a devotee of Victorian ghost stories and novellas, this collection is one of the bottom of the victorian barrel as to horror & tales of terror.  Some authors become unknown shortly after their demise, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  For many especially during the 19th century were vailant authors that wrote to scratch out a living, but who for the most part were uninspired by the gothick muse.  Many of the tales in this collection are of a melodramatic \\"penny dreadful\\" quality from that era.  A memorable tale of terror should grab the reader within a few pages and hold them until the last word.  Again, many of these stories made me feel like required college reading of minor Victorian authors.

(though I am very fond of Madeline myself)  There is a treasure trove of solid adult writings that have endearing qualities that commit themselves to fond memory.  Bemelmans was a bon vivant, gourmet, gourmand, traveller, and more importantly a student of human nature and all the quirks therein.  These elements plus a eye for the pathos of life make him a writer to be rediscovered & cherished.  Hotel Bemelmans was my personal introduction to his adult writings, and I have been a fan ever since.  This book will provide a smorgasbord of his style and eye for everyday foibiles within the microcosm of the grand hotel's of the past that he knew and loved so well.  His broad verbal and ink brush stokes, for he's the illustrator as well, can capture in a paragraph or a simple line drawing what other authors require pages to describe.

These blokes are the kind that you'd like to know for serious drinking and tale telling round a fireplace.  Yet their historical research is sound, students of local fortean folklore will note.  I find the tulpa theory neither \\"tired\\" nor overworked in throwing light on incidents of the unexplained.  What Mr. Redfern & company do is synthesize the \\"passport to magonia' ideas of Jacque Vallee with the trickster/metamind theories of John Keel along with their own experiences while on this madcap road trip.  The tulpa idea has merit and is worthy of further exploration.  The cast of characters encountered in this work range from the frighteningly memorable to the  freakish and pathetic.  On the whole this is not a scholarly exploration of the paranormal, but if you're as weary as I am of anal retentive pontification or blind belief as with most paranormal books today, this is refreshing & fun.	2004-09-26

Rather we have a history of those men and woman that knew human conditions need constructive human responses in building a better world for all.  History is said to be defined by the victors, thus this is not a re-telling of deeds by dead rich white men who populate most books of American history.<br /><br />In Freethinkers, we find the life, work and deeds of fellow Americans that are often ignored or misrepresented by mainstream books of history.  These are people that did not accept the status quo as the divine order of things, rather they continued to carry that revolutionary spark that makes America & Americans a unique people in their quest for a better life for all citizens and not a selected few.  This is a heritage we can be proud of, American's that often sought a crude vigor to polished banality.<br /><br />In examining mainstream history we often find the divine right of European potentates translated into America for a white male dominated monied class floating like precious cream at the top of American society supported by those that labor below.  Religion has and always will be a tool for complicity and submission in the social contract.  For all heterodox Americans from Deist to Humanist, this book will put a spring in your step and a lump in your throat by the examples of the nobility of those that came before us in their efforts to show that the \\"Angels of our better nature\\" are within each one of us here and now.

A bit of the Grimm brothers, with a dash of Weimar dada and an big dose of the unintentionally sick humor of the classic Struwwelpeter by today's standards.  This is a classic on some level, not sure where or what.  It is not that unusual a children's book when compared to other mid-Victorian attempts at the moral edification of youth.  Perhaps a fear of the wages of infantile sins consisting of thumb sucking, poor grooming, cruelty, matches and finicky eaters would help with some of the childish monsters many parents raise today.  I have a dream to place copies of Struwwelpeter in every waiting room in America for the kiddies enjoyment.  Maybe the injections & dental drills will not seem so bad after all.

A polymath when it comes to the exploration of the esoteric byways of human psychology. In reading this work one immediate thing was apparent, he reviews some of the strongest cases for survival from the archives of psychical research/parapsychology.  Yet I felt still unconvinced by the data he presents.  It neither moved me toward nor away from the question of survival after death.  His emphasis on the need for celebrating living itself each day to the fullest, while at the same time \\"keeping our death before us\\" as practiced by Tibetan Lamas and other contemplatives is the message of most guides for the living regarding the afterlife.  Grosso's analogy of Bucke's \\"cosmic consciousness\\" and Maslow's \\"peak experiences\\" as a foretaste of things to come leaves me unsatisfied on some level as well.  The inevitability of death seems to me to be a message from nature that in the final analysis it does not matter.  A life well lived should be open to all possibilities, be it the dualism of Christianity (which I doubt), reincarnation, oblivion or nirvana.  As Alexander Pope wrote, \\"whatever is, is right.\\"  All speculative works on the afterlife seem to be an attempt to convey the experience of color to a person blind from birth.  I am not convinced that death and what lay after (if anything) is communicable to the living.  But this is a vailant attempt in that endeavor.	2004-01-29

Smith and the Thelemites	Books	5	25	28	N	Y	A definitive history of the OTO in America	Martin Starr has written the definitive history of the OTO in North America.  The fascination for us in examining this history is the observing the inner nobility and often mundane outer lives of those who tread the esoteric way.  Biographies of occultists in general are not often \\"exciting\\" in terms of events in their outer lives, but rather in the viewing of the rich inner landscape such persons possess and what motivates them to pursue such arcane studies with little compensation as to what many would consider edifying ones life in the world.  This work goes toward a psychological/sociological study of esoteric subcultures.<br /><br />What one comes away with from reading this expensive but worthy book is the sheer middle class pedestrian qualities of these Thelemites.  The OTO comes across as a distincly pseudo- Masonic organization, led by a bullying petulant Aleister Crowley.  This reinforced my idea that the OTO is essentially a Crowley personality cult.  Most of the characters that inhabit the landscape of this book are not terribly sympathetic, lechery amd egos litter this landscape.  Some of the insights we gain is an examination of the North American occult scene through the mid-20th century, the alliances both tried and attempted by members of the OTO with Theosophical, Masonic, and Wandering Bishop bodies & tributaries make for fascinating reading.  To see the toadying love/hate relationship Crowley had for Theosophy is amusing.  Crowley attempting character assasination of C.W. Leadbeater by accusations of homosexuality & sodomy is the height of absurdity and hypocrisy.<br /><br />For those that read & enjoyed the biography of Jack Parsons, \\"Sex and Rockets\\" published by Feral House and came away wanting more, this book is for you.  Does this book motivate my WILL to become a member of the OTO, absolutely not.  But of course a reading of the Bible, the book of Mormon & L. Ron Hubbard does not make me want to join those personality cults either.  Be that as it may, this is a valuable contribution to the history of 20th century spirituality and Mr. Starr is to be commended.s is a valuable contribution to the history of 20th century spirituality and Mr. Starr is to be commended.	2004-01-07

I had then 2 realizations, Damon Knight's bio still stands as the only legitimate bio on Fort (who is worthy of far better than this mishmash) and a paragraph by Keel is often more insightful than entire books by others.  I'd read Bennett's &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; and enjoyed it, an adept descriptive travelog of the saucer mania in the 1950's.  But this alleged study of the life, work &amp; ideas on Fort is a travesty.  This book is more about Bennett's fortean awakening, his political education and his various axes he wishes to grind in public.  All in all, it's more about the author and less about Fort.

But if you're expecting John Silence to be another Carnacki or Sherlock Holmes you will be disappointed.  Dr. Silence is a near mythic one dimensional character who merely serves as the vehicle for resolution in the stories.  The stories become increasingly more sophisticated and interesting as the book progresses.  \\"A Psychical Invasion\\" was nearly unreadable for me, dull & plodding, it reminded me of Dion Fortune's lesser efforts at fiction.  But I hung in and was amply rewarded by my patience.  You will find Blackwood comfortable with the supernatural as a plot device, considering his esoteric interests and membership in AE Waite's reorganized Golden Dawn.  Blackwood's greatest gift as a \\"ghost\\" story writer was his ability to create landscapes with a naturalists eye for detail and underlying threats to human dominion of the setting.  Character development is not his forte.  But that is a minor criticism of one of the best writer's of sheer terror of the 20th century.

What would have made Joy flee the communist esoteric pleasures of living with Mr. Gresham to the arms of a rather sexless University Don?<br /><br />This is the great novel of the American underbelly.  A society that has it's own culture both inside and out of the norm.  I often see \\"Nightmare Alley\\" as the progenitor to the later fantasies of Wm. Burroughs.  The grotesque & arabesque of the seemingly mundane American landscape is explored with a naked eye in this.  And this Fantgraphics edition is your best bet for becoming aquainted to this lesser known masterpiece.	2003-05-19

Which as an old debate instructor of mine characterized as the \\"shotgun\\" approach to a presentation, a lot of points scattered here & there, but no internal cohesion.  There is little new here that can't be discovered in other much better works of the same genre.	2003-05-09

Every young person in the world should have this book placed in their hands as a coming of age gift, before the &quot;world&quot; of belief systems both secular and religious deadens their minds to free inquiry.  As Wordsworth expressed, sometimes, &quot;the world is too much with us&quot;.  But let us hope that is a world of reason and not one of false imaginings that diminish us as human beings.<br />As a freethinker, I have attempted to test the process of reductionsim when it comes to the inherent benefits religious belief systems have provided to humanity since the first glimmerings of a need to understand the world around us, emerged in the human species. I have in my final analysis always found those belief sytems wanting and humanity none the better for their infliction upon us.  Thank you Wendy for enunciating more eloquently and humorously these views better than anyone I can recall in recent memory.  Even with her homeopathic confession...<br />If you're tired of being intellectually embarrassed by your faith in &quot;whatever&quot;, here's the antidote for nagging religious constipation.  If you're a recovering theist, and still have that urge for a little something, check out Deism, you'll be glad you did.  But my god, (pun intended) do something about that title!	2003-04-29

Hugo	I had heard of this book for sometime before actually reading it and when I finally ordered it and began my reading; I was off on the most amazing adventure of metaphysical ideas I've ever encountered. As a student of Spiritualism as well as the Alan Kardec inspired spiritualist philosophy known as Spiritism from a historical and sociological perspective, this book brings to life the intensity of those 19th century psychonauts who in living with human mortality in a much more immediate way than we do now, documents their explorations of one of the fundamental questions of existence- do we survive death.<br />And the answers to those pointed questions that were revealed to the Hugo circle during his period of exile from France are simply breathtaking. First is their sheer poetic verbal majesty, secondly in the intimations of a universal mind that is both the embodiment of that \\"love which steers the stars\\" of Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" to the impersonal karmic justice that minimizes the inflated human ego in the scheme of things.<br />I cannot recomend this book highly enough, it will remain with you for thought & contemplation long after you've finished the final page.	2003-04-17

With Christine Wicker's work contributing to our understanding with a fresh assessment of this spiritual heritage through the microcosm of the Lily Dale community. We discover the progressive movements enhanced and energized by those Victorian Spiritualists, for examples, the surprising number of Spiritualists who were active in the abolitionist movement, human rights movements, not just for anglo-saxons but all Americans regardless of race, and perhaps the progenitor in the struggle for the rights of women (no small achievement).  For the first time since ancient times, women were perceived as spiritual leaders &amp; role models rather than as silent, serving, disenfranchised members of a church congregation.  Through mediumship women tasted for the first time a role of respect and leadership within their communities and there was no turning back.<br />This book also serves as a spiritual diary of discovery for the author herself.  Her chapter recounting an encounter with the Dalai Lama is extremely profound and moving.  Observing the empowerment of women with low self-esteems and extremely difficult lives, that blossom through affiliation with the movement is insightful from a sociological perspective.  And the comfort for the bereaved which Spiritualism has offered since its inception is well illustrated in a non-sensational manner.<br />As with all religious/spiritual movements, we see the sublime as well as the ridiculous of human fraility at play with petty politics, back biting, artificial hierarchies, and the desire for power.  But at the conclusion of the book one comes away with a sense of the nobility of the human spirit both in this life and just maybe in the next...	2003-04-11

Especially new freethinkers who are still being warned by well intentioned \\"true believers\\" that an ethical, moral life is only possible with a personal deity.  Lookng back to the classical pagan world of stoicism, we find Seneca, a philosopher that continues to illuminate the world with insights into conducting ones life according to reason and the affirmation to all that life has to offer without resorting to false piety and religious apologetics.  These are views from the real world.<br /><br />Of interest to anyone examining the classical world of ancient Rome will discover, the intellectuals of the time possessed both a religion and a philosophy to guide their lives.  Religion was merely the outward exoteric public display of sentiment (much like our calendar holidays today) and then there was your philosophy, the inner esoteric moral compass that guided deep seated morality and ethical choices.  Which can result in a well lived life of fullfillment & happiness.  Qualities all too often absent from modern life.  Especially for those still trying to juggle and make sense of repressive monotheisms.  Read Seneca & celebrate life's rich offerings.	2003-03-25

Which to my mind stands as the classic textured literary time machine, that allows the reader to taste, touch, hear &amp; smell a bygone era in full measure.  Marrie Walsh has created a minor masterpiece with her (first?) book.  Not only will those devotees of the country life memoirs find similarities with Thompson, but also touches of Miss Read as well as WB Yeats and Thomas Hardy here.  The bitter as well as the sweet with a magical touch of folklife for good measure.  Highly recommended.  And may we see many more works from Ms Walsh's pen.	2003-03-25

If there is a nether world, then there must be a special place for those that create history to fit their egoic/selfish aims. Read any of the above authors to see how to rewrite history for your own agenda. But avoid them like the plague if you seek inner growth & fresh illumination.	2002-11-07

Though there have been recent disputes with some conclusions drawn by Dame Yates in this work, it still remains a pioneering document of historical research.  The recent collection of essays by Christopher Bamford, &quot;The Roscicrucian Enlightment Revisited&quot; goes toward validation of much of this work.  A seminal book in esoteric studies, highly recommended.	2002-08-09

However, as fond as I was of the first one based on folk & fairy tales. (see my review) I confess I was somewhat disappointed by this one, it lacked some of the sparkle and good humor that the first Little Lit book has.  The art is still creative & cutting edge, but the story lines were weak and not very engaging.  As a Kim Deitch fan, I was delighted to see his surreal paean to felines.  Buy it, if you want to collect the series.  But start with #1.  Be that as it may- I can't wait for #3 to appear!	2002-07-03

Thanks be for the bringing back of this ghostly masterpiece!  As a lifelong collector and devotee of ghost stories I find this collection to be one of the finest, most elegant collections I've read.  I have always felt a well written ghost story is among the finest examples of the beauty of the English language one can find.  And these are superlative examples of the genre.  Reading these on a &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; is a guarantee for a delicious shudder and a nervous glance over ones shoulder.	2002-01-16

I discovered and read &quot;Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; earlier this year.  And I cannot get it out of my head!  It's everything I ever wanted in a fantasy novel- ghosts, ghouls, occult philosophy, gypsies, romantic landscapes, murder &amp; mayhem, the Kabbalah and sex.  What more can a bibliophile want?  Treat yourself- get a copy as quickly as possible.  Though I prefer the Christine Donougher translation to Ian MacLean's.  She more successfully captures the surreal whimsy of the narrative that I feel was Potocki's intention.	2001-12-10

Yet as a theosophist I am fully aware of how K fits into into the overall historical scheme of Theosophy, and I find Aryel Sanat's book an attempt at esoteric historical revisionism. Interpreting K's relationship & role with the Theosophical Society as one of wish fullfilment on the author's part, rather than historical accuracy.  As a theosophist I really wanted to like this book, but I could not.  Because the author is attempting to create a role for K within the theosophical movement that simply cannot be validated by the facts.  K fully and completely sought to disengage himself from the occult nonsense & perversions thrust upon Theosophy by the Besant/Leadbeater gang, with all its aberations i.e. Liberal Catholicism, co-masonry, and all other ritualized psychic capers they attempted to infiltrate into Theosophy.  Completely undermining the original vision of Blavatsky's perrenial philosopy.  K's gift to humanity was a rational spirituality based on personal responsibility.  The K presented in this book is a false messiah of the authors imagination.	2001-05-11

Gurdjieff.  For those of us  keenly interested in the philosophy of Mr. Gurdjieff, you may find yourself  wanting more reflections on her remarkable Uncle and less on her joys and  tribulations of operating a bistro in London for many years.  Yet for those  who love the Gurdjieff Work, any stories and memories of that remarkable  social experiment known as the Priory, relish any memories of those heady  days.  And for this alone Luba's memoirs are enough.  Only Thomas &amp;  Olga deHartmann's &quot;Our Life With Mr. Gurdjieff&quot; comes as close to  providing that feeling of domesticity &amp; intimacy with the great man as  this book does. Moreover, she conveys an earthy appreciation &amp; savor of  life itself (very much her Uncle's neice)in her approach to feeding the  bodies and souls of those who came her way.  The cuisine is standard  European bistro fare, with the odd exception of corn on the cob! Her borsht  recipe is one of the best I've had, as well as her remembrance of her  Uncle's famous salad recipe is a joy to read.  This book is a delight for  both gourmet &amp; gourmand, but it's real quality is the warm, open  hospitality of the old world that shines in every page.	2000-08-23
