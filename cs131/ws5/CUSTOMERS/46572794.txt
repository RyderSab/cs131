Most books about British folk music, or about &#34;folk-rock&#34; (a term usually taken to mean an American genre of slightly earlier date) don't distinguish the electric folk bands or else relegate the whole idea to a corner.  But Sweers puts front and center four bands: Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, Pentangle, and the Oyster Band, with plenty of discussion of acoustic performers allied to electric folk (e.g. Martin Carthy, Shirley Collins) and some excursions into &#34;Celtic lounge music&#34; (Clannad, Enya) and American bands doing English electric folk.  Nor is this a casual anecdotal history.  Despite some occasionally sloppy writing and copyediting (what has happened to the OUP, anyway?), Sweers has delved deeply into primary sources and interviewed almost everybody, and written a good analysis of how the &#34;scene&#34; developed, what it meant to the people performing and listening to it (even discussing social class issues), and into what the music is actually like and how it got that way.  I especially appreciated the meaty technical sections, like the chart showing some of the unusual chord progressions that characterize these songs (Fairport's &#34;Tam Lin&#34;, for instance, is i-VII-III-i).  One might also learn a lot.  Every history and interview of these performers says that many of them came out of &#34;the folk clubs,&#34; obviously venues where folk music was performed, but Sweers is the first to actually describe these things.  It turns out that &#34;'venue' can actually be misleading, for the clubs were more like events - weekly meetings that were located in one of the small back rooms of a pub, easily missed by outsiders&#34; (p. 112).  Folk clubs tended to be run by people who took Ewan MacColl's every suggestion as iron-clad gospel, and thus were bastions for what Tom Lehrer once called &#34;the peculiar hard core who equate authenticity with charm.&#34;  Now one begins to understand why people like Tim Hart and Maddy Prior found them stultifying and sought a way out.  Sweers's interviewing and research were done around 1996-97 and the book is largely written from the perspective of that time period, although there's an epilogue dated 2003 when the text was finalized.  It's still a long enough perspective to tell the primary history of a movement whose golden age was 1969-75 but still carries on.  This is a pioneering secondary study of considerable value, to ethnomusicologists seeking uncharted fields to read about, and especially to anyone who actually likes the music.	2005-06-30

Garth's readings of the poems are sometimes disconnected, but overall it's a good job of sensibly linking Tolkien's life with his contemporarneous work, and an even better job of integrating his military service into the larger history of the war. <br /> <br />Garth lays out in more detail than Carpenter could the thesis that Tolkien's early work was written under influence from his school friends, all creative themselves, and that it coalesced into the Lost Tales mythology in response to the deaths of two of those friends in battle.  Though this is nominally a book about the war, the focus is really on that group of school friends. <br /> <br />Garth tries very hard to explain how and why Tolkien's creativity bloomed in the form it did, but I'm not sure how well he succeeds.  The friends remain collections of facts who never quite come to life, the early exposition jumps around bafflingly, and the detail remains overwhelming throughout.  But the interpretations are usually good, and the factual errors very few. <br /> <br />There's very little about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" here.  This Tolkien is still a very young writer, strongly stamped by war, still writing of coy and eerie fairies in archaic language.  If that's not the Tolkien you know, this may not be the best place to begin learning about him.  But Garth has done some excellent original research in Tolkien's roots.  This is an important book.	2004-08-08

It's written in such an elementary and stiff manner that one wonders if the beginner of the title is the author. The organization is good, and the plot summaries are not over-detailed. But though the prose is competent, it's horribly dull, and slides clumsily over Tolkien's themes. A full chapter details arguments against Tolkien without allowing a real defense of his principles. Bullet-point summaries, and definitions of a few tough words (like &quot;philology&quot; and &quot;feudalism&quot;) are provided.	2004-08-06

Anyone interested enough in Tolkien to want to read more like him should at least sample the medieval literature here.  It has much more to offer than the average post-Tolkien fantasy. <br /> <br />The problem lies in the fact that most of the works are given in <br />a) very old <br />b) prose <br />c) translations. <br /> <br />a) very old: done for copyright reasons, but unless there's no choice readers should read translations into their own idiom, and these century-old versions, although Tolkien often read them himself, are no longer in our idiom.  Translations of old works offer a bridge, but these bridges reach to the 19th century, not the 21st. <br /> <br />b) prose: some of the original works are in prose, of course, but many are verse.  The editor holds that complex medieval verse forms can be a stumbling block, and that a prose translation will at least give you the story.  I disagree.  If you ONLY want the story, read a retelling, not a translation.  A prose translation will have all the verbal complexity of the original, but without the verse forms that give structure to that complexity and allow it to make sense.  So it can be more of a stumbling block than a verse translation.  And prose translations can suck the life out of an original, but a good verse translation can be wonderful.  For Chaucer, for instance, don't read the prose translations here: get the vivid contemporary verse version by Nevill Coghill (a friend of Tolkien's, incidentally). <br /> <br />c) translations: Tolkien would prefer you read the original, or use the translation as a guide to reading the original (for this a prose translation of a poem can be better than verse, which must rearrange much).  Tolkien didn't think Old English or Old Norse were that difficult for an English-speaker, and even if he's wrong about that, at least a sample of the originals would have given some of their flavor, flavor which only comes through the original languages. <br /> <br />By all means try this book: it's a fine notion and a great convenience.  If you like these versions, well and good.  But if you don't, please don't be put off the literature that nourished Tolkien's imagination.  In either case, follow the editor's suggestions for further reading, and get retellings of old tales by Kevin Crossley-Holland and Roger Lancelyn Green, and modern verse translations of poems, including Coghill's Chaucer and Tolkien's own Sir Gawain and Pearl.	2004-08-06

Tolkien (SparkNotes Library of Great Authors)	Books	1	2	2	N	N	Plot summaries of Tolkien	This volume is from a Barnes & Noble house series in the style of Cliffs Notes. It consists mostly of detailed plot summaries, chapter by chapter, of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, together with weirdly detached and gratingly pompous summaries of each chapter's significance. &quot;He [Frodo] refuses to kill Gollum party because killing would pain him&quot; (p. 132). Pain whom, Frodo or Gollum? Lists of principal characters are just useless. But the book's greatest flaw is its attempt to link Tolkien to the primary world, in statements like &quot;Tolkien's Council of Elrond is fashioned after the United Nations&quot; (p. 92), or an unintentionally hilarious attempt to prove Tolkien unwordly by listing world events of the 1910s (why just that decade?) which he isn't known to have mentioned in letters (p. 7). Fortunately World War I isn't among them.	2004-08-06

To Rosebury, Tolkien has flaws but is a significant, though not great, literary figure with much to offer. His other work is also discussed, as is his place in literature. <br />  <br /> Most of his argument is that there is no excuse for critics to dismiss &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as a bestseller and therefore bad: it has the literary qualities in conception and narrative that these critics should be looking for and appreciating. <br />  <br /> Tom Shippey says much the same in &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century.&quot; But the books differ: Shippey is more concerned with broad cultural context, while Rosebury focuses more narrowly on the text as an object of literary art. He writes a cool analysis with only occasional touches of exasperation at wrong-headed criticism, where Shippey is a polemicist. <br />  <br /> Rosebury is equipped to tell critics why they should be reading Tolkien. Ane he does his telling in plain English, so we may all follow him and learn a great deal.	2004-08-06

As such, it's not bad.  As a guide to Tolkien's book, however, it's another matter.  The opening chapters on Tolkien and his work are actually pretty well-written and accurate.  But even they are loaded with movie photos; and a chapter on the characters mixes facts from the book and films indiscriminately.  A geography-ethnography chapter approaches David Day levels of plonky erroneousness.  Most offensive is page 102, a list of parts of the book deemed skippable, especially any poetry that might hold up the action.  If you want action, see the movie.

They shouldn't look like children next to the scholars in \\"Tolkien the Medievalist\\", \\"Tolkien's Legendarium\\", or \\"J.R.R. Tolkien and His Literary Resonances\\", but they do.  One expects them to do better than this, and to integrate their two subjects with subtlety instead of undergraduate bland awkwardness.  One author who'd not get a B is Scott A. Davison, who completely messes up his summary of Tom Shippey's subtle but clear perspective on the nature of evil in Tolkien, as expressed in his \\"The Road to Middle-earth\\" and \\"J.R.R.

The conference was sponsored by a C.S. Lewis Institute, and some contributions are reminiscent of the aggressive polemical style of that author's apologetics.  The opening two essays, by the editor and Peter Kreeft, are not concerned with discerning Tolkien's views of western civilization, but with using Tolkien to buttress their own views, a distinctly different approach.  And their definition of western civilization, for the purpose of their essays, is strictly confined to Biblical morality, with dire references to September 11 as proof of the reality of evil, and plenty of random bashings of anti-Tolkien critics, moral relativists, and other harbingers of the bad.  Kreeft claims that Theoden's virtue lay in avoiding Denethor's sin of acquiring too much knowledge, and that Gollum speaks in the plural because the singular, as in \\"I Am That I Am,\\" is associated with God.  Some may find such claims seriously off-base: I certainly do, and had to grit my teeth through both his and West's essays.    [Contrary to the anonymous reviewer above, examples like these are totally out of keeping with Tolkien's own way of thinking.  There are many better books, by scholars such as Joseph Pearce and Matthew Dickerson, which demonstrate Tolkien's Catholic and conservative thinking in terms of Tolkien's own thought, rather than using Tolkien as a cudgel to randomly bash whatever the writer may not like about modern life.  Tolkien was never crude, and unlike C.S. Lewis he was not a polemicist in his public writings.  These authors are both.]    The third and longest essay, by Janet Leslie Blumberg, is a quiet discussion of the literary influence on Tolkien of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature.  Three very brief essays conclude by taking a more specifically theological and sacramental approach to Tolkien's morality.  Of these, Phillip Goggans follows Kreeft and West, but Joseph Pearce and Kerry L. Dearborn are more interested in exploring Tolkien's views than in using Tolkien to defend their own.    [Again, note the difference.  They explore Tolkien's views, rather than selectively and misleadingly quoting from Tolkien to defend their own views, which on specific matters Tolkien might or might not have shared.]    They and Blumberg provide workmanlike essays which, though they only skim the surface of their topics, can be useful as introductions.    This book is a thin softcover with large print, narrow margins, and numerous typographical errors.	2003-12-20

These minimize literary interpretations in favor of mixing plot summaries with quotes from early reviews and (rather overly) detailed accounts of publication histories.  I suspect most of the facts in these last come, without specific credit, from Wayne G. Hammond's bibliography.  Bramlett is elsewhere prone to omitting references, e.g. in discussing the origin of Ancrene Wisse, a Middle English text Tolkien studied extensively.  I don't consider this a plagiarism issue, but an omission of an opportunity to send interested readers off for more information.  This is not a scholarly book by any means, but it doesn't claim to be one.  Bramlett's selective and annotated bibliography of works on Tolkien is nice to have, and an attached discography is even nicer.  There's also a chapter of ruminative personal reflections by Joe R. Christopher.  A few factual errors are regrettable: Bramlett gets the LotR copyright issue completely wrong, and writes that Ancrene Wisse came from Hertfordshire where he means Herefordshire, not the same place at all.	2003-12-20

Perry calls LOTR's Appendix B, the Tale of Years, \\"far from complete\\" but it covers the whole period: what he means is that it's not detailed enough for him.  Appendix B won't tell you which day Sam cooked coney for Frodo; Perry will.<br />But alas, the book does not stop there.  The entries are written as bullet lists like a PowerPoint presentation, and many add pointless little flowcharts such as two-generation family trees.  They reduce Tolkien's magnificently complex subcreation into a giant mass of undifferentiated trivia.  And each yearly or daily entry comes with its commentary, whether directly relevant, side points, broader considerations, or dogmatic essays in applicability.  The unrelieved banality and inappropriateness of these must be read to be believed; as also the author's clumsy, grammatically inept style, and his smug superiority to the characters.  (He frequently criticizes the good guys' \\"blunders,\\" all of them more complex than he implies.)<br />There's actually some good chronological analysis and speculation hiding in here.  But how can someone who knows his Tolkien that well say that the wizards were Valar, or that Rohan gave Isengard to Saruman (it wasn't theirs to give, and Saruman was made its warden, not a freeholder), that Boromir and Faramir had a sibling rivalry (Tolkien specifically says not), or suggest that Galadriel should have sent daily eagles to check up on the Fellowship?<br />These are not isolated examples: the bloopers and misconceived ideas go on and on.  The whole book is like that: it has the soul of a PowerPoint presentation.  I can't recommend it on any terms.	2003-12-20

Tolkien: Author of the Century&quot; places Tolkien in the context of his time.  &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot; has the more scholastically challenging job of placing Tolkien in the context of his tradition.  As that tradition is primarily philological and philosophical, these are his subjects.  He tells us what Tolkien meant the words and names in his stories to mean; he tells us how Tolkien used modern language to convey modern and ancient styles and philosophies in contrast; he tells us how the Ring mediates two mutually exclusive concepts of evil; he explains Tolkien's complex narrative strategies; he dresses down critics who misunderstand Tolkien and blame him for not fitting into their concepts of literature; and he does all this with such a blistering display of erudition and general intelligence that the reader sits back amazed.<br />The book is discursive, and the opening theoretical chapters may seem heavy going, but have patience: they provide necessary context.  Shippey has Tolkien's measure in full throughout.  He explains what was important to Tolkien, what Tolkien thought he was doing, and - no less vitally - why it is necessary to understand this if one is not to bash Tolkien in annoyance for not accomplishing something totally different.<br />If you read Shippey, will you necessarily understand Tolkien?  No.  But if you don't read Shippey, and if you also don't have his insight and knowledge, you will not fully understand Tolkien.	2003-12-20

It also falsifies Tolkien's subcreation to treat it so dogmatically.  This book, like Michael Perry's \\"Untangling Tolkien\\" and Michael Stanton's \\"Hobbits, Elves and Wizards\\" before it, is all \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and a little \\"Silmarillion\\"; it doesn't engage with \\"The History of Middle-earth\\" at all.  The obligatory cartoons by Rich Tennant are amusing, though Patrick Wynne could have done much better, both in art and humor.<br />Fortunately Harvey has a better grip on the internal facts of Middle-earth than either Perry or Stanton, his speculations though somewhat wayward are less voluminous than Perry's, and he's also by far the best writer of the three.  So this book will do the reader very little harm, especially as nobody to whom its facts would be plot spoilers could possibly get through its doggedness.  Harvey does shine in his final chapter, where he lists ten differences between the book and the first two Jackson films, astutely noting how these affect characterization and plot emphasis.	2003-12-20

The revised edition is not a quick touch-up, but a massively extended rewrite that delves into much more detail and takes into account much that had not been published in 1983.  Even the remainder of the old book has been re-written to improve clarity and flow.  Along with Flieger's second Tolkien study, A Question of Time, which does for time and dreams what this one does for language and light, Splintered Light resumes its place as one of the half-dozen essential critical monographs on Tolkien.

But the appeal of Tolkien's original Wilderland map lies in its busy detail, and Howe's open wash from a receding perspective seems rather vacant.  My wife the musician immediately started critiquing the bowing styles of the dwarf musicians in the framing illustration.<br />The other volume has four independent and well-written essays by Sibley discussing the origin of each original map and the place of geography in each story, plus a gazetteer of each land.<br />I'd recommend this for the commentary, or if you want to pin the maps as posters on your wall.  If you have the original books, you don't need these maps, but they do make nice posters.	2003-12-20

Tolkien	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Outdated but essential	The author is deceased, and the text has never been altered since its original publication in 1972, so some of its facts are outdated.  But the bulk of the book remains insightful and useful: nothing published since has invalidated Kocher's discussion of the moral stances and the nature of evil shown in LotR.  He also provides the best analysis ever published of the character of Aragorn, and what are still the only studies of the rare poems \\"The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun\\" and \\"Imram\\".  But it would have been nice to have added a footnote saying that \\"Imram\\" is now easily available in its original context (unknown to Kocher) of The Notion Club Papers (in Sauron Defeated, p. 296-9).	2003-12-20

A reliable source but a very poor second choice to Robert Foster's Complete Guide to Middle-earth (less detail, more omissions, few dates, hardly any page references), Tyler's tome now includes entries from Unfinished Tales, 24 years after that book was published.  It ignores almost everything else since then, whether it fits into the (illusory) \\"final\\" legendarium or not.  Tyler claims he's dropped his pretence that Middle-earth is real, but entries like that for Orcs, identifying them as the true origin of mythic goblins, show that he hasn't.  This new edition is only worth having if a copy drops into your lap.	2003-12-20

It has a 14-page potted biography and a 15-page C-grade freshman essay on the meaning of his work, framing sixty full pages on Tolkien and film.  This staggeringly detailed central essay carefully recounts every single attempt, however abortive, to put Tolkien on film, and is thorough enough to list all the other fantasy film credits of everyone even remotely involved in any of these efforts.  Did you know that the actor who voiced Sam Gamgee in the Bakshi film was cast as &quot;Boy in bed&quot; in something called &quot;Sweeney 2&quot;?  You'll learn that gripping piece of film trivia here.  You'll learn who Peter Jackson _didn't_ cast, and what their film credits are, also.  At the end of the book, a desultory annotated bibliography tries to recommend the posthumous books but ends up describing them as &quot;confusing and overwhelming.&quot;  The authors only really get excited in this chapter when they reach the section on gaming.  This is a book for film fans and gaming fans whose only passing interest in Tolkien is that he wrote the book that served as the basis for what they really like.	2002-05-01

Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'	Books	3	23	26	N	N	For people who already know LOTR backwards & forwards ONLY!!	This book comes across as the ultimate college English term paper on Tolkien: all the basic lit-class analysis you could possibly want.  Prof. Stanton has been teaching Tolkien to undergraduates for many years, and the voice of this book is that of the competent but uninspired freshman-lit teacher, analytically keen but prone to overgeneralization, and hazier than he thinks in his grasp of the facts in a complex novel.<BR>Normally I'd be the last person to object to intelligent scholarly analysis.  But this well-meaning book shows the harm it can do.  Stanton is so diligent in ferreting out the subtlest threads and connections from =LotR= and laying them out clearly that he sucks all the life out of them, leaving them drab and dead on the page, and denying readers the joy and the vividness of discovering them for themselves.<BR>Stanton makes several good points, and has observed many obscure connections and even loose ends in =LotR=, but that doesn't keep him from stating questionable facts, often through overgeneralization, or highly doubtful interpretations, on almost every page.  A good example is his statement that mellifluous languages are spoken by good people and harsh, guttural languages are spoken by bad people.  This claim is usually made with the intent (which is not Stanton's) of denigrating Tolkien, and it's not true anyway (what about Dwarvish?).<BR>This book, despite its good points, should on no account be read by anyone who's just finished =LotR= for the first or even second time, and the true newcomer shouldn't even glance in its direction.  It should only be read by those with a deep experience and knowledge of =LotR=, who won't be spoiled by it but might still learn something; and, perhaps, by English lit students desperate for term paper topics the night before the deadline.	2002-02-22

For that you'd be better advised to turn to Joseph Pearce's =Tolkien: A Celebration=.  Instead, it's a collection of brief essays or sermons in the form of Christian theological and ethical homilies on texts (or more accurately themes) taken from =LotR=, pretty much in chronological order.  The lesson is how Tolkien's characters can serve as models for a Christian life and ethical behavior.  The authors write in a traditional sermon style, and as is typical of sermons they quickly leave the text behind, moving to Biblical parallels and broader considerations which the texts inspire or exemplify.<BR>What theis essentially Protestant books mostly leave out of their discussion of Tolkien's Catholic work is consideration of the roles of worship, iconography and symbolism, and holy awe in =LotR=.  But though selective, it does not distort.  Unlike someone's aborted attempt to teach the business secrets of Tolkien's characters, at least these lessons fit.  For Tolkien studies, the main value is the demonstration that his characters =are= ethical, and that ethics were thus basic to the author.  Sermons like these could not easily be written on many other fantasy novels.	2002-02-22

This is the first trade paperback of Foster's classic guide.  Its page references have always been to the Ballantine paperbacks; new typesettings of =LotR= have given this edition three sets of page references, making it a bit hard to use.  A cross-reference table to the old hardcovers is retained, but newer typesettings of the hardcovers are not mentioned.  Or I think not: unless I missed it, the book doesn't actually say what editions the new page references are to.  Still, Foster remains the most essential book about Tolkien's world by someone other than Tolkien himself.	2002-02-22

For that you'd be better advised to turn to Joseph Pearce's =Tolkien: A Celebration=.  Instead, it's a collection of brief essays or sermons in the form of Christian theological and ethical homilies on texts (or more accurately themes) taken from =LotR=, pretty much in chronological order.  The lesson is how Tolkien's characters can serve as models for a Christian life and ethical behavior.  Smith sticks closer to the plot of =LotR= in his discussions than Bruner and Ware do.  He has a less sure grasp of Tolkien's moral implications, however, and says a few odd things: he commends Gandalf's self-sacrifice in Moria but at the same time implicitly criticizes him by noting that \\"wise generals lead from the rear,\\" a lesson of tactics but not of ethics.<BR>What both these essentially Protestant books mostly leave out of their discussion of Tolkien's Catholic work is consideration of the roles of worship, iconography and symbolism, and holy awe in =LotR=.

US	46572794	R85VILL9ZOOWC	0028642856	327917606	The Life and Work of J.R.R. Tolkien ( Critical Lives )	Books	1	15	15	N	N	A bounteous source of error and misinterpretation	This is the third full-length biography of Tolkien, after Humphrey Carpenter's and Daniel Grotta's.  Carpenter's is accurate, well-written, and insightful.  Grotta's is none of these, and White's reminds me much of Grotta's.  The writing is abysmally clunky, and the text is riddled with completely amateur factual errors on every level, from confusing Dorothy Sayers with Dorothy Parker to inflating Tolkien's discomfort with Charles Williams's work into a seething personal hatred for which there is no contemporary evidence: rather the opposite.  White's task, as the title suggests, was to analyze Tolkien's work as well as to recount his life, but there is no literary criticism as such in this book.  White starts off his analysis badly by declaring that &quot;the published letters relate almost nothing of his private life,&quot; which could only be thought true by someone disappointed at not finding the &quot;personal demons&quot; and &quot;inner drives&quot; (his words) that he thinks Tolkien ought to have.  Accordingly, he supplies them.  For instance, White reduces Tolkien's motivation for writing his mythology into a simple Freudian longing for his lost mother, and then adds insult to injury by claiming that this oversimplification takes nothing away from Tolkien's achievement.  White shows no understanding of what made Tolkien tick, and replaces him with a textbook psychological construct.<BR>Parts of the book are not this bad.  White is less digressive than Grotta, and he shows at least a minimal knowledge of Tolkien's posthumously-published works.  He concludes with a rousing defense of the value of Tolkien's work, but doesn't really engage with the criticisms.  Against elitists who half-believe that popularity is a sign of worthlessness, it's no reply to emphasize Tolkien's popularity.<BR>At one point White criticizes Tolkien for objecting to errors in a publisher's blurb.  Tolkien didn't understand the publisher's publicity needs, White says.  But no publisherneeds to be factually inaccurate, and neither do Tolkien's biographers.  This book is likely to be a source of factual and interpretive error for years to come.  It adds nothing useful to Carpenter's biography, the one book all persons curious about Tolkien's life should read.	2002-02-22

Feist, Terry Pratchett, Charles de Lint, George R. R. Martin, and more	Books	3	19	20	N	N	Authors gush over Tolkien	Easily found and bearing a highly illustrious cast, this book presents fifteen noted fantasy authors, plus scholar Douglas A. Anderson and artists Tim and Greg Hildebrandt, expressing what they get out of Tolkien.  It's a change from listening to authors hawk their own work on convention panels.<BR>Despite the obligatory &quot;how I discovered Tolkien&quot; anecdotes, which can be annoying in such quantity (I often find them charming, myself), the contributors avoid much repetition.  A few simply burble, trying unsuccessfully to be amusing.  Several discuss how Tolkien's example freed them to write their own kind of fantasy: Poul Anderson's juxtaposition of =LotR= with his own =Broken Sword=, and Harry Turtledove's bashful confession of his early life as a naked Tolkien imitator, are the most notable.  Others try to analyze the reasons for Tolkien's popularity, but with less success: that's a skill of critics, not of authors.  But a few, including Raymond E. Feist and Terri Windling, have some good points to make along the way.  The best essays are by those who do have it in them to be critics.  Douglas A. Anderson is here to remind us that Tolkien wrote other books besides =LotR= and =The Hobbit=, and to warn us of the perils of undiscriminating popularity.  Michael Swanwick offers a brief but thoughtful character study.  Slightly less elevated than these is Orson Scott Card's diatribe against symbolic analysis: my instinct is to agree, but I finish the essay thinking there's points to be made for the other view.  The outstanding contribution is Ursula K. Le Guin's: she simply sits down, as a good author with an ear for style can, and =demonstrates= Tolkien's quality by analyzing his use of rhythm, recurrence, and opposition to create emotional effects in a sample chapter of =LotR=, &quot;Fog on the Barrow-Downs&quot;.<BR>The authors make few factual errors, but the book offers many typos, including a character named Owyn.  Illustrations by John Howe brighten a fewpages.	2002-02-22

The cozy, smarmy tone and false sense of intimacy (leading Coren into many errors, though not as many as Michael White's =Life and Work of J.R.R. Tolkien=) make this book painful reading.  Like all other juvenile biographies of Tolkien, or of C.S. Lewis (another subject Coren has essayed), this is entirely outclassed by adult offerings.  Any child capable of appreciating =LotR= enough to desire a biography of the author can handle Humphrey Carpenter's classic book, and should.	2002-02-22

This is unfortunate: Chance's work has some merit, but she is a dull, foggy writer, with a bent towards political and Freudian analysis alien to Tolkien's thought.  Both books are analyses, not introductions.  This one is a general survey of Tolkien's fiction published through =The Silmarillion=.  It's been updated with many new references to later scholarship (not always summarized correctly), but there's very little on \\"The History of Middle-earth\\" or any other of Tolkien's more recently published fiction.  =Tolkien's Art= remains a book from 1979, with none of the change of context its subject demands: to discuss \\"Imram\\" today without tucking in a single reference to =The Notion Club Papers=, from which it's excerpted, is inexcusable.  I cannot recommend either of these very highly.	2002-02-22
