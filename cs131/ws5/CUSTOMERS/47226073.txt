US	47226073	R3JVKHPJQZ5AQ	1569245460	293063231	The First Year Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed	Books	4	21	26	N	N	Great info - strong on food & exercise - weak on emotions	It says on the cover that Gretchen Becker is a magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Radcliffe College with four years of graduate study in biology at Harvard, and a writer and editor specializing in medical books.<br /><br />And she writes like it.  If you learned everything in this book, The First Year, you would know more about Type 2 Diabetes than 90% of doctors.  Which is to say, there's a lot more information than anyone needs.  However, there is a lot of good stuff on eating, exercising, and glucose testing, and it will help you get started with making changes you want to make to protect your health.<br /><br />On what to eat, Becker gives a good description of all the major diabetes diets, and says different ones work better for different people, and it should be your choice which to try, which is true.  She seems to lean towards a low-carb approach, which I also think is correct.  She gives some very good advice on how to start and keep up an exercise program.  I like the fact that she suggests other ideas besides walking - especially her take on weightlifting, which can be very effective.<br /><br />First Year is weaker on issues of stress, emotions, and social support.  Most of her advice on getting social support involves using the Internet.  I guess this makes sense for a health writer and editor who lives in small-town Vermont and spends most of her waking hours at a computer, but most of us will probably do better connecting in person.  Social support from family, friends, and other people with diabetes is key to coping with chronic illness, as I point out in my first book, The Art of Getting Well.  And there are skills, attitudes, and strategies that are crucial in getting support, which Becker doesn't mention.<br /><br />Her section on depression is also weak.  She only talks about depression caused by diabetes, and ignores the many life causes of depression that can contribute to diabetes in the first place.  Her stress stuff is a little confusing.  She calls heavy eating a stress, and says the same about other behaviors.  She says long-term emotional stress doesn't affect sugars much, but seems unaware of the effects of long-term economic and social stress.  These are some of the subject of my new book.  The Politics of Diabetes, which will be out by the end of the year (hopefully.)<br /><br />Where we do agree is that diabetes is not the fault of the person who has it. Her first chapter is called Not Your Fault, which is also in the first chapter of my book.  But we disagree on whose fault it actually is.  She says it's all in the genes. Genes certainly play a role, but environment is much more important, and she lets the modern social environment off the hook completely.<br /><br />Why has the rate of type 2 diabetes gone up 400% in the last 30 years?  And why do poor people get so much more diabetes than rich people? Why do African Americans and Native Americans have the highest rates of diabetes in the world?  Africans in Africa don't have much diabetes, so it's not primarily the genes.<br /><br />I say that diabetes is caused by a toxic environment, full of sugar, stress, inequality and inactivity.  Those who lack the power to fight off the environment are at risk for diabetes.  The First Year gives very good advice on managing diabetes and living well with it.  But I suspect that most readers will have difficulty carrying out her program, because the difficulties of their lives will get in the way.  These are often the same difficulties that contribute to T2D in the first place.  To deal with diabetes, we need to change our environment and increase our power.<br /><br />People need to build the power to eat healthy food when surrounded by toxic foods that taste good.  We need power to move our bodies when our lives are set up to enforce inactivity.  We need power to relax in a life filled  with stresses and dangers.  Most of all, we need the power to love ourselves when society does not seem to love us, and to take care of ourselves when so many other demands compete for our time.<br /><br />It's OK that The First Year doesn't deal much with emotional issues or practical life issues.  The main thing is that you'll get a lot of valuable information.  There will also be a lot that you want to skip, most likely.  The daily, weekly, then monthly structure of the First Year series doesn't add much, in my opinion. The only way you'll get the first few days in a timely manner is if you doctor gives it you when you get diagnosed.  And later on, the breaking up into months doesn't really make much sense.  Chapter titles would have worked just as well.<br /><br />I do recommend this book if you have diabetes.  There are probably others that might work better for you, though.  You might also be interested in my books for a different perspective.her demands compete for our time.

Zebras don't get ulcers because<br /><br />a) when they're stressed (like by a lion), they run like hell, and<br /><br />b) when they're not in danger, they don't worry about the next lion.  They relax.<br /><br />But it's still worth reading this book.  It's full of fascinating stories and offbeat humor.  It's filled with a spirit of compassion for all people and animals who deal with too much stress.  And it gives the best explanation I've ever read of how prolonged, chronic stress affects our bodies and minds. I wish I had read it before writing my first book, The Art of Getting Well.<br /><br />Sapolsky explains that stress is not the enemy.  Without the stress response, none of us would be alive.  But when it goes on too long, and when we aren't able to relieve stress by physical action, it raises our blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, tends to make us fat, damage our memories and derange our immune systems.<br /><br />Unlike most pop science writers, Sapolsky acknowledges the social and economic causes of stress.  He doesn't just say, \\"Relax!\\"  But he does point to some ways people can cope with stressful environments.  Since most of our stresses don't involve hungry lions, we often have a choice in how we interpret threats and how we respond.  We can, to a certain extent, use our minds and bodies to reduce the effect of environmental stressors.<br /><br />Stress contributes greatly to Type 2 Diabetes; some would say stress causes it.  I talk about this a lot in my upcoming books, \\"The Politics of Diabetes\\" and \\"Diabetes as a Turning Point.\\"  Stress is not evenly distributed through our society.  Money protects you from stress, as does education, social support, love, and self-confidence.  While we can't always do much about the money, my book does explain how we can use the power of other people and positive emotions to manage both stress and diabetes.

His work has inspired a lot of progress on the social causes of illness. I will use some of his material to explain the connection between stress and diabetes in my new book, \\"Diabetes as a Turning Point.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not find \\"The End of Stress as We Know It\\" to be as valuable as the research that inspired it.  It's pretty dryly scientific, a lot of \\"studies show this,\\" and \\"studies show that,\\" without many examples or stories to illustrate his points.  He says we can do a lot to prevent stress-related illness, but mainly repeats \\"low-fat diet, exercise, and social support\\" as his advice.  These may be useful suggestions, but people would need a lot more specifics to be able to use them effectively in our toxic environment.  Those are the kind of suggestions they'll get from my book.<br /><br />The main new point here is the terms Dr. McEwen coined to replace the word stress.  He talks instead about \\"allostasis\\" to mean our bodies' natural stress response, and \\"allostatic load\\" to mean the problems that arise when the response gets overloaded.  Some social scientists have started using these terms, because the term \\"stress\\" does mean a lot of different things.  But this new terminology, IMO, does not require a whole book to explain it.<br /><br />I'm grateful to Dr. McEwen for his important research.  His book is worthwhile, but there's nothing here that isn't done better in Robert Sapolsky's Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers.<br /><br />David Spero RN, author of The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness  (Hunter House 2002).<br /><br />Nurse at davidsperoRN dot com	2005-04-19

If we can't or won't say \\"no\\" to some of them, our bodies may say no for us, by getting sick or even dying.  This is not a new idea. Many healers have taught it, and many books, including my own \\"Art of Getting Well\\" have described it.<br /><br />But Gabor Mate explains it better than anyone, with powerful scientific evidence and moving stories to back it up.  This Vancouver physician and health writer gives us the latest research on how emotions, thoughts, the nervous system, immune system and hormones work together to create health or illness.  He interviewed more than 100 patients with various conditions, and he shows how always giving in to others and denying our own wants and needs makes us vulnerable to a wide variety of illness.<br /><br />If you or someone you love is living with an autoimmune disease, an inflammatory condition, or cancer, you may find this book powerful and healing. If you are a health professional looking for better ways to help people with these \\"incurable\\" illnesses, you may find it here.  If you just want to know more about body and mind and how they work, if you want to be entertained and moved, this book is for you.  I wouldn't necessarily say buy it INSTEAD of Art of Getting Well, but they're complementary, and they're both great reading.<br /><br />At times, I felt that Dr. Mate must have read my diary.  The stories he tells of people with multiple sclerosis, ALS and other autoimmune diseases all sounded familiar.  I'm pretty sure that my own inability to say no - to be open about my own fears and desires - contributed to my MS, although there were many other causes.<br /><br />Gabor Mate sees the big picture-the combination of genes, physical and social environment, stresses and behaviors that lead to health problems.  He doesn't blame us for not standing up for ourselves.  He understands and explains the family dynamics and social forces that make it hard to say \\"No,\\" even when our lives depend on it.  He says, \\"Personality does not cause disease.  Stress does.  If we speak of a disease-prone personality, it is only in the sense that certain traits - in particular, the repression of anger - increase the amount of stress.\\"<br /><br />He knows, for example, that many of us feel guilty when we say no to others' demands, and he wants us get over it. He says, \\"For many people, guilt is a signal that they have chosen to do something for themselves. If you face a choice between feeling guilt and feeling resentful, choose the guilt every time.  Resentment is soul suicide.\\"<br /><br />I had read a lot on PNI, or psychoneuroimmunology, the science of mindbody medicine.  But I never understood exactly how these organs and cells all communicated and worked together until I read When The Body Says No.  Mate has a gift for explaining difficult concepts in simple language.  You will learn a lot, even if you don't completely buy the central idea.<br /><br />A couple of criticisms - I wish he had written more about economic and political factors that make saying no difficult. The less power you have, the harder it is to protect yourself. Obviously, you can't say no if you're a slave.  I write about the power aspects of disease in my new book, The Politics of Diabetes (out in 2006).<br /><br />But a lot of people have lost their power not by being severely oppressed, but by things that happened to them in their childhood, even their infancy.  There may be things we can do to reclaim some of our power and regain the freedom to say no.  We may help ourselves heal in this way.<br /><br />\\"When the Body Says No\\" is strong on these issues but doesn't give a lot of advice on what to do about them. The last chapter, the 7 A's of healing, provides some hints.  The A's are Acceptance, Awareness, Anger, Autonomy, Attachment, Assertion, and Affirmation.  Most of these get fairly short introductions, but I found the section on anger extremely valuable.  Anger can be a life-giving force, or it can be a killer if suppressed or acted out as rage.  We need to get in touch with the energy of anger and use it to empower ourselves and make needed changes. The other A's could have used some fleshing out, in my opinion.<br /><br />As someone who has been immersed in mindbody medicine personally and professionally for 20 years, I recommend this book to all of you.  It has meant more to me than anything I have read in this area for a long time.<br /><br />David Spero RN.  [...]on on anger extremely valuable.

Her concept of \\"sugar sensitivity\\" and her 7-step treatment plan will enable readers to understand and recover from addiction to foods, drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes.  People who have failed repeatedly at sobriety or weight loss can succeed with this plan, as thousands have already.<br /><br />Kathleen des Maisons learned about the importance of sugar through her work as a drug and alcohol treatment counselor.  She was having the usual low success rate in helping people stay off alcohol.  Then she discovered how certain foods lead to addiction to alcohol and drugs, as well as being addictive themselves.<br />She found that nearly all alcoholics lived largely on pasta, white breads and sweet things.  She knew what they were suffering. Her own father drank himself to death at age 51, and she herself weighed 240 pounds and had had problems with drinking.  When she discovered the benefits of a diet high in protein and vegetables for herself, she started using it with her clients.  Her success rates soared, even with the hardest cases.<br />She realized that addictive behavior has a lot to do with food, and that sugar was the primary culprit.  She believes that some people are born \\"sugar-sensitive,\\" which means they don't have enough serotonin or beta-endorphin in their brains.  Serotonin and beta-endorphin make us feel secure, stable, confident, cheerful.  If you have low levels of these chemicals, you are likely to feel badly.<br />Sugar and alcohol raise your serotonin and beta-endorphin levels. So they make you feel better and more energetic, especially if your levels were low to start with.  Unfortunately, eating concentrated sugars or refined carbohydrates causes a rebound effect.  Your sugars levels drop quickly, you feel worse than before, and you need more sugar, caffeine or alcohol to pick back up.<br />Pretty soon you're addicted. You feel alternately great and miserable.  The sugar swings stress your adrenal glands.  You blame yourself for being out of control and unfocused, for putting on weight or drinking, but actually it's the sugar.  It's a physical problem, although emotions do play a part.<br />Getting off sugar is difficult.  Our food supply is awash in sugars and simple carbs.  They can't be avoided.  Des Maisons gives us a practical strategy based on 12-step recovery programs.  Her seven steps are<br />1. Keep a food journal every day<br />2. Eat three meals a day at regular intervals<br />3. Take Vitamin C, B complex, and zinc<br />4. Eat enough protein at each meal<br />5. Move from simple to complex carbohydrates, or from \\"white foods\\" to \\"brown\\" and \\"green\\" foods.  \\"Brown\\" refers to things like whole grains and beans.  \\"Green\\" means vegetables, of whatever color.<br />6. Reduce or eliminate sugars (including alcohol)<br />7. Create a plan for maintenance.<br />She doesn't spell out a diet or recommend a lot of supplements or medications.  She says that, using her steps, each person can figure out for herself what is best for her body to eat.  She wants you to go through the 7 steps slowly, not to get impatient and rush ahead.  The idea is to build a better relationship with your body and with food, to learn how food relates to your physical and emotional feelings.<br /><br />Des Maisons writes with a compassion that comes from living with sugar addiction herself.  Chapter 3 is called, \\"It's Not Your Fault.\\"  (I also use that title in my book, \\"The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.\\") Her plan is based on \\"abundance, not deprivation.\\"  This means you focus more on adding good things (foods, exercise, prayer, pleasure etc), rather than giving things up. She keeps telling us to be gentle with ourselves, to focus on \\"progress, not perfection.\\"  She also has a great sense of humor and an apparent affection for potatoes.<br />\\"Potatoes notProzac\\" also gives a very clear explanation of the biochemistry of addiction.  She explains how serotonin and beta-endorphin are produced, get to the brain, and are regulated there, and how our food affects all those processes.  She cites more than 50 studies in support of her ideas, although most of them are animal studies.<br />I disagree with Des Maisons on a couple of points. I don't think sugar-sensitivity is all in your genes.  Your early environment, including the environment in your mother's uterus, makes a big difference.  Also, I'm pretty sure that too much stress or too sugary a diet at any time in your life can create sugar-sensitivity or something very much like it.<br />I would have liked to see more on why, where, and how to get help.  She mentions the need for support several times, but doesn't give much specific advice on finding it or asking for it.  Reading The Art of Getting Well or Cheri Register's \\"The Chronic Illness Experience\\" will give you those skills.  I also would have liked to see more on exercise.  Des Maisons pretty much just says, \\"go do it!\\"  Hopefully, that will be good enough for you, because physical activity is just as important as diet change, in my experience.<br />But these are small complaints.  The author's brilliant insights into sugar and addiction, her clear explanations of difficult concepts, her simple but effective treatment plan, and her generous and positive spirit make this book a treasure that can help with a wide variety of health and life issues.

The First Fat Fiction Anthology	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Too many suffering characters	The blurb at the top of the jacket says, \\"Here is fat in all its glory and grandeur - a large-hearted celebration of the human spirit and each individual's unique value, regardless of size.\\"<br />But it isn't. I was hoping for some proud, in-your-face fat people who believed in themselves.  But nearly all the fat characters in this story collection are miserable, and some are tragic.  The only contented one is a cat.<br />Some of the stories are marvelously written.  Junot Diaz' \\"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\\" paints an amazingly colorful picture of the culture of young Dominicans in New Jersey.  And Rhoda Stamell's \\"Love for a Fat Man,\\" set in a public health clinic in poverty-stricken Detroit, is one of the few stories where people change in positive ways. But several others, including S.L. Wisenberg's \\"Big Ruthie Imagines Sex Without Pain,\\" present people with too much self-hatred to identify with or enjoy.<br />Perhaps I was looking for something that doesn't exist.  I'm not heavy myself. I regard overweight as a health condition, not a character flaw.  I have a chronic condition myself, multiple sclerosis.  But unlike overweight people, I get sympathy for my problem, not blame.  I interviewed several overweight people for my book, \\"The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness\\" (Hunter House 2002).  Even though some of them are very fit aerobics instructors, most have a lot of self-doubt.  I don't know if society put it there, or if there's something else about being heavy that hurts your self-esteem.  Anyway, the protagonists in these stories are mostly damaged.<br />It's worth reading, though.  There are more poems than stories.  I very much liked J.L. Haddaway's \\"When Fat Girls Dream.\\" I think this book could start a lot of valuable discussion about weight and society's attitude towards it.<br />David Spero RN, author of \\"The Art of Getting Well.\\"  Write \\"david at davidsperorn.com\\"	2004-03-18

We all knew that, but Shawn Talbott explains some of the biochemistry of stress in layman's terms.  After reading The Cortisol Connection, you will know WHY chronic stress is bad and what it's likely to do to you.<br />Much of this has been covered better in other books about stress, such as Robert Sapolsky's Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. What's new about Cortisol Connection is the strong evidence that stress makes you gain weight.  It puts on fat and makes your cells resistant to insulin, which puts you at risk for diabetes.<br />I'm very interested in this, because I'm currently researching a new book called The Politics of Diabetes. (I should also admit that Hunter House, publisher of Cortisol Connection, also published my first book, The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.)  I found Talbott's work helpful.<br />What I did not find, though, was many good ideas for what to DO about stress.  He mentions stress reduction and exercise, but he seems to believe these are not realistic goals for most of us in our fast-paced society.  Nearly all his recommendations are for food supplements - vitamins, herbs, minerals, amino acids - over 50 in all.  And he really doesn't prioritize among them.  I still have no idea where to start with these supplements, which ones have strong supporting evidence and which don't.<br />I also found his reference list really aggravating.  I like to check references, both to learn more and to confirm that the author is playing straight with the facts.  Talbott combines all the references for the first five chapters (six pages of references) into one long list, without numbers.  So there's no way to tell which reference goes with which paragraph or claim in the book.  The supplements actually have many more references than the information on stress does.<br />So if you are inclined to seek health through supplements, this may be the stress book for you.  If you don't like investigating supplement claims and prowling around health food stores, you can still get some good information about stress here, but that's about it.<br />David Spero RN, author of The Art of Getting Well, Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.

They take the social movement against smoking as a model and call on us all to get involved, for our own sake and our children's.<br />This book is extremely well-referenced, drawing on scientific articles, popular journalism and books like Fast Food Nation.  Brownell and Horgen reveal the huge scope of America's problem with weight and tell how the problem is spreading all over the world.  They show how the food industry has penetrated schools, government agencies, and entertainment media to market sugary, fatty foods to adults and children.<br />Brownell is especially concerned about children, who lack the power to defend themselves against food advertising and easily available sweets.  He demolishes the \\"personal responsibility\\" argument used by the calorie pushers.  How can children be expected to say \\"no\\" to food that tastes good, is readily available in their schools and communities, is recommended by their favorite media characters or sports stars, and which nobody is warning them against?<br />The authors give dozens of suggestions for social changes that could increase physical activity (ex. bike paths), reduce soft drink consumption (ex a small tax that would go to fund nutrition education and provision of healthy school lunches), and make healthy food more available (a problem for a very large number of people in America.)  They also have lots of good suggestions for political activism.<br />What &quot;Food Fight&quot; does not include is strategies for individuals and families to protect themselves and live healthier lives.  That's not what the book is about - it's about the politics of food, and how we can change the environment so that healthy living becomes easier.<br />The writing style is clear, although not especially entertaining.  But there is some humor, such as a subheading on the huge size of restaurant portions: \\"Nelson, party of four: your muffin is ready.\\"<br />Food Fight is a political manifesto by a crusader who has already been attacked repeatedly by the food industry.

He has had Type 1 diabetes since age 12.  He is now in his late 60's, still works full-time plus, exercises hours every day, and has more energy than most people of any age, with or without diabetes.<br />At age 35, his body was falling apart due to the ravages of blood sugar.  He had signs of kidney disease and eye disease and nerve pain in his legs.<br />Then he discovered how to normalize his blood sugars through the program in this book.  Most of his complications eventually disappeared, and he has had no new complications since.  His theory (shared by most diabetes experts) is that the complications are due to high blood sugars.  But his solution (keeping your blood sugars in the normal range 24 hours a day) is rejected by most doctors, who believe it is too difficult for most people.<br />The three keys to his program are: A very-low carbohydrate diet - This is the most important part and will probably be helpful even without the other parts.  Bernstein prescribes NO sugars, grains, fruits, milk, or starchy vegetables (fast-acting carbs.)  He does recommend relatively small amounts of green vegetables and other slow-acting carbs, because of their vitamins and other nutrients.  This is not an Atkins-style, no-carb diet.<br />Frequent blood sugar monitoring to develop your \\"blood glucose profile.\\" You need to learn exactly how different foods affect your sugars, and how sugars change overnight and with exercise. By checking his blood sugars after each food he ate, Bernstein discovered how carbs raised his blood sugar faster than his injected insulin could catch up. He has you check your blood sugar many times a day.<br />Frequent dosing with fast-acting insulin or (for Type 2s) an insulin-sensitizing pill, to cover your meals, along with a low dose of long-acting insulin to get you through the night and early morning hours. He recommends insulin even for Type 2's who make some of their own, because he believes the injected insulin will take the pressure off the pancreas and allow it to heal.<br />If this sounds like a difficult program, you haven't heard half of it yet.  He also recommends extremely vigorous, anaerobic exercise. He prefers prolonged weight or resistance training to the point of pain, because building muscle mass helps soak up blood sugar and lessens insulin resistance.<br />His program also requires you to counts carbs and proteins and calculate your proper insulin dose before meals. He recommends you have as many as four different kinds of insulin for different occasions.  He wants you to floss after every meal to prevent dental infections.  And there's a lot more.<br />But is it worth it?  In researching my upcoming book, \\"The Politics of Diabetes,\\" I have interviewed four people who read his book.  Two thought it was too hard to try.  One stayed with the program for a while and says it helped, but he has slacked off.  One woman stuck with it and says it saved her life.<br />Diabetes experts I have queried are skeptical of how much the ultra-low-carb diet helps.  They cite conflicting research and the success many patients have even on a balanced diet that includes fair amounts of carbs.<br />There is also no agreement on the need to get blood sugars down to \\"normal\\" (less than 95, say.)  Many docs think getting sugars down to 120 or even 140 will be sufficient to prevent complications in most people.  True, but SOME people will get complications that would not have gotten them if they kept their sugars lower.<br />You have to have some education and a lot of self-confidence to take this on, especially as it may mean educating your doctor as well.  There is a steep learning curve, and this program will probably totally take over your life for the first weeks or even months.  As you get used to it, it becomes less intrusive, but still much more so than the usual programs your doctor may put you on.  It comesdown to how important your health is to you, how much time and money you have to devote to your diabetes care, and especially how much support you have.<br />Bernstein is aware of these difficulties.  He consistently advises lower-cost alternatives to various medications and equipment, which makes him one of the few docs or self-help writers to recognize that money is a problem for many of us.  But the book is a demanding read - densely packed with valuable information on everything from insulin injection and blood glucose checking techniques to the different kinds of oral diabetes medicines, from what to do when you're vomiting (call your doctor immediately!) to pages of low-carb recipes.  The language and style probably work best for people with some college education, although a determined high school graduate could handle it.  It also has a number of inspiring testimonials and a good sense of humor.<br />I think that people who are having trouble managing their diabetes might want to try this program, or at least the low-carb diet part of it.  If you want to do the whole thing, this book by itself won't be enough.  You will need to get the help of a doctor and probably a diabetes educator as well, and having some supportive family wouldn't hurt.<br />If you do try it, I support that decision.  I'd like to hear how you do with it.comes down to how important your health is to you, how much time and money you have to devote to your diabetes care, and especially how much support you have.  <br />Bernstein is aware of these difficulties.

Dr. Polonsky understands that there are &quot;barriers to self-care,&quot; real life problems and situations that get in the way of doing what's best for our bodies.<br />He knows that people make a cost/benefit analysis when it comes to self-care.  If the behavior is too hard or too unpleasant, and the rewards don't seem worth it, we're not going to consistently exercise, check sugars, or eat what we're supposed to.<br />This problem is not just true for people with diabetes.  It applies to anyone with chronic illness, or really, to anybody at all.  I knew about this from living with multiple sclerosis, and I wrote about it in my book.  But I didn't think anybody else had developed these ideas.  I was sure Dr. Polonsky must have some kind of chronic condition himself, because he knows what it's like.  But he doesn't have an illness.  He's just very insightful.<br />I really like the humor in this book.  I know some reviewers accuse him of being &quot;cutesy&quot; or Disneyfying diabetes, but I think being able to laugh at your situation helps, even when it's really painful.  His description of &quot;werewolf eating&quot; and &quot;Diabetes police&quot; are highly evocative -- they get the point across.  I don't think he's talking down to anyone -- he has compassion for people's struggles and wants us to feel better.<br />It's true that Diabetes Burnout does not cite its sources very well and doesn't contain a lot of specific info on diets or other self-care practices.  But that's not its purpose.  He is giving tools for identifying and overcoming our barriers -- social, practical, psychological or economic.  This is important -- some of those barriers may have been with us for decades, and overcoming them can change not just diabetes management, but also entire lives.<br />He also inspires by telling stories of real people he has worked with, who have made great strides in difficult circumstances.  It's entertaining, inspiring and educational (just like my book :-).  What more do you want?<br />David Spero RN, author of The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness (Hunter House 2002) and the upcoming Politics of Diabetes: Social Causes, Costs and Cures of an Epidemic (2005).

But if you're interested in how the food induatry (agriculture, food processing, retail and restaurant) influence and dominate our governments' approach to food, this book is the one for you.<br />Dr. Nestle, a nutrition scientist, has spent years consulting with the USDA and other government agencies dealing with food.  She had a lot to do with creation and publication of the famous \\"food pyramid.\\"<br />In this work, she was subject to relentless lobbying by food companies determined to prevent the government from recommending that people eat less of their products.  They sent whole armies of lobbyists, not just to Washington, but to state governements, universities, and anywhere else they could influence food science.<br />They donate money to universities, fund studies of their own, give gifts to legislators and woo regulators. They frequently get their own corporate representatives appointed to regulatory and administrative positions. As a result, they have watered down or changed any attempt to advise eating less fat, less sugar, or less of anything.<br />I think the great value of this book is revealing how our government works.  This is not just about food.  Every facet of government is subject to corporate influence and domination.  You can really see this in the insurance companies' ability to derail health insurance reform, and the drug companies' blocking drug purchases from foreign countries.<br />Perhaps we can take our government back, step by step.  Food Politics is a good teaching tool for those who want to fight back.<br />David Spero RN...	2004-01-17

Instead, I got a richly entertaining story showing me the people, animals, social forces and cultural movements involved in the fast food industry.  I learned that fast food and industrial agriculture in some ways are not so bad.  In other ways, they are horrifying nightmares that have driven me away from commercially produced meat, hopefully forever.<br />An example of Not So Bad -- I hadn't considered that, for many poor families, eating at McDonald's was the first time they had ever been able to eat out in their entire lives.<br />Example of Unbelievably Awful -- the conditions on factory farms and slaughterhouses, staffed by immigrant workers who are frequently injured, raising animals who rarely get to move, are exceedingly fat and often infected with e coli and other germs. Of course, these farms and processing plants provide food to many markets and restaurants, not just fast food places.<br />Schlosser introduces us to fascinating people, including the founders of McDonald's, the Idaho godfather of French fries, slaughterhouse workers, ranchers, the chemists who create the tastes we eat in all processed foods, and many more.<br />One weakness is that Schlosser doesn't say much about improving the situation for consumers, workers or animals.  He does present some ideas for legislation, but most of the changes that might happen in response to Fast Food Nation are individual food choices.<br />To deal with the health issues (such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity), I believe individuals, families, communities, businesses and governments need to take strong actions. Hopefully, the fast food companies will be part of the solution by selling healthier food (like McDonald's new salads)  and pressuring suppliers to make farms and processing plants more humane and healthful.<br />David Spero RN, author of &quot;The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness,&quot; and the upcoming &quot;The Politics of Diabetes: Social Causes, Costs and Cures of an Epidemic&quot; (out in 2005.)

And if you don't get better, it's because you don't want to, or don't try hard enough.<br /><br />Caroline Myss doesn't just imply that illness is our fault, she wrote this whole book to tell us so.  By downplaying or ignoring the social, economic, genetic, and environmental determinants of health, she turns what should be a hopeful message of empowerment into a club of guilt and blame.<br />Of course, our own behavior and attitudes play a large role in health.  And yes, illness does bring some advantages that some people cling to. But people have good reasons for adopting the behaviors and attitudes they do.  We adopted those behaviors before we knew better, because they seemed necessary at the time.  And we maintain them because our lives are set up to maintain them.<br />Change is hard, especially if you don't believe you can do it, or that your life is not worth the effort.  People need hope, support, and belief in themselves if they are to change.  So when people need to change, to improve their health or their lives, you don't want to start by making them feel bad about themselves.  That's why this book, far from helping people heal, is likely to add another layer of suffering to their lives.<br />My book, The Art of Getting Well, was partly written in response to Why People Don't Heal.  (I have been called &quot;the anti-Caroline Myss.&quot;)  My book explains that illness is not our fault, but it is our responsibility to do the best we can to maximize our health and our lives.<br />It's often the conditions of our lives that make us sick, and many times the key to getting better is  improving our quality of life.  One element in this improvement is learning to value, love and forgive ourselves and our bodies.  Myss takes the opposite approach; she blames.

The healing stories, the practical advice, the positive outlook all resonated with me.  I used some of Dr. Siegel's ideas in my book The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.<br />But I kept encountering people who felt Love, Medicine and Miracles had hurt them or their loved ones who were struggling with cancer.  Dr. Siegel states that &quot;happy people don't get sick,&quot; and makes other statements that imply that illness is mostly our fault.  He has tremendous compassion for the sufferers, but says that they could get better if they got their attitude adjusted.<br />This healing from within may often be possible.  But the physical and emotional conditions of people's lives can make such changes very difficult.  And some diseases are so strong that all the change in the world may help, but will not cure.<br />So I was very careful in writing Art of Getting Well to make clear that health conditions are not our fault.

He believes that nearly ALL back pain and most chronic pain is caused by our mind's using physical pain to distract us from emotional pain that would be even worse.  Usually the emotion is unexpressed anger. He says the mind will actually cut off circulation to muscles or other tissues to create real, physical pain.  He calls this tension myositis or TMS.<br />Usually, the cure involves acknowledging the emotional causes and dealing with them.  He doesn't like to use pain meds of any kind.  Researchers have not found how the brain actually creates the pain Dr. Sarno describes.  Many pain experts and patients do not believe his theories.  But I think he is on to something.<br />In my work as health coach, I use the guided imagery techniques developed by Dr. Martin Rossman and David Bresler.  In guided imagery, people can have imaginary conversations with an image of their pain.  It very often turns out that the pain represents some person or event in the patient's life, usually a person who has done them wrong, for whom they feel a lot of unexpressed anger.<br />I wrote about Sarno's theory and my use of it in my book, The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.

I used her material extensively in writing The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.<br />Most of us don't like to ask for help.  It makes us feel weak, guilty, needy or even &quot;un-American.&quot;  But mutual assistance is the way the world works.  Register gives powerful reasons to ask for and accept help, likely places to find it, and ways of paying people back.  She points out that most people like to help, and that we can help others in our turn.<br />Her book is also very strong on dealing with the medical profession and financial issues, how to keep your illness from impoversihing you.  She continues to thrive with her condition, teaches at a university and has written several more books.  She is an inspiring and practical teacher.	2003-12-23

Think of it as a video game where, instead of sitting safely in your room pushing buttons or pulling on a joystick, you're inside with the monsters, fighting for your life.  The monsters may come from your own mind, but that doesn't make them any less real.  They may attack with guilt, fear and shame, instead of with guns or blades, but they are deadly just the same.<br />I encourage anyone dealing with issues of grief, guilt, or buried pain to read this book.  You may find within it a powerful healing experience.<br />Like a video game, Redemption of the Shattered plays out on different levels.  To survive each level in his grief process, Rob needs to learn new skills, find new help, and discover new strengths.  Each of the 24 levels brings a new treasure, too.  But, like in a video game, successfully completing one level brings Rob face-to-face with old and new demons on the next level.<br />Having to face the same trials over and over, when you think you've beaten them, is one of the few similarities between video games and life.  It would be nice if our inner demons stayed dead, but they usually don't.  They have to be faced, accepted and transformed repeatedly, over time.<br />Redemption shows us how to follow that long, spiraling, often frustrating path.  It is not a self-help book, though, and it is not easy.  It is an adventure through time, space, mind and spirit.  Rob moves from teenage to adulthood and back, and is sometimes in both places at once.  A large number of characters come and go, and the author leaves it to us to understand their significance.<br />The story requires us to remain flexible about time and person, and to a certain extent about grammar.  It's worth the effort, though.  Redemption will challenge you, but will also reward you with scenes of great beauty, a message of profound hope, and a new understanding of grief and what it takes to over come it.	2002-04-15

Her book is packed with information, easy to follow, and explains the issues involved in surgery from the point of view of family, child, doctor and hospital staff.<br />A few of the topics covered: what to take to the hospital, how to familiarize yourself and your child with the different parts of the hospital he or she will encounter, what questions to ask, what to do to protect your child in the hospital, how to take care of yourself during the experience, what help you will need and how to get it.<br />I do not hesitate to recommend this handbook to any family facing a child's surgery.	2002-04-15

Doctors had nothing effective, and still don't. Rossman's book, and the tapes that go with it, got me moving again. It helped me get in touch with inner strength, and find out what I needed to do to recover.<br />I have consulted his book and tapes for nearly ten years, and they have always helped me to reach my maximum state of wellness. I have shared these resources with friends and family, with excellent results in most cases.<br /> Imagery is a way of getting in touch with parts of ourselves that don't talk in words, aspects of ourselves we have ignored,which may be screaming for attention through physical symptoms or painful emotions. Whatever has caused our illness, there are always spiritual and emotional aspects that contribute to our healing or getting worse. Exploring those dimensions of our lives enables us to care for ourselves effectively.<br /> In various imagery exercises, we can \\"listen to our symptoms,\\" \\"explore our resistance\\" (to change) and connect with an \\"inner advisor,\\" a figure of wisdom and kindness who has been with us since we were born. The exercises are always relaxing, frequently informative, and sometimes transformational. They are easy to use and hold up well to repeated use, unlike some visualization scripts which get boring after a few uses.<br /> Dr. Rossman's explanation of what imagery is and how it works is clearer than anything I can provide here. For anyone facing physical or emotional health problems, \\"Guided Imagery\\" is truly a vital resource for self-care and healing.<br />David Spero, RN, Author of The Art of Getting Well: a Five-step Plan for Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness	2000-11-25
