US	52651244	R3G0OBHCMI331X	0743419170	585902307	Secret Ways	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Not her best	I've read just about all of Kat Martin's historical novels and have enjoyed most of them.  This is the exception.  From the start I found the storyline and love story between Vermillion (Lee) and Caleb boring.  Nothing caught my interest and I found myself disliking the characters.  One thing I must say is I get tired of stories where the man thinks the woman is *unpure* and treats her bad as a result.  I want a love story, not a story where the characters beat eachother up verbally.	2003-08-27

Not  only are the two estranged, they are also rivals. Dominic agrees after  Kyle, the heir to the earldom, promises to give him property in return.  Dominic sets out to woo Lady Meriel, the heiress madwoman. <br />After the  murder of her family, Lady Meriel hasn't spoken for years. Her family  naturally assumes she is mad. Living a sheltered life, Lady Meriel spends  her days with animals and time in her beloved garden. When Dominic (posing  as Kyle) comes to her home for an extended visit, she is skeptical.  Eventually Dominic gains Meriel's trust and realizes that she isn't what  she seems. Dominic falls madly in love with Meriel, eventually bringing her  out of her shell. <br />With The Wild Child, Mary Jo Putney has written  another great regency. The only complaint I had (although it didn't take  away from the book one bit) is that once Meriel finally does begin to  speak, it is almost as if she has spoken freely for the past 15 years and  that she has undergone an education, which I don't believe would have been  the case. Other than that, great book!	2000-07-24

The biggest flaw of  all was the &quot;suspense&quot; part of the story. The whole part of  Dexxter and Irene could have been written out and the book would have been  very good. Also, Matt's illness, I thought that it didn't play a big enough  role. It should have been more a part of the story.

Mitch is of all things, a ratcatcher in London. He's  good at his job and down right proud. (as he should be!) One day while  catching a rat a local seamstress puts him in a &quot;compromising  positon&quot; and Mitch is forced to run from her family. He runs into a  local tea shop, where Lady Edwina Bollash is having tea. Almost forced to  go to jail, Edwina saves him by talking to him about his unusual Cornish  speach. Two gentlemen in the shop take notice and they strike up an unusual  proposition: Edwina is to teach Mitch the ratcatcher how to be a gentleman,  speak the Queen's english and be passed off as a viscount. Quite a job  indeed! Edwina and Mitch both agree because they need the money (and Mitch  has a secret yearning to be a gentleman) So the two go off to her home in  Knightsbridge for six weeks of training.<br />At first Mitch is a terrible  student. Refusing to take a bath, wanting his pet ferret to sleep with him,  etc. Eventually Edwina wins out, with a few tricks of her own. <br />As time  goes by the plain spinster Edwina is drawn to the handsome would be  viscount, really a ratcatcher. But he's a ratcatcher! She couldn't fall for  a ratcatcher, could she?<br />Judith Ivory has written a wonderfully written  story that I can guarantee you will savor. My only complaint would be that  the end is too nicely put together, but I will overlook that fact. Mitch  will truly win your hearts and Edwina will make you smile. This is one book  that will stay on your keeper shelf.	2000-01-08

New Year's Babies  is three stories in one book.<br />The Confused Stork by Eugenia Riley  B<br />When Emma wakes up in the hospital after giving birth to her daughter  she is shocked to find that her daughter is missing.  All she remembers is  mayhem in the delivery room and something about a stork...

Almost by  magic, after opening a fortune cookie, Tory and Dillon switch places,  literally.  Tory is now a man but Dillon is a woman who is pregnant!  This  book was so funny that I laughed out loud several times.  (my husband had  to ask what was so funny)  Dillon goes through a baby shower, swollen feet,  a doctor's visit, (complete exam!).  Tory and Dillon find out that the only  way they can find out what they need to do to change back is to reach out  and find out what is really important in their marriage.

Samantha finds that  motherhood isn't too bad, and Jack is pretty great too.  (assuming that  twelve kid thing is re-considered)	1999-12-17

But Lizzie is drawn to Gabriel in ways  she cannot explain, even though she is warned by him to be wary of even  him.<br />Dark magic, druid cults, ghosts, dancing in the moonlight and yet  another of Anne Stuart's famous mysterious men, that is the formula this  novel.  While a nice, fast read, I wouldn't say it's the very best.  I do  recommend it though for Anne Stuart's wonderful storytelling.	1999-12-15

She has spurned every man who has offered for her hand, even after the King has increased her dowry.  <br />When Lady Sophia was twelve years old, she meets  Sir Tobin de Clare and she bets him three kisses.  She loses, but never  pays her bet.  Three years later Lady Sophia and Tobin meet again, this  time Sophia does not realize who he is.  She is immediately drawn to him.   He is the only man that she has ever felt an attraction to.  He reminds her  of the bet and she finally agrees to give him his kisses.  After making  arrangements to meet, he jilts her in the garden, making a laughingstock of  her.    Two more years go by and Lady Sophia still is not wed.  The King of  England has secretly bethrothed her to Sir Tobin and she finds out on her  bethrothal ceremony.  She is very angry, to say the least.  She vows not to  go through with the wedding.  Running away from the castle Sophia cuts her  hair and leaves for London.  Eventually Tobin finds her and Sophia is sent  to live with nuns while Tobin is sent to run errands for King  Edward.<br />Finally one year later Tobin comes back for Sophia and they  marry, although a bad childhood and poor feelings for his father causes  Tobin not to declare his love for Sophia.  <br />I found this book to be  wonderful, quite possibly one of the best medeival romances I have ever  read.  Lady Sophia was wonderful and made me laugh (especially when she was  forced to learn to belch and fart to make people think she was a boy!) and  Tobin made me smile, with his secret love for Sophia.  I highly recommend  this medeival romance, but warn of a late night of reading.	1999-12-11

After a huge fight with him  and his daughter Douglass is left behind with no money or passport. In  grief she goes to the nearby church and cries out that she wishes she had a  knight in shining armor. Low and behold Nicholas Stafford, the earl of  Thornwyck appears out of sixteenth century England. At first Douglass  doesn't believe him that he's from the sixteenth century. She finds his way  of dress strange, his talk ridiculous and the fact that he doesn't know  what a car is or how to use the bathroom is outrageous! Well, eventually  Nicholas wins over Douglass and the two are set to finding out who tried to  set Nicholas up for treason in Elizabethian times. <br />After finding no  answers, Nicholas finally resigns himself that he will stay in the 20th  century and that Douglass is the love of his life. As soon as the two fall  in love, poof! Nicholas is gone back in time. Douglass is at a loss,  especially since history has altered and Nicholas was beheaded for crimes  he did not commit. She is determined to find the answers to clear his name.  But as soon as she finds her answers she is wisked back in time to 1560 and  finds herself at Nicholas's home, before he was an earl and everybody was  happy, although Nicholas does not remember her.<br />Douglass must win over  Nicholas's trust to change history again, knowing that once it is changed  she will be dragged back to the twentieth century.<br />This story was  wonderful! I highly recommend it to anyone, especially time travel lovers.  I loved the way that Nicholas was so excited over little things we all take  forgranted, such as can openers and vacuum machines. I also loved the  interesting information that the readers learns of Elizabethian times. If  you haven't read A Knight in Shining Armor, you must do so now!	1999-11-10

We'd go to the Yakima Valley for  the weekend and all I'd think about was which wineries to tour.  Now the  Yakima Valley is full of wineries, vineyards, hops, apple trees and cherry  trees.

She is a strong woman, bred to be a warrior.  To keep their nations from  war Gyan agrees to become betrothed to Urien map Dumarec, her countries  rival.  Immediately Gyan regrets her decision.  Believing that women are  only to be by their man's side and in their bed, Urien does not impress  well upon Gyan.  Yet she feels she must still go ahead with the union to  keep their countries from war.<br />When Gyan travels to meet Urien she meets  Arthur.  Immediately she is drawn to Arthur and falls in love but she is  promised to Urien, Arthur's rival.  Arthur wants Gyan for himself, but must  first convince Gyan of his intensions.  What follows is an exciting story  of war and betrayal.  <br />Dawnflight is that is unlike any other you've read  about the Arthur legend.  You won't find heavy love scenes in this story.   Gyan is too busy for that nonsense.  What you will find is a wonderful  story full of adventure.  This book cries out for a sequel and I will be  first in line to read it.	1999-10-23

The hero doesn't need to be a millionaire in order to  protect the woman, but I see this over and over again (not only in  Catherine Anderson's books but others).  I forgive writers for this, but we  need stronger heroines.	1999-10-15

To make matters worse, Elsabeth Ker's Scottish clan kidnaps  Alex from his daily bath determined to hold him as hostage.  When they find  that Lord Carey's brother will not pay the ransom they are in a tricky  situation.  An eye for an eye?  As head of the Scottish clan (until she  marries of course) Elsabeth has the power to demand Alex's death, although  she falls in love with the border lord, only to make for a tricky  situation.<br />I found The Abudction to be boring and hard to read.  I didn't  find any chemistry between Alex and Elsabeth.  In other words, if you like  to read a book that will put you to sleep, read this one.  If not, opt for  Patricia Potter's other Scottish novel Starcatcher.	1999-06-18

I've read almost all of Lisa Kleypas's novels, and this one is one of the best.<br />After well-known courtesean Vivian Duvall spreads rumors about Grant Morgan, he vows revenge.  Never  did he realize his chance would come so quickly.  Bow Street Runner Grant  Morgan is called to the docks to see a drowning victim, only to discover  the victim is Vivian Duvall, and she is very much alive.  Upon further  investigation, Grant discovers someone was attempting to murder Vivian,  unsucessfully.  What's Grant to do, but bring her to his own home to  protect her.<br />When Vivian wakes up, she realizes she not only knows her  name, but she also can't believe that she was a prostitute.  Grant uses  this against her and informs her that they had an &quot;arrangement.&quot;   <br />Throughout the next few weeks Grant and Vivian work together to find who  tried to murder her, and they also fall in love along the way.<br />Overall  this was a great book.

Whitney My Love and Something Wonderful were great.  Most of her contemporaries are wonderful too, such as Paradise  and Perfect.  Unfortunetly her last few books haven't been very  good.<br />Seperated at birth from her father and her older sister, Sloan  (where does she get these names??) is asked to Palm Beach to go visit her  multi-million dollar father.  At first she refuses, but after FBI agent  Paul Richardson convinces her, she brings him along to &quot;spy&quot; on  her father.  (Paul believes her father is somehow involved in money  laundering) <br />While at Palm Beach Sloan meets and falls in love with Noah  Maitland, her father's business partner and next door neighbor.  All the  while she's passing herself off as an interior decorator, not the private  detective that she really is.  <br />All in all, this was a pretty good book  but I felt that the characters were not well defined.  For instance, Paris  (another great name there) is angry that Sloan is coming for a visit at  first, but then immediately warms up.  Sloan's father Carter is at first  warm and friendly, but immediately becomes reserved.  The personalities  didn't come across strong throughout the book.  <br />Also, was there  something with Jess and Sara?  Is that another book, or did Ms. McNaught  just want to leave us hanging?  I thought their relationship was much more  interesting than Sloan and Noah's.<br />I am a big fan of Judith McNaught, but  PLEASE go back to your old writing style!	1999-05-05

Normally I read favorite authors, Amazon recommends, friends recommend or I just happen to see it in a bookstore and impulse buy.  This time was  different.  I had a babysitter named Cindy Bonner when I was a child, and  hence the same name, I just felt the urge to read this book.  I absolutly  loved it.<br />This book is set in the years before and after World War I.   Sunny and Gil are first cousins, but although they know it is wrong, they  fall in love anyways.  Guilt keeps them apart for many years and each make  many mistakes along the way.  Sunny gets pregnant and marries a local boy,  whom she later divorces after the death of their daughter.  Gil goes to war  and comes back a changed and wounded man.  Sunny gets pregnant again by her  ex-husband's brother and flees to North Texas, where she marries a much  older man.  Gil marries a local girl (who is also a cousin of Sunny's on  her father's side) and it isn't a very happy marriage.  After several years  Gil and Sunny meet again, realize they are still in love and both leave  their spouses.  In order to stay together they flee to France to live and  finally have some peace.  Unfortunately their happieness ends tragically.   (WARNING, tears likely at the end of novel)<br />This is one of those books  that stays with you long after you read it.  It's definetly a keeper.  In  reading information on other books by Cindy Bonner, I realized this is  actually the 4th in a series that is set in Texas and is about the same  family.  Lily, A Love Story, Looking After Lily and The Passion of Dellie  O'Barr.  I haven't read these books, but they are a must read if they are  as good as Right from Wrong.<br />Right from Wrong reminds me a lot of another  book by another author, These is my Words by Nancy E. Turner.  Set in the  1880's, this is the diary of Sarah Prine.  This book stays with you, the  setting is so vivid and you'll want to read itover and over.

The Fortune Hunter was downright bad, but this one was okay but not great. I've noticed that with  a lot of my favorite authors,their latest books haven't been up to snuff.   Do they get under pressure and not devote enough time to creating their  characters?<br />Alyn Blum-Jones is the only living relation to her aunt  Jacqueline, whom she has never met because her mother was dis-inherited  when she married Alyn's father. Now a year after Alyn's mothers death  Jacqueline wants to meet Alyn. On the eve of her visit to her aunt's  magnificent estate, her aunt is missing, presumed dead.<br />When Alyn arrives  at her aunts' estate she meets Peter Youngblood, a private investigator for  the insurance company who will pay out $20 million if Jacqueline is found  dead. Of course they don't hit it off, the stableman and the butler  (whatever they call him in the book, I can't remeember!) immediately file a  motion to reverse her aunts' will and immediately Alyns' life is in danger.  Of course Peter is the only man to protect her.<br />I felt that Ms. McKinney  could have developed Alyn and Peters' relationship better. One minute they  hate eachother and another minute they love eachother, no in between time  to explore their feelings for eachother.<br />All in all, this is a good,  quick read but wait for the paperback.	1999-04-21

The story centers around  Hanna Trevor, the local mid-wife, her lover Daniel Josselyn and their  daughter, Jennett.  <br />In each book the story becomes more complex and the  characters are more interesting.  The series is about life after the  Revolutionary War and how everything wasn't the picture perfect life  everybody thought it to be.  Greed, debtors prison, taxes, murder, treason,  audultery, rape, prostitution and love are all intertrined in this  incredible story.

Unfotunately he doesn't feel the same way about her.  Jane is  an artist and decides to sculpt a nude statue of Blackburn, with only a  teeny weeny little fig leaf covering him.  Another unfortunate occasion  occours when everybody finds out about the statue and of course a scandal  erupts, for not only did she sculpt Blackburn in the nude, she also  sculpted him with such a small fig leaf.  It doesn't help that later that  week Jane is found at Blackburn's residence unchaperoned AND in a  compromising position.  She is ruined.<br />Eleven Years Later.  Jane comes  back to London as a chaperone to her very, very beautiful neice Adorna.   Blackburn is back in London after serving for England in the Napoleonic  Wars.

So far my favorite by Patricia Gaffney is Sweet Everlasting.   Thief of Hearts was a good story, but not my favorite by Patricia Gaffney.   I did enjoy reading the story, but Anna and John's story was a little slow  and boring at times.  This book took me a long time to read, which isn't  typical. When Anna's husband Nick is murdered on their wedding night, his  twin brother John Brodie steps in to try to find his murderer, and to try  to determine if he is behind a plot to sell ships to the Confederate Army.   Needless to say, Anna and John fall in love, Anna realizes that Nick only  married her for her money, and of course John is accused of murder.

Laura  helps Gabriel realize what his problems are and they eventually fall in  love, although lurking in the background is a killer that keeps entering  Gabriel's dreams. <br />I'm not going to give the ending away, and as to why  Gabriel is having these nightmares.  This book is definetely a must read,  especially for all of the Sharon Sala fans out there.  Ms. Sala has outdone  herself.  This book is just as good, if not better, than Sweet Baby.	1999-03-06

There are more questions, I could go on and on, but I  won't.  I started this book hoping it would be as good as Tempting Fate  (which is a must read, by the way) but was disappointed.

Jack is hand picked by Rosalie's father to become her husband and be his heir.  The only problems are 1) Rosalie does not want to get married, she wants to become a nun, and  2) Rosalie's younger sister Corrine is the most beautiful woman Jack has  ever seen and she's set out to win Jack's heart too.  When Corrine becomes  pregnant by another man, she is determined to win Jack over so she can  convince everybody that Jack is the father of her baby.  Rosalie has her  own secrets, guilt so strong that she feels she must devote her life to the  church.  This is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it.	1998-12-13

I don't read Danielle Steele very often.  A friend of mine loaned me this book and  it wasn't bad.  I did enjoy Sarah's story much more than Charlie's.  I'd  say Sarah's story was a 4 and Charlie's a 2.  I also felt that Ms. Steele  went too in depth into Charlie's life with his ex-wife and their feelings  for eachother and how hurt Charlie was.  Get over it!  She left him for an  OLD man!  If that wasn't in the story, I felt it could have been much  better.	1998-11-24
