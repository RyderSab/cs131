The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life	Books	5	59	65	N	N	Another great simple book with high impact	This book was recommended to me by a new friend Rini from BP, and i love it. I read it just in a two hours flight ( i am not a fast reader!), finishing it right when the plane landed, and i kind of feel very motivated and enpowered!<br /><br />In the simple similar tradition of One Minute Manager, Fish, and other simple to read business book, this one has one great idea about how we should ask questions.<br /><br />In a nutshell:<br />1. Begin with  \\"WHAT\\" or \\"HOW\\", and not \\"Why\\", \\"When, or \\"Who\\".<br />2. Contain an \\"I\\"<br />3. Focus on Action.<br /><br />So, instead of: \\" When are we going to be more competitive?\\", use: \\" What can i do today to be more effective?\\".<br />Or, instead of \\" Who will care as much as I do?\\", use \\"How can I communicate better?\\"<br /><br />QBQ is a simple powerful technique that will improve the way you see life. John Miller has a whole organisation build into training it.<br /><br />Even that the way they write is way different, i would like to compare the idea of QBQ as such similar power with One Minute Manager. It's easy to teach, easy to implement, and have great return if people start using it.<br /><br />So, for 2 hours easy reading that might change your life for the better, you have nothing to lose, get a copy.	2005-08-18

Reading the ones i mark the last time iread it.<br /><br />I love Innumeracy, and I love this one too....<br /><br />This book consists of loosely connected materials that you often see in the newspaper and John take a fresh mathematician look into it, sneering and smiling and teaching us what to watch over next time we read it.<br /><br />The logic will make you smile a lot, and the awakening will make you look at your newspaper with a different point of view, some sort of small revelation.<br /><br />I believe that John Allen Paulo has awaken up the mathematic curiocities in a lot of his readers, including me. He would argue that the percentage is too small to make a dent to this world of innumeracy people, (which is mathematically correct, and he has mathematically proven that into this world).<br /><br />But to those who have been changed, it did matter for their lives. Go get it and have funs reading, if  you found it too daunting, take a rest, and re read the book next week, you will be glad you did.<br /><br />Thank You John.	2005-08-07

Meaningless meaningful search for things that taste like popcorn+coke in the reading paradise of personal enlightment. I finish this book in one weekend. Steven D Levitt from Unversity of Chicago is clearly making an impact in economic with seemingly mundane meaningless everyday life, and turn that into a very entertaining journey.....<br /><br />How to proof that Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers cheat, The Ku Klux Klan and Real Estate Agents, Why drug dealers living with their mom (they don't make enough money!!!), and so on.....<br /><br />I particularly find the phenomena of Crime Decline during the 1990 in USA intriquing and mind bending. I did agree with the conclutions: Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime. Duh! Intriquingly enough, Malcolm Galdwell (who highly recommend this book), in his famous Tipping Point, talk about that same issue of crime decline from the very perspective (broken windows theory) that Levitt disagree in this book! Haha so reminding me of the very concept believed in University of Chicago GSB, that Ideas Compete and People Collaborate !<br /><br />This is avery readable book, even that sometimes it feel a bit too long on the chapter, if only i can ask for more chapters and less lengthy details (which is the exact same feeling i got from reading Tipping Point and Blink).<br /><br />This book will somehow change the ways you see things, and hopefully, you start to ask more questions, the meaningless mundane one that seems like unnecessary, but turn out to become a new found insight unforgetable and change the way you see life.<br /><br />200+ reviews already, this too just a passing of words sent as an appreciation from a place far away ( Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia).	2005-07-16

Most of our reasonnings are correct, but time to time, there will be slip that cause errors in the way we see things. This book try to explain to you the fallibility of human reason in everyday life.<br /><br />Questionable beliefs from ESP to the misperceptions of causal theories etc, we are again put into a very interesting explanations of various common wisdom phenomenons and why they are wrong.<br /><br />Say the belief of: Infertility couples who adopt a child are believe to subsequently more likely to concieve than similar couples who do not. This is not true, and why we got into that?<br /><br />We all try to find meaning in chaos, and vey often the pattern is just a product of our own way that mispercept the random events.....<br /><br />Good read to make us rethink our beliefs and see things in a more open-mind way of life.	2005-07-16

I love Blink and The Tipping Point, but this book probably has much much more materials, arguably more than 5 times of inside that those two best sellers combined.<br /><br />I am very interested in the popular psycology stuffs, and Influence by Cialdini is my fav. So this book in some way give you the same chockful of surprises and new insight that will change the way you think.<br /><br />I came across recomended by a University of Chicago MBA -email friend- who has much similar books favourites and he recomended this highly, and i absolutely agree and i would be glad to recommend this to anyone interested in human behaviour and psychology of bias.<br /><br />MBA students should read this one and surely will enjoy this. I always draw, marks and put notes on my book and i think i end up marking so much of the materials.<br /><br />Section one: Perception, Memory and Context<br /><br />Section two: How Questions affect answers<br /><br />Section three: Model of Decision making<br /><br />Section Four: Heurictis and Biases.<br /><br />Section five: The Social side of judgment and decision making<br /><br />Section six: Common traps.<br /><br />Some will complain that this book derived from a lot of previous psychological research, i agree, so for the psychology veteran out there, this might not the right book for you, but for most of us, this book will enlight, entertain and amuse us all...	2005-07-05

One day when i browse books in Jakarta i bought Messy Thrilling Life by SABRINA. i liked it. So i ordered this one from amazon. And i love this book even much better.(in the same way as SARK; Succulant Wild Women is better than her last one, even that i still like all of her books!!!).<br /><br />Funkier pictures, messy writings, and a lot of enthusiasm, pure emotions written into tiny words of pure =reluctant wisdoms= to share with everyone. a =funky type of SARK=.<br /><br />Lots of painting, hand writings of the 21st century (read: beautifully ugly) canvas, photographs, and emotions.<br /><br />I believe this is an =edge= book, meaning some will love it VERY MUCH, some will think this is just NONSENSE, so... in short this is not for everyone.<br /><br />Sabrina wrote with a good eye and heart, and you can almost feel it.

So, i am biased, and i owned all of TP books, and i visited his website very often.<br /><br />I belive DK and TP is a good combination. This books is so colorful it felt like a traveling guide, but this is a guide for the new Leader in the new millenium...<br /><br />The size is small, in the similar way as of TP \\"Brand You trilogy series\\", but with the color of Re-Imagine. Some materials are from TP older books, and some are new. But all are wonderfully energizing and refreshing.<br /><br />A lot of materials was taken from Re-Imagine, so if you only want to own ONE TP book, get Re-Imagine. ;-)<br /><br />TP is a different type of writer, with followers and critics on both sides. he is not \\"common\\" or \\"neutral\\", he is an extremist, he is a player.<br /><br />To attend his one day public seminar in Singapore you have to pay about 1000 USD per person. So this book (all his books!!! and get Re-Imagine if you have not got one) is a real bargain.<br /><br />If you download his powerpoint files from his website [...] and did not understand some of the slides, you can read it in his books.<br /><br />This is a small books full of RANTS, strong talks, and opinionated LISTs, combine with pictures, colors, and graphics.<br /><br />I enjoyed this chrunchy delicious books very much and read it over the weekend....

SARK is one of the few favourite writers of mine. I think she makes it easy for everyone to feel good and smile.<br /><br />SARK books usually are all hand written and colored, this one is part handwritten and pictured and part typed. It makes the materials more abundance that previous books ( at least 3 times as much ), and still give you a genuine \\"taste of SARK\\".<br /><br />For those who have never read SARK (the CEO, executives, management people, etc), try to dive into a different type of book, go read SARK, it is a different type of \\"self help\\" book (labelling is such a pain, what is self help? aren't all book self help?).<br /><br />The book is about DREAMS, and DREAMS PERSUANCE. as one quote in the book said: \\"HOLD FAST TO DREAMS, FOR IF DREAMS DIE, LIFE IS A BROKEN-WINGED BIRD THAT CAN NOT FLY\\" (Langston Hughes).<br /><br />SARK inspire me to start drawing (what is a 44 years old CEO who have started so many new ventures want to do with Drawing?), her drawing is so simple (the feel is like \\"i can do that!\\") yet so vibrant and inspiring.<br /><br />Caution: Not all part of the book will be in sync with your believe system and your way of seeing life. Then again, what kind of books can make you one hundred percent relevant? If you can take, read, apply some part of the books and see the world in a different light, then it will already be more that enough.<br /><br />What stops you: get the book, find your dreams, and make them real.

This is a very good book on strategy. It shows how hardball players win bigtime all the time. Hardball players push the envelope and make decisive competitive advantage strategy. I think all MBA students of Competitive Strategy should read this one.<br /><br />When Hewlett Packard announced weak results because of price competition in PCs, DELL announced an across-the-board price cut - delivering a swift kick to its rival when it was down. Dell is a hardball player. No other PC maker approach DELL's market share or profitability. Wal-Mart, Toyota, Frito-lay, Cisco are all harball players.<br /><br />There are 5 principles of hardball players: They focus relentlessly on competitive advantage, They strive to convert competitive advantage into decisive advantage, They imploy indirect attack, They exploit their employees' will to win, and They draw a bright line in the cautious zone.<br /><br />6 Hardball startegies layed out clearly with samples clearly defined and described. Unlease massive and overwhelming forces. Exploit Anomalies. Threaten your competitor's profit sanctuaries. Take it and make it your own. Entice your competitor into retreat. and Break Compromise.<br /><br />I particularly love Break Compromise. It is the most powerful source of growth. It is based on innovation and startegic intent.<br /><br />Written by two Boston Consulting Group people should make this book credible.

It is a good book that explain everyday science in a very easy language. I always believe the real test of good teaching is being able to expain complex fenomena in a simple and interesting way.<br /><br />Some materials are a bit too-basic if you already know a lot, so i think this books suits teenager and good for enticing their curiosity to see everyday happenings in a deeper way. To teach kids how to think more and get them interested in life. One good alternative to the world of \\"game boy\\" and all the bell n wistles of computer games ;-) and MTV.	2004-10-10

In short, Henry Mintzberg is critisizing the MBA education, which has a lot of truth inside. I am an entrepreneur strating up several small businesses and have been doing it for 17 years, and recently got my MBA education. This book is interesting and amusing. But here is my 2c: I honestly think MBA teaches a lot of great materials and is very useful in a lot of situation. We learn about the fundamentals of business in general way and not being \\"specialized\\" (that is what Phd for). After learning the basic fundamentals you start to see the business world in a more elevated way, most of my classmates think that they see the whole business with a much fesher perspective. Now, there is also a dangerous side of being an MBA, that we started to think we can solve all problems and get the best solution without deep understanding of the deeper side of the business. And a lot of people becoming more arogant ;-), demanding more salary, etc etc. MBA is also a great place for \\"switching points\\", moving from a specialized area to go to management. Tacit knowledge can not be taught in any type of education without real life experience, but i think MBA is the best next option to groom a \\"general manager\\" type of leader.<br /><br />That said, i still enjoy deeply the book, henry has taught MBA for 15 years, so he know what he talked about. He wrote the great book \\"Rise and fall of Strategic Planning\\". He is always thought provoking and relentless in persuit of what he think is best for management. If you want to get an MBA education, read this book to balance your opinions. If you are an MBA, this one is a good book to reflect the right way you should approach doing business. I like this book very much and recommend anyone connected with MBA (hiring an MBA, wanting to get an MBA, etc) read this book and will immensly benefit from this.	2004-10-01

It is not as easily read as innumeracy, but it is deeper and more insightful.<br />It is written in loose shorter essays focusing on special mathematic things. I love the explanation of &quot;infinity&quot;, &quot;chaos theory&quot;, &quot;pi&quot;, &quot;probability&quot; etc. I think people interested slightly in mathematics will be enchanted and enjoying the book.<br />Some of the essays are only sweet writing words, some contain heavy formula that needs digestions and basic math understanding.<br />There are about 70 short essays in all that can be read independently at leasure. I found out i strted to get dizzy after reading 10 essays in a straight reading.<br />John proved that you can make dry stuff interesting, and if you read some of the materials and use if for conversation, it will makes you look like a whiz with great taste! that is one additional benefit of reading! and you will do it without the usual pain. ;-)	2004-01-25

I have passed that road too, and yeah there are a lot of good books for beginner.<br />Time after time, you will come back to just one deck: Raider White deck, and for me the miniature deck (the size of almost a usual regular bicycle deck). And you will start to forget all the book and time to time come back to the very few books you love. And this one is it. It is a very rich book with deep reading of all the cards. It touch you and teach you deeply and teach you how to grow your own way of reading the pictures of tarot deck.<br />This is not for the ultimate beginners! But invest in this one. After you get &quot;bored&quot; to the beginner books of tarot, you will start to appreciate this book.

I always am interested in How Review works. I think there is some sort of &quot;self selection process choice&quot; in how people review books. I often find the most best sellers books are not very well reviewed.<br />This is a good book, explaining the difference between how men and women see things and how genetically they are different. Allan and Barbara make a good living out of the book, it is traslated to 31 languages and sold for more than 3 million copies.<br />Easy to read, and fun with a lot of witty quotes. Yes, there are several repetitions throughout but any other books always bear repetitions!<br />It reminds me of the what Oscar to films do: Great Review, but not box office, and other Advertising Awards (great ads, no selling), I love 007 series since i was a kid, and i never understand why they never get Oscars. ;-).<br />So, if you want great review books, look for the great review books (you might not like it!), but if you want to enjoy reading insighful difference between men and women, get this book and enjoy it during a nice sunny weekends.	2004-01-25

It is a bit &quot;bitter&quot; for the advertising people (and they will probably hate the book or play some other defences). But i agree that a lot of new advertising is more of an &quot;ART&quot; than a tool for better sales. I love Al Ries thinkering about whatever loses its functions will become an &quot;art&quot; ( think horse, paintings, even architectures etc) and that advertising is in the danger of losing its function (to make better sales) and becoming an &quot;art&quot; instead.<br />A lot of truth and things to think about and to learn from the book, even that it is very &quot;opinionated&quot;.<br />I think this is one of the &quot;have to read&quot; for people in advertising, PR, marketing and even CEO.	2003-12-28

One day of Tom's seminar (frequently held, always full) will cost you 400 USD and he will speak probably only a small portion of what you can learn from this book.<br />The content is very diverse with a lot of materials stuck inside ranging from salesmanship to woman to brand you to design, which you can pick and enjoy from any page with great fun.<br />DK, which is famous with the illustration and graphic heavy books, is a very suitable publisher for Tom's book. So here is a good match and a big resource of business enjoyable book.<br />I am glad that the books get back to the tone of Circle of Innovation and bringing a lot of enthusiatic design and words.<br />I agree that Tom's approach is not very quant like the one we learn from the MBA program (I am in University of Chicago program myself) but we should consider that quantitave and basic analysis is not the only way to approach success and life. Tom comes from Stanford and he has left behind his &quot;numbers&quot; approach and in some way become the guru of the new age.

I agree that the most important thing in business success is the execution of the strategy, and there are a lot (a hell lot of) good strategies get wasted by lousy execution.<br />Execution is important in any type of business, and failing to do so is the responsibility of the leader. Most small business owners know that by heart as they saw the execution right there days in days out, but a lot of big corporation did not, especially those who never really do MBWA.<br />Linking the three processes will be the only way we can execute well. People-strategy-operation surely is the heart of the matter.<br />I like the part of the PEOPLE PROCESS, and i think we often put the wrong emphasis in finding the right people on the right job. We did not put the track of their past EXECUTION into our major consideration.<br />I think this is a good execution-framework book for all leaders and supervisors to learn about execution.<br />I think EXECUTION will be more useful if you also improve you business model innovation, the book &quot;The Ultimate Competitive Advantage&quot; will be best paired to this book.

Hench my thought of the paradox.<br />The writers devide the book into 3 parts: CREATIVITY THINKING, which basically tell you wht creativity is, CLIMATE, which is more like culture with some differences, and ACTION, how individual or corporation can implement the creativity.<br />The authors also describe 7 steps of PURPOSEFUL CREATIVITY, which i found quiet interesting, and formalize creativity into intended innovation.<br />All in all this is a good book which formalize creativity and make it more corporate-like. However i think it will still be a fuzzy thing if you only read this book alone and expect that you can drive your organization to become a creative organisation. This book has a good way of telling you the direction and what it is all about, with a lot of samples (mostly taken from big famous brand name company).<br />I surely hope there are more serious creativity book in the future.....	2003-03-29

It feels some sort of too-narrow and too-thin-spread. You wont get the depth of a biography, not even close, but then you get a lot of great people's short stories of their lives.<br />Most of the current greats are included, each with their short interesting quotes.<br />Overall, this is a greatbook especially for some short battery charging type of reading. One can read a few pages now and then and still enjoying it.	2002-09-30

It is a required reading at University of Chicago Executive MBA program, Competitive Strategy course.<br />The content is quiet condense and within everybody's grasp. There is not much mathematical stuff inside, which is good ;-).<br />It is true that there is much simplification in any game theory, but up to know that is the best possible explaination into the real world, there is no other way to understand the things better. It you are like me, with no prior economic academic background, this book is an eye openner. I enjoy reading it very much. Most of you will.	2002-09-29

It is quiet interesting and engaging to read and good material to accompany the lecture. This textbook also have a lot of good examples.<br />Microeconomics are basic standard material of MBA program, so the materials are pretty much the same as any other Micro textbook. Talking about Supply and Demand, Price elasticity, production, costs, perfectly competitive markets, monopoly, market structure, etc.<br />What i like best is the clear text and explanation that is easy to discern even for me (after 16 years not attending school!), and the very FRESH SAMPLES talking even the most recent happenings in the business world. Yup. THE EXAMPLES are all fresh and interesting.<br />The mathematic is a bit intimidating for people who hate quantitative things.<br />So, if this is not your textbook, this is still worth buying and reading for the explanation and the examples there.	2002-08-04

This is new economy book that should open the mind of people and show the direction of the future.<br />Note that some words are very strong and impolite, but is is damn good and enjoyable. And in europe the two people are very2 famous ala superstars (hmmm, so said my norway friends).<br />The books talked a lot about the FUNKY-ALL-THINGS and give a lot of advices. But the most interesting thing is how they say it, it is definielty different than the normal business book of america, hence the distinction and the unique benefit of it. A lot of the story even are not american, but you have to read it to know how powerful this is.<br />I wrote this on my (at least) 3rd reding of the book on my second book (the first one was borrowed and never returned, so i bought again! from amazon, sent dhl with other books to indonesia). i LOVE this book.	2002-05-07

I love the book and do a review for local magazine in indonesia.<br />I think it is an important book for all high level management teams to think about. It is not that difficult or specific.

The language is engaging and the description is clear. It take a standing on Leadership types and dare to fight the conventional wisdom of leader-vs-manager.<br />This is a book on the thinking about the Leadership type, which describes its stregth, needs and weakeness within corporations.<br />The Artist, Craftmans and Technocrats. Most readers would like to think that he/she is the crossing between Artist n Craftmans and the book do warn us on this. please double check yourself and think again honestly.<br />This is not a very deep book (like Mitszberg: The Rise and Fall of Strategic Thinking), but also not a shallow book (like FISH or W-M-M-CHEESE, ONE MINUTE SERIES), but just right in between. Enjoyable to read.<br />And if not for anything else. the above explanation of the 3 types alone would shred new lights in your view of the leaders. And worth your time invested in reading it. The other important thing to point is that Leadership Type is not teachable or even changeble, so much for the leadership seminars. ( I believe this to some extend, that entrepreneurs are similarly -mostly- BORN and not made!)<br />The book did not give u a HOW TO do something, but let you think about leadership adn how people differ from each others.<br />A mandatory reading for management leader. and Psychology student focusing on management.	2001-06-24

This book has been on my shelves for 2 months before i read it. I know this is an important work, but I initially think it will only be suitable to large corporations.<br />After reading it i realize that this can ultimately be apiled to small/med size companies. Companies with revenue of less than 500K USD/year revenue can reap similar benefit compare to the fortune 500 companies by implementing it.<br />The samples shown in the book make it easier for the reader to copy and adapt for their own organisation. Most samples are derived from the big-companies (typical harvar business book ;-))), but we can adapt it to our (small company) needs.<br />Focus on chapter 3, about STRATEGY MAP. this is most important. And the GENERIC STRATEGY MAP can be appleid to most organisation with minimum of ajustments. COPY and ADAPT. we can not afford to hire the expensive consultants, so we have to be our own consultant. And this book is a good guide.<br />Most small companies do not even have VISION, MISSION etc statements. But the balance scorecard helps us focus on strategy, objectives, measures, target and INITIATIVES that are measurable, in a more descreptive ways. This is in a sense a HOW-TO book about strategy, and about measurements.<br />I've decided to use the sytem for our company sam-design.com which now has 58 people, and sell the intangibles (designs). We won Andersen Consulting (Accenture now) award of ENTERPRISE-50 (awards for most promising small and medium size companies in Indonesia) last November. We think that the strategy describe in the book will boost our company's growth despite the slowdown of the internet.<br />I started to read the book with much skeptism but ended up recommending it to many friends, write a review about it for local magazine and promoting the idea of strategy based on balance scorecard. ( I did read the original balance scorecard book which was published in 96, interested in the idea for a while but did not implement any of it).<br />So for the small companies out there, go and get the book, this is not only for the big-boys....for the small companies out there, go and get the book, this is not only for the big-boys....	2001-03-18

Think how bodyshop can be a household name without any advertising, this is a mixture of business, entrepreneurship, and self determination toward the betterment of the world. a crusade from a lady who genuinely love the -world-, an activist legend of her own.

This book is divided into : Background (understanding the Asia Crisis), Transforming the Nations, and Revitalizing the Companies. A series of -prescriptions- to the crisis for any companies operating in the region.<br />Kotler needs no introduction. Hermawan Kertajaya is the highest paid strategy and marketing speaker in Indonesia, His ability to explain difficult concepts to churn able materials is a gem. He has written many books in Indonesia, and he has a massive -raving fans- ( for i am one).<br />For the companies who has the slightest interest in Asia, this book is not to be missed.<br />I believe CHAPTER 6 (page 163-200), A winning Business Strategy Model, THE SUSTAINABLE MARKETING ENTERPRISE MODEL  is one of the FINEST MODEL for COMPANIES to follow. For anyone interested in MANAGEMENT at all, this is reason enough to read the book.<br />For anybody interested in MARKETING, THE 9 CORE ELEMENTS (p.180 to p.186) alone worth the price of the books, THIS IS A REAL GEM!!! It divide Strategy (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning) to win the Mind Share, and Tactic (Differentiation, Marketing Mix, and Selling) to win Market Share, and VALUE ( Brand, Service and Process) to win Heart Share. This is NOT ONLY for ASIAN COMPANIES, but work universally for any companies. The idea is so simple yet so correct and powerful.<br />If i m forced to make a critic, the book is written a bit too-dry-for-my-taste style, too academic, so to speak, but that does not lessen the value in the slightest.

Books	5	9	20	N	Y	the 3 books to challange your way of thinking!	MY review of  BRAND YOU 50, Professional Service Firm 50 and Projects 50:<br />First of all: This is again a new transition of Toms' work. I miss the pictures as in Circle of Innovation, which makes this somehow  less-crunchy, but unquestionably pure-Tom Peters.<br />The format is new (aka  small size to love n hate!, 3 in a set,etc) using 2 colors (red n black)  and (as always) jam-packed with emotions.<br />The books are typed with  chock-full of MOTIVATED wordsmithing and FULL OF AFFIRMATION !!!!!! mark,  hightly adrenaline-written, and offcourse purely TOM PETERS.<br />Toms  traditional scholastic work of In Search of Exellence has changed into many  phases of writting style (Liberation, the Wow-Seminar, and the TOME -  Circles of Innovation -which is the best ever business-book to me). He is  growing from one good scholar into **Managemet Geek uber-Guru**. More  entrepreneurial than ever, and ALWAYS in the CUTTING EDGE!<br />One at the  SIZE of Tom Peters would definitely have admirers (i m one, so i might be  pretty biased!)  and haters. What we all can not deny is his Clear!  influence in the business world.<br />Materials are put in numbering (50+ of  the most important topics to Tom), often overlapping, tons of very2  personally opinionated shoutings ( i love loud voice! ) , and very often  difficult to digest in one sitting (so reread and reread). It took me 2  weeks to finish the 3 books.<br />These books are ABSOLUTELY worth reading, learning, absorbing and enjoying. Go buy it, at amazon p-l-e-a-s-e!<br />tanadi santoso indonesia	1999-10-10

This book was recommended to me months ago by the director of MM (similar to MBA) Progam of Univ.Surabaya, Mr.Wibisono. I have searched the books, never found it in this area, but could get it easily at AMAZON. This is a good book about putting the direction of a company and how to achieve that. This is particularly useful as of the crisis that happen in these south east Asia region where bankcrupcy will be a norm in these few months (as our currency plummet from 2450 to 6000+ in a few months). We have to rethink the very existence of the company and put a CLEAR VISION and MISSION, and to be able to clearly view our core-competence and the posisitioning of it.
