Yes, it's complete with a red, ribbon bookmark. The layout, cartoon illustrations, and typography are excellent throughout. The book makes a fine coffee-table or office reception area book with bite-size junks of wisdom that we all can use. Click on \\"Search inside this book\\" above to see for yourself.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for those who need a bit more presence, i.e. an ability to sell one's ideas by selling one's self. Although my engineering firm has no salesmen, we do have an abundance of smart but sometime shy and ineffective young engineers who need the interpersonal skills and confident demeanor that the best salespeople display. They each received a copy.<br /><br />I gave a copy to a recent graduate too and to a young man making a career change. They don't teach you these things in college.<br /><br />I need another stack of these since the book makes such a nice gift.	2005-08-22

We just bought five copies of this latest edition.<br /><br />The twenty-one units average sixteen pages each and cover all topics needed to calculate and layout the design of a small commercial building. The book even includes a complete set of ten architectural and electrical drawings, so the reader can see what a completed electrical design looks like when ready for contractor bids. It's all here - from the branch circuits for receptacles, HVAC motors, and lighting through the panelboards, and electrical service.<br /><br />The book has several hundred illustrations, charts, and tables and detailed references to the National Electrical Code.<br /><br />The author is a licensed electrician and teacher. His coauthor is a professional engineer and professor.	2005-08-10

How pleasant is it to be drunk and over-dosed for ten straight days? Well, not very.<br /><br />Upon reading of Hunter Thompson's death, I felt I had to sample his work and bought this and two of his other titles. It is easy and enjoyable reading and artful writing in many ways, well worth reading if you want to see what \\"gonzo\\" journalism is all about. Kind of like looking at some of Picasso's people  - interesting, but you wouldn't want to be one of them.<br /><br />I guess the movie was a bit of a hit, but I have not seen it. If they remake it, I think Howard Dean could play Duke and certainly Jack Nicholson would have to be the attorney.<br /><br />I got the book from one of Amazon's third-party sellers in San Francisco, where I suppose celebrations (as in this book) of the drug culture of the 1960s and 1970s still resonate with many.	2005-03-01

A few important applications such as VisiCalc and Word are also covered. Brief mention is made of hardware trends that created the environment for software engineering.<br /><br />This is a \\"people\\" book. Brief biographical sketches of the key players are followed by a description of the most basic characteristics of each software item and a brief chronology of its emergence into the marketplace.

Although I have programmed off and on for thirty years, I have done little with VBA.<br /><br />One night with this book was all that it took to learn the basics; and I completed the project the following day with only brief use of one other VBA reference book. As noted by another, Wallenbach is the best-known author of books on VBA for Excel and writes with a pleasant style - friendly enough but little of the silliness of some introductory books.<br /><br />The book is written for those with good familiarity with Excel but with little or no prior programming experience. It seems also to be a good quick-start or overview for those with more experience.<br /><br />Code samples are quite short and can be downloaded from the web. There is no CD. You must have Excel 2000 or later. (The book itself was published in 2004. VBA for Excel has changed little since the Excel 2000 version.) You may want Wallenbach's 1018-page \\"Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA\\" or other general reference for heavy-duty VBA work, although of course the on-line Microsoft documentation for VBA is very, very extensive.<br /><br />VBA is of course very similar to its big-brother, the general-purpose language, VB.NET. If you are new to programming and enjoy this book, you can move on to VB.NET easily. Hey, you're not writing macros with VBA, you're programming!!	2004-12-31

As an engineer I guess I admire most those who have made technical contributions; but, with a few exceptions, the most influential and perhaps the most interesting technology leaders are not scientists and engineers. This is abundantly clear in \\"Stealing Time,\\" the not always balanced story of the AOL Time Warner merger and the subsequent problems. The focus is on the personalities and interactions of key players, especially Steve Case, Gerald Levin, Bob Pittman, and Ted Turner.<br />The book reads quickly, like a three-act play. In Act 1, in the midst of the Internet hype, AOL and Time Warner circle about in search of the ultimate merger of old and new media. In Act II the deal is done after long delays for regulatory approval. In Act III as the giant's stock price, revenues, and prospects fall well short of the original projections, all the persons on stage for the January 10, 2000, press conference announcing the deal fall on their swords except for Richard Parsons, now Chairman and CEO.<br />The book introduces each of about ten key players with a brief and interesting biography as they first appear on the stage of this fast-moving drama. I didn't put the book down once I started it. This is a people book, a good read, not a business book, not a technical book.<br />The book, by hinting at corporate deception at AOL and suggesting personal failures of nearly the entire executive team, may be a bit unfair. The merger diverted the attention of the team for more than a year as unexpected, fierce opposition at the FTC (well orchestrated by competitors) delayed closing the deal. The merger was consumated in Janury 2001, two months before technology stocks began their swoon - causing immediate pressure on AOL ad revenues as dotcoms bit the dust.<br />I have followed AOL closely since 1990. For a typical home user the AOL online experience by 1992 was not far from today's Internet online experience (email, chat, shopping, news, entertainment). The technology of course was proprietary and not the http-TCP/IP technology of the Internet. AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy and their founders deserve as much credit as the technology companies for creating the Internet age. This book, an account of a deep-draft AOL going aground, does not diminish my admiration for AOL's important role in the development of our Internet society. A case can be made (but not from this book) that AOL was the most important player in the 1990s in the explosive growth of an online society.<br />The author (and playwright), Alec Klein, is a Washington Post investigative reporter who blew the whistle on AOL revenue accounting shenanigans.

There is hardly a more colorful person in the history of twentieth century media than Ted Turner. He is mad, visionary, obsessed, gutsy, bi-polar, swash-buckling, touching and very likeable. Ted's CCN inspired me to push ahead with my own small technology company.

The subtitle, \\"a romance,\\" is more about Louis' remarkable (half mad) passion for publishing in the digital age than about his courting of the beautiful Jane. Louis' passion for Jane is likely to have been great too since they are still together today living in France with children and $30 million (small change for a position thought to be worth hundreds of millions two years earlier) from the buyout of Wired by current publisher, Conde Nast, in 1998.<br />I have read Wired since its beginning but have tossed my copies. After reading this book I bought a nearly complete set of issues on Ebay for the first seven years (1993-2000), including the premier issue from January 1993, thinking I would enjoy reading some of the early issues again. In any case, they look nice in my library.<br />The author is a Wired editor with first-hand knowledge of all but the earliest of Rossetto's years at Wired.<br /><br />If you are fond of the history of Silicon Valley (as I am), then this is for you. Otherwise there is not much here for the average Joe.	2003-07-30

Teaching is done via many VERY SIMPLE projects, and these cannot be done without Visual Studio. You want to buy the latest version  &quot;Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Visual Basic .NET 2003 (VB .NET) in 24 Hours Complete Starter Kit&quot; which includes a DVD with a trial version of the latest Visual Studio.<br />Projects are all for Windows Forms projects including one session on automating Excel (from a Windows form). Visual Basic.NET's most exciting use for many is for the code behind ASP.NET Web Forms when developing applications with a web browser user interface. The author does mention such use very briefly but offers no examples. There are many fine introductory books at this same beginner level on VB.NET and ASP.NET; so if web applications are where you are headed, this book will not be the best choice.<br />This book might be nice easy step up for someone moving from the Excel macro (VB for Applications, VBA) world into more general applications. If you are a professional but new to VB, the book can be completed in a week end; and you can then pass it on to a kid just getting into programming. As noted by another reader, the description of the language is too brief to give this book value as a reference.<br />Author James Foxall has many books to his credit and writes nicely. For the most part he eschews the silliness of many professionals writing &quot;down&quot; for beginners. There are a surprising number of editing mistakes, but nearly all of the code runs as presented.	2003-07-24

It is not intended for experienced programmers except as a quick overview. Nevertheless, the author introduces object-oriented programming terminology early and uses it consistently in an easy (most of the time), non-threatening way. Non-programmers, who carefully work through each of the excellent examples, without knowing it, will have picked up the basics of object-oriented programming while finding countless ways to automate their day-to-day work.<br />As macro writing becomes more and more like regular programming, learning to use an editor and program development environment becomes more important. Nice use is made here of the VB Editor with emphasis on the Object Browser and the Immediate window - preparing the reader for perhaps moving on to more sophisticated development environments such as Visual Studio, which of course is not covered in this book. (Programming Office applications is included in the latest Visual Studio beta.)<br />It is a joy to find a book that teaches macros with VBA in a way that permits easily moving on to more general software development with VB. The early Office macro languages were well removed from \\"real\\" programming; but VBA has changed that. OK, so perhaps it is softball and not baseball. This is a great book to give to an administrative Microsoft Office workaholic who is restless for more knowledge and might just become a self-taught developer.<br />This book has a 2001 copyright; but as I write in July 2003 I still cannot find a better first book for VBA with Excel for non-programmers.<br />On July 24, 2003, I want to add that there are two speed bumps in the book where the content is decidedly more difficult than the balance of the book. The first, midway through the book, is a chapter on manipulating Pivot Tables; and the second is an overly-fancy final chapter with lots of Pivot Table and graphics content. Both of these chapters are useful; but the level of difficulty seems two steps up from the other chapters. Perhaps these two chapters prompted some of the negative comments by others. You can safely skip these two (of twelve) chapters if you wish.eful; but the level of difficulty seems two steps up from the other chapters.

The book is not an in-depth guide to using Visual Studio and barely touches on extending and customizing Visual Studio. A better title would have been \\"A Developer's Accelerated Introduction To .NET.\\" It assumes the reader is a working developer, new to .NET, and moves at a brisk pace. Only one of twelve chapters focuses on the Visual Studio tools although Visual Studio is used throughout to design, code, compile, run, and trouble-shoot examples for nearly every topic. After brief disappointment (I wanted a Visual Studio handbook), I read the book cover to cover and learned something in each chapter after more than two years of heavy reading and significant development effort with .NET. If I taught a course on .NET, this would be my text!<br />Most of the .NET landscape is explored in the 369 pages - including: Visual Studio, the .NET framework and CLR, VB.NET, Windows forms, web forms, web services, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, XML, and COM interoperability. But C# and C++ are given almost no space.<br />Design and code samples are numerous and are no longer than needed to demonstrate the essential concepts. You will want to be sitting at your computer with a full deck of .NET available - Visual Studio, IIS, and SQL Server. The code can be downloaded.<br /><br />This is probably an ideal book for someone crossing over from the Java world or moving on from older Micsrosoft technologies. If you are quite expert in other OOP technologies but new to .NET, two days with this book will get you started on your first .NET project or prepare you for a .NET job interview.<br /><br />This is the author's first book; he is an experienced system architect working in .NET and COM. The publisher, No Starch Press, is small and new but headed by one of the Apress (serious books for serious people) founders.

I expected this book to follow the customary Teach Yourself format, which includes lots of hands-on exercises. But this book is for reading, not for sitting at your computer and doing some TCP/IP utilities. I realized that Casad was truly an expert (12 books on networking) and that I had a very nice, accurate, 414-page overview of TCP/IP (broadly defined): network access layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, and applications layer (HTTP, HTML, SMTP, SNMP).<br />So the book served me well. I have a very broad technology background including system administation and software development and have set up Windows 2000 networks from scratch including Active Directory and DNS. Now, if I need a quick refresher, I have a good reference that explains the TCP/IP basics. The book will stay on my shelf for a long time.<br />This is one of three or four books that nearly all system administrators and developers working with TCP/IP platforms should read. Very experienced architects and developers will not find this too easy. For network professionals of course this is only a primer.	2002-11-22

Working on an ambitious .NET project and with little previous experience with SQL Server, I wanted to get comfortable with the physical implementation of relational data bases while I was still doing the logical data base design using Embarcadero. This book met all my needs and was enjoyable to read.<br />The book has 850 pages and has a CD with a 120-day evaluation copy of SQL Server 2000. The code for the exercises is available for downloading from the SAMS site. The organization is chronological, with steps ordered pretty much as you would do them if you were installing, setting up and administering a new SQL Server installation. You should be comfortable in a Windows 2000 or NT environment and have done some prior work with a database before attempting this book which is written for computer professionals.<br />The book did not seem like a typical SAMS Teach Yourself book, which are very useful as tutorials but often poorly arranged and indexed as references. This book together with the exhaustive and detailed SQL Server Books Online (the Microsoft SQL Server manual on the CD) will be all of the references you will need for physical data base design and administration. You will need other references for logical design of a relational data base and for the other platform technologies such as ASP.NET and VB.NET that you may use to do a full application.<br />I was pleased with the exercises. Each stood alone for the most part, allowing me to jump around a bit and still do those exercises that were useful to me. I was also pleased with the section on security. Security is a subject that I usually dread, but here it was covered in some detail but very clearly.<br />The author is a senior Microsoft SQL Server team member.	2002-07-23

You should be at least a mid-level developer/programmer with good familiarity with at least one OO language since the author assumes you have no need to be briefed on the Windows OS, HTML, the basics of LANS and the Web, and programming language features common to C++, C#, VB.NET, and Java. While there are numerous code fragments in C#, VB.NET, or C++, the book speaks to broad architectural issues, and Java programmers also will have no problem following the text.<br />The book permits one to kick the tires and explore the boundaries of the .NET platform. After one full day of reading answer questions such as: What are the features of .NET and how are they tied together? Where does .NET advance the state of the art? What are the limitations of .NET? How do I bring older technologies, like COM, into .NET?  When items are addressed in some detail, they are advanced topics such as the use of delegates and events in C# and VB.NET.<br />While most useful for developers needing their first intelligent look at .NET, the book would be good preparation for a designers and architects wanting to be sure that .NET can be used for implementation of the design and for Java programmers who want to see if Bill's new dog has fleas. Since it's a brief high-level tour of capabilities, the book is not intended as a programming reference and does not cover the low level things that we understand but sometimes forget.	2002-04-20

It's richly illustrated on every page in color and printed on heavy, semi-gloss paper. The 192 pages cover the period 1750 - 1993 but are limited to European and American design. The book was originally published in Germany, and German designers have coverage that is perhaps disproportionate.<br />The appendices include a useful chronology, an ample bibliography, an index by subject, and an index of the more than 400 names whose work is mentioned in the body of the book. The glossary unfortunately is far too brief.<br />I have a very large library and prize books like this which can be repeatedly browsed with enjoyment or quickly used for reference. It would also make a nice gift for a young person with an interest in art who does not yet realize that art is all around us in things we use each day.	2002-04-12

OO came first and then came UML to model it! This book is all about the principles of object-oriented requirements, analysis, and design first and secondly about the UML tools for modeling these steps in project development. That's as it should be since OO is the thing most to be admired, and UML is (just) a popular and very useful language for modeling OO development. Too many UML books are so intent on UML that the fundamentals of OO are ignored. The first edition of this book was published in 1995 just before UML was born. Its author, Scott Ambler, is a prolific and renowned writer and developer.<br />The book has many detailed UML diagrams and is clearly written in a pleasant, professional style. The book is not about implementation. Look elsewhere for sample code, including some of Ambler's fine other publications.<br />Don't be lislead by the word &quot;Primer&quot; in the title. It's for the serious reader and would make a good text, but for a junior or senior level CS course. If you are a professional and could have just two references in your library for your first OO project, this 523-page book together with a good programming reference (Java, C++, C#, or VB.NET) would be a good choice.	2002-04-12

This is  ICONIX, a compact method borrowing UML	This is the eighth software engineering title that uses the UML (Unified Modeling Language) that I have read in the last five months as I work to establish a software engineering guide and reference framework for a small team at my technology company. This book really sets forth the ICONIX methodology, the author's streamlined approach to modeling using mostly, but not only, UML.<br />Because of the author's quarrelsome nature and unusual departures from common progressions in the model views, I found this book less useful than the others. The author repeatedly explains (with a careful record of the dates) how much of his integration of the competing OO modeling methods preceded the work of the UML founders (Booch, Jacobson, and Rumbaugh) and frequently raises the small quarrels in the UML world for no purpose except to give a quick and unsupported opinion. Not surprisingly, ten of the twenty-five citations in the bibliography are the author's prior papers.<br />Although the title claims the method is &quot;use case driven,&quot; techniques and guidelines for use cases are poorly done; and the author suggests that the requirements stage should begin with domain modeling and &quot;robustness diagrams&quot; before text for use cases is written. The author also places heavy emphasis on screen mockups during the requirements stage.<br />The contents would make a good lecture or two; but it is an annoying departure from the efforts of many to extend and enrich UML. Since the book is only 165 pages, it won't hurt for long, and there are thoughts here and there worth reading. Perhaps it's tongue-in-cheek, a test to see if we can spot obvious logical problems with the method.	2002-03-31

In part II the author proceeds step by step through the typical software engineering phases beginning with requirements definition, illustrating the use of UML tools for the general case of a project where the user interface will be a browser (thick or thin, your choice). Requirements and analysis steps are not particularly heavy with new material; but in the design phase the author nicely extends UML with notations for server pages (ASP, JSP, or other), client pages (HTML, DHTML), forms, framesets, client script objects, etc. There are lots of code shells for the server and the client. The author is clearly a programmer as well as an architect and modeler.<br />Two of the four appendices are very useful. One summarizes the extensions. Another provides all of the UML diagrams and even code outlines for a small sample project.<br />The book is heavier on the Microsoft technologies than Java, and it's too bad that the book predates .NET. The concepts are still useful and with some thought can be extended to the richer environment presented by .NET.<br />Since many projects start with an inflexible constraint that says the user interface will be a browser connecting to an Internet server, someone working on such a project might as well was have his UML reference in a Web flavor. I am aware of only one other book with this specific purpose, and it is for Java and out of date.<br />Some new concepts, good writing, lots of UML diagrams, and lots of code shells give it four stars.	2002-03-30

Part II and 110 pages provide a case study in chronological sequence with the UIML diagrams shown for each step. The case study ends with a brief intro to design patterns, a hot interview topic for developers. Part III and 68 pages provide an interesting chapter on UML in embedded systems and a look at where the UML is heading as far as the GUI and expert systems.<br />The book is clearly written by a PhD who is a former PC technical journal editor. The writer is now an analyst and UML practitioner, and his working experience in the field makes the book a very practical guide. The UML diagrams are clear and simple.<br />UML is pretty much for computer professionals, so this book is most useful for professionals who need to quickly get up to date with the UML, the worldwide language for modeling software systems. For those planning to use UML on a project for the first time, the book's organization makes it a useful reference for the vocabulary and notation of the UML.<br />Since the UML is not yet a language that can be used to generate code with commonly available tools, the book has plenty of diagrams and Q&amp;A at the end of each chapter but not the sample code that many Teach Yourself readers are accustomed to finding. So this one can be read in a comfortable chair with your computer turned off.<br />Read this first and then if necessary dig into the more technical Addison Wesley Object Technology Series where each title is blessed by the three creators of the UML - Booch, Jacobson, and Rumbaugh.<br />Any fear about this still new thing will be gone. You will be able to use the UML when you complete this book!	2002-03-11

This book is for analysts; the discussion is about the nature of business processes that have workflow as a key characteristic. It is not about the architecture of computer solutions for such processes. If you follow the methodology in this book and flesh out the diagrams with use cases (just briefly touched on here), you will have captured most of the requirements for a business workflow process.<br />The book is nicely bound and well written. The authors have been around a while and the vocabulary and approach fit nicely with older concepts like business process reengineering. The authors are not unaware of the latest developments and &quot;UML&quot; crops up  here and there but not in the index. The diagramming is very simple compared to UML activity diagrams.<br />This is good reading for the domain experts on a team working on the requirements document and a nice primer for geeks who are forced for the first time to talk to the business side of an enterprise.	2002-03-10

(I have corresponded with the author and he is perfectly fluent in English.)<br />A crisp theoretical introduction to object-oriented methods is followed by a brief but clear explanation of the UML notation for all of the diagram types.  A third section then addresses implementing UML from a software engineering standpoint. The UML approach is discussed as it relates to the classic waterfall lifecycle as well as newer iterative lifecycle.<br />A 48-page case study complete with UML diagrams completes the body of the book. A lengthy appendix provides a reference section for UML basics.<br />This is a great introduction for analysts, software engineers, and developers who are experienced in older analysis and modeling languages since the historical context is nicely described.<br />I have a large library on software engineering. This book is one of my favorites, and I took the time to locate the author and thank him for the book	2002-03-10

You need something to formalize the process. Somewhat bewildered by all of the UML and other modeling methods that are available, you decide that use cases are easy to understand, the methodology quite easily learned and particularly applicable to the workflow application that you have to design. You've got the Jacobson early books but need something that you can hand out and say, &quot;This is our standard for use cases. We start next week on getting our software requirements done formally.&quot;<br />That's what I did. Bought one copy for myself. Got through the 270 well-written pages quickly and quickly ordered a copy for the other three members of the team.<br />The use-case methodology outlined is text-based with only the simplest graphics. If you like the more graphical methodology for use cases found in UML standard, you won't adopt this book as your company standard but will still gain valuable insight in use case analysis. At least pass it on to the business guys on the team so they have some clue on how to think about requirements.	2002-02-08

Well, it's the right book but the wrong cover. This printing has a cover shot of the actor who portrays Nash in the current hit movie. If you are a science and technology buff, you want the earlier printing of the paperback with the photo of the real Nash on the cover. (I have the wrong book and just ordered the right book from Amazon as well.)<br />If your academic life included time as a graduate student in math or the physical sciences, you will want this book. Sylvia Nasar, a journalism professor at Columbia, writes a sensitive chronology that lets this intriguing story of a Nobel-winning mathematician, whose genius wrestled with schizophrenia, come alive without the need for a motion picture. I guess I will do the movie too, but it could not possibly be better than the book.<br />A caution though. While there is no more mathematical jargon than absolutely necessary, this book is perhaps best for those whose academic backgrounds included at least a brief period in a graduate program for math or the physical sciences. The prides, ambitions, fears, and relationships in the world of Princeton, RAND, and MIT PhDs may be too unfamiliar or even boring to others. I guess, too, that the book is a fine study of the world of life on the edge of sanity; and those, unlike me, who are experienced in the fields of psychology may also find interesting content from their view.	2002-02-02

Having worked through the Deitels' C++ book two years back, I was delighted to find their VB.NET book. Training programmers is the business of the Deitel family. This book, like the others, is finely detailed. The book uses color to enhance the text and full-color on every screen shot. It's up-to-date with Beta 2 of VB.NET and the .NET IDE.<br />The 1517 pages cover each topic from the ground up, but it is so well written (and beautifully printed) that it makes a great text for learning VB.NET even for programmers who are already expert in another language. Remember it's for learning, not for reference, and for those learning VB.NET from the ground up. Those with a good foundation in VB6 will want to look elsewhere unless they have the patience and desire to review fundamentals.<br />The book is loaded with code samples, which are on an enclosed CD, and chapters are followed with long problem sets. Solutions to some of the problems can be found on the web site. ASP.NET, SQL Server, ADO.NET, and Web Services - the other fundamental technologies in the huge Microsoft .NET initiative - are all covered in enough detail to permit completing simple real business applications.<br /><br />Spend the extra $30 if you are serious about programming. The Deitel books are used on many college campuses for programming courses. If you are moving into programming from another technical area, you will be well grounded and ready to apply for entry-level jobs in the exciting world of .NET after you complete this book.	2002-01-18

Part II has one brief chapter on the seven key MS server products that provide the horsepower behind the applications developed for .NET. An appendix covers the basic of Windows 2000 Server and Active Directory.<br />The book is meant as an overview for IS managers and software architects. Developers may want to read another book for their first look; C# is not even mentioned. The book is a bit uneven with unexpected bursts of detail on, for example, XML code and later on SQL Server.<br />I found the book useful, after several months working on a .NET project, as a quick check on whether our contemplated architecture was taking advantage of all of the Microsoft technologies. I am not sure that I would have enjoyed the book if I had not been already fairly well read on .NET; but none of the other overviews that I have read covered all of the MS technology bases. Architecture mistakes are costly, so the $...  is well spent.<br />Curt Simmons writes nicely so the book is a quick read.	2002-01-13

That's HailStorm.<br />An alpha release called HailStorm in a Box, or HSiaB, is available now for developers wanting a head start. HSiaB runs only on your LAN with your HS server doing the work of the future Microsoft server. It's free on the Microsoft web site. HS is all implemented in SOAP and XML of course. HSiaB requires Windows 2000 and SQL 2000 and each of these is free in a trial version from Microsoft as well.<br />This is bleeding edge stuff and the name &quot;in a Box&quot; is reminiscent of the early (1994) exciting days of browsers when many of us got &quot;Internet in a Box&quot; from Spyglass, the holder of the first Mosaic commercial license. HSiaB is not a revolutionary event like Mosaic, but it is very significant.<br />The book is a quick 203-page guide to HSiaB with plenty of coded examples. This is great fun for the serious geek even if you hate the name Microsoft. You can pick it up and finish it in one sitting since the code can be comprehended without actually running it. Installing HSiaB (fully explained in the book) and running the code will give hours more of fun. Think of something so new that you actually do some setups from a command line. Bill must have hacked this together himself. Way to go, Bill!<br />Imagine getting excited about something like this during the holidays. I must be sick.

I am using Embarcadero ERStudio for database modeling. I have a great library (more than 20 titles) on relational database modeling and design; but this is the one that I keep on my desk. I am pretty much following this book step by step on my current project. The author uses the IDEF1X diagramming notation for logical design, which, quite conveniently, is what I use in ERStudio.<br />This is a great guide for the experienced professional developer who may do database design only occasionally. Examples are all from the business world. The book is filled with code, which can be downloaded.<br />The 606-page book has two sections: (1) logical design and (2) physical design and implementation. So far I have only completed the first section, but looking ahead it seems that this book will carry me all the way through actual testing of my finished application.<br />The name suggests, perhaps improperly, a particular connection to Microsoft's SQL Server. The book addresses design and implementation issues on a general relational/SQL level; and the specific setups and interfaces (the MMC for example) of Microsoft's latest relational database, SQL Server 2000, are absent. I do not see a single SQL Server screen shot among the hundreds of illustrations.  Specifics of setting up SQL Server are available in dozens of other books. This is a software engineering book, not a system administration book. Those making their first attempt at relational design will find the book a bit too challenging unless they are serious professionals.	2001-11-25

C# is the professionals' preferred development language for the .NET platform. There have been many changes in the .NET platform (although fewer in the specifications for C#) since the book was first published in July 2000. For example NGWS, next generation windows services, VOS, virtual operating system, and VES, virtual execution system, are used throughout to refer to essential portions of the .NET environment; but these generic terms have been replaced in the latest (beta 2) Microsoft release of .NET and C#. Having read two other .NET books prior to this, I was initially confused by the vocabulary of this book - until I looked at the copyright date.<br />Nevertheless, this small (9&quot; x 6&quot;) book written by a seasoned professional can be usefully and easily stuffed into the briefcase of the experienced programmer.<br />The publisher should do a second addition.

C# is the chicken in this trendy summer salad and makes exploration of all of the many green things more filling and more fun. There are 970 pages from a very experienced Windows developer with a clear and pleasant style. The index is ample. More than 60% of the pages include some code, and the code can be downloaded from the web. You need to have Beta 2 of Microsoft's Visual Studio if you intend to work the examples. This latest Visual Studio is the single IDE needed under .NET for VB, C#, C++, ASP, HTML, etc. All language tools have been modified for .NET, and Visual Interdev functions are now integrated with Visual Studio. Beta 2 is not included but can be obtained for $12.95 (free except S&amp;H) from Microsoft.<br />Before starting a new project, I wanted to know what the possibilities were with .NET technology. Installation of Visual Studio .NET Beta 2 (about one gig) on Windows 2000 Server (Professional will do) was absolutely painless, and this book guided my exploration of all of the .NET basics. If you seek to buy a complete C# programming reference, then you will want to look elsewhere, since much of this volume goes beyond C# into a technical survey of .NET.<br />The style is that of a tutorial (but not the For Dummies or Sams style). You will get the maximum benefit if you fire up the IDE and type or paste in the code in the examples; but, if you need a quick overview, just read the book because there are plenty of screen shots. The publisher, Apress, is increasingly known for technical treatments aimed at professionals. I often look to Wrox for books like this but sometimes find too much haste and too little quality between their beautiful red covers. Apress would be in place in a university classroom, Wrox (abundant and very useful) seems more for the community college.<br />My only complaint - use a higher quality paper for the cover because I value my books and like them to look good on the shelf.<br />One last thing - .NET is lots of fun.

I preferred this book to the Simmons MCSE book because it is was more readsble. (Simmons has a second ISA book that has received great Amazon reviews, and I am a big fan of many of his books.)<br />The book is printed on better than average paper, and 909 pages result in a volume that is thinner than the 655 pages in the Simmons MCSE book. The installable CD has the full text in several different formats including a fully searchable HTML format. The CD also includes a nice set of audio tutorials and access to a web site for further assistance.<br />I was forced to fall back on my Microsoft IP networking library to review of some basic IP networking concepts. One certainly wants to frequently use the [router print] command from the command prompt to check routing tables on any host or serer when trouble shooting the installation, and neither the Simmons of Shinder books covered basic IP routing in any detail. The Shinder book said right out that a companion IP networking book would be useful<br />A big hint. After you install ISA perfectly including the trivial setup of clients as SecureNAT clients (more complex client types readily available), you can't initially get anything through ISA, not even a simple web browser request to the Internet. Go to Chapter 8 and set up rules to allow Internet access. (Simmons covers this more concisely and perhaps better on page 127.)<br />This book is actually by two Shinders, Dr. Thomas Shinder and Debra Littlejohn Shinder, Toms' wife. When a real MD turns to software consulting as his full-time career you can be sure he really loves the stuff. The style of the book shows this. It is nicely written. The Shinders are authors of several other Windows 2000 books.	2001-08-04
US	52917941	RU1KCE5VBTPNN	354076092X	91885377	Inside Relational Databases: with examples in Access	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	I bought 3 copies of this grammar of the relational model.	This very readable book is meant as a companion to Access but is useful as a reference when working with any relational database. It provides a brief 252-page statement of the principles of Codd's relational model, including normalization, keys, relationships, referential integrity, and SQL. It has many fine examples, which are also included on a CD.<br />Without close attention to relational rules, most new database architects will find implementation and maintenance problems down the road, since Access itself can be used to easily create tables that do not follow the relational model. The common Access how-to books often only briefly discuss the grammar of the relational model.<br />One author teaches relational theory; the other is a former Microsoft top gun for the development of Access.<br />This book is indispensable for the new database architect and a useful quick review for the more experienced. I handed out two copies to staff programmers and kept one for my own desk.	2001-01-17

The title conveys well the usefulness of this book.<br />After wading through a dozen books on the theoretical aspects of relational database design, I was looking for a good introductory text on the actual practice of building tables. I found this book an excellent primer.<br />I have made this book required reading at our company for novice database developers. It's a quick read and removes the fear of atttempting database development. It's an a - z approach, so coupled with one of the common ACCESS references, the book provides all that is needed for single-handed developement of a simple relational database project.	2000-10-29

This book is a nicely written chronicle of Seymour Cray and his supercomputing associates. The book covers Cray's entire professional career - from Cray's early days with pioneering Engineering Research Associates until his death (from injuries in an auto accident) in 1996 as he struggled to reinvent the glory days of super-computing with a new company, SRC (Seymour Roger Cray) Computers.<br />By the way, as a native of Minnesota and Wisconsin, it was pleasant to recall that Control Data and Cray Computing made the area around St. Paul (Wisconsin is just across the river) one of the hottest technology areas for two decades.<br />Cray was totally absorbed in computing. If you share some of his passion, you will love this. Non-tech types will not enjoy it and will wonder why he did not &quot;get a life.&quot;	2000-10-28

Each subject receives ten to twelve well-written pages by prolific journalist Robert Slater - Von Neumann and Shannon, Mauchly and Aiken, Shockley and Cray, Gates and Jobs, Backus and Knuth, and many others.<br />This book is for the serious reader, interested in the history of science and technology.<br />The book is part of my 900-volume library on science and technology, and I strongly recommend it. With the short chapters on each subject, the book would make a good gift - something to be carried in a brief case on long trips.	2000-10-28

The book met our needs extremely well.<br />This book is intended for senior programmers and systems architects. It requires significant prior programming experience and a willingness to deal with a high levels of abstraction. (You will sometime think that you are reading a college textbook.) The book uses a real-life development project as a theme and always returns to more practical matters after explaining the theoretical underpinnings.<br />This is not a tutorial for installing Microsoft tools. There are lots of Sequence Diagrams and other architectural diagrams but few screen shots.  If you study this book and understand it well, you are the type, like the author, who is invited to speak at seminars. I have not yet achieved that level of understanding, but the light already has gone on for me in several key areas.	2000-10-05

This book was outstanding as well. The Series has three choices  for learning Access: one titled &quot;Brief,&quot; a second titled  &quot;Introductory&quot; and this most complete volume titled  &quot;Comprehensive.&quot;<br />Most will do just the ten Access tutorials,  skipping two introductory Windows 98 tutorials. Each tutorial has two to  four one-hour sessions. More than one hundreds pages of quizzes, case  studies, and labs supplement the tutorials and make the book an excellent  text for junior college or commercial courses.<br />You need a working copy of  Access 2000. For each tutorial, the student designs tables, queries, forms,  and other elements step by step at his computer. This book is very detailed  and very clear. Almost every keystroke is described, and every important  input and output is captured with screen shots.<br />Base files and data for  the tutorials and problem sets first have to be downloaded first from the  Internet. No table data entry is required except where required for  learning.<br />The book is beautifully printed and illustrated, almost  totally free of typos, and lays flat for ease of use.<br />Don't turn your  nose up when the first two Windows tutorials describe how to use a mouse.  It gets really good quickly and ends with macro and Visual Basic For  Applications in tutorials 9 and 10.	2000-08-29

The content of this book  will serve as a complete reference (and as a tutorial) for the ambitious  beginner who is not content with a FrontPage level capability to produce  web pages but wants to know the innards of HTML. Other reviewers have  commented extensively on the content; I want to call attention to the great  design.<br />I find myself picking this book up just to study the typography  and graphic design. The publisher, Peachpit Press, uses a colorful, boldly  patterned, branded, cover design on the Visual Quickstart series to draw  one's attention. Inside each page is laid out in two columns on  high-quality bright white paper. The inside columns on the facing pages are  used for illustrations, primarily screen shots, which although small are  clearly printed. Bold text and judicious use of red as an accent color  quickly guide the eye to headings and features.<br />The book is very  carefully produced and could serve as a style guide for in-house  publications.	2000-08-20

This book is one of three favorites.<br />Lori Sanders writes with a very pleasant style. I was  surprised to find that this grandmother and seventeen-year veteran of IS  management had no prior published works.<br />The first section (96 of 239  pages) gives a nice overview of resource organization under Windows 2000,  especially Active Directory (the database for all user and resource  objects), the common domain models, security, and organizational units  (OUs, the smallest containers within a domain).<br />The second section of 43  pages clearly explains the basics of planning user and group accounts that  are used to authenticate users and then to authorize access to all network  resources.<br />The third and final section on environment management covers  user profiles and group policies that permit the desktop, network setting,  and applications to be separately tailored and centrally administered for  each of the organizational units in the Active Directory. Finally, the book  covers the new IntelliMirror feature that, together with other features,  permits an administrator to maintain a clone of each machines environment  and to install and restore completely from a central point.<br />Throughout  the book you will find only a handful of screen shots, for this is a book  to help you understand the logic and possibilities behind the features  (especially the new ones) of W2K. You sit in a comfortable chair as you  read this - TV on, computer off, dog at your feet.<br />The book assumes only  a brief familiarity with NT and knowledge of computer networks in general.  Few will be intimidated by the book, but even the most experienced NT  administrators will find valuable insights.<br />I want to write like Lori if  I get the chance.	2000-06-14

In May 2000 as I installed Exchange 2000 I needed to trouble-shoot SMTP at a low level. Chapter 2 with its instructions on how to roll your own SMTP session using nothing but  telnet helped me find an access problem that had eluded me for  days.<br />Understanding DNS was also a snap with this book. Banging around  with ping still is an essential check on installation integrity when  setting up servers and workstations. The common, low-level utilities,  including system sniffers and logs, are nicely explained throughout the  book.<br />The book is only 234 pages and many of the details on Exchange  4.0/5.0 will not be of interest for much longer. However, the essentials of  Internet SMTP mail are covered so clearly that this book is one that I will  retain in my library for a long time.<br />The book is lots of fun for those  who like to hack away from  the DOS prompt (and a bit beyond). However, if  you think &quot;ping&quot; is something that goes with &quot;pong,&quot;  you can skip this one.	2000-05-21

This Dummies book I took home and planned to skim through it  first, thinking it would be a nice quick introduction.<br />The book got  mislaid, and I did not pick it up again until I was nicely up to speed with  Active Directory and had done several installations. I read it anyway on a  Saturday night as a quick review and was surprised at the clear style, nice  organization, and adequacy of its coverage of the subject matter.<br />If you  have just a day or two to get up to speed with this important new Microsoft  technology, this book will certainly do. System administrators and  architects will want a more technical treatment.	2000-05-21

I have only read the first 35 pages of the 444 pages in this book. I hope it  gets better.<br />In the midst of installing Windows 2000 in a small but  complex enterprise, I brought this book home on a weekend for what I  expected would be an enjoyable opportunity to dig a little deeper into DNS.  It wasn't any fun.<br />The introductory chapter of seventeen pages is written  with little style, is poorly organized, has screen shots too small to read,  fails to state the importance and significance of DNS for the Windows  platform, and has an egregious error. According to one of the authors,  &quot;..the theoretical minimum [number of DNS servers] is one DNS server  for each branch in the domain name tree.&quot; The theoretical minimum is  one as better explained by another of the authors a few pages  later.<br />Chapter two plunges into details for which the reader is  unprepared by the introductory chapter. Please define more precisely what  &quot;domain&quot; means in the Windows 2000 architecture before throwing  it about so carelessly in nearly every paragraph. It is just not possible  to talk about the details of DNS without understanding the basic  architectures contemplated using Windows 2000's forests, trees, domains and  organizational units.<br />I am sure that the book, by its sheer weight,  will  fill in the many holes in my knowledge of DNS. But, if you are not already  well-read on Active Directory Services in Windows 2000, which depends on  DNS for locator services, this book is not the place to start.	2000-05-15

At 8 X 5-1/2 X 1-1/2 this nicely bound volume can take the abuse of being carried around in a briefcase. With 477 pages including a 20-page index you should seldom have to resort to your ten-pound complete technical  reference.

The book contains the typical  step-by-step instructions with frequent screen shots. The typesetting is  nicely done, and, like most books from Microsoft Press, the editing has  been carefully done.<br />The author assumes general familarity with a  networked Windows, if not NT, environment. It is not a planning or  installation book but a daily adminstrator's guide. If your network  planning is not complete or if Windows 2000 is not yet installed, you will  need other references.	2000-05-11

(If the archtecture has been decided, you can get  right into the Configuring book since it covers the essentials of Active  Directory.)<br />After completing the planning, &quot;Configuring&quot; will  be all you need for the initial installations. The book takes you step by  step with about one screen shot on every other page. Server installation,  hardware management, network configuration (including ADS, DNS, DHCP, WINS)  security, profiles and policies are all covered.<br />There is only limited  information on migration from UNIX or Novell. Those moving over, up, or  down (depending on your viewpoint) from those systems, may find that the  Simmons books are not what they want. (Simmons is an MCSE type guy.)<br />This  is not a &quot;dummies&quot; book, but Simons command of the material and  his clear and practiced style make the material no more difficult than it  has to be.<br />There is no CD and system administrators will need to  supplement the Simmons' books at a later date with one of the doorstopper  reference works to cover all of the options in full detail.<br />The book was  carefully edited and is nicely bound and printed.	2000-05-09

It is written for network architects and administrators who are planning to do an actual  Active Directory installation. The book becomes an installation tutorial  after the first 100 pages. The author is an experienced writer and  consultant and expert in the subject matter.<br />I used this book together  with &quot;Configuring Windows 2000 Server&quot; by the same author for  planning and installing Windows 2000 and Active Directory for a small but  sophisticated network that includes web servers and many remote users. (My  network has one forest with three trees.)<br />Active Directory Services (ADS)  is the defining new feature in Windows 2000. It provides a coordinated  database across the entire enterprise for all network objects including  workstations, servers, printers, users, and security and configuration  policies. ADS is closely integrated with DNS, and all users and  applications resort to ADS for locating and accessing resources. Well  planned, users will be able to unlock all permitted resources, located  anywhere in the enterprise, with a single logon. Mastering it before  attempting a full-scale installation is imperative since you may have to  tear down and reinstall if you make major changes to your network  topology.<br />With that in mind, I gathered a library of six Active Directory  books and read through most of each one before doing my first installation.  At only 300 pages, this is not the most complete reference in my library,  but I found it the most readable and nicely balanced between planning and  installation.<br />The companion volume on Windows 2000 Server, mentioned  above, devotes half of its 448 pages to network issues including ADS and  will be sufficient for those who want to be network administrators but not  network architects.	2000-05-06

It will serve this purpose, but it is poorly executed and filled with errors.<br />I read this book and three others on Active Directory Services in order to plan the  implementation of AD for my company. Of the four books, I liked best  another by David Iseminger on the same subject. This book, by Schwartz, was  by far the least useful of the four.<br />The book is filled with mistakes  including many editing oversights. For example, while discussing the  differing requirement of intrasite replication versus intersite  replication, the book repeatedly uses &quot;intra&quot; where  &quot;inter&quot; should have been used.<br />Diagrams that are necessary to  illustrate the various architectures possible with Active Directory are  poorly drawn and communicate poorly.<br />The book does have a useful glossary  and a CD with the complete text in PDF format, which would be handy if the  book could in any way be considered an authoritative reference.<br />Given the  wide variety of books available, you do not have to put up with this one.	2000-04-25

When confronted by young professionals who know only today's politically correct and somewhat unfavorable characterization  of Microsoft's founder, I press this book upon them and urge them to dig a  bit deeper into this fascinating personality.<br />Other newer books of  course are more complete in chronicling the growth of Microsoft, but none  covers Gates' boyhood and early Microsoft years so well. You do not know  Gates or Microsoft unless you know what both were like during the first  years of Microsoft's existence in Albuquerque from 1975 until the  relocation to the Seattle area in late 1978.<br />After reading this book I  felt I understood the essential Bill Gates. He never is going to quite grow  up, and he is always going to be a bit of a mystery to those who did not  become forever fascinated with computers by age thirteen.<br />If you are not  a Gates fan now, you may like Bill Gates (privileged son of accomplished  but non-technical parents, congressional page, avid water skier, college  poker player) a bit more after reading this. If you are an aging hacker  like me, you will smile many times at the accounts of Bill's early  fascination with a timesharing computer terminal and his amazing success  following on Microsoft's original products, adaptations of the Basic  computer language for  microcomputers beginning with the Altair.<br />I guess  you will have to be a techie to love this book as much as I do, but it is  at least essential reading for all students of the history of computer  technology. Check the index and almost all of the early pioneers are there,  from Altair's Roberts to Xerox's Metcalfe. And the photos are great!	2000-02-06

The back cover subtitles this book as an &quot;Authoritative Guide to Visual Basic 6's Most Powerful Features.&quot; This suggests an advanced programmer's handbook, a sequel to &quot;VB in 31 Days&quot; perhaps; and  the book is not that.<br />Instead, it is a well-written explanation on how to  develop with Visual Basic to fit into the world of OOP, COM, and three-tier  client/server. This book is more for system architects and designers than  for programmers. If you have a strong interest in OOP concepts and prior  understanding of VB syntax and tools, this book will help you evaluate VB  for conformance to the latest software fashions. The book is one of seven  in my library on VB, and I thoroughly enjoyed it after prior extensive  reading of the OOP gurus.

Each tutorial is followed by optional problems and case studies  that can extend each tutorial by another hour or two.<br />The book is nicely  printed in three colors on heavy 8-1/2 X 11 stock that lays flat.<br />I have  purchased four other VB study guides for my staff. This is my favorite.	1999-02-02

The title conveys well the usefulness of this book.<br />After wading through  a dozen books on the theoretical aspects of relational database design, I  was looking for a good introductory text on the actual practice of building  tables. I found this book an excellent primer.<br />I have made this book  required reading at our company for novice developers. It's a quick read  and removes the fear of atttempting database development. It's an a - z  approach, so coupled with one of the common ACCESS references, the book  provides all that is needed for single-handed developement of a  simple  project.	1998-10-29
