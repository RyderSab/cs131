Ballard has had his fingers on a strange universal pulse for many years, somehow seeing just around the corner in time.  His comments, whether in fictional form from his literary characters, or from himself in interviews, are truly unique.<br /><br />This new collection from Re/Search is like a box of psychopathology candy.  Your brain is going to be nibbling on these bits for a long time.  The collection draws from his published work, private notes, and interviews.  If the usual inspirational sayings leave you feeling rather flat, just open a page of this book and read one at random.  Chances are you will be thinking about it the rest of the day.<br /><br />The quotes are organized into topical sections including (but not limited to) The Future, The Past, Virtual Reality, Celebrity, Death, Film, Art, Technology and Science, America, Airports, Freeways, Swimming Pools, Car Crash, Sex, William S. Burroughs, and reflections by Ballard on his unique life and experiences.<br /><br />A great book for Ballard fans, those who love to discuss/debate, or anyone who likes to keep their brain dusted off.	2005-08-23

Artichokes I knew, but how was a Jerusalem artichoke different?  (turns out the first is a stem and the second is a root)<br /><br />The Vegetable Encyclopedia & Cookbook appealed to me in that not only did it break down vegetables into related families (roots, greens, shoots and stems, etc.) but it has tons of full-color pictures so I can easily identify them.  Each vegetable description also includes what to look for when buying, cutting down on the random thumping and smelling most of us do in the produce section.<br /><br />There is also an extensive recipe section, offering many variations on how to prepare the wide range of vegetables.  Not only have my own dinners at home gotten more varied and flavorful, but I usually grab this book first when planning what dish I am going to bring to potluck gatherings.  At several holiday parties, the vegetarian guests have not only thanked me for bringing vegetable dishes, but making interesting ones as well.	2005-01-02

In her first book, THE TATTOOED MAP, she weaves a story much like Bantock does.  Beautiful drawings, photographs and handwritten notes adorn the margins of Lydia Usher's journal, the book you will find yourself reading.<br />Lydia and her friend Christopher have travelled together for many years, some distance growing between them during the past several trips.  After they arrive in Morroco, Lydia gets what she thinks are flea bites on her hand.  Soon however the red markings have formed a tattoo, one that is growing up her arm.  The lines form a map, but of where or when Lydia is unsure.  And then she vanishes, leaving behind her journal, notes and photos.  Christopher is shocked and surprised at her sudden disappearance, but not as surprised as he becomes once he starts to read her journal and look for her.	2003-04-22

It's easy to see how I am going to be bringing this book with me to  every appointment with a new hairdresser.  Most stylists just do not get trained on how to cut and care for curly hair without forcing the hair to imitate straight hair.  Having fought with my hair in my youth and wanting to make peace with my curls, I share a variety of the hair stories collected in this book, primarily the one where we all wish we could get along with our curly hair.<br />The tips and info Lorraine Massey has collected in CURLY GIRL are very wide ranging, and will work for professionals as well as the hair owner.  She identifies many variations to curly hair and the differences between the types of curl.  Her cutting pointers are really spot on, and tips for controlling frizz are practical and really work.<br />I'm really looking forward to seeing what my hair becomes after reading this book.  I've experiemented with non-commercial skin care techniques before, and her theory that detergents can safely be dropped from the curly hair care routine permanently is an intriguing one.  Botticelli curls, here I come....	2003-03-31

The metal crafting, artistic modes and affectations of traditional piercings are stunning.  The more extreme examples of African body art are already missing: cutting and/or scarring, limb binding (neck/arms/legs) and lip stretching are lost arts these days.<br />The photography is top notch, with highly detailed closeups and oversize, full-color images on most pages.  Notes are included for each image, with geography, tribal information and craftsman's details for many pieces.<br />This is a great example of the &quot;coffee table&quot; book.  I checked this title out of the library while in graduate school repeatedly until my mother gifted me with my own copy (thanks, Mom!).  For artists and jewelers, this volume will be an endless source of inspiration.	2003-01-04

This vivid collection of photographs is centered around portraits taken during Mardi Gras 2001, peppered with mixed shots from other years visits.  The beauty of Mardi Gras is that it is all about showing off and being seen, a perfect natural subject for photography.<br />The calm muted portrait background of McCaffety's photo booth provides a blessed quiet space where all manner of characters can shine in all their secret-persona-glory-revealed!  Makeup, masks, sequins, glitter, tulle, stripes, spots, spangles, and beads, beads, and more beads!  From whimsical to &quot;what the heck?&quot;, McCaffety catches it for the just needed moment of capture so it can be shared here.<br />If you'd rather skip the crowds, pull up a chair and relax with the masking and the madness in this book.	2003-01-02

What do you define as body art?  This book covers tattooing, piercing, scarification, branding, hair dressing (head and pubic) and shaving, finger and toe nails, body building, plastic surgery and gender identity.  The catalog is extensive but still retains a warm, intimate feeling.  The portraits are sepia tone, showing many variations on what it is to be individual.<br />Good for the beginner as this volume will provide an excellent overview of body art.  Valuable for the collector due to the quality of the portraits and breadth of body art depicted, supported by the personal and intelligent commentary.	2003-01-02

This overlap set an ominous tone that then went from bad to worse, from the frying pan to the fire and somehow a film came out the other side.<br />The making of the movie \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\" is told via Andrew Yule's interviews and research, almost a post-mortem after the near-death experience of the filmmaking process.  Director and producer fought, crews walked or were fired, accountants and accusations flew, and tigers and elephants literally got out of control.  Compared to \\"The Battle of Brazil\\" that was a skirmish and this was a world war.<br />For Gilliam fans, join the director in all his pain as he attempts to surmount and juggle language barriers, lethargic crews, bad weather, financial disputes, mysterious accidents, casts of characters fictional and real, and his own visions.	2002-12-30

This book has these elements, but no pictures for a change.  Edited by Kim Addonizio and Cheryl Dumesnil, both tattooed, this is a written depiction of tattooing.  The collection includes fiction, personal memoirs, poetry and anecdotes on the physical experience and lifestyle choice to have skin art.  The title comes from the historical fact that writer Dorothy Parker had a star permanently inked on one arm.<br />The excerpt from Bradbury's &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; will be remembered as familiar and formative to many tattoo fans.  Artists write about what it was like to learn to tattoo and related various ink-related adventures with a wide array of wild customers.  Concentration camp survior Paul Steinberg describes his involuntary tattoo experience.  Mastectomy survior Deena Metzger's tattoo falls at the other end of the ink spectrum as part of her chosen healing process.  There are tales of joy, sorrow, smart choices, drunken moments, good ink and bad.<br />The short lengths of the pieces makes reading this on transit or during those short breaks during the day easy, and the subject matter is a great distraction from the mundane.  A definite book for the collection of those who write about tattooing, or are looking for some more historical perspective.	2002-11-15

If you think everyone now has a tattoo or a piercing, ask yourself how many people do you know with a branding or cutting?  Do any of your friends have implants?  Do you think your body might be improved by amputation?  This is area of the world where MODCON takes the reader.<br />ModCon, a private convention/gathering of extreme body art enthusiasts and artists, is documented in this volume of interviews and pictures, with some material coming from the author's private collection.  You will see implants, surgical alterations and every form of permanent skin art, all modifications and changes made at the wishes of the wearer.  The pictures are highly-detailed, full-color and sometimes disturbingly graphic in their medical nature.<br />As a person who has collected body art for almost twenty years now, I have seen a lot of unique people.  I bought this book because it went beyond anything I have seen before.  The interviews reveal an incredible array of focus and desire when it comes to why everyone is doing these things, as well as varying, and sometimes scary, degrees of will to carry out the mental vision for the physical body.  If you want a book that will confront you with questions and shake up your perceptions about humans and how they view and use their bodies, this is one of the ones.  Collectors of &quot;the extreme&quot; should also take note.	2002-11-15

However, BUSHIDO has changed all that, and I am overly excited once again.  This volume is a showcase of modern Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, as recorded and written by client and student Takahiro Kitamura.  Kitamura is able to describe the unique position that tattooing occupies, somewhere between traditional and modern techniques, as well as balancing between Japanese and Western stylings, and ancient and post-modern belief systems underlying it all.<br />The photography is by Katie Kitamura, wife of the author.  Her pictures are reproduced mostly in full-color plates, focusing on the overall aesthetic along with lots of the details.  The models are both men and women, of varying ages and stages of coverage.  Full portraits are complimented with more closely cropped photos, enlarging complexly-patterned details, subtle shading and expressive faces.  A lexicon of body areas with the traditional Japanese names for the style of body coverage along with names for the styles of fill and background is a unique highlight.<br />A rare and difficult find, worth every effort it takes to get this one into your tattoo book collection.	2002-09-25

The collection, while titled with a body art slant, looks more like a group of celebrity photos where everyone just happens to have some body art, rather than focusing directly on it.  Many of the tattoos could have been showcased more if the portraits had been posed for that purpose instead of being collected from previous publications.  Written material about the celebs and their tats is of mixed length and quality.  Overall, this is more like a book of celebrity tattoos for the dentist's office, and not a great addition to the tattoo library that it could have been.	2002-08-20

Tiring of his tech and real estate reports, he turned his writing to the evolution of modern Japan during the \\"bubble\\" ecomony.  He was able to observe first-hand the growth and decadence of youth culture during this vibrant period.<br />Greenfeld touches upon the clash between Western influence and traditional Japanese culture.  His blend of fiction and non-fiction take us along with a group of Japanese and foreign young people trying to find their place in present-day Japan. Facets explored include gang culture, the porn industry, drug trafficking, the vast industry of stolen motorcycles, and many more aspects not normally reported upon in the West.	2002-07-01

For the average film viewer, chances are the only film they will have seen or heard of in this book is \\"In the Realm of the Senses.\\" For the Japanese film connoisseur, this book is one of THE handbooks.<br />Chapters detail film genres along with specific directors who have shaped the modern Japan film industry. There are also tons of black and white pictures, showing personalities as well as scenes from the many movies.	2002-07-01

She was so very right!<br />J. De Merlin's FEMMES MACHINES is a black and white collection of fetish photos.  The settings and imagery are nothing like what is usually portrayed as \\"fetish.\\"  Dungeons and black leather are for the most part absent.  Many of the settings are living room and bathroom settings in nature with MANY unusual medial props.  However, the most unusual feature of De Merlin's work is that all of the models faces are obscured with enlarged images of facial parts or replaced by masks made of facial pictures.<br />The strong soft-core to hardcore imagery is stunning.  Repeated viewings of the pictures reveals subtle details and allows the reader to explore the emotional content behind the applied faces.	2002-07-01

Subtitled \\"A Compendium of Phycho-Physiological Investigation,\\" what you get in the Amok Journal's SENSURROUND EDITION is a collection of reports, articles and general research on autoerotic fatalities, trepanation, Gualtiero Jacopetti, cargo cults, Neue Slowenische Kunst, self-mutilation and amputee fetishism, infrasound and a collection of true emergency room reports called \\"Psych-Out.\\"<br />All of the material presented here is true.  Some of it seems unbelievable but all the reports here are covering behaviors that these people were engaging in willingly (even some of the fatal ones) for the purpose of having some sort of heightened sensory experience.  Nearly all of this behavior does NOT involve drugs, focusing more on altered experience through altered body state.<br />Not for the easily squeamish.  Despite the extreme subject matter, this volume is highly intelligent and an amazing psychological peek into the fringes of human experiences.	2002-06-02

His &quot;eye&quot; is unique, finding tiny moments and details in the midst of the busy world and capturing them, often unusually framed or cropped, in ways that are unconventional.  People, color and places are photographed in ways that draw you into the pictures, wishing you could ask Mortensen where he was, or what it was that he saw that made him choose to take the picture he took.<br />Painting is a more recent artistic expression for him, and he has commented that he likes to take works in progress with him on film shoots, working on them in his off-set hours, letting the different colors and places shape what he paints.  Images, words and colors are combined in his canvases, often layered, reworked and scratched over.<br />The collection of photos and painting in SIGNLANGUAGE are primarily from 1999-2001, during which time Mortensen was working in New Zealand during the shoots for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Portraits include some of his costars, landscapes are often from locations throughout New Zealand.  Some of the most interesting portraits are from Viggo's favorite ongoing subject: his son Henry.  The paintings are most abstract, blending written words, color and shapes.<br />The images in this collection are full of wonder and color.  If you can't catch one of the gallery shows of Mortensen's work, this is an excellent way to share his travels and vision.	2002-05-23

Nearly 60 years later, this boy is now a man named Fakir Musafar, who coined the term &quot;modern primitive&quot; and who teaches piercing and leads shamanic rituals in northern California and around the world.<br />Collected here are images Musafar has taken of himself and friends as they have experimented personally, using body modification methods as a way of exploring themselves and as an alternative to other methods of achieving altered states of consciousness for spiritual growth.  This is a high quality publication, the first monograph focusing on Musafar's photography of these journeys.  Many of the images are intense, closeup and highly personal.  For those unfamiliar with modern-day body modification, some of the images (body piercing, kavandi bearing, ball dancing) may be shocking or uncomfortable.<br />In the past, Fakir contributed to underground publications, or produced his own small books, or his more recent magazine &quot;body play&quot; as a way of showing his art and photography.  Even if you have been seeking out and collecting these random small publication, this is the definitive collection of this artist's work.

The results of her efforts is a lovely book of recipes for scrubs, rinses and tonics utilizing food as a means of cleansing and moisturizing.<br />Ingredients include beans, vegetables and teas, most of which can ecomonically be found at grocery stores. With a small bit of devoted effort, these items are prepared to make facial scrubs, shampoo, moisturizers and other cleansing basics. As most ingredients can be found in organic forms, this would be a good book for those with sensitivities to commerical products that are laden with perfumes and dyes. Costs for these homemade preparations are a fraction of what you pay in a store for prepared products!<br />After just a few days of using the Pearl Barley and Pink Bean Powder face wash, it became apparent how lovely these recipes are. A few friends were induced to also try the scrub and immediately everyone noticed how smooth and supple their freshly washed skin was. Dry skin was softer, oily skin less stimulated, and sensitive faces were clear and fresh without irritation.<br />This book has easy to follow instructions for skin and body care routines for all skin types. For people who want to move away from commerical and animal-based cleansing products, or just switch to a more natural form of beauty care, this is THE book!	2002-05-08

In the world created here by McDonald, nanotechnolgy has led to a method for reanimating dead people.  Unfortunately, those reincarnated get to spend eternity as a vast slave/labor class, supporting the world of the living.<br />Needless to say, this sets up a predictable scenario of rebellion.  However, where that scenario goes is unpredictable and, in my opinion, quite interesting.  Author McDonald has created a lush &quot;dead&quot; culture, and most of the story takes place in the Necroville of Tijuana on the night before and day of &quot;Day of the Dead.&quot;  The main characters are a group of artists who meet in the titular cafe annually on this holiday to catch up with each other.<br />The details and substory lines grow and expand for the first half of the book, making it a bit hard to keep everyone and all their actions sorted out.  For the second half, it begins an ever-tightening spiral, pulling all the details and characters back together until their final reunion.<br />Cyberpunk flavor without being too self-referential of the genre.  The language has a lot of Spanish influences due to the setting and it provides a nice mix of feelings and expressions.	2002-04-16

However, this is often a misunderstood art, an ancient craft that can convey a variety of meanings and experiences for those that choose to explore it, whether you opt to tie or be tied.<br />You have an excellent instructor in hand here.  Midori draws from her childhood upbringing in Japan, her education in psychology, and her experience as a SM player and educator to provide the information presented in this fantastic new publication.  You learn the historical place and perspective of rope in Japan, both as an everyday tool and a modern erotic practice, as well as the evolution of rope play in the US.<br />A variety of traditional Japanese rope ties are both described and illustrated, along with some stunning full-color photos by Craig Morey.  Selection and care of rope is covered in good detail, along with basic safety and specific rope bondage concerns.  The various positions are presented as consensual, erotic and fun, with some of the easiest and clearest instructions I've ever seen.  Models are all ages, shapes, sizes, genders and ethnicities:  a most refreshing change from the usual depictions of these practices.<br />For lovers of restraint in any form, this is an elegant and necessary edition to your library and play life.	2002-01-16

A friend who enjoys strong, sexy women, and who thinks of me as such, gave it to me.  If you like said women, you will enjoy having this calendar.<br />The pairing with his wife seems to have brought a softer edge to the muscular women that I've seen Vallejo portray in the past, and I enjoy the strong-but-not-overwhelming body forms these women have.  The theme for 2002 is The Return of the Goddess.  The women shown each month portray victory, victim, warrior, sorceress, spirit and more.<br />The imagery is neither overly violent, nor overly sexual.  The functional part of the calendar includes clean boxes with large print numbers.  Special notations include the basic UK/US holidays.	2002-01-06

Bring Balinese temple statues home	Don't let the title fool you...;-)  STONED IMAGES is a beautiful collection of full-color photos of Balinese temple statues by Hans Hoefer, reproduced with spectacular values on the renowned Paper Tiger imprint.  Although he is no longer involved, Paper Tiger was started by British designer-illustrator Roger Dean.<br />Hoefer has captured the evolution of sacred relics.  As he points out, many of these figures have been changed by their jungle environment and no longer sport the colorful paint and gilt of their original splendor.  However, the fine details and fanciful faces haven't lost much with the addition of creeping vines or a gentle coating of soft moss.<br />Hoefer also includes a bit of background on Balinese art, the age old craft of sculpting as practiced in Bali, use of native materials, etc. so those of us who just got the book get a bit more out of what we are seeing.<br />A good addition for sculptors or artists who keep reference libraries, also a good addition for fans of Dean's Paper Tiger publishing.	2001-12-15

Whether you have followed fashion religiously, or tried to run in the opposite direction as fast as you can, you will want to get your hands on a copy of this book. You will never look at your closet or wardrobe quite the same after this....<br />Taken from five years of one of Japan's leading youth/pop fashion magazines, FRUITS is page after full-color page of individually dressed Japanese (mostly) teenagers from the Harajuku district. What Westerners think of as fashion has only existed in Japan for the last fifty years, and didn't become truly fashionable until the 1980s and 1990s. The young people in this book are experimenting with clothing and image as hard as they know how. No combination is forbidden, be it color or pattern-related. No trend is untrendy, no color to bright/dark/pale, no hair color left unexplored, no shoes to big, no kitsch to kitschy, etc.<br />What we see here are the last 40 years of Western fashion, made accessible and popular almost simultaneously to a non-Western culture. The melding and contrast are individually unique, made more so by the standard name, age, and point of fashion questions asked of each model. I've studied fashion and have a degree in costume so I've seen lots of experimental or future fashion, but all of it pales compared to the fertile pages of FRUITS.	2001-12-05

Rarely have I repeated a type of calendar subject as there are so many things I like, but the Witches' Calendar 2001 worked so well for me that I just had to go with the 2002 edition for the coming year.<br />This calendar covers the sabbaths and esbats of Wicca, along with the eight major pagan holidays, astrological transits, relevant Wiccan celebrations, birthdays, handfastings, foundings and much more. Each year also incorporates a selection of articles on related subjects, with this year's topics including the three-fold law, Harry Potter, working with dreams, symbology of the pentagram, legal rights of pagans, solitary witches, masks, magickal names, the spiritual role of teacher, herbalism, serving ritual-specific foods, and participation at public rituals.<br />Overall, a great reference and fun calendar for Pagans or Wiccans.	2001-11-13

Vale and co-interviewer John Sulak is MODERN PAGANS. Subtitled \\"an investigation of contemporary pagan practices\\" this collection of interviews with 39 figures in the modern pagan movement is insightful and interesting, as with all Re/Search topics. The people are intelligent, earth-loving, and warm, pursuing paganism and/or Wicca via many individualistic paths. There are many common themes among those interviewed: respect for the earth and green practices, alternative and extended family structures, compassion for humankind and the desire for the betterment of all.<br />This collection of conversations is a glimpse of certain facets of the modern pagan movement/community. Due to Vale's San Francisco-base, the participants are slightly Bay Area/northern California-centric, although there are representations from around the US and the UK. The beliefs discussed are predominantly modern Wicca, especially people associated with the Bay Area Reclaiming group.<br />The photography is, again, as good as the interviews. In keeping with the pagan belief in life as a circle, the photos with each inteview show the subjects as children, teens and adults. The personal evolutions are quite varied and beautiful.	2001-11-12

The interaction of man and technology is one of Ballard's favorite topics, and here we see the explorations of man and the automobile.  With the birth of the freeway, Ballard somehow looks forward, correctly imagining the future role of the car as surrogate partner and habitat for humanity, laboratory of pathology.  Vaughn and his black Lincoln are a rolling experiment, blurring the separation of driver and vehicle.  Set in London, the story seems to be unconciously channeling the American/Californian car experience, where life is what you live in your car and your house is where you store your belongings.  The victim of a car accident, the titular Ballard and his wife Catherine are drawn to Vaughn and his pursuit of the perfect car wreck, trying to expand and explore their own lives in the wake of their experiences following Ballard's crash.  A unique psychological exploration, made into an equally excellent movie by David Cronenberg starring Elias Koteas and James Spader, with many passages preserved intact from the original novel.	2001-10-26

Traven/Travis/Tallis/etc. appears as one man, moving through different evolutionary experiments, physical and psychological. He is experimenting with his psyche, as Ballard experiments with storytelling and writing. Chapter headings like \\"The University of Death,\\" \\"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\\" and \\"You and Me and the Continuum\\" give an idea towards the scope of the characters' inner and outer explorations.  The experimental sexual interactions, recurring alternate deaths and celebrity obsessions are from lists produced by Ballard using free assocation. Glimpses of themes of many of his later works can be found in this text.<br />Special features of the Re/Search revised edition includes an introduction by William S. Burroughs, new notes and comments from Ballard, and four additional short stories. Notes and commentary from Ballard himself run in the margins alongside the text to which they are related.  The collection of medical illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner is impressive. Often overlooked are the excellent black and white urban images, photographed by Ana Barrado.  Her pictures are purposefully \\"Ballardesque,\\" showing abandoned parking lots, beaches and launch sites.	2001-10-23

Ballard's latest setting for speculative fiction.  Paul Sinclair just lost his pilot's license, and is moving with his young wife, Jane, who has just taken the pediatrician's position at the multinational business park and planned community.  At first the only hesitation the couple has is that the gentleman who &quot;vacated&quot; Jane's post did so following a killing spree amongst his neighbors.<br />Upon their arrival, everything seems perfect, too perfect.  Slowly, the veneer begins to peel away.  Why were they put into the deceased Dr. Greenwood's house?  Why won't anyone talk about the terrible tragedy?  Where do all the husbands and business men go at night in their matching leather bowling jackets?  And just what is Dr. Wilder Penrose, resident psychiatrist, doing with his &quot;recreational therapy&quot; program?<br />Driven by curiousity, and then fear for himself and his wife, Paul begins an investigation of his own, or is his just part of Penrose's alternative program?<br />An excellent view into the warping of modern, technological life.  Despite being set in France, this tale plays more like a subtle American reality.  A gentle and creeping psychological thriller, much like Ballard's last novel, Cocaine Nights.	2001-10-18

Creating a sucessor to VIEWS is a hard enough concept, but Roger Dean has produced another master document of his work.  Following along the same path as his first book, again we get the album size/shape presentation and tons of full color reproductins of Dean's sketches and renderings.  This book was the first whereby I truly grasped Dean's illustrations as architechtural renderings, as lots of the projects covered in this volume are 3D projects worked on with his brother Martyn:  built YES stages, modelling retreat pods and designing home and buildings.  Imagine a YES album cover as a dwelling, and grab this book to show you how and why it is possible.  Stunning follow-up, fantastic production values not seen often in modern paperbacks.	2001-10-13

I acquired this book when I was in high school, having just discovered Monty Python.  I was fascinated by the strange cutout animations that joined the skits, and that's what drew me to the book originally.  Now, it is a rare, classic treasure.  Mainly, it is a book overviewing cutout animation.  The fun part is the documenting of a body of work that Gilliam has now moved away from as a film director.  There are a few political cartoons, not used for Python, and some pages of raw sketches that show the darker side of animation.  Plus, as a bonus, you get a running gag about a black spot and a badger that keep trying to hijack the actual book as you read it....  Technically beneficial to animators, a Holy Grail of acquisitions to Gilliam fans.	2001-10-13

Andrea Juno and V. Vale collected a series of intervies with Flanagan and his partner/mistress Sheree Rose about his life and their alternative lifestyle choices.  Flanagan is a poet, writer, performance artist and musician, along with trying to create a 24/7 submissive and masochistic life scenario with Rose, all while trying to survive the ever increasing damage to his lungs and body from cystic fibrosis.  He fights his pain with pain, and overall, has a very powerful, rich life.  The presentation of such intense erotic detail comes across as natural and normal in the relaxed conversations of Vale and Juno with Flanagan, his friends and family.	2001-10-09

Written by the group founder/leader, Freak Like Me covers Rose's childhood in Phonenix, getting teased for being cross-eyed and always being tied up while playing cowboys and Indians.  Years later, working as an exterminator, Rose hands in his bug sprayer and heads to Europe, picking up the fine art of street performing along the way.  Freak Like Me covers the birth of the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow in 1991, and follows it through various incarnations up to the tour with Nine Inch Nails in 1994.  The book has tons of pictures and descriptons of plenty of things you shouldn't do at home:  as Rose intones in his show &quot;go over to your friend's house to practice until you get really good.&quot;  A bit Rose-centric at times, this is nevertheless an excellent look at the post-modern sideshow.	2001-10-03

The book covers mid 1991 through 1993 (Gregor's tenure), with notes from many of the groups tour dates of this time.

From acclaimed artist and storyteller Nick Bantock, comes the fourth installment of his famed series, &quot;In Which the Extraordinary Correspondence of Griffin &amp; Sabine Is Rediscovered.&quot; Matthew Sedon is an archaeologist working in Egypt, writing postcards and letters to his girlfriend in Paris, Isabella de Reims. One day, Matthew receives a letter from Sabine Strohem, soon followed by copies of her entire correspondence with Griffin Moss. Join Isabella and Matthew as they try and unravel the mystery: is this a real conversation between two people, or an elaborate fiction? And why does it all seem to parallel their own relationship? As always, Bantock's artistry is impeccable, and the postcards and pull-out letters are as beautiful and fun as they have been over the entire series of books. The story is so complex and rich it makes sense to those new to the series, and does not disappoint for die-hard fans.	2001-09-09

I got that last week and just devoured it, it's amazing!&quot; I exclaimed, not realizing I had just approached the author and totally made her day. Humans come in an incredible array of shapes and sizes, and so do their turn-ons. Katherine Gates, known for her past collaborations with porn-performance-artist Annie Sprinkle, overviews a variety of practices that occupy the outer edges of sexuality, but flourish on the Internet. Balloon fetishists (to pop or not to pop, that is the question), people who like to pretend they are ponies, fat admirers and messy girls are all collected here, shown in happy, consensual pictures and interviews. This book will be of interest to fetishists, social anthropologists, sex counselors/educators and collectors of the unusual.	2001-08-30

Most individuals with this disease of the lungs don't make it out of childhood, but with a combination of strength, humor and a bit of S&amp;M, Flanagan survived to be 43, almost unheard of even in this medical age. This book is literally a diary he kept during the last year of his life. Best known as the subject of &quot;Bob Flanagan: Supermasochist&quot;, there isn't much kink or S/M in this. This is a man dealing with mortality, reviewing his past life, trying to accomplish all he has set out for himself before he is gone. At that same time that this journal was being written, a documentary was being made, which would eventually be called &quot;Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan&quot; and it won the Sundance Special Grand Prize in 1997. This journal is an excellent companion to the film, and a final view of the man in his own words.	2001-08-30

New Orleans and NYC provided moist atmospheres for expression, much of that 'caught' here by Gatewood. While on assignment for Rolling Stone in London, Gatewood got to hang with Burroughs and Gysin. That meeting fruited into Burroughs providing the text. To compliment the images perfectly, read the words in your head using Burroughs distinctive, grating rasp.	2001-08-23

This story of teens seemingly smothered with caring who rebel against the planned community they live in is yet another eerie prediction of the present, set in Britian in the story, yet it seems to be actually happening right now in the US.  A cool, who-and-how-dunnit, I read this book at a quick pace, following the Scotland Yard investigator as he builds his unorthodox theories of what happened.  More accessible that some of his global disaster novels, this is a good book for those new to Ballard, and a great addition to the collection for fans.	2001-07-23

Although many of the story concepts repeat the theme of the tragic female figure and the tortured man who loves her and gets caught in the dramatic conflict, it is a lush and expansive vision that weaves through the collection.  The title refers to a fictional beach resort, a playground of burnt out executives and movie stars at play, or in retreat from the rest of the world.  As with most Ballard fiction, you get the distinct impression that these stories are actually taking place somewhere, and perhaps Ballard has just changed the names to protect the decadent.  The vivid details of living clothing, cloud sculptors and singing sculptures are so intense, it's a bit of a surprise that Hollywood hasn't adapted some of these stories to the currently CGI movie craze.  Then again, like most of what Ballard writes about, that could be coming just around the corner...	2001-07-23

This book is the penultimate freak show romance, mixed with a detective story, peppered with bizarre-o-rama.  The perfect gift for that off-beat someone in the family.  The story keeps slithering along, moving quickly and keeping you tightly in hand for the whole ride.  Grab your popcorn... ;-)	2001-07-09

The original printing of Gatewood's Forbidden Photographs quickly sold out when it first debuted in 1981.  At that point, Gatewood had spent nearly 20 years exploring scenes that were, then, totally underground.  Bikers, tattoos, the late 60s sexual revolution.  This books is also a bit of a historical document at this point, including such alternative scene celebs as Annie Sprinkle, Marco Vassi and tattooist Spider Webb, all contemporaries and collaborators with Gatewood during his New York residence.  Images draw from New Orleans Mardi Gras, the NY disco scene and what would grow to become the Modern Primitive movement of the 90s.  A worthy addition to anyone's alternative press collection...	2001-03-17

The images are beautiful and elegantly composed, some  coming from nature, some from man-composed settings.  Each month has a  topic such as chi, mirrors, health, discernment, silence, intention,  creation and truth.  Along with the image comes an inspirational quote, and  a practical exercise.<br />As a calendar, it has big boxes to write in, and  is easy to read from across the kitchen while talking on the phone and  stirring dinner on the stove.  It also indicates a wide variety of holidays  and has the moon cycle marked with icons.	2000-09-17

Ballard	Books	4	16	17	N	Y	Good Angle on Ballard with Angle Between Two Walls	I read the only information that Amazon had posted on this title, a seemingly dry academic table of contents, and decided to go for it.  I was desperately curious to see what kind of analysis this was about Ballard,  and my chance was richly rewarded.  I do have one caveat:  this IS a dense  academic analysis.  As an intense Ballard fan and possessing a graduate  degree, I fell in love with the book.  As author Roger Luckhurst points  out, Atrocity Exhibition is a hard title to have a discussion about.  If  you've been searching for someone to analyze Ballard with, get this title  and join Roger.<br />The title refers to Ballard's nebulous place between  mainstream and science fiction, the &quot;angle between two walls.&quot;  Luckhurst points out the attempts that have been made to categorize  Ballard, but that's the last thing he is attempting to do here.  Instead  Luckhurst focuses on several of the major themes and processes at work  inside Ballard's fiction: surrealism, globalism, catastrophe.  The chapter  analyzing Vermilion Sands was amazing.  Reading Roger discuss the  readability AND unreadability of Ballard's work, I knew I had found a  kindred Ballardian.  Hardcore fans, this is the second most required  about-Ballard title after the Re/Search #8/9 Ballard book.	2000-07-22
