I enjoyed this book although it's unlike anything I've ever read from Patterson before. Set in France in a time of castles, kings, and tyrants (1096), an unlikely innkeeper becomes a jester, a war hero, and a great leader of men. You'll love the main character Hugh de Luc and enjoy all the unexpected twists and turns his life takes. The book is a great adventure.	2003-04-11

It's like sitting down with an old friend and walking away feeling renewed. It will change your perspective on things - if you let it!<br />With the Iraq war on TV everyday now, and the NY job market being what it is - I am guilty of letting myself feel that some things are beyond my control (need I admit it? - perhaps a little helpless). Steve helped to remind me that I do have full control over the way I perceive and feel about these outside factors and what effect I let them have on my life.<br />Yesterday before reading his book, I was feeling a little beaten down and today I feel empowered.

I've heard so many good things about this book and was really excited to read it. The excitment quickly died when I started to read it. It reminds me of some of the worst text books I read in college. You know the type dry and packed with meaningless terms that you'd memorized for a test and quickly forget. This not a straight forward get down to business book. The author could of done a much better job in making this an enjoyable read, rather than a painful one. If you dig terms like crucible and disintermediation - go for it. I gave it 2 stars because it does have a message if you can ignore the over complicated way it's presented.	2003-02-20

This book is a sad statement about the # of women who get raped in America, and how few report it, or seek/get a conviction. A sad statement about how a rape victim is victimized again and again throughout the reporting process and legal process.<br />This book, in many ways reminds me of the books I read about the Holocaust.

When you forget how to do a certain something, or you need to do something you've never done before - look it up & you will almost always find something on the subject you are searching for.

For me it was too much of an information dump with too little hands-on to really get me started. This book does not get to creating an amination until Chapter 9 (page 160) & scares you many times before you get there that the process is sooooo complex! I bought this book to learn & gain confidence not to have it taken away.<br />To get myself out of the slump, I purchased Flash MX Training from The Source & received a wonderful step-by-step learn-by-doing, jump-right-in approach that gave me the knowledge and confidence I was looking for. The source book gets you up & animating in chapter 4, and includes a good foundation on scripting throughout. <br />However, in it's defense, Flash MX Savvy covers a lot of ground & it's definately a good reference - it just wasn't a good starting point for me to sink my teeth into.	2002-08-28

Stella finds herself married to the rather dull forensic psychiatrist Max Raphael; they have a child named Charlie. Life is good yet predictable. They move into a house on the grounds of the asylum where Max works. Stella always feels like a woman playing the role of staff wife and mother. It's a skin that never seems to fit (very similar to Nora in Isben's \\"A Doll House\\"). When she lays eyes on Edgar Stark she is at once completely lost and found. Edgar is the forbidden fruit, a dark dangerous and sexy patient in residence. He awakens a hunger so forceful Stella could not - would not ignore. The reckless decisions she makes slowly destroys the prison that was her life leaving her no choice but to continue moving ahead.  Away from Max who treats her like a fragile lady; towards Edgar who treats her like a woman and makes her feel alive! Although they all meet a rather tragic end, what a ride!	2002-01-21

The apple of her charismatic drunken father's eye, pitied by her mother, Francie is an every day hero. Her parents try their dreadful best to give their children more than they had. You want to hate them but you can't. She is a piece of everyone we know. A young girl who is alone and loves to read to escape the life & circumstances she has little control over. So many who read this book feel that the book was written about them. I mentor an inner-city student who I will definately pass this book onto. It offers hope that no matter how we start out in life we can all survive and achieve. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger! A great book for teens.	2002-01-18

He seems like a loveable, strong character, a good deputy sheriff, & a good father until his gets a lead on who may have killed his wife & he totally loses it! I think the desperation which dictates Miles actions speaks volumes of his love for his wife & the pain he & his son have lived with since they lost her. In the end, MIles gets control of himself and pulls all the pieces of his life back together, making some very hard & noble decisions along the way. I liked the story & the characters! Sparks reminds us that our actions can either be destructive or constructive..the choice is always ours. (PS I don't think Sparks intended to keep the killer a secret. He let's you \\"guess\\" with certainty because the confessions carry more weight when you understand who the killer is and how his crime may not only have ruined Miles life with Missy, but may ruined his chances of making a fresh start). A great story for the holidays!	2001-12-18

If you are the type of person who likes to understand the reasoning behind given suggestions - don't bother with this one. If you can blindly follow directions, without knowing why - go for it. In summary, it's a quick read and may serve to spark someones interest in the subject but that's all folks.	2001-12-13

I don't want to give anything away, so I'll simply say you won't have enough information to solve this mystery until Meltzer reveals all. The ending had me calling &quot;foul&quot;. The death was an interesting turn but should of been further developed with a little aftermath of the politics and news frenzy in true Washington style. A little clean up would have went a long way. I think the last chapter was omitted! : ) Grisham is still my man!	2001-12-13

Regarding: audible's audio version of this book, unabridged &amp; narrated by the talented Scott Brick (25 hours &amp; not a boring detail). Scott makes Corey's character really come alive! Followed by an interview with Nelson Demille about the writting of the book. <br />What a story! What wonderful main characters! I started reading this book after 9/11/01 and was stunned at how current &amp; chilling the story is. This book is a must read (or listen!) Provides good insight into the mind of a terrorist. Excellent, intriguing game of cat &amp; mouse.	2001-12-05

This book is highly motivating &amp; gives you many reasons to remove the clutter (&amp; stagnation) from your life; especially by helping you understand why you allowed the clutter into your life &amp; why it may be hard to left go of. Is it a fix all? No. Will you become an instant wiz in clean? No. Will it motivate you to clear your clutter? YES! I read it right before I cleaned a room I was having trouble with and found the motivation I needed. Unfortunately, the room is quite a mess again! : ) I will go back to this book to gain the motivation to try again. : ) I lent this book to my mom - who has a definate problem with clutter &amp; it motivated her too! As with any postive changes, if at first you don't succeed...(read!) With the help of this book, I will keep trying. Good luck to you!	2001-11-06

However, you get the feeling that these words are definitely Melissa's own. Basic honest details of her many escapades (& a few relationships along the way). Some interesting things she experienced. Although I love Melissa, all the details of the chicks she picked up along the way had me, at times, thinking \\"this is a little more than I really wanted to know\\" : ) As in her music - she bares her soul - revealing her deep hunger & clinging need to be loved unconditionally. She is definately her own worse critic. In the end you have to love and respect her. She told the truth and she is always searching for self-improvement.	2001-07-29

It seemed like the author forgot she was writting a novel &amp; got lost in her own thoughts. The 2nd half of the book is non-sense and her evaluating her diagnosis years later.  More of a reporting than a novel. For once, the movie will be better - it  has to be! : )	2000-03-14

He's always been able to write it in as an interesting  part of the story. This time it was so predictable and dry - every time  something technical is explained it's to begrudgingly train the new  guy...boring.	1999-05-25

It didn't teach me everything I need to know about personal finances but it did give me a great overview and motivate me to read more on the topic. <br />It also motivated me to take immediate action on the things I could change. Like increasing my 401K deduction, getting more involved with my investments - however small they may be, listening to myself about what feels right, &amp; treating my money with respect to attract more.  <br />Not my usual idea of a fun read - but it was truly painless : ) ENJOY!	1998-07-07
