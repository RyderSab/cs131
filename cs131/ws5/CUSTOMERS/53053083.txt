She does not present it as a panacea but describes the benefits of her approach. The author says she's left-brained and must plan her novels. She also says she must start with the main characters first, and after they are well devloped the story nearly writes itself. She also believes in researching out her setting because she wants the settings to be be as realistic as possible. She may combine the descriptions of several real buildings into one scene. I think her discussions of characters, setting, and her overall process are the best parts of her book. <br /> <br />Her process can be summarized as: come up with the Idea for the story, develop it further into an Expanded Idea (read the book for details),  invent the Primary Initiating Event, derive the initial cut of the Characters, develop detailed Biographies for them, Research the story (how to do it), create the Characters, create the Settings, create a Step Outline (phrases for each of 15 or so scenes, all scenes placed on one page), then create a Plot Outline (stream-of-consciousness expansion of each scene), write the Rough Draft, do a Fast Read, write an Editorial Letter to yourself describing the deep changes needed, Second Revision, have the Second Draft read by an informed reader (the Cold Reader), do a Third Draft, mail it off. <br /> <br />There's much more than this process discussed: dialog, subtexting, THAD's, etc. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book very much and was most pleased with the practical advice by this author. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-07-16

His Online videos make it a 5	This book is a cleaned-up presentation by the author, Robert Olen Butler. On that basis it's certainly worth a 5 star rating. But I would expect most people buying this book expect more of a traditional presentation. Still, the lecture format, with extemporaneous examples, helps you understand the process.  It's like a form of showing rather than telling. I actually liked the format, but other readers might not. <br /> <br />I can see how one reviewer states that the author is better in the short story form. The author evangelizes a right-brain approach of emotional writing that contains \\"no abstraction, no generalization, no summary, no analysis, no interpretation.\\" I think this approach is excellent in short fiction. But, there are additional important issues that come to play in long forms of fiction. <br /> <br />The book offers a detailed look at writing the \\"right-brained\\" and \\"emotional\\" way. And thus, we find the title: From Where You Dream. The author says all fiction should originate from your dreams, not from your mind. There are exercises that almost explain this process. The reader has to ponder and analyze a lot to get the full benefit of this book, which is not bad in itself. But this is greatly offset by following the link to the author's online video presentations. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT! Where else can you get a chance to listen to a noted author and watch him create a short story on the fly? <br /> <br />This approach is so valuable, and the philosophy and the techniques presented so workable that this book will prove valuable for all readers. To become the \\"master of the sensual moment\\" will require repeated readings of this transcription of the author's workshops. He has put some of these presentations online and points you to his website. This is quite an addition and synergy to such a book giving a transcription. <br /> <br />One warning: he's quite dogmatic with a logic that goes, \\"If you don't believe X, then you aren't an artist.\\" But this just makes his book a little spicy. <br /> <br />All in all, I found the reading most enjoyable and I have returned to it many times. The downside is that you have to expend a little effort prying out the key points. But I believe the results are worthwhile. The addition of the website lectures turn this book from very good to great. The author, an instructor at Florida State University, presents his ideas convincingly and clearly. I wish all authors would include online video presentations... like the extra trailers on DVD's. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-07-16

It is doubtful that anyone decided to choose a spouse based on some type of quantitative matrix.  <br /> <br />The authors, Eileen Shapiro and Howard Stevenson, lay out a twelve point methodology revolving around key questions that must be answered before a businessperson decides to take a business risk. <br /> <br />They suggest that it's more important to cover all twelve of the questions quickly than going into just a few deeply. I found their questions and methodology helpful and the book was easy and fun to read. Some of their points were a reminder of obvious things, but the framework of all twelve questions provided more coverage and forces you to cover them all. <br /> <br />I found the book difficult to follow in some spots. The authors or editors tried to make the points too fun, contemporary, exiciting, edgy (\\"buff dudes and dudettes of our haiku\\"). Somewhere around the sixth point, I tried to skim through the long examples. I found it difficult to pick out the authors content from their illustrations and jocular comments. Although I found the examples entertaining and informative, they should have been edited down to one paragraph each so the rationale could be more apparent. Having said that, I liked many of the examples and particularly the discussion of Jack Welch and GE. <br /> <br />Their Prediction Maps were very interesting to me and I think the reader would find them most helpful too. I stumbled over them a little at first. The book could have also detailed methods to prepare the observations that go on the Prediction Maps. These Prediction Maps help you identify your high probability predictions and observations that have high impact to your results. <br /> <br />The big benefit of this book is that the methodology they propose fits very well the types of fuzzy decisions faced by businesspeople. The methodology is easy to apply and fairly comprehensive. A favorite expression for this might be \\"go wide, before going deep.\\" <br /> <br />Readers wanting something more quantitative for large financial investments might also try the very readable \\"The Book of Risk\\" by Dan Borge. <br /> <br />After reading this book, you may want to condense this twelve point methodology down to something easy to carry or pin on the wall.  The authors have conveniently provided this for you in their Appendix. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-06-27

Although it has been successfully applied in the medical field by his students. <br /> <br />This is an edgy book that presents the author's strong opinions on how persuasive essays should be written. It might be used as an adjunct textbook in a persuasive writing class as it is not an introductory type of book. The book assumes you have some previous experience in writing persuasive essays. <br /> <br />I particularly liked the following topics: <br /> <br />- The plea to the reader to stay forever curious and to constantly be writing persuasive essays that require researching and deep thinking. His chapter on writing research papers was most helpful. <br />- Great text selections (and references to authors). <br />- His plea to look for disconfirmatory evidence as well as confirmatory ones. Particularly his concept of Infeeling (sync'ing up with the reader). Also how disconfirmatory evidence helps you create his \\"Delta T\\" (changed Thesis) that's finalized in the conclusion. This discussion was new and helpful, but may not work in all types of essays. <br />- The need to argue for something new, not obvious, not taken for granted, or superficial; otherwise, you'll have a boring essay. <br />- Why you must know your audience and how/why to lead your reader's questions. His (borrowed) idea of the reader over your shoulder called the Development Demon tracking the reader's questions. <br />- How to use questions in the early writing stages to help you find a new and exciting Thesis. <br />- His unique concept of starting with a Thesis and then concluding with a changed Thesis (Delta T) after taking into account your proof and the con arguments that don't destroy your Thesis but change it in a modest way. <br />- Some of his idea-creation techniques were interesting.<br />- How to use the concluding sentence on a paragraph. <br />- How to integrate quotations and proof, particularly how not to do it. <br />- His nicely organized list of things not to do when considering style. And the list of things to do to delight the reader. <br />- The importance of surprising the reader. <br />- The importance of metaphors found in great writing. <br /> <br />However, I really took issue with the following: <br /> <br />- When talking about style and paragraph development the author never referenced Joseph Williams on \\"Style\\" yet used what I consider to be William's logic of providing Old information first, then New. And furtermore, Williams does it so much better. Look online here on Amazon for the more recent editions of \\"Style\\" or any of his other books on style by Joseph Williams. <br /> <br />I liked this book very much and highly recommend it for anyone writing essays -- particularly persuasive essays. The book also applies to writers of \\"creative non-fiction.\\"  <br /> <br />Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Keep your dictionary handy as I must have added about 50 new words to my new vocabulary book. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-06-23

The book quickly gives you an overview of the process that she teaches in classes and seminars and then spends a chapter on each topic she considers important to developing your script. <br /> <br />For example, in Chapter 1, the author has you running your story idea against a 16 point checklist to make sure it is a likely to be accepted and produced.  <br /> <br />In Chapter 2, she's giving you hints on how to do your research. Her thoughts on \\"lunch interviews\\" were very interesting. In Chapter 3, she reviews the 3 act structure weaving in examples from the movie Erin Brockvitch. Then in Chapter 4, she has you filling out 3x5 cards for the scenes in your story.  <br /> <br />Although the use of 3x5 scene cards is not new, she proposes some unique ways to develop and go through the cards as you develop your story. After that, in Chapter 5 she provides very clear material involving sub-plots, and how to integrate those with your 3x5 cards.  <br /> <br />Chapter 6 was quite interesting to me and covered the topic of characterization and how to analyze and develop the character's transformation. From this point forward, the book continues on to other important topics - one chapter for each.  Some are: the ticking clock, keeping scenes tight, set-ups in order to prepare your audience for logical and big emotion events (pay-offs). <br /> <br />She provides many references and a great list of videos to watch at home if you are going to analzye the various aspects of screen writing. <br /> <br />The book is aimed at the introduction through the intermediate level. The author works hard to present an orderly process for you to follow in screen writing. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-06-20

Out of the great success of these readings has come the impulse to publish this book, which collects nearly all the short fiction featured to date in the project, \\"Texas Bound.\\" <br /> <br />Each story is a delicious treat that illustrates a different aspect of Texas and its peoples. I say 'peoples' because Texas is quite diverse ethnically and many of its residents are from out of state. Here you'll find license plates that scream \\"Native Born Texan\\" and others that answer back with \\"Not From Texas... But I got here as fast as I could.\\" <br /> <br />There are so many unique and interesting stories to be told about  Texas and this book collects 19 great ones. The short story format makes the reading easy to break up into tasty portions. Each short story is so different that the book becomes more refreshing as you finish each one. <br /> <br />Many of the stories talk about quirky people doing humorous things. The first story, \\"Antlers\\" by Rick Bass, throws a dozen or so deer-hunting men and an obsessed bow-hunter against an attractive female who was dead set against hunting in any form. I laughed my way through this story.  Here's a selection: <br /> <br />\\"Suzie has sandy-red hair, high cold cheeks, and fury-blue eyes; she is short, no taller than anyone's shoulders. But because most of us had known her for so long - and this is what the other men had told me after she'd left them - it was fun, and even stirring, but it wasn't really that great. There wasn't a lot of heat in it for most of them - not the dizzying, lost feeling kind you get sometimes when you meet someone for the first time, or even glimpse them in passing, never to meet... That kind of heat was missing, said most of the men, and it was just comfortable, they said - comfortable.\\" <br /> <br />The ninth story, \\"Good Rocking Tonite\\", by William Hauptman, is a quirky story told by a gynecologist about his brother, an Elvis impersonator. Here's the lead to the story: <br /> <br />\\"The year Elvis died was a strange year, and I remember it not only because of what happened to my brother, Bubba, but because that was the year we had our first transexual here in Nortex.\\" <br /> <br />The story goes on to tell the wild tales of the ner-do-well Elvis impersonator: his travels in small town shows across Texas, his loves with Elvis-groupies, and his disasters that sometimes spilled upon his gynecologist brother. <br /> <br />Most of the short stories are light-hearted.  Not all are acceptable for middle and high school students. That's a shame because each story is such a delight. <br /> <br />Larry McMurtry of Lonesome Dove fame has contributed one of the stories, \\"There Will Be Peace in Korea.\\" <br /> <br />If you are interested in Texas, you'll love the stories. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-06-20

The author, Roberta Jean Bryant, hosts writing seminars and this experience produced this fine how-to book. This book would make a great companion to take on a long airplane flight. It's about 200 pages long. <br /> <br />Anybody Can Write covers many subjects covered by other authors of this how-to-write genre: philosophical, psychological, and practical writing tips. At times it seems to gloss over certain topics without going too deep. But at all times topics are presented with a voice that shows she really cares about you developing your writing skills -- and perhaps the writing habit. <br /> <br />The book is broken up into many small chapters (24) and most end with a set of fun writing exercises. These exercises were well chosen and avoided the crazy ones I've seen in other books. Hers are creative but not stupid. <br /> <br />What I liked most of all was her pulling away the shade cloth on the issue of reading: Reading is (inner-world) passive, writing is (outer-world) active. She shines the light of reality on this  whole issue of taking active action to your writing. Only putting words on paper is active. All else is a passive action. This includes reading, researching, etc. <br /> <br />There were several other areas that I enjoyed and they included: her daily writing habits, her definition of writing, her view of  Escape Writing. <br /> <br />First, her favorite definition of writing is \\"A writer is someone who wrote this morning.\\" I don't believe this is original with the author. Nevertheless it becomes the foundation she uses to construct her writing recommendations. Second, Escape Writing should replace Escape Reading. In Escape Reading you find books that fill your vicarious motivations and let you experience new worlds and perhaps escape from this one. Well, this takes you away from writing.  <br /> <br />Roberta Jean Bryant recommends that you replace this awful escape reading by getting a life and doing Escape Writing. In Escape Writing you would be writing about things that you find enjoyable and not worry about getting it published or any other practical, monetary motivations. This Escape Writing then develops your talents. An example would be writing material for a possible memoir -- that only your family would be interested in. Or, writing letters to imaginary people or writing a dialog between objects (your paper and pen, you left/right brain, etc.). <br /> <br />The large benefits in this Escape Writing are: developing your writing skills, and developing a self-understanding and an honesty in your writing: baring all. <br /> <br />The book covers more of the philosophy and time-management issues of writing. I does not cover the technical details of how to write a novel, short-story, or non-fiction article or book. <br /> <br />The book's topics are easy to read and include exercises to help burn them in to your brain. The book tends to gloss over certain topics too quickly. It's a kind book and has a soft edge -- compared to a Natalie Goldberg book, which are also terrific but for different reasons. A book like Natalie Goldberg's \\"Writing Down the Bones\\" would tell you how to develop great writing habits then tell you all the embarassing details of her personal life (truly interesting). This book just gives you the instructions and the philosophy behind it in a gentle, kind way -- without baring the life of the author. This is not a Mr. Rogers type of book, but a gentle, kind, drill-sergeant Momma that pushes you along the easier path to develop your writing. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-06-16

Like both of these authors, Brandilyn Collins explains how to create well-developed, compelling characters that you can let loose in your stories. <br /> <br />All of the author's techniques tie back to Stansislavsky's \\"Method Acting.\\" Each chapter starts with an analysis of one of techniques of Method Acting. Then that technique is summarized in terms of ficiton writing. The remaining chapter fills in the details and gives examples. <br /> <br />In addition to the techniques of character development, the author presents several narrative frameworks for the overall plotting of the story. She also discusses crafting each scene using character objectives that flow from the character's Inner Values. <br /> <br />The chapter on dialog was interesting. Here, the author shows you how to link the hidden-message of dialog (sub-texting) back to the richly-developed psychological profile, or inner values, of the character. <br /> <br />I liked the book very much - particularly her conceptualization of Method Acting back to narrative writing and her well-explained examples. This book is different than many others describing character development. The author also includes exercises that the reader can pursue. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-05-28

Stories are required to sell to wants. Any product beyond the simplest requires marketing to the customer's wants. Only commodities and simple products can be sold with facts addressing the needs. <br /> <br />Godin explains that prospects have 'worldviews' that reflect their biases, opinions, ways of thinking, etc. The marketer's job is to come up with a 'story' that 'frames' (or hooks) onto the prospect's 'worldview.' 'Frames' are the links into each aspect of the 'worldview.'  These terms are defined by copious examples throughout the book.  <br /> <br />In addition to the many business and product examples, the one example I found most interesting was his 'story' review of the recent Bush vs. Kerry election campaigns. Godin believes that Kerry failed to tell a story that the voters wanted to believe, and also Kerry was inconsistent in his story. Further, it wasn't the candidates ability or lack thereof that lost or won the race, but whether their stories resonated with the pre-existing worldviews (biases, worries, etc.) going on in the heads of the electors.  <br /> <br />This is the same way he looks at new product launches. If the story doesn't resonate with a large enough base of prospects, it won't take off. <br /> <br />Seth Godin goes on to develop many spin-off points using his theme of story, framework, and worldview. He recommends that you find groups of prospects that have a proclivity to talk among themselves, and to only introduce 'wow' products. These other topics also tie back into previous books the author has written. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this book is a great book. It's easy to read, filled with examples, and a logical extension of his previous work. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-05-28

The author has devised these indicators over a long time but only recently (compared to other indicators) has put them together in a working system. His company provides updates to all of these indicators but the author also tells you how to prepare a number of them yourself.     It appears that the getting the data is somewhat difficult and messy. It thus borders more on art than science, as some data series come out late (but they are lagging indicators) and some data is just irregular or estimated.    The author's testing show great results over the exuberant 2000 decline, but I believe the time period of live testing has been too short and the messiness of the indicators themselves augur for more testing.    Please note that it is doubtful that the average investor can accumulate the data to replicate what the authors have proposed. However, there are spin-off indicator ideas that could be applied by the interested market-timer.    Also note that there are many researchers who say that market timing is impossible, and that any research pointing to success just used a small period of time where it worked. They also say that market timers who say their systems have worked over the last 70 years have either fit their data going backward, or are just a statistical anomaly.      However, most market timers say that market timing can increase your odds of success in the market many times (like double or triple your returns if you can avoid the worst 10% or 20% of the market). To apply the research of these authors, you have to believe that market timing actually works, or that you can shave the odds to your favor.    I like this book because it clearly lays out a new indicator methodology along with a rationale. It's up to the reader then to prove that the system works or that he can derive new, easier or better indicators on his own.    John Dunbar  Sugar Land, TX	2005-05-11

Great book & website	I discovered Rob Ryan's web site years ago (before this book or its previous 1st edition) when I was searching for information on startups using a web search engine. There I found a well researched set of slides that would-be entrepreneurs could use when presenting to venture capitalists. He had made them free for anyone to reference online.<br /><br />The concept was that you, the budding entrepreneur who wanted his help, would prepare your presentation to him before you arrived. If he liked your business idea he would help. But he found that too many budding entrepreneurs hadn't thought things through or hadn't taken their new business idea far enough along (like not having any customers and or even a product or its prototype). So this web site with its slides would fulfill this information role, and also fulfill the role of filtering out bad ideas.<br /><br />Previously the author had a back injury and resigned from his CEO role at Ascend. He had started a ranch in Montana to coach engineers, more than others, wanting to get tech start-ups going. He put the slide presentation online using Microsoft Powerpoint. This was quite novel at that time.<br /><br />Over time he developed this book (1st and 2nd edition) which included his recommendation for the ideal slide presentation to prospective investors in startups. It now includes much other discussion on how he developed his philosophy on startups as well as detailed discussions on the startups he's been involved with since opening his ranch in Montana. It's filled with rules, opinions, wisdom and commonly-made mistakes by start-ups. This book is particularly informative on what the entrepreneur needs to do in the early startup stage.<br /><br />The author is biased in the favor of high-technology startups with engineers at its core. His focus is helping these engineers start up a company that requires capital investments from people understanding the technology and from people who demand large results (10 : 1 is a standard expectation for a venture capital deal). This means the big Silicon Valley venture capitalists primarily.<br /><br />The slides from his Entrepreneur America site are annotated with his discussions about how each slide helps the entrepreneur increase his odds of having a successful startup.<br /><br />The big reason to read this book is to absorb the author's unique experience and the author's strong opinions on how to put together a startup having a high probability of success. He is very practical and blunt in his advice. This is not a theoretical book, but a book written by someone who has done it before, who has consulted with others who are doing it now, and someone who cares about start-up entrepreneurs as a group.<br /><br />This should be required reading for all entrepreneurs starting up a high-tech or high-growth business and certainly for all students on entrepreneurial tracks in MBA programs.<br /><br />John Dunbar<br /><br />Sugar Land, TX: 1 is a standard expectation for a venture capital deal).

The author has experience with pre-funded start-ups and their efforts to validate their markets. There are few books that describe this early stage activity for entrepreneurs, where it's difficult to judge a market. Thus, this book is highly recommended. <br /> <br />Pluses <br />- Puts proper weights on crucial start up tasks with an emphasis on the execution team. The author says execution and the execution team is more important than the idea. He makes a good point but I don't think having a good execution team is adequate reason to create a startup. You still need an organizing idea that offers overwhelming advantage. <br />- Recommends that you apply new technology to existing market to ease an existing pain. He particularly likes applying new technologies to business processes (of course Dell is one of the examples here).  <br />- Asks you to repeatedly hypothesize and then prove/disprove the pain of your prospects. The area of customer need has to have a felt pain. The search for pain increases the likelihood of success, and makes marketing easier. <br />- Recommends rigorous upfront market research into prospects and influencers. Talk to at least 100 potential customers. After doing this the author says the business plan is easier to write.  <br />- I liked his comments on talking to affinity groups, trade pubs, user groups, trade shows, and industry influencers. <br />- Get to the market quickly with a product that solves their immediate pain. <br /> <br />Minuses <br />- Relies on quantitative market research for initial phase instead of one-on-one. His defense is that our goal is to be doing market research, not selling our solution. However, I believe the best market research comes from one on one discussions. See Barry Feig's books on market research for more on this, \\"Marketing Straight To the Heart\\" etc.. <br /> <br />Questionable Items <br />- Your idea does nothave to be unique. \\"There is no new idea.\\" To the author, ideas are commodities, it's teams that can execute that are scarce. While I agree, I can't see starting up a company unless you have a competitive advantage that goes beyond our subjective opinion of a start-up crew. <br />- First to market is no big thing, it's an unsustainable advantage. Execute to dominate, not define a space. I generally disagree, but he makes a good point. I also believe in first mover advantage made popular by Geoffrey Moore (\\"Crossing the Chasm\\") and also in Ries's recommendation to create a new niche to dominate (See \\"The Origin of Brands\\" by Al and Laura Ries). But I also believe, like the author suggests, great execution is often a deciding factor. I think he gives these other ideas short shrift because he sees so many companies failing on execution. <br />- Partner, partner, partner. I think the startup should try for a complete product rather than give up large pieces of the solution. But I can see how some situations demand this. <br /> <br />There's a lot more to this book than the few points I listed above. He gives more details on the execution team which were particularly good. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is an excellent book. It should be required reading for all MBA students of entrepreneurial studies as well as anyone in the early stages of a startup who is trying to validate the company's market. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-05-09

That book was very good.  This book is better. <br /> <br />The book is very easy to read. It includes some marketing techniques created by others. But his integration of these techniques into a system was very well done. <br /> <br />Gleeck goes through all the criteria and steps for picking a market or niche. I thought this was very interesting and helpful. The coverage of helpful information that could be applied immediately is very broad. The recommendations are clearly laid out. <br /> <br />He repeats a lot of the seminar material but fortunately the seminar material is a small part of the book. Although I have other books of this type, I liked Gleeck's work very much and recommend it highly. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-05-01

The author summarizes his interviews and research of noted inventors and concludes that there are eleven secrets to their inventions.  These become the chapters in his book: <br /> <br />1) Creating Possibilities, 2) Pinpointing Problems, 3) Recognizing Patterns, 4) Channeling Chance, 5) Transcending Boundaries, 6) Detecting Barriers, 7) Applying Analogies, 8) Visualizing Results, 9) Embracing Failure, 10) Multiplying Insights, 11) Thinking Systematically. <br /> <br />I found these chapters to be the most interesting: Visualizing Results, Applying Analogies and Thinking Systematically. <br /> <br />The book is interesting to read because the author weaves research into invention with interesting interviews with active inventors.  Here's an example on visualization, talking with Stephen Jacobsen, Sarcos Research, who runs an invention firm specializing in robotics: <br /> <br />\\"... he begins painting word pictures in rapid-fire succession that illustrate how his creations work. He is the kind of man who wouldn't seem outof place zipped up in a silver jumpsuit as the scientific captain on a spacestation orbiting the galaxy... Like many of his peers, Jacobsen collects inventions from the past. In his case, especially, these props serve as inspirations for thinking visually... Jacobsen is more interested in perceiving problems and quandaries firsthand - unburdened by the knowledge of prior approaches -- and then visualizing a new idea on his own.\\" <br /> <br />Thus, each chapter develops an important trait of inventors and then illustrates just how that trait is used to invent. He illustrates each chapter with two or three inventors.  There is little repeat in the choice of inventors.  I found all of the interview material most intriguing.  The book ends with a detailed bibliography. But much of the really interesting material came from his interviews with living inventors. <br /> <br />This is a delightful, interesting, important and well-written book. Required for anyone interested in invention and technology. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-04-25

Freewriting, directed exercise	This is an important but slow and ponderous book.  Even though this was not a lively book, the subject matter made it a page-turner for me.  The authors describe which methods have shown quantitative results in helping students learn to write.    The authors have an icy spot in their hearts for Peter Elbow and the free writing methods they criticize so roundly -- perhaps to payback Elbow's criticisms of this author's Sentence Combining methods. (For those who do not know of Peter Elbow... he is the grand advocate of student's doing (usually timed) free writing to discover what they really wanted to say.)    These authors believe Sentence Combining exercises have proved more successful in teaching students to write -- particularly when compared to free writing. Sentence Combining is where you are given maybe ten sets of three (or more) sentences. Your job is to construct one sentence by combining the three sentences into one. When you're done, you'll have ten complicated sentences that make a very long paragraph. The purpose is to get the student to organize his thoughts under time pressure.    I believe they criticize free writing because it is often touted as a solution for everything from writing to thinning hair.  One of their main contentions is that the students need feedback to what they write and this feedback is too time consuming when everyone is writing long essays.  Thus the students don't receive the reputed benefits of timed writing.    After using their recommended regimen, I believe that Sentence Combining can provide ONE of the methods to help students create interesting sentences, to create organized paragraphs, to write in a more sophisticated manner. However, it is not the great technique that they say it is. To me, it appears too simple.    What I particularly liked was their discussion of copying great writing.  They call this \\"Text Reconstruction.\\"  Ben Franklin used a form of this.  So did Somerset Maugham and other notable authors.  Malcolm Xcopied a dictionary while in prison.  There is much to recommend this technique.  Some authors talk about it but only these authors have quoted research to support it quantitatively.    The authors review several other teaching methods and describe the history of writing, English, literature in the college curriculums.  I found that fascinating as well.    This book is not that large but it might prove ponderous to some because of the copious examples, references, and history.  Highly recommended for writing instructors.    I don't see why the methods recommended by these authors can't be used with cult-hero Peter Elbows' free writing. I think Peter Elbow's approach is more important. Perhaps the correct approach would be: 1/2 or more of Peter Elbow's free-writing, and the remaining filled with directed writing exercises (one being Sentence Completions).

All of his books are recommended. <br /> <br />This book, written for college level instruction, might be restricted to an audience with the opportunity to write one essay over multiple class periods, with time for teacher conferences in between.  Still, there are many great tips for the writing teacher of all grade levels.  There are also great writing tips for the author as well. <br /> <br />I think of Murray's books as squeezing Peter Elbow's long-winded philosophy on writing into a condensed and more easily understood form.  This Elbow philosophy proposes that you should write to determine what you really want to say. <br /> <br />The book by Murray is only 264 pages but the density of great ideas and things to do make this book feel longer. <br /> <br />I particularly liked Murray's discussion on getting reactions to writing and what he calls the \\"response theory of teaching\\" in getting the student to react to his own writing. <br /> <br />I keep going back to re-read Murray's recommendations on the writing process.  As in all of Murray's books, he provides a very thorough list of references. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended as it provides many practical exercises with a philosophy that I agree with. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-03-15

The first book was an excellent background on complexity theory and how it applies to business.  This part was excellent.  But the book promised \\"insight\\" and \\"foresight\\" - the abilities to understand and then the ability to predict. <br /> <br />But the book doesn't deliver on the ability to derive insight or predict.  First, the how-to part of the book starts near the end of the book and is presented quickly and without much detail.  Second, other than one page of questions to ask yourself when preparing the author's format of a mind map, there was no magic, few detailed procedures, and little methodology to speak of. <br /> <br />I waited for this great epihany of understanding after the big build up on the history of thinking and complexity theory.  I followed the author through Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and up through recent thinkers and on to New Mexico's complexity wizards.  Then the book shifted down into a simplistic reading style with buzzwords on every page. <br /> <br />I felt that the author may indeed be able to lead groups through her tiny methodology and derive some benefit.  But as a text on how to derive insight or create a forecast the book falls short.  Buy this book for the interesting background on thinking, philosophy, knowledge, and complexity.  Then you'll be happy if the insight/foresight system doesn't delight. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-02-23

I kept turning the pages to find out what would happen next, but I had to slow down to enjoy the detailed description, setting, history, nature, and interesting vocabulary. <br /> <br />Here's a sample quote that I think reflects the quality of the writing: <br /> <br />\\"Ada and Ruby hoed and pulled weeds among the rows of young cabbages and turnips, collards and onions, the kind of coarse food they would mostly live on for the winter. Some weeks earlier they had prepared the garden carefully, plowing and sweetening the dirt with fireplace ashes and manure from the barn and then harrowing the cloddy ground, Ruby driving the horse while Ada rode the drag to add weight.\\" <br /> <br />The author's use of verbs and specific description was an inspiration.  This first time novelist was consistently great.   <br /> <br />Some people may object to the vocabulary of the 1860's that was interspersed through out.  I liked it very much. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-02-21

Unlike many other such authors he clearly describes an order to your writing that prevents wasting time on scenes that will never be used. <br /> <br />In addition to general advice on writing fiction, the author presents a procedure using forms and 3x5 or 5x8 cards. Although this may sound too simplistic and structured, he describes how it actually gives greater freedom if you limit the amount of information on the cards and forms.   <br /> <br />He recommends that writers identify \\"master\\" scenes and characters and he gives these special meaning.  I liked his overall approach.  And, I shared a common like for the fiction authors that Smith uses.

It was a real page-turner and I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />This Brit took on the vacuum sweeper industry worldwide and now is introducing washing machines that may be technologically superior -- just like his sweepers.  He has invented and introduced several products to the world. <br /> <br />Here's what you can get from this book: <br /> <br />1) A humorous story of entrepreneurial struggle and then success, <br />2) Dyson's rules for product design, <br />3) Dyson's rules for start-ups for manufacturing companies, <br />4) Some great words to improve your vocabulary (he's British remember), <br />5) Lessons in patents and the lengths to which you will have to defend them, <br />6) How entrenched product manufacturers will buy companies to squelch a superior technology to keep it off the market, <br />7) How your wayward son who goes off to study art may actually end up richer than you. <br />8) How to protect yourself from unscrupulous competitors (are there any other kind?) <br /> <br />Most important of all are his rules for design and for startups.   <br /> <br />His basic rule for coming up with new products goes like this: <br /> <br />Find a durable consumer product that every household buys. Find out what bugs people about this product.  Use technology to dramatically improve its performance -- preferably find the technology in other industries.  Look for new materials providing superior durability.  Prototype, prototype, prototype.   Test, test, test. Then design outward for style and ergonomics (Form follows function.)  Don't listen to others.  Don't hire consultants.  Market and manufacture it yourself.  You can learn any subject in 6 months (I think that's a little quick but the point is well made).  Keep improving (Japanese style Kaisen) once you have developed your new product (he's developed many improved models once he went into production). <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book and recommend it heartedly.  I wondered though if Dyson wasn't a bit too cantankarous for his own good.  I often wondered why he ended up in so many lawsuits and business deals gone awry.   Were all his competitors ruthless?  Or was he difficult to establish business relationships with?  We will never know, and perhaps it's not that important.  But there's lots to learn by reading this book.  I understand he has another book, self-published, just on the design and invention aspects and I hope to get that book also.  I'll check with the wife to see if we need another sweeper.  He says they really suck.  In fact it sucks up to three times more than competitors.  Well, that's his humor not mine. <br /> <br />This book should be required reading at all business schools. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-01-14

I say Hagstrom's because I think that much of Buffet's allocation methodology remains between Buffet's ears -- and not that of Hagstrom the author.  Also, I believe Buffet is more opportunistic; he acts decisively when opportunities present themselves. <br /> <br />The author adds discussion of technology stocks, an anathema of Buffet's, and the obligatory discussion of complex adaptive networks which might not be Buffet thinking but more along the lines of Charles Munger, his cohort. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, there are many interesting points in this book.  I listened to the audio tapes and they excellent.  I then took the book out from the library and liked the tapes more. <br /> <br />The author covers several important topics, in a summarized way, but also in a very interesting way.  One topic done well was thinking in terms of probabilities.  Another was diversification: don't over-diversify. <br /> <br />The author also quoted from several books outside of the financial area and have become intrigued with them.  They were: Fire in the Mind (Johnson), Full House (Gould), Against the Gods (Bernstein). <br /> <br />I think Hagstrom is a very good author but his works seem to lack the detail that I like to see.  He's one that can pull the strands of many topics together but perhaps skates over their details.  I would have liked more detail on subjective probabilities as applied to the stock market for example.  More on how Bayes, etc. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2005-01-14

Then, the writer must fashion that into something understandable to the reader (\\"staged performance\\"). <br /> <br />They offer questions the writer needs to ask during the writing process, such as: \\"What do I want my readers to know?, What do I want my readers to feel? What do I want my readers to do?\\"  The authors also explain why the questions \\"What?, Why?, Why Not?\\" are so important to inventive problem-solving. <br /> <br />This book details how an essay should be developed mechanically.  Their coverage of developing a Thesis Sentence was most helpful for me.  <br /> <br />Here's their definition of a Thesis Sentence: a rational defense and development of an opinion as precisely worded as possible, or, raising a precise question about something controversial and trying to answer it.  The authors spend a good deal of time discussing the development of a Thesis Sentence and then how to develop the ideas that support it. <br /> <br />I also found their discussion of Introductions very helpful, particularly that we should not be \\"Barging into the Topic\\" nor \\"Bungling into the Topic\\" -- both sections in the book describing common errors in Introductions. <br /> <br />The authors discuss reasoning and do a great job showing the benefits and pitfalls in Inductive vs Deductive reasoning.  After reading the book you'll be most knowledgeable about the differences and the details of how to develop arguments. <br /> <br />The authorsdevote a large proportion of their book to the presentation of your argument to your reader, as opposed to the initial development of your argument. <br /> <br />The final section on Grammar was not needed considering the large selection of books on this subject.  But the extra Appendix on Inductive and Deductive logic was truly great. <br /> <br />Think of this book as a combination of: how to write in general, how to write a reasoned essay, how to think, how to marshal your arguments in the most convincing way for the reader, how to search for truth. <br /> <br />It's not a large book as it was written very concisely.  I highly recommend this book. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2004-12-07

This book is appropriate for individual writers as well as writing instructors.<br /><br />The author provides an extensive bibliography, which has now set me off on a chase for those books he recommended.<br /><br />John Dunbar<br /><br />Sugar Land, TX	2004-08-08
US	53053083	R3H9UGQQ99M7ZB	1893056066	612188606	With Rigor for All: Teaching the Classics to Contemporary Students	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	I hate to pile on, but this is a great book	Carol Jago describes why students should read more, and particularly why they should read the classics.  Carol Jago shows how the classics provide better life-long learning for readers than the usually recommended high school novels, which are quickly forgotten.  The hard-to-read classics have enduring stories; stories that will stay with the readers for their life time. <br /> <br />Although the classics are difficult for students to read and require more of the teacher, the author believes the effort is worthwhile and she presents some techniques to make this reading easier.  But, unfortunately, she fails to provide a magic pill to fight the onslaught of TV, video games and the internet.   <br /> <br />I really liked her reading lists, and the book-to-book pairings of contemporary literature with classics.  She also describes her teaching methods which surmount some of the difficulties in teaching classics to high-schoolers. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone teaching reading, English, or Western Civilization. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2004-08-03

It also presents many thinking exercises you can apply immediately.  Of great importance is the author's descriptions of how the brain tricks itself into making wrong decisions. <br /> <br />The writing is very readable and generally keeps you riveted to the material. However, you must frequently stop and think about the ramifications of what the author is presenting.  Each sentence, paragraph, section, chapter is deeply thought out.  There is great detail and information to consider. <br /> <br />The exercises were useful, although there were a few that were too simplistic. Sometimes the exercises were too repetitive to material just presented in the text (repetition of the same questions, in the same order).  But overall, the exercises were most valuable and I will probably return there on later readings of this book. <br /> <br />There is one reviewer of this book that took issue with the sections discussing how to analyze controversial issues.  I had the same reservations.  After presenting detailed logic on how to think through issues objectively, I thought the authors let their own anarchist biases effect their proposed analyses of  controversial issues, turning these sections into a rhetoric for their political positions.  If they had said that their logic was just one analysis of the issues then that would be OK, but instead they presented their controversial analyses as the correct one.  These really detracted from the power of the material as I thought of many poor assumptions made on their part. <br /> <br />But fortunately, the political rhetoric and controversial issues section of the book was small... at most 2 chapters. <br /> <br />However, there is so much to like about this book.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn a process for critical thinking.  It is so easy for our minds to let non-rational factors determine our decisions.Worse, we often don't realize that our mind is playing tricks on ourselves.  And, this is to our detriment.   <br /> <br />By applying the authors' rules and exercises you can help catch this flawed, mostly ego-centric thinking while its still in the midst of a crime. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX	2004-07-25

The book was laid out very clearly and thus someone unfamiliar with some creativity concepts could follow it.<br />As I read the book I have become fascinated with how the author combined solution methodologies.<br />There's a lot of work in following his long list of things to do and ask, but I think the results will be well worth it.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2004-07-02

US	53053083	RL44LAEFCLAK5	0060570148	231410712	The Origin of Brands: Discover the Natural Laws of Product Innovation and Business Survival	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Their work keeps getting better and better	This latest book by Al Ries and his daughter Laura extends their previous work on positioning, brands, categories, being first in a category, and why publicity is more important now than advertising.<br />The authors draw an extended analogy to Charles Darwin's Origin of Species that runs through out the book.  <br />In the business world Categories like computers evolve slowly through competition but also diverge rapidly through specialization.  Over time those species that have won look quite different (lion vs. a tiger, for example).  The same diverging is true with categories like computers where we now have desktops, laptops, palmtops.<br />The authors draw the parallel that this concept of divergence of the species also applies to categories in business.  Understanding this similarity, they say, is your key to success in business.  You just have to create new categories, and then dominate that category.  But this book develops this positioning logic in ways that seemed much clearer to me than their previous works.<br />To succeed, you (the business owner/manager) must CREATE NEW CATEGORIES (palmtops), and doing this is MORE IMPORTANT than your creation of new brands (Sharp Zaurus).  Creating a brand is more important because you must end up being 1st or 2nd in that category to be successful.  (Sounds like Jack Welch's thinking of 'We're going to be 1, 2 or 3 in an industry, or else we sell that subsidiary.')<br />Through a slow elaboration of proof after proof, chapter after chapter, the Ries authors convince you to see the logic of what they have been advocating for the last 20 or so years on positioning, categories, brands and publicity.  As a reader I found this slow elaboration of proofs to be slow reading, however, I'm sure it's required for the skeptics (advertising account reps, I'm sure).<br />In regards to publicity, they recommend a way to create a new category.  This methodology requires the use of slow build up publicity rather than fast splurge advertising.<br />If you accept their thinking on categories and brands, and I do, then you will be against mergers that take companies into unrelated fields, and you will be against line extensions that weaken your brand.  The chapter on &quot;Pruning&quot; was especially enlightening in this regard.  Toyota's development of Lexus was a great example of how to create a new category.  The company can sell off Lexus and not hurt the Toyota brand.  The authors have other examples of good creation of categories.  But their examples of poorly thought out brands was quite extensive, and sometimes overwhelming.<br />There are three big rewards from reading this book.  First, you will get a deep grounding in why you must create Categories first, then create the first brand in that category.  Second, in reading all the elaboration you will develop a working knowledge of seeing brands and categories, and where companies fit in that category.<br />In this manner when you see that McDonalds is adding DVD rentals (yesterday's WSJ) you will know that this is CONVERGENCE and it is bad.  They should be DIVERGING instead.  Such convergence will dilute their brand of hamburgers, fries, and shakes.  Should we now call them &quot;Blockaburger?&quot;<br />In fact, I found it interesting that the authors described how In And Out hamburgers in California now has higher per store sales than McDonalds and that McDonalds per store sales are static, and perhaps dropping if their figures weren't deflated for inflation.  Again, there's lots of examples and details.<br />And the third reward from reading this book is that the last three chapters of the book provide a methodology (albeit somewhat abstract) for you to follow.  You will learn to DIVERGE NOT CONVERGE, create the Category first, then create a brand to be first in that category.  You will learn that its OK to be second in an industry, if you only... well, you'll have to read the book to get all the other details.<br />This book is highly recommended.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2004-05-25

Unfortunately it didn't attack the text processing problems that I wanted discussed.<br />Also, in the area of Regular Expressions the examples didn't directly use the Python library, instead a wrap around function was used for the many examples and that detracted from using the book as a reference book for this purpose.<br />I found that Python has several different ways to do string processing.  Also, some of those ways come up with conflicting results.  At the time of this writing the authors of Python are re-organizing and improving this area.  <br />What is truly great about the book is the discussion of state machines, parsers, and functional programming.  Although these topics detract from the focus on string processing somewhat this book is perhaps the only popular Python book out there that does these topics justice.  I thought they were very well written.<br />My overall complaint is that this book includes too many things outside of text processing using the core Python language.  But other readers may appreciate this aspect more than I did.  If you want coverage on handling email specifically, the author covers that.  Same with HTML processing and other specialized topics.  I just wanted to low down on using the full string processing capabilities of the core Python language -- not necessarily all the specialized libraries.<br />I found string processing to be messy with Python but found Ruby to be much easier.  That is perhaps because Ruby is a newer language and it has some features of Perl built in.  Ruby however does not have the extent of libraries available like Python, nor does it have as nice of Windows GUI.<br />Overall, if you are looking for a book on text processing this is the only book out there, and a big plus with this book is what you will learn on function programming, state machines and parsers.<br />The author worked hard to produce a book in thisspecialized area.  He has lots of code examples.  Highly recommended for Python programmers.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2004-02-29

I have Ruby version 1.8.1-11.  So the book is missing certain improvements to this elegant object oriented language.  But that didn't seem to be a problem for me when using the book while learning the language.<br />I keep this book by my side when programming Ruby because, like most O'Reilly Cookbooks, the answers to the basics are a quick flip of the pages away.  I also use The Ruby Way which is also good in a text book kind of way -- it offers examples.<br />All the basic functions and Classes are documented in this Cookbook. Its as if the originator of the language, the author Yukihiro Matsumoto, squeezed all the fluff out of the documentation and only served up the critical calling conventions for all important statements, functions and Classes.<br />For updates on the functions you can also use online resources or the Help file that comes with the program itself.<br />This review was written in February of 2004 and version 2.0 of Ruby is said to be a complete re-write.  But that release will not be out for another year or so.  I would then guess that this book would be valid through 2005.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2004-02-29

It's a not-so-well-kept secret among writers that the principle of conflict and resolution, so dear to the novelist's heart, applies just as successfuly to exposition and non-ficton as it does to fiction, even the most theoretical and academic kinds.&quot;  He then goes on to list eleven ways to include conflict in your non-fiction.

I bought the &quot;Style: Ten Lessons&quot; book first and after reading his previous book, I wanted more from this author.  This new book is a fitting treat; it is destined to be a classic in the field of writing.<br />This smaller 150 page book presents many easy-to-apply principles and, for me, were easier to understand.<br />The principles that I liked most were:<br />+ How nominalizations can be very good or very bad, depending on their purpose, or lack of it.<BR>+ How to re-arrange sentences putting the new and most important ideas on the end; thus sometimes flipping the sentence around and making good use of the passive tense.<BR>+ The importance of aligning the characters of your story with the subjects of your sentences, and using active verbs to make &quot;interesting subjects do interesting things.&quot;<BR>+ Why and how to keep the distance between subject, verb and object short.<br />There are many, many other writing principles that you will find very useful.  Although this book is written for someone with writing experience, a beginner will also find it MOST helpful.<br />I recommend any budding writer to buy both books.

It combines the &quot;margin of safety&quot; approach using free cash flow of Graham with the Economic Value Added (EVA) approach of determining returns in excess of its weighted average cost of capital.  The author charts these new Defensive EPS and Enterprising EPS so you can see if they meet a minimum test.<br />The book is easy to read and the techniques are easy to apply.  The author also gives you some extra ratios to help screen out your long term purchase candidates.<br />It's not a deeply academic book but more of a presentation of  practical advice and a proprietary fundamentalist stock selection system that will keep you out of trouble.  The author also discusses how to evaluate management and how to evaluate competitive advantange.  These chapters were also good.<br />There are many interesting examples in the book.

It appears to have graduated from being a collection of coveted class handouts for MBA's to an almost-book.  Its perfectly bound but the fonts are large, uses Power Point graphics, and needs great editing to turn it into a professional book.<br />That aside, you will find information here that you won't find elsewhere.  It is easy to read and the information is easy to apply to your own business, although the book's focus is on evaluating existing (not new) technology companies.  I'm glad the author has made it available.<br />The author assembles critical strategic and financial methodologies and ratios into one book, then shows how they applied to real companies over the last 10 years.  This works quite nicely with two small problems for me.  First, many of the examples were telecommunications companies where a deep understanding of the technologies was needed to understand the context of problem being highlighted.  Secondly, the over-reliance on financial ratios restricts many of the techniques to existing (and not startup) companies.<br />However, I immediately applied two of the techniques to a new software product.  I particularly liked the application of his adjusted Altman's Z Score to finding inflection points.  Many of his techniques could work quite well for evaluating existing IPO's for example.<br />Again, I highly recommend this book.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-11-19

This book presents an easy way to evaluate business start ups.  But unlike &quot;Will It Fly&quot; by McKnight, which I recently reviewed, this book provides a set of criteria that can be applied to nearly all businesses.  The &quot;Will It Fly&quot; book was oriented primarily to venture capital funded start ups.  So, if you are thinking of starting a home-based business all the way on up to a small steel mill, Don's criteria will give you a great first blush look at its feasibility.<br />Like McKnight's book the criteria are just a starting point, because Debelak tells you how to find compensating factors against any weakness in your business model.<br />Although McKnight goes into more depth (44 criteria), I will probably use Debelak's (18 criteria) as a first blush approach as they are easy to apply and remember, they apply for all types of businesses, and they leave out the messy details of how the company will be staffed -- which can be evaluated after these.<br />The author calls his model &quot;GEL&quot;.  &quot;G&quot; is for Great Customers, &quot;E&quot; is for Easy Sales, &quot;L&quot; is for Long Life.<br />Great Customers - Debelak breaks this up into 2 sub areas: Customer Characteristics and Customer Value to the Company.  Customer Characteristics has 3 factors: the number of possible customers (High is better); ease of finding the customers (Easy is better); Spending Patterns of the Customer (Prolific is better).  Likewise, customer Value to the Company is broken into 3 factors.<br />Easy Sales is broken into 2 parts, and in total they total 6 factors).  Long Life (profitability and investments) is likewise broken into 2 parts having a total of 6 factors.<br />You rate each factor into: Excellent, Average, Poor.  Then you want to have a certain number of Excellents... and no more than a certain ratio of Poor's for every so many Excellents.<br />He provides a nice form for you to use to fill all this in.  Healso provides many examples of how to rate different business types.<br />What I found most interesting was his discussion of why we should use his (or McKnight's) business model.  He says that you should go through these criteria before you do your business plan.  You need to re-calibrate your business each year -- because the degree of change is so great.  <br />When you jump into a business plan, you often forget to look at the forest for the trees.  Debelak points out that many dot.com's become dot.bombs because they focused on their plan (and selling it to VC's) and not on whether their business made basic sense.<br />Debelak's criteria make you stay focused on whether your business makes sense.<br />Once you go through Debelak's business model then he describes how you should then proceed doing your business plan.  I like this approach very much.  It allows you to re-configure your &quot;business offer&quot; (so to speak) before locking it in with a business plan.  If your ease of finding new customers is Poor, then you can brainstorm ways to change that.  After that, then you can proceed on your business plan with a modified version of your business, or a compensatory set of tasks to shore up that weakness.<br />The book is 260 pages.  There are copious examples of different businesses being put through the business model and/or business plans.  Sometimes this was a little repetitious.  But, you'll find great nuggets of wisdom and further commentary on his model process in these examples.<br />Overall, this book SHOULD BE REQUIRED for anyone doing a business startup.

The author believes in always adding technology to a need.  I thought his methods of creativity were somewhat simplistic.  But the way he applied them to searching for business solutions was excellent.<br />The most important advice that I received from the book was in hiring.  He suggests that you &quot;Hire Smart At......&quot;.  You'll be surprised with his recommendation.  I had always thought that A. David Silver's advice on start up entrepreneur's was right on (find someone with a hurt), but O'Connors is closer to what I was trying to elucidate but couldn't.<br />Highly recommended, one of my current favorites.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-10-22

How to Know if Your New Business Idea Has Wings...Before You Take the Leap	Books	5	11	12	N	N	This is an excellent and needed book for entrepreneurs	I would give this a 7 on a 5 point scale.  This author presents a list of 44 criteria that you should consider in any new business start up.  Its one of those matrix scoring systems -- which you'd never use to make a critical decision, like choosing your spouse.  So, why would you use it for your business start up?<br />THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT because of the authors extensive experience.  His practicality and experience glows through the simple math weightings.  You see the why and the how of each criteria.  And, you can see that they have been tested on many previous business ideas and start ups.<br />You can use this system to evaluate the likelihood of success of your new venture... or you can use it to tune it up.  I found using the system to evaluate several business ideas at once to be very helpful.<br />I particularly enjoyed the author's reasoning on the weights applied to each of the criteria.<br />THIS IS A REQUIRED BOOK for anyone starting up a new business.

They also point out that a good niche is easily publicized and advertised.<br />To them, a niche is just not a small market.  For example, a niche is not just serving a small community... a niche requires a commonality of needs among the customers.  So, a niche would be selling to the boat owners in a small town, not selling general products to that small town.  Thus, a niche has more easily identifiable customers.<br />The chapters include:<br />1 Niche: What's That?<BR>2 Are You a Good Niche or a Bad Niche?<BR>3 Finding a Good Niche<BR>4 Where there's a trend, there's probably a niche<BR>5 Taking Your Niche Online<BR>6 Six Steps to evaluating a niche<BR>7 Can you find a franchise niche<BR>8 How to proect your business idea<BR>9 Will you ever get noticed<BR>10 Basic steps for opening a niche business<BR>11 Go forth and niche<br />This should be REQUIRED READING FOR STARTUPS.

I underlined a lot of the book and generated many good ideas for new businesses.<br />This is a good practical book for a startup entrepreneur.  I was surprised that I responded to British authors in the business area.  But in fact they had many interesting, yet different, points of view that I found of help.<br />Also, I generally find the motivational area of most books to be too much &quot;rah-rah&quot; fluff.  This book actually had some great practical pointers, as there are lots of checklists in the motivation chapter -- as well as in all chapters of the book.  If you love watching TV, you will have a problem with their chapter on motivation.<br />One topic I found of great interest were their comments on &quot;Buy a Dog&quot; (a business doing poorly).  They say that &quot;If you wish to get rich quickly, then why not think about acquiring a Dog? A Dog may cost you nothing.  In fact, the Dog may cost you less than nothing... It is a popular myth that if you wish to succeed in business you need to come up with a new idea, a new product, a new service.  New products are extremely dangerous...&quot;  They go on to explain their logic.  I found it interesting.<br />As businessmen they have strong opinions and express them well.  And, this makes the book so successful: they relate their experiences along with their viewpoints.<br />Highly recommended for your entrepreneurial reading.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-07-17

To keep the profits rolling in without encroachment from other firms, you must have a competitive advantage: something others do not have.<br />A true competitive advantage is difficult to find and you need to keep that advantage for a long time.  Unfortunately today's competitive advantages come and go quickly. Industry segments come and go in as little as 5 to 8 years.<br />This book, The Ultimate Competitive Advantage, tells you how to find and sustain your firm's competitive advantage over long periods of time.  They observed most firms don't recognize impending changes properly nor do they drop existing ways of doing business (business models) because they have worked well in the past.  Most firms noted as successes in their industry go for the one big revolution and then get forced out.  They are caught flat-footed.<br />This process might look like this:<br />Start:<BR> Significant industry change happens.<BR> Entrenched, successful businesses don't change their business model.<BR> New guys come up with a new business model that better fits the change.<BR> New guys replace old guys because old guys move too little, too late.<BR>Repeat every 7 years.<br />To keep your firm growing and profitable, the authors of this book recommend that you constantly improve or replace your business models.  You should not just improve your existing business model by selling harder or by reducing costs.  Instead you should search for newer models that fit the changes going on in your industry.  You should do more of what's working, but then test new models constantly.  When new models work out, then start implementing them slowly to your business.  This way you won't get caught flat-footed, wondering what to do.  This is the &quot;Ultimate&quot; part of the books title.  It should keep you ticking forever.<br />The book is worth the questions alone.<br />Andy Grove of Intel fame would have you wait until you recognized big changes on the horizon (see his book &quot;Only The Paranoid Survive&quot;). Instead of waiting until change is upon you, the authors of this book want you to be constantly testing new models ahead of time.  As the change is growing, you should be replacing the business models that are no longer working well with newer, better ones.  <br />This is a more pro-active and explicit approach than Grove offered.  Testing offers a &quot;Try before you buy&quot; approach.  As an aside, I found Grove's advice (be constantly paranoid) like saying &quot;Keep your head down when you swing your golf club.&quot;  It is correct, but much like a platitude.<br />If your firm can create customers then you probably have a profitable business model today.  But because your industry can change dramatically, you must have a way to quickly adapt to a new successful model.  You should read this important book so you can learn how to do this.<br />I liked their overall thinking, the specific list of things to do, the list of questions to consider for my business at the end of each chapter, and their well-researched examples.<br />As the authors ask: \\"When was the last time you changed your business model?  What were the last three business models before the current one?\\"  So many embarrassing questions, so little time.<br />If you are interested in competitive advantage, you definitely should read this book.  I have heavily underlined my book and made many annotations in the margins.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-07-15
US	53053083	RIJCU8M094BU2	0449213358	241253921	Hawaii	Books	5	12	14	N	Y	spellbinding, great details and background of hawaii	I really enjoyed this 40+ year old book (classic?) by James Mitchener.  I was spellbound and kept turning those pages late into the nights.<br />I thought his discussion of the Chinese Hakka woman, the queen mother of the successful Chinese on the islands, to be very interesting and representative of that ethnic group.  However, I did have a problem with this woman, particularly at 90+ years old, going through the intricacies of tax loss carry-forwards.  The internal and external dialogue was a little out of character.<br />But Mitchener is one of the great masters.  I highly recommend this book if your going to Hawaii, if you just want an adventure story, or if you want to read about how different ethnic groups learned to muddle along together.  There's a ton of supporting detail that is quite interesting to read, and the book felt that there was nothing extraneous.  The pace was very quick and the characters interesting.  It was easy to visualize the story as it unfolded.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-07-15
US	53053083	R3D2U83KD3W6F4	1560524367	9770460	Inventing Small Products (Crisp Management Library)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Lots of practical advice from someone who's done it	I agree with much of what the other reviews have said so far: on the plusses and minuses. <br />But watch out, it contains some real important advice not found in other books.  This was particularly true in the area of finding the areas and products that need to be improved first, not inventing for your own ego and the creative process he uses for inventing.<br />The author teaches entrepreneurship and has a company that invents new products.  He's been at it for quite some time and has a string of successes.  So, he's qualified to speak.<br />His book is organized in thirds.  First, there is the overall introduction and summary of his process.  This was excellent.  Then he goes through a series of his inventions and uses them to illustrate the various ways that products can be invented.  This was great too, but a fair number, maybe a third, of the examples didn't seem to prove a point.  Also, this is where other reviewers fell out of interest with the book and claimed the author was tooting his horn.  I didn't get that feeling, but did feel that some of the stories didn't add value to the book.<br />Third, there is some really great information on creativity that he summarized from his classes and there is some great biases of his that he presents as practical advice.  The creativity information was a little cryptic.  But if you have read other invention books, the information really came to life.<br />For example, here's a partial quote that I underlined:<br />&quot;In creative problem solving, begin by assessing the problem before labeling it.  Use a system - a series of proven steps.  Here's a five-step system: 1) Assess the situation.  Ask questions.  Ask them endlessly.  Answers will sugest new questions.  Be intelligently ignorant.  Gather facts relentlessly.  But consider 'facts' opinions, until rigorously tested.  Search for the key factor.  In almost every situation one particular fact will turn out to be more important than any other... 2),&quot; etc.<br/>Notice that he lays out 5 steps for you to follow; I only quoted one of them.  These are not the only five.  He has lots of steps, some of them on the same subject... but following different paths.  Also notice that some of the information appear as platitudes (&quot;Be intelligently ignorant.&quot;), but these often summarize previously material in the book.  And finally, considering facts to be opinions is an important point that I did not properly recognize.  <br />On this he also said: &quot;What 'everybody knows to be true' probably isn't.&quot;  This led me to ponder that maybe I should search for what is falsely held to be true about a product area, and try to develop products/services resulting from it.  As an example, Compaq falsely held that selling through retail stores was better than selling direct through the phone and internet.  Dell proved them wrong.  At Compaq this was an opinion parading as a fact and it was sitting there for over 2 years, waiting for someone to exploit it.<br />As a Connecticutt Yankee inventor, the author is parsimonious with his words.  He has taken a vacuum sweeper to his writings taking out all extraneous words and sentences.  I found this format to be quite acceptable.  But this small book (93 pages) should be used as an important adjunct to another more complete book.<br />But his strategy is probably better than most and so is more valuable than a lot of detailed wrong-headed, or theoretical, books.  You get enough information to go and do it.  His plan is not a repetition of others.  He has a unique approach to it.<br />The author is a practical inventor in that he works from lots of drawings, builds lots of prototypes, and most importantly, he focuses only on products that people want and that companies want (or currently do) manufacture.  You will get a step by step plan on how to work backwards from the market.  I think this is most important.<br />One negative: there is a little bit of repetition in this small book,and this detracted a little.<br />But overall, this book is packed with useable, practical, important and valuable information.  My book is heavily underlined.  This small book makes a great book to take on a 2 hour airplane trip.  Then you should implement his suggestions and review the book periodically.<br />Highly recommended.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-07-09

Its development is a big story in Texas.  Its owner, Richard King, migrated to Texas before the Civil War.  The ranch was so big, it could swallow up those little states up North with no sweat.  Today, the ranch is much bigger as it is international in scope.<br />There are several books on the King ranch.  Some were sponsored by the owners.  This is an independant and recent book by an important Texas author.<br />I found the first 2/3's of the book to be really intriguing and well written.  Somewhere about 1/2 way I felt the beginnings of the drumbeat on the Chapman lawsuit against the King ranch.  The last part of the book details the lawsuit as it updates the ranches history to modern times.  In doing so the book loses its riveting advenuresome focus.<br />The author did his best in describing the early South Texas conditions and the development of this great Texas accomplishment.  I really liked the descriptions of the raids by the Texas Rangers among others.<br />A Mr. Chapman was an early partner with Richard King on one of the main pieces of this huge ranch.  The issue was rooted in a verbal partnership contract on land ownership.  Chapman moves away, appears to forget about the property, then dies.  The heirs, various decades later, sue for a hunk of the now successful ranch.  You would think they would have played a more active role in a huge piece of property... like paying property taxes, approving invoices, etc.<br />I kept waiting for the author to side with the Chapman's on the lawsuit but that didn't happen.  But somehow I just felt a prejudice underneath the surface that the author sided with Chapman.  But in the end, the author tried to present both sides of the story.  Although King and the Kleburgs are exonerated, the lawsuit left stains on their character after all the accusations.<br />I think the author didn't know how to present this lawsuit information.  So he just dumped the information into the story trying to be as objective as he could... to let the reader decide which side had the better claim.  It seemed that there was nothing but lawyers and mad people during the last 1/3 of the book.  But in reality much of the growth of the King ranch occurs in the last 1/3 of the book -- particularly the acquisition of larger ranches overseas.<br />I would have given the book a 5 star if this lawsuit issue would have been toned down.  I have no specific recommendations as to how anyone could do any better than what was presented.  It was a history book and this aspect of the ranch needs to be told.<br />Richard King appears as a colorful, feisty Irishman who helps tame wild, hot, inhospitable South Texas.  He weathers great set backs, fights the Mexicans stealing his cattle, rebuilds his torched home (33,000 sq. ft. now), sells his agricultural products by running the Yankee blockades during the Civil War, receives forgiveness from the Yankees after the Civil War, builds a great cattle ranch using Texas Longhorns.  His heirs, the Kleburgs particularly, carry the ranch to new highs, including overseas.  The ranch now is run professionally for the benefit of the heirs and other stockholders.<br />If you have not read any Texas history, you will like this book  What I found striking were the problems that existed back in the 1800's are still with us today.  I also was amazed how many pies Richard King had his finger into.  He loved to form partnerships.  <br />I give the book 4 stars for the great first part of the book.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX<BR>(Upper Gulf Coast, Texas)	2003-07-03

I'm now a fan of his writing.  In this book he's done a great job of describing what it is like to hike the Appalachian Trail.  He describes the detail behind the trail, the problems he had to overcome, and the pleasures of hiking this trail.  It will (or has) become a classic.<br />This book is highly recommended.  I'm now going to buy his &quot;Short History of Everything.&quot;  A young friend of ours (high school age) is reading that book now and really recommends it.<br />I think what I like about Bryson's style is his humor.  Every page forces me to smile, and every a couple of pages he has something that forces out a loud chuckle.  He provides lots of background material (about the trail) and also gives you a history lesson (previous walkers).<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-06-29

Particularly better was the coverage on what makes a durable competitive advantage.  Also, the formulas and approach was organized better.<br />By reading the negative reviews of this book and its original you will find that this is a book written to be easily read.  The authors did a great job of cleaning up the the \\"I knew Warren\\" tone of the first book.<br />The only drawback of this book is its over-simplifying the complications that can occur when you do a value approach - particularly when you look at real data.  Still, this new book gives many examples to walk the reader through the methodology.<br />There is no statistical results shown that this method does indeed beat the market.  You have to take it on faith that this methodology is used by Buffet, that it is what produced his great success, and that it can be duplicated in today's market.<br />Still, this is a great book, and I recommend it to investors, and to businessmen who need to understand more about \\"durable competitive advantage\\" and the kinds of businesses they should be creating.  There is much more that needs to be said about competitive advantage.  There are several books on this (starting with Michael Porter).  This book gives a simplified version.<br />I think it is important to know that Buffet is not a Jack Welch type of manager.  I would say he is closer to a Harold Geneen in that he is more of a \\"rentier\\" than a get-in-the-trenches manager/leader like Welch.  This effects his choice of businesses.  His approach is to own the only gravel pit in the county, and milk it for many years.  This is certainly a good approach, but one that is difficult to pull off because a competitive advantage is difficult to hold on to.<br />It appears that significant monies were made by Buffet using investments not following this method (hedging, speculating on interest rates).  These have provided buffers against when the value investing techniques didn't work.<br />Perhaps most important in the author's and Buffet's approach is the use of stock selection criteria that are outside of the radar of the average investor.  And, that criteria is the screening on \\"durable comepetive advantage.\\"  Few investors screen stocks on this qualitative data.  If this criteria indeed selects successful companies then you will do better than those without this information (assuming you buy right).  <br />After reading this book, you can find out more on competitive advantage and stock prices by reading the books by A. David Silver (Quantum Companies).  He is one of my favorite authors on durable competitive advantage.  You should also read some of the recent books on how to research companies, like the one by Hoover.<br />There are many books on value investing.  There is even a \\"Dummies\\" book on it.  All of these are recommended because you will find that there can be a lot more to it than presented in this book.  I would think that some kind of value investing test should be a requirement for all CEO's.  Hopefully such a focus would keep certain CEO's and their partners-in-crime (CFO's) from focusing on hyping up the stock price through fraud, and get back to producing real business results.  This book does not tell you how to detect puffed up earnings and fraudulent balance sheets.  You'll need to read other value investing books for this.<br />Overall, I believe that if you follow the simple formulas in this book, you will find good value stocks.  Buy this book, rather than the other previous ones.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-04-01

Actually, you could use it on a lot of other types of projects, but software is its best use.<br />What's unique is that it wraps around the \\"Design it first\\" school that I follow, as well as the Extreme Programming (XP)  school that follows a proto-typing approach.<br />SCRUM provides the mechanisms for organizing and controlling the development of your software project.  You develop a short list of deliverables for the next 30 days and have a series of daily meetings.  Oh, there's more to it than this.<br />In software projects I have followed a process where the design is fully thought out in advance.  I say it is 85 % accurate as I know that mid-course corrections will be made as the software is developed and delivered to the client.<br />On large projects we typically work in 2 week deliverables, the author suggests 30 day \\"sprints\\".  We break all the projects up into many packages of deliverables.  One advantage to this was the client could see progress, give on course corrections, and you'd be sure to get paid.  On small projects we have not followed any formal procedures.<br />What SCRUM does is give me a better, more thought out process for what the author calls these 30 day \\"sprints.\\"  I wish I had read this book earlier.<br />I picked up the book at a computer store and bought it reluctantly.  I had heard good things about SCRUM, but the book looked too small and a quick read at the store didn't really turn me on that much.<br />But after I sat down to read it at home, I was very pleased.  It is a very well-underlined book now.<br />I agree with the XP folks on the productivity of 2 person programming teams and have found their \\"test first\\" approach to be very interesting.  However, I do find that their design-on-the-fly approach to be flawed.  When XP works, I think it is because it attracts good programmers... it's not the XP proto-typing approach itself.  In fact, I think any methodology that relies on proto-typing wears out the goodwill of the client.  The clients time is limited and they value it highly.<br />I will say that I found many interesting ideas in XP.  And, I recommend that anyone interested in the subjec of this book, go to the XP websites and read their books (about 6 or so at this time).<br />SCRUM fits around XP just as well as the design-it-first approach.  What I disagree with in SCRUM (and XP) is the use of open office areas for programming.  I believe studies have actually been done on this and closed offices, no windows, white walls, lots of marker boards... wins out.  Anything beyond trivial programming requires concentration.  Noise and movement kills concentration.<br />The graphics in the book really suck, as they look like they were printed out in some kind of old 320x200 screen resolution.  But there is great depth to this book.  It's a smaller sized book with small type (but still easy-to-read).  So you actually get a lot of meat.<br />In the future, I will refer to this great book often and recommend all software people read it.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-04-01

I recommend that they boil down the material and rewrite the book thinking of it as an instruction book from them to some MBA/Engineer (Hewlitt/Packard) who's working out of his garage on some new product.  They should not see this as a college text, or some book that's a supplementary reading for college.  They have great material and great ideas, but it needs focused.  They can completely drop Chapter 6 on Teams.  Their Chapter 7 on Understanding User Needs seemed weak.  They should drop the case studies in Chapters 8 and 9 and integrate that great material into the core text -- otherwise it's just too repetitive.<br />There was an excellent article about the authors in Fast Company magazine, July 2002. page 123.  &quot;How to Design the Perfect Product&quot;.  I recommend reading that article as well.<br />These smart guys from Carnegie Mellon's design school have a unique approach to &quot;Value is all about fulfilling fantasy&quot; and their methodology for getting that into your product.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-03-04

I normally don't like books like this, but...<br />this one by a noted customer service guru seemed to please me.<br />This is one of those books you buy to read on a one hour airplane trip.  It's an easy-to-read, fictional story about customer service.  Kinda hokey, cute.  But it wasn't too cute as this genre often can be.<br />The book is organized around 7 major customer service concepts.  But you'll end up with maybe 20 thoughts that trigger ideas.  Many of them will be stupidly simple, but most businesses don't do them.  Several of them will be embarassing.  Several will be important.<br />There was one point that I thought was particularly important: Your competition is whoever your customer would compare you to... whoever raises your customer's expectations.  So that means FedEx on fast delivery reliability, or in other areas: L.L. Bean, or GE's answer center.  So, don't benchmark your industry competition, benchmark the best in each area of your services.<br />Again, its a cute book but not too cute.  It's fun to read, easily consumed in a one hour flight.  You'll end up with a few good ideas.  It's a great way to keep reminded on customer service topics.  I enjoyed finding out more about Disney.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-02-25

But for most people this book will be too difficult.  If you would file a book titled &quot;Theory Construction&quot; under Architecture, you would have difficulty with this book.<br />The author discusses Concept Mapping (Entity Relationship diagrams for computer people) and Vee Diagrams, a template for structuring knowledge on specific concepts.  <br />He shows how these two tools can improve learning in students.  His examples start with a science class that uses a laboratory to teach practical skills and scientific method learning to students.  For these students, the two tools become important for structuring knowledge and directing future research.<br />His results show that students need to make learning relevant to their existing knowledge and these tools will help do that.  His results show an initial drop off in standardized testing after applying these tools, but then the scores pick back up and exceed standard rote-learning.  I would agree with this -- if you're talking about the upper 20 % of the students.  But I can't see the class laggards buying into these tools, as they require the student to be in love with their subject.  These tools show you how to go deeper and how to find new knowledge.<br />I would recommend these tools for advanced classes and motivated students.  I agree with the author that they will help researchers push back the envelopes of knowledge on their fields of specialization.<br />The Vee tool forces a template of things to &quot;Think&quot; and &quot;Do&quot; when you are formulating questions on a topic.  Although perhaps tedious for some, it appears to work very well.  I liked it very much.  Students in a science lab can use these templates to decide what questions to research, what tests need to be run, how to know if they are successful, etc.<br />It is in this scientific area where the big payoff for these Vee charts are.  I doubt that John Q. Public isgoing to find them as a useful tool on everyday learning decisions.  For this reason I recommend this book for any type of researcher.  The author describes how these Vee Charts have been used successfully by graduate students on their theses.<br />But John Q. Public can easily apply the Concept Maps.  And, the author uses these maps as a tool to interview and assess students.  The author also uses them to help develop books, articles and learning materials.<br />This book would be excellent for someone who has read Kuhn (scientfic revolutions) and wants to find some tools and methodologies for extending knowledge in his field.<br />I think the author is correct in most of his work.  This book is particularly recommended for graduate students doing any kind of research papers.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-02-25

He shows how asking the right question(s) in the right place lead you to innovative solutions.<br />He describes how we think unconsciously using scripts.  It is only when this script fails do we consciously start to think.  He calls this an anomaly.  It is by asking questions and using &quot;remindings&quot; as inputs to questions that we can develop creative solutions to these anomalies.  Anomalies + Explanations = Creative Thought.<br />The author has thought very deeply on the creative process.  You must read it several times to fully apply his techniques.  He gives you plenty of lists and questions to use as suggestions.  He tells you how to form questions, and how to tweak them.<br />This is one of the best books on creative thinking that I've read.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-01-03

And, most would certainly agree.  But using that criteria perhaps only 0.1 % of the business books would be comparable to Drucker, the sage of business management.  Drucker's book might be a 8 or 9 on a 5 point scale (i.e. home run out of the ball park), while this one is one of the top 20 business books for the year it was published - what I would call a solid 5 star ranking.<br />Although he offers lots of great advice, I found his questions the most useful - particularly in the product innovation area.  He covers many of the newer concepts on innovation by other authors, and integrates them into a nice package.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-01-03

It reviews how the art, practical and design type courses were taken out of the engineering schools in the 1950's and how those schools are now correcting the situation.<br />The author reviews the importance of practical experience and the ability to sketch... particularly for chief engineers.<br />Most impressive and perhaps most important was the panoramic history of engineering, design and creativity.  The book has beautiful pictures and an extensive bibliography.<br />I found interesting that Leonardo's notebooks were only part of the many notebooks prepared during the Renaissance.  And, that many of them copied drawings of earlier works.  Lots of pictures of these notebooks are included, along with pictures of the extensive use of models (mostly fortifications) used at this time... and all the way up to WWII.<br />The author discusses how CAD systems really help on the productivity but include so many limiting asssumptions that they may stifle creativity.  Particularly bad from the author's point of view is the over reliance on math.  He points out that most engineering problems are messy, and not amenable to a clean mathematical solution.  And, that we have all these younger engineers looking only for clean problems so they can put their math training to work.  Unfortunately, nature is not so co-operative.<br />His solution: more drawing and more practical experience. For example, budding engineers should get out into the field and go see the problem, or visit other plants.  They should build prototypes and learn how to operate a lathe.  In this regard he likes Dutch and German engineering schools best.<br />This is a great book that any engineer should add to his permanent collection.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2003-01-01

You will learn how humans react to a product - particularly great ones.  I appreciate that the author has given me a new way to look at products and the effect of their designs.<br />The author describes from a neurological and pyschological point of view how you react to a new product the instant you see it.  I am talking micro-seconds here.  Then, he discusses how you come to like it or reject it (a few microseconds later).  This was truly interesting.  He relates it back to Information Theory -- yet the book was not about bits and bytes.  He describes how various shapes communicate differing amounts of information.  Too much results in an over load.<br />The author presents a simple model to analyze products.  To help with this he discusses how he uses semantic difference surveys.  I found this material very interesting although I wish that he had included samples of the survey documents.  I didn't understand how the prospects visualized and then specified the ideal product to compare your product to.<br />This is truly a great book but it does requires you to slow down when you read.  The author carefully defines his terms - which unfortunately have to deal with cultural abstractions (like 'zeitgeists', 'daimons').  To keep up with the author, you need to understand these terms, as the author defines them.<br />I will now go back a second time and try to make his framework more permanent in my brain.<br />The author sleeps and dreams about great design.  He has been a great designer (cars) for some time and now teaches out in San Jose.<br />If you develop new products, or are a CEO of a company, or if you just like design... this is a required book.<br />I looked at the book at the book store several times and put it back because the abstract terminology turned me off.  Later I went and sat down in the book store and read it more slowly.  It was then that I realized what a jewell this book is.  I'd love to sit in on one of his classes.<br />John Dunbar<BR>SugarLand, TX	2003-01-01

The book is easy and enjoyable to read.<br />I underlined this book considerably.  Although I doubt this book contains all the wisdom of the Sage of Omaha, it is reasonably complete.  For that I recommend that you buy and read this book on value investing.<br />The methodology of Buffet-style value investing is easy to do, but the odds are against our patience in waiting for the right buy price.  The itch for action to trade is often overwhelming.  I guess that is why Warren Buffet has proved that, for him, it is indeed an inefficient market.  Some must lose so that he can win.  :)<br />John Dunbar<br />Sugar Land, TX	2002-12-10

The other books describe how you can craft a competitive advantage, what he calls &quot;quantum companies.&quot;  This book describes what is required to become an entrepreneur.<br />This book is unique in its insight into the life and background of an entrepreneur.  In addition it provides a very clear description of the start up of a new company.  <br />A. David Silver is a venture capitalist and has a long experience with entrepreneurs.<br />Unfortunately this is a 1980's book and it may be difficult to find.  After just finding this book I wished I had read it earlier, perhaps with another of his great books on competitive advantage.<br />This book is one of those that should be rated an 8 on a scale of 1 to 5.  If you're an entrepreneur, or want to be, you definitely owe it to yourself (and your spouse) to get this book.  You may be surprised.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-12-10

What I found was a very interesting, tragic, yet successful character in Colonel John Boyd. Besides being a colorful character, he developed military tactics and strategies that profoundly effected the Air Force and the Marines directly.  He started by defining what was required for a successful fighter jet.  Then he had to fight the bureaucracy and bomber-pilot generals.  Along the way he developed an overall military strategy.<br />What was very interesting to me was the illustration of the in-fighting that goes on in the Air Force (and all services) over the development of new aircraft (weapons).  The discussion of the development of the F-15 and the B-1 bomber were most illuminating.  Boyd was instrumental in the development of the F-16 fighter jet.<br />Although this book is not devoted to OODA Loops, the author does cover it in more detail than I understood when I bought it.  The author provides the complete text of one of Boyd's important papers in the back of the book.  This was great.<br />I highly recommend this book if you are interested in military strategy, OODA Loops, Colonel John Boyd, defense procurement, and fighter jets... but because of the heavy swearing by the characters don't loan it to your wife.  The story was exciting and easy to read.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-11-30

This book explains the strategies you should use to identify birds.  When you go out birding you will often (nearly always?) not see the bird clearly, or long enough to make a perfect call.  This book addresses that problem.  I have never seen it addressed so well. <br />All of the three recent Sibley books are just first rate.  I recommend starting with this one on identification, then getting his general guide one, then the one that talks about their behavior.  I really liked the behavior one also.  Its great to research out a bird that you are watching to find out more about how they act.<br />The illustrations in all of his books are first rate.  I have a lot of bird books and found that Sibley's are the best of those I bought.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-11-04

The author leads you through the various ways and reasons to edit your work.<br />As I read the first chapter, I wished for a more compact version of these points, sort of a Cliff Notes approach.  But Mr. Murray's expanded approach was certainly more enjoyable and personal.<br />Although the book is perhaps targeted to a more experienced writer, I underlined many points that I will refer to for help. A beginner might be over-whelmed with all the great techniques on revision, but just the first two chapters alone will yield a dramatic pay-back for his efforts.<br />The book is interspersed with interviews with other authors and their responses to the author's questions also provide useful information, and add credibility to his points.<br />&quot;The Craft of Revision&quot; captures the subject of the book.  You'll learn more about revising your copy than you probably can use for a long time.<br />I highly recommend this book.<br />John Dunbar<br />Sugar Land, TX	2002-10-14

He encourages you to organize groups of like-minded authors to review each other's writing.  There is a very specific protocol for this... and its easy to screw up, so you really need to get the book to find out the details.<br />Without such feedback you will not be able to understand what the reader is thinking as he reads your work.  Elbow is not describing how to get &quot;feedback&quot; but how to understand the effect your writing has on the reader.  In these meetings each individual describes what was going on in his head, what he remembers... not whether he liked your work.  Thus, you see the effect.<br />All three of my Peter Elbow's books have been extremely helpful.  My only complaint is that his writing is too wordy.  However, his wordiness is pleasant to endure.  This book is easily worth a 5 out of 5.<br />John Dunbar<br />Sugar Land, TX	2002-09-12

But the author could be ponderous in repeating some sub-themes and points.<br />You will learn a lot about the causes of genius and creativity but you won't walk away with a quick set of techniques to help you on your immediate problem.  You will learn an overall approach of what has worked in the past.<br />His references and analogies to Darwin make the book even better.  His references of other readings are also excellent and very detailed.  <br />I really liked his comparison of artistic vs. scientific creativity or genius.  One selection from the book that I found very interesting was this one on what makes for greatness in a genius: <br />&quot;... individual differences in total lifetime output are indeed associated with the degree of eminence achieved.  In fact, research has consistently shown that the most powerful single predictor of reputation among both contemporaries and future generations is the person's sum total of contributions.  Furthermore, almost all other variables that may correlate with the differnce in fame between individuals do so only because they affect the output of creative products.&quot;  <br />The point made in this sub-theme by Simonton was that it was the QUANTITY rather than the just the QUALITY that often was the leading indicator of peer acceptance of genius.  If the genius is not stepping up to the plate and taking a lot of swings, he won't go down as a &quot;Babe Ruth.&quot;  Most of the geniuses studied were single home-runners.<br />Another thing I liked about the author was an often used approach of revealing a concept, proving it with lots of historical details and studies, then when you were really convinced, he showed you why other studies show why that logic might be flawed.  He did this several times in the book, and it was quitestimulating to see the flaws in many people's logic... after you had made the same fatal assumption or mistake.<br />I highly recommend this book for those interested in the background and causes of genius and creativity.  My copy of this book is heavily underlined.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-08-24

It makes very interesting reading because this cognitive research approach can control variables and determine what are the actual causal factors that lead to creating great ideas or products.<br />It easy to read and contains lots of good footnotes and discussion about what makes a practical good idea.  I would have given the book a 5 if it had organized and discussed the techniques more.  I had to work hard to pull out and organize their main recommended techniques.  However, I'm glad I bought the book.<br />This book is recommended for those who want a background on creativity from researchers... and that is somewhat easy to read.  If you are looking for a list of creativity techniques to immediately apply, you might find this book to be interesting but not enough of a cookbook... although they do offer some great ideas.

The author lists many non-conventional treatments and how they can help you in caring for your teeth.<br />There are many topics covered by this book besides the debate regarding mercury (&quot;amalgam&quot; fillings).<br />I saw that one reviewer here disliked the use of &quot;EAV&quot; (Electro-dermal Screening).  I would like to provide a more detailed look at this technology.  I have not seen EAV used in the dental practice, but have friends who have tried it, and I have personally seen it used (several times) to detect hidden medical problems in a non-dental area. I have had done to myself (non-dental). <br />Here's my take on this situation: 1) a good dentist can clearly see the major problems in your mouth and you really don't need the EAV screening in most standard cases, 2) it's value comes when the dentist can't see things visually, or doesn't see them with x-rays, 3) it must be used by a skilled practioner and this means they should know accu-puncture as well as conventional medical diagnostic techniques (being a conventional MD is a real plus), 4) the big criticism on EAV should be that it can tell WHERE the problem is, but not WHAT the problem is.<br />Overall, its a device for finding things... in the hands of a skilled practioner.  Unfortunately, many dentists who want to go non-conventional may think that simply buying and using this equipment will make them a better dentist, or let them charge more.

The author starts with the management sage of our time: &quot;Problem Solving Gets You No Where&quot;... Peter Drucker.  Then he moves on to explain why dramatic transformational change is so important.<br />What I really liked about the book was:<br />+ the author's tips on using metaphores in creativity,<BR>+ the discussion how most management fads are just focusing on problem solving and not transformational change.<BR>+ the use of humor in business (this was VERY GOOD).<BR>+ how to analyze conversations.<br />On the negative side, the book appeared a little on the breezy side.

It's huge, well illustrated, and easy to read.  On the negative side, it's too huge to read on an airplane, it's ponderous in reading, it makes my left wrist hurt from holding it up when I read.<br />But overall I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to read how cellular automata can apply to fields showing complexity not solved with tradional mathematical approaches (just about all).<br />I'm appalled by some of the negative reviews of this book here on Amazon.  I think alot of these ad hominem attacks are due to the author's over hyping the book before releasing it, and his general ego-centric personality.  But, the reviews should be on the book, not the author's personality.<br />I found the book to be very easy to read.  Those that say he needed an editor probably did not read the book... particularly the beginning where he describes why he took an informal approach to his writing.<br />Those that claim he grabs credit for Cellular Automata also missed this beginning where he credits those who came before him.  Now, I will admit that Wolfram doesn't hesitate to overuse the \\"I\\" word, but again... he tells you upfront why he does so.  I found it to be only mildly irritating.  Scientists are often egotistical, heck... look at Linus Pauling.<br />In this regard I think we could say that Wolfram is egotistical, but in no way showing hubris.  I think this is a monumental book, and may defy categorization.<br />The purpose of this book was to show how Cellular Automata are at the base of many things complex and currently beyond description or understanding.  To do this he describes Cellular Automata in enough detail so that everyone can understand it, and the experts could not say that something was missed.  This is why the book is ponderously slow.  I found myself jumping ahead to read his conclusions and theories.<br />I will concur with some other reviewers that it is more computation than theory.  I wish the book had been reduced down to 1/3 of the size and more theory and consequences given.  However, that would probably defeat Wolfram's long term goals with the book.  Again, he describes why he structures the book the way he did in the first part of the book.<br />I'm very pleased with my purchase of this book and recommend it to others that have an interest in mathematics.  I particularly liked his discussion of biology and Cellular Automata, and I agree with him that it may offer a better explanatory model than natural selection in evolution.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-06-16

I would consider it a derivative of the TRIZ process started by a Russian engineer, Altshuller.  In effect, this book summarizes up several of the techniques proposed by Altshuller, and later by others.  The authors present these systematic techniques in a very understandable format... something that Altshuller and others have often failed to do.<br />The authors also demonstrate that you can get better results by looking inward to the product itself, rather than listening outward to the customer (&quot;the voice of the customer&quot;).  The Sony Walkman is probably the best example of that.  I was skeptical of this sweeping generalization, but the authors provide lots of research to back up their statements.<br />The book thus presents 4 methods (called &quot;Templates&quot;) to generate ideas for an existing product.  Let me give you an example by using an illustration from the book using perhaps the simplest method: the Displacement Template.  Here you first diagram all the components of a chair (for example).  It is composed of the Back, the Seat, the Legs, and Person sitting on it.  You then remove one of the important components (the Legs).  You are now faced with a product that just has the Back and the Seat.  You now try to derive a marketable product from this idea.  This is called &quot;solution spotting&quot;, when you identify the form of the product first, and then search for a need for this product.  In this example, the new product without legs, could be sold as a beach chair.<br />Although this simplistic example may seem trivial it illustrates the concept that the product came from WITHIN the product itself and not from the market.  It also can be seen to be systematic... in that you identify the components of the existing product and then you systematically drop important components one by one.  In comparision, listening to the market would take you perhaps to corporate customers who would not be thinking of lounge chairs for the beach.<br />But more importantly, this book attacks the whole concept of brainstorming sessions.  They call this &quot;random&quot; generation of ideas.  This has what we have largely been doing for thousands of years.  They propose, and then demonstrate with their research results, that a systematic approach (using their Templates) produces ideas that have a higher probability of success.<br />The authors offer a GREAT bibiliography for each chapter.  That alone will keep me busy for at least 2 months.  The book is easy to read, but it tends to be a little too &quot;researchy&quot; in spots.<br />The book presents a systematic method to create ideas for advertisements.  I couldn't see where their methodology did better than mimicry of good ads.  However, they did offer a way to analyze the components of good ads.  One other criticism in this section on ads... the people that rated the ads were largely advertising professionals... and not the marketplace itself.  Therefore, the ads tended to be trivial... at least compared to the results you could get using the techniques for products.<br />I am convinced that this systematic method is very good for developing new products.  I have tried it on services and it did trigger some great ideas, although I found services to be more difficult to analyze.<br />Its a deep book for people serious about inventing things.  Its not a rah-rah book that presents motivational messages.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.  The authors have contributed largely to this field of inventiveness.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-06-13

He precisely defines his terms and moves step-by-step through the various aspects of preparing a strategic plan.<br />I liked the quantitative approach to many of his topics, although I think some of it may lead to subjective manipulation (pushing numbers around in a sandbox to get the effect you want).  Still, to compare strategies, putting a number on something definitely helps.  So, I liked his approach.<br />I found the author very easy to read, in many parts he was humorous.<br />I liked his tie-ins with military strategy.  Throughout the text the author provides quotes and insights on the parallel of military strategy.  But it is not overdone.  He also had interesting quotes from business luminaries (Drucker, Ansoff).<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone preparing a strategic plan for his company.  I noticed when searching for books listed in his bibliography (extensive) that Amazon is now carrying his most recent book \\"The Neglected Firm : Every Manager Must Manage Two Firms : The Present One and the Future One\\".  I'll be ordering that one soon, for sure.<br />Also, there are extensive and very interesting footnotes for each of the chapters in the back of the book.

I like the way they do their surveys and customer visits.<br />The first 1/3 of the book was a little dry, but the book overall is very easy to read.  It was hard to put down as I was very interested in how they would put the whole process together.  Some of the examples and tables needed more explanation.  They were not as clear as they could have been.  But overall this is a highly recomended book.  Probably a MUST READ.<br />Although this book is largely &quot;on target&quot; in terms of how to organize your customer-centric approach to product development... I think it lacks certain human intuitive points.  For example, there was no discussion of the name of the product, nor much on ergonomics.  This book needs to be read in conjunction of those by Barry Feig and Doug Hall.<br />In this regard, I would think that a company like HP would use this type of approach, but not Steve Jobs of Apple.<br />I learned several important quantitative approaches to measuring what the customer wants.  But at the same time I think their quantitative approach may be somewhat utopian.  For example, when you do your customer visits and later your surveys, you may find that you discover something new... so you scramble and change your questions to proceed further.  This would mess up the data in their approach.  Thus, I think the process is a little more messy in real life.  And, for really important decisions, intuition plays a greater role.  I don't think I made up a matrix decision chart when I decided to marry my wife.  There are alot of decisions that are like this in the product development area.<br />Another area where I had trouble was in the use of &quot;value mapping&quot; analysis in doing trade offs for deciding what features need to be included.  This is another one of those cases of over-relying on the matrix approach.  Suppossedly we are to determine a customer value -- either on productivity improvements, cost reduction or other subjective judgements.  Well, let me tell you, this is ripe for serious manipulation.  All you can do is get the customer to react to your designs.  You need to read the Barry Feig books for more discussion on this.<br />However, I will use their quantitative approach in my next product development quest, realizing that it may get messed up a little.  I really liked their discussion of how to do questionaires (the Kano method was terrific).<br />I thought their discussion of developing customer images was also great, but I got the feeling that this was not the author's forte, as this was more intuitive type of thing.  Regardless, this was valable to me and I'm glad they included this in the book.<br />Perhaps most important to me was their confirmation that the biggest reason for missing the customer's desires... was FAILURE TO PROBE.  I wholeheartedly agree.  That's one of the reasons I laugh when I see the mall interviewers asking all those closed-questions.  The author does a great job of discussion this.<br />The author, Sheila Mello, passes my test for a business author: she is a consultant in the field.  This is not a book by some college professor preaching his hands-off theories.<br />There was a lot that I agreed with in this book, and there was a lot of important ideas that I picked up, and will implement next time.  I recommend that this book be read before the Feig and Hall books to provide you a base foundation for your approach.<br />Highly recomended book, if not MUST READ.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2002-04-12

I thought it did a great job of covering these topics, and was very readable.  I read it in one evening (it's only 160 pages long, and includes lots of pretty drawings).<br />The book is written by Dominic O'Brien, a noted memorization wizard.  But it was interesting that the copyright to the book went to the publisher.  This is common for technical books in the computer field... where the publisher finds a hot topic and directs an author to write to their specifications.  But I believe this format to be unusual in the memorization field.  <br />The answer is found in the front cover where I discovered that there is a &quot;Learn to ...&quot; series put out by the publisher.  As such, this book probably follows a format for that series.  This format is very well done, but unfortunately reflects the comments made by an earlier reviewer: there is (or might be) more information on memory in the author's other books.<br />Regardless of all this backround info, I am happy I bought this book.  And, I think this book updates some of the techniques that I've seen elsewhere.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2001-12-30

There's everything from what to do first on a turnaround... to how to get the best price selling your company.  Nearly every page is heavily underlined in my book.<br />The topics that I particularly found valuable were: &quot;Find the margin, cut all other costs&quot;; &quot;Specialize, do it where the margin lives, stop everything else&quot;; &quot;franchising is more about real estate than the business&quot;;his chapter on &quot;make what sells&quot; and the importance of low cost and his abundant advice on how to cut costs; his recommendations on increasing price on certain product types; setting your debt levels at the &quot;10 year flood plain&quot; for your company; demoting IT because it operates with its own agenda; stopping the CFO from gambling; cutting down on consultants and moving them over to more of a performance basis... well the topics go on, but you get the idea.<br />There's lots of advice.

He also offers great coverage of each of the major vegetables that he recommends that you grow.  This part contains some particularly good material.<br />There are many practical and original techniques in this book.  Although this is not necessarily a beginner's book, I would recommend this book to a beginner.  The only problem I had was his reliance on chemical fertilizers.<br />Many beginners might find it easier at first to use standard chemical fertilizers, as recommended by the author.  However, today many gardeners are finding their way to organics to avoid the industrial wastes sometimes found in the standard chemical fertilizers.<br />I get the feeling that the author writes with your best interests at heart.  He appears to be a successful gardener with much practical experience.  His writing is very clear and at times quite humorous.  There are plenty of pictures and diagrams to keep the book interesting.<br />I use raised bed gardening, but use concrete blocks and take an organic approach.  Although the materials are different, the methodology is very similar.  I highly recommend this book to any one getting started, or anyone who wants to build raised bed gardens using wood (looks better than concrete blocks, but deteriortes more quickly).<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX	2001-11-25

Particularly global businessmen from the U.S.<br />Quoting from Marx and rhetorically asking what would Lenin do, the author disavows any responsibility for our corrupt and decrepit education system caused by his lower-brow brethern.  Yet, he is part of the educational establishment himself.<br />Other than his overt bias, the author has gathered some interesting &quot;oh, ain't it awful&quot; trivia from Jay Leno and beyond regarding the decline of our country and Western Civilization.  <br />He's right of course.  But his solution is for all the Atlantic Monthly readers to go off into the wilderness and pretend they are the Irish monks of the Middle Ages.  Not a bad idea if they take the Washington Post readers with them.<br />You will find the writing to be entertaining and engaging.  If you're a liberal, you'll just love this book.  If you're an educator you will, hopefully, feel disappointed in your results... but you will feel no blame, as its the businessmen who are starving the funding our schools (not true, of course).  <br />As the author points out, if you are part of 94 per cent of the population, you will not be reading this (or any) book.  Only the conservatives and business people should feel enraged, as they are blamed for all the ills in the world.<br />The author is very correct in pointing out that our educational abilities have been declining since 1960 or so.  For example, our educators have reset the SAT scores to give test takers a higher score.  <br />He also points out that the poor are getting poorer and the rich getting richer.  Although this could be debatable by some, I tend to agree.  But the author fails to address the massive immigration of uneducated people that has occured in the last 30 years, which has skewed many of the numbers.  In fact, the author skims over a lot of other details that should be considered (unionization of education, increased governmental involvement in education, more people taking college exams, for example).<br />When talking about tax cuts, he proposes that the overwhelming majority of them went to the rich people.  What we know is that poor people don't pay income taxes.  Statistics clearly show that the top 10 per cent of the income earners are paying most of the taxes.  Thus, the tax cuts were going (somewhat) back to the people that paid them.  He never mentions this.  This kind of unbalanced reporting or logic shows throughout the book.<br />I would have given this book a 1 or 2, but the author does weave a very interesting tale.  He also provides lots of interesting statistics to back up the decline of Western Civilization part.<br />John Dunbar	2001-09-10

In the case of teleselling, I want someone who sells mostly by the phone.  At least, they have to prospect by phone.  This author states:<br />\\"I will be selling right up until my last breath... For me, heaven will be a small room with a telephone and a never-ending list of prospects... you cannot succeed at what you do not love. I am going to work very hard on making you love to prospect.\\"<br />and <br />\\"I have two businesses of my own and attribute much of my success to my cold calling prowess... I have developed a prospecting and business development system that works!\\"<br />I'd say that this author is well qualified and, the book turns out very well.<br />At first I thought that my kind of business couldn't use teleselling: it was much too dignified.  Then (this is a true story) I was sitting in a clients office reviewing my computer designs when I heard the client play back his voice messages outloud.  One was from a competitor who was selling the same kind of services I provided.  How could this be?  I listened very closely and was extremely impressed with his technique.  And had I been that customer receiving that call earlier, I might have responded to their prospecting call.<br />This book is highly recommended.	2001-07-13

This book reflects what a marketing oriented copywriter might say about a field he's not intimately experienced with.<br />This book is appropriate for someone in the consulting area that is just beginning telephone sales.  For someone who is already doing it, or has a small library of books in this area... you might be disappointed.<br />However, BUY ALL THE OTHER BOOKS BY BLY... and I'm serious.  He is a great author on marketing and copywriting.  Some of his other works are real gems (like the ones on business-to-business and direct marketing).  I get the feeling that he wrote this book to flesh out his line of marketing books, and that has weakened it.<br />The better books in telephone selling are done by people who do it day in and day out.  I bought all the materials from Bill Good, and also from Art Sobsczack (sp?) who has a newsletter is especially good for professionals.  The kind of person who writes this kind of book needs to be a SALESMAN first, and a marketer second because most of the problems deal with tactical issues.  Selling with paper (direct mail) is a different kettle of fish than figuring out what to say the gatekeeper.<br />John Dunbar	2001-07-13

He then applies great thinking and action to turn around their sales.<br />The author tells you lots of stories of his successes and then describes the techniques that he used.  There's lots of practical advice here.<br />He has just released another book, &quot;Market Outrageously&quot;, in 2001.  I have just finished reading the new one, and read this older one when it came out about 3 years ago.  In some ways this older, original book has more material.  However, the newer book adds to this information and has enough new material to make the purchase worthwhile.  If you are a marketing professional, or a business owner, you should buy both.<br />Or, buy the newer book first, then if you like the style and information, then buy this older book to supplement the first.<br />You can also see my review comments for &quot;Marketing Outrageously&quot; in that book's review section.<br />Both books are fun and easy to read.  In both books you'll be totally absorbed in the material.<br />The author has strong opinions and has produced strong results.  So I rank this book as &quot;highly recommended.&quot;<br />John Dunbar	2001-07-08
US	53053083	RAAO9WCB5T262	1885167504	510876097	Marketing Outrageously: How to Increase Your Revenue by Staggering Amounts!	Books	5	30	30	N	N	Great update to his previous book	The author, Jon Spoelstra, is a hired gun marketing consultant who goes in and turns around companies with severe lack of revenues.  Most of them are sports teams.  So, we could think of him as a serial-turnaround artist.  For this reason, you should read the book to see his techniques in action.<br />This is his second book.  The other is &quot;Ice To The Eskimos&quot;.  This book is very similar to the first book.  I consider this second book an update to the previous one.  Both are highly recommended.  In some ways I thought the first book had more meat.  This second book is easier to read.<br />The author has about 20 major points that he makes in both books.  One such point is to think outrageously when working on your marketing ideas and programs.  He gives lots of stories and anecdotes to help you in this regard.  <br />Another point by the author is the use of direct marketing over indirect marketing.  He recommends that you let the customer tell you when to stop running the ad based on the returns that it generates.  He gives lots of examples.  His recommendations regarding TV ads follows the recommendations of Roy Williams, who wrote &quot;Wizard of Ads&quot; by the same publisher.  In TV he recommends that you dominate a niche, or segment.<br />On one hand he believes in accepting the product as a given.  Many sales and marketing people blame poor sales results on the product, just as a failed warrior is quick to blame his weapons.   He believes most of the problems are caused by lack of creativity and action.  But on the other hand, the author guides you on how to change your product offering.  One technique is to understand what business you are really in.  He gives you some checklists and examples on how to do this.<br />The author is totally revenue focused.  He foresakes short term profitability to build revenues so he can pick up profitablity on subsequent purchases.  <br />The hallmark of this second book is a call to action to write two importantquestions on a 3x5 card... and carry it around with you.  To find out those questions you'll need to buy and read the book.<br />After reading this book you should have several important things to change for your business.  So it is highly recommended.  I would have given this book a &quot;4&quot; but because he made the case so convincingly that the CEO and chief marketing guy should make frequent sales calls... that I had to bump the score up to a &quot;5&quot;.  Read the book to find out why.<br />I think there are better 5's out there, but this one will pay you dividends if you apply some of his recommendations.  He is a player with real experience.<br />John Dunbar	2001-07-08

It covers alot of material (maybe too much) and yet it is a relatively small book.  I liked the book for its comprehensive coverage and links to entrepreneurship as a personal mission... as well as marketing.<br />The authors are Canadian and I'd like to say that their nationality interfered with the topics or slant of the book... but it didn't.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that this Swiss-banking immigrant (Bender) and this successful radio broadcaster (Torok) in Canada really had their feet on the ground.  They offered lots of practical marketing and strategic advice.<br />I would suggest that there are two major parts to this book.  The first 1/6 of the book describes their concept of delivering value, tieing your products/services to personal values, and your vision/mission statements, etc.  I thought this was truly great and apparently some of it flows from Peter Urs Bender's other book: Leadership from Within.  I see that it is favorably reviewed here at Amazon and I will order it right away (forthwith in Canadian?).<br />The remaining 5/6's of the book is an encyclopedic account of marketing techniques that you can (and should) apply for your business.  The target market for this book is a firm of 1 to 30 employees... a small firm.  This book would also do well for an individual working for a big company, as it tells you how to market yourself to become more valuable.<br />There's a ton of good ideas here.  You won't go wanting of things to implement.  There are new ideas that you won't see elsewhere.<br />For example, they speak about the need to write articles to establish your expertise.  They then go on to list many different kinds of articles you can write.  Under this section, one sub-topic was Tips Sheets.  There they listed about 10 different kinds of tip sheets you could write.  I knew about writing articles and tip sheets, but they provided excellent lead ideas to get me going.  There were many other such new thingsin their book that greatly extended the topics I was already familiar with.<br />Because it was encyclopedic in coverage, I was worried that it would repeat alot of what I already knew.  But, instead I learned a lot of new ideas that I can implement.  Overall, I highly recommend this book for any small business owner, or marketing chief... or any individual who wants to shine and promote himself within a corporation.<br />Now if we could just figure out some way to get these good business thinkers out of the cold socialist northern territories!  I found the book in a Vancouver bookstore and have never seen it in the U.S.<br />John Dunbar	2001-07-06

When it comes to raw food, it is difficult to make food &quot;tasty&quot;.  But this author wins the prize, as he offers many great recipes.  The thing I like about this book has been the great sauces.  The book is also beautifully photographed.  <br />In my opinion, the author, who is also has a successful restaurant in San Francisco, looks a little weird with his California long hair and cut-short T-Shirts, but his recipes are just terrific.  As far as I know there is no other book that moves your food into the &quot;cuisine&quot; area using raw food.  So if you're tired of the same ole salad, this is the book to move you to the next level.<br />My wife's friends all think the same of this book.  This is a must have book if you are preparing lots of raw dishes... or if you just want to impress your dinner guests.  Raw foods don't have to be bland, this is the ticket to your success.  The author is a genius when it comes to raw food.<br />John Dunbar	2001-07-02

I have both.  The 2nd edition was released in 1985.  Both editions are heavily underlined and dog-eared from repeated readings.<br />This MIT professor has done a masterful job at describing the process of making predictions and forecasting.  The book is extremely easy to read and is well footnoted.  This is obviously a labor of love for this expert on forecasting.<br />You'll laugh at some of his stories of predictions gone astray or methodologies foolishly executed.  There's not much math to this book (680 pages) but there is a lot of logic and thinking going on.<br />This book covers all the major forms of forecasting and discusses the pro's and con's of each method.  It provides many, many examples of forecasts.  He then analyzes them to back up his major points.<br />Then goes on to recommend why you should combine forecast methodologies to increase your accuracy.  If you're an economist making forecasts on the economy, or if your a stock analyst making forecasts for Earnings, you'll enjoy this book.  The book is aimed at researchers preparing forecasts for economics and social sciences.  My interest was in the stock market and commoditiy markets.  And I feel I was richly rewarded with this book.<br />This book gives you the framework to work within.  Other books give the math background for each of the techniques.<br />The author has been very active in writing articles for journals and has helped start a journal for the forecasting field.<br />Must have book, if you make any kind of forecasts - including just forecasting your business's sales.  I can't recommend it highly enough.<br />John Dunbar	2001-06-18

So good authors were probably forced to follow a bad format.<br />That format apparently required glitzy graphics which overpowered the book.  Each small page seemed to be on a separate topic... much like a Power Point slide presentation.<br />There was disappointingly little coverage of the math side of the material.  OK, there really was next to none.  The saving grace was the coverage of where fractals were being used in practical applications.<br />Let me tell you a little more on these graphics.  They were (professionally done) hand drawn cartoons.  Mostly of famous mathematicians having quirky things to say about the subject, on an 8th grade level.<br />Overall, I think the authors did a fair job of trying to jamb an excellent subject into a stupid book format.  The problem lies most likely at the feet of the publisher.  This format makes sense for some of their other 8th grade books: &quot;Introducing Feminism&quot;... Freud... Jung... Marx... Einstein, etc.  How they were able to pull off &quot;Introducing Math&quot; in one of these small books is probably a story in and of itself.  They even have an &quot;Introducing a Post-Feminism&quot; book, if the first one was not enough.<br />This book was not a complete zero for me, as I did learn many new things.  It was a fast read, but I think I have yet to find the best introductory book on Fractals.  If you buy this book, you'll never have to pick up a pencil and solve a problem, or even use a calculator.  It's just all... a quick read.<br />John Dunbar	2001-06-15

The authors distill the experience of fast growing, entrepreneurial companies into a series of rules.<br />There's lots of ideas to put to use.  The business stories that illustrate their points are very interesting.<br />An example of some of their points are: shuffle people around, tell stories, rank everyone annually, have a cause and a crusade, CEO's must make alot of sales calls and must be 1/2 time evangelical, you invite new hires to be part of the crusade, break your goals into activities and then publicly track results against those activities.<br />There's lots of details behind those points and many more points.  But that should give you an idea of the book.  I highly recommend it.  It generated lots of ideas which I wrote in the margins of my book.<br />John Dunbar	2001-06-11

This was the book that helped fill in the blanks on other (college-style) texts.  This is not an easy book to read.  It is a clear and quick explanation of the logic behind multivariate statistics.  Sometimes that logic is involved, but you can master it by reading more slowly.<br />I think after finishing this book, or in parallel with it, you would want another text that has lots of practical exercises.<br />Highly recommended... if you're one of those that wants to know the &quot;why&quot; behind the &quot;what&quot;.<br />John D.	2001-05-30

First, this is an excellent book to read.  Well researched, edited, and from experts active in the field.<br />Second, the author makes many important recommendations about how you should manage your company... strategically.  Again, these recommendations are based largely on research done by the author or his peers mostly at Bain & Co. regarding maintaining competitive advantage.<br />With the exception of Jack Welch (and previously Geneen at IT&T, I'm sure), large conglomerates can not maintain growth rates over long periods of time (ten years was the period used in the book).<br />So, the recommendations that your company stick to its knitting (\\"the core\\") is the foundation of the book.  But many people already know this.  So, most interesting, are the recommendations and research that show the nuances.<br />For example, the author shows how the areas around your core business offer the most profitable opportunities for fast growth... yet also contain the most dangers from encroaching competitors, or bad fitting investments.  He calls this area your adjacency.<br />The author suggests that how you manage your adjacency largely determines your success at long term business growth.<br />There are too many concepts and details to summarize here.  There is a lot of meat to the book (although it is not a huge book).  Still it is fairly easy to read.  You will not whiz through the book because you will often pause to consider the ramifications of the author's points.  But it is not a difficult read.<br />The books major points are well illustrated with many examples (Dell, Microsoft, Starbucks, W.W. Grainger, etc.).<br />This book is most appropriate for management involved in strategy, and investors trying to figure out the appropriateness of acquisitions by companies.<br />Most of the pages in my book are underlined.  The stories fit the observations and recommedations well.  The research presented was most interesting, and was often summarized into easily read charts and tables.<br />I highly recommend this book.  There are lots of implementable ideas in this book.  As an investor you will be able to spot an inappropriate acquisition much more easily. ...	2001-05-28

Then I realized that he was truly a profilic inventor.  His method of telling us about the invention process was to illustrate each of the methods he used with real stories of inventions.  Stories that happened (mostly) to him.<br />It is very easy to read, and the author went out the way to get an artist to support his points with illustrations.  As I read the book I became intrigued with all of his inventions.  After a while I started saying to myself... &quot;Gosh, I can't believe he invented this under those conditions.&quot;<br />Particularly interesting was his analysis of what the people on the Titanic could have done to save the ship.<br />I think there are better academic books about the invention process out there... but there are few that offer a look inside the mind of someone who invented so many products.<br />John Dunbar	2001-05-21

The author writes well.  He also documents his points with out-of-the-way footnotes.<br />He bares his soul to the reader.<br />His most important point to me was the need to find out what we are good at doing.  Build up our strengths and don't shore up our weaknesses.<br />I'd say this could have been a &quot;4 PLUS&quot; book, but I had to give it a &quot;5&quot; because of all the recommended actions that I was able to glean from the book.  Although all of the stories were interesting, certain subjects in the last 1/2 of the book (those I thought I knew about) got a little tedious.  But the interesting stories kept me reading through to the end.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.<br />John Dunbar	2001-05-21

Great on inventing	The book is very easy to read, and it is very interesting.  The author weaves in the need for patents and other intellectual property protection very well into the invention process.  This is far better coverage on the strategy of patents than I have ever read before.<br />But for me the best part was the overall process recommended by the author.  He shows us how to have marketing and manufacturing concerns guide the invention process from the beginning.  He also presents a very detailed analysis of how to go about inventing a product using the problems and concerns of the customer as a basis for your product.  This, again, was very well done.<br />The author has invented, and now teaches inventing.  This book serves as his seminar material.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />John Dunbar	2001-03-30

This book handles them well.  This book clearly describes the concepts of Shareholder Value.  I think this book, and many of its SV kind, are great for corporate financial people who have (mostly) accurate accounting numbers.  <br />But for investors looking in from the outside, SV becomes difficult to implement.  For example, what truly is EBITDA? Cash Flow?  Which one?  These illusive investor numbers make the SV process hard to implement for those of us without access to the real corporate books.  Or at least, the process of determining the correct numbers is more difficult than the SV process lets on... in the world where accounting numbers and forecasts can be made to be anything the CEO or CFO want.  <br />All in all, this methodology has brought a revolution to the corporate financial world.  Divisions can now be compared with more rigor.  This book easily and clearly explains the logic.  The authors care about their subject and it shows.  <br />John Dunbar	2001-03-16

Unlike his previous books that went in depth on marketing research and product development, this book covers the whole water front of marketing.<br />When I quickly scanned the book I didn't like that Feig was getting outside of the specialty I had him pigeon-holed in.  But, when I read the book I was extremely pleased.  The subtitle to his book is &quot;Hundreds of Proven-Effective Marketing and Sales Strategies for Every Business Situation.&quot;  Well, this is exactly what the book delivered.  There were probably several hundred such tips, tricks and strategies.<br />The book is easy to read.  It is much more organized than his previous books.  Like his previous books it contains lots of real life examples to illustrate the point he is making.<br />Below I list the chapter headings and because of word limitations on these reviews, I only comment on the first several chapters:<br />1) Proven Strategies to Build Marketing Success    (I liked one of his sections &quot;Six Quick Product Marketing Strategies.&quot;  It recommended: 1) Develop new uses, 2) Make a minor cosmetic change, 3) Develop a new name, 4) Make it more convenient, 5) Put in a new performance que, 6) Make the product fun.)<br />2) Strategies for Developing Action Plans    (I really liked his Segmentation Strategies section, and his discussions on Emotional Hot Buttons)<br />3) Strategies for Conducting Successful Market Research    (&quot;The poorest view of the market is from your office.&quot;  This chapter is Feig's specialty, and it shows.  He's put in information not found in his previous books.  I really liked his discussion on how to use focus groups effectively.  Feig is known for his position that focus groups should only react to what you show them, not try to intellectualize or brainstorm with you.  You want them to &quot;react just like they do in the real world.&quot;  He really covers what not to do, which I found important.)<br />4) Strategies for Written Communictions and Presentations   (This was an OK chapter.  The points about how people remember things when you are moving was very helpful.  This also demonstrates Feig's perceptive psychological grasp of things.)<br />5) Strategies to Implement Marketing Programs and Advertising<br />6) Strategies for Choosing Advertising Agencies and Other Suppliers<br />7) Strategies for Point of Sale, Impulse Items, and Trade Shows<br />8) Strategies for Pricing and Adding Value<br />9) Sellingand Marketing Strategies that Create Record Sales<br />10) Strategies for Speeding up the New Product Developement<br />11) Strategies For Making Distributors and Merchants Ecstatic<br />12) Proven Strategies for Turnaround Situations and Repositionings<br />13) Strategies to Make Your Package and Product Name Sell... Sell... Sell<br />14) Stragies for Marketing Through the New Media<br />15) Stratgies for Fund Raising   (I didn't read this one)<br />16) Strategies for Cashing in on Business Alliances<br />17) Private Label Strategies Pay Off for Retailers and Suppliers Alike   (This was really new material for me.

The author has helped develop many products primarily for the food trade.  This book is a major rewrite to his &quot;The New Products Workshop: Hands-On Tools for Developing Winners.&quot;  Both books are great.  If you can't get both, then get this newer one.<br />This book is important because it details Barry Feig's proprietary product development process.  As a consultant he goes in to large food companies and helps them develop ideas and marketing programs for new products.  There are very few books on this topic.<br />I highly recommend this book.  The only downside to this book is that it could stand a little more organiziing of the topics.  Overall though, this is a book that you should buy if you are at all interested in how to develop new products and how to test them with the marketplace.<br />Perhaps the most unique thing is how he recomends that you meet one on one with the customer in developing your product proto-types.  He tells you exactly what to show the prospective customers and what to ask them.<br />Peppered throughout the book are stories about new product developement that he has experienced.<br />Great book.	2001-03-16

The author made it very interesting.  Most important points are his insights into growth investing and how to make it different than the other popular methods.  <br />Although there are lots of quantitative recomendations, I particularly liked his qualitative ones.  For example, his recommendations on how to size up management were very good.<br />I think it would be easy for anyone to follow his quantitative advice: coming up with ways to screen out stocks based on financial statistics.  But the real test is in applying the qualitative screens -- this is what makes the horse race.<br />In this light, his comments on: competitive advantage, loving companies that customers love, looking for long term thinkers were great.<br />On the negative side, I think he could have better described the relationship between growth rates and PE ratios.  Also, I think he knows alot more than he has told us.  I hope he comes out with another book, or a newsletter that describe his views.<br />I enjoyed his discussion about how growth rates return to a mean, and how to adjust your PE ratios to use next years numbers.  Although his discussion of competitive advantage was good, I think there's a lot more here that could have been discussed.<br />Overall, I rank it as &quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.&quot;<br />John Dunbar	2001-03-16

However, the author doesn't disclose any earth shattering ideas or proprietary practices of the firm.  There's the obligatory kudos from from the likes of (smash everything that's standing) Tom Peters.<br />Still, the stories of one invention after another are quite illuminating.  I recommend you buy the book for the general background of a very inventive company, not for any specific techniques.  That the book is printed on some really fancy ($$$) paper makes me think that this might have been designed to be a vanity book.<br />I wished they had discussed more on the methods of market research.  The author reports that IDEO's direct to the consumers themselves to observe and ask questions.  No focus groups for them.  I wish their exact techniques had been developed in much more detail.  Otherwise, we are left to assume that the folks at IDEO just attack like Banshee's with no strategy, techniques or direction.<br />When reading the book you will feel that you are right there working alongside the IDEO teams on a project... unfortunately they are probably all-nighters.  Recommended for died-in-the-wool inventor and entrepreneurial types.  I enjoyed it.<br />...	2001-03-05

Books	5	16	16	N	N	Lots of practical advice illustrated with real stories	This is an easy read, and it's hard to put it down.<br />His basic process is easily summed up: 1) Solve a Problem, 2) Prove Your Invention/Build a Prototype, 3) Protect Your Idea, 4)Manufacture or License?, 5) Market with a Twist.  And, those are his 5 main chapters.  He shows you how he has done this repeatedly.  He's a serial inventor/business starter.<br />What I particularly liked was his detailed description of how he did &quot;hands on&quot; market research.  He shows you how to prove out your invention early within the marketplace.  <br />From an invention point of view, he works primarily from finding problems.  He describes his personal experience in all the chapters.  There is no college theory here.<br />I highly recommend this book for entrepreneurs and inventors.  It's a fast read, but you'll probably come back and review it periodically.<br />John Dunbar	2001-03-05

It should read &quot;How to Keep Exceeding Your Previous Best: in business and personal life.&quot;<br />The author offers lots of small chapters that can be digested quickly, and then put to use in your life and your business ventures.  They are short exercises in your road to achievement.<br />As the title suggests, the book is about responding to change, but it is more than that.  It is more about getting yourself to &quot;Ask big questions&quot; and &quot;Set Unreasonable Goals&quot; so that your business ventures and personal life will exceed your previous expectations.<br />This author shows you how to get quantum leaps in your productivity, and performance.<br />Actually I'd give this book a higher score than 5, but 5 is the highest at Amazon.  I look forward to this author's upcoming book.<br />Again, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Actually, I'd call it REQUIRED READING.<br />John Dunbar	2000-10-08

The author has lots of experience, but fails to mention many double blind tests on meat eating... particularly on fat consumption.  The author does present lots of information on various groups that are healthy and are meat eaters (Eskimos, tribes in Africa).  He also presents some longevity statistics of vegetarians vs. meat eaters... that favors the meat eaters.  I think the definitive book has yet to be written, and the cause of atherscerlosis remains to be determined.  Overall I thought it was a good book and I'll keep it next to my Ornish/McDougal - vegetarian-style, low-fat books.<br />Easy to read, well organized.<br />John Dunbar	2000-09-26

Books	5	15	16	N	N	Big book, lots of practical ideas, low cost techniques	This is another book by Dobkin covering his multiple exposure marketing methods.  There's over 350 pages of checklists, resources, and great ideas.  Here's a synopsis of the contents:<br />I - Big Results from Free Press (publicity) - 30 sections outlining how to create a PR campaign that gets published.  This was very well done, and I wish he would come out with a book on this topic exclusively.<br />II - Direct Mail - 46 sections outlining how to create a direct mail campaign.  These 46 are organized into 3 main sub-sections:<br />a - In Direct Mail Your Success May Be Just 32 Cents Away,<br />b -Other Elements of a Direct Mail Package<br />c - Lists: the Most Important Element in Any Mailing.<br />III - Marketing Through Magazines.  This is broken into 4 sub-sections totalling 32 different topics:<br />a - Overview (how to integrate with PR releases, etc.),<br />b - Research Tools of the Trade Made Easy,<br />c - The One Evening Marketing Plan,<br />d - Marketing Through Magazines with Paid Advertising.<br />IV - Ads.  This is broken down into 4 sub-sections containing 30 different topics.  The sub-sections are:<br />a - Overview (writing your ads to an objective... a favorite of his, you'll also see it in his other book on Uncommon Marketing),<br />b - Types of Headlines<br />c - Business to Business Inquiry Generating Ads<br />d - Ad Design and Procurement<br />V - The $500 Campaign.  Here he has 11 sections put together a complete campaign. * - He even includes a few pages in the back of the book for the &quot;A Technique for Delaying Brain Death in Heart Attack Victims&quot; as a public service.  At first I looked at this and said &quot;Huh?&quot;, then after I read it I was amazed at Dobkins concern for others.  He really describes a zero cost way even a child could use on an adult having a heart attack.<br />What I liked about this book:<br />+ Lots of practical advice,<br />+ He organizes the material to help your marketing campaigns,<br />+ He covers PR as an important element, as well as direct marketing,<br />+ He pushes multiple-exposure marketing (which I agree is very  powerful - as I've used in on software letters and tracked the results),<br />+ He gives copywriting advice for your letters and ads,<br />+ Very good coverage of &quot;the offer&quot;.  I particularly liked his concept of &quot;complementing the offer&quot; (adding on guarantees, etc.).  He gives lots of examples here.<br />+ He describes a marketing cost model that you can use.<br />+ How to buy and position magazine ads,<br />+ Use of low cost techniques (inquiry generating ads, postcards)<br />+ Lots of reproduced examples (letters, mag ads, postcards, classifieds)<br />+ Long list of resources.<br />I liked this book very much.  After I bought it, several years later he came out with the Uncommon Marketing book.  I bought that one also.  Although there is a certain amount of overlap, I'm happy I bought both.  They are both rated an &quot;A +&quot; read, and make great reference books to keep on your shelf forever.<br />You can also see my my review of his other book at Amazon.  I believe this book lives up to the claim in the title: you can market a product for as little as $500, or at least get it rolling.<br />John Dunbar	2000-09-25

Also, it is not technical stock picking or momentum picking either.  He uses external factors like growth rates, competitive analysis of the industry, proprietary nature of the firm's assets.  This is the primary value of the book.<br />If you follow the advice from this book you will be investing in high growth stocks using the criteria mentioned above.<br />Other authors who have developed similar, or related, thinking include Geoffrey Moore and A. David Silver.  I would recommend their books as well.<br />I did not think this book shilled for their web site.  I don't understand other reviewers' comments on this.  The author's enthusiasm did bubble over a few times, but there was no blatant sales pitches in this book.<br />Overall: Buy this book if you want to get involved in growth stocks.  Also, this book fairly presents the building of a stock selection methodology.  You will see how your stock selection system should be reduced to rules, as this one is.<br />John Dunbar	2000-09-21

Oh, it's great for people just starting out in consulting.  But it is doubtful they will fully appreciate  the advice in this book.<br />If you have read Million Dollar Consulting by  the same author then you will be prepared for his recommendation on billing  on value... not on hours.<br />In this book, Dr. Weiss presents his grand  unified recommendations on the proper way to organize and start your  consulting practice.  This book is easy to read.  And, there's lots of  examples of real situations.<br />Dr. Weiss has a web site and lists other  materials for sale.  I reviewed one of his videos on line and he is very  humorous in person.  <br />He claims to make more than $1 million per year  consulting (and speaking).  He went from 0 to over $1 million in 6 years.   He's an organizational consultant.<br />I rate this book a MUST READ if you  are a consultant.  I've also ordered his other materials.  A fair amount of  this other material was included in this new book.<br />John Dunbar	2000-09-20

It bogs down a little thereafter.<br />The first ten or so essays are truly great, and alone justify  the purchase of this book.  The author describes how to write ads and also  presents an approach to life.  The ad part is truly great, but the life  part should be in another book.  Still, I consider this a great book for  someone looking for copy writing secrets.<br />The author also has a web site  and free email letters with similar material.  He also provides training  seminars.  I've noticed from his web site that alot of radio types attend  his seminars.  That fits, as he encourages you to use echoic (sound)  techniques in writing your ad copy.<br />John	2000-09-19

Like... major transitions buried deep in paragraphs.   Were the sub-heads put there for decoration?  The egotistical  patty-pat-pat's could have been edited out more.  And, where's the  meat?<br />The concept of the book is great, the author is experienced, but  the book falls somewhat flat.<br />This book is like Doug Hall's &quot;Jump  Start Your Brain&quot; but minus a lot of its content.  <br />Still, there are  some great ideas here.  You should buy this book for its references and a  few of its ideas.  It's an easy read -- and that reflects it's lightness on  detail.<br />One thing I thought was important is the concept of Mihaly  Csikszentmihalyi on the 3 areas of creativity: the expert, the domain, the  judges.  <br />Most books discuss how to improve the individual -- the expert.   But there are 2 other important areas.  The domain is the marketplace...  with its competitors, etc.  This would be the source of ideas and demand  for ideas.  The judges are the rewarders of new ideas.  In some cases this  might be the users who will purchase your product.  In other cases it might  be the companies that purchase your ideas.  They provide value and rewards  to the idea generator.  We must evaluate and improve all three of these  areas.  Or, select those areas were there's a good match of all  three.<br />Thankfully, Csikszentmihalyi's books are referenced and discussed.   This book also discusses other references as well.<br />After reading the  book I believe the author is a sincere and knowledgeable person.  But I  believe the purpose of this book was to sell his idea-generating company.   Given that off-the-mark main direction, it is no wonder there were so many  self-congradulatory anecdotes.  The purpose of the book should be to  explain his major techniques, and the by-product, or secondary objective,  should be to sell his company.<br />Overall recommendation: buy it to fill out  your creativity library.  Otherwise, there are better books on this  subject.<br />John Dunbar	2000-08-20

David Silver has written many business books -- and most present his  formulaic approach to evaluating (or starting) companies that have a  proprietary advantage in the market place.<br />If you are going to start a  company, or if you are going to invest in a company... you must get one of  his books on this subject.  This book provides a summary of that formula,  and then applies that to stocks in existance at the time of its  publication.<br />You couldn't ask for a better way to learn his method.   About 1 year after I had read the book and talked about it to a friend, we  went back and saw that his selections had done quite well.<br />Whether this  is a great stock selection method remains to be objectively tested.  But I  believe his method of analyzing a company based on proprietary hold on a  market... to be sound.<br />In general: buy anything by this author.  I  do.<br />John Dunbar	2000-08-20

I  ordered this book from Amazon after I read another of his books,  Infilitration Marketing).  I thought the previous book was A+, and I give  that score to this book as well.  I have also ordered his Marketing Plan  book, but haven't read it yet.<br />I put this book up their with those of  Barry Feig (Straight to the Heart, The New Products Workshop).  But this  book, Bringing Your Product To Market, is the best overall book for product  development - more encompassing.  It has lots of marketing material, but  also lots of new product development ideas, how (and if, when) to license,  how to manufacture (mostly contract manufacture).  His book is the best  over all book... and thus would be that one book to buy that includes it  all.<br />Unlike other books on new product marketing, he doesn't go endlessly  on about how to patent your product, how to hire a lawyer, and other side  issues.  This is much more practical: it presents a phased plan of new  product development, market research, market testing, etc.  Contract  manufacturing, patents and licensing (excellently done) is then discussed  in terms of this phased approach.<br />The purpose of this book is to get you  away from developing a monument to yourself and to control urging of your  ego to not listen to what the market is trying to say.  His checklist and  phased approach almost forces you to spend less on the front end than you  normally would, and to constantly check the market's reactions.  In this  regard, the book is EXCELLENT PLUS.  I have not seen any other book that is  so practical, yet filled with marketing insight.  I would say that if you  followed his advice, you would triple your odds of success.<br />Every page  oozes with practical experience (he consults with new product developers).   He gives ratios and rules of thumbs for many subjects... again,based on  his experience.  He also provides lots of examples that illustrate his  points.  I would recommend that you order any of this guy's stuff.  His  marketing book was great, and I look forward to reading his marketing plan  book.<br />I would also recommend your reading Feig's book, which goes into  more detail in the market research and product idea development  phase.<br />Oh, one last thing, I underlined about 60 % of just about every  page in this book.  I've filed it under the Dewey Decimal System of  &quot;A+&quot;.<br />John Dunbar	2000-08-08

I got the feeling that the authors were glossing over some  science a little too quickly.  Also, I didn't see how they could be so  conversant on DNA... as astrophysists or geologists.<br />On a plus side,  there are many great references to other books, magazine articles and  respected journals.<br />The basic gist of the book is: once you get past the  almost impossible odds of duplicating another Earth, there are the  incredible odds of making RNA (or DNA which is even more complicated), and  duplicating the environmental conditions that allow multi-cellular  beings.<br />We can demonstrate making amino acids, but we have no idea how  nature made RNA or DNA.<br />So this, and other deductions, leads to their  conclusion that higher forms of life (&quot;ET&quot;) is very unlikely on  other planets.<br />Again, this is a great read.<br />John Dunbar	2000-07-29

Please note that the reviews on this 2nd Edition are mixed with the reviews of the poorer 1st Edition.  But they should be considered separate books -- because this new one is such a remarkable improvement over the first.<br />This is the BEST BOOK SO FAR FOR UNDERSTANDING PYTHON BASICS AT A DETAILED LEVEL.  It is a delight to read, the explanations are very clear, and the material is dense: every paragraph has something technical and interesting to say, at a fair level of depth.  For me, this book is the only Python book that sets off a little lightbulb in my head on WHY things work the way they do in Python.<br />Also, this is the best work by Mark Lutz so far.  He appears to be the major writer in this book (discussing the Python Core), while David Ascher worked on \\"the Outer Layers.\\"  Ascher also was co-writer on the Python Cookbook.<br />The 1st Edition was superficial in my mind.  I had originally ranked the 1st Edition as a 3 out of 5.  But this 2nd Edition reflects the authors' training and writing of other books and materials and clearly is a 5 or better.<br />This 2nd Edition takes you through version 2.2 of Python and discusses many aspects of version 2.3.  This was very important for me as I wanted to know about the many changes in 2.0 and 2.2.<br />I recommend this book most highly.  Its required for learning Python and would make an excellent teacher's reference, particularly great are the exercises with answers and more discussion in the Appendix.<br />John Dunbar<BR>Sugar Land, TX<BR>April, 2004	2000-07-23

Second, it's from a consultant, and not a university/marketing professor (the kiss of death).<br />But most importantly  the author starts with the customer.  He shows you how to identify your  type of customer.  Then he lists and illustrates many different low cost  ways to find customers of that type.<br />Finally, its a practical book  because it gives you checklists to fill in for your own business.  This  gets you involved with the ideas he presents in his book.<br />The book has  250 pages with about 20 of those as appendices.  It is divided into 13 easy  to read chapters.  The Table of Contents shows the following:<br />1 A New Era  of Marketing Is Here (his version of why infiltration marketing is  important)<br />2 A Different Look at Marketing Fundamentals (he gets you to  price out your marketing model... from prospects to customers)<br />3  Targeting the Right Customer Group (I thought this was great)<br />4  Discovering What Motivates Your Customer (again, this was great)<br />5  Finding the Actual Prospects (again, great)<br />6 Creating Awareness in  Potential Customers<br />7 Understanding the Customer's Buying Process<br />8  Matching Your Efforts with Prospects' Buying Activities<br />9 Finding Out  What Customers Want but Aren't Getting<br />10 Communicating Your message in a  Hurry<br />11 Producing an Impact<br />12 Creating Immediate Credibility<br />13  Offering Answers to Customer Goals<br />14 Establishing the Price/Value  Relationship<br />15 Using Promotions to Generate Sales<br />16 Building a Loyal  Customer Base<br />17 Setting up Cross-Promotions and Alliances<br />I found many  great marketing ideas in the first 5 chapters.

Back then it was Ries and Trout, instead of Ries and Ries (his daughter).<br />In the older books his basic message was very simple (niche and be the first in the mind of the  buyer, position).<br />Ries and Trout are credited with popularizing this  positioning subject.<br />From this very simple message, they wrote books that  endlessly repeated this important, but very simple, message.  Thus, his  previous books were tedious, and sometimes boring.  I had the same problem  with Andy Grove's book, with his basic theme of &quot;Only the Paranoid  Survive&quot;: one concept... many pages.<br />Thus, I thought his previous  books were over kill.  But this book is different.  Maybe because Ries's  daughter kept him on track.<br />This is one of the best books on branding  that I've read so far.  And, it really does a great job on discussing  branding as it applies to internet sites.<br />For example, don't even think  of naming your web site without reading this book.  From reading this book,  I have a much better understanding of how to structure my web site, how to  name it, how to come up with internet site business ideas.<br />Although Ries  is a marketing guru, and not an internet techno-weenie, his understanding  of the internet runs deep, from a business point of view.<br />This is a  masterful book, and I recommend it highly.  I think a lot of VC firms  should have read it before they invested in many of the copy-cat web sites  that took their money.	2000-07-17

The author calls it &quot;extreme programming.&quot;<br />I  thought the book was easy to read yet contained very important topics.   Even if you don't agree with the author on releasing many small versions of  your software, you will find many useful ideas here.  At least I did.<br />I  don't fully agree with the author, but I can see several kinds of  situations where it applies (where specifications are unclear, for example,  which is often).  His approach would not be considered prototyping.  The  approach relies on many software builds, and the use of automated testing  to reduce risk and increase confidence in the software.<br />His comments on  options pricing models and software was excellent, but could have been  developed more.  I think this might have been confusing for non-financially  oriented readers.<br />I plan on using several of his recommended techniques.   The only weak point of the book, was that I didn't fully understand how to  implement the automated testing that he recommends.  This looks very  powerful, after he described the ramifications on the software cost curve.   I guess I'll have to learn this from another source.<br />I see that another  book is anticipated by the author in December of 2000.  I plan on getting  that book as well.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this book.<br />John Dunbar  Sugar Land, TX	2000-05-28

You should have a good bit of VB programming under your belt to appreciate the import of what he says.<br />He  also has a lot of recommended readings on each of the many topics.<br />He  praises and criticizes VB... in all the right places, in my opinion.   Although he criticizes VB 6 for bugs, I have found VB6 not to be so buggy.   But I also take a more conservative approach to using the newest  features.<br />The benefit of this book is that it will guide you in your use  of VB.  There are a few interesting code snippets.  But the purpose of this  book is not to get at the code, but to get the overall direction of when  and how to use VB to develop medium to large projects.<br />Another area where  he does great is in his coverage of database topics.  I really liked his  verbal descriptions of how to implement a homegrown pessimistic and  optimistic locking scheme.<br />I like VB, and I like this book.  I would put  it on the scale with McConnell's books in terms of general direction.  But  it is not like Bruce McKinney's book in terms of code and examples.<br />This  is a &quot;deep thinker's&quot; book.  In that you often have to stop and  think about his comments and how they apply to your use of VB.  For  example, should you move to ADO, should you use Triggers, what should your  coding style/standards be.<br />He also does an excellent job on the systems  analysis side of the equation.  I found myself agreeing with him about 80 %  of the time.  I'm more conservative when it comes to implementing COM, DCOM  and even basic objects.  His coverage of COM and DCOM was also terrific.

I can think of  no negatives on the book.  The authors consult on this subject as a  profession.  They present a plan for marketing your business that should be  fairly easy to follow.  <br />Most people will find that marketing ideas are  easy to find, but hard to implement... because most of us are too lazy or  too busy.  I think the marketing methods presented by these authors have  been selected because they are relatively (everything is relative) easy to  do.  <br />For example, they use a special form of postcards.  The postcards  are pre-printed with a certain kind of grahpical look (you'll have to read  the book to get the secret method).  Then you just take the postcard stock  down to the Jiffy Print and get this month's message printed on to them.   That means you only have to write a paragraph or two each time you mail  them out (recommended monthly).<br />All of their techniques have been  analyzed from this &quot;time saving&quot; point of view.  I think this  really adds value to the book -- as most of us don't have lots of  time.<br />If you go to their web site, you'll  find they have a seminar for financial planners.  I might sign up, if they  don't mind computer guys being there.<br />Any one with a personal business  should be able to translate the ideas presented here to their business  type.  I highly recommend this marketing book.  Another book on this  subject is the one by Tom Peters, andthat is harder to read given his  eclectic writing style.  But I'd still recommend Peter's book also.  They  come in a set of 3 related books.	2000-01-27

I think it ranks up there with Appleman's books.  But this book is different.  It is actually fun to read and yet at the same time it covers the important detail.  Somehow it makes the details  easy to read and fun.<br />This book does a GREAT job of going behind the  scenes in the Windows operating system.  There's lots of good information  about how Windows manages things and then how to work around this.<br />There  is an interesting and informed disussion of BSTR's.  The author reviews the  history of VB3's strings vs. VB4 and higher strings.  He also covers the  interesting aspects of overcoming VB's limitations of not having signed  numbers.  His discussion of two's complement storage was really  interesting.<br />Where Appleman is encyclopedic, this author goes into deep  detail but makes it interesting.  It is not one of those simple books with  the focus of &quot;here's how to make 500 API calls that might be  interesting.&quot;<br />This book is VB centric in that it explains the  differences between the VB world and the Win32/VC++ world.  Then you get  this great feeling of insight as to why VB does the things it does.<br />I  recommend this book highly, and also recommend the Appleman books.  They're  different kinds of animals.	1999-12-29

Don't expect to solve the  problems over night.<br />I think this author has done a great job at  assembling the techniques that work.  He also does a great job in analyzing  the psychology of the smart kid who just can't get good grades.  It's  amazing how many ways the child can say &quot;the dog ate my  homework.&quot;<br />He has a set of tapes and other material.  I have not  ordered that yet, but plan to.  I can not comment on those. <br />For the  cheap price of this book, you can not go wrong.<br />John D.	1999-12-24

I was very pleased about how the novel proceeds in action, plot and description.  Very well done here.<br />But I agree with others' assessment that there is little meat  on the bones.  I was sort of hoping for some &quot;how to&quot; or more  technical discussion of the techniques.  But still, if this subject  interests you, you will find the book fun to read.<br />Just don't read it as  a &quot;how to&quot; book.  It's just a very interesting novel in your  interest area.<br />Summary: Very interesting, but light weight &quot;gee  whiz&quot; novel on using the &quot;new math&quot; to beat the markets.  I  enjoyed it.<br />John	1999-12-24

The author starts off very laboriously trying to describe a cash-less, digital money system that the U.S. government implements.<br />After 3 or more  pondering chapters, the author then starts off on 14 or so... sub-plots...  that go absolutely NOWHERE.  You learn about a bunker in one chapter... and  alot of its detail.  Then you never see it again.<br />Then... there's NO  ENDING!<br />The book is really short.  Too short for all the sub-plots the  author got started.  You can read it quickly in one sitting.  <br />And last,  when the author describes details, it shows that he is not specific.  It's  a 7 mm Remington with a 3 to 9 power scope.  But you are not told what type  of scope, etc.  A gun guy would be disappointed.  This carries through to  many other objects being described.  <br />The only good points are the  illustrations of the corrupt politicians and governmental agencies.  The  author does a good job of how they take advantage of people in their own  command: double-crosses, threats, etc.<br />All in all, a great  disappointment.  There could be a great book on this subject, but this is  not it.  Compared to Cryptominicon (sp?) or Unintended Consequences this  book is a dud.<br />John	1999-12-13

Learning the art of living, with solar-dynamic, bio-benign design.&quot; Ok, the title sounds like something a hippy would come up with. But get  past the title... because the book is REALLY GREAT for the self-reliant who  want to create their own independent house.<br />This book is for the person  who wants to build an independent house in the boonies at low cost, and  wants practical low cost solutions.<br />It explains how to hook on a solar  garden to the house (or separately). How to use animals to provide heat...  and CO2 to grow your plants to new heights.<br />She's from Massachusetts, so  her winter solar home works through the cold winters. She's tested this  system over more than 10 years.<br />She explains how to grow salad materials  for profit. She shows you the numbers. But I'm not sure how applicable this  is to all markets. She's in the upscale area of Martha's Vineyard,  Massachusetts.<br />She explains how to create grey water and black water  waste systems that exceed common septic systems. An explanation on one of  the many color pictures says: &quot;The Solviva graywater garden: this  area, with its thriving roses, dogwood, pines, spruce and grasses has  recevied all graywater since my home was COMPLETED IN 1981. OVER THE PAST  17 YEARS these plants have successfully processed over 500 pounds of  regular detergents, shampoos and cleaners, and 45 gallons of chlorine  bleach.&quot;<br />On the toilets, she has invented a system that uses  standard flush toilets that feed a composting system. It's all low tech and  easy to build.<br />She uses grow tubes and growing beds in her greenhouses  (attached or separate).<br />She keeps chickens, rabbits, sheep, and one  donkey. All the systems feed each other. It's amazing how she relates the  various things on her property.<br />The amount of goodies she gets out of her  small farm(ette) are remarkable. <br />John D.	1999-11-15

The first half of the book covers the overall concepts and use of watchmaker's lathes.  The second half reviews all the models that might be typically found.  Not entirely encompassing  list... but pretty close.<br />If you are considering buying a watchmaker's  lathe... this is a MUST HAVE book.  Also, this is highly recommended for  any one who likes lathes in general.<br />It's obvious the author really cares  about his subject.  It is enjoyable to read.  The diagrams are excellent.<br />Crazy as this sounds, the photos are very good, but actually I thought  the line art of the machines (like you see in the Wall Street Journal) is  more understandable than regular photos.<br />Originally published in 1952, it  has been updated over the years in several editions.  This fifth edition in  1998 incorporates much of the original material... in the areas of general  concepts.  Then it substantially revises the second half of the book  regarding the lathes of the world that are generally found.<br />The book  lists lots of good resources in the back -- for manufacturers, etc.<br />John	1999-09-03

It is very appropriate for start ups -- as the costs of his techniques are  relatively low.<br />The author is a practical businessman.  And he's got  great testimonials from readers.  The one from E. Joseph Cossman follows:  &quot;Today I have over one-thousand business books in my library and if I  had to get rid of every one, the only one I would save would be Jeffrey's  book, &quot;UNcommon Marketing Techniques.&quot;<br />Again, it's a practical  book with low cost techniques for the budding entrepreneur.  They also can  be used by any business.  I particularly liked his coverage of multi-step  marketing and his coverage of what to do first on writing any sales letter  or ad (hint: something powerful about objectives).  <br />I also have his  other book &quot;How to Market a Product for under $500&quot; and recommend  it without hesitation.

The photography is stunning, and illustrates the  needed techniques very well.<br />I do not know of any other enamelling book  that has projects of this quality.  You would be proud to give these to  your friends and relatives.  By making simple adaptions you could create  your own designs.

It's a great book for someone considering a new house and is worried about security.<br />I just received mine and it is already 1/2 underlined.  It's 678 pages long, lots of new stuff compared to  his previous editions.  The size is a full 8 1/2 x 11 pages.  There's lots  of interesting design and construction ideas here.<br />For example, he  details his concepts of using gravel to bulletproof your walls.  Lots of  great stuff on basements, and tieing in to the foundation.  Great coverage  on water self-sufficiency.  Lots and lots of construction details.  Drawings nicely supplement the text.<br />He talks about remodeling as well  as new construction.  Lots of practical tips you can apply right away.  Here's a quick quote to illustrate how clearly written it is: &quot;Brick  and hollow block are only marginal shields for high powered projectiles.  But they are readily available and relatively affordable.  Both can be made  much stronger with re- bar and ladder wire in the voids.  Concreate block  is often reinforced with voids filled.  But few people know that brick can  also be reinforced...&quot;	1999-07-08

It focuses on the differences between &quot;big scale&quot; and &quot;small scale.&quot; <br />The author gives freely of his advice.  This is  not a specific how to each step of any machining operation, but an overall  how to.  You get lots of advice.  And, the book is stunning in it's  photo's.<br />The author gives you recommendations on which tools and  accessories to buy, and which vendors he buys from.  An example could be  the advice he gives on finishing off your part once it's machined.  He  advises the use of small polishing stones after the piece has been  deburred.  You'll see pictures of the stones he uses.  &quot;I have found a  1/4&quot; square shape the most useful.  The end can be shaped on a bench  grinder to get into tight spaces.  The stone is dipped into kerosene  frequently to keep the surface being cut awash with fluid...&quot;  This  goes on for about 4 large paragraphs.<br />Then he tells you about finishing  off with sandpapers.  &quot;I have gotten excellent results with 320A wet  and dry sandpaper glued ot small sticks.  I buy these woooden sticks at  hobby shops and prefer spruce.  I glue the sticks to the paper with instant  &quot;super glue&quot; and make up a batch of them at one time...&quot;  He  goes on for several more paragraphs on sandpapers.  They he talks about  powdered and liquified abrasive polishes, then tumbled finishes.  Well, you  get the idea.<br />The last chapter of the book describes how the author  started his business and relays all the important lessons that he learned.   This chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  In fact, you should  read what he says about the great value of their internet site.<br />Again,  this book is geared to the smaller scale of desktop machining... not using  the big iron.  He notes the differences.  His comments on CNC, and on  craftsmanship, CAD and engineering are also very interesting.<br />Although  all the examples in the book used the company's Sherline lathes, mills and  accessories, it was not blatent, nor came across as self-serving.<br />It's a  big format book, paper back, with glossy paper with full color photos on  just about every page.<br />I highly recommend this book.  And, my hats off to  the author for doing such a remarkable and detailed job.<br />John Dunbar	1999-06-14

Paid for itself several times over	This is a great book on Bug Proofing your code.  Very easy to read.  Lots of useful tips in every chapter.  Well organized... and contains ALOT of code examples.<br />If you're an advanced VB programmer (already have made  many mistakes and have taken up defensive programming), this book could be  reduced to 1/3 the size... and it would still be a great book.<br />I'll use  code from this book.  I particularly liked the discussion on how you could  set a form (object) to Nothing and later in your code you reference a  public variable in that form (and unbeknownst to you it loads again).  This  keeps the form loaded when you think it's not.  He shows coded examples of  this sequence.<br />After reading this book, I'm going to get his other VB  Graphics book.  He's a very good author.<br />One thing I wished he had  covered was Error handling when using Access database routines  (non-databound).  I like to use subroutines that update separate tables,  and I like to use .BeginTrans, etc. with the .Update method for the opened  database.  This allows me to simply use SQL statements.<br />In this case, I  was looking for example code, or recommended logic for using multiple  subroutines.  Although he didn't specifically provide this, he did provide  alot of ideas on how to control the Error calling sequence using the .Raise  method.  Thanks to his book I understand this process better and hope to  solve this problem directly.<br />For the beginning programmer this is an  excellent book for establishing your programming standards.  You will make  a great step forward in programming... although you may only understand 80  % of this book.<br />This should be in every VB programmers bookshelf.<br />John  D.	1999-02-04

This is a great book about the history (and use of) numbers.  What really stands out are the graphics.  This is a full color book with lots and lots of historic documents, pictures, paintings, etc... revolving around numbers.  Very interesting coverage of Mayan use of numbers.  For example he shows all the various forms of the Mayan zero.<br />I've unfortunately ruined my copy of this book by underlining in it so heavily.  Here's some sample copy:<br />&quot;To India goes the credit for inventing the complete zero, with all the three functions of place notation, designation of quantity, and number.  It first appears in manucscripts of the 5th century AD....&quot; The author covers this topic of zero in about 2 pages of text... then goes on to show several beautiful pictures of the use of zero.<br />A following page covers infinity and it includes a full color picture of Plato debating Aristotle (Raphael fresco).<br />Did you know that the first zero was written in Babylon (before the 3rd century BC)?  But, unfortunately they didn't use zero as a number itself... only as an unused digit. The Mayans sometime in the first 1000 years also developed a limited form of zero.<br />This is a most delightful book.  I've used it to show children the beauty of numbers (oh... look at the abacus...).  I've also learned more about our &quot;numeric heritage&quot; from this author.  He's a professor of the history of science at Univ. of Paris. He's written other books along this line.<br />The book is one of a series called &quot;Discovery&quot; titles by Harry N. Abrams, Inc.  I've not read any of the other titles.  But by judging from their back flap listing... they probably are small, full color books having a low price with a scientific or historical bend.<br />This book is small enough to fit in your pants pocket if you force it (5&quot; x 7&quot; x 1/2&quot;).  This 175 page full color book is just the right size for lunch time reading.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the mathematically curious.<br />John Dunbar	1998-10-11

Maybe that's why the publisher's name is  &quot;Cottage Life Books.&quot;<br />This is a very informative and easy to  read book... particularly given the unusually narrow focus of this  book.<br />If you are about to build a cottage out in the woods (maybe for  Y2K)... then this is the very first book you should read to understand how  to obtain a water supply and how to handle the sewage/septic systems. The  explanations could not be clearer.<br />The author even shows you several  beautiful designs for outhouses. He also discusses and illustrates such  alternative toilets as: electric, self-contained composting toilets.<br />His  clear diagrams show how leaching systems work. Same with pumping water in  from lakes or up from wells.<br />This is an EXCELLENT book... and if you are  interested in the subject matter, I would rate it a MUST READ.<br />The author  is Canadian, I believe... and he refers to the bathrooms as  &quot;loos&quot;. I would imagine they would say... &quot;Hey Joe... Let's  pull over so I can hit the loo.&quot;<br />Here's a sample discussing water  quality:<br />&quot;...The nutrients of primary concern to cottagers are  phosphorus, because of its effect on aquatic life in our waterways, and  nitrogen, because of its potential health effect on humans. They also tend  to travel together.<br />Most fresh-water ecosystems, like lakes, are  phosphorus limited in their natural state, meaning that phosphorus is in  relatively short supply in that system. So aquatic plant life is also  limited. But as phosphorus is introduced into the water - the process being  greatly accelerated by faulty septic and municipal sewages sytesm,  continued use of phosphate-based soaps... (and he goes on to discuss  blue-green algae)...<br />Other than affecting taste, phosphorus doesn't  directly degrade the quality of water for drinking purposes. Nitrogen,  however , is another matter. High levels of nitrates have been linked to  methaemoglobinemia, a disease causing oxygen deficiencies in blood... (and  he continues on about the negative side of nitrogen)...&quot;<br />OK, this  was just a short passage on the nutrients and contamination of water  supplies that would affect a cottager. He spends most of his time  discussing the practical/how to side of getting your water supply ready.  But without the ability to show the beautiful illustrations, you would not  appreciate the clarity of his explanations.<br />Again, I think it is a great  read, and good luck on your cottage water system.<br />John   [...]	1998-08-26

Us  Humans... we ruined nature.  Then he retreats to the position that the  world was pure before World War II.  This book makes good reading for Al  Gore wanna-bees.  It contains nothing of practical value.  I couldn't make  it through the first chapter.  I wanted to read about how someone built  their retreat in the woods... but only received large spoonfuls of  propaganda against humankind.  On the bright side, the cover is pretty.	1998-08-23

He is particularly great in this book when he talks about business-to-business marketing.  He covers how to make &quot;offers&quot; in your copy...  particularly the tried-and-true &quot;Free Booklet&quot; offer.  You will become an expert in these after reading this book.  I also very much liked the section on marketing via seminars... and even marketing on the internet.  I didn't bother reading the telemarketing chapter as I have his telemarketing book that was recently published.  I recommend you pass on the telemarketing book... but DEFINITELy get this book.  I have heavily underlined my copy.  Here's a quick quote from his book on audio cassettes: &quot;Audiocassettes are the easiest and least costly audiovisual medium to use as information bait pieces.  Some marketers using audiocassettes think that briefer is better and limit the message to 10 or 20 minutes.  But if the tape contains pure, useful information, it can be much longer.  I have been successful promoting both my seminars and my consulting and copywriting services using cassettes on marketing and sales topics that are 30 to 90 minutes long.&quot; He goes on to point out that cassettes can be used to promote (sample) seminars at less than $1.50 per cassette.  OK, there's lots of good stuff here.  Well worth the $60.  Bly is greatest in the printed mediums... but also understands how to integrate the other mediums quite well.  He's just not an expert on telemarketing. Again, this book is rated a &quot;MUST BUY.&quot; He is the master of the &quot;Send for Free Booklet&quot; offer... and that's what sales leads are all about.
