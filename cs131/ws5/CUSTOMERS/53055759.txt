He attempts here to clue readers in on how to tell the difference between good and bad advice. He warns against embracing any &quot;Wow!&quot; type advice from top-selling gurus. Too often with this type of stuff, Argyris argues, managers use external advice rather than base their management on getting a read of the internal commitment of employees. As a result, managers lose credibility. Argyris takes on big-name gurus like Stephen Covey and calls into question the true validity of his work by showing the flaws in Covey's thinking. He uses the example that Covey uses of not telling his son how he truly feels when he wants to get him to do something because he knows his sons knows. Argyris looks at this theory of Covey that trust brings out the best in people and points that that while it may be &quot;morally attractive,&quot; t's just not clear how &quot;a combination of trust and mistrust, accompanied by cover-ups, will bring out the best in people.&quot;  One of the take-aways from this book is the need to continually test and challenge management approaches and not to rest of what's successful, since success, Argyris writes &quot;can breed conservatism which in a fast-changing, competitive environment can cause failure.&quot;	2001-01-12

The premise underlying Malcolm Gladwell's argument in The Tipping Point is that to understand why some products and ideas take off, we have to think of them like viruses:  &quot;Ideas and products and messages and behaviors,&quot; he writes, &quot;spread just like viruses do.&quot; He uses the example of how Hush Puppies shoes that were only selling about 30,000 pairs of shoes a year, started being thought of as hip rather than pass. By 1995 the word had spread like a virus and, 430,000 pairs of Hush Puppies were sold. In 1996, about four times that number were sold. It's like measles spreading, Gladwell argues. It involves contagiousness, recognizing tha tlittle causes have large effects, and understanding how change often occurs at one dramatic moment rather than gradually. That one dramatic moment is what Gladwell calls &quot;the tipping point.&quot; By reading Gladwell's book you can get a sense of how some smart companies understand this and take advantage of it to spread their own virus.	2001-01-11

That explains why people know how to play tapes in their VCRs but can't set the clock on the thing. The first is a social action; the second isn't. For products to succeed it helps to get them out into society. The authors cite the example of Alexander Graham Bell who decided after his investors stopped supporting him that he should &quot;abandon specialists and ... put phones in people's hands.&quot; So he got his phones installed in hotels and offices and near luncheon counters. That way, the authors write, &quot;people who didn't know how to use them would be likely to see people who did know how and in this way learn about the phone system.&quot; It's getting products into the hands of society that gives them life, and the authors make a compelling case for why this is so and how it's worked time and again in successful companies.	2001-01-11

(Trout acknowledges this and dedicates the book to Reeves.) Trout's book essentially is Reeve's Trout's thesis is basically Reeves's but with new examples. That makes for not a lot of startling revelations here. In short chapters, Trout distinguishes differentiating factors (such as being first, leadership, market specialty) from stuff that falls outside of such factors, like creativity, price, and quality. Trout makes the argument that fast growth can be a wicked distraction and get in the way of successful differentiation. But while he trots out some examples of this (ESPN's rollout of other cable offerings, for example), there's nothing here that makes a compelling case about why fast growth and differentiation can't go hand in hand. Fast growth can be a distraction from any aspect in business; the trick is to figure out how to manage it. That's not something that you'll get here.	2001-01-09

What's happened as a result is that &quot;middle-class wealth is no longer an oxymoron,&quot; write the authors, so people now &quot;see their work lives not as jobs, but as a series of risk management choices.&quot;  But they go on: &quot;Of course, the bull market's end will affect these attitudes -- at least temporarily.&quot; What we don't know from the book is what will happen to this middle-class wealth in a market downturn. Granted, the authors see the book, however, as part of an ongoing discussion with readers, and it is a provocative one. Still, don't look here for any solutions to the issues of those who aren't beneficiaries of this newfound wealth. The authors argue that the super-rich are irrelevant and they write: &quot;The disparity between the top and the bottom 10% may distract you from the 80% in the middle,&quot; they write. Well, that might be true, but for some those at the bottom of the bottom 10% who are living below the poverty line cry out for attention, at least in the minds of some.

Sadly, he observes these cards are &quot;ignored and things go on as before.&quot; The premise underlying this book is that Quinn would have us care enough to change this way of thinking. The key, he says, is to stop doing things out of self-interest and start identifying and going after the shared goals of the group. He does a nice job of working good examples into his text. He also points out how risky it is to be a true leader since it involves overcoming a fear of failure when trying something new. He also does a nice job of making clear that hierarchy in itself is not a bad thing; it's only bad when they're perceived as mechanisms that result in getting nothing done. &quot;Hierarchies become frozen bureaucracies due to the failure of human courage.&quot; He makes a compelling case for why it's crucial to skip the hollow words and dare to lead toward change.

He refers to this stuff as 'numeracy,' and he writes clearly on how you need to understand these numbers to get a clear sense of your company's health. He also advocates that CEOs take regularly scheduled snapshots of these companies by updating cash-flow statements, performing cost analysis on products, and doing break-even analyses for the company and all products. A firm understanding of these numbers limits the number of surprises that can wreak havoc on the company. &quot;Tinkering at the margins is what most businesses are really about,&quot; Reiss writes. It's not a matter of coming up with anything remarkably new, but borrowing other's time-tested ideas, improving on them a bit and then executing. Clear stuff from someone with experience.	2001-01-06

Along the way, we see the partners make what in retrospect was a prescient multimillion dollar investment in eBay, pass on Jay Walker's priceline, dismiss Jerry Kaplan's Onsale (competitor to eBay), but pour money into online grocery site Webvan. What does this tell us? Well, given the current state of affairs, it partly tells us that in the Internet economy (are we still calling it that?), even a book as recent as Stross's gets dated fast. But what Stross would also have us believe is that the Benchmark eBoys were of a different breed than most (please don't call us) VC firms. They decided early on they'd all be equal partners which I guess we're to take as a sign of internal nobility. They also decide early on that they'll price themselves as aggressively as possible as VC players which I guess we're to take as a sign of their confidence. At its best, the book does give a glimpse into behind the scenes deal making stuff. But be prepared for an unbridled enthusiasm for the goodness of these guys. Clearly they're pained as the good guys in a world littered with not so good guys. At times this reads like the author might have gotten a little too close to his subject and bought their spiel.

If you do this, she maintains, you stand a better chance of success. While some of the stories Hammer tells of her treatment among the executive ranks are pretty horrendous, they come off as a forthright take on what it's like in the trenches. In fact such details add to the overall value of the book. We read of the boss who humiliated her in front of her colleagues by forming a shadow committee to duplicate her efforts behind her back and then announcing the adoption of that committee's suggestions at a department-wide meeting. She tells of an employee she was mentoring who eventually tried to take over her job. Understanding the enemy, Hammer says, is the way to win in the workplace wars.<br />Unlike other CEO books that make the journey seem all too pat, Hammer does a good job of painting a more complete picture, warts and all. The end result is a useful book for anyone working at a company or trying to make it with his or her own company.	2001-01-03

The argument is that any move toward environmentalism is a good bet, basing this on the same concept used by 17th century philospher Blaise Pascal who wagered: &quot;If God does not exist, one will lose nothing by believing in him, while if he does exist, one will lose everything by not believing.&quot; There's a particularly telling anecdote in the book involving Edgar Woolard, the former chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., after he pronounced the business's commitment to zero pollution. Subsequent to the pronouncement an engineer told Woolard that there wasn't any way one of the plants could meet the new goal. So Woolard tells the engineer that the plant will have to close. Ironically, after the plant's engineers do come up with a solution, it turns out that it will ultimately save du Pont money. This book is a terrific exploration of how some businesses are discovering that environmentalism is not only a must for survival of society, but also for the future of business. Good, well analyzed stories and thinking here.	2000-12-31

Knight, The Essential Aldo Leopold: Quotations and Commentaries is not, strictly speaking, a business book, but contained here in many previously unpublished observations are the thoughts and ideas of a natural (in all senses of the word) manager.

An economist's traditional tools don't take into account such stuff as soil, forests, garbage, and produce. Only when they do, will the affect of environmentalism be understood. Good book, well argued.	2000-12-31

The tie to the shriveling of bowling leagues gave him hisclever title. The article made the rounds and created quite a buzz inpublic policy circle. His take is that while business has replacedcommunity as the primary place where people have their socialconnections, few of the friendships formed in the workplace achievethe same level of intimacy as friendships in the neighborhood orcommunity had in the past.  The problem is exacerbated when you addthe growth of the cotingent workforce that results in high transiencein the workplace. Intimacy is down and so too is loyalty to thebusiness. The end result of all of this is increasing isolation whichin the workplace can have a major adverse impact on productivity aswell as loyalty. The book is provocative, full of deep research, and agood starting point for a discussion on the state of individuals insociety.	2000-12-31

(Ohmae, in THE INVISIBLE CONTINENT, might argue that being second -- take, for example, VHS over Betamax in a pre-internet market -- doesn't always spell defeat.) What the authors do do well here is to stress the importance of branding on the Internet. It's a message Al Ries has been writing on for some time, so the elevation of the issue here is no surprise. The authors in this book stress the importance of deciding whether your business's internet presence is mainly for distribution or if you plan to operate the business full-hog online. If the latter, you need to start from ground zero, the authors argue, and think about changing such things as your name to gain brand awareness. But little advice here on how to decide on an appropriate name. The broad ideas are here, but the specifics aren't...although I'm not sure the authors intended this so much as a step-by-step how-to book as one in which they laid down broad laws.	2000-12-30

The authors base their advice on the research they did into what they call 'business webs' which consist of a network of producers, service providers, suppliers, infrastructure companies, and customers that are all networked together through use of various digital channels. The authors find that there are five types of business webs, give examples for each of these, and give readers enough information that they might be able to model their own online business strategies on them.	2000-12-30

Interesting history of the Linux operating system, its early days, its evolution, and how through sharing files and offering the system for free, Linux began to take away market share from more pricey alternatives. Included here too is the growth of the reseller and repackager market for Linux programs. Offers an interesting peak into the world of a band of programmers who may never see any cash from their pioneering efforts, but may take heart in knowing that their efforts produced a system on a shoestring that is preferred to more well-known, entrenched operating systems on the market.	2000-12-30

And Komisar does do a nice job of articulating what he thinks is important for a business start-up to succeed. A lot of it has to do with recognizing the difference between passion and drive. Passion for a business is far more valuable an indicator of potential success to Komisar's mind and we spend the pages of this short book hearing his advice to his grasshopper...er, student entrepreneur. While the book is a good, easy read, I couldn't help but feel that the author comes off as a bit of a smug know-it-all who finally gets the sadsack of a mentee over to his way of thinking, the right true way, of course. All this is easy enough when you're telling the story and protecting the identities of the ones who need to be coached into coming around. Not sure if there's much here to help those who want a real-world view of what it's really like to make their way as a startup in search of capital, especially as the markets for capital get tighter. Still, business readers seem to love parables and pearls and there are plenty of those tossed in here.	2000-12-30

He highlights his take on what these companies do right and where they appear to fall short. But this isn't the type of book you'd be able to use as a guide to taking your own business online. There's not a lot here that's readily transferable to other businesses wanting to go online or to improve their current offerings. Still, as a snapshot in time, it makes for an interesting read.	2000-12-30

Companies that don't heed the cry of consumers will falter, he argues. He makes his case in an articulate examination of how consumers define the accepted &quot;platforms,&quot; regardless of whether they are necessarily the best in the market(such as VHS's dominance over Betamax).	2000-12-29

He uses his book to show how some company market caps can be justified based. Interesting to know what he thinks now that the dot-com world is descending back down to earth.	2000-12-29

(See Mackay's EXTRAORDINARY DELUSIONS for an excellent early recounting of the tulip and other crazes.) Kennedy's book looks not just at the Internet stock run-up but also the P/E values of other companies, such as GE, which he argues are also over-valued based on their earnings. His picture painted is a bleak one and his question of whether the leaders of the dot-com movement such as amazon.com will ever have enough margins to boast any profits are especially prescient given the dot-com downturn that followed the publication of his book.  (See Geoffrey Moore's LIVING ON THE FAULT LINE for an opposing view of shareholder value.)	2000-12-29
