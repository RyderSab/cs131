As a kid I thought their little plots were merely amusing, but after getting out into the world and encountering the sorts of folks who make their living by ripping other people off, I could understand how any citizens of that era would have had no qualms whatever about dipping such a duo in hot tar and then feathers.  The young American West must have been rife with such con artists, and their ilk was marvelously presented in \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"<br /><br />And as for the word we're not allowed to say, it's amazing that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is banned in many places for its literary use of that word in a serious work of social satire/commentary -- while a film like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" with its own liberal use of that word, and no serious purpose beyond entertainment via plot and violence, is roundly praised.  Odd indeed.	2005-10-12

If \\"Freddy\\" is the first time you've encountered his style, you'll likely consider this book absolutely terrific. <br /> <br />If you've steeped yourself in Mark Helprin's previous work, though, including his magnificent Wall Street Journal commentaries across the past several years, you'll likely experience a twinge of... let us call it... \\"recognitional disappointment.\\"  Too many of Mr. Helprin's literary Laurel-and-Hardy-type comedic situations in \\"Freddy\\" seem a tiny trifle formulaic, for a reader familiar with his other novels.  The humor in \\"Freddy,\\" compared to a first-time reading of the (intended-to-be-misunderstood) hilarity in \\"Memoir From Antproof Case,\\" conveys a slight staleness of spontaneity. <br /> <br />There is a risk in offering anything but praise for Mark Helprin's work, because someone can always point a finger at you and say, \\"Well, chump, how does \\"Freddy and Fredericka\\" stack up against any books that YOU have written?  Well, chump?\\"  At the same time, it's fair for an avid fan -- and one whose literary talents are pretty much limited to mere reading, rather than composition -- to expect something new and fresh each time Mark Helprin wields his fantastic pen.  \\"Freddy\\" was a good effort, but it did not exhibit the progression we have observed across the catalogue of \\"Refiner's Fire\\" to \\"Winter's Tale\\" to \\"Soldier of the Great War\\" to \\"Memoir From Antproof Case.\\"  \\"Freddy\\" is a pause upon a plateau.    <br /> <br />I sincerly hope Mark Helprin's next major work will be non-fiction, and will consist of his appraisal of the current state of the world.  I don't want a reprint of his Wall Street Journal material, but I do want to encounter the same sort of contemporary immediacy (and wonderful language), in his thoughts about the path our American life now is taking... and what he hopes will happen next.  Mark Helprin is an American literary treasure, and we can only look forward with content anticipation to his next endeavor.	2005-08-26

And as things turned out, the true living in which they bothered to engage got fouled up beyond belief.  I have never encountered a situation not involving crime/violence that was as much of a pluperfect MESS as Ayn Rand and Nathan Branden (abetted by their spouses) made of their lives.   <br /> <br />It it, however, a fascinating tale, if you only lightly skim the occasional bouts of psycho-babble in which Branden engages.  I speak not with disdain or ridicule, for I buy into objectivism about 96 percent -- it's not at though, like many others, I denounce objectivism due to the personal problems Ayn Rand caused herself.  Her work was marvelous, and it generated thinking that completely changed (upgraded) my view of the world -- but Good Grief, she certainly did botch her personal life, and she dragged young Nathan (and his wife, and her husband Frank) right down into the mud with her. <br /> <br />Nathan spoke with odd affection for a softball game the Collective played one time, how they simply played baseball for awhile and avoided philosophy completely.  They should have engaged in such activities more frequently, they should have gotten out more... and really enjoyed life (in addition to getting some much-needed physical exercise).	2005-08-22

Asked to tell his story, Bill began by saying that the film \\"The Longest Day,\\" simply \\"did not show enough Americans dropping dead on that beach.\\"  He then told how he was the driver of a vehicle with a double-barrelled anti-aircraft gun mounted on the back, and that his unit has been ordered to participate in the assault.  They arrived on the beach to find heavy resistance, unbelievably loud noise and horrible destruction.  Bill said that, for his weapons to be used against the Nazi emplacements, he had to back the vehicle onto the beach.  A weapons crewman used their AA gun, its muzzles lowered, to blast the gun portals in the concrete blockhouse.  (Bill died of natural causes in 1990.)   <br /> <br />I had not thought about Bill's tale for many years.  Reading Stephen Ambrose's \\"D Day:  June 6, 1944\\" this week, I came to an account that slowly stunned me into recognition -- the narrator, an officer, was telling EXACTLY the same story Bill had told us, 20 years ago.  A sentence or two later, the officer mentioned his driver, \\"Bill X,\\" and a chill shuddered down my back -- it was like a ghost had walked into the room. <br /> <br />That established author Ambrose's credibility for me, insofar as the story of D-Day goes.  Readers can argue that he favored the American view or whatever, but the stories from the guys who parachuted, crawled or rode into Normandy that day indeed ring with a realism that nobody can deny.	2005-06-23

One has to feel amazed, reading this book, at how PROUD the people of Massachusetts must be of their esteemed senior US senator.  First, he was eminently generous to host a party for six young women who had all toiled so hard to assist with his family's politics.  You have to know that lower-level campaign workers of their age rarely receive attention from the more powerful folks in the political apparatus.  The girls must have been utterly thrilled, to have been asked to a cook-out and get to mingle with all of those seasoned, powerful men.  Edward Kennedy was extremely magnanimous, stooping in that fashion to reward the \\"little people.\\"<br /><br />Also, the kindness he extended to Ms Kopechne, in offering to drive her back to the mainland after she began feeling tired, was just stupendous.  For a busy, powerful man of this nature to offer such a favor to an attractive young woman is simply heart-warming -- it's just not the sort of thing that your typical rich, connected and powerful male will do for a pretty young girl.<br /><br />And then:  Tragedy, a horrible, ghastly accident wherein the senator, unfamiliar with the route, drove his car off a bridge.  It could have happened to anyone.  But then he redeemed himself in the eyes of his family, of her family, his constituency (the citizens of Massachusetts), and the Almighty, by exerting a superhumanly heroic effort to save her from drowning in the car.  Diving repeatedly into the dangerously swift current, heedless of his own life and limb -- what a man! -- he just could not extract her from that watery tomb.<br /><br />But the senator then did not let anyone down.  He immediately assumed full and complete responsibility, proactively contacting authorities and providing a comprehensive, extremely detailed account of the tragedy that answered all possible questions and completely cleared the air.  He made his Massachusetts supporters very, very proud of him, and they immediately decided he can be their senator forthe rest of his life.<br /><br />Suffering terrible pain (causing him to need a neck brace), the senator then attended the girl's funeral and comforted her parents -- a godlike gesture from a godlike politician.  Edward Kennedy, ambassador of goodness, healer of wounds, dryer of tears, comforter of parents whose daughter gets accidentally drowned and just happens, as fate would have it, not to be clad in any below-the-waist undergarments at the time that older, married man was driving her home.<br /><br />We all should salute the voters of Massachusetts for their superb choice in senators.  If we considered the people of Massachusetts a sort of \\"holy spirit,\\" then we may rightfully call that state's two divine senators the \\"father\\" and the \\"son.\\"  World without end, Amen.	2004-11-29

My favorites are the recovered memories, satanic ritual abuse and alien abductions, all of which appear to result from someone wanting a little ordinary, good old attention.  Oh man, I have deceased relatives from rural Central Texas who would have THRIVED on these sorts of things, if only they'd every known or thought about them.  I was surprised, though, that the author did not mention the radiation hysteria of the late 1940s and 1950s, the early days of the atomic age when everyone was hunting everywhere for uranium -- like that incident wherein an entire film factory was torn down because the owners were CONVINCED that radioactivity was clouding one particular type of their film (and not a light leak).   <br /> <br />I can see where some folks, such as Gulf War vets and chronically tired workers, would take umbrage at the suggestion their maladies are not genuine -- but that's for the reader to decide.

This first volume of Robert Caro's award-winning series is absolutely fascinating, a riveting study of a supernaturally insecure and self-interested, manipulative unprincipled pragmatist.  Being from Central Texas, as I child my only knowledge of LBJ involved the fact that my grandparents (from north of the Hill Country) worshipped him.  I could see that LBJ talked like us, and wore boots like my relatives, but that was about it.  Caro's account of Lyndon's self-promotional antics was unbelievably illuminating -- I immediately could see why so many (and many of them uneducated) folks adored him, and Caro reveals all that was happening behind the scenes.  Lyndon's capacity to push himself forward and upward was often nauseating, and it's no wonder he had few true friends because contemporaries could always see beneath his manipulations.  However, in adulthood he left all of his contemporaries behind with his patronage of the powerful and dominance of the powerless.  The manner in which he treated those around him, those who worked for him, is eye-opening -- he subjugated them completely, demanding total loyalty regardless of his behavior toward them.  He treat his own wife like dirt, ordering her around like a servant while conducting an affair practically in her presence.  Commentator Molly Ivins, being a yellow-dog member of LBJ's own political party, complained that Caro did not treat Lyndon kindly in this book -- which is simply another way of saying that Caro was extremely honest, open, blunt and fascinating in this fine book.  This may be the best biography you ever read (with or without adding the other volumes of the series).	2004-04-22

He whipped them into shape and instilled discipline, creating an efficient unit that went forward into parachute training then combat.  (Sobel had been so harsh with the men, they were in better physical condition than the instructors at jump school.)  As training developed, Sobel stressed night operations to the point some of the men joked they could function better in the dark than in daylight.<br />It's too bad the battalion leadership didn't become aware that Sobel was a problem until after his noncommissioned officers nearly mutinied.  Sobel turned out to be incompetent at field problems, in addition to continuing his chicken ways (which are appropriate for initial training, but not for further development).  If someone had recognized that Sobel was superb at molding totally untrained men into soldiers, and would have best served the Army solely in that capacity, the man could have been utilized throughout the war for basic paratroop training.  As it was, he went forward with Easy Company and his incompetence propagated relegation to humiliating supply-officer duties.<br />And just when you think this guy's life couldn't have gotten any more pitiful (having to salute, for instance, superior officers who had once been subordinate in rank to him), you reach the &quot;Where They Are Now&quot; chapter -- and you really feel sorry for this fellow.  It was appropriate that Ambrose recognized Sobel's contribution to the excellence of Easy Company, but (good grief!) the sad man's ultimate outcome in life was just pitiful.<br />If Sobel's career had been confined to basic training, he would have been considered a great soldier by everyone whom he trained.  As it was, he was terrific to a point, and then everything disintegrated.  An extremely interesting, gripping story -- Enjoy.	2004-03-30

For you snuff fans, Man of Nazareth is every bit as gory as Melvin's film, going into painful detail about the Roman method of execution in those days.  And, its flashbacks are more powerful and thoughtful, for those seeking expansion of the biblical accounts.<br />Problem is, this is a mere book -- it's not a Melvin Gibson movie.  That's why it won't achieve anything near the circulation this new film will enjoy.  More's the pity.	2004-03-14

It delves into several war campaign details, reporting a surprising amount of information about the Germans' war against Russia.  It contains many eyewitness recounts of conversations with Hitler, explaining his thinking as the war in the East progressed -- and then failed to progress.  All of this background, which portended the ultimate destruction of Germany, gave rise to the various schemes to kill Hitler. The only real shame in the entire scenario is that none of the conspirators was willing to simply walk up to the dictator and ignite a bomb.  Most lost their lives anyway, after several failed attempts to rid the world of a monster.	2004-02-16

Possessing little, and coming from a disadvantaged background to which Mr. Franken sometimes refers, he has through creativity and energy tapped into a lucrative reader market and vaulted into the thin ranks of best-selling authors.  His work -- his lonely work as a creative writer, his initiative as a commentator -- has produced for him a fortune, and he may now proudly consider himself a successful rich American.  His toil has made him wealthy beyond the dreams of most of us, and rightfully so -- Mr. Franken fully deserves every penny of the funds that people have paid voluntarily for access to his humor and commentary.  Mr. Franken never begged, or complained to the government or demanded any sort of subsidy or bail-out -- rather, he got to work, found a market for his abilities, took charge of his own life, became self-reliant, and grew very wealthy.  Everyone in our nation should emulate this concept, and do as Mr. Franken did:  Get to work for yourself, produce something legal/honorable that other people like, and reap the profits therefrom.  Congratulations, Mr. Franken:  It is the motivated individuals like YOU who prove that American-style, free-market, profit-seeking, laissez-faire capitalism is the greatest economic system ever devised by humans.  While Al Franken doesn't preach it, he definitely LIVES it.	2004-02-09

Dismissed as angry ranting by a fawning Texas public when first published, this little book outlines broadly the subject areas later explored in detail by Robert Caro in his superlative &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot; series.  This brief paperback does not read smoothly -- and it helps a great deal to have read Caro's books before reading it -- but you will see that at least one person was fully onto Lyndon Johnson's supernatural self-interest and pragmatic willingness to do whatever was necessary for advancing Lyndon Johnson.  My grandparents worshipped Lyndon -- and showing this book to them, when it first came out, was like tossing holy water on a demon.  They did not want to have ANYTHING to do with it.

The &quot;old women&quot; and &quot;the girls&quot; cohorts of victims propagated subconscious disconnections between factors being treated as the work of a single perpetrator, as did the case's sudden wrap-up.  The psychoanalysis sessions, looking back at them, appeared laced with manipulation, and subsequent examinations of the Strangler case substantiate that:  DeSalvo was prompted to be the killer, because they needed a killer to blame.  <br />Still, the portions about the investigation before DeSalvo's appearance are fascinating -- the crime scene descriptions, the victim timetables, detectives and their occasional dead ends.  The tale is quite interesting, but should be absorbed only in combination with other writings about the Strangler case(s).  It only makes you wish they had had, in the early 1960s, the same forensic techniques we have today.  They really might have caught the guy(s).	2004-01-14

This is the sort who can be absolutely charming in front of a group, then alter into an arrogant, self-centered and total jerk when one-on-one behind closed doors.  My favorite experience with this type involved meeting with one about some extremely sensitive company matters, hunched over a desk together for nearly an hour.  That same afternoon, I passed him in a hallway and said &quot;Hello,&quot; and he just walked past as if I were empty air, ignoring me completely.  Jerk.<br />The next piece of slime from the bottom of this septic tank is the Wheeler-Dealer Weasel, the adroit CFO who, if he would dedicate to legitimate business pursuits mere FRACTION of the energy and thought he applies to concocting shifty schemes and tricks, would be globally admired.  This sort is the greedy self-promoter who always has some sort of angle going, primarily aimed at cutting himself in for a piece of the action.  <br />Another component in this excrement mosaic is the Weasel's Little Lackey, the slightly-lower-level accounting type who acts as front man for the Wheeler-Dealer's indecipherable schemes.  <br />These four dudes from Enron deserve hard time, they deserve a couple of decades in the pen, they deserve to be poor as church mice for the rest of their lives, begging their mere subsistence with no chance of ever again owning as much as $100 all at once -- they deserve to be squalid paupers for the duration of their miserable worthless little lives.<br />Others involved, whom we must thank, are the investment bankers and the CPA who inhaled all the smoke these four were blowing.  The accounting firm that lost its license fully deserved to do so -- they were drunk and blinded by large fees from Enron, and were not NEARLY confrontational enough.  I don't know if the head auditor on the account deserves jail -- I don't know if he was criminal, but he was definitely incompetent, completely failing in the vital outside-auditor attest function, simply polishing every apple the Enron criminals handed to him.  <br />This appraisal sounds appalled and bitter.  You can only IMAGINE how it would have been phrased, if I had been one of the many unfortunate souls who lost everything due to the criminal actions of these four corporate low-lifes and their banker/CPA co-conspirators.  Let's hope those four end up completely impoverished, as soon as possible.	2003-11-24

Moore himself was down-and-out in the great crash of the US auto industry, finding his home town in monetary ruins thanks to GM's fold-up.   What did Moore do?  He acted upon an idea, and made a fine satirical documentary film wherein he attempted to pin down GM's CEO for some answers (along with several amusing sidelines).  The film was successful, critically and financially, and opened the door to a new career for Moore, including the interesting series, TV Nation, some books and an Oscar-winning film.<br />Michael Moore has aggressively pursued the free-market capitalist's dream, creating for himself an individual wealth-producing machine more potent than any he might ever have operated on a GM assembly line.  He is making a lot money for himself, and he has become quite wealthy.  He is a rich man now, up from nothing.  How can he possibly conclude that success of this sort cannot be achieved by anyone else?  Isn't he living the American dream?	2003-10-20

When faced with a terrorist threat from Germany, Chamberlain's very first thought was, \\"Why does he hate us?\\"  Chamberlain then based his every succeeding action upon the premise there must have been something wrong with his own society and way of life, and he went out of his way to appease the terrorist, to give him more time, to allow inspectors to do their jobs and so forth.  Contrasted with all the savages who suggest that the German terrorist should have been killed early in the game, Chamberlain's exemplary diplomatic behavior (consulting others, forming a coalition to sit and observe, and so on) was the prototype model for the sort of diplomacy that a significant number of people today believe is the way to deal with aggressive terrorists.  We saw exactly how well that strategy worked for Chamberlain, thanks to Winston Churchill's excellent chronicle.	2003-10-10

Their lifestyle arose in Italy, when the government was so corrupt that folks turned to powerful/wealthy families for assistance in obtaining justice.  In time, and following migration to other countries, the rule of law expanded -- but these powerful families did not go away.  They continued strong-arming others as they'd been doing, shaking down merchants and extorting money from businesses, skimming income from gambling and prostitution operations.  Still retaining the trappings of honor, such as fine clothing, jewelry, housing and autos, they reveal themselves to be plain old thieves and murderers, worthy of nothing but contempt and many years in prison.  Young readers might think it's a \\"neat\\" lifestyle -- hey, nobody bosses ME around -- but it's actually just plain old crime, and the perpetrators are all completely despicable.  <br />But again, it's a terrific story.

And this I would fight for:  the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes undirected.  And this I must fight against:  any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual.  This is what I am and what I am about.

Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts.  If the glory can be killed, we are lost.\\"<br />This is part of the reason a book such as \\"East of Eden\\" will continue to be read for pleasure, for study and for enlightenment -- whereas some communistic political hack's ghost-written piecemeal autobiography is destined by its nature to be a mere flash in the pan, and nobody will ever read it again after she has departed the stage.	2003-06-21

It wasn't a very enjoyable or riveting story, although I did not reach a point where I simply wanted to drop it.  It's about a young teen guy with an eccentric friend named Homer Fink, and they meet a girl their age.  The plot involves which one she will choose as her boyfriend.  Though Homer was a relatively odd guy, I don't recall any real humor from the story.  It was the first work I read that examined romance at a contemporary (my own age) level, and was valuable from that perspective.  It made the point that, at that age, one does not genuinely know what love means, regardless of how much a crush you have on someone.  To appreciate this book, it has to hit you at the right time in life.  It might be constructive for junior high school teachers to read it, and broach the subject of real romance -- affection between two young people -- with their students.	2003-05-15

While following Hogan's guide to the rudiments and advanced techniques of the game, do take care not to develop the destructive gambling, smoking and misanthropic attributes that manifest themselves in the overwhelming majority of golfers.  While Hogan's mechanics are subject to debate (such as keeping your right foot perpendicular to the line of flight in specific instances), his fundamentals will enable you to gain more control over the ball... even though you're otherwise occupied with an activity that stands unchallenged as the greatest waste of life in the universe.  Keep your head still, your left arm straight, grip firmly with the last three fingers of your left hand (for right-handed players), and always follow through.	2003-05-13

If other nations were governed by constitutions conceptually similar to that of the United States, establishing freedom and individual rights everywhere -- such that people would not feel it necessary to flee their home governments, and seek freedom in the United States -- this book never would have come into being.

Thanks to drug money, the police were corrupt.  Thanks to politics, state agents (such as medical examiners and prosecutors) were incompetent, and the elected leadership was both incompetent and highly corrupt.

Bradley	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Essential 20th Century History AND a Darned Good Book	I was extremely surprized by this book.  It is quite well-written and it tells a terrific story -- and though it is fully first-person, Omar Bradley comes across as a really fine guy.  While he genuinely earned the rank, authority and privilege he ultimately exercised as a top US Army general, the story of his slow-but-steady rise through the hierarchy conveys the depth of personality he had achieved by the time he reached the upper ranks.  A biography of George Marshall calls Bradley the &quot;most effective troop leader ever produced by the US military system,&quot; and one can certainly see the validity in that appraisal by reading his autobiography.  Bradley's honesty about other famous generals is interesting (though it is true he pretty much outlived all of them, and was able to have the final word) and appropriatedly honest/kind.  Not far into the book, you wish you actually knew him, he seems the sort who would make a great friend.<br />Bradley's evaluations of several significant events make this book essential reading for students of 20th Century history.  The perspective from which he witnessed everything was perfect for retrospective observation -- he wasn't so high up (like Churchill) that he had a global view, nor so low down that he could only see the trenches.  And his micro-brief account of Anthony McAuliffe's &quot;Nuts!&quot; episode is just laugh-out-loud funny.	2003-04-23

I was in high school at the time, and I remember the Woodstock explosion that occurred during the school year following the August concert, the remarkable number of classmates who adopted the hippie lifestyle and pretty much stopped doing any work whatever.  One guy who'd been a valedictory prospect dropped right off the academic radar, probably due to drugs.  Rand's suggestion that Woodstock represented an abandonment of reason is supported by on-scene reports of concert-goers who simply showed up with the clothes on their backs -- no plans for food, water, lodgings or anything, and the fact that concert organizers also neglected such essential considerations.  The Woodstock army completely trashed the place, ending up wallowing in a big muddy mess while standing stupidly outside in the rain.<br />On the other hand, the lunar mission was a sterling example of human achievement driven by rationality, the culmination of the application of brainpower to a problem, and the success which resulted therefrom.  Oh certainly, Rand drew (and draws) a lot of fire, but she was absolutely correct in her belief that upgrades of our human condition will only be developed by people who think and act, and not by herds of hippies standing in the rain.	2003-04-23

The job we performed was a support function, and we were always treated dreadfully by most of the people who considered their own jobs higher in priority.  This book essentially said, for us, &quot;Do your work extremely well and you will be rewarded with more work.&quot;  The harder you work, the more work you will be given to do.&quot;  <br />The principles adduced by the author are sound, but keep them to yourself if you decide to follow them -- a dishonest boss, learning of these principles, will merely exploit you for additional free labor.  Perhaps this volume should not have seen the light of day until after it could have properly been titled, &quot;How to be a productive executive, manager, supervisor and/or employee.&quot;  That way, everyone would understand that productivity is incumbent upon all levels of the organization, not just the poor chumps in the trenches.	2003-04-21

Despite what other reviewers have said, I think it is valuable to explore, in addition to factual details about Rand's life, the opinions harbored by those who knew her best.<br />It's also indicative, in one way or another, to see Barbara Branden's repetitive use of words and phrases Ayn Rand developed and employed -- expressions such as &quot;benevolent&quot; and &quot;sense of life&quot; and others.  On one hand that appears fawning and imitative, but another point of view might arise from understanding one of Rand's goals, which was to supply the language for describing and justifying the principles she illuminated.  If those words and expressions function as intended, hey, by all means go with them.  (But I did hear or read someplace that Leonard Piekoff conferred to such extent with Rand while writing his first book, &quot;The Ominous Parallels,&quot; that she hammered on his wording so much that it became indistinguishable from her own.)<br />It's also noteworthy to see those who attack Rand's so-named philosophy of objectivism by attacking her personally, much of their verbal weaponry supplied by this and Nathaniel's books.  Rand did not develop the principles of objectivism any more than Isaac Newton developed gravity; rather, they both simply recognized what existed and worked to define it.  That, I think, is why so many people feel inspired by Rand's writing -- they recognize principles by which they have lived, but have never actively contemplated... thus we return to the notion that Rand supplied the wording for their thoughts.<br />An acquaintance of mine read this book without knowing anything about Ayn Rand, and proclaimed it a riveting biography (though she still hasn't bothered to read any of Rand's books).  I read the bio after reading several of Rand's works, thus I was attentively watching for various milestones and background along the way.  It's therefore evident that whether or not you already know Ayn Rand, this is a book well worth reading.	2003-04-03

His major focus was upon warming your hands, willing your hands and fingers to feel heavier so that blood would flow to them and cause the temperature to rise.  He used a small card that measured stress with color codes, and you placed your thumb on the card to ascertain your stress level.  If you were really stressed out, the card stayed black -- but if your hands were extremely warm, the card turned blue.  Advanced students concentrated upon warming different fingers to different stress levels merely by concentrating.  One finger might turn the card blue, while another turned it green.  You must be careful not to leave your card on top of the refrigerator, though, because the heat from the refrigerator will turn the card permanently blue if you leave it there long enough.

When my company decided to buy into the Six Sigma program, our smiling managers told us in numerous town hall meetings that Six Sigma isn't just \\"another flavor of the month\\" -- that is, the latest magic bullet being sought by managers who seem always to want someone else to solve their problems and tell them exactly how to manage their businesses.<br />So naturally, on the very first page of \\"What is Six Sigma?,\\" we see the question, is Six Sigma \\"a new flavor of the month program?\\"<br />That makes a total of seven times in three weeks that I've been carefully told that Six Sigma isn't just another flavor of the month.  (I started keeping count after hearing it three times.)<br />Which says to me, quite clearly, that Six Sigma is just another of these flavor-of-the-month programs, the main result likely being layoffs in order to cut costs.<br />Plus, we've seen four presentations from one of the Six Sigma super-duper black belts -- pretty much the same presentation each time, this person bragging again and again about how she helped some apartment manager collect his rent three days earlier.  Our management has already bought the product.  Everyone is puzzled why we continue getting nothing but sales pitches.	2002-12-03

He appeared to constantly seek some force other than himself for improving his life -- such as communism then mysticism -- and seemed to believe we should all spend our lives tilling carrots in a truck patch.  He completely failed to appreciate the potential for human greatness, hence his sad ideological travels and empty quests.

It's about a family from Germany that settles in Texas, during its formative days.  Their young boy, Johann, is soon re-christened \\"Johnny Texas\\" in recognition of the family's new life.  <br />One day, Dad comes home with a slave, a young black man named Tobias who seems eternally morose, because they need help on their farm.  Soon, Dad decides to give Tobias his freedom; thereafter, Tobias is a much happier fellow.  He puts his bill of sale (proof of freedom) in a leather pouch and wears it around his neck.<br />Later, Dad gets involved in the war for Texas independence, and readers are treated to a BRIEF recap of the Battle of San Jacinto, wherein Sam Houston routed the Mexican army and captured Santa Anna.<br />This is a good book for seven-year-old Texans because they will, if they have been properly educated, recognize much of the Texas history -- plus, it's a simple story organized into chapters, and serves as an excellent introduction to the world of literature.  <br />I recommend this book to kids throughout the United States.

The author's tenacity demonstrates that passion in a subject invariably will yield complete understanding of that subject.  In this case, author Olsen concludes that Kennedy and Kopechne indeed were in the car together that night, but were frightened when it appeared a policman would stop them.  Kennedy evidently panicked, not wanting to be caught in the auto with her, and he got out; she then drove away, toward the bridge and her death.  Kennedy walked back to his hotel room, where someone saw him (dry and calm) a little later, seeking a newspaper.  The seat in the car was set for Kennedy, meaning that a shorter driver on a dark night would not have exercised as much control of the vehicle as he... thus being vulnerable to running off the road.<br />So, Olsen concludes that Kennedy was not in the car, he wasn't present to dive repeatedly into the water to try to save her, and he didn't even know about the drowning until the following morning -- thus Kennedy was actually innocent of the general accusation that he caused her death.  Problem is, he was in fact guilty of something equally dark, and you'll have to read the book to see Olsen's comments about that.<br />The author's passion was admirable.  It reminded me of Robert Graysmith's pursuit of the Zodiac killer, his personal immersion in the case.  \\"The Bridge\\" is a terrific book.  Find a copy and read it.	2002-09-27

David Lifton's first-person account provides extensive information about the assassination, logical analysis of the evidence, and conclusions drawn from that evidence.  <br />Lifton's thoroughness is evident.  At one one point in my reading, I had a strong feeling that if I'd ever done something illegal, the last person in the world I would want investigating the crime would be David Lifton.<br />My one criticism of the book is the brevity of the final conclusion, which presented Lifton's view of \\"what\\" without very much \\"how\\" at all.  His arguments are weak with regard to the mechanics of his theory, a conspiracy which would seem to involve an incredibly large number of individuals.  <br />Very persuasive, however, was his discovery of anomalies and differences in personal accounts, along with his suggestion that various individuals were actually witnessing (without knowing it) little pieces of the conspiracy in progress.  His suggestion that if a competentent conspiracy is carried out, no one will ever be aware that a conspiracy took place, also gave pause for thought.<br />One critique of this book stated that whether or not you agree with Lifton's version of events and his conclusion, EVERY piece of information with which he worked came from either government or public sources, all legitimately referenced and documented.  Best Evidence is a fine study in the art of investigation and analysis, worth reading from that aspect alone.	2002-09-25

Maureen Dean's account, speckled delightfully with detailed descriptions of the clothing/accessories other Watergate women are wearing, is comically young-minded.  Even so, its emanations form an illuminating penumbra (if that's possible) that reveals the spirit of the Nixon White House; a good example is the style of the fake-serious interoffice memo which John Dean submitted to Haldeman asking for time off to marry Mo.<br />An excellent companion piece to this book is \\"Silent Coup,\\" which adduces other, darker facets of John's and Mo's relationship.  Read \\"Mo\\" first, while you're still in the mood for levity.	2002-09-25

In 1970, having won district and bi-district championships, my high school football team played the Odessa Permian Panthers for the regional crown -- and they creamed us.  Most frightening was the crowd that came to Abilene from Odessa to watch the game.  They wore solid black (Panther colors) and they were FANATICS.  When the Panther band spelled \\"MOJO\\" on the field (I'd never encountered that term before) they went absolutely NUTS.<br />I finally understood the program a little better after reading Friday Night Lights, a terrific examination of the semi-pathological football infatuation in Odessa.  And I can't believe the author would ever return there, if he valued his life, because he certainly did not paint a flattering picture.  This book is WELL worth reading.  Everyone who ever went to high school will glean something valuable from it.<br />Most touching and telling, I thought, was the scene at the end of the book, after the season had ended, wherein the coach took down the slips of paper showing the names of the seniors who were on the team that year, and unceremoniously dumped them into the trash can.  That metaphorically demonstrated the entire town's ethos toward its high school football heroes.  After they no longer played for the team, they were just plain trash like everyone else.	2002-09-13

I am a totally ordinary guy, and I found that I was able to solve all of the games, puzzles and questions presented in this interesting little book.  All it required was some application, thought and tenacity.  For instance, when presented with a series of apparently random pictures and given a choice from among four of which image should appear next, all it took was a few minutes of thought and avoidance of the temptation to become frustrated.  I suddenly saw that the given figures were a person's right eye, a left foot, a right hand, a left ear.... so it didn't really take any sort of genius to determine that the next item would be a &quot;right&quot; something.  Desire and persistence are the keys, every time.<br />About the time I read this book, I met a guy who was extremely proud of being a Mensa member, and he too had solved everything in this Games book.  But he was lazy as a red brick, and worked as a machinist on a graveyard shift.  Right, Mensa.	2002-09-12

DeLorean rammed a literary ice pick into several nerves, though the entire presentation had a bit of an I-told-them-so-at-the-time shade to it.  <br />DeLorean later encountered his own executive problems at DeLorean Motors, but his lawyer was able to convince the jury that Naive John was a victim of entrapment.

It's an interesting story, and an essential souvenir if you grew up in Houston watching &quot;Don Mahoney and Jeanna Clair's Kiddie Troupers&quot; on Sunday morning television.  I found my copy at a second-hand store, and was delighted to find, after returning home, that Don and Jeanna had autographed the inside title page.<br />Their Kiddie Trouper show consisted of local children performing in some fashion, while Don and Jeanna (dressed like cowboys) provided guitar and vocal accompaniment. Sometimes there would be groups of little girls from a local tap-dancing class, and occasionally there were kids so young that they had no idea what was going on.  On one occasion, a little girl whispered something to Jeanna, and Jeanna immediately told everyone, &quot;Oh no, don't do anything to your hair, thinking you'll make it wave.  Mine waved naturally, when I was about 19.  So don't do anything to your hair when you leave here.&quot;  And then Don said, &quot;Yeah, my hair didn't start waving until I was about 35.&quot;  And Jenna said, &quot;Yes, it started waving goodbye.&quot;<br />The book features many photos.  One of the Kiddie Trouper child performers actually went on to achieve fame and fortune -- Annette O'Toole -- and that story is told.  This will be a difficult book to find, but it's worth having if you're a Don and Jeanna fan from way back.	2002-08-21

I ran across this fine volume at Half Price Books and couldn't resist acquiring it.  This is the supporting documentation for an entire undercurrent lifestyle, that of the Cheerleader.  It might alternatively be titled &quot;Full Immersion Cheerleading.&quot;<br />It covers stretching, exercises, health and nutrition, signs and waves, leaps and bounds, hollers and yells.  An appendix provides contact information (much of it probably now outdated) for cheerleading organizations (such as those associated with professional football teams) and another section presents some fundamental rules and other details about the sports at which cheerleaders actually lead cheers.  The only problem with CGTL is that is focuses overwhelmingly on female cheerleaders, barely even acknowledging that countless males also embrace the Cheerleader vision.<br />This book is a superb companion piece for the film &quot;Bring It On,&quot; which is the greatest cheerleading movie in history.

I'm certainly glad the truth was brought out, and that he was properly cleared and freed.<br />One point I found most interesting was Adams' sideline exploration of the fact that someone who opposes the death penalty cannot be excluded (for that reason) from the jury in a capital murder case.  It seems that juries are supposed to be representative of society, and a significant portion of society DOES oppose the death penalty -- thus it is appropriate for people who think that way to be allowed to serve on a death penalty jury.	2002-08-15

I didn't mind the redundancy about which others have complained; the repetition of some of the information about viral functions prompted retention, along with stirring the imagination as to the effects of a killer virus.<br />After reading the book, I performed some web searches an found several sites advertising hiking excursions to Mt. Elgon's Kitum Cave in Africa, which is believed to be he home of the Ebola/Marburg strains, though it's presently unknown which animal is the natural host.  Let me tell you, if you are sufficiently insane to visit Kitum Cave after reading The Hot Zone, then you are living proof of Darwin In Action.<br />I liked the author's analogy about fatal viruses, such as Ebola and HIV, acting at the Earth's own antibodies, protecting the environment from encroachment by humans in places where the Earth doesn't want humans to be fiddling with things.  Invasions of the deep rain forests and encounters with fatal biological agents therein are warnings for humans to stay away.<br />Have everyone in your family read The Hot Zone, so that next time someone gets sick you will have all sorts of terminology to throw around the dinner table -- extreme amplification, crash-and-bleed-out and other delightful descriptions about the effects of disease on humans.

The events and characters in the book are almost all the same as in the film, but the movie presents scenes in a different order and significantly revises the prominence/roles of various characters.  <br />I wish I had seen the process, which must have involved scores of 3x5 cards showing major scenes from the book, all rearranged and rearranged again to finally arrive at a linear progression for the movie... one just as good as, but totally different from, the book.<br />It's worth paying a little extra to obtain this rare volume, just to read the original story.

Forrest Pogue's volumes are far more comprehensive, though not from a human-interest standpoint.  Cray's and Mosley's works explore Marshall's more sensitive facets.<br />Marshall's towering integrity (he wrote no memoirs because he wanted no one profiting from them) has kept him in history's shadow, though he wasn't exactly cloaked in anonymity during WWII (since he reported to Roosevelt, and gave orders to MacArthur and Eisenhower).

It is probably good escapism for responsible teens who fantasize about abandoning school work and simply drifting, so long at they don't sink themselves into escape, fly from reality and start using drugs.  Though a low quality of life is portrayed in this book, the quality of the writing is high.  <br />On another level, this is an interesting look at the devastation which irresponsible parents can wreak upon a child, people who never had any business having kids in the first place.  To a thinking individual, the vagabond life that young Bone is leading is, initially, absolutely disgusting.  His values are non-existent, his behavior atrocious -- and then some facts emerge which make you understand, which make you feel genuinely sorry for the kid.<br />The question is, did Bone grow up, mature and move on in his life?

I thought it was a bunch of puerile stupidity.  My parents insisted I try, giving me permission in advance to quit, if I wanted to do so.  After about a week, however, the challenge and the spirit captured me completely, and -- despite the extremely difficult, peculiar environment -- I determined that nothing could make me quit.  An upperclassmen, one of Adams' contemporaries, advised one evening:  &quot;If you quit this, you will find that quitting is easy, and you will make it a habit.  It's the worst habit you can form.&quot;  <br />The habit of not quitting, for which I fully, wholly, completely credit the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&amp;M University, enabled me to complete the Army's Airborne and Ranger Schools while I was a cadet in the Corps, then later overcome numerous difficulties in my ensuing mainstream career.<br />Adams' book makes a fine gift for anyone thinking about going to Texas A&amp;M, anyone presently attending A&amp;M, anyone who ever went there, and all the folks who wish they had.  The Corps of Cadets is the embodiment, the vanguard, the foundation of the Spirit of Aggieland, and is responsible for making Texas A&amp;M a university worth attending.  <br />If you go to Texas A&amp;M and you don't join the Corps, you might as well have gone to Texas, TCU, San Marcos or any of the numerous other plain old vanilla fraternity/sorority schools in the state.

It's a nice-sounding title, it appears to be powerful, and in practice it means nothing.<br />Reading Newsweek Magazine one day, I happened to notice that Katherine Graham had been dubbed &quot;chairman of the executive committee.&quot;  I made a copy of that vignette from Up the Organization and mailed it to Ms. Graham (care of Newsweek), and asked whether she realized she had been booted upstairs to the holding pen.  The note must have struck a nerve; I got no reply.<br />If you work in a corporation, you will enjoy this book, as long as they don't make you chairman of the executive committee.	2002-05-15

The passage of almost three decades had blurred my memories substantially, but Lock's account resurrected a significant number of them -- little things that added so much richness to the course yet faded immediately upon graduation, plus some monstrous things that one's mind tends to dilute on purpose.  It's all here:  The kinetic, frenetic action of the first phase, the physical training, the long runs, the hand-to-hand combat sessions (along with taking a dive during the competitive portion, to avoid injury), the mess hall experience, chin-ups before every meal, reporting to the Tacs at every meal, low-crawling on that rocky road in the company area, the swelling unpleasance of Camp Darby, where night operations began the sleep deprivation process.  The descripion of the Mountain Phase is equally vivid, the terrible patrols up and down horrendous, 60-degree slopes in the dead of night, with fallen trees blocking the way, the fatigue really starting to take its toll now -- Lock's account brought it all back... the rain, the sleep-starvation, the hunger, and even a photo of those little Mountain huts I thought I'd never see again.<br />Lock noted something I considered significant at the time, an excellent example of the Ranger Department's psychological choreography.  At the end of the Mountain Phase, classes were roused early (0300) to make the return bus trip to Fort Benning from Camp Merrill.  Some students were feeling great after the Mountains, having passed all of their graded patrols; others, like me, were one up and two down -- on the brink of failing the course.  As the busses entered the Benning Ranger area later that morning, we saw the previous class standing on the old airstrip behind the City Team barracks, enjoying its graduation ceremony.  Students who were doing well (such as Lock) were jubilant and inspired; students who were faltering (like me) experienced a massive wave of depression.<br />Lock's account of the Florida phase was terrific... cold, wet, exhausted and starving.  I had forgotten how we surreptitiously obsessed over food, frequently murmuring about the things we would eat after we finished the course... fried chicken, cherry pie, gosh, hamburgers!<br />The last days of slogging through the swamps, the RELIEF when it was all finally over, the brevity of the double-time graduation ceremony (during my own, we saw the busses from the next class pass before us; more Ranger excellence in timing and execution!) -- it's all here. <br />Lock's constant use of vernacular was appropriate, reflecting how Ranger students, soon completely immersed in the training, communicate with one another.  You'll pick it up, after a few pages.  <br />This is a super little diary.  I just can't imagine how he found the energy or time to do it.  Enjoy, and Drive On.	2002-04-23

Their Trojan Horse technique carried them right into the lair of the auto thieves; after numerous exciting brushes with danger, they were able to escape and bring back the police.    The re-write wasn't nearly as tense.  It's possible that was purposeful.  At the end of the original, Fenton Hardy muted his pride for his sons' accomplishment with the admonition that their tactic had simply been too dangerous, and they could have been seriously injured or worse.      But that's what made the book good.  Kids enjoy stories of that nature because nothing like that ever happens to teens in real life.  Really, how many teams of teen-brother detectives do you think are operating in the USA just now, solving crimes and mysteries every other week (while owning cars, motorcycles, ice boats, airplanes, you name it)?

It contains some fascinating, mystifying tales, providing hours of entertainment.<br />I later discovered it was helpful in prompting a couple of young people (aged 10 - 11) to read more, for entertainment.  Edwards' vignettes are stimulating enough to capture the attention of today's youngsters, who've grown up with televisions and computers.  STS was a good transition tool for pushing them toward higher quality literature.<br />As an adult, years after taking a university journalism course, I happened to pick up Stranger Than Science again, and immediately discerned how weak the reporting was, how unsubstantiated the allegations and how non-existent the attribution.  Frank Edwards didn't seem to be much of a skeptic, which appeared to result in a lot of blithe acceptance of a lot of fantastic tale-telling.	2002-04-03

He discovers his abilities with Latin and literature, attracting along the way the attention of the town's one beautiful/smart girl -- but she's a fickle babe who falls for old money and simply strings Jed along for a couple of decades.  Jed experiences some periods of simpering self-pity, but grows more mature as the story progresses.<br />I think Robert Penn Warren intended for this tale to exercise the same degree of power as All The King's Men, and all of the elements are present (great writing, compelling characters and vignettes, introspective details), but the final product simply doesn't deliver the same overall impact.<br />One interesting point:  One episode features a horse-breeding interlude, which was virtually mirrored 20 years later in Tom Wolf's A Man In Full.

Every person is the general manager of his own job.<br />No Nonsense Management does not offer a panacea for managing your business.  Rather, it is a set of mental tools to employ in various and varying situations, which is why it occasionally seems contradictory (&quot;Move fast on reversible decisions&quot; versus &quot;Never make a decision until you have to&quot;).  It provides some good language for dealing with colleagues (&quot;Never tolerate mediocrity&quot;) and some reminders to always keep your feet moving (&quot;Solving one problem always causes additional problems&quot; and &quot;Good management is like vitamins; it needs to be applied daily).  <br />This book is especially useful for aggressive young subordinates in corporate situations who want to outshine their bosses.  Applying the axioms and using the language will always make you look better than the guy to whom you report, especially if he has never specifically studied the art of management.

The tac sergeant for my own class, in the 1970s, was the most outstanding soldier I have ever encountered, the most highly motivated individual I can imagine.  He added his own bit of spice to our course nearly every day, imbuing our experience with a richness other classes didn't share (I realized this after numerous visits with grads from other classes).  And the City Team group in the Harmony Church area was packed with memorable performers and personalities; my class was fortunate to fall under the incomparable administrative tutelage of the famous Sgt.

It is good to read in the event you are contemplating acquiring SAP for use at your company.<br />Let me just tell you, buddy:  A few years ago, some SAP salesmen staged their dog-and-pony shows for several major US oil companies.  Never mind that SAP is a manufacturing-oriented system, unfit to be congruent with hydrocarbon industry processes.  Their sales tap-dance dazzled the oil executives beyond all belief.  They were somehow convinced that SAP was the way of the future, and that industry functionality would be served if every oil company ran its accounting systems from the same basic platform.  The executives, none of whom had ever worked in the trenches -- and without consulting anyone who had worked in the trenches -- bought this pile of excrement hook, line and sinker.  <br />SAP is an accounting process nightmare.  It requires armies of people to run the thing, and its functionality is so counter-intuitive that EXTENSIVE training is required; there is NOTHING on the system that you can simply figure out from following menu paths.  It is indeed Rubik's Accounting System, a broad minefield strewn with mis-steps and unintended consequences.  NOTHING on SAP is ever easy, from ascertaining the business unit to which a cost center is assigned, to determining the set of vendor invoices that comprise the costs of a project.  <br />And, Heaven help you, if you must run SAP in tandem with some other system, such as your payroll program or a custom division-of-interest database.  It's tantamount to being busted for drugs in a foreign country:  You're in for the HASSLE OF YOUR LIFE.<br />On the other hand, if you are a member of the accounting profession, SAP can guarantee you a job for life (if you don't particularly mind NEVER being able to complete anything).  SAP is rife with unpleasant tasks that NO little kid ever dreams about doing when he grown up.  Accordingly, you willnever hear footsteps behind you, never face the prospect of someone else plotting to take your job from you.  SAP is the tar baby of accounting systems if you want job security:  You are stuck to it, and nobody else wants to come near you.<br />If you are reading this, it is quite likely that your company already has SAP, or is about to acquire it -- and you are one of the frightened, desperate, skippy-dog little bookkeeper minions, seeking reference information about this monstrous new system that's about to be shoved down your throat.<br />Good luck, chump.

They and their associates got into power by force, then systematically looted Argentina's wealth.  Propaganda forced everyone to pretend to admire them, and force required that everyone obey them.  <br />Evita's life, according to this book, generally follows the path portrayed in the Webber/Rice musical, but differed significantly along the way.  The musical version integrated apochryphal information, legendary stories, rather than employing hard fact.  A major example is \\"the first man to be of use to Eva Duarte.\\"  In the musical it was a popular tango singer named Augustin Migaldi -- as it was so in Evita's accepted local legend, since Migaldi was a relatively prominent performer.  The real guy, though, was a second-tier fellow named Armani, who helped Eva settle in the big city then pretty much vanished from history.<br />I wish the book had delved into more detail regarding more of Eva's specific activities -- such as the mechanisms/laws enacted to take over all the British holdings in Argentina -- but it was a good overview, a good foundation for moving on to other explorations of that blonde thug's puny excuse for a life.	2002-03-12

It's also useful for working newspaper folks to use as a reference book, to remind themselves, for instance, to include all the necessary components for a review of specific sorts of artistic endeavors.<br />Dr. Titchener read aloud much student work in the class I took, and he pulled no punches in evaluating the results.  There was one unfortunate woman who could not capably put one word in front of another, yet she bubbled constantly about what a great writer she intended to be, all the books and plays and articles she was going to author.  Dr. Titchener one day pronounced her work &quot;trite&quot; (he was absolutely correct), and it was extremely amusing to see the woman's cluelessly dismissive reaction, her declaration that he was &quot;an idiot.&quot;<br />About three-fourths of the way into the semester, Dr. Titchener had an uncommon experience in his own life, and he wrote a short feature about it, which he read to the class.  The response was brutal; students viciously ripped the piece up one page and down the other, and poor Dr. Titchener just sat there absorbing it all... sorta like body blows in a boxing match.

Here's a blustery mogul who assures everyone he just wants to help poor folks, yet he treats most of the people around him like dirt.  He weilds power by breaking people, digging up dirt and blackmailing them, a good example of the politics of personal destruction that our recent real-life First Felon whined about so pitifully (while employing those very techniques every chance he got).<br />Willie gives great speeches, the old-fashioned stump sermons that were rendered before television scared politicians into hiding their real personalities.  Willie speaks from the heart to his constituents, performing for them, making them mad, making them laugh, making them LISTEN.  Reading this makes you yearn for just one contemporary politician who would address people in such a manner.  It would be such a refreshing change from all those podium lemmings who continually grovel in search of sound bytes.<br />Willie vows to do good for all the poor folks who love him -- and, of course, his only means for doing that is to loot earned income from people who were foolish enough to be productive.  Willie is the master of doing good with other people's money.  He'd fit right in, with our Congress today.<br />In the end, Willie got what he deserved.  I just wish it had happened to him a lot earlier.	2001-11-12

Among other things, he insisted upon a lucrative compensation/house package, explaining that he simply could not be burdened with any personal financial considerations while dedicating his self-appraised tremendous powers to running Apple.  The Apple folks agreed, Sculley got his huge salary and his new house, and under his hand the company tanked down the tubes forthwith.<br />Sculley presented management lessons as his narrative progressed.  He did not directly discuss the matter of incentives, and the complacency which unearned wealth induces so quickly, electing instead to present that lesson by his own example.  Perhaps if Mr. Sculley had been more concerned about his own financial condition as a function of the company's success or failure, he would have been more highly motivated to do a better job running the firm.<br />At least one member of every corporate board of directors should read this book, and keep this lesson about incentives in mind whenever it's time to hire new executives and develop their compensation packages.	2001-08-17

He suggests that every aspect of your life is determined by the choices you make, and he supports that assertion with eminently plausible arguments and examples.  His book is quite illuminating, and if you read it thoroughly and critically, you will significantly upgrade your personal effectiveness in life.<br />Consider:  Have you ever been offended over something?  Well, the fact is that no one offends you but YOU.  Feeling offended is a CHOICE you make - as is being angry, embarrassed, irritated, annoyed, upset, exasperated, humiliated, degraded, guilty, insulted or any other state of mind.  Willey drives this valid point home very well.<br />Additionally, he focuses upon living in the present, the here and now, your body and your mind in the same place at the same time.  Such constant consciousness naturally leads to constructive choices, both internally and in your relationships with others.<br />Willey suggests you treat his book as a cafeteria, extracting from it the portions you can use.  The fact is, much of his philosophy is integrated, its components working well with one another.  Though he is a purist (he has to set that example, for gosh sakes, he's the one who wrote the book!), about 95 percent of his material is instantly comprehensible and useful - one need not perform exercises every night, or work at developing habits.  It's all pretty immediate.  <br />Thus if you don't want to feel a little guilty, and mess around in life because things come up, you will read this fine book and begin living it now... and in your every now.	2001-08-02

That is simply untrue.  The Industrial Revolution, an offshoot of the Enlightenment in Scotland, gave rise to the mass production and transporation of goods in the United Kingdom (by people seeking profits) which significantly upgraded the quality of life there.  One example is cotton; industrialization so increased the utilization of cotton that cloth became affordable to everyone -- people very quickly, for the first time in history, had access to inexpensive, clean and serviceable clothing.<br /><br />And there is the reality that people simply are not equal in ability, initiative, intelligence, energy and other productive attributes.  The elimination of profits in enterprises is a certain way to smother productivity and create equality.... equality of destitution.  Most curious is why the authors attacked capitalism.  What was their motive?  Insecurity, jealousy?  Capitalism has upgraded human existence on a wide scale as no other system ever has or can.  Why did this pair attack that?	2001-07-24

It contains a lot of background detail not reported in the mainstream media.<br />We are fortunate that the Tim McVeighs of the lunatic fringe are a distinct minority -- and in McVeigh's case, we definitely hope they are a minority of one.  It is evident from this book there are some strong, paranoid anti-government sentiments running in our land; those militia folks who don soldier costumes on weekends and caper through the woods are, in a word, kooks.  However, the \\"Patriots\\" revealed in American Terrorist, while frightening, appear to be relatively harmless, due primarily in their own stupidity -- all but one of them.  Though Tim McVeigh discussed his plans with Michael Fortier and Terry Nichols, and Nichols even helped with the bomb, I got the impression that it never dawned on those two nitwits that McVeigh would actually go through with it, that their activities were criminal, and that they were breaking laws merely by associating with him and listening to information about his intentions.  They were simply such stupid people that they subconsciously must have considered McVeigh as impotent as they, even though he spewed his violent anti-government rantings all the time.  They were incredibly surprised when they learned he had actually done it.<br />The danger to America continues because it's always possible another Tim McVeigh will emerge from this large herd of numbskull losers and actually commit a destructive act.  He is the one for whom we must watch out -- but the problem is, that next McVeigh will be the most difficult one to detect.	2001-05-29

Dr. Andrew Bernstein is sometimes called an &quot;Ayn Rand evangelist,&quot; but he prefers to describe his activities using a more sober expression, &quot;rational proselytization.&quot;  His Cliffs distillation accurately captures the gist of Atlas Shrugged, the plot and the philosophy, and his post-chapter analyses offer the sort of illumination that comes only from deep knowledge of, and unbridled enthusiasm for, the subject matter.<br />Atlas Shrugged is, for many, a difficult book to get into; I know people who say they've attempted to start it five or six times.  Given that Atlas is vastly richer than the Cliffs Notes version, my recommendation is for the reader to explore the Cliffs Notes and Atlas Shrugged simultaneously, chapter by chapter, first reading a condensed chapter and then the real thing.<br />And if you ever get the chance to see Dr. Bernstein in person, go for it.  He's a captivating and witty speaker, a genuinely inspiring Ayn Rand evangelist.	2001-03-30

The way they became wealthy, the way they accumulated a lot of money, was by (take a deep breath) holding onto their money and not SPENDING it!  Well, DUH!  When you see some dude driving an expensive car, wearing an expensive suit and an expensive watch, taking expensive vacations and so forth, you must remember that all those things represent money he NO LONGER OWNS!<br />As Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged gave us the concepts and language to support and defend the absolute morality of capitalism, The Millionaire Next Door supplies us with the intellectual substantiation for being a tight-wad and not being one bit ashamed of it.<br />I will now get into my 13-year-old Honda (with 151,000 miles on it), drive down to the bank and look at all my money.	2001-01-05

The book, however, was much much better, far richer with detail, riddles and twists.  Today, the film, while still interesting, has not aged well in comparison with contemporary action-adventure works... but the book still stands up, still holds its own, still commands a reader's attention and enjoyment page after page.	2000-11-21

Everest Disaster	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Darwin In Action	This book is an interesting expedition into the minds of people who behave stupidly in order to prove something to others or to themselves, and who reap exactly what they deserve.  It's a tale about people with no regard  for the feelings of their families and friends, self-centered people who  drop out of life for awhile to crawl up a rock and possibly die.  It's  about people with too much time and money on their hands, and too little  sense to use their resources constructively.  It is a great book, a great  story, and serves as a magnificent example of what NOT to do with your life  in our world today.  Best of all, hats off to Charles Darwin, it is a very  clean-cut demonstration of the process of natural selection, illustrating  triumphantly the manner in which pure idiocy typically, and appropriately,  gets erased from the human gene pool with ruthless dispatch.	2000-05-16

If you've ever seen the magnificent, nationally famous Texas A&amp;M University Band perform during half-time, you will want to own this fine volume.  It offers a comprehensive history of the first 100 years of a  college organization that has become, literally, a state institution.   Being in the Aggie Band is not simply membership in a music outfit; rather,  it is a comprehensive, fully consuming Way of Life.  Rich with details  about how the present-day Band evolved, the Powells' account also grandly  illuminates other facets of Texas Aggie history - the Corps of Cadets,  A&amp;M athletics, campus development, memorable faculty folks and general  local color (in native lingo, &quot;good bull.&quot;).  Numerous photos  trace Aggie traditions from their earliest days to the present.  It was  startling to this reader how some campus/Corps images are practically  ageless.  Many of the pictures - fish standing on the wall, Elephant Walk,  Ags working on the Bonfire, meals in Duncan Dining Hall - could have been  taken in 1930 or 1950 or 1975 OR 1995, since the traditions, and the scenes  they propagate, are so firmly embedded at A&amp;M.  <br />This book definitely  needs to be made into a movie.  Not only would it offer remarkable  settings, dramatic events, dynamic characters, stupendous role models,  intricate Band drills and tantalizing college-life plots, but it would  feature, without a doubt, the very best film soundtrack in the history of  the world.	2000-05-01
