Each chapter selects a particular diet myth and addresses it from a scientific and practical point of view. For example, there is a chapter about the myth of not bothering to lose weight anymore because it never lasts anyway. This chapter explains the health impact of carrying around extra weight, and intersperses true stories of people who have lost weight and kept it off. The inspirational stories in this book come from Weight Watchers Lifetime Members. This is not a fad diet book, and it does not offer meal plans and \\"secrets.\\" This is an informative, intelligent, and well-researched book that will help you find your way to lasting weight loss.	2005-09-05

It was even awarded The International Association of Culinary Professionals Cookbook of the Year.<br />The recipes are organized into Cakes, Complementary Adornments for all Cakes, Ingredients and Equipment, and a Special Section for Professionals and Passionate Amateurs. There is a Special Categories Index which lists recipes organized by special dietary needs, such as no cholesterol recipes, quick cakes, and even cakes for Passover. With the hundreds of cakes listed in this book, there are only pictures for 50 of the recipes.<br />I baked the Chocolate Bread Pound Cake recipe on page 28. All of the ingredients were readily on hand: cocoa powder, water, vanilla, eggs, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. The recipe listed the number of servings, ingredients by both measure and weight, an illustration of suggested pans, finished height, storage guidelines, adornment suggestion, serving temperature, and even pointers for success. This finished cake came out very dry. So dry, in fact, that I just threw it away. In the understanding section of this recipe, they suggest using a syrup for extra moistness. If I needed this recipe in the future, I would be sure to use the syrup with it.<br />I also used the Chocolate Ganache recipe on page 269. Her directions on using the food processor to prepare the ganache really saved time, and produced a perfectly smooth finished product. The recipe produces enough ganache to fill and frost two 8x1.5&quot; layers or two 9x1&quot; layers. The ganache is a delicious finish to a cake, and I use it often with dense chocolate cakes.	2003-04-29

This 50-page, full-color cookbook is a delight for fans of Western baking. Tuda Libby Crews walks you through the process of creating beautiful, authentic, Western-themed cookies step-by-step. From recipes for cookies, icings, and even a pattern for a chili-pepper shaped cookie, Tuda shows you how to make extraordinary cookies in your own kitchen.<br />I made the Buffalo cookies using Tuda's copper Buffalo cutter. The Chocolate Buffalo Dough used ingredients that I had readily on hand: butter, shortening, flour, chocolate, eggs, vanilla, and sugar. Using Tuda's Tips, I was able to efficiently and easily roll out the dough. No struggling with crumbling dough here! The dough had a beautiful texture and was very easy to handle. However, the dough is very stiff and it mixes best in a large mixer (I used a 6-quart mixer).<br />The cookies baked best using parchment paper. The parchment paper really made a difference in holding the shape of the cookies. The cookies had a light and almost chewy-texture, depending on how thickly you roll them out. They were not brittle.<br />After baking, I cooled and iced them just like Tuda, even accenting the Buffalo coats with chocolate sprinkles (or jimmies). The cookies were happily received and applauded. These Chocolate Buffalo cookies are original, unique, and remarkable. You'll enjoy making them as much as eating them!<br />This cookbook also includes recipes for Cowboy Sugar Cookies, Adobe Frosting, and Sugar Baby Frosting. Tuda thoughtfully includes Tips for Rolling-Out, Cutting-Out, Baking, and Decorating the cookies. The Decorating techniques are clear and easy to follow. Tuda even tells you how to pack these cookies for shipping them long distances!<br />You will enjoy this cookbook from cover to cover. It makes for lovely afternoons with your family, or even as a baking adventure for cookie lovers. Go ahead, bake a herd of Buffao and start a stampede to your kitchen!	2003-03-21

The ingredients were readily available: cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, milk, egg, shortening, and vegetable oil. The bread had a wonderful, mealy texture and tasted best when served with a sweetened honey butter. The bread itself had a slightly tart flavor to it, and is meant to be served with something else, not to stand on it's own.<br />The recipes are varied and diverse, and most include a full-color photograph.

Did you ever see the movie \\"Notting Hill\\"? Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant starred in it. Over a birthday dinner, they shared a plate of brownies. To get the last brownie, they each had to tell a story about why their life was the most miserable, and \\"earn\\" the brownie. Some characters shared pitiable stories about infertility, paralysis of the legs, and even losing their jobs. Julia Roberts' character played a movie star, and she earned the last brownie by saying that her life was filled with endless diets, plastic surgery, and an abusive boyfriend who didn't find her attractive. The brownies were large, dense, and dark with chocolate. At last, I have discovered the recipe in The Best of betterbaking.com.<br />Betterbaking.com got started when Marcy Goldman was asked to appear on a local radio show hosted by Yvan Huneault. Bearing baked gifts, she was welcomed to the show and became a regular guest. Huneault encouraged Goldman to start a web site for baking, and betterbaking.com was born. Since it's inception, bakers from all over the world have visited this Internet \\"bakery\\" and discovered recipes, tips, and tricks from the world's most gifted bakers. Julia Childs, the New York Times, and even Eric Clapton's road manager have been guests of betterbaking.com.

Each recipe has an ingredient list, portion size, paragraph of where the recipe came from, and instructions on how to prepare the recipe. Only 16 of the recipes are illustrated, and there is no nutritional information provided. The authors note in the introduction that \\"unless you have special dietary requirements, a reasoned approach to eating will serve you better than an obsession with fat.\\"<br />While the emphasis in the book appears to be on breads, I just had to try the cover recipe - \\"Notting Hill Brownies.\\" The recipe calls for ingredients that I keep readily on hand: butter, sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, cocoa powder, flour, baking soda, salt, nuts, and confectioner's sugar (for dusting). The recipe makes a generous 9x13\\" pan of brownies. The brownies were, as promised, \\"chewy, but not mucky or sludgy.\\" The chopped pecans helped to break up the chocolate, keeping the brownies from being overpowering. I served the brownies to family and friends, who all applauded heartily. A winning recipe!<br />On page 254, I attempted the \\"Ben's Bistro Chocolate Fudge Cake.\\" While the ingredients were not exotic - water, melted chocolate, flour, baking soda, salt, butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and cream - I really struggled with this recipe. The first time I baked it, the cake fell in the oven. On my second attempt, the cake was too dry (I had increased the baking time to prevent another episode of falling). I was able to compensate for the dryness of the cake by using a wet, cream-based filling and generous amounts of frosting, but this is not a recipe I would use again.<br />Experienced bakers will appreciate the variety of recipes, as well as the French influence.

Cooking with the Saints, by Ernst Schuegraf, is a magnificent volume of cooking inspiration for Catholics. This full-color hard-cover book is so elegant, I hated to drop batter on the beautifully designed pages! At 330 pages, this heavy volume covers recipes for saints from Agnes to Wilfrid. The recipes have been meticulously culled from many nations, traditions, and time periods, to arrive to us in one complete book.<br />The recipes have conversions for United States and European cooks. Each recipe features a short biography of it's namesake saint, as well as full-color photograph. The recipes are diverse and include: Stuffed Peppers in Walnut Sauce, Soup for Saint Francis Xavier's Day, Melachrino Cake, Saint Margaret's Lebkuchen, Saint Martin's Day Duck, Saint Roch's Fingers, and Saint Theresa's Bread.<br />The 3-page Introduction by Schuegraf tells us the story of his inspiration. He discusses some of the differences cooking and baking has undergone, and tells us that he has done his best to retain the recipes as they were found. Some of the recipes are pulled from antique cookbooks, and many others were carefully researched at St. Francis Xavier Library.<br />Saint Barbara, pages 33 - 36, is a prime example of the quality of work put into this book. The biography of Saint Barbara encompasses what is known of her life from the third century, a thirteenth-century book about her, and even legends about her father. Page 33 features a beautiful fifteenth century painting of her by Jan Van Eyck. The author attributes three recipes to Saint Barbara's name: Saint Barbara Cake, Pork Tenderloin Saint Barbara, and Dessert for Saint Barbara's Day.<br />I prepared the Saint Barbara Cake in my kitchen at home. The ingredients were readily on hand: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and a lemon. This cake has a silky texture, due to the large amount of cornstarch that goes into the recipe. The cake possesses a light, lemony flavor with a dense but silky texture. It is a perfect accompaniment to your morning ritual, substitute this lovely cake on December 4th (Saint Barbara's day) for your muffin or bagel.<br />Ernst Schuegraf has created a treasure for Christian bakers with Cooking With the Saints.

He takes us on his journey through reading rooms all over the United States, musty cookbooks and the beginnings of Bake-Offs. Interspersed throughout the text are historical blurbs discussing \\"Hints to the Working Classes\\" (1846), \\"Weights and Measures\\" The New England Economical Housekeeper (1846), and \\"Recipe or Receipt?\\" Following the Introduction are thirty pages \\"About the Ingredients.\\" This valuable section discusses types of flour, leaveners, sugar, fats, nuts, and a listing of equipment used in the book.<br />Baking in America features twelve chapters of recipes. Some of the chapter titles are: Sweet Yeast Breads and Doughnuts, Layer Cakes, Cheesecakes and Tortes, Cookies, and Fruit Desserts. The recipes themselves are adapted for today's bakers, there are no antique baking tools called for or obscure ingredients. The recipes range from Buttermilk Bread to Chocolate Tart in a Chocolate Crust.<br />Patent has meticulously researched the recipes in this book. For example, the Golden Butter Layer Cake with Chocolate Frosting on page 260 includes this introduction: \\"I've based this cake on the nineteenth century 1-2-3-4 cake, made with 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.\\" Patent doesn't stop with historical trivia, he also shares the elimination of the flour category in the Pillsbury Bake-Off in 1996 on page 114.<br />I made the Caramel Pecan Candy Bar Cookies on page 421. These \\"cookies\\" are bar cookies, not individually baked. The recipe makes 20 bars, baked in an 8-inch by 8-inch pan. The recipe is very easy to prepare, and yields a treasure of tastes. This treat calls for: butter, brown sugar, salt, vanilla, flour, caramels, evaporated milk, and pecans. The bars have a crunchy crust that is reminiscent of a fine shortbread. The topping, composed of caramels, vanilla, and pecans, adds a chewy texture, hence the \\"candy bar\\" in the recipe name. These bars are pure, simple goodness.<br />Some of the recipes call for special equipment. For example, the very last recipe in the book, Chocolate Tart in a Chocolate Crust calls for a ten-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. To compensate for using recipes calling for special baker's tools, Patent has provided a listing of Sources for Books, Equipment, and Ingredients on page 522. On pages 528 - 535, there is an extensive Bibliography including everything from The Original White House Cookbook to Civil War Recipes. The alphabetical index has 11 different recipes under the heading \\"cake\\" and 29 recipes for \\"Cookies.\\"<br />Greg Patent has left a historical treasure for future generations of bakers.

The interviews themselves convey a sense of intimacy; you feel as if you're sitting in a meeting with all of Cisco's e-Support teams, getting an interior view of how their organization is structured and what methods they use. For example, you learn that Cisco has  dedicated technical writers within the support teams to transform customer issues into meaningful support content. Also, a bonus of the interview format is that it allowed the book's designer to leverage white space effectively, alleviating the feeling of density that sometimes characterizes a text-heavy book.<br />The target audience for this book is CEOs and Senior VPs seeking to either implement an e-Support solution or improve an existing one. Of particular interest to these execs is the chapter on metrics, which  provides graphics and sample charts showing the kinds of metrics Cisco relies on. (Walker Information regularly surveys Cisco customers regarding the TAC Web site content).  It examines the greatest challenges involved in acting on these  metrics, as well as what metrics are meaningful and where they come from. For example, Cisco measures what technical articles customers access most frequently so that their tech support team can proactively get that information to customers in a more direct form - either via  e-mail messages or by making the content more visible on the TAC Web. Cisco also measures customer satisfaction with the technical content on the Web site, so that they can improve its effectiveness and accessibility..<br />As for the  book itself, it has one big weakness: It is not a blueprint. Although it provides a  useful peek inside a successful e-Support implementation, it does not offer a step-by-step method for creating a comparable system for your company or for \\"saving millions\\" with your own e-Support solution. The authors could have done a better job of setting appropriate expectations in an Introduction explaining the book's scope and goals or by writing a Conclusion that summed up the interviews. Also, they really don't talk about how the Cisco e-Support model might translate to other companies. Will it scale down for companies that don't have the resources to assemble a marketing team devoted exclusively to e-Support or a team of writers and editors to gather and shape content from support engineers?hod for creating a comparable system for your company or for \\"saving millions\\" with your own e-Support solution.

Returning from the War in 1946, Elijah is scarred by the battles he has seen. His hands shake as he tries to sip a cup of coffee with his mother. His mother sagely suggests he spends some time with a remote branch of their family, the Tabers in Missouri. Nestled deep in the Ozarks, the Missouri Tabers have struggled and survived in that harsh landscape. Byers tells the stories of the people of Lost River Bridge, in their own words. Each chapter is a miniature novel in itself, as the characters warp and weave around one another. The uniting thread of all these stories is a Saint Christopher medal that was given to Granny Taber 150 years ago.<br />The strength of this novel is Byers' ability to tell a tale in the true style of the Ozark storytellers. When reading this novel, you're never quite sure what is fact and what is fiction. However, this story-telling style also does not lend itself well to fluid reading. There were several passages that had to be read out loud or re-read before they could be understood. There are nuances in vocabulary and punctuation that needed special attention while reading.	2003-01-14

The plot has two major threads:<br />- Thread One: Murdo, our hero, who follows his father and brothers to Jerusalem in 1099 from his home in the isles.<br />- Thread Two: A man whose name &quot;is of no importance&quot; in Scotland in 1899. He is an initiate of a sacred and secret Brotherhood.<br />The plot follows Murdo through the &quot;taking of the cross&quot; to falling in love with Ragna, and the misfortunes heaped upon his family by the greedy local Bishop. Murdo travels to the Holy Land, on his own, to find his brothers and father and restore his family's lands. As he searches for his family in Jerusalem, he witnesses the terrible sacking of the city in 1099. Murdo is witness to political intrigue, many battles, and foreign cities and customs.<br />The details of the second plot are interspersed throughout Murdo's journey. The reader is never quite sure how this Brotherhood relates to Murdo, the lines are left deliberately vague. This vagueness compels you to keep reading the series, to determine how these ancient Crusades fit in with 1899 Scotland and this mysterious Brotherhood.<br />Lawhead has created a captivating novel with The Iron Lance. The attention to detail and historical accuracy make this a compelling work of historical fantasy.	2003-01-09

Francis Randolph takes a practical and personable approach to the sacrament of confession. This is a helpful book for Catholics who have been away from the sacrament for some time, or for Catholics who are wondering if they go too often (&quot;scruples&quot;).<br />The book is structured into eleven chapters, encompassing the entire form of the sacrament. From &quot;Bless me Father for I have sinned&quot; to &quot;the merits of the Blessed Virgin Mary,&quot; Fr. Randolph explains both the form and meaning of each part of the sacrament.<br />Mixed in with the theological and canonical discussions, Fr. Randolph brings in the practical experience he has, from ministering to a large congregation in England. Fr. Randolph shares humerous and poignant stories, engaging the reader in an otherwise dry topic. Fr. Randolph takes pains to explain the changes since Vatican II, and encourages Catholics to engage in the new forms. He also addresses common questions such as, &quot;how often should I go to confession?&quot; and &quot;what is a sin?&quot;.<br />This is a worthwhile read for all Catholics who want to understand confession. At 185 pages, it is a short but valuable addition to Catholic studies.	2003-01-09

The cake designs in this book use a combination of buttercream icing and chocolate accents. Instead of fondant, the authors use ganache, glaze, or buttercream to paint the canvas of the cake. Recipes for House Buttercream, Kaye's Buttercream, Chocolate Glaze, and a Whipped Chocolate Ganache are included. To fill the cakes, recipes for Lemon Curd, Whipped Cream, and Cookies and Cream are provided. The cakes themselves run the gamut from a traditional Chocolate Butter Cake to an artistic Ode to Jackson Pollock.<br />The Introduction to this book is a two-way conversation with Kaye and Liv. They discuss the Bakehouse itself (located in New York State), the merits of edible flowers, and Liv's special chocolate decorations. Part One  moves into the basics of cake decorating. The authors provide a list of tools, instructions on working with chocolate, a color mixing chart, and step-by-step directions on preparing the cake for decoration (tilted and flat cakes are included here).<br />The Mini Birthday Cake recipe on pages 62 - 65 features a ten-inch tilted cake. These unusual cakes  feature prominently in recent cake magazines and publications. One side of the cake is markedly higher than the other, creating a slope across the top surface of the cake. The Mini Birthday Cake is anything, however, but mini! At ten inches, it will comfortably serve 15 guests at your party. The authors introduce this cake as the product of a \\"Cat in the Hat baker\\". The cake is adorned with bright purple, orange, yellow, lime green, and teal buttercream icing.<br />The authors recommend using the Chocolate Butter Cake recipe (page 65) for the birthday cake. The recipe calls for coffee, cocoa powder, water, cake flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. The recipe calls for baking the cake in two 10x3\\" pans by increasing the baking time, it is only necessary to bake one 3\\" layer. The finished cake is moist and delicate, lending itself well to the suggested cookies and cream filling. The cake is billed as pleasing \\"screaming kids.\\" I don't know about that, but it sure worked for my husband! The combination of coffee and cocoa gives the cake depth of flavor.<br />After baking and cooling the Chocolate Butter Cake, I prepared the Cookies and Cream filling (page 65). This simple recipe is truly astonishing. The recipe calls for heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and crushed Oreos. The taste was reminiscent of a heavy ice cream, but with the texture of a cloud. It is glorious. Combined with the Chocolate Butter Cake, it is truly a delight.<br />Once the cake had been layered and filled, I prepared the House Buttercream recipe (page 36). This recipe has a surprisingly high ratio of sugar to shortening and butter. For six cups of sugar, the recipe uses 2¾ cups high-ratio vegetable shortening in addition to 1½  sticks of butter. This ratio gives the icing an understated flavor, making it an ideal complement to the heady chocolate cake and filling. The icing requires a mixing time of 10 - 20 minutes in a large mixer. Due to the long mixing time, the icing is extremely light in texture, and has a very thin consistency. One full batch of this icing (9 1/2 cups), will ice and decorate the ten-inch mini birthday cake. The completed recipe will fill a five-quart mixing bowl. For hand mixers, you will need to cut the recipe in half.<br />The House Buttercream is ideally suited to the bright colors used in the Mini Birthday Cake. Very little color gel was needed to achieve a bright, vivid color. However, the high shortening and butter content makes this icing extremely greasy. While the texture is light and airy on the tongue, there is a sheen of shortening left on the palate after eating the icing. Also, the shortening makes for some extra work in cleaning up. Be sure to use a good grease-cutting detergent and hot water when washing out your mixing bowls. Parchment decorating bags may be a wise choice for this icing, cutting down on your cleaning time. The thin consistency of the icing is ideal for icing the cake, handling beautifully in large quantities. However, the Mini Birthday Cake calls for some string work garlands. Thin consistency icing will not fall correctly and has to be traced onto the cake, instead of pulling out a traditional string. This will impact the roundedness of the string work, and has to be compensated for by the decorator.ing down on your cleaning time.

Betty Crocker's Cooky Book was originally printed in 1963. Yes, it's cooky, not today's cookie.<br />The 2002 reprint includes only two short paragraphs of introduction on the title page. The new paragraphs provide warnings about today's ingredients and food safety concerns. They encourage you to ask your mother or grandmother how to make them if you don't understand the ingredients or the recipes. What a great way to share a family heritage, by baking cookies together!<br />The cookbook is divided into 6 sections: Cooky Primer, Holiday Cookies, Family Favorites, Quick `N Easy Cookies, Company Best Cookies, and Betty Crocker's Best Cookies. The Cooky Primer section includes instructions on how to \\"measure flour by dipping,\\" Necessary Utensils (including a \\"rotary egg beater\\"), Baking Hints, and a Q&amp;A section which covers self-rising flour, correcting cooky dough, and how to prevent soft cooky dough.<br />The Cooky Primer section includes a color picture at the bottom of each page, showing the finished cookies and brownies. On page 11 of the Cooky Primer is a recipe for Butterscotch Brownies. This recipe is my husband's favorite. All the recipe calls for is butter, brown sugar, an egg, flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and walnuts. This brownie recipe spells out the secret to baking perfect brownies: \\"Do not overbake!\\". My Uncle Glen is a commercial chef, and he taught me that little gem at the precocious age of 10. These brownies have a wonderful butterscotch flavor, and come out of the oven chewy and golden brown.<br />In the Heritage Cookies section, I baked the Old-Fashioned Sour Cream cookies on page 79. This recipe is a little more complex, it calls for shortening, sugar, an egg, vanilla, flour, baking powder, soda (that's baking soda, not tonic), salt, nutmeg, and \\"commercial sour cream.\\" These little cookies retain their shape beautifully, without using parchment paper! Their delicate texture is accented with a touch of nutmeg, making them a wonder for lovers of spice cakes. One batch made 53 individual cookies.<br />The authors truly saved the best for last with this cookbook. The final section, Betty Crocker's Best Cookies, features favorite cookie recipes over time. Betty Crocker's time begins with Hermits from 1880! Starting with 1880, the cookie recipes move in 10-year increments. For example, 1890-1900 Cinnamon Jumbles. 1920-1930 Brownies. 1930-1935 Molasses Crinkles. These heritage recipes are accented by historical highlights and humorous anecdotes such as \\"the first brownies were a fallen chocolate cake.\\" This section is made for cookbook lovers of all ages.

The book is also completely printed in full-color, so the pictures are bright and glossy. About 80% of the recipes include a picture of the finished product.<br />There is an intriguing introduction where the authors take you on a journey through the mystical world of cake mixes. They begin in 1943 in the Betty Crocker labs and kitchens, and move from there through the trends of the 1960's and into the future of cake mixes in the 21st century. The pictures and magazine ads they reproduce in this book are historical and fun. Before the recipes begin, there is a how-to section on preparing your pans, servings per cake, how to cool and split (torte) a cake, frosting and glazing cakes, and even high-altitude baking. Page 15 features a \\"Customer Q&A\\" about the SuperMoist cake mixes.<br />The recipes are divided into chapters: Bake-and-Take, Wonderfully Indulgent, Special Celebrations, Heavenly Holidays, Come for Brunch, Scrumptious Desserts, Easy Cookies and Bars, and Fabulous frostings and Glazes. The cookbook also adds sections on Helpful Nutrition and Cooking Information, and an alphabetical Index.<br />The Heavenly Holidays sections features cakes for beginning cake decorators. These cakes require no previous cake decorating experience, and look beautiful. There are chocolate heart cakes for Valentine's Day (no heart pan needed!), an adorable Easter Bunny, a Flag Day cake made with fresh fruit, a Jack O' Lantern cake (no 3-D cake pan needed), and even Rudolph Cupcakes which can be made with children.<br />My favorite recipe from this cookbook is on page 18, Chocolate Turtle Cake. If you like the combination of nuts with chocolate, this recipe is for you! The recipe has a full-color picture, a tip for serving, and nutritional information. All of the recipes in this cookbook feature nutritional information. The turtle cake recipe calls for a devil's food cake mix, water, oil, eggs, caramels, evaporated milk, pecans, and chocolate chips. The recipe requires a bit of planning as caramels are not a staple item that I keep on hand. The final product, however, is well worth the planning.

There are no quick fixes or extreme measures promoted in this book. This is a book for people who are serious about long-term weight maintenance. It is about making lasting changes in the way you eat, the way you think, the way you exercise, and the way you look at yourself. Using proven methods of long-term weight loss, the authors provide an abundance of information and exercises designed to help you make the lasting changes that will enable you to be successful.<br />The only part of this book that was not helpful for me was the recipe section at the end. Most of the recipes were not what I would normally eat. Items such as Lemon-Lime Swordfish with Mango Salsa or a Chocolate Egg Cream are just not things I would normally prepare.	2002-12-12

The book comes in a 7 1\2' by 5 1\2' size, with spiral binding and a plastic cover. The packaging makes the book extremely useful ' no propping the pages open or worrying about wrecking the cover by dropping cake batter all over it. All cookbooks should be this easy to bake with!<br />The book is great for a wide range of bakers, but parents will value this book as a treasure chest of family fun. The final chapter of the book is 'Children's Delights.' The recipes include 'Delicious Dirt', which is a recipe for a chocolate pudding cake, covered with 'dirt' (crushed Oreo cookies). There are seasonal recipes for holiday activities, such as 'Valentine Cookies,' 'American Flag Cake,' 'Halloween Spider Cake,' and even a 'Peppermint Cake.' The children's chapter will guarantee fun for cooking with your children during the holidays.<br />While baking from this book, two recipes in particular stood out: 'Heavenly Brownies' and 'Sweet Delights.' 'Heavenly Brownies' (page 25) is a classic cream-cheese brownie recipe, without the brownie mix. Ashcraft substitutes a chocolate cake mix in place of the traditional brownie mix. These brownies bake wonderfully, they are moist and decadent. The 'heavenly' twist in the name makes them ideal for church bake sales and Sunday school classes. I pack them in tins and give them away as 'care packages.'<br />The 'Sweet Delights' recipe (page 37) is a sure kid-pleaser. My test audience was my one-year-old nephew. He gobbled these cookies down, leaving behind nothing but a chocolate-covered giggle and fudgy handprints on his highchair. The cookies are moist, chewy, and don't involve measuring a large amount of ingredients. The recipe relies solely on a cake mix (of any flavor, I chose Devil's food), brown sugar, oil, eggs, and chocolate chips. They were almost too easy for how good they tasted. A winning recipe!<br />For fans of bundt cakes, Ashcraft includes recipes for eight different varieties of bundt cakes. 'Give me a bundt cake and no one gets hurt!' The recipes include classic favorites such as Death-By-Chocolate and Luscious Lemon. For newer favorites, there are Pistachio Pound Cakes and Cream-Cheese Lemon Pound Cakes. There is a variety of bundt cake in this chapter to please every palate.<br />On the whole, this cookbook relies on readily-accessible ingredients: cake mixes, brown sugar, eggs, oil, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, nuts, and flour. Some recipes, however, require planning as they use ingredients that you may not keep handy. Cherry pie filling, lemon instant pudding, wheat germ, cream cheese, and sour cream are examples of ingredients I did not have stocked as I perused the recipes.<br />My one difficulty with using this book is that there are no pictures. Not one. There's not even a smiling picture of the author. Not having a reference for colors and textures is aggravating, you have to guess your way along unfamiliar recipes. There is also no guide for decorating ideas. This requires a fair bit of experience and creativity on the part of the reader. However, the cover price makes it a bargain purchase, pictures of no pictures. The Helpful Hints section on page 9 also adds a lot of value to this innovative book.or eight different varieties of bundt cakes. 'Give me a bundt cake and no one gets hurt!'

Snider uses basic cake mixes to create Pineapple Mandarin cakes, Lemon Glazed Cheesecake Squares, and even a Chocolate Yule Log. In total, there are over 150 recipes in this book.<br />The most popular recipe in this book in my household is the Chocolate Nut Bars, on page 148. The recipe only uses ingredients that I readily have on hand: chocolate cake mix, eggs, butter, brown sugar, canned icing. The recipe was simple, easy-to-follow, and tasted great.<br />While I had success with the Chocolate Nut Bars, many of the recipes in the book rely on ingredients that I don't have readily at hand. For example, sour cream, cream cheese, light cream, plain yogurt and heavy cream are called for in many of the recipes. These ingredients spoil quickly, and I only buy them when I need to \\"plan\\" for some baking. If the idea of this book is for use by cooks \\"on the go,\\" I'm not sure how successful they will be using the recipes in a hurry if planning is required for the ingredients.<br />The format of the book made it easy to use. The pages utilized white space effectively, and the side bars containing tips and variations really added value. However, the recipes were lacking nutritional information. In today's health conscious society, nutrition information is essential, even if the recipes are far from \\"health conscious.\\" For a future revision of this book, I would strongly recommend adding that information.<br />When compared to The Cake Mix Doctor, I'd buy that one instead, on pictures alone. With over 150 recipes in Cake Mix Magic, there are only 11 pictures of the cakes, and no decorating ideas or tips.	2002-10-10

Decorative Touches by Tombi Peck is a creative and imaginative approach to gum paste flower sprays for cakes. This book encompasses weddings, christenings, Mother's Day, and a harvest cake.<br />What I appreciated most about this book is the attention to detail in the pictures. Showing how to wire a floral spray was a great way to add value to this book, and a great example of the attention to detail showed by the author. Peck also showcased her originality in the diversity of the projects presented from bonsai trees to a water lily pram.

In this picture-filled book, Herbert features over 30 original wedding cake designs.<br />Herbert features a variety of wedding cakes in this book. The techniques that she features for decorators are rolled fondant (sugarpaste), royal icing, pattern transfer, piped embroidery, color flow collars (floodwork), and frills. While the majority of cakes are coated in marzipan and sugarpaste, she also includes a cake done in buttercream and a cake covered in a white chocolate ganache. The most valuable part of the book for me was the 14 pages of templates at the back of the book. The embroidery templates are simple, classic, and elegant.<br />The strengths of this book are in the detailed instructions Herbert provides on how to reproduce these cakes. From the templates to pictures of stages of construction, these instructions are clear and well-written. All of the metrics provided have been converted to inches for decorators outside of the UK. In the Acknowledgements section, Herbert provides a list of suppliers that were used in the creation of this book. Herbert also has included 4 pages on pillars and stands featured in the book.<br />While Herbert sets the expectations of anyone using this book, it is a good resource for advanced decorators.

The book is structured into a series of reflections.<br />While the content of this slim volume possess a certain depth and academic flavor, it neglects the aspects of inspiration. Taylerson writes that inspiration is the first step in discernment for the Virgin Mary, and presumably, for Christians. This book is not written to be inspirational.

I was expecting to have my socks knocked off by their investigative reporting. That didn't happen. They threw a lot of stones, and I just don't feel like they backed enough of it up with evidence.<br />They also made their liberal bias clearly known.<br />The interviews the book did from a collegiate perspective were all done at Boston College, who has a notoriously liberal theology bent. The people they interviewed are not middle of the road liberals by any stretch of the imagination. Cardinal Law criticized BC long before they asked him not to speak at commencement.<br />It's not an even-handed approach to the scandal, which is what I was hoping for.
