In addition, these women preached even to the highest-ranking people, such as those in the British Army.<br /><br />The journals themselves do not give great detail or depth regarding the lives of Susanna Morris, Elizabeth Hudson and Ann Moore, but they do give an outline that is by all accounts adequate for the casual reader. The language, though naturally very traditional Quaker in character, is by no means difficult to read, even though it conveys very few feelings about how these women felt about what they were doing: they felt they were being inspired by the Holy Spirit to travel and said what the Holy Spirit wanted.<br /><br />These women's lives, as Margaret Hope Bacon points out, should be an inspiration for those who find difficulty combining family duties with serious work. These women, as she succintly points out, were often prophetic rebels who really refused to accept the status quo of the eighteenth century. As such, their journals are a useful read.	2004-07-17

As such, it is very important to me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that Robert Christgau scarcely makes an ideal critic for someone trying to get beyond the generally annoying music played on both commercial and noncommercial radio today. he generally fails to give the reader any idea at all as to what is good or bad about an album, with the result that real depth is completely missing from his writing when compared with almost any other critic I have read (Richie Unterberger, Joe S. Harrington, David Fricke etc. etc.). In this book, often also the focus is on the musician rather than the music, as if Christgau merely wishes to publicise music he either loves or hates.<br /><br />It is fair to say that even back in 1996 I did not agree with most of his judgements, but I was overimpressed by Christgau's actually-not-great ability.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the humour in this book is unlike any other critic, and will keep you reading long after you realise Christgau's judgements are mediocre at best. His ability to make funny connections or comparisons about every artist he talks about will make you remember him for years and years, as if he were a humorist rather than a well-respected critic.<br /><br />Interesting more than really truthful to my eyes today, but at least worth a read or two.	2004-07-14

There is very little outright lying: indeed most of the album reviews are very clearly written and do indeed provide an accurate description of the music being written about - something I wish I was able to do far better.<br /><br />However, this book's age gives it one fatal flaw: it does not understand the real impact of music over a long period. Many albums I bought on its recommendation have proved quite useless to me even if I understood the reasons (though my narrow perceptions at that time can in no way have helped me).<br /><br />Moreover, some of the albums it recommends (or at least does not condemn) would be violently condemned by critics like Joe Harrington and David Keenan whose knowledge and intelligence certainly exceeds that of those critics in this book. It is to them that I now recommend one turn for really accurate music criticism - I recommend their list to people who do not know much about msuic all the time. However, with older music I was never into back in the 1990s the book is actually more helpful and accurate due to greater hindsight, though many albums of great value were not then reissued.<br /><br />Thus, read with great caution: this is introductory, but good for that. there is better criticism - the problem is finding it and seeing for yourself.	2004-07-13

Lucretia Mott is shown to be a woman who was exceptionally capable of dealing with criticisms from the Quaker leadership of her childhood and to take up the initiative herself when she believed she was forced to by sheer injustice. All parts of her life are described quite thoroughly but lightly: there is a notable absence of over-dense writing to clutter the book.<br /><br />Whilst none of the writing is remarkably insightful because Bacon does not go into great detail (as, say, Jean McMahon-Humez does) about the realities of life in a Quaker society, the book still comes across as a good biography. If you want to know where the modern-day women's and peace movements came from, this book should be read.	2004-07-12

As Islam grows and Europe's population declines, we see the Middle East as likely due to its high fertility rates to develop into one or several major military powers that are likely to be a dangerous threat to the West.<br />Brzezinski clearly points out that the problems faced by almost every country in the West and Far East (primarily demographic but not exclusively so) means that the US, if it wishes to fight radical Islam, has no useful ally with which to do so.<br />&quot;The Choice&quot; clearly shows how militant Islam has arisen from discontent with Western influence in the Islamic world, and illustrates very clearly the various forms it has taken and the critical differences between them. We seen that radical Islam can take many forms and that it has adapted to an already-modernising Islamic world, in the process offering the only viable alternative to rampant secularism.<br />Art the same time, the author is not as despairing as he might be, shwoing that the US' being a target for radical Islamic groups means that it cannot sustain its role as a global dictator and can and must aim to change its foreign policy in order to counter these problems. he shows that at least in a few cases there is some room for accommodation between the West and the established cultures, and believes with very well-argued arguments that this is the only way to stop the world from succumbing to the very real threat of a takeover by extremist Saudi-style Islam.<br />This book, though most students will be taught to be sceptical at best because of its author, should be a keystone of understanding the problems of Islamic terrorism in the wordl today.o the very real threat of a takeover by extremist Saudi-style Islam.<br />This book, though most students will be taught to be sceptical at best because of its author, should be a keystone of understanding the problems of Islamic terrorism in the wordl today.	2004-07-12

Rather, from this perspective Russia was a completely capitalist society: the bureaucracy was a ruling class with all the consequent privileges, so that workers were not able to control what they produced and why they produced it. Its view of Stalin's counterrevolution as a direct consequence of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 will be undoubtedly challenged by less radical historians but nonetheless it is very interesting to read.<br /><br />The book also looks at how the economies of the Eastern Bloc evolved from the time of the Red Army invasions after World War II until the present, when the former state capitalist ruling classes have became private property owners. There can be no doubt from the research of the various ISO members that the history of Russia and the Eastern Bloc is one of rapid economic growth whilst labour was available followed by a gradual stagnation as labour supplies dried up.<br /><br />We see this very well in terms of economic growth rates, and also in the way in which the state capitalist regimes were forced to turn to the more dynamic market capitalist West in order to make their plant equipment and technology less outdated - with resultant vast accumulation of debt. However, this part is very repetitive and their is too little grasp of the actual events that affected the Eastern bloc during this period. The later part of the book is also rather shallow and fails to live up to the ability of the socialists to expose the capitalist system and its problems. There is also, of course, no focus on the counter-arguments against socialism.<br /><br />Still, this reprint is worthwhile given that the superior [[ASIN:0902818511 State Capitalism In Russia]] - less repetitive and better structured - shows no sign of being reprinted. Even if you firmly think socialism has failed and the dream of workers' power is never likely to be fulfilled, you should read this side of the argument to see how it views the failure of Russia under Stalin and his heirs.nt is worthwhile given that the superior [[ASIN:0902818511 State Capitalism In Russia]] - less repetitive and better structured - shows no sign of being reprinted.

Harrington's Top 100 albums (though I am obliged to state I never intended it to be so) has certainly changed the way I view music forever. No other writer is so able to convince me (admittedly nobody would ever claim I am by nature sceptical) that what he says about music is true.<br />The key to \\"Sonic Cool\\", no doubt, comes from the manner in which it shows how the origin of almost all the major threads operating in rock'n'roll today are much older than one's everyday guidebook to the topic makes you believe. \\"Sonic Cool\\" suggests that by and large, most of these trends originated from two or three great flowerings, the most important of which date from the late 1960s and the \\"punk revolution\\" of the late 1970s. It argues that ever since disco emerged at the same time as the \\"punk revolution,\\" almost all of what has charted has been manufactured, extremely derivative, totally soulless and passionless music that imitates in a highly synthesised and pre-planned style the rock of the 1960s and early 1970s. Harrington says this with language that can only be described as intense and emotional, even extreme, especially when it comes to describing the commercial music of the eighties (which I grew up with for more than twenty years).<br /><br />However, his almost apocalyptic tone about the death of rock'n'roll, whilst argued with an intelligence that is extraordinarily rare among rock critics, does unnaturally split the book into a pre-\\"punk revolution\\" period where \\"art\\" and \\"commerce\\" seemed to merge reasonably well, and a post-\\"punk revolution\\" period where they were so far apart as not only not to merge, but also to create a vast space between them. Harrington clearly has not only no use (and vast scorn) for anyone who charted in the eighties or the 1990s, but also for many quite well known artists after the \\"punk revolution\\" who never had any mainstream success.<br /><br />Among pre-\\"punk revolution\\" artists he offers an excellent, balanced focus that perhaps is much closer to the opinions of mainstream critics. In this period, he willingly praises artists who were and remain popular, and looks very closely at how rock and roll evolved when it (as he sees it) was \\"living\\" among the masses. The information about both major and minor artists is very good and worth reading, and we see that many of the well-known artists of the era were, like independent rockers of the eighties and nineties, part of large movements, which Harrington pieces together in a very logical and easy-to-understand manner that shows each movement (as he indeed does with everything about pre-\\"punk revolution\\" music) in a very precise, highly historical context that shows very clearly why everything that occurred happened as it did.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as another reviewer has said, Harrington (unlike his contemporary David Keenan) does not think highly of any artist who \\"thinks outside the box\\" ie. has an attitude or philosophy different from the attitudes of 1960s rockers. This might be why his focus in more modern times is so limited: electronica, trip-hop, post-rock, and death metal are completely excluded, the first three genres undoubtedly because their quiet, yet original, sophistication does not blend well with his train of thought. His focus from this period on riot grrl and obscure indie rock does strike one as being unbalanced, especially given that writers like Pierro Scaruffi question seriously the originality of modern garage rockers. More detail on the eighties and nineties would indeed be good even if Harrington does not want it.<br /><br />On the whole, an unbalanced book that still manages to make a na?ve reader think many times more about what music they ought to be listening to.o the opinions of mainstream critics.

We see clearly the way in which Minangkabau culture works and why it has held together as well as it has amidst such influences and Islam and modernity, as well as being shown the character of the ancient law system that still forms the heart of Minangkabau culture. The remarkable thing, as Sanday points out, is that the Minangkabau have always seamlessly blended such opposites as matriliny and Islam.<br /><br />Sanday shows exactly how the Minangkabau contrast so much with classic patrilineal cultures, most especially in the way in which women have such an important role in their culture's most important ceremonies. Throughout \\"Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy\\", she looks in very good and effective detail at how these ceremonies are carried out, and why they are so important to their own identity.<br /><br />Women in Minangkabau culture have a very important ceremonial role, despite the spiritual power of the male \\"penghulu\\", who are clearly discussed in a separate chapter. We gain a good insight into the role not only of food and land, but also of song in Minangkabau culture to show how each individual relates to the society as a whole. This is also seen in the lengthy, but reasonably clear, discussion about how Minangkabau people marry - and how this has been changed in recent decades. Sanday is so practical that she will illustrate very clearly some actual examples of modern Minangkabau people and how they have married to prevent any reader misunderstanding them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly recommended text for those interested in anthropological studies. it is clear, well-written and in no way sentimental.

Although it is fair to say that he has matured considerably with respect to the way in which he treats important issues such as Marxism, there is no doubt that this book is heavily flawed in the way in which it links Marxism and Stalinism - despite the thetoric which Noebel is so fond of quoting, many on the left deny (with good reason) that Stalin, Mao or Khrushchev have anything to do with Marxism. Moreover, why does Noebel fail to discuss fascism or secular nationalism in this context: these ideologies are certainly as hostile to Christianity as Marxism?<br /><br />The same is true with \\"Cosmic Humanism\\": whilst it is in many ways highly refreshing to see this worldview, adhered to today by a great many religious organisations, attacked with such clarity for failing to adhere in any way to traditional Christianity, Noebel does not look at where its adherents at the very least claim to draw their inspiration from: he sees \\"Cosmic Humanism\\" as perhaps rather more modern in origin that it actually is. In this process, he is far too Western-centred to really see that today there exists no concerted opposition to secular humanism outside of Australia, Red America and some developing nations, or that the most extreme form of secular humanism threaten the very future of the West as we know it.<br /><br />However, the very fact that, perhaps contrary to what most students and similar people believe, secular humanism really is not compatible with traditional Western culture and the values of Christianity is shown more effectively in this book than any place before. Noebel is, with the wisdom of age, able to show how biblical Christianity is different in many clear ways from humanistic worldviews in a way that could easily be read by the most inexperienced reader on the subject. This makes the book of considerable use for those who wish to understand why the religious right want to complain about today's society.<br /><br />Biased, one-sided, but showing an author's long-term commitment to a different society with remarkable clarity.his makes the book of considerable use for those who wish to understand why the religious right want to complain about today's society.

Her ability to compile the writings of Rebecca Jackson, one of the most famous converts to Shakerism, in such an effective manner as she did was remarkable. In that work, Humez showed a true mastery of what ought to be seen as a difficult topic.<br /><br />Although a failed postage has meant I have not been able to receive the book, \\"Mother's First-Born Daughters: Early Shaker Writings on Women and Religion\\" appears to be as good as Humez' previous work on the topic. Though it meant nothing to me when I first read it, it is fair to say that since that time I have become better able to understand the mysteries that lie at the core of Shaker life. The fact that Shakers had a quite complicated system (as Humez makes us aware) meant that their writings on spiritual topics have not been as available to a reader like me as books dealing with, say, Shaker furniture or cooking.<br /><br />Hence, this collection, when and if I get a chance to read it thoroughly, should be a revelation. The findings I have so far had about it show clearly that Humez is able to \\"get inside\\" the lives of Shaker women in a way more general studies of Shakerism never even attempt to do. She seems to be able to show more than just events within communes from 170-210 years ago in a manner that is rare even among the best-researched histories, especially in the early and late parts of the book. This appears to be very well balanced with commentaries that give the general reader some hop of understanding the text, so that in no way can it be as unreadable as I found it several years back.<br /><br />We really see and feel the religious inspiriation of the Shaker mediums, even understanding where they felt it was coming from, when we read Humez' well-edited texts. The feelings and dreams of being possessed by spirits normally seems far removed, yet here it seems totally familiar, as do other aspects of Shaker spirituality discussed in the book.<br /><br />On the whole, these texts cement Jean McMahon-Humez' status as the greatest Shaker historian. Strongly recommended, especially as none of the texts can be found in the equally impressive [[ASIN:0809123738 The Shakers: Two Centuries Of Spiritual Reflection]].

It then goes on to describe the way in which she set up these Shaker colonies and explains the qualities that allowed her to set up what was (in some ways at least) a very demanding way of life.<br /><br />What is important about this book is that it is very well-balanced and in no way can it be said that Campion was anything other than very fair in the way in which she looked at the pre-Shaker life of Ann Lee: indeed, what emphasis there is in the text tends to focus on Ann's early days as a married woman. As far as the parts dealing with Ann's life as Shaker leader, there is nothing remotely new or in any way shocking, but Campion redeems herself by the balance and fairness with which she writes about an often misunderstood subject. In addition, her writing is remarkable, compared with most books dealing with Shakers or shakerism, for the ease with which someone with no knowledge of this still-fascinating sect can read it.<br /><br />Though it merely restates well-known aspects of Shaker history, the balance and reader-friendly character of this book makes it ideal as an introduction to Shakerism for the curious.	2004-07-06

The games aim to give players lessons, but here lies the fault: although they seem to be different from game to game, it is fair to say that the differences are not nearly so great that the 100 games included cover all possible problems one might have.<br /><br />This relates to the fact that \\"The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games\\" focuses far too much on sharp tactical, attacking games and is never going to teach the aspiring player to learn all the necessary skills to become good at chess. There are very few notable endgames included in this book, and the number ofpositional masterpieces is not large either: when they do get included, it is often because direct attacks were involved to some degree in the play. This lack of strategic chess makes \\"The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games\\" deeply flawed in its selection.<br /><br />The explanation for the book's choices seems almost non-existent, though many of the games were known to me before I first read this book several years ago.<br /><br />On the whole \\"The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games\\" has a flawed and incomplete selection, but the games themselves do take a great deal of understanding that ought to strengthen most players' abilities.	2004-06-11

Essentially, whilst Strehlow does directly refer a good deal to the writings of Hildegard herself, the greater part of this book by far is concerned with his own interpretation of what there things mean for people today. Strehlow certainly believe that the charatceristic remedies proposed in Hildegard's writings - fasting, wearing rough and scratchy clothing and hard physical exercise - will solve the spiritual problems that undoubtedly do plague our culture today. The tone of the book indeed is extremely modern, even postmodern, in the manner it exaplains the body's function and relates them to the way we live our daily life in terms of quite advanced science, especially relating ot bodily chemistry such as that of free radicals.<br /><br />However, it is fair to say that the book tends to apply Hildegard's findings in a quite literal manner that moves from its generally modern character to a very different world - which Strehlow however does seem to appreciate. He manages in a quite interesting, even thought-provoking way to link up Hildegard's work to the most modern physics and biology, as well as study the findings of dietitians very clearly.<br /><br />It is fair to say though, that for all its scientific postmodernism, Strehlow is very doctrinaire, at times resembling a Vatican spokesperson. However, the book is still worthwhile reading for the way in which it illustrates a very different system of understanding both physical and spiritual disorders that plague our culture today.	2004-06-01

This contrast does mean \\"Virtuous Magic: Women Saints and Their Meanings\\" is rather over-the-place and unfocused, but the mixing of poetic stories with actual texts or simple historical facts places us much closer to the authors' perspectives than we would otherwise be.<br /><br />The book indeed does have a sense of feeling that most religious books totally lack, even if this sense is not all that deep. The joy and fear so evident is the simple yet so touching lives of these women is merely shown clearly rather than felt in most cases, so that \\"Virtuous Magic: Women Saints and Their Meanings\\" does not qualify as an outstanding book.<br /><br />For an eccentric look at the meaning of holiness, this is a good read, however.	2004-05-22

The writings are explained with a clarity that would allow even a beginner to Quakerism to understnad very clearly the character of seventeenth century England.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time many of the pitfalls undoubtedly present in modern Quakerism are utterly absent here. The theological reflection, the reflection of the presence of the sacred, is completely central throughout all these writings: this serves to ground them in a truly deep spirituality. The result is that we see exactly how the women felt they were being guided, rather than them being guided by outside sources.<br /><br />Moreover, there is more than a peek into the past in the modern-looking text of the book, and the introductions and long lists of petitioners are a delightfor the historian.<br /><br />Difficult to find (Pendle Hill have wanted to reprint it) but worth the money nonetheless.	2004-05-15

We see very clearly what kind of spiritual life these women lived and the values they considered important, as well as some interesting prayers for these women (the authors are nuns).<br /><br />The introductory part of the book is rather repetitive but nonetheless does fit the purpose of the work, showing how pre-Christian Celtic society gave women a status they have rarely obtained in the history of civilised society.<br /><br />Because it contains some hard-to-find information, this is a worthy resource even if not all of it is new.	2004-05-03

There is always a clear understanding of what the players were doing throughout each game in the tournament, and its progress is monitored much more closely than any simple book on chess history or even many previous books I have read on World Championship matches.<br /><br />There is also an excellent section dealing with the background to the tournament and how the contestants were expected to perform - and how they did.<br /><br />An impressive document, easy to read despite the outdated (but familiar to me) descriptive notation used to make the reprint more affordable. Excellent investment for anybody interested in Chess.	2004-05-03

As to how good the choice of games is it is most difficult for me to judge, but many of them were already familiar to me from reading on Chess as a child.<br /><br />What really makes this book by no means ideal to increase one's knowledge of chess, however, is the fact that none of the many games included are annotated or analysed with anything like enough detail to permit the casual reader with little time on his/her hands to understand exactly what went on during the course of these games. Thus, the games feel to the reader who knows anything about Chess to be merely recorded. Never is analysis of critical moves or mistakes given with an understanding of alternative routes the games shown could have taken. What annotation exists does little for the games at all.<br /><br />On the whole, this is more a collection of games than a book, and can best be described as of moderate value only.	2004-04-14

The fact that the whole book is focused so much on specific positions means that there is no likelihood that one will ever work out how on earth Fischer (or any other famous player) could manage to reach any single one of the positions discussed. Doing this is the only way to learn to play chess at all well!<br /><br />The problems, on the whole, assume very little knowledge of chess and allow for very easy answers with a small amount of knowledge. Even the supposedly \\"more complicated\\" problems give no difficulty to any grown-up person who knows the rules of Chess. The positions from Fischer's games, except the excellently described rook sacrifice against Sherwin, lack any insight into his style of play, thus giving one no knowledge of why so many people see Fischer as the greatest Chess player who ever lived.<br /><br />Only for kids.	2004-04-12

The book is based on the quite reasonable (even obvious) fact that Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, evangelical Protestantism and Islam share a strong and uncompromising rejection of the tenants of the sexual revolution of the 1960s. All these religions have been extremely strong in demanding traditional roles for women (no religious authority), no permission for extramaritial sex or homosexuality, and a strong tendency to demand fidelity of loving partners. In addition, these religions share a general rejection of such countercultural trends as illicit drug use, freedom in artistic expression, and \\"new age\\" spirituality.<br /><br />Kreeft is most effective in the manner in which he shows some very obvious facts, such as how the media and arts which influence our children are extremely biased against traditional religions. He indeed does this in a manner that ought to be capable of impresing anybody with an interest in religion.<br /><br />However, the whole problem with every thesis done by any Catholic apologist like Peter Kreeft is the way in which they assume that the laws of the Church over the centuries are in any way natural. A look at secular sources, especially those of Marx or anarchist theorists, will show clearly how the laws that have governed and continue to govern the Catholic and Orthodox churches served to protect the power of the ruling classes. This was seen in the way the Church defended ruling classes in countries like Russia and Spain throughout the twentieth century, and may have contributed to their demise through the West (except in Australia and Red America where religion remains strong).<br /><br />The societal changes brought about by industrialisation were bound in most places to lead to such events as the sexual revolution, whose ideas were spread long before the 1960s. Increasing violence in society, whatever one interprets its cause, is most likely what leads many people into forms of music like metal or rap or grunge. No matter how distasteful they really are, these forms of music have little to do with the increasing violence, though this book will make one think it self-evident that they do - when poverty and lack of opportunities are probably leading many into these forms of music.<br /><br />Though well-argued, the assumption in \\"Ecumenical Jihad\\" (or any other book of religious apologetics) are dubious.

In these Eastern European nations, the Red Army installed new regimes that were completely subservient to the orders of Moscow - involving trials and murders of all dissidents and the development of a military industrial complex, which the radical left had always wanted to overthrow. Under such conditions their support of marxism was very questionable.<br /><br />\\"State Capitalism In Russia\\" (originally written as \\"The Nature Of Stalinist Russia\\") deals with exceptional clarity with the argument of Trotsky that Russia was still a Marxian workers' state because the property was nationalised.<br /><br />Cliff was simple and forceful in his argument that a complete counterrevolution had occurred in Russia during the 1920s when Stalin rose to power. He shows using available government statistics that whilst most resources up to Stalin's triumph in the 1920s were devoted to improving the living standards of the Russian masses, from the time of the Five-Year Plans, all these resources were transferred into the hands of the bureaucracy. As Cliff sees it, this bureaucracy accumulated vast resources through exploitation of the Russian working class, in the process building a military-industrial complex that aimed directly to compete with market capitalist nations in the West for production of the most powerful weapons. Stalin saw this as the only way to protect the USSR, but in fact the only way a socialist regime could have survived was via the overthrow of the Western ruling classes and seizure of their vast internationally accumulated profits.<br /><br />Cliff shows clearly how much better off for wages the Russian masses were under Lenin than under either the Tsar or Stalin and, as a prerequisite for this, how much higher a proportion of production was devoted to consumer rather than capital goods under Lenin.<br /><br />At the same time, Cliff clearly shows how oriented Russian laws were to protecting the power of the bureaucratic ruling class. A perfect example is the exceptionally regressive turnover tax system, which the radical left have likened to the tzxes in developed nations on consumption that disproportionately affect the poor. Marxism advocated the use of steeply progressive taxes on income and inheritance and abolishing all indirect taxation.<br /><br />Cliff is similarly clear about how his theory of state capitalism explains what had actually occurred in Eastern Europe since 1945: new ruling classes had been established on the Soviet model by parties merely calling themselves \\"Communist\\": workers had no control over the means of production.<br /><br />Cliff's theory of state capitalism explains the Soviet ruling class' actions in the years after World War II very well because understanding the bureaucracy as a capitalist ruling class explains their desire to compete with the West. Cliff is also very clear in his view that only a genuine workers' revolution could produce a genuine socialist system where the needs of the masses take precedence over the enrichment of the wealthy.<br /><br />Many reader, however, find the idea of Lenin's Russia as a model for workers' liberation dubious.<br /><br />Whilst Cliff does clearly demonstrate major differences between Lenin's and Stalin's Russia (so do mainstream historians), the view that socialism eliminated chivalry in warfare is interpreted very differently on the right - that Lenin himself with the Cheka eliminated it. the size of the Cheka, according to Soviet archives, was so large that claims by the radical left that the Whites were responsible for the carnage of the Russian Civil War are dubious. This in itself makes claims of Stalini's counterrevolution less clear than Tony Cliff himself would like them to be. It also makes one question whether Leninism was the model for workers' power I was taught it was as a young student at Melbourne University.<br /><br />This is a very good book, but it's claims really need to be tested against evidence from a truly opposing side - and the mainstream centre never does that.be tested against evidence from a truly opposing side - and the mainstream centre never does that.	2003-12-21

These groups seemed to offer a perspective of history completely different from what I learned in school and I lapped it up for many years, even to the extent of writing about \\"class struggle\\" in my lecture notes when the topic was not mentioned!<br /><br />One thesis that attratced me was that the \\"socialist\\" nations were not socialist at all, but capitalist like the West. This was argued by [[ASIN:0906224446 Tony Cliff]] to be true of all \\"Communist\\" nations after Lenin died. They use arguments based upon Marx's series of class to see the Communist Party bureaucracies as ruling classes like big business owners in the West.<br /><br />\\"The Mandate Of Heaven\\", however, makes no effort to study why China was or was not socialist. Instead, we see a very vague study of Chinese history over many centuries in an effort to see Mao as the successor to the many dynasties into which pre-1911 Chinese history was divided. Whilst there is some focus on those aspects of Chinese society that led many in the 1960s to see Mao's police state as a model for socialism (communes, the \\"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\\") none of \\"The Mandate Of Heaven\\" is likely to convince a sceptic of the reality that China has never been socialist. Rather, it will confuse people as to the true nature of Mao's police state. Sceptics of socialism, as I was before entering university (and to some extent now after reading a broader range of viewpoints) will never be convinced that there is anything valuable in socialism.<br /><br />I really cannot recommend this confused book, even for those who really must have firm faith in the radical left despite their many personal and to a lesser extent ideological problems.y personal and to a lesser extent ideological problems.	2003-12-21

For instance, Hagee says that Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan and North Korea were the countries responsible for the September 11 terrorist attacks. In cold reality, it was wealthy oil sheikhs and the Muslim monarchies of the Persian Gulf who funded and fund al-Qa'ida and the September 11 attacks. The CIA indeed built al-Qa'ida as a a fanatical bulwark (unrivalled in strength due to Saudi oil money) against the threat of Soviet Russia.<br /><br />The US government denies this merely to hide its supports for extremely anti-democratic governments that might threaten their access to Middle eastern petroleum. Hagee comes off as an apologist for a government concerned merely with protecting the wealth and power of vested interests.<br /><br />The later parts of the book are focused on typical themes of fundamentalist Christianity and are equally absurd in themselves. For one thing, paganism is not in itself responsible for the alleged problems of marriage breakdowns, promiscuous sexuality, abortion, violence among children etc. For another, Muslim terrorists' focus on the supposed decay in moral standards in American society has been advocated by others but is not clear when one compared the US with other developed nations which have much higher rates of (say) divorce and cohabitation. Hence claiming that  legalisation of homosexuality and abortion (etc.) caused the September 11 attacks is pure propaganda.<br /><br />The last part of the book goes even further from reality with another classic claim of fundamentalist preachers repeated: the \\"new world order\\" which in reality is a natural consequence of the development of capitalism and the competition between capitalists. The \\"one world government\\" claim really is a classic claim of US nationalists.<br /><br />Not recommended if you want a decent look at September 11.pure propaganda.

Frances explains easliy that gift drawings and gift songs gave Shaker women direct contact with the Spirit, which was characteristic of the earliest Believers but was lost during the early nineteenth century when Shakerism expanded. It is also show that the type of mediumship found in Shakerism is actually seen even today in native religions of the world.<br /><br />The majority of \\"Heavenly Visions: Shaker Gift Drawings and Gift Songs\\", however, consists of some most beautiful pictures that show Shaker art of the period known as \\"Mother Ann's Work\\". The pictures are often much more beautiful and much more clearly laid out than those in less detailed studies of Shakerism and the book is made into an important purchase.<br /><br />The actual pictures show there to be a great deal of structure and reason behind the gifts given to Shaker mediums during the 1840s and 1850s, as well as illustrating Shakerism's unique spiritual character. We find that there were many pictures of key Shaker leaders from the early period, and also a strong emphasis on the basic necessities of the natural world in the content of Shaker gift drawings.

Soule, flows very well and gives good detail of the key aspects of Shaker life throughout the nineteenth century. The first writings are a testimony to how Shaker community served to give experience of the Divine to each Believer and direction to his/her life. There is an excellent description of Joseph Meacham's viewpoint of how Shakerism relates to the life of Christ, and there are several other simple but effective sources later in the book.<br /><br />The next section deals with the way in which Shakers lived out their lives within the context of the Gospel and how Shaker theology was related to the ideal of Christ and Wisdom of earlier sects. Indeed, the whole chapter shows Shaker theology possessed a mystical spirit vased on the idea of the Light of God and the discernment of spirits. This areas shows how Shakers taught \\"to make the way of God their occupation\\" and how Shaker writers believed themselves illuminated by the divine Spirit.<br /><br />The third chapter \\"Sharing The Christlife\\" turns the focus away from theological matters to practical Shakerism and the observation of a religious life. Here we see the character of celibate communalism that was a fundamental Shaker doctrine and how the interests of each Believer must be the interest of all. Shakers felt the Spirit led them into this order, and in the fourth chapter we see a return to theological reflection. Because Shakerism believed God to have both male and female attributes (Ann Lee was seen as the Second Coming by believers), this part focuses on the role of Christ, and simple description of the birth and life of Christ are most effective to see Shakerism's connection to the Peace Churches of the Reformation.<br /><br />This part is more difficult to read than the relatively unchallenging earlier parts, but illustrates the manner by which Shakerism was effective in developing the humanity of Christ in a way rarely seen since the first millennium. There is a lengthy treatise on historical redemption that illustrates Mother Ann's historical role, and on the dual nature of the Godhead and Trinity. The last two chapters focus on the role of spiritual gifts in Shakerism that served to enhance their lives beyond rigid routine. The gift of peace, unity, and simplicity so evident in Shakerism during the nineteenth century are put out impressively throughout these parts. Written in touching mystical language, they show Shakers as people possessed of a truly joyful spirit.<br /><br />Focusing on as many Shaker writers as possible, the book gives a very good understanding of who these people were and how they evolved during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Rather than becoming incongruent, the use of many authors illustrates the communal spirit of the Shakers.<br /><br />An impressive historical resource.in developing the humanity of Christ in a way rarely seen since the first millennium.

It explains it very clearly in terms of the roots of Wahhabi Islam that tend to see non-Muslims as polytheists. In some cases, Wahhabis have tended to see even other sects of Islam in these terms.<br /><br />Many people in the West today are aware of the structure of life in Saudi Arabia. Non-Muslims cannot practice or proclaim their religion on pain of death; women are severely restricted both in dress and in opportunities - they are not allowed to drive and must be accompanied by a male relative on a bus or train (though not on flights); and cinema, theatre and Western music are likewise banned.<br /><br />What Dore Gold does in \\"Hatred's Kingdom: How Saudi Arabia Supports the New Global Terrorism\\" is to show very clearly the manner in which Saudi support for terrorism today is rooted in the ideas of Wahhab in the eighteenth century - which called for a return to the Islam of the first Muslims. \\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" gives very easy-to-read accounts of what the Wahhabis believed had corrupted Islam since the seventh century and how the Wahhabis believed Islam should be returned to the basic belief in the oneness of God.<br /><br />This, they felt, meant that Judaism and Christianity had to be attacked as unbelief. More often, actually, Wahhabis have seen these religions as polytheism, and have attacked them viciously in their propaganda with quotes from the Qur'an.<br /><br />We see very clearly how the Wahhabi armies of ibn Saud fought the Ottomans over several centuries to gain control of the Hijaz from the Hashmites (who rule Jordan today), succeeding after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />The oil wealth of Saudi Arabia in later years meant that the 'ulama and government could carry out Wahhab's original intention of spreading his form of Islam across the whole world, which we see has led to the setting up of large numbers of Wahhabi schools in the West and the conversion of many young people to Islam.<br /><br />Wahhabism was/is the toughest and most reliable defence for the US against potential left-wing revolution in the Middle East, owing to its uncompromising belief in murdering opponents thereof. Thus, the US government has strongly backed Saudi Arabia ever since oil was found in the Persian Gulf. The crux really is that Wahhabism believes it has an obligation to fight the Dar-al-Harb (non-Wahhabis, especially non-Muslims) regardless of the means used. This explains both why the US trained Osama Bin Laden against the Afghan PDPA in the 1980s and why Osama felt threatened by the placement of US troops on Saudi soil. It also explains why Muslim terrorists believe it is neither suicide nor terrorism to sacrifice one's life as a human bomb if one kills infidels in the process.<br /><br />The book is especially clear at showing why many attempts at modernisation by Saudi monarchs are firmly opposed by the 'ulama and how the 'ulama have considerable control over Saudi politics. Over the last thirty years, the 'ulama have in fact become vocal in their demands for an even stricted Islamic state in Saudi Arabia, and have in fact succeeded in tightening many regulations governing Saudi life. The whole book is clear in showing that Saudi 'ulama aim to spread Wahhabism globally by jihad, and how 'ulama see it as the highest goal of every Muslim to die in a jihad. Indeed, they point out that Wahhabism basically believes that nonbelievers have no right to live whatsoever. 'ulama and Saudi princes thus contribute vast sums of money to fuding such groups as al-Qa'ida, leading to such horrors as the September 11 attacks.<br /><br />Dore Gold points out the only by finding a substitute to lessen dependence on Saudi oil can the US solve the problem its alliance with a state built on an ideology of holy war has created for it since the September 11 attacks.<br /><br />In summary, an extremely clear book that offers a very good understanding of where Muslim terrorism comes from.terrorism comes from.	2003-10-11

The anglophone democracies in fact wanted Jews no more than the Nazis themselves, did and influential right-wing religious leaders, especially in the US, used biblical arguments for the persecution of Jews. These ravings meant that many ordinary working class people in the UK, US and Canada saw Jews as much more a threat than the Nazis!<br /><br />Politicians in the West, worse still, actively supported Hitler's policies, and ‘The Holocaust Conspiracy’ gives many examples of rulers in the UK, US, Canada and Australia showing their active admiration for Hitler. However, the book breaks down here. William Perl is totally unwilling to understand the real reason for their support of the Nazis: that Western governments were desperate to crush the power of the union movement and Communist parties who could have easily threatened their very rationale for existence via Communist or anarchist revolution. The Nazis did this in the most efficient way possible: by banning socialist parties and trade unions as soon as they established power. British, American, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand ruling classes would have similarly banned socialist parties had fear of retaliation become absent.<br /><br />The later part of ‘The Holocaust Conspiracy’ relates to the planned extermination of the Jews by Palestinians in the Middle East – which is more of a threat now than ever, and Perl does not fail to recognise what such groups as Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been planning, leading to his important conclusion that another Jewish Holocaust could easily happen. Here, though, no mention is made of Western support to Muslim fundamentalists to protect Western interests (eg. radical Islamic groups against the PDPA in Afghanistan), nor the role of radical Islamic ideologies such as Wahhabism.<br /><br />Nor at any point did Perl mention Trostkyite groups, who campaigned for a complete removal of restrictions on Jewish immigration. Such a move would have instantly saved six million lives in Europe and countless more killed by the Israel/Palestine conflict in the Middle East.<br /><br />A shocking revelation on how Western governments supported Hitler and aided his genocide, but does overlook many of the motivations behind their policies.now than ever, and Perl does not fail to recognise what such groups as Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been planning, leading to his important conclusion that another Jewish Holocaust could easily happen.

One sees that at the beginning of her career Rebecca, a black women from Philadelphia, was a part of the Methodist Episcopal Church in her youth and was involved in \\"Holiness\\" prayer meetngs during the 1820s.<br /><br />This part of her career is particularly interesting for the way in which we see that Rebecca, as a result of the Holiness movement's highly participatory nature, was able to write down detailed visions of the coming of Heaven and the Day Of Judgement. These are blended in a facinating way with imagery taken from a woman's everyday life in Jackson's time. Many of her early visions realted closely to Jesus's miracles, but there was also many dreams of such mundane things as quilts, cakes, rain, and deaths of her relatives. Rebecca's writing style was immediate, dramatic, and intensely touching.<br /><br />Later, she decribed the strains preaching was having on her married life as she moved into intense prayer as Methodists criticised her ministry as a black woman preaching a false doctrine. In response, we see that Jackson focused clearly and sincerely on trying to live the life of Jesus, especially after visiting the Shakers in 1836.<br /><br />The next part of \\"Gifts Of Power\\" deals with the way in which Rebecca, though troubled, found the Shakers. This part of the book is mystical in focus, but is really close to the heart and passionate about how Rebecca's conversion to Shakerism was really based on spiritual visions and dreams stemming from her experience with other Sisters at Watervliet. Her actual entry is likened, indeed, to the Resurrection of Jesus in fiery, yet simple language, and McMahon-Humex does a wonderful job of explaining exactly what Rebecca Jackson was doing in these densely narrated pages.<br /><br />As a Shaker, Rebecca Jackson did not cede that mystical, fiery character of her early writings, but her later writings have an epic tone lacking in previous letters. She saw during her residence at Watervliet a desite to do missionary work among blacks, which is seen in visions of herself travelling long distances or of the arrival of Native American seeking help. Later still, Jackson appeared to be able to see the whole of the globe, and she described her desperation in explicit and dramatic tones, notable during her brother's last illness.<br /><br />In Philadelphia, Jackson's drams became focused on early events in her life, and she would dream of being united with her brother as she went on a long pilgrimate to develop a Shaker community for blacks. Her work during her second residence at Watervliet and with the Philadelphia Shakers was indeed seen by her as \\"going to Zion\\", in terms that make one clearly understand what she saw of herself like few other texts of this type. She saw herself as revealing the Kngdom of Heaven in her labours with the people of Philadelphia, and she never was afraid to conceal her feelings through her life.<br /><br />Jean McMahon-Humez adds fitting notes that make unraveling and interpreting the texts very easy. I do not find that these notes detract in any way from the fiery, yet touching quality of Rebecca's texts - and the glossaries make \\"Gifts Of Power\\" a true historical documents. \\"Gifts Of Power\\" is a must-read for those interested in women's biographies.language, and McMahon-Humex does a wonderful job of explaining exactly what Rebecca Jackson was doing in these densely narrated pages.<br /><br />As a Shaker, Rebecca Jackson did not cede that mystical, fiery character of her early writings, but her later writings have an epic tone lacking in previous letters.

The book uses interviews from young musicians of the 1990s to illustrate the impact each group has had. However, the book does aim basically for obscure influences on well-known groups.<br /><br />The book is one the whole clearly structured and gives very good detail of all the subjects concerned, with no single band being promoted at the expense of any other since each is almost (if not with perfect conscience) given the same space, we clearly see how popular and famous groups were able to use these bands. The histories would be seen by some as scanty, but on most of these groups (excessively so with some) there is adequate additional information from present-day websites. However, nobody could believe the histories have any comprehensive charcter about them because and the bands' music is never explained in the detail that a prospective listener would wish for. Hence, the curious listener is left with an empty feeling.<br /><br />The book, however, is very clear in explaining, with an extremely light tone, the impact of the various movements of noncommercial music had before college radio exposed bands that commercial stations would never play. It even discusses bands like the Swans who could not get much exposure from college radio. The book has a good sense of history lacking in some comprehensive texts of this type.<br /><br />The major \\"absentee\\" from the book is a look at the impact of ancient, especially medieval, music on modern rock bands - this is to some degree a repeat of Richie Unterberger. The book for this reason fails to look at women in rock beyond the \\"riot grrls\\" of the 1990s and bands that influence them (such as Beat Happenning).<br /><br />Despite that fatal flaw, the book is a very good reference work.	2003-07-13

Barber to illustrate how both the tribalism of Islmic and other fundamentalisms and the globalising effect of turbo-capitalism today involving huge super-rich corporations controlling vast monopolies throughout the world are opposed to a healthy democracy.<br /><br />The book begins with a study of the way in which, since the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989, there has been a major advance by large corporations into these and other countries as a result of policies in the imperialist nations of privatisation and deregulation of essential services. The book also shows how even in the few remaining Stalinist regimes (supposedly opposed to the kind of globalisation represented by McWorld) there has been this kind of spread. Even the most traditional groups are turning to Western technology as the super-rich banks aim to gain larger and larger profits through more efficient businesses after the end of the long postwar capitalist boom.<br /><br />This \\"turbo-capitalism\\" is shown up in the next part of the book to be merely a revival of classical laissez-faire capitalism which views everything from the perspective of the market. The book then focuses on the problems created today by the vast demand for profits by super-rich corporations in terms of dependence by imperialist nations on other countries for their ruling classes' key resources: oil, aluminium, copper, lead etc. Here it is stated that autarky as promoted in the US has never been an option for mineral-poor nations - and that many nations in sub-Saharan Africa will remain terminally poor due to lack of good soils or mineral wealth. With oil, the story is worse because of the threat of Islamic fundamentalism.<br /><br />Barber then discusses superficially - with no opinions made - the way in which the manufacturing sector has been globalised to increase profits, and then he discusses how the imperialist nations have used the mystique of popular performers and brands used by leading international sportsmen in the US to spread American culture (sometimes modified) all over the globe. However, it is impossible for the working classes to actually achieve the status of the performers super-rich corporations are marketing - Barber does a good job here of explaining the way advertisers attract ingnorant consumers and reap obscene profits. Barbers then turns to the service sector, where he explains clearly how globalised services deliver to the ruling classes of the world, through a globalised media in one language. This is extended with satellite TV and literature.<br /><br />Barber then turns to the frenzy of media mergers and monopoly - which he rightfully points out as leading effectively to a censored media as most independent newspapers developed during the long capitalist boom become swallowed up by highly monopolised presses. Here Barber shows the increased extent of mergers to produce a vast international capitalist media.<br /><br />The part dealing with the sectarian \\"Jihad\\" that has emerged in recent years is, however, not very well done because it does not explain the way in which the sectarian groups now prominent in America evolved - in part, though their support for capitalist policies. The description of separatist movements in Canda is also superficial, but in China Barber is more effective at explaining how the Stalinist regime has not dealt with Westernisation. The chapter on islamic fundamentalism can also be described as a failure because it does not seriously look at the historical aspects of Islamic extremeism - nor at their acts in recent years.<br /><br />In the last part of the book Barber discusses how a parochial opposition to the capitalist system (like that of guerillas in the developing countries) can offer no real opposition. He does logically see laissez-fair capitalism as opposed to genuine democracy, and he sees little hope in traditional state institutions, but hecannot see ordinary people's struggles to smash capitalism in the imperialist countries as a solution - rather, Barber tries to rely on civil society to provide regulations. However, there is ample evidence from history that to challenge environmental degradation and the concentration of wealth a movement to abolish capitalism and the free market and through the mass struggle of ordinary people in every country - leading in the end to social ownership of all means of production - is the only real challenge to McWorld and Jihad.<br /><br />On the whole, well thought-out but fails to look at every aspect of the situation. Barber does not grasp the possibilities explored by radical internationalist politics, nor the history of the movements in vogue today.cannot see ordinary people's struggles to smash capitalism in the imperialist countries as a solution - rather, Barber tries to rely on civil society to provide regulations.

It suggested that Lenin began the plans of mass murder perfected under Stalin as soon as he came to power. \\"The Black Book Of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression\\" aims to show that this cycle of repression, mass murder and even famine has been repeated everywhere that Communist parties have come to power.<br /><br />The book looks in great detain at the Soviet Union and how, from the time of the Civil War, Lenin and Stalin were always using secret police in order to remove opponents of the regime - backed up by decrees. The book moves in detail - though not too hard to read - through the 1922 and 1933 famines and into the Great Purge (Yezhovschina) of the late 1930s. It also shows that in fact there were many rebellions in the forced labour camps - inevitably put down by violence. The book also shows that the Comintern - formed in the 1920s to spread the Russian Revolution - used guerilla warfare constantly in nations neighbouring the Soviet Union in the effort to spread revolution. We shockingly see how anarchists and Trotskyists fighting fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain were murdered by Stalin when they escaped to Russia.<br /><br />After Russia, the book moves on to Eastern Europe, where the regimes brutally crushed opposition and also had extensive quarrels within the parties. In these we find shockingly that policies had nothing to do with which leaders Stalin and his heirs wished to eliminate - rather they were eliminated based on their background and work experience, which varied from country to country. The detail here is very good, except for Yugoslavia and Albania where it should have been more extensive - though Yugoslavian archives remain inaccessible, whilst Albanian archives can barely have been studied.<br /><br />Next there are excellent studies of the Maoist regimes in China and Cambodia, where we see mass murder through the desire to form vast peasant communes. The Great Leap Forward lead to a disastrous famine, and the Khmer Rouge's forced relocation was just as appalling. North Korea is shown to have organised purges on a scale not rivalled even in Russia, whist regimes in Africa and Latin America are shown to have established similar institutions - concentration camps, secret police, and vast guerilla networks.<br /><br />However, the book is fatally flawed in several important ways. Most importantly, it fails utterly to notice that a great deal of the violence of these regimes relates to the desire of imperialist ruling classes to crush Marxism. These imperialist ruling classes have armed Muslim fundamentalists (including Osama Bin Laden) in Afghanistan and the contras against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Crimes listed as committed by Afghan Communists or the Sandinistas were, in the main, actually the work of imperialist counterrevolutionary forces. In Russia, the Whites killed as many people as the Cheka, whilst the US military's behaviour in Vietnam is well-known, as is US support for brutal anticommunist dictators like Suharto and Mobutu Sese Seko, who were at least as murderous as Kim Il Sung and Enver Hoxha.<br /><br />Moreover, Trotskyist and anarchist arguments that the regimes condemned in this book are state capitalist are not even mentioned, in spite of the fact that the authors do admit that in fact it was the workers and peasants who suffered most from the dictators' power. In the case of North Korea the writers show very clearly how hierarchical North Korean society actually is with its strata from the Kim family through the bureaucracy to Party rank and file downwards - quite in contrast to Marx's theory of classless society. Trotskyists and anarchists ought to be taken seriously by anybody wishing to assess communism - and I recommend that you read their writings carefully.<br /><br />Interesting, but looks at only one perspective.	2003-06-18

Most of the focus is on the southeastern areas of the continent, but that does not manage to detract from the book's ability to convey understanding of what went on in traditional Native American life.<br /><br />The language is very easy to read and logical, making this very good reading fo a beginner. Indeed, there is almost no technical terminology in thw whole book.<br /><br />The early part of Tooker's book is devoted to a study of the cosmological viewpoint of the various tribes mentioned in the book. The book shows very clearly how, from the perspective of the Native American tribes, and how myth describe events in the \\"sky world\\" ie. the world above Earth. The Winnebago tribe do not base the existence of spirits on sight and hearing, but in terms of what is felt.<br /><br />The last two-thirds of \\"Native North American Spirituality Of The Eastern Woodlands\\" deals with actual Native American rituals. In very clear language, stages of long ritual are described in a way that even a novice on this subject will always be able to understand. At the same time, the rituals are explained very well, with purpose of even such actions as the sluaghtering of deer being well-explained. There is a particularly moving description of what a Winnebago father will teach his child how to reach their \\"destination\\" on a spiritual quest via fasting and helping one's fellow men. There are also accounts of offerings of tobacco and other drugs.<br /><br />On the whole, this work should be read by all interested in Native American spirituality, especially if you have little knowledge.	2003-06-08

Though I have no knowledge about whether the book is historically accurate, it is a clear story and very logically written.<br />We see how Julian (known as Katherine or Kate before she became an anchoress in Norwich church) was affected by the outbreaks of bubonic plague which killed both her young children and her husband when she was very young. We then see that she had doubts whether becoming an anchoress was what God intended for her, but that she did overcome what was the most difficult decision of her life to enter into a life of prayer.<br /><br />All through, we notice how emotional Julian and the people around her are, despite the theological view of anger as sinful. This is especially true when it becomes known (late in the book) that England is at a war with France only for the needs of the king. We also see that Julian overcomes her psychological problems to write down the visions she has very clearly - and the fact that a large number of people actually visited her in the anchorhold.<br /><br />In addition to the war with France, the novel contains some information about the Lollards in its later passages. We see Julian as someone willing, in fact, to think respectfully about issues in the outside world.<br /><br />A very interesting tale - easy to read for those who would never get through a theological work.	2003-05-26

Rather, it is written as a journey through Julian's thought and Upjohn uses highly symbolic language to title each chapter, so that the reader has to read intensely to find meaning in the book.<br /><br />However, the analysic of the teachings Julian makes is, if you are able to make your way into the language, very deep and profound. Sheila Upjohn has a very good understanding of the way in which Julian thought and gives the reader this in full depth. Each chapter follows quite logically so that there is a very good sense of cohesion - welcome for the student who does not know much about what Julian taught. There are some perspective on how her teachings fit into history, but only just enough to avoid the problem of historically isolating her work.<br /><br />On the whole, most interesting, even if it will not be what you expect. This book is a very deep spiritual analysis that may not appeal to some.	2003-04-03

However, his book is not by any means what its title would suggest. Most of it is a rehash of \\"Papal Sin\\" and is often even stronger in tone - not necessarily a bad thing, but by no means useful.<br /><br />It is true that we manage to learn a few things that were not discussed in the book \\"Papal Sin\\", but they are facts that are not by any means novel to students of the papacy. Even the serious and sensible \\"liberal\\" doubts about Leo XIII's papacy I have heard before, and the only thing remotely interesting - for the future at least - is his quote of Joseph Raztzinger about how the existence of priestesses in pre-Christian religions precludes the question of female ordination in the Catholic Church. However, his description of how lacking in holiness and ethics most Popes have been is a terrible rehash.<br /><br />After Wills moves beond the Modernist crisis, he looks at the current Church in the typical \\"progressive\\" manner, thinking in a stupid way that there will be further liberal reforms after John Paul II. However, it is clear that liberal reforms have caused irrepairable declines in mainline Protestant churches because these churches have become clearly too worldly and secular - the papacy is right on this count. In fact, as a recent student of personality theory it is easy to see that religion and conservatism are closely linked.<br /><br />The way John Paul has used his power to prevent any discussion of female ordination actually is unlike anything seen before, and those won over to Christianity today are those who want a solid tradition and something antithetical to the \\"free sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\\" culture that developed in the 1960s. Many studies do suggest only highly orthodox faith can give an abundant and meaningful life, whilst most others are recognising the shallowness of trying to adapt secular conventions to Christianity and the consequences.<br /><br />Wills argues that theologians censured by the CDF since 1979 might become thinkers for a new revolution. The 2005 conclave and its clear result showed Wills' idea as total fantasy, especially given trends since \\"Ordinatio Sacerdotalis\\". The many theologians censured by the Wojtyla papacy will be forgotten and forever relegated to the realm of secular academia and specialised historical scholarship. Wills' arguments about what Catholicism is really do not make sense in the light of the attitude of Cardinals like Ratzinger and Sch&ouml;nborn, nor with demographic trends whereby conservative Catholics will take over wherever it is affordable to maintain their traditions in a rigorous manner.<br /><br />What one might say is that, given that mainline Protestantism clearly is dying, Wills wants a Church that has a viable future, and at the same time to be able to think freely, but that is the utterest impossibility because the deep emotional ties required by religious faith will necessarily exclude the kind of social structures that allow (eg) for the ordination of women or even debate thereon.

She certainly is right in that the teachings of radical feminism are contrary to those of traditional Catholicism. She does not consider the way in which veneration of Mary has - actually with considerable truth - been compared with that of ancients goddesses these feminists aim to revive. this fact undoubtedly explains some considerable part of the reason for the affinity between the two groups. Nor does she consider what many people - even if suspicious of the repressive nature of the Vatican's structure - admire about Catholic worship and spirituality.<br /><br />Another thing she left out - badly - was the fact that even when \\"Ungodly Rage\\" was being written there was a great deal being done in the Vatica (eg against Matthew Fox) to end these trends. the way Steichen writes it, nothing was being done by Ratzinger and his aids at all. Rather she focuses on what ordinary Catholics can do - which is a very worthwile thing if one was in her position, but in this case at least looks at only one side.<br /><br />Maybe I am rather harsh at this moment, but this book, for all its clarity, is arguably the most extreme work I have ever read on any topic. If you think Ann Coulter's a \\"pit bull terrier\\", read Donna Steichen.	2003-03-05

To put it bluntly, it is disturbing for those who are familiar with secular court cases to know how ecclesiastical systems work. The defendant has no right of appeal and is rarely able to present a coherent case - even if they do, those within the Vatican itself have to assess it. Lest anybody whatsoever think this will change in the future, the inquisitorial attitude of the Wojtyla papacy is certain to intensify throughout the 21st century, as shown by the result of the 2005 conclave.<br /><br />Of themselves, the accounts are by no means anything special, and they do not look clearly at how to use the Magisterium or what it can actually offer to society: I have, to be honest, discovered since originally reviewing the book that there is much to offer society in Churhc teaching even if I do retain scepticism thereof. Many outstanding people understand that the controversial teaching iof the Vatican do have value, but this of course is never considered here.<br /><br />The book is reasonable, clear, if disturbing, but it leaves one with a feeling of lacking an understanding of those (believe it or not, mostly laity) who report such deviations in doctrine to the Vatican. Often these are very simple, caring, compassionate people whose lives can tell a great deal about real people.<br /><br />Hard to rate, and maybe my revision is rather harsh, but this book can often seem embarrasing for me with hindsight.	2003-03-05

The book, like all Catholic apologetics, is an argument against liberalism within the Church and argues that highly successful attempts by the Vatican to root out dissent from its teachings have been proved necessary. He looks fairly thoroughly at how this happens, but perhaps does not understand the control the Vatican actaully has always had over eg. the appointment of bishops. Whilst I certainly can agree wholeheartedly that the is an extremely severe danger of any institution like the Church having a worldly outlook, there is a serious danger that possible corruption and abuse within the hierarchy will never be criticised in the future.    Gilchrist's criticism is sensible, but he overstates it because he seems never to be satisfied with what the Vatican has done to push theologians and religious into line. My own lack of scepticism precludes me from assessing whether this effect will prove beneficial. All I know is that John Paul II's actions will be what governs the Catholic Church as long as it exists.    Worth reading if you are a really faithful Catholic.	2003-03-04

Whilst \\"Rome Or The Bush\\" established quite reasonable concerns about the Catholic Church becoming to worldly and assimilated with mainstream secular culture like mainline Protestant denominations, Gilchrist's follow-up book offers the reader nothing new from what was stated in \\"Rome Or The Bush\\".    Rather, the theologians and authors Gilchrist was critical of in \\"Rome Or The Bush\\" are attacked with even more vehemence and in lengthier chapters, though this is done in a strange manner with highly nontraditional language that perhaps allowed me to get through \\"New Church Or True Church\\" when I first browsed it. Nonetheless, Gilchrist's viewpoints are so close to those of the hierarchy of the twenty-first century that one, today, is left seeing both this book and \\"Rome Or The Bush\\", as nothing new to any observer.    Indeed, the lack of new discovery in this book is really its clearest feature, for the hierarchy of the Catholic Church will be stating the same things for hundreds of years from today. All I could gain from this book when I rad it is a good knowledge of how ordinary Catholics think about controversial issues from the late twentieth century.    Thus, \\"New Church Or True Church\\" is not distinguished in any way, and its tone is too aggressive to make it worth recommending. To be honest, being more practicla about social benefits (of adhreing to traditional teachings) stands as far more helpful.	2003-03-04

Though Lavinia attempts to look at all sides of the issue, she actually comes across as having written a book seriously lacking in detail.<br /><br />The discussion of her early life is very poor, and Lavinia appears to just be thinking that what she has done ever since first joining the IBVM in the early 1960s was almost mapped out at the time. Lavinia never discusses how she came to think the way she did, and instead focuses only on the way in which certain groups like the Catholic Truth Society just focus on such issues os contraception in ways that were different from her childhood.<br /><br />We do see the way in which the Vatican successfully censored her book (apparently through conservative laity in Britain), but, again, though the writing style is clear, we are left empty of understanding except of Lavinia's desire to state her opinions in ways the Vatican would not allow a nun to do.<br /><br />Given that, unlike the papacy and its teachings, the idea of female ordination in the Catholic Church (the theme to a considerable degree of this work) is already destined to be a passing fad, this book also lacks relevance. One should say it was destined to be a passing fad because the idea of female ordination is so contrary to traditional views of human personaility. In the future, I feel, books on female ordination in the Catholic Church will be only found in archives of secular academia.<br /><br />John Paul's writings and his policy, on the other hand, are shaping and will shape the Catholic Church as long as it exists.<br /><br />Though an easy read, this book is not really a reward.	2003-03-02

The next part of the book is a most impressive study of Al-Qaeda's finances and points out that their vast financial reserves (donated by ordinary Muslims) are not very important to Bin Laden even though they do allow him to set up terrorist camps in Sudan and Afghanistan.<br /><br />The next part of the book is a comprehensive study of Osama Bin Laden's life. It begins with a study of his father, Muhammad Bin Laden, who was a wealthy businessman from a Yemeni background who moved to Saudi Arabia and offered service to the kings of the day. The book looks at his other family members, inluding Muhammad Bin Laden's many wives, and what has happened to the company Osama's father founded.<br /><br />The next part of the book shows how Osama developed into a Muslim leader and crusader against the \\"infidels\\". It traces him from his recruitment by the US and Saudi governments to fight against the Soveit invasion of Afghanistan, up to the time aroung 1989 when he turned on his former allies and lost his Saudi citizenship. This part of the book is very clear and not difficult to understand because of the clear focus on Bin Laden.<br /><br />The latter part of the book continues on with understanding Bin Laden's motifs and the way in which he has trained \\"martyrs\\" and other terrorists for the cause of Islam. Especially good is the way in which the author shows that, in contrast to the ephemeral character of issues in Western politics, for these committed Muslims holy war against the unbeliever is something that can and must be prepared for decades. This suggests many problems with present-day Western government as far as meeting the Muslim terrorist threat because sudden changes in policy, the author points out, can occur very easily in the West but are ruinous in dealing with this threat. Hence we in the West have a major dilemma about islamic terrorism.<br /><br />A wonderful addition to anyone's reading list about Islam and terrorism after September 11 2001.of Islam.

The story of Edith Stein - which I have researched quite a bit in the years since - is one example. There is little evidence she was actually martyred for her Catholic faith rather than becaus eshe was Jewish, yet she was canonised as a martyr in 1998.<br /><br />However, there is, for most of this book, much too much dense argument that really boils down to little more than re-hash of what liberal critics of the Vatican said through the Wojtyla papacy. the theological arguments about the ordination of women are actually something I prefer to avoid - an argument from biology would be far superior I feel - yet Wills takes that approach to poor effect, and the same thing is true on the issue of contraception.<br /><br />The second part of the book is similarly flawed: there are better acocunt of the way the Vatican mismanaged its financances during the 1960s and 1970s - and the problems it had trying to rein in its financial losses - where even cardinals made suggestions John Paul would not accept.<br /><br />This is really too stereotyped a book to be of use unless you are a scaptical Catholic looking for hope. At least it's far better than Will's dreadful follow-up which stands as one of the worst books I have read.	2003-02-28

Spencer and Pryce-Jones show very clearly that the Qur'an does not command peace, but instead tells Muslims to \\"slay the idolaters wherever you find them\\". He points out the Muslims will, under Islamic law, impose a tax on non-Muslims who live within Muslim countries which they can avoid only by converting to Islam.<br /><br />Especially good is his focus on the way in which the Qur'an is valued by Muslims as a literally true document of an infallible nature. Though he admits there are different interpretations of the document, he show that it is quite unlike the way in which Christians have viewed the Bible. In fact, there nearest parallel in Christianity or Judaism to how Muslims regard the Qur'an is found today in the doctrine of papal infallibility and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis - a definitively infallible document forever binding on Roman Catholics.<br /><br />The book shows that because of this, extremist groups have had an easy time gaining power in Islam, as the Wahhabis did in the eighteenth century to purify Islam. Because of the importance of the Koran and the fact that Wahhabis policies can be seen very frequently within it, they encountered little opposition. The same thing, Spencer and Pryce-Jones argue, is true of the Islamic scientists of the Middle Ages, who also disappeared when \\"fundamentalist\\" movements emerged within Islam. Similar things indeed happen in the Catholic Church where Opus Dei and Focolare are used to combat dissent from papal teaching, but not in Protestantism, where fundamentalism occurs only in tiny sects which rarely keep people's adherence for long. This strength of belief is simply unknown to most Westerners today, but it is very much a part of Islam and the Catholic Church hierarchy. It is why the hijackers were able to plan so patiently for the killer attack on America whilst Americans were not devoted to any serious cause that might counter the threat.<br /><br />Most chilling, though, is the way in which the book looks at the life of Muhammad and suggests that it was not by any means what we would call \\"saintly\\". He even suggests that Khomeini behaved similarly in his 1928 marriage, but the way he describes Muhammad as taking legitimately many wives and having repeated sexual intercourse with them after he became a prophet is quite surprising. It is hear that the Sunnah becomes so helpful because it reveals so much about Islam's beginnings and the life of Muhammad during that time. We see that not only was Muhammad sexually promicuous with young girls, he led armies into war during his prophethood, and his successors saw jihad against non-Muslims as a basic duty, leading to Islamic empires being established in the Middle Ages. These theocracies persist to this day.<br /><br />However, one sees here similarities between Islam and pre-Reformation Europe, where the Church was the centre of learning and its teachings were seen as absolutes defined by tradition. The Spanish Inquisition in particular had a similar view of unbelievers to that propagated by Islam according to Spencer, and even today the Catholic Church takes a similar view of dissent to that propagated by Islam. This has not stopped extreme secularisation in many once-Catholic nations but has allowed for a stronger retention of doctrine under highly unfavourable conditions for religious faith.<br /><br />Given that he overlooks some points, this is not perfect but still interesting and clear.ly for the killer attack on America whilst Americans were not devoted to any serious cause that might counter the threat.

US	38024326	R22QYBDBGG2ET2	0140035044	810240063	The First Sex	Books	3	6	13	N	N	Brilliantly written, but very likely quite wrong	Elizabeth Gould Davis' `The First Sex' was written in 1971 and attempted to argue that women are the natural leaders of society and that humanity is being destroyed by patriarchy. The book is written in a very logical manner starting with what Gould Davis describes as \\"matriarchal queendoms\\" and states that these were culturally advanced and ecologically highly sustainable.<br /><br />She bases her arguments on the science of archaeology and anthropology as they developed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She states that the patriarchal Christian and Jewish societies of the last five or six millennia have wanted to destroy remnants of this matriarchal culture because of their desire to suggest society had always been male-dominated, Moreover, Gould Davis constantly states that these religions and their gods and bloodthirsty and demanding sacrifices of animals in contrast to earlier goddesses who demanded only vegetables as sacrifices.<br /><br />The goddess religion, she argues, was a female montheism with priestesses wearing robes like those of male priests today. She argued that matriarchal societies possessed a much more genuine democracy than do modern patriarchal societies because human rights took precedence over property rights and there was no rigid moral conformity as there is in most patriarchal societies.<br /><br />Gould Davis spends the early part of her book on describing the \\"Golden Age\\" of mother-right, based on the idea of a pacifist humanity with a female deity. Before this, she states that all myth is built around the ideal of a \\"golden age\\", including that of the Fall in the Bible. Gould Davis sees the \\"fall\\" of mythology as relating to male gods taking over from the Great Goddess, man becoming carnivorous and mercy and justice being replaced with warlike vengeance. As stated above, she relies on archaeology to find evidence that there was no violence in these ancient matriarchal societies which she said were universal in the early days of humanity.<br /><br />She then moves onto the patriarchal revolution, saying that patriarchy probably first evolved in barbaric societies that relied on nomadic herding in arid climates, but which, with the spread of the Semites, moved into more settled agricultural societies with the coming of the Jews. (However, she says that India was the first civilised country to shift to father-right). She then in a systematic way traces the decline in the status of women from the advent of Christianity, which she saw as producing a huge decline in scholarship and scientific knowledge.<br /><br />Indeed she actually sees it as Christianity's job to submit women and repress their desire for power, and views the vast appeal of Catholicism today as spawning from the devotion to Mary rather than its patriarchal Trinity. As [[ASIN:0394711556 Marina Warner]] has said, this devotion to Mary is actually opposed to power for women because extreme feminisation (through a female deity) most likely according to contemporary psychology would make a culture have extremely rigid gender roles. Even men taking on the appearance of women is likely to be a preventitive device against masculinisation of women.<br /><br />Her idea that Charistianity was unusually barabric and violent does not agree wiht the research of many other scholars, for although there were wars in the Middle Ages they were not unusually severe. Even the idea that people were driven away from Christian Europe by despotic clergy is uncertain.<br /><br />However, despite the fact that Gould Davis has obviously done much research, her claims about continuing decline in the status of women since the nineteeth century. She does cite such philosophers as Rousseau very well, but she does not consider early feminists like Matilda Joslyn Gage or Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Moreover, recent discoveries in the field of archaeology have laid the gravest doubts concerning the existence of pacifist, matriachal societies in early humanity - Gould Davis may have not done a good job, for no reputable scholar today believes in the matriachates she describes. Even those suspicious of universal patriarchy do not accept matriarchies.<br /><br />Nonetheless, an enthralling read that can show just how far (and how deep) feminists are able to go if they have the brains and talent.ity - Gould Davis may have not done a good job, for no reputable scholar today believes in the matriachates she describes.

He shows how silence aims to produce recollection in those who encounter it and the existence of historical precendents for the Quakers before the seventeeth century. Punshon understands effectively how the first Friends saw convincement (being reborn as a Quaker).<br /><br />Punshon then focuses on unprogrammed Quaker worship and the manner in which it occurs through believers coming together in silence to pray. He is very effective in focusing on the enviroment created by the simplicity of worship so evident in Quakerism, and he does a useful job of understanding the way in which Quakerism has evolved into the present.<br /><br />The next part of the book looks at the Quaker testimony and the way in which Punshon was attracted to Quakerism and the meaning of this \\"Testimony\\" which is expressed, Punshon feels, through one's life rather than though the Testimony's words.<br /><br />The remainder of the book aims to deal with the way in which Quaker ethics can be expressed in everyday life. Punshon shows very well who a Quaker meeting can be used to avoid distractions from everyday life, but he spends a lot of the book explaining how one still has to \\"know how to feel\\". The book then turns to the meaning of ministry and the rhythm of the unprogrammed meeting.<br /><br />Punshon does an effective job at remembering what he has learnt throughout the book, especially with repect to the various pieces of Quaker ministry. He does a very good job about explaining how ministry comes to people, and how harmony comes to a religious community.<br /><br />The next piece focuses on the way in which Quaker principles are applied outside of worship, with examples relating to decision making and being faithful (\\"if you are faithful in little you will be faithful in much\\"), and how Friends do not seek to avoid conflict in their opinions. The last few chapters of the book are focused on how Quaker principles are applied in daily life.<br /><br />Whilst none of Punshon's these are original, they are still a very good read.The next piece focuses on the way in which Quaker principles are applied outside of worship, with examples relating to decision making and being faithful (\\"if you are faithful in little you will be faithful in much\\"), and how Friends do not seek to avoid conflict in their opinions.

Nyro was an extremely private person, and Michele Kort is very careful about describing her intentions in writing \\"Soul Picnic\\".<br /><br />Nonetheless (or perhaps because of Nyro's privacy), \\"Soul Picnic\\" is by no means a difficult read at almost any point. The book is structured in a very clear chronological way, from Laura's beginnings to her last recordings in 1995. We see very clearly that Nyro was the child of some strongly left-wing immigrants and that this gave her an impressive social vision on her recordings, and later the example of her maternal grandfather Isidore Mirsky in avoiding meat. We then learn how Nyro grew up singing to the sounds of doo-wop and Motown in the early 1960s, beginning to write songs at a very young age before being discovered in the middle 1960s.<br /><br />In the following years, Laura Nyro developed incredibly with her music through the use of extremely complex chord shapes that were actually her own devising. However, though we see how her songs were altered by such artists as Three Dog Night and the Fifth Dimension to make them palatable to mass audiences, Nyro herself was determined, once a seemingly \\"edited\\" single version of \\"Save The Country\\" failed to chart, never to compromise again. Here, we see, though, many descriptions that cannot fit my impression of her work - I find Michele may not have what I would call an accurate perspective on it. The book is not as good in describing Nyro's actual recorded output as it is in giving a good impression of her life.<br /><br />[Actually, her post-\\"Christmas And The Beads Of Sweat\\" recordings were much more conventional than her seminal early albums, but the later albums were so ideologically stringent that she could never attract more than a tiny cult audience for them].<br /><br />We see in detail the significance of her influence on generations of singer/songwriters beginning with the mystical \\"Sophia\\", Kate Bush and the enigmatic confessional Rickie Lee Jones, and there is a good discussion of how singer/songwriters eveolved while Nyro herself was out of the spotlight during her failed marriage. We also see a reasonable description of Nyro's romantic life, including several failed romances with men in the music business (including Jackson Browne) and an unsuccessful marriage to carpenter David Bianchini and a romance with \\"gypsy\\" Gregory Bennett before she returned to make \\"Smile\\" and \\"Nested\\" in the late 1970s.<br /><br />After this untimely comeback, we see that most of the rest of Laura Nyro's life was lived with her son (fathered by an Indian man whom she refused to marry) and painter Maria Desiderio. She recorded only occasionally during this time, but Kort very clearly shows how she was not a reclusive woman, frequently moving away from her quiet cottage in Danbury, Connecticut to more urban environs in Massachussetts and Ithaca (upstate New York). She even would stay for a month in places as far afloat as Florida, and we learn about her very sweet tooth and love of fancy food - even though she managed to become a vegan and quit smoking, she always has problems with her weight.<br /><br />We see that she became a working musician - though not recording much - before she was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer after Patti DiLauria had noticed she was not well in early 1995. In these days, she was not interested in much more than her \\"tribe\\", yet she got a few quite respectable reviews for \\"Walk The Dog And Light The Light\\" - after having moved away from Columbia due to its demand of a studio album back in 1988 when she toured for the first time in ten years. We also see how she created \\"Mother's Spiritual\\" while at home rearing Gil, her son, and how she devloped the material of her later albums.<br /><br />Michele Kort concludes with an impressive finale aboutthe originality and importance of Laura Nyro, and the way in which her music has retained its relevance six years after she died. Yet, she does admit that her enduring originality as \\"the mother of all earth mothers\\" (the inventor of intensely feminine popular music) is not fully appreciated.<br /><br />On the whole, very easy reading even if you are not familiar with Nyro, but could do with more accurate song descriptions.ay in which her music has retained its relevance six years after she died.

Though, unlike what Yallop would want to believe, we do not know what polcies he would have pursued had he lived. The general trend ever since this book was published - and even beforehand - was/is for anyone remotely interested in the Catholic Church to assume Luciani would have followed policies they want. Yes, John Paul II has put the church on a definite course for centuries to come with documents like Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, but nobody knows for sure that Luciani would have been at all different.<br /><br />David Yallop apparently did a lot of good reaseach for this book, and he gives a good outline of Luciani's life and family history, from his youth in Forno Di Canale to his seminary studies and thesis to his days as bishop of Vittorio Veneto and Patriach of Venice. He is extremely impressive in his outlining of the problems faced by a wealthy Church - especially in the way it contradicts Jesus' teachings in the Gospels - and its history from the days when Mussolini singed the Lateran Treaty. The Lateran treaty gave enormous amounts of money to the Vatican, which it invested through Bernadino Nogara in many large corporations. We see how Nogara bought shares in companies that manufactured goods inconsistent with Catholic teaching - his investments were free of doctrinal considerations.<br /><br />After Nogara's death in 1958, the Vatican began to have financial troubles due to the cost of Vatican II. Though Yallop revealed little about the following period, he is most effective in showing how clearly the Vatican, in an effort to evade taxes, forged links with such notorious con men as Roberto Calvi and Michele Sindona, who, after Paul Marcinkus became head of the \\"Vatican Bank\\", took control of Vatican finances.<br /><br />This was, as Yallop points out, a disaster because huge sums of money was lost by the Vatican due to a series of scandals aimed at taking money to offshore tax havens. Pope Paul VI might have had dreams of becoming \\"the first poor Pope in modern times\\", but such dreams were clearly fabled in the circumstances. There were many links between these criminals and the corrput P2 masonic lodge led by Licio Gelli, who is supposed to have decided to murder the Pope after he wished to reveal the list of Masons in important positions in the Vatican. The whole chain revealed brilliantly by Yallop confirms the Vaticans involvement in organised crime through the \\"Vatican Bank\\".<br /><br />Albino Luciani was shown excellently to be a honest and incorruptible man who believed that the Church could not be rich if it wished to conform with the teachings of Jesus. This is why Luciani wanted to clean up the Vatican Bank and remove Calvi, Sindona and Marcinkus from it. This seemed a simple and logical decision given that the Vatican was suffering from financial problems by that point.<br /><br />However, Yallop brutally points out that it was not difficult for those involved with P2 to enter the Vatican and poison the Pope without giving a visible residue - thus the conclusion that he had died of heart failure. Yallop, however, clearly and simply points out that with Luciani's lifestyle he was not likely to suffer from heart failure - he ate a healthy diet and he suffered from low blood pressure.<br /><br />Thus, it is not unreasonable to conclude that Luciani was in fact murdered, though there are so many sources apparently concerning this question that it is difficult to tell, and other sources make improbable claims Luciani would have \\"disowned\\" Humanae Vitae. More conservative writers appear to have shown that he firmly supported the doctrine and say he would have followed the same policies as Karol Wojtyla did.<br /><br />This book should be read by anybody wishing to understand the darker side of the history of the Catholic Church, and is interesting for anyone who wished to read about organised crime in general.avens.

There is also a study of Communione e Liberazione (CL) and Neocatechumenate (NC). It aims to discuss the support that John Paul II has given these groups because of their theological conservatism and the opposition others in the Church have to them because of their interference with ecclesiastical affairs.<br /><br />The book is very effective in explaining how \\"During the reign of John Paul II, Catholic Rome has been invaded by wave upon wave of groups and movements of all sizes and shades...\\" in order to illustrate the impacts of these groups on the Catholic Church. Their fanaticism and willingness to follow Catholic doctrine in key political and theological arenas made John Paul II see them as more than useful. This led him to confer special status on these movements and to see them as a definitive model for laity in the Church. Thus, the Pope selected of many members of these groups - vastly out of proportion to their numbers - for the 1987 Synod On The Laity.<br /><br />Urquhart is exceedingly effective in showing the characteristics of these movements that make them cults, especially in terms of the way in which their founders are adored and the way in which they are seen as being the whole of Catholicism by members.<br /><br />Urquhart also manages to go into dense detail about how these groups have been opposed by parish priests and bishops because of their desire to appeal straight to the Pope. This is because they want to use any form of authority only to justify their own causes - indeed bishops can be recruits for these groups. In the case of NC, they want total domination of parishes. This part is hard to read, but has some effect in explaining the depth of this divide.<br /><br />Urquhart is much clearer about explaining how these groups are able to use the media to develop their views through journals like CL's \\"30 Giorni\\" (30 Days). He later does aim to show how they move news easily amongst members, and how they have been able to expand a great deal (except for CL, which has focused heavily on Italy).<br /><br />Urquhart also explains fairly easily their hierarchical structures and how the lives of members \\"are controlled down to the last detail\\" (as he experienced). He also looks at the rather unclear way in which the movements justify the neo-ultramontanism which has been revived under John Paul II, and believes that these organisations will provide the popes of the future.<br /><br />The later part of the book is focused on the sects' political involvement, which is what endeared them to John Paul. The sects, naturally, tend to allow members to vote only for politicians who support their own doctrine, despite the fact that they do claim to allow political freedom to their members. Like Opus Dei, these sects are very wealthy and in the case of Neocatechumenate, actively encourage accumulation. Focolare, by contrast, does not allow private property, but this has lead it to become extremely wealthy due to vast donations of members, the bulk of which goes towards expansion.<br /><br />Urquhart is extremely clear that these Catholic sects are extremely dangerous and that even now there is no way they can be stopped due to the fact that changes in policy are very unlikely - indeed I would go so far as to say that intensification of John Paul II's policies is certain to continue through the next series of Popes. There is little doubt that these movements have a rosy future and it is not likely that many will be easily informed of the danger in them, especially given the Pope's power and his support - though Urquhart does admit he would like to see it.<br /><br />On the whole, an essential read to see where the Catholic Church is heading.<br /><br />It would be better if the book were broken down into a much larger number of chapters or if each sect (CL, Focolare, NC) was treated separately from the others so that one could study and compare them.

US	38024326	RR5FP9Z6YVZFT	0316063797	614752116	Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Rather narrow in focus and picture	\\"Our Band Could Be Your Life\\" was an attempt to document the American indie scene of the 1980s, which has been seen by critics and modern music lovers as an alternative to the soft rock and synth-pop that dominated commercial radio during the 1980s and is seen to have aged very badly now due to the heavy big-budget production.<br /><br />The book gives a detailed account of the lives of the bands contained within it. All of them played either stripped-down rock and roll or aggressive hardcore with the volume and speed turned right up. One band - Big Black - are seen as a precursor to industrial music's emergence into the mainstream with NIN. However, these bands did differ in some important ways, and some of the hardcore bands did attempt to incorporate other styles into their music - not easy to notice for my ears.<br /><br />However, because of their simplicity and spontaneity and the fact that they were seen as the carriers of rock's populist roots, these bands earned vast critical slaving. They dominated critics' \\"best of\\" lists throughout the 1980s and continue to be the only artists from that era featuring in \\"all time best albums lists\\" of writers like Joe S. Harrington. Nonetheless, bands such as the Minutemen, Minor Threat, Mission of Burma and Black Flag never dented the Top 200, and the now-famous H&uuml;sker D&uuml; did so only after signing with Warners.<br /><br />The descriptions of each band and its history are generally quite detailed, even dense in the way in which the bands' personnel grew up and how they decided to form a band in order to express their own visions. For instance, one sees the detail given of Ian MacKaye's father's history as a prgressive religious figure. The descriptions of events in the bands's histories are similarly detailed, especially with regard to the ideals of the members involved (probably in order to contrast with the mainstream in the 1980s) and the relationships between them - such as the struggle between Mould and Hart over the writing of \\"Warehouse - Songs and Stories\\".<br /><br />One also sees this dense study in the split between Macis and Barlow in Dinosaur Jr, or in the very unusual manner in which Sonic Youth bought (and later were given) cheap guitars so that they could experiment with new tunings. Yet, one notices no attempt to assess or explain actions of these bands - it is taken by the author as something inevitable with very little justification for why this should be so. The descriptions of the recordings and music of the bands discussed is generally good and worthwhile, if not very clear about what each band was aiming for. This part, though it is buried somewhat, will be found useful by music historians even though there are no descriptions of individual songs and their lyrics or music. There is also very little clarity in explaining who influenced these bands and how they developed their sounds.<br /><br />Moerver, the book is narrow in focus not only in the way in which it writes about the bands it covers, but also in terms of its apparent fear of history. The tendency for punk and related genres to dominate critics' polls, in fact, goes back at least to the New York Dolls in the middle 1970s, and became ingrained, NOT in 1981, but with the first punk bands in the late 1970s. In order to understand what had happened in the American underground during the 1980s, one would have to look at such bands as the Germs, the Angry Samoans, Pere Ubu, X or the Circle Jerks. This would show where the 1980s underground movement really originated from and who actually pioneered the modern \\"underground\\" sound. Unlike in Britain, in America there is no doubt that the \\"punk revolution\\" had little effect apart from making commercial radio still more conservative. Yet, there is no discussion of how early US punk bands worked in an environment of stiflingly restrictive commercial radio and exceedingly weak noncommercial radio.<br /><br />There is no discussion of what aspect of themusic of these bands was seen as important by critics. Without universal or near-universal critical praise, these bands would be unknown legends at best, utterly forgotten otherwise.<br /><br />There is certainly some focus on how the bands gained exposure from the emergence of college radio in the middle 1980s, but little study or assessment concerning how much of a success college radio actually was. There is no doubt that some 1980s bands like R.E.M. and the Violent Femmes sold large numbers of records because of college radio support. However, bands seen by critics like Joe S. Harrington as \\"uncompromising\\" gained no extra sales at all from college radio.<br /><br />On the whole, this book stands as too narrow in focus to be an essential read, but it is not bad.Without universal or near-universal critical praise, these bands would be unknown legends at best, utterly forgotten otherwise.

This really does benefit the book because the reader can know each artist mentioned much more than in [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]]. One gains a true understanding of each artist, the people who formed them, their ideals and the music they made in a way one does not with [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]].<br /><br />Moreover, Unterberger tries to explain the fact that there are so many undiscovered gems from the 1960s in terms of the culture of the decade. On the whole, he is fairly successful, even though he is careful to avoid claiming that the bands discussed were better than such acts as the Beatles, Rolling Stones or Velvet Underground. He is very successful, though, in explaining what has attracted certain groups of people to the undiscovered music of the 1960s, and tries to avoid the very common critical viewpoint that only those sixties bands who were predecessors of punk and new wave (Velvets, Stooges, MC5, Beefheart and the garage bands) are important today.<br /><br />Some of the artists did actually have a major hit or fair success on album charts, unlike [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]], where there are very severe qualifications for inclusion. Such artists are re-evaluated in terms of other work that did not succeed of the charts. Distribution was not as regular in the sixties as it is today so that many bands could have had a hit locally that never became a hit nationally. This was particularly true of some \\"blue and brown eyed soul\\" groups such as Thee Midniters and The Rationals, the latter of which could never break out of their hometown in the era before the \\"Detroit sound\\" of the Stooges, MC5 and Alice Cooper became established.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, the artists mentioned receive a good description and one is able to track what the members of each groups discussed were doing (or collaborators in the case of artists like Tim Buckley) and to the way in which they evolved throughout their careers. This is, I feel, a better way of doing thins than the brief profiles of [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]], and gets into one's mind more easily. At the same time, it is no more revealing for some who reads incessantly about music than [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]], and the artists do not require as much to be written about them as the artists in [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]] (Unterberger admits this).<br /><br />On the whole, this is worthy reading and rather better presented than [[ASIN:0879305347 The Unknown Legends Of Rock'n'Roll]].s, the latter of which could never break out of their hometown in the era before the \\"Detroit sound\\" of the Stooges, MC5 and Alice Cooper became established.

However, the early part of the book is devoted to British Invasion bands such as The Creation and the garage bands who are now seen as pioneers of the \\"punk revolution\\" before the Velvets, Stooges and MC5 (all household names today and not included) emerged. The next part is focused on obscure psychedelic innovators of the late sixties such as the Great Society (which featured household-name singer Grace Slick), the Blossom Toes and The Deviants.<br /><br />Following that is a number of fairly superfluous inclusions in Nick Drake and Love, both of whom are extremely familiar in most record guides, and Roky Erickson and Syd Barrett, who are similarly well-known in musical circles and among critics. The next part of the book deals with punk groups who didn't receive the critical slaving so typical of most commercially unsucessful punk groups of the 1970s and 1980s, though at least one (the Raincoats) is quite familiar today owing to Kurt Cobain's championing of them. There are also (fairly superfluous in parts) entries on Krautrock giant Can and on the rock bands of Stalinist Eastern Europe and the persecution they suffered.<br /><br />The next part deals with the lo-fi bands of the 1980s and 1990s, with a major focus on New Zealand's Flying Nun label, well-known to certain sections of the US rock crit establishment. The second last part deals with artists who could only make one album, the troubles that making it caused and the significance of that sole release; and the final chapter deals with the exact opposite: long-lived artists such as the Red Krayola who have never attempted to confirm to commercial trends.<br /><br />All in all, most of it is well done, and the introduction is most interesting with its illustration of how unique and strange \\"Forever Changes\\" sounded to someone raised on the ultra-conservative commercial radio of the late 1970s.<br /><br />However, the book does lack the feeling of sheer wonderment and sense of having discovered something new: we are seeing things that are often found in the writings of eccentric critics such as Joe S. Harrington, whose Top 100 Albums on the webzine Blastitude should be read by all interested in music. Also, there is (as often with rock criticism) a shortage of female artists such as Essra Mohawk, Annette Peacock and Judee Sill, who could have formed another chapter by themselves but are probably disliked by Richie because eccentric women tend to be too much acquired tastes.<br /><br />The focus in the late 1970s and beyond does tend to be too narrow - in part for the reasons mentioned above.<br /><br />All in all, eminently worth reading, but scarcely some wonderful revelation.inal chapter deals with the exact opposite: long-lived artists such as the Red Krayola who have never attempted to confirm to commercial trends.

It contrasts progressive rock with earlier styles in terms of orientation (to body or mind), social status (working or middle class), lyrics (fastasy or romance & fun); and the song structures (extended suites such as \\"Echoes\\" or \\"Supper's Ready\\" in place of simple verse-bridge-chorus songwriting).<br /><br />The amin focus, sensibly, is on the \\"true\\" progressive rock bands, where the emphasis was on flashy solos rather than, as in the case of numerous other artists of the era, improvisation. However, the book, I feel, ought to define progressive rock much more clearly than it does - and explain these definitions too. Often, especially in a prog-phobic country like Australia, there was never a great deal of care in this process. Moreover, those artists lumped in with progressive rockers (whether by punks or musicologists is irrelevant) were often as radically different from each other as they are from \\"true\\" progressive rock bands.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with song structures of various pieces by such bands as Yes, explaining key musical points in their songs to show how progressive rock evolved. The later part of the book focuses on the piece \\"2112\\" by Rush (based on a work by Ayn Rand) and on \\"math rock\\", a little-known genre of rock in which unorthodox time signatures and shifting rhythms are used constantly rather than as occassional changes in rhythm. This is very interesting for someone interested in music theory, but it is not done by any means thoroughly so that everything is clear to the less knowledgeable. Rather, only a few tiny fragements are given attention.<br /><br />Moreover, in the latter part of the book, unauthenticated calims are made that certain critically acclaimed bands in the 1990s (like Sonic Youth, generally classed as experimental rock - a genre which in some ways is an odd point between progressive rock and punk) have been influenced by progressive rock - and if we do, it does not seem to me to be very well done even though I am not knowledgeable about the bands concerned.<br /><br />However, this is a most interesting read nonetheless.by such bands as Yes, explaining key musical points in their songs to show how progressive rock evolved.

It is very useful reference in that it contains a great deal of information about major rock bands - including long out of print albums and all the tracks on them, chart placings in the UK and US, and infornation on singles released.    Basically, each artist's releases are listed in chronological order with tracks and UK and US peak chart placings (if any - note that a line in the box indicates that the album never got a domestic release in the relevant country). Each artist discussed is summarised through each album and the way in which it fared both critically and commercially. In the list of albums, band line-up changes are mentioned as they occur, though full line-ups are not given for each album to make the book still easier to understand.    The albums are rated on a scale from (*0) - only one case in the whole book - to (*10) for the best albums, but, like so much rock criticism, the ratings are inconsistent and never explained with any clarity whatsoever. This is especially true of later releases by established artists, almost all of which are panned whether there is a good reason or not for doing so.    The guide is very good in that it is very easy to read because of its layout, but, with the exception of a small number of extremely popular artists it neglects the less \\"rock\\" styles of popular music such as r and b almost entirely - and because it is British, artists receiving no interest outside the US are left undiscussed. This makes it a bit problematic for a serious study of pop music.    On the whole, a very useful reference work for the student if little more than that.	2002-11-12

In later years it is true that the focus shifts to records popular in the UK and Europe rather than those well-known in the United States, but that is because MOJO is a British magazine.<br /><br />The albums chosen are most interesting indeed - I cannot fail to note the obscure folk classics of the 1970s that are mentioned and in at least two cases, be bewildered by the descriptions of the artists involved. There are, at least up until the 1990s, a number of albums chosen simply for their extreme popularity - most notably the nominations by Journey and Don McLean. Also, we note greatest hits compilations by proven hitmakers such as the 5th Dimension included at the end of the book to add some interest and address the tastes of Top 40 audiences. (This is worthwhile in intent, but could be confusing for some).<br /><br />Most of the albums chosen, though, are chosen largely for their artistic significance, though, as stated above, that focus becomes narrower among the selections of the 1990s, which makes the later part of the book probably the least interesting (though it still surprises me nonetheless).<br /><br />The 1970s part of the book is full of varied selections, from the obvious ([[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side of the Moon]]) to the obscure ([[ASIN:B000000E7K Airs and Graces]]) that make a reader who could never get a chance to hear these albums all the more curious about them. The inclusion of personnel who made the albums adds to what is a minefield of knowledge that, in many cases, could not be acquired elsewhere. The writings also can give significant insights into the personalities and even the lives of the artists involved in a way most record guides never could do. The 1980s part, though less wide in focus, is almost as intersting to read.<br /><br />Of course, there will be criticisms of the selections in the book - the most obvious in my unworthy opinion being the includion of [[ASIN:B0000256KE For Your Pleasure]] rather than [[ASIN:B0000256K7 Country Life]] or [[ASIN:B0000256VK Avalon]] to represent Roxy Music.

However, the first one has been long out of print so for those (like me) who are curious about a theoretical study of her songs, this songbook is a useful purchase. However, on receiving it from amazon.com surprisingly early, I was initially impressed, but ultimately there are many faults to be found.<br /><br />Glancing through \\"Time and Love: The Art and Soul of Laura Nyro\\" does clearly give some clues to the extraordinary complexity of chords and tempo changes that made [[ASIN:B000068QZP New York Tendaberry]] and the more difficult [[ASIN:B0000024WG Christmas And The Beads Of Sweat]] extraordinary, ahead-of-their-time masterpieces. Laura Nyro, in contrast to the expectations of rock critics of this and subsequent eras, would never resort to loud three-chord rock. Yet, the notation used in the book is unclear - no exact tempos and very little understanding of the structures that her songs, on close examination, do actually have.<br /><br />Even on her most \\"rock\\" material, such as \\"Beads Of Sweat\\", guitar players (there Duane Allman) were never allowed to indulge in heavy solos. Instead, they moved remarkably fluently with the groove of the song and its rises and falls. Most of her material was complex, many-chord and piano-based, with the added difficulty of a complex, multipersonal narrative style that can easily baffle critics. However, it was this combination of soft textures, spiritually themed lyrics and multipersonal narratives that paved the way for such works as [[ASIN:B00004R7TP Hounds Of Love]], [[ASIN:B000002IT2 Little Earthquakes]], [[ASIN:B000007R1O Victorialand]] and [[ASIN:B000002GIT Days Of Open Hand]].<br /><br />Yet, there is a flawed focus here (as on \\"Stoned Soul Picnic - The Best Of Laura Nyro\\" and \\"Time And Love - The Essential Masters\\") on songs that other artists had hits with. Notwithstanding that without the publicity thus generated, Laura Nyro's own recordings, being so innovative and idiosyncratic, would almost certainly have sold so poorly that Columbia would probably have dropped her before her first comeback in the late 1970s ([[ASIN:B000068QZP Tendaberry]] and [[ASIN:B000068QZR Miracle]] actually sold enough copies to be profitable), this alone could never make Nyro significant six years after her death.<br /><br />Today newcomers really need to understand Nyro's role as an influence on such artists as Kate Bush, Jane Siberry, Tori Amos and Suzanne Vega, not the fact that she wrote hits for the Fifth Dimension and Barbara Streisand (how strange would that appear for someone who inspired \\"Running Up That Hill\\")??? For a reasonably-priced songbook, this would necessarily mean deleting some of the songs the Fifth Dimension and Streisand covered.<br /><br />Except for two tracks from her last Columbia album (\\"Walk The Dog And Light The Light\\"), nothing not found on [[ASIN:B000002878 Stoned Soul Picnic]] or [[ASIN:B00004Z3U2 Time And Love - The Essential Masters]] is here, not even \\"Captain For Dark Mornings\\", \\"Tom Cat Goodbye\\", \\"Brown Earth\\" or \\"Map To The Treasure\\". Also missing is a taste of Nyro's jazzy late 70s period, which produced the brilliant but accessible \\"Money\\" and \\"I Am The Blues\\".<br /><br />There is also little discussion of the character and structure of Nyro's songs that would allow a reader to appreciate why they have became so significant - instead there are copies of handwritten pages from her journal that do little but scratch the surface of what Laura Nyro was doing in writing and recording, and how she did it.<br /><br />On the whole, just a useful reference - not comprehensive.innovative and idiosyncratic, would almost certainly have sold so poorly that Columbia would probably have dropped her before her first comeback in the late 1970s ([[ASIN:B000068QZP Tendaberry]] and [[ASIN:B000068QZR Miracle]] actually sold enough copies to be profitable), this alone could never make Nyro significant six years after her death.

This book is a useful guide to alternative guitar tunings that can easily be read by someone (like me) who is not a musician but is merely curious about music theory.<br /><br />The book is very well set out, with the various alternate tunings (standard guitar tuning and standard tunings for other stringed instruments such as the cello and mandolin are also listed) being listed alphabetically from A to G# to make it easy to read. The tunings usually have examples given of a piece which uses them, though for some types of tuning this is not given. To give a clear description of what pitch strings are tuned to, an easy-to-read and understand system of upper and lower case and prime (A', A, a, a') notation is used so that there is never confusion even for an inexperienced reader.<br /><br />Though not detailed, this is worth reading if you're just curious.	2002-09-18
