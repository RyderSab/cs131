I mean, by p. 10 he talking about Diophantine equations and Goldbach-like conjectures, and soon after, \\"PA\\" and \\"ZFC\\" are tossed about as if they were practically everyday acronyms for most people. The book is however, largely free of formulas and proofs, for those who are dissuaded by such. The overviews of the theorems themselves is not as lucid as I imagine they could be (which is why I rate it a 4 instead of a 5). The overviews will also seem a bit alien to someone expecting and Nagel & Newman kind of treatment; instead, this is discussed from a more abstract perspective of the characteristics and properties of formal systems, which avoids getting into the gritty details (even  Gdel-numbering is not explained in detail!) but may be hard to grasp for someone not used to thinking at this level of abstraction about mathematical systems.  <br /> <br />With that said, I still think it is quite worthwhile reading, and at a slim 170ish pages, it is a fairly quick read. After the overviews, he takes on various applications/misapplications of the theorems by topic. So, there are discussion of the theorems' relevance or applicability to things such as TOE (Theory of Everything), Turing machines, skepticism, minds, inexhaustibility, computability and so on. He does so typically by first giving several quotes that appear either in the literature or commonly on the internet, and then proceeds to either correct or clarify those quotes. Such notables as Roger Penrose, Freeman Dyson, and Stephen Hawking areamong the quoted who are scrutinized.  <br /> <br />I think the primary goal of the book is accomplished in its debunking of outright misuses of the theorems, and by way of correction and clarification of other uses, it accomplishes its pedagogical goal. I know it will cause me to strive to be more precise in any future invocations of these theorems. <br />	2005-08-07

Whereas Rosen has a tight, highly rigorous focus on his goal in \\"Life Itself\\", Kampis paints on a somewhat broader canvas, referencing the work of many other researchers (including Rosen). However, Kampis is similarly detailed and methodical. <br />Kampis first describes the limits of dynamical models, and state-based approaches, including the limitations inherent in the 'canonical formalism' of mechanics. <br />He then goes on to introduce 'component-systems'. This is a general formal representation of a system as being composed of some number of components out of an essentially unlimited number of possible components. In component systems, the \\"rules\\" for the dynamics of the system are not independent of the components themselves. Self-modifying component systems generate new components and delete others, thereby changing the identity of the system itself. In mathematical terms, a self-modifying system is like a function f that belongs to its own domain and range (\\"f:f-->f\\"). The result is that such systems are non-algorithmic, nor are their dynamics describable in a state-based formalism (e.g., Newtonian, Hamiltonian, etc.). This has notable consequences for approaches that attempt to treat such systems as algorithmic, or via modelling their state-based dynamics. By comparison to component systems, cellular automata and similar algorithmic formal systems are entirely trivial.<br />Kampis devotes many chapters to what I have cursorily mentioned, and there is much, much more in this book that is worth reading. Although there is not alot of math, what is there is important to understand. It would be helpful for the interested reader to generally understand the basic notation of mechanics, first-order differential equations, basic logic, Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, Turing machines, basic set theory, system theory, a modicum of philosophy, and linguistics. Most of these aspects are fairly well-explained, so a diligent reader can pick them up as he goes along.<br />This is not a book of vague handwaving arguments. It will take some studious effort to read and grasp the concepts and profundity of what he presents. However, it will be well worth the effort, and afterward you will never be able to look at dynamical systems and models, complexity, and self-modifying systems, in the same way. <br />Although there are alot of similarities between Kampis' and Rosen's works, they are sufficiently distinct in approaches and conclusions that both are well worth reading. <br />One final note: the \\"typewriter\\" font used throughout may be a bit surprising to see in the 21st century, but I found it entirely legible and comfortable once I got used to it.	2003-10-11

(This book has an Appendix where Schoch replies cogently to various critics of his Sphinx theory and cites some additional support.)<br />The main premise in this book is that there are enough distinct threads of evidence to support the theory that the proto-civilization for many of the notable cultures of the past (such as the ancient Egyptions, Mayans, and so on) was based in a time when the sea-levels were much lower in a region called \\"Sundaland\\". This region is now mainly underwater due to glacial melting since the last Ice Age and stretches from Indochina to Borneo and Timor. <br />Schoch uses a myriad of types of circumstantial evidence such as commonality of flood myths, linguistic comparisons, genetics, geologic, tree-ring data, archeological remains, ancient math and astronomical knowledge, and so forth to piece together support for his theory. Some of it is robust, some of it is a bit tenuous, but all in all, I find it worth considering.<br />In pulling together these disparate trails of evidence into a prehistorical timeline, I do not think Schoch has reached beyond plausibility; indeed, I consider some of mainstream archeology to be more ardently ideological and consist of far more speculative story-telling than what Schoch proposes here. <br />This book is a worthwhile read for someone interested in the idea that civilization did not spring up suddenly in the last 5-6,000 years. To me, it is far more parsimonious that the homo sapien mind of 10,000, 20,000, or even 40,000 or more years ago - a mind which was identical in capability to ours - had societies and cultures which acted as significant sources of knowledge and influence on the later cultures we know historically. Whether Sundaland was indeed the site of one of these proto-civilizations is something that will likely never be provable to a high degree of certainty, but perhaps this book will at least stir more investigation.	2003-02-11

All the appropriate buzzwords: 'complexity', 'emergence', 'chaos', 'neural nets', 'fractals', and so on are amply represented. As a compilation or overview of the research efforts into these various areas, this book succeeds reasonably well. For this, it gets three stars.<br />They explain to us in the Preface, \\"The consistent theme that runs throughout...is the understanding of biological processes in terms of complex dynamics from which emerge characteristic patterns of order. The objective is to show how scientists are thinking in this area and what tools are available for understanding the creative process.\\"<br />But, there is no concluding chapter, no summarization, no binding coherence beyond some vague sense of it all being somehow complex stuff, from ant colonies to brains to stock markets. All the different chapters convey their different messages and that is that. It all sounds important, highly scientific, cutting-edge, and intriguing. Gee, isn't it all amazing?<br />When it is all said and done, however, there is very little about biological systems that is actually explained by all these sexy topics.<br />An unintentional byproduct of this overview - what is most glaringly apparent when the dust settles and the mind clears - is the feebleness of all these efforts in making much of a dent in understanding life to any serious degree. And I think if there is one lesson to be taken away from this book, it ought to be that. For that feebleness makes a deep statement about the cogency of the application of the types of modalities presented to the problem of life, and about the notion of 'emergence' in general as being a computational problem.	2002-12-01

It is indeed a page-turner: the crisp writing is full of factual references but never burdened by them, like the photos, period paintings and documents illustrating the book, they enhance and support the narrative. It is free of ornamental flourishes or fawning, relying only on exposition of facts and quality writing.<br />Rarely do I agree with the marketing hype that usually makes up the front flap of a books dustjacket, but in this case, I agree wholeheartedly:<br />\\"This remarkable story of a great romantic hero separates the facts from legend and yet still manages to capture brilliantly all the excitement of the tale, of gallantry and heroism, of conspiracy and intrigue, of massacres and tragedy, set against the magnificent scenery of seventeenth-century Scotland.\\"<br />At least as thrilling as the story of William Wallace (alongside whom one of Graham's ancestors had fought two centuries earlier), this book is a very exhilarating tale of a remarkable person.	2002-12-01

However, once I began reading it, I quickly came to seriously consider Gold's thesis as tenable. By the end of the book, I was strongly inclined to think that Gold has a much more credible explanation for the source and formation of oil and gas than the de facto one.<br />Gold does write convincingly, but moreso he presents some very cogent reasons for his abiogenic theory. I'll not attempt to rehash the details, but just say that his theory is parsimonious, involves little hand-waving and uses no dramatics. <br />There is nothing scientifically outlandish here, unless you have some ideological adherence to the biogenic view. In fact, the biogenic view seems now quite contrived and dubious in retrospect. Gold's view accounts not only for oil, coal and gas, but also confers reasons for formations of biogenic matter - peat and lignite - as well. <br />Gold's further assertion that a biosphere exists going many kilometers down may have seemed ludicrous years ago, but in light of our knowledge of extremophiles nowadays, his thesis seems very plausible. <br />As if that weren't going far enough, Gold further asserts that it is far more likely that (assuming life had a terrestrial origin) such life began deep in the earth, not in shallow tidepools or other surface environments. Any origin-of-life theory is very difficult to justify, but Gold's seems as plausible as any, and more plausible than most.<br />A worthwhile read.	2002-11-29

Gods, who were once men, have no interest in achievement. One of natural wisdom takes no interest in fame.'&quot;<br />It is likely that the former is a closer transliteration, but in English it is inaccurate to say &quot;the Sage has no fame&quot;, when indeed he may have much fame about him. Then, what is meant? What is meant is what Ni makes plain. <br />Someone reading only Watson (or many similar translations) may struggle on interpreting that simple line for some time. But to what end? The sentences are not word puzzles.<br />I find nothing disingenuous about either approach. However, for myself, I find the cryptic nature of the highly transliterative approach as desirable mainly to the intellect and ego, and thus a distraction from the true intent. <br />I find that Ni is a capable translator of the intent - of conveying the wisdom - in this book, as he is in his translation of the Tao Te Ching.	2002-11-28

Keller's view of 'explanation' is that it is relative to the needs of each particular culture and their historical time (p. 5). As such, she does not really critique or analyze the various historical concepts to any degree. Essentially, she presents what happened, and who did it, and how some things fell in or out of favor at a given time.<br />The result is that this book is essentially a narrative of  approximately the last century of the history of biology. In that regard, it does succeed somewhat at attempting to condense the efforts of 100+ years of biology into about 300 pages. That is why I gave it two stars.<br />However, as Keller is a MIT philosopher of science and also trained in theoretical physics, I had expected more analytic depth, and some kind of &quot;edge&quot; - some thesis or thread or some other kind of thematic reason for her to be telling us all this history. Even on the most fundamental question of biology, &quot;what is life?&quot;, Keller equivocates, calling it &quot;a historical question, answerable only in terms of the categories that we as human actors choose to honor, and not in logical, scientific or technical terms.&quot; (p.294) Indeed, she does not even mention Schrodinger's 1943 lecture, &quot;What is Life?&quot;<br />The chapters on AI/AL are quite weak, focusing heavily on cellular automata (she mentions Wolfram several times). These tinker-toy computer games are about as close to life as a simulation of an earthquake is to an actual earthquake, in my opinion. Keller, however, describes computer simulations as being part of the 'revitalized' mathematical biology program.<br />She recounts the 'original' mathematical biology program as the one primarily led by Rashevsky, but also mentions Waddington and Turing. I find it odd that she did not mention Robert Rosen at all, considering he continued on after Rashevsky. I admit I am an admirer of Rosen's works, but her failure to even mention him seems odd considering she devotes an overly large number of pages to Turing's addition to mathematical biology.<br />Further, had she read Rosen's _Essays on Life Itself_, she would see that mimetic attempts at creating life with computer simulations is utterly ill-conceived. But, then again, since Keller engages in no analysis anyway, I should not be surprised at this.<br />Finally, Keller claims she shares some similarity to the philosopher of science Nancy Cartwright in believing that there is no set of universal laws of physics (and hence, in Keller's view, no universal set of laws of biology). Cartwright (who's books I admire) makes a good case for there being ontological reasons for this view (see Cartwright's _The Dappled World_). By contrast, Keller sees it as an epistemological problem, because the world is &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; and because of the &quot;disunity of human interests&quot;. (p. 301) I think Keller misconstrues Cartwright completely when Keller contrasts her position with one alleging &quot;an underlying incoherence&quot; to the world. Cartwright never supposed, or proposed, 'incoherence' of nature in her writing; rather, Cartwright attempts to make sense of the ontological basis for the patchwork manner of physical laws.<br />The title _Making Sense of Life_ is misleading, for this book does no such thing, nor even attempts to cobble together an approach to doing so. It may be worthwhile as a history of efforts in biology, but even in that regard I'd prefer a polemic narrator, rather than this one.	2002-11-24
US	51678985	R1BZL1JLI9AVE2	0940322064	166402917	The Mystery of Consciousness	Books	5	69	72	N	Y	A very good intro to the "Mind-Brain Problem"	Searle is certainly not timid in this collection of essays, based on reviews he wrote in the New York Review of Books. However, Searle is not really combative either - he is rather very straightforward in his argumentation. That, combined with the back-and-forth responses between Searle and some of the reviewed authors is very instructive to introducing one to some of the various philosophical stances toward consciousness and the mind-brain problem.<br />Searle's own stance is one of 'biological naturalism'. This view is best explicated in Searle's _The Rediscovery of the Mind_. It, roughly speaking, is a view that: 1) consciousness is a real, intrinsically first-person phenomena; 2) consciousness is brain-based - that is, it is physically based; and, 3) by virtue of #1 mind is not a reducible phenomena (since any third-person reduction destroys the essential 1st-person characteristic that makes consciousness what it is). Scientific study of the mind is not thereby discounted - such study need only take these points into account.<br />Regarding Edelman and Crick, Searle points out that despite that whatever neurological evidence and elaborations they may have come up with (in terms of neurological theories), neither presents a theory of consciousness per se. Whatever the 40Hz theory says, it can only claim a correlative relation, not a causitive relation, to consciousness at this point in its development.<BR>[For my money, _I of the Vortex_ by Rodolfo Llinas is more interesting than Edelman or Crick, and Llinas is somewhat less hyperbolic about his claims.]<br />Penrose is just tragically out to lunch, poor guy. And, if anything, Searle is overly generous in his treatment of Penrose's Godelian / computational arguments. The role of algorithmic simulation and the Incompleteness Theorems of Godel are grossly misused by Penrose, and Searle lets most of it slide, although he acknowledges that many criticisms along \\"technical\\" lines have been posed against Penrose. <BR>[A far more cogent understanding of the mind-brain problem in relation to Godel, simulation, and Church-Turing thesis, is in Robert Rosen's daunting _Essays on Life Itself_].<br />It is true that one could conceivably agree with Dennett that there is no consciousness and our sense of self-awareness is just illusion. But I think that such a view is neither common-sensically nor neurologically supported, or even suggested, for that matter. And Searle rightly flushes Dennett out from under the latter's evasive handwaving. I agree with Searle that Dennett's view is \\"pathological\\". There is a \\"lively\\" back-and-forth between the two. :)<br />Chalmers' supervenience view is next. And I think Searle rightly highlights the errors of this view. The reviewer who says that Searle is the one begging the question by disallowing Chalmer's zombie thought experiment (imagine a world with a physically identical zombie to a person in this world but with no consciousness) is mistaken, in my opinion. Since consciousness is not, a priori, fractionable from a person without causing some physical change in so doing, the onus is on Chalmers to show that such a fractionation is even theoretically possible in =this= world, =before= he poses a thought experiment where such a possible other world is presupposed. Otherwise, his thought experiment is just wishful thinking about some other fantasy world. To allow Chalmers to make such a claim without evidence is to let Chalmers presume his own conclusion.<br />Finally. the reviewer who commented that Searle implies that biological naturalism says consciousness is only a property of \\"biological matter\\", and another reviewer who similarly comments on the \\"privileged\\" status of only biological organisms as possibly conscious, both slightly miss Searle's point. Searle says that biological systems are =causally sufficient= to have the property of consciousness: only brains produce consciousness because those are precisely the only systems we know of that have consciousness. He in fact says, \\"Perhaps it is a feature we could duplicate in silicon or vacuum tubes. At present, we just do not know.\\" (p.203) So, \\"biological matter\\" is not somehow privileged per se, or vitalistic in any sense. <br />Part of the problem is that Searle's own view is presented only in a very compact, piecemeal form in this book. The interested reader will find that reading _The Rediscovery of the Mind_ will make Searle's own theory much clearer, and as a result will also make clearer Searle's objections to the other theories presented in this book of reviews.	2002-11-21

And yet there are approximately 10^14 microbes crawling all over your skin, inside your respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and other, um, 'nether regions'. This is a vibrant and very complex ecosystem we carry around on, and in, us. In the gastrointestinal tract alone there may be over 400 different types of microbes! <br />Tannock, professor of microbiology, author also of _Medical Importance of the Normal Microflora_ and _Probiotics: A Critical Review_, gives us here an overview of the remarkable preponderance of the indigenous microbiota. The book straddles the line somewhat between a general readership book and a book for students of microbiology, although it definitely leans toward the latter. For the astute layperson, it contains many fascinating bits of information. Indeed, I would like to see Tannock come out with a longer version aimed squarely at the general science readership.<br />Chapters are as follows:<BR>1. More than a smell: the complexity of the normal microflora<BR>2. Happy Birthday: the acquisition of the normal microflora<BR>3. Sticky Microbes: the association of microbes with host surfaces<BR>4. Invisible forces: the influence of the normal microflora on host characteristics<BR>5. Undesirable company: the role of the normal microflora in disease<BR>6. Internal renewal: the potential for modification of the normal microflora<br />At just over 100 pages, it is a quick read, despite some technical text. References at the end of each chapter are to professional journals and textbooks. Perhaps it is because of the book not catering exactly to a particular category of reader that has made it scarce, but whatever the reason, I had a hard time ordering this book through Amazon and ended up getting it via Kluwer Academic Publishers in Norwell, Mass. <br />As in his other books, Tannock conveys the interdependencies of our symbiosis with the microflora, and as he says in this Preface: <BR>\\"Our relationship with the normal microflora provide excellent examples of ecological balances that have evolved between species, and the repercussions that ensue should the balance be tilted in favour of one or another partner. An appreciation of this concept is important for all those who study biological sciences.\\"	2002-11-19

The text is essentially a narrative for the algebra and differential equations that comprise the primary explanatory mechanism of the book. There is far less reliance on topology in this book than Thom's, and it tends to appear mainly in the things like the visualization of the obligatory seven elementary catastrophe types.<br />The applications given are intended to be fairly simple to understand (in keeping with the lack of specialization of the intended audience), so they are fine for an intro book, but I would tend to call them only &quot;examples&quot; rather than &quot;applications&quot;.<br />I contrast this book with Thom's by saying that this intro book will give you the mechanics of catastrophe theory and some examples, whereas Thom's book paints a much broader conceptual picture with many profound speculations on the applications of catastrophe theory. Both books have their respective value and I feel they are good complements to each other to the newcomer to catastrophe theory.	2002-11-16

This frees him up to spend most of his ink on explicating and clarifying the views of Aristotle. Where contrasts do appear, they are intended to &quot;...bring to light how different Aristotle's world is from the modern, not to show how Aristotle's beliefs fall short of what we now take to be the truth.&quot;<br />The organization is by concepts, so within one section there are often references to various books on Aristotle. This is much more helpful than simply attempting to narrate, or move in lockstep, with Aristotle's sequence of writings.<br />The references are generally sufficient, footnoted at the bottom of the pages. Occasionally, the original Greek words or phrases are also footnoted. (I would have preferred more of the latter, but that is a quibble.)<br />The author is neither pretentious nor superficial. His writing is that of a patient tutor who is willing to explain, but also not willing to oversimplify. In so doing, the book comes across as being ardently respectful of Aristotle, and it is an excellent companion to reading Aristotle's works.	2002-11-16

His work - first as a student of physicist and theoretical biologist Nicholas Rashevsky, and later as professor emeritus at Dalhousie - is unquestionably of the level of importance of Einstein's Special/General Theory of Relativity, or Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. This is a grand claim to make, but once you read Rosen's work, you will see for yourself.<br />These are not the easiest books to read, despite Rosen's excellent writing skills. The difficulty is two-fold. First and foremost, the new concepts and paradigms presented are of such breadth and profundity that it can take several readings to begin to fully grasp them adequately. Secondly, Rosen is mathematically (and otherwise) quite astute. The reader will encounter to some degree: category theory, topology, catastrophe theory (Rosen dedicates a chapter on genericity in _Essays_ to Rene Thom), differential equations, dynamical systems, Godel, Church-Turing, as well as philosophical topics of epistemology, ontology, and foundations of biology, mathematics and physics.<br />This should not, however, deter even the non-professional. Particularly in _Life Itself_, Rosen progresses carefully and patiently, even including a short intro to Category Theory. One can gloss over some of the math and still garner most of the insights from the text alone. _Essays_ utilizes a wider range of math skills, since that book covers a broader range of topics, but it is still quite accessible to the careful and astute reader.<br />In _Life Itself_, Rosen was investigating the question posed by Erwin Shrodinger originally in his 1943 lecture &quot;What is Life?&quot;. Rosen's search led him to peel back in careful detail the foundations of Newtonian mechanicsand reveal the underlying tacit assumptions of a state/phase-based physics and the repercussions for science in general, and biology in particular. <br />By setting aside state/phase-based physics, Rosen then proceeded to layout the groundwork for an atemporal relational biology based on functional organization and to methodically investigate the theoretical limits of mechanistic systems, including along the way: simulation, Turing machines, and the epistemology and ontology of such systems. The distinction eventually becomes clear that any such algorithmic mechanisms cannot embody the kinds of impredicative complexity that are characteristic of an organism. Because the syntax of Newtonian physics can express no such closed loops of entailment, &quot;life&quot; cannot even be described in that model of physics, much less modeled in any complete way. Thus it is that biological organisms are not a mere subset of current physics, but are representative of complexities that require physics to be enlarged.<br />In _Essays on Life Itself_, Rosen uses his considerable abilities across a broad spectrum of topics to continue the ideas from _Life Itself_. It is difficult to describe how topics as diverse as the assumptions of Pythagoras, the Turing test, universal unfoldings, morphogenesis, mind-brain problem, and more can be in the same book. Mostly, they all in one way or another accomplish one task: to look beyond the limits of how a problem is currently being viewed, and to see it from a larger perspective. Often, these perspectives take Rosen into terrain others would avoid, since they sometimes lead into the non-algorithmic / noncomputable, or the breakdown of the presumed subject-object division, or other kinds of &quot;messy&quot; scenarios. <br />Often they lead into &quot;complex systems&quot;, where Rosen uses the word &quot;complex&quot; to define a certain class of systems - those systems have symptoms of being: impredicative, non-algorithmic, context-dependent,semantic, nonformalizable. This classification is not a desire for obfuscation or ineffability, but is as rigorous as the nonformalizability of Number Theory or the unsolvability in closed form of the n-body problem. It is a complexity akin to the size of a transfinite number: it is not simply a matter of merely being hugely complicated, it is rather an entirely different order of system structure.<br />However, guided by Rosen, one does not feel uneasy following his path. Rather one feels enriched both in knowledge and in paradigm. Distinguishing the broader generic case from the degenerate or special is a characteristic theme in Rosen. The unfamiliar terrain he argues to is thus not some void, but a grander scale that subsumes the orthodox view. <br />In that grander view, it may become more clear that some problems are based on incorrect assumptions, while some are more difficult or complex than in the more limited original view. However, it is apparent that Rosen is uninterested in making problems appear simpler by ignoring those difficulties - he is interested in where the science leads. It is an immensely richer, complex view of the physical world that one comes away with. As such, it presents some difficult challanges, but it also opens up vast opportunities - opportunities not visible in the neat and tidy fantasy model of science that generally prevails where it is assumed that with enough effort everything can be reduced or calculated.<br />Rosen writes deliberately and with precision, and is both a critical and a profound thinker. I hope that he one day receives the recognition and admiration he rightfully deserves.	2002-11-15

(This is actually the English translation of his original French edition.)<br />Thom uses topology as his primary mathematical tool for describing and investigating catastrophes and stabilities. As such, this is primarily a qualitative, not a quantitative, approach.  The advantage of this is that it allows Thom to spend a great deal of time discussing general characteristics without getting bogged down in formulae or proofs. Indeed, the book is largely text, interspersed with graphs and only the occasional polynomial or differential equations.<br />And Thom is very insightful when discussing those general characteristics. Along the way he comments on everything from embryology to societal structures as viewed from the perspective of catastrophe theory. Much of the value of the book is buried not in the technical results as it is in his understated comments and speculations regarding the myriad of applications he investigates. Alot of careful and deep thought is present, and there is a significant amount of pregnant wisdom inside.<br />I originally came to read Thom via the profound books of theoretical biologist Robert Rosen. As someone not conversant in topology or catastrophe theory, I can say that there were some parts that were a technical struggle, but the content is well worth the effort. Someone versed in the math of dynamical systems and topology would be the more typical target audience.<br />But I stress again that the technical value is equalled or surpassed by the insights Thom brings to understanding physical systems of many types.<br />Since there are no publishers notes here on Amazon, I will list the table of contents for you:<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Introduction<br />Form and Structural Stability<br />Structural Stability in Mathematics<br />Kinematic of Forms; Catastrophes<br />Elementary Catastrophes on R4 Associated with Conflicts of Regimes<br />General Morphology<br />The Dynamic of Forms<br />Biology and Topology<br />Local Models in Embryology<br />Global Models for a Living Being (Metazoa)<br />Models in Ultrastructure<br />The Basic Problems of Biology<br />From Animal to Man: Thought and LanguageR4 Associated with Conflicts of Regimes<BR>General Morphology<BR>The Dynamic of Forms<BR>Biology and Topology<BR>Local Models in Embryology<BR>Global Models for a Living Being (Metazoa)<BR>Models in Ultrastructure<BR>The Basic Problems of Biology<BR>From Animal to Man: Thought and Language	2002-11-15

Most are less than a page long. This is not a guidebook in a conventional sense. The selections do not function as chapters, aphorisms or platitudes. Instead, they are meant to 'convey', in the same sense that each stanza of the Tao Te Ching conveys.<br />I find this style enjoyable and useful for two reasons. <br />First, it allows the reader to pick up the book on any page, read a topic, and reflect on it - just as one would with the Tao Te Ching. <br />Second, the shortness of each section tends to prevent a reader from focusing too intently on words and concepts, rather than embodying in themselves what has been conveyed by a particular selection. <br />It is appropriate that a guide like this is not &quot;in-depth&quot; in a cognitive sense. As the author says, &quot;The Tao is really simple; it is people who make it complicated. They must awaken from the complications they have created for themselves and dare to live a plain and truthful natural life.&quot;<br />Kudos go to the editor, too, for her choice of excerpts and the layout.	2002-11-14
US	51678985	R2GAJMUJ2FI8BV	0521478170	498133829	Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories	Books	3	36	42	N	Y	Very uneven, but still useful	As a topic in itself, category theory should need not to wait until grad-level to be described just because that may be when category theory's power can really begin to be exploited, but unfortunately, most of the category theory books I have looked at presume that level of mathematics.<br />Similar to what other reviewers noted, I would also say that this book demonstrates the potential of creating a good high-school/undergrad level intro to category theory. But unfortunately, that potential is not quite realized here.<br />There are hokey intermittent \\"conversations with students\\", as a tool to describe ideas, that are more distraction than aid. Some of the examples given are rather condescending in their simplicity. Yet, at other times the authors seem to breeze through more difficult topics with little or no examples. And the organization seems erratic - there is no clear sense of a gameplan as to where they are leading the reader or how all the concepts fit together. <br />Functors are surprisingly almost glossed over, as if they were relatively unimportant. There are exercises throughout the book, but with no answers provided, they are not really very helpful.<br />Having said all that, with some focused effort on the reader's part, the ideas do come forth, and admittedly, the authors do cover a fairly broad spectrum of aspects of category theory. This is certainly a non-trivial topic to try and teach, and an introductory book cannot be faulted for not carrying every notion to the nth-degree of either breadth or depth.  <br />Category Theory is one of those topics that (to me) appears 'ho-hum' until you see it actually applied to various topics. The authors have necessarily had to perform a balancing act between describing concepts while not getting caught up in excessively complex examples. I think this will leave many readers less than satisfied, but realistically, the book would have been twice as long had they really delved deeper into examples (or they would have had to be very terse in the actual descriptions of category theory, which is the choice most authors writing for a more mathematically-inclined audience seem to make - e.g., _Mathematical Physics_ by Geroch (good book!) or _Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists_ by Pierce).<br />If you are mathematically astute, you probably will find this book tedious. But if you are not a grad+ math major, then this book may well be worth the effort as a way to begin to learn a very profound and powerful set of tools and concepts.	2002-11-11

But it is much more than that. If you are interested in the human decisions behind why logics were built as they were, if you want to understand the impact of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, if you are interested in understanding philosophy of inferential systems in general, then you will find this book quite profound and useful.<br />Requirements for reading this book are roughly: a general knowledge of syllogistic and first-order predicate logic, an idea of what Godel's theorem is about and the concept of godel-numbering, some philosophy (e.g., ontology vs. epistemology), but mostly a keen interest at learning about logic and it's foibles and potentials.<br />Chapter 1 begins with the Hilbert program, and the attempt at axiomatization in general. Chapter 5 clears up alot of confusion about the Godel Incompleteness theorem and what it really means. He delineates between descriptive, semantic, deductive and Hilbertian completeness notions, and describes their inter-relatedness and Godel's theorem's role. These chapters alone are useful for gaining deeper understanding of the problems that arise in syntactic axiomatic deductive systems.<br />Chapter 7 is on the Liar Paradox, and he offers a unique solution to that based not upon Austinian notions, but rather based upon Hintikka's IF (\\"independence-friendly\\") first-order logic which avoids resorting to infinities or relying on any semantic re-interpretation (Hintikka uses a simple formal statement \\"~T[d]\\" where d is the godel-number of that statement, as the basis of the discussion). <br />He then goes on to discuss the presumed role of axiomatic set theory and chips away at it's pretense as a secure foundational approach.<br />But this merely scratches the surface. The book is primarily about the human decisions that were made, the reasoning behind them and why/where they failed. This is part of what makes it so readableand engaging. For Hintikka, logic and math seem to be very human activities, and there is no attempt to sanitize logic as being something pure or absolute. <br />As an explication of human decision-making in logic, I think this book has important insights buried within and consequences for the inferential world of logic and mathematics, as well as reasoning in general. It will take several readings to grasp it's profound implications.<br />'IF logic' itself (chapter 3) is a ridiculously simple and brilliant enhancement to first-order predicate logic, produced merely by lifting the mandatory left-to-right scoping restrictions Frege had placed on quantifiers in the syntax. And he extends (no pun intended) that notion by similarly lifting restrictions on mandatory scoping across operators as well. What arises looks very much like ordinary predicate logic, but the scoping independence opens up new vitality to the logic that makes it's applicability broader, as well as philosophically more interesting.<br />IF logic, in particular, is more amenable to being about imperfect information, and information independence (hence \\"independence-friendly logic\\"). Hintikka's version of truth-definition is about a verification game (as in game theory), not a Tarskian retreat to a metalevel of formalism. Throughout, there are these kinds of comments and concepts on relating logic back to the world.<br />IF logic is an intriguing example of how a subtle change in rules of syntax can have large consequences, and Hintikka is definitely pushing for it as -the- preferable first-order logic (actually, family of logics) over standard predicate logic. (And for game theoretical semantics and model theory as his preferred meta framework.) However, Hintikka's salesmanship aside, the insights in the book are not dependant on IF as being -the- alternative, but as a demonstration of those insights. <br />As a non-mathematician/non-logician, I had braced myself for a slog through a dry, tough read(particularly since there are nearly two decades of rust accumulated on my predicate logic skills) despite the positive reviews I had read on Amazon, but was pleasantly surprised at the lively writing style and also the modicum of formulae, with no tedious proofs to sweat over. Even the final chapter on \\"Epistemology of Mathematical Objects\\" is quite readable. And with some chapter headings like \\"Who's Afraid of Alfred Tarski?\\" and \\"Axiomatic Set Theory: Fraenkelstein's Monster?\\" you know the author enjoys his subject matter. :)	2002-11-05

Similar in layout to Tannock's _Medical Importance of the Normal Microflora_, this book consists of a series of papers written by researchers involved in the microflora of the intestinal system, and the effects of probiotic supplementation.<br />Probiotics are live microbes fed to a person or animal for the purpose of altering the microbial balance in the intestinal tract. What Tannock wants to convey with this book is that there are many claims made for probiotics, whether in animal feed or yogurt or supplements, but what in fact do they really do? And by what mechanisms do they work when they do have an effect?<br />The authors present information on understanding the microflora-host relationship, microflora-microflora relationships, methods of microflora identification, the methods and roles of genetically-modified intestinal microflora, microflora and the immune system, and the possible roles of methodical manipulations of prebiotics (as dietary additives) for the purpose of modifying intestinal microflora ecology.<br />The papers are written &quot;by scientists for scientists&quot;, and are of the quality one would expect in a peer-review journal on the topic. As such, the intended audience is those involved in this field. But those simply interested enough in the topic (like me)can still glean alot of useful information.<br />Yet, although much serious and in-depth information is presented, one comes away from this book with the realization that there is a tremendous amount that we still do not know about our intestinal ecology, something we typically imagine as not that complicated. <br />Indeed, as Tannock says in the Introduction: <BR>&quot;What can currently be said about the impact of probiotic bacteria on microbial balance at the moment? 'They go in one end of the digestive tract and come out the other, and hopefully something good happens along the way' is probably not too harsh a statement.&quot; <br />And his next sentence sums up the whole state-of-the-art:<br />&quot;Can anyone define the 'microbial balance' to which one aspires in the definition of a probiotic?&quot;<br />I give it 5 stars for it's competent and honest coverage of a rather ignored, yet vitally important, medico-biological topic.	2002-10-26

I give the book 5 stars for completing it's stated mission, being readable and enjoyable, and for not pandering to a lcd.<br />Kellert approaches this question from a philosophical, but down-to-earth, view. From the start, this is certainly not a &quot;gee-whiz&quot; hop-on-the-bandwagon book. In fact, the prologue begins: &quot;Chaos theory is not as interesting as it sounds. How could it be?&quot; <br />Yet, Kellert is not out to dismiss chaos theory, but rather to make sense of what the implications of chaos theory are. Unpredictability and determinism are two such topics potentially affected by chaos theory. Quantum mechanics is another topic influenced by chaos theory. And later in the book he ponders the historical question: why did it take so long for nonlinear dynamics (chaotic systems) to come under study?<br />There is very little math. The intended audience seems to be those who have some notion of chaos theory already, and although an introductory chapter is included, it would be helpful to understand conceptually what a Lyapunov exponent is and what bifurcation means. <br />The book is footnoted sufficiently but not overdone. It is heavily (but not annoyingly) referenced with everyone from Poincare to Prigogine. Despite the years that have passed since initial publication, I do not think this book has become obsolete. Another way to say this is: chaos theory (and it's results) is still not the mind-shattering revolution that some have made it out to be.<br />If you have some science and math background and have been asking yourself &quot;So, just what the heck does all this talk about chaos theory really mean??&quot;, then this book is for you.	2002-10-26

What I find most striking is the common yet generally unstated thread of how little we know of the complex interactions and dependencies involved in our symbiotic relationship with our microbial counterparts. It is not that the papers are uninformative - indeed, they are. However, they also display how much more there is left to study and understand. After reading this book, it is almost miraculous that we can maintain such a profound ecosystem within ourselves. <br />Of course, when this ecosystem fails for one reason or another, it can often be the onset of disease, and many of the papers are about 'abnormal' scenarios. This only further highlights the fundamental dependencies we have on our microbial partners and the urgency of understanding the breadth and depth of symbiotic relationships in humans (and other animals).<br />Another interesting thing about this symbiotic ecosystem is the specificity of it. Different people often may harbor different lactobacillus strains and those strains will not interchangably colonize in someone else, and the relative populations of various intestinal microbes may vary over months or years in an individual, and of course vary with diet. (See Tannock's book _Probiotics: A Critical Review_ for a very enlightening focus on this topic.)<br />The papers are written &quot;by scientists for scientists&quot;. So reading this book is like reading a series of articles in a peer-review journal. All papers are well-referenced, and well-written. There are no op-ed articles or attempts to make this a general readership book. However, it is largely accessible to any astute reader of scientific literature of a moderate degree. <br />I give it 5 stars not only for content and readability, but also for promoting an area of human biology that is too often ignored.	2002-10-24

It is accessible to the astute layperson - there is some occasional math, but the text handles most of the important concepts. It is useful for anyone interested in the combined scientific and philosophical perspective of space and time.<br />Reichenbach, in the Introduction, rues the current estrangement of philosophy and science, longing for the &quot;natural philosophy&quot; of the past, where thinkers were well-versed in both areas.<br />So this book takes us through the philosophy of space and time accompanied and supported by empirical and theoretical scientific work. He seems to have little in the way of agenda or &quot;-isms&quot; to tout, nor is he inclined to spend much ink on rehashing historical debates or trivial examples. And although the book winds it way eventually to General Relativity, we are thankfully not dragged through the typical &quot;Aristotlean view -&gt; Galilean view -&gt; Einsteinian view&quot; that is so commonly used.<br />Instead, he begins by discussing Euclidean space, the nature of geometry and so on. Throughout, the notion of topology is a common thread. Time, simultaneity, Lorentz, Principle of Equivalence, and gravitational effects on the topology of spacetime, are some of the steps through the book.<br />In section 39, for example, he guides us on a detour entitled &quot;The Analytic Treatment of Reimannian Spaces&quot;, just to carry &quot;...the treatment of general geometry a little further.&quot; In four short pages and a modicum of equations, the nature of tensors as a natural mathematical consequence appear, effortlessly and painlessly.<br />All along, woven in, are cogent philosophical treatments of the topic currently under discussion. The book is a good example of the author's desire to see philosophy and science melded again, and good example of his prowess in both areas.	2002-10-10

What will be more difficult, in fact, is successfully grasping the results of the arguments in their full profundity.<br />This book rightfully deserves to have as widespread paradigm-shattering impact on physical science as Godel's &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot; had on mathematics. <br />Rosen showed that, in fact, biology is not merely a trivial subcategory of physics; but instead that biology displays physical systems that are beyond the limited scope of current physics. And that enriching physics to encompass biological systems would enhance all of physics in very profound ways.<br />Sadly, I can only assume that it was (and still is) the ideological view of biology as a mere curiosity of physics that has allowed so many in science to fail to read Rosen's work.	2002-10-03

This could be instead considered a book on the philosophy of time with consideration of the GTR and using Godel's views on time and the GTR as a common thread.<br />As such, it is a difficult read. It will require of someone a fairly strong comprehension of philosophy and metaphysics, as well as (at least) a conceptual grasp of GTR, formal logic and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and some understanding of Cantor's transfinite numbers. <br />The philosophical references run from Plato and Aristotle to Kant and McTaggart. It is wide-ranging in it's coverage of differing views and how they relate to Godel's own views on time. Topics such as &quot;The Epistemology of Potential Infinity&quot; and &quot;Frege and the Decontextualization of Thought&quot; are representative of the depth of this book. Discussions of potential vs. actual infinities, truth in relation to time, the ontology of space-time diagrams, and so on, can leave one reeling.<br />In addition, comparisons between Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and his approach to his solutions to GTR are made, in hopes of elucidating Godel's ingenuity in finding unexpected solutions to various formalisms. <br />So, this book really attempts to go far beyond it's title. I think it generally succeeds, however, I find some of the organization of the book annoying, and I wish it were layed out differently. (However, in fairness, if it were my task I have no idea how I would go about reorganizing such complex material - it just seems that it could be done). The book is very heavily referenced (sometimes excessively it seems), and practically every page has at least two or three quotes. I think this tends to make the overall flow of writing less than natural, but it is a matter of style.<br />Finally, the appendix on Zeno's paradoxes is, to me, very well done and worth half the price of the book right there. Yourgrau clarifies in particular the issue of limits vs infinite sums, and all-in-all provides compelling reasons for claiming that Zeno's paradoxes remain unsolved despite some claims to the contrary.	2002-10-01

The author describes one incredible symbiotic relationship after another, in creatures ranging from bivalves to wild orchids.<br />Even though it appears to be aimed at the average reader, he does not 'dumb down' the text. (This is why I gave it the 5th star.) Latin species names are often used and words like 'oligotrich' and 'mycorrhizae' are strewn throughout the book, yet are explained well enough to make any science-phobe feel at home. <br />The book really focuses on describing symbiosis by example, and the non-trivial role of the microbial partners in those relationships. He also casts off the simplistic and anthropomorphic idea of &quot;competition&quot; in nature for a more natural, inclusive view. There is not much mention of Gaia (which is fine by me), and the latter part of the book relating to microbial symbiosis and evolution seems to pretty much recapitulate Lynn Margulis' theory of symbiogenesis.<br />(If symbiosis intrigues you, also see Lynn Margulis' &quot;Acquiring Genomes&quot; book for a more complete description of the intriguing theory of symbiogenesis, or Gerald Tannock's books for a professional-level description of all those hundreds of bacterial critters that occupy the human intestinal tract.)	2002-09-02

(I have not read other translations of the Hua Hu Ching for comparison, so I will not comment on that part of the book.)<br />With plain, direct, and gentle wording he gracefully illuminates. Yet, it is so worded such that each passage still leaves a silence at the end of it, offering the reader the space to dwell on that which cannot be put into words.	2002-08-30

As another reviewer noted, this book requires a pretty thorough understanding of both philosophical method and matters of science, including a grasp of quantum mechanics(not math-heavy, but having an idea of what a Hamiltonian is, for example).<br />Having said that, I find the book well-written, referenced, and closely argued. The author is up-front and explicitly lays out the three main theses she wishes to convey in the Introduction. <br />These theses, very briefly, are:<BR>1) Empirical success of physics theories argues for their truth but not necessarily their universality.<BR>2) Laws, where they do apply, hold only ceteris paribus.<BR>3) Our most wide-ranging scientific knowledge is the knowledge of the nature of things, not our knowledge of laws. The former being far more generative.<br />Continuing from her previous book, &quot;How the Laws of Physics Lie&quot;, the author argues that the 'laws' comprising science are not pieces of a grand unitary hierarchical schema of laws (towards the completion of which science is usually presumed to be headed), but rather that the relationship between laws is tenuous at best (hence, &quot;Dappled&quot; in the title). That the laws of nature are true ceteris paribus, and that their validity relies on &quot;successful repeated operations of a nomological machine&quot; (p. 50). A nomological machine being the selected components, capacities and situations that will repeatedly display the same behavior (the behavior that the resultant laws encode - typically with an implicit universal quantifier in front of them).<br />This is not anti-science or anti-realism or social constructivism. It is, however, explicitly anti-scientific-fundamentalism. The laws of science are not absolute and final, and an ideological belief in that absolutist view is misplaced. Science is a more complicated act than that and it is possible that &quot;reality may well be just a patchwork of laws&quot; (p. 34)	2002-08-30

The writing is terse and concise, as you would expect from a guide for professionals. As such it (unsurprisingly) uses dense medical terminology, and is not beginner-friendly.<br />However, in it's breadth of coverage, it necessarily skims the surface of most of it's topics. So, someone looking for in-depth information on any given topic will likely be disappointed. I suspect few vets (or advanced vet students) ever consult the MVM very often in their practice due to this limitation.<br />Further, constant advances in diagnosis and treatment will plague any printed guide, such as this, that will inevitably be dated as soon as it is printed.<br />But those are the inevitable constraints of writing a comprehensive guide such as this. All in all, it is a worthwhile book for the technically-inclined layperson or vet student to have at hand.	2002-08-12

I suspect Llinas is very much on the right track to illuminating the physical basis of consciousness. <br />Building chapter-by-chapter simultaneously on the apparent evolutionary development from the simplest neuronal system to the centralized brain, and on the results of brain scans and other experiments, Llinas brings us calmly and reasonably to the resultant human mind of today. <br />For Llinas, consciousness is the synchronized 40Hz firing of regions of the cortex over time. That is, consciousness is not just a given pattern of firing in 3-space, but is a 4-space relation. That additional dimension of time multiplies enormously the potential number of brain patterns that could occur in an individual. But it also makes the topic that much harder to study.<br />The writing feels like it has been written by someone who knows alot: there are many points where conceptual connections are not made entirely explicit (because it probably seemed so self-evident to Llinas) and the reader must fill in those gaps. Also, some of his non-neurologic language is quite technical: the description of the \\"self\\" as a calculated eigenvector, or the \\"vortex\\" which is essentially an attractor (as known in mathematics), that can make Llinas sound like a cold, hard-nosed scientist.<br />However, Llinas is refreshingly 'human'. For him, it is quite reasonable to assume (as a common consequence of evolution and similarity of brain structure) that many other species have forms of consciousness. Indeed, he devotes an entire chapter to qualia, and contends that qualia exist as essential brain feature, not only for humans but for cats and dogs and most other animals with brains of the same evolutionary genre (and that even in the case of invertebrate (octopus) brains he argues that the burden of proof is on those who would deny qualia).<br />One caveat: be aware that Llinas does not explicitly delineate between accepted facts and his theory - the book flows as one whole. It is not intented as deception. As he says in the preface \\"This book presents a personal view of neuroscience...\\".	2002-05-20

In the simplest terms, the brain seems to have a built-in ability to transcend the perception of the individual self&quot; (p.174)<br />Those brain states are not ones associated with delusion or imagination; instead they seem unique. And the authors then ask the question: &quot;why would our brain be structured in such a way as to accomodate this ability?&quot;<br />This book *IS* speculation. But that is not inherently a bad thing. The authors are exploring unknown territory: the possible relations between brain functions and spiritual/religious experiences. And they do so in a tentative, cautious tone with no pretense of having figured anything out, except that this is a profoundly intriguing topic. Indeed, it is the lack of determined opinion one way or the other that will likely infuriate the religious adherent AND the hard-nosed materialist.<br />It is an easy and lightweight read, and it's speculations should be held lightly. The chapters on brain function are *extremely* simplified (a source of infuriation for the hard-core 'scientific' readers), but sufficient to convey what is necessary to their discussions. Likewise, the breadth/depth of the spiritual/religious topics are highly simplified and generalized. But again, this book is not meant to be exhaustive on either area - it is only a conveyance of some interesting speculations. <br />If you like a book that can pique your interest without giving you mountains of data or any definite final answers, then you might enjoy this one.	2002-05-10

There Searle reviews many authors including Dennett. As do I, Searle also consider's Dennett \\"imprecise and evasive\\" (p.115), and as he says \\"I regard Dennett's denial of the existence of consciousness not as a new discovery or even a serious possibility but rather a form of intellectual pathology.\\"(p.112)	2002-04-22

There is limited reliance on math, and the text is clear enough that one can even gloss over much of the math that is there.<br />Importantly (I think), is the even-handed portrayal of the standard interpretation of QM and how it's apparent acceptance in the mainstream is neither historically nor logically fully supported. The assumption that because reality appears to follow the mathematical formula does not necessarily imply that the interpretation of the formula 'explains' the basis of reality or even that QM constitutes the most basic level of reality. <br />The author uses many quotes, but always in a way that fits in nicely with the storyline.<br />Although, ostensibly written around a critique of Everett's contributions to QM, the author seems more to use that more as a reference or counterpoint for his own exposition of the problems and issues regarding QM.	2002-04-20

This view is neither a flavor of behaviorilism nor any other kind of reductionist attempt to deny consciousness. Indeed, consciousness retains it's unique position in his model without the kind of apologetic argument or mysticism (of the kind that usually occurs as a result of unwittingly thinking in the Cartesian dilemma mindset).<br />Most shocking to me was the way in which Searle argued that the mind is not and cannot be an information processing system. As counterintuitive and remarkable as that may sound, it is quite apparently true after reading his arguments. He is not saying that we do not *think*, but rather that equating *thinking* and *information processing* is in error, primarily because the interpretation of symbols, syntax and semantics requires an outside intelligence to make the interpretation, so to say that we are information processing machines makes no sense for it is exactly our own intelligence that we are trying to explain. The devastating impact for AI and cognitive science from this viewpoint is also duly noted in a rather understated way.<br />Likewise, the 'unconscious' loses it's imagined place as part of the mind, replaced with an equally (or perhaps moreso)complex 'Background' of non-conscious and potentially-conscious components. Also, so many activities of the brain that have been deemed as &quot;mental&quot; turn out to have no basis for such an ascription: it turns out they are anthropomorphisms placed on neurobiological processes that neither have intentionality nor mentality. As a result (my opinion), much of psychology and probably many theories of neurobiology are as wayward as their AI counterparts.<br />In the end, the 'mind' that one is left withremains utterly rich and complex, with consciousness and all subjective experience intact and valid. However, now bereft of the possibility of computational models and rules and such to understand the brain in an abstracted programmatic way, and bereft of anthropomorphisms of lower-level brain functioning, we find that the brain is an organ - an organ of great ability and complexity that will require an immense effort to understand and appreciate.	2002-04-20

However, I found it quite incoherent.<BR>The book intersperses a few smidges of science history (double-slit experiment, equation for special relativity, etc.) with (what I found to be) mostly unclear and poorly structured 'arguments'. When I got to the section on &quot;Light as an Intercellullar Medium&quot; I was glad the end of the book was near. <BR>As someone used to reading philosophy and quantum mechanics I usually feel at home with complex, mind-bending arguments. But, sadly,  here I can find no coherence to the words on the pages.	2002-04-20

I consider this book a gem.<br />The forthright explanations of mechanistic systems, both deterministic and indeterministic, will help to awaken any student of physics as to the degree to which their world-view may not be as broad as they had imagined.<br />The concerns raised about quantum mechanics are not trivial or extreme. And they are raised with deliberation and humility. Likewise, so are Bohm's suggested solutions.<br />Finally, and most importantly I think, the argument for a world-view of physics that presumes - as the most scientifically (investigationally speaking) useful view to take -  that the universe is comprised of an infinite number of levels of depth and complexity. Perhaps there are not an infinite number of levels of reality, but to presuppose there is opens the mind to want to investigate what they might be. Thus, supposing that QM defines and &quot;explains&quot; the 'bottom' of reality is first, not a logically strong position (just as Brownian motion formulas do not &quot;explain&quot; such motion as a fundamental aspect of nature) and secondly, such a view is scientifically inhibiting: supposing that QM *is* the bottom level of reality is rather silly in light of our historical knowledge of how humans have consistently misjudged the 'fundamental' aspects of nature in the past, and supposing we have reached it now via QM is a dubious claim. Further, even the issue of determinism vs. indeterminism may be a moot point: it may be at a lower level of reality, there is no such distinction - we may be seeing those two 'macroscopic' aspects of a more basic or inclusive feature of reality.<br />If you want to be an original thinker in physics (or perhaps any science or philosophy), this book is a good starting point to help you realize how easily assumptions of the nature of reality slip past our awareness.	2002-04-20

(For that this book gets its 2 stars.)<BR>However, the careful physicist becomes a loose cannon in later chapters, with offhand definitions of &quot;alive&quot; suddenly being given with no detailed attempt at explanation or support(consider this snippet: &quot;Your hair is alive and so is your heart. But your heart is much more alive than your hair.&quot;), and bizarre appeals to emotion and authority that demonstrate the non-sequitor nature of these later chapters. The numerous citings of Plato and other ancient Greek sages is also supposed to convince us that we are only rediscovering (via quantum mechanics) what has been known all along.<BR>The attempt is further made to reconcile quantum mechanics with the process philosophy of A. N. Whitehead. If you were predisposed to Whitehead's philosophy (personally, it does intrigue me somewhat) then you might be interested in the proposals, but otherwise the exercise only stretches one's imagination and patience that much further.<BR>The use of contrived dialogues among imaginary people (in what I can only assume is an homage to Plato) as a way to explain aspects of quantum mechanics is more a nuisance than an aid, and the dialogues of the later chapters are like the chatter of cult members trying to indoctrinate a new recruit rather than any deeply reasoned Socratic argument.<BR>To achieve a stance of mysticism does not and should not require such torture of reason.<BR>If you have previously read Frank Tipler's Physics of Immortality, then you will understand what I mean when I say: what starts out as an apparently studiously crafted book turns out to be a frantic, speculative, and poorly reasoned conclusion.	2002-03-30
