If you loved the Alex Cross series, and I did, you're probably in for a big disappointment.<br />I'd only normally review books I like, share the pleasure.  This one however really got my goat up.<br />Felon of the story - Nicholas Jenks, cynical, twisted author.  Hopefully little of Patetrson in the character.  But the book oozes with cynicism ... the killer who's not a killer, who is a killer, wrapped round over a hundred mini-chapters in 4th grade English.<br />The book gets progressively worse.  Would love to hear more women's persepective on the story, but the characters seem so unreal and superficial.<br />Sorry, this one is for the remainder pile	2002-03-09

This is very much outside the style of his previous writing and very welcome for being so.<br />I highly recommend this book.  I've read, and passed on all his previous books to friends (like a joke, great to share but you don't necessarily want to hear/read it again).  This one will stay on my bookshelf - it may be a few years again before its re-read, but it will be.<br />Nice one John!	2001-02-20

Thanks Michel!	This is a sensational course, you just listen.  No books, no assingments and it really works.<br />I can't recommend this course highly enough.  There is a two tape/CD course and an eight tape/CD course.  The 8 uses the same 2 as the starting section.  TRy either but you are likely to decide to go on with the whole thing after experiencing the two.  Brilliant man, brilliant teacher.<br />Buena suerte!	2000-11-03

Politicians of both side of the devide are given equal voice and noted for both positive and negative achievements, similarly with English, Spanish, French, Black and Indian roles in American hsitory (or is it America's role in their histories?).<br />Making the complex simple without making it stupid is the mark of a great summarizer, Axelrod does it extremely well.<br />Buy the book.

Badly recalled, but you get the idea.<br />So why gripe about this book?<br />I think it fails in both areas, one to provide an interesting introduction to the subject and two to have any obvious practical application.<br />If you are looking for a good introduction to Philosophy then Brain Magees Dorling Kindersley intro is great, or if in a more imaginative approach then Sophie's World is great.<br />If you are looking for some inspiration to shore you up (&quot;Consolations&quot;) then there are upteem Self-Help books that will do the job much better.<br />Overall, a good work of erudition, but really not very interesting.  Perhaps it deserves the Consolation Prize.	2000-09-27

I love this book.<br />I don't now why, I popped into my local bookshop and this book just lept into my hands and then into my heart.<br />The offical reviews will tell you the content, so let me tell you what it did for  me.<br />It isn't a fine peice of literature, well not in the sense of poetic  writting; but it is amaster of abook in having a timeless tale that really  touches the heart. From chapter to chapter it fils you with hope, hope for  the characters when things are bad, hope for their continued happiness when  things are good.<br />I had to take breaks during the last 30 pages, they are  so emotionally rich, its hard to take more than a few pages at a time. Have  some tissues with you, heart moving stuff.<br />Although this is a novel or  parable, its message is very simple to put into everyday life. Be it small  or large, Paying It Forward is agreat message for both the reader and the  world.<br />Enjoy, I know you will.	2000-07-12

Victoriana revealed, along the lines of The Elephant Man.   This too would make a marvelous movie.<br />The tale revolves around two  minds, similar but yet so different.  The scholar James Murray, compiler of  the Oxford English Dictionary, and Dr Minor, an American sugeon who is a  voluntary contributor to the dictionary's word  &quot;database&quot;.<br />After many years collaboration, Murray tracks down  the elusive Dr Minor to a mental home and discovers the true tale behind  his mysterious colleage and vital contributor to the  dictionary.<br />Facinating stuff and true too.<br />Exciting, mysterious with  strong emotional overtones. This book combines human interest with history,  a bit like Caleb Carr's The Alienist, but true.<br />This is a very  well-writen book, that I only wish was a little longer.<br />I hope you enjoy  this book as much as I did.	2000-06-30

This is probably one of the least useful Japanese language learning tools I've bought.<br />In fairness to the Author(s), it does cover what it claims, it will.  It just isn't really very useful or interesting.<br />Everything is  in romaji which makes the book limited in application and at the same time  the 501 verbs really only cover a few different verb types.

If you're going to use at at a desk or  carry in bag then Kodansha's &quot;Compact&quot; Kanji Guide is a lot  better albeit a little larger (800 pages)<br />Production quality: The paper  quality is poor, rough paper, this compares to the &quot;Compact&quot;  Guide which is much nice on the hand and eye.<br />Content: The  &quot;Compact&quot; Guide uses exactly the same format as the pocket guide,  indices etc but covers all 1945 Joyo Kanji vs the more limited 1006 Kyoiku  Kanji in the Pocket Guide.<br />Legibility The font size is extremely small in  the Pocket guide (much smaller than the compact) - it makes it hard to read  (both the Japanese characters and translation).  Again, the compact is much  easier on the eye.<br />A lot of these problems good have been solved in a  agenuine pocket format by reducing the number of compounds to 2-3 per kanji  and having larger, easier to read characters.<br />All seems like a bit of a  compromise.	2000-06-09

I bought a copy of this when it first came out and then volume 2  too.<br />It's good!<br />But there's better.<br />I'd recommend Ken Henshall's &quot;Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters&quot; by Tuttle as much  better.<br />For one, the Henshall book gives memory guides based on  historical research on derivation, ie some academic basis, unlike  Heisig's.<br />For two, Henshall gives the Japenese reading of the character  (so you can pronounce it and look up words with it in dictionaries).<br />For  three, Henshall also gives compounds in which the character is used.<br />For  four Henshall gives strokes, which allows the reader to then look up the  character in other dictionaries (as does the reading).<br />Now the Heisig  book is good, but you need to buy all of them to get what you get in one  book from Henshall.<br />No, I'm not Henshall's agent! I'm a sucker for buying  anything on Kanji and just think their are easier tools around.
