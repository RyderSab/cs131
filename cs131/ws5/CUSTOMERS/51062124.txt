The most glaring example is a review by the authors ex (presumably).  He takes a book filled with emotional abuse, rape, disloyalty and such and complains that the author is deceptive because she wrote that her mother in law visited once  \\"the next day\\" as opposed to two or three days later.<br /><br />This is the kind of minor mistake one would expect from someone telling the truth, an unreliable witness on the other hand would have given us the exact time down to the minute, as if an action would be different if it happened on a Tuesday instead of a Wednesday.  In any case, what would one expect from an ex-spouse?  At least he doesn't mention in the review that he believes his ex is lying about her father, he mostly complains she was mean to his mother, so I guess we can assume he believes that she was indeed raped, but that she just can't remember the exact day her mother in law visited.  Oh dear.<br /><br />In trying to determine whether I felt that she is telling the truth, and I believe she is, even if a few details are sketchy (again, I'd expect this from someone telling the truth) I thought to myself, hey, if this writer is making all this up, she's as good as Pat Conroy, and guess what?  I don't believe any woman, yes I'm a c.p, in this aspect, I don't believe any woman can write nearly as well as Conroy, so in a round about, back handed way, I believe she's telling the truth because I don't think she could be that good of a fiction writer.<br /><br />This book obviously stirred up some strife in the Mormon community.  Oh well, here is a group of people that believe some guy in the early 1800's dug up some gold plates  and translated \\"reformed\\" Egyptian writing to deliver the message to the world that all groups have it wrong, but I've got it right.  The day I find myself in a church that claims that its variety is the \\"one and only\\" true way is the day I shake the dust off my shoes as I quickly exit stage left.  Not to say I'm not a born again evangelical, I am, but that anyone claiming some new message is, in the words of Saint Paul, a messenger of the evil one.  The bottom line is that LDS are in a self refuting position, looked at logically, but I digress.<br /><br />One of the interesting things I read in this book was that the book Pearl of a Great Price was translated by Smith from some old papyrus that was bought off a guy traveling around with some Egyptian mummies back in the early 1880's (in Ohio).  Funny thing is, he made it all up.  Faked it.  He couldn't have known that in the 1960's the papyrus would show up again and that it'd just be some common old stuff like Egyptian Book of the Dead variety.  Anyone staying in the Mormon Church after knowing those set of facts is just comfortable allowing themselves to be fooled because change is tough.  And personal responsibility is tough.  Heck, life is tough, but I agree with the authors assertion that living in a lie is not worth the price, any price.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this work to any interested in modern Mormon culture.<br /><br />Also to those interested in the sexual abuse that is, alleged by the author (and I agree), much more common in Mormon communities than in the general population, especially when it comes to incestuous abuse.  Think Elizabeth Smart here.  She was, I conjecture, probably sexualized by a close relative and thus conditioned and primed for the abuse she took for months by a crazy Fundamentalist Mormon that thought he needed another wife.<br /><br />Imagine a culture that would condition a young woman to attach herself to a grown adult that snuck off with her in the middle of the night to have sex in the woods.  My own teenager, and probably yours or your sibling or yourself if you're a young teenager would have fought and screamed at some point, if not that night being threatened by a knife then some other night.  Instead, the young Smart simply took on the role of dutiful and submissive wife, and I think a reading of this book will give a good over view of why this happened.  It's the culture.<br /><br />To be well rounded, I'd like to mention that I don't agree with the authors seemingly pantheistic, every road leads there, type of spiritual world view.  However, since she came out of such an abusive, mind controlling religious system, I'm going to give her some slack here.<br /><br />Again, I do recommend this book, it's an interesting and informative read and I believe told from the authors heart with an intention of being truthful.oung teenager would have fought and screamed at some point, if not that night being threatened by a knife then some other night.

The later editions correct five minor factual errors the author admits to making, simple errors that don't change the context or story much if at all.<br /><br />As for the supposed major errors and \\"one-sidedness\\" of the work, well, some of it will always be up for conjecture or guess work, however, one cannot, with a straight face at least, claim that the author here is simply just trying to make the Mormon Church or its members look bad, he lays out too much of the story in facts that are indisputable.<br /><br />He claims that he had to present a general overview of Mormon history, obviously much of the \\"bad\\" stuff, to give a back drop to the overall story of the Lafferty brothers killings in 1984.  I agree and I was thoroughly captivated reading about it, in fact, I'm very interested in getting the book on the killings done by the pipe bomber that was blackmailing the church (the author of the infamous Salamander Letters).  Fascinating reading.<br /><br />For those that are offended by this work, and  I suppose generally speaking only a Mormon could be offended, I wonder what it is about history, facts and one man's opinion that is so offensive.  And I concede here, as you may well of noticed, that some of it is simply \\"one's man opinion\\", however, based upon the research he's done, it's an opinion worth listening to and being offended by it is grade school stuff, better left to grade school kids, not grown adults.<br /><br />If the simple fact that the Mormon Church has secret and hidden documents and that they submitted to black mail to keep you (yes I mean \\"you\\" in both the church member and non member sense) from seeing some letters they obviously thought were authentic (but later turned out to be forgeries) doesn't bother you, then live on in peaceful ignorance, and my God bless you.  However, if you actually want to use that gray matter that God endowed you with, read this and other critical books, it's your critics that have the most to teach you.<br /><br />I often debate with my atheist dad.  I'm never offended and often learn new things by hearing out his criticisms.  I don't think that talking to him or reading his emails is going to send me to hell or some other horrible fate any more than I think a Mormon reading this book will be damaged by the examination of facts.  The fact that the \\"church\\" would dissuade you from reading it is scary, if you think about it.<br /><br />In any case, for any interested in Mormon history and the general story of the Lafferty killings in 1984, I strongly recommend this work, it was well written, informative and entertaining to boot.and one man's opinion that is so offensive.

I enjoyed Wild at Heart and I'm giving this book a strong recommendation for both men and women alike.  I won't say that this offering is as good as Waking the Dead, or as much of an impact to a man was Wild at Heart was, however, I still believe that Christian men will gain a lot of understanding from reading this as I did.<br /><br />There is of course a group of Christians out there that doesn't believe that God actually speaks to people today.  Okay for them, however, I'd not listen to them, if God is that silent, they are fools too.  As for the Eldridge's style of using books, movies and the like to create word pictures and draw analogies from, well if they are wrong then C.S. Lewis and Tolkien were idiots too I guess.  Gee, you'd think John was selling dope on a street corner the way some Christians bash him.  Oh Well.<br /><br />In any case, if you liked earlier works by Eldridge, you'll probably enjoy this one too, if not, then you probably won't.<br /><br />One negative reviewer wrote that there is a  \\"strange emphasis\\" on spiritual warfare.<br /><br />Think about that one.  A strange emphasis indeed.  I wonder if Paul ever taught about standing firm against the schemes of the devil or if Peter ever mentioned that the devil is like a lion seeking out whom he might destroy or if Jesus ever mentioned something about a thief that comes to steal and destroy.  Ummmm.  Well maybe not.<br /><br />Perhaps all this talk about spiritual warfare was just for \\"back in the day\\" after all, if one looks around this planet it's hard to see any destruction, I mean, heck, it's all peace and jelly beans.<br /><br />I give the book a strong recommendation to Christian women and the to the men that love them.	2005-06-24

A throughly funny read, however, and well worth picking up, it should be rated four and three quarters or so.<br /><br />I read it again so I could go see the movie with the novel freshly on my mind.  The last time I read the story was many years ago, and I have heard it as a book on tape (which was really good too).<br /><br />The humor is definately more clear as an older adult, if you read this book back in the eighties, like I did, and haven't read it since, it's time to pick it up again.  It's not long and can be read in a few hours, it's worth a few laughs and at the very least will prepare you to see the movie that just came out.<br /><br />Cheers, and thanks for all the fish.	2005-06-14

It should also be read if you are involved in service work that has a digital component. If you're a teacher or going to school (now or in the future) you should read this book.  If  you're a politician or if you plan to be or if you vote you should read this book.<br /><br />Is off shoring or out sourcing all bad?  How does the current trend towards vast multinational supply chaining help reduce the likelihood of war?  How did UPS help change the word?  These and many other questions are addressed in this work.<br /><br />On night, as I was in the middle of reading this book, a bunch of us were heading to dinner and started comparing leather jackets.  I asked everyone where their jacket was made, the results:  two in China, one each in Korea, Italy and New Zealand.  This book takes a look at how the world has become so flat that the future will hold much more of the same kind of mix in many areas of commerce.  A future group of us going to dinner may very well have jackets made in third world countries that we barely know the names of and this is a good thing, the author argues, because it raises the standard of living for everyone involved and helps promote a climate of peace and cooperation among the worlds nations.<br /><br />Much of the work here is explaining the how's and why's of how the world became \\"flat\\", the different companies and technology that made it happen as well as the trends that had profound effects worldwide.  This is all interesting reading for any that enjoy a historical look at how things happen, but more important, it forms a sort of looking glass into the future and allows us to see where we are headed.  The future holds many more promising advances and the more we can bring free trade and information (teaching and learning) to the poorer countries in the world, the more we can stamp out terrorism and the like.<br /><br />My one minor complaint about the work is the authors cheap shots at the work Bush has done to fight terrorism.  I disagree with the authors assessment of Bush, however, I do agree with his belief in how we can eventually win against it, it is something I've preached for years.  Bring everyone the opportunity and climate to take their kids to the mall, stop at McDonalds for a Happy meal and then go home to barbecue and swim in the pool and the end result is that war/terrorism becomes something that is far from ones mind.<br /><br />When people don't have economic opportunity, and can't explain to their children why they can't have a decent lunch, or worse, their children are slowing dying of disease and mired in poverty, then terrorism and war become common place.  This book addresses many ways in which the world becoming \\"flat\\" makes it a better place for us all.

When I told a pastor friend of mine a short time ago that I was ready to start pursuing a relationship again he recommend this book.  When I noticed that it referred to itself as a guide to couples I thought maybe he'd made a mistake recommending it to me, however, as soon as I started getting into it I realized why he thought it'd be helpful to read even before I got into a relationship.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to both couples in crisis and those just trying to make things better as well as to any, like myself, that simply want to work on knowing ourselves better before getting into a relationship.  It is also very helpful in being able to form insight into how others relate to us in a relationship, why they expect what they do and why we expect what we do.<br /><br />Some of the author's insight into how childhood wounds effect us are very helpful in seeing how some of our personality gets formed and how those traits affect both our partners and ourselves.  When two people start a relationship they both have expectations, conscious and subconscious, of what they expect the other person to do for them.  Obviously in a healthy relationship both people are trying to love and give to the other person because giving and loving and being unselfish are traits we all recognize as being \\"good\\" and honourable and most healthy people desire to be good or Godly in some form or another.<br /><br />What is not so obvious, and what I found most helpful in my reading of this book, is that people go into a relationship with the expectation that the other person will heal us where we were wounded and hurt as children.  This unconscious desire to have our partners fill the need left behind by our less than perfect parents often is the cause of the ensuing battles and eventual breakdown of relationships.  Often the net result of this inability to get our partners to heal us is divorce.<br /><br />I feel very positive about what I learned in this book and while certainly no panacea, I believe that anyone with an open mind and a desire to learn about themselves and have a greater empathy for their mates will get something positive here.  I give it a strong recommendation to both married couples and those that intend to be in the future.ainly no panacea, I believe that anyone with an open mind and a desire to learn about themselves and have a greater empathy for their mates will get something positive here.

I'm almost done with my second reading and I'll probably go through at least parts of it again.<br /><br />John has a way of explaining the workings  of eternal truths by using both everyday examples and mythic stories that we all know and love.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that our hearts, once redeemed by Christ, are good and that being fully alive and living the abundant life Jesus promised is accomplished by recognizing that our hearts are good (it is our flesh that still struggles with sin and union with the world) and living in intimacy with God.<br /><br />There is a good point he makes about living the Christianity of \\"tips and techniques\\" which reminded my of Dallas Willards point about how many live a life of \\"sin management\\" in his wonderful book The Divine Conspiracy.  I believe Waking the Dead  is as great and as important as this other work and has the benefit of being a little bit easier to read.<br /><br />Of course there is always controversy, and this is no exception, however I'm going to make the bold statement that any that criticize this work (overall as opposed to a minor point or two) have no real idea about who Christ really is or what his mission on earth was and still is.  There are many religious people that seem good intentioned, they often write well meaning reviews here, however, remember what Jesus said about those that are like the cup that has been cleaned on the outside but not the inside, because those are the kind of people that write negative reviews for books like this.<br /><br />If you want freedom and intimacy with God, read this book.<br /><br />If you want to live under a god of your own creation,  making yourself right all the time, then go ahead and forego a journey through these pages based upon the negativity of those that live religious and well meaning lives but know little about true love, true passion, true intimacy, true life and true friendship.sion, true intimacy, true life and true friendship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-27

It's really simple, they don't read and study books like this one that give such logical and simple advice.  The average person simply doesn't spend the time to understand what they are doing and many of those that follow the markets more closely get overly optimistic and allow emotion to take control.<br /><br />Mr. Muzea writes in a basic and easy to understand style and includes many short anecdotal stories to flavor and explain his reasoning.  I found the book to be forthright and entertaining.<br /><br />His basic premise is that large investing insiders can give huge clues to the over or under valuation of a stock and by following their lead, along with some basic technical analysis one can greatly increase his chances of selling near tops and buying near bottoms.  He runs a service and newsletter that gives up to date information and advice, however I didn't feel like this book was at all a selling tool for his service (like I've found in some other investment type books).  This book can stand on its own and one quick reading can easily make an investor money and/or save an investor from loss.<br /><br />The author has developed a method he calls the \\"Magic T\\" it's not a hocus pocus for divining what stocks will win and which will lose, but rather a basic decision making device (much like a pro and con sheet that is a bit more advanced).  How he applies this to investments is, by its self, well worth the price of the book.<br /><br />All in all I give a strong recommendation for this book  to any investor or trader that is looking to improve their profits as well as to any that are considering entering the market for the first time.	2005-03-14

Books	2	8	17	N	N	Not above average imo	[...]<br /><br />First off the story is told in a format and style that is probably the biggest mistake a author can make, that being that the information is told to the reader instead of being shown to the reader.  This type of writing can sometimes pass in a good non fiction book, but in a fictional novel it is a death bell.<br /><br />For those that haven't read such books as The First Five Pages, On Writing, Techniques of the Selling Writer, and other books on the craft of writing the main difference between \\"telling\\" and \\"showing\\" is simple.  In telling an author states things like \\"Joe was tall and could run really fast.\\"  In showing an author writes things happening (action) and the reader figures out that Joe is tall and a fast runner through the action and dialogue.  The difference is night and day.<br /><br />Anyway, I may be far from the best at explaining good writing, but I understand the mechanics of it and can spot mistakes.  In this novel the writing is like  the former example, in which facts are  given as story, action lacking, the art of showing missing.  In my opinion, this form of writing is laborious and  boring.<br /><br />Another huge problem is believability.  Two friends in the novel  are high school sophomores and they both break the world record in the 100 meters the same day racing each other.  Not only is this not believable on its face, one of the friends wasn't even a track and field guy to begin with.  Then they both go on to have perfect lives along with a third friend.  This isn't just not believable, it's hardly interesting, until, of course, the conflict hits.  But here, again, it's totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Would you buy the idea that the rich daughter of a pro sports team would pay a rookie player three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to give an illegal hit to a guy that told her he didn't want to have sex with her?  I couldn't.  A woman asking a drunk stranger to sleep with her and getting rejected, even if he is a pro football player, isn't enough of a history to justify the resulting conflict.  Sorry.<br /><br />As for the O.J.-ness of the trial part of the story,[...] The author claims (in the jacket information) he was upset about the Simpson trial, but doesn't clarify whether he meant because Simpson was indicted  or because he was let off for murder.  In either case, I don't get how this plays into the novel here.<br /><br />As for this book being a positive role model for blacks, or a real look into black life, I could hardly disagree more.  How many people, black or white, actually make it into the pro level of sports?  How many could run world record 100 meter dashes in the tenth grade?  To be a positive influence I think a book would have to have a bit more of a grasp on reality.<br /><br />All that said, I'm sorry I couldn't be more positive, but I try to be honest in my reviews and I try to relate how something made me think and feel, more than just giving editorial on the plot or relating the story line.  I can't recommend this novel to those that expect crisp, well written fiction, it would pass as a rough draft, a potentially good story in the making.story to justify the resulting conflict.

That can be a good thing, but it can also be a bit distracting, I enjoy DeMilles later works that have a single protagonist and follow that characters POV most of the way a bit more than I like this format.<br /><br />This isn't the type of book to read a bit then go back to, it's the type of book that's best read straight through in a single weekend or vacation or similar time to get absorbed simply because it's easy to get lost on who is who and what's going on.<br /><br />I think this is the last of DeMille's books for me, I'll have to wait until the next one comes out or go back and reread Gold Coast.  He's a very good author and this book is no exception.  I believe  another movie is on the way, Up Country, featuring the same character that was the protagonist in The Generals Daughter.  I hope it's done well.<br /><br />If you haven't read DeMille yet, this is a good place to start as any if you like action, intrigue spy thrillers, if you want more of a serious single POV plot, try Gold Coast or Word of Honor, both novels that are among the best I've ever read.	2005-02-02

Much like the novel By the Rivers of Babylon, this novel has a big cast of characters and lots of action and intrigue.  DeMille captures the politics involved and shows some evil and good on both sides of the fight.<br /><br />One of the reasons I love DeMille so much is unfortunately missing in this novel, and that's a first person point of view protagonist.  However, there is one main character that is hero of the novel, and while not quite as good, it's reads great and overall the whole story is great.<br /><br />No need to go over the plot line and details again, so I'll just say that if you enjoy DeMille, you'll like this one too, if you've never read him, well, this is as good a place to start as any, but keep in mind that some of his other novels are quite different.<br /><br />DeMille is a great novelist if you haven't tried out some of his stuff, you're missing out.	2005-01-15

There are some tidbits here of his fight with Newt and I think the whole story, done like Klein did the fictional Clinton story in Primary Colors, would have made a great novel or even a great nonfiction book about that historic bit of Capital Hill history.  Perhaps the author could have hired a ghost writer and simply told the story, it may have made a great book, however, I digress a bit.<br /><br />There is a lot in this book about what's wrong with our current system, however, the problem isn't that we don't know what's wrong, the problem is that most Americans want to live in some kind of socialistic state.  If that weren't the case, we'd be electing more people that have libertarian leanings, but were not.<br /><br />People complain that big money ruins politics, and that topic is well covered in this book, however original solutions aren't really here, other than, as he writes near the end, we need to elect more people that say they'll cut spending and have integrity.  Okay.  I kind of like the solution that Carville suggests in his book, whatever dollar amount the incumbent has for his campaign, the state matches it for the challenger.  I doubt will ever see such an idea happen, but it's a thought.  However even that idea doesn't address the changing of actions of politicians once they get to Washington, they'd still be beholden to special interests.<br /><br />The bottom line is that humans tend to be self serving and while some like Scarborough really do leave Washington and really do work towards real reform, most don't.  Most politicians are, pardon my choice of words, whores.  They sell out because, in the end, it's the path of least resistance and seemingly the only way to get things done.<br /><br />I only gave this book a three star rating because it's too short and too jumpy and well, just written in an average way.  Like Hannity, I think Scarborough has five star ideas and is a great public speaker, however, when it comes to writing, I think they'd both be better served by having ghost writers take their ideas and thoughts and polish them into better works.  Anyway, that's my opinion.<br /><br />I do recommend this work, it does have some good thoughts about changing politics and I think he's given praise, near the end, to the next President of the United States, however to see who that is, you'll have to pick up the book.Scarborough has five star ideas and is a great public speaker, however, when it comes to writing, I think they'd both be better served by having ghost writers take their ideas and thoughts and polish them into better works.

US	51062124	R37CZGL6CTBLRD	0446301582	714221261	Word of Honor	Books	5	10	12	N	Y	This novel is huge, giant, awesome and then some.	This novel is one of the most well crafted pieces of fiction I've ever read, it carefully and brilliantly intertwines a present day controversy with a torrid tale of misconduct in Vietnam.  The mystery is revealed to the reader bit by bit while the protagonist is tugged left and right by various agencies of the government and his own family.<br /><br />DeMille's style of writing gives a strong male protagonist that I can only suppose tends to reflect the authors own humor and sarcasm as well as honor, integrity and outlook on the world.  He gives is opinion on many subjects, however, the often uncomprehendible  stupidity of the government and its peter principle type workers come within the sights of his weaponized wit most often and with the greatest humor and insight.<br /><br />I enjoy DeMille's writing because I like and root for his main characters, usually written in the first person he gives life to a person I'd like to call friend.  The plots are always exciting and fast paced, page turning and well constructed.  This work is now my second favorite, but only by a hair, behind The Gold Coast.  Because it's a different kind of story, I can easily say that this work is the best of it's type I've ever read by far.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to any that enjoy war type stories, lawyer type stories or simply stories about man's inner struggle to live honorably and still always do what's right in a sometimes cloudy world of law and justice.  This is, to say again, a huge novel and one of the best I've ever read.	2005-01-08

It's hard to have a strong novel when so much of it is told in the past tense, by several different viewpoints, with no strong antagonist (or protagonist either, really) and seemingly no present danger.  Near the end, there is some present action and danger, but it comes late, almost too late, and is quickly resolved.<br /><br /> Normally a story moves along with the protagonist getting into trouble as he travels towards a goal of some sort.  Finding the killer, figuring out a mystery, blowing up a bridge, getting the girl, that sort of thing.<br /><br />King decides to tackle some unanswerable questions about life and that  becomes the strength of the book, however, if your looking for a scary story or lots of tension and worse, for a strong resolution, you're going to be disappointed.  With that warning, I'm not saying I don't recommend this book, however, be forewarned, it's a bit slow and doesn't really have a totally satisfying ending.	2005-01-01

Nothing over the top except the characters which are done that way on purpose for comic relief, not to make up for mediocre writing.<br /><br />Good writing should contain some humor, but humor based writing is often so stupid and dull as to not be worth reading, this writing is both funny and serious and is wrapped up in a decent engaging story, so, that said, I recommend this to any that enjoy well written fiction.  It's only my second by Hiaasen (the other one I read was Sick Puppy, also a good read).<br /><br />This isn't earth shattering life changing fiction here, it's just very good writing, and that in itself, is reason to pick it up.	2004-12-31

I must give the author credit for several things, first she is a creative marketer and did a good job creating interest in her work, she is obviously resourceful and hard working.  I'm not sure, however, if this work, at least in its present state, would have  made the market without the use of grant monies.  There are several areas to criticize and amongst the rave reviews of four and five stars one can find the same complaints couched in with praise from people that received free review copies and felt more compelled to be generous than critical.<br /><br />First off; one can pick up any number of magazines, mini disposable books if you will, and find art work and photography that is more compelling and fine than what can be found here.  Simply put, the computer generated artwork and cheap printing methods employed do not give beautiful results, they do however, allow amateur designers the ability to produce work,  and thus the work does at least prove one of the authors points, that being that almost anybody can go out and publish a book these days, because, as she points out herself, it's so cheap to do.<br /><br />Second; no matter how compelling an argument or theory is and no matter how wonderful the design and artwork and photography may be, no matter how many different colors and fonts one uses, copy must be good, in fact excellent, if one wants to be widely read.  There is far too much competition, far too many good writers out there to settle for less than excellent writing, and here the work falls short.  I must admit that I didn't finish reading the entire book, and if that seems unfair at first, perhaps the fact that other reviewers complain that the author repeats herself and pats her self on the back too often will at least back up my belief that there wasn't a compelling reason to finish, the gist of her point is made in the first couple of chapters.<br /><br />Third; when it comes to reading fiction, I'm theorizing I'm not alone on this, people don't actually \\"read\\" the text, say in the way that one would read \\"see spot run\\" as a beginning reader.  I read fiction by \\"absorption\\" if you will, sometimes taking in several words or even whole sentences at a time.  I make mental pictures sometimes, but the wonderful mystery of great writing, at least when it comes to fictional novels, is the the \\"writing\\" disappears, it's simply not there.  I know I'm reading less than stellar writing when the words get in the way and the text becomes obtrusive.  The idea of making fiction better by adding changing colors, fonts and the like sounds not only like a bad idea it sounds like an idea that would ruin the work.<br /><br />Fourth; most of the ideas she espouses, different fonts, colors and vibrant artwork are already being used where they are productive and useful, pick up any successful catalog or magazine and you'll see my point.  There isn't anything new that the author espouses, she doesn't bring any original idea to the table, she only brings up the suggestion that books need to start to resembling advertising, because, she believes that will make them more compelling.  She talks about how her school children get more work done and get more involved when she uses color and font changes to enhance their assignments. Unfortunately the end result of what she wants to accomplish has already happened, it's called television.  Why have kids read at all, they can simply watch Romeo and Juliet in the form of moving artwork, filled with vibrant color and even sound, the one element the author doesn't insist on adding to books.<br /><br />As my last point I'd merely like to state that when someone comes up with a product that's an \\"idea\\" instead of a product that's a production of that idea, they have missed the boat.  I don't want to assume that a Brooklyn school teacher using grant money to produce a book is necessarily a liberal, however, it is a liberal idea and belief that the market place isn't all that's necessary to bring to bear a great idea.  If the authors idea has any merit, we simply don't need a book to tell us that it has merit, the consumer will demand that the market place meet the need and the book publishers will meet that demand.  Is a great idea that nobody wants really that great of an idea?  Or is it perhaps that where this idea is a great idea, it's already being employed (i.e. Advertising)?<br /><br />I do not harbor any ill feelings towards the author, however, being provided an advanced free copy doesn't compel me to the same type of uncritical praise I've noticed in some of the other reviews.  In the authors advertising literature she proclaims that first editions often grow in value, some ceo's and presidents are scooping up dozens of copies she contents, so buy a few extra, pass them out to friends.  Well, I'm sending my copy along to a friend that's a visual contractor, he designs brochures, pamphlets and the like.  He's been using the techniques espoused in this work for years and he found the idea of taking these techniques into books a compelling idea.  Perhaps he'll disagree with my assessment, perhaps, but in any case anyone buying this book that thinks it's a \\"good investment\\", well, I have this bridge, in Brooklyn, mind you, that I'd like to sell...sary to bring to bear a great idea.

Terrorism is real and sometimes it takes reading a fictional story, where we can identify and empathize with the characters, to really have the impact of important truths hit home.<br /><br />This story is hard hitting and important.  It's also a great spy thriller and done in a way that uses very little violent action, DeMille is a master at dialogue and getting the characters viewpoint across unobtrusively, he does what weak writers can't accomplish, he creates a block buster novel without having to recreate Hannibal Lector every time he sits down to write.<br /><br />Without going into detail found in the editorial reviews, this novel is about government screw ups, possible government cover ups and the reality that there are people out there in the world that want to kill nearly every America, certainly those of us that are Christians or Jews.  These killers are Islamic radicals and they want us dead.  Except for liberals and moronic government employees (which are often one and the same) people want to stop these killers and this book gives a great insight a fictional character that cares more about justice and truth than his own comfort and personal safety.  Hopefully someone that reads this book will be inspired to take a heroic stance.	2004-12-27
US	51062124	RBZNAG8XR5WIU	0375725601	517121775	The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Not a fictional novel, but a great slice of Americana	I wouldn't necessarily say that this historical account of two concurrent events cira 1890 reads like a novel, however, it's close enough that if you enjoy murder mystery fiction, this would probably be an enjoyable read for you.  It is really a great way to read history, in my opinion, because although there are lots of raw facts and a general time line of events, it doesn't get bogged down in boring detail.<br /><br />The downside of this type of writing is that there isn't a hero per se, we the reader aren't following along a detective or such, feeling his anxiety  wondering if he'll catch the killer before he strikes again or get in worse trouble.  The protagonist, if this had been fiction, would have been the lead architect and designer of the Chicago World's Fair, and while we get an intimate look into his personal life via letters and the like, all historical, we don't ever get a real \\"feeling\\" of his emotions because the author pretty much sticks to what he knows to be actual facts regarding his story telling.<br /><br />The antagonist of the story, a true psychopathic murderer, is given a very good treatment by the author, he reveals much of the evil by uncovering evidence given at trial plus news accounts and the like.  However, as with the other characters in the work, we only know things that are known to history, which of course is required in a history book, yet leave the reader used to good fiction a bit of an empty feeling.<br /><br />All in all I think this type of work, perhaps made most famous recently by the journalistic account told in the book A Perfect Storm, is going to take on a bigger slice of the publishing pie in the future.  It's a wonderful way to learn history, you get the facts but are also told a compelling story,  a million times more entertaining than a text book and in the end, you probably retain more to boot.<br /><br />I give this a strong recommendation to those interested in America history, architecture, invention and serial killers.tion and serial killers.	2004-12-24
US	51062124	R2JQWK2P0TPTQP	1400054184	925221592	How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter	Books	5	12	32	N	N	It's reprinted stuff, but still gold	I would posit that liberals get so mad and feel so much hatred towards Coulter because she's so good at nailing the obvious yet denied truths that liberals regularly shun to maintain their quite religious belief system.  Liberalism is a dying religion, to be sure, yet those adherents hanging on to the end, those that still adore the Michael Moore crowd, these are the ones that wouldn't care that Coulter speaks truth, truth and logic sit second to feelings, emotion and good intentions.<br /><br />This book, to my disappointment, is mostly reprints of Coulters' columns over the last few years, yes, there is some additional material here, some foot notes, or is it end notes?, or what?  Better get it right or some fanatic liberal like Frankin will not bother trying to dispute the enormity of the evidence pointing to raw and unadulterated evil on the part of professional liberals (the \\"victa-crats\\" to coin Larry Elder) he'll instead blather on, and even publish a book pointing out minor errors and grammatical mistakes.  Oh well, it ain't easy being wrong all the time, now is it?<br /><br />Coulter goes over some of the \\"mistakes\\" and \\"errors\\" liberals have accused her of, and she does admit to a couple actual errors, however, the vast majority of her work, and all the important stuff is spot on.  True.  Hard hitting.  Reality.  The liberal cause is a destructive force and those that follow its leaders do so generally out of misinformation or errant belief that the cause will better them regardless of how it might harm others.  Coulters' columns reprinted here go over all kinds of items that made the news over the last few years and rereading them is interesting, however, if you haven't followed her weekly offerings this book will allow you to get caught up.<br /><br />If you're new to Coulter and you want a straight forward, easy to read, and often hilarious look at liberals this is it.  If you're a liberal, and you can stomach the truth, read the book and put aside your petty emotions and use something called logic, it'll be enlightening to say the least, and perhaps, with an open mind, some light will be shed upon reason that Democrats have been losing so many elections.e your petty emotions and use something called logic, it'll be enlightening to say the least, and perhaps, with an open mind, some light will be shed upon reason that Democrats have been losing so many elections.	2004-12-24

Somehow I missed the third book in the series, I don't know, I was just getting into them because they were on the family book shelf, so what do I know?<br /><br />I gave this one less than three stars because I think it fell short of the first two, which I read and reviewed with ratings of three.<br /><br />Patterson has some annoying habits, and while the books are fast paced and quick to read, this one included, he has such huge plot holes it's hard sometimes to keep reading with a straight face.  I am saying the books are entertaining, but I'm not beating down the door to find the third book in the series, which I jumped over.  That should say something I think.<br /><br />You shouldn't read this one first, by any means, if you like the first three, than you'll probably want to go ahead and read this one too, however, it's much more sloppy than books one and two.<br /><br />The killers in this book aren't developed well at all, one is from previous works, he makes a comeback, as the editorial reviews point out.  There is a new killer and also a minor villain that makes an appearance.  The problem is that it's not a very long book, so as you can imagine, nobody, not even the hero and his new love, get a full treatment.<br /><br />The plot is again filled with stuff that could simply never happen.  Now I know, that's part of the magic of fiction, however, if the fiction is set in a real universe that we know and understand, it should at least follow basic logic and generally follow standard practices as we know them.  I'll give you a quick example, which actually involves an earlier book and a similar complaint I made in that review.<br /><br />There is a point in this book where the FBI is staking out the a bunch of places because  they are on the track of a horrible killer, they are even staking out a grave site of someone the killer once loved.  Okay, now, in Kiss the Girls, a victim, living and breathing, goes home from the hospital to her home in which just a short time earlier she was abducted.  The horrible killer is still loose and she's the only one alive that has seen him as the killer/rapist.  Now, do you think the FBI would stake out her house, noooooo...<br /><br />Anyway, maybe in Patterson's world the FBI got smarter between books two and four, but for me, it's just one of many huge plot holes that have nudged me into the opinion that Patterson is more excited about churning out books quickly then telling great stories.  But that's just one man's opinion.which just a short time earlier she was abducted.  The horrible killer is still loose and she's the only one alive that has seen him as the killer/rapist.

However, as popular as Patterson may be, he still writes in such a mediocre way which is overcome by the fact that he nails down interesting stories and keeps the action going.<br /><br />This book, like the first Alex Cross offering, is over the top in concept, much of the stuff here could never happen (or at least should never happen assuming the cops and FBI aren't filled with totally incompetent people).  One of the things that Patterson keeps doing, here and in other works, is that he creates false tension and suspense by having the characters do stuff that is so unbelievably stupid, it's hard not to let it ruin the story.  Think for a moment, you're a woman that's just survived a brutal kidnapping and rape from your home, by an intelligent and resourceful killer, who knows where you live.  Now, after leaving the hospital you insist on going home and staying there, unprotected.  That and the FBI and local police, who know the killer would like to see you dead (after all they did guard you at the hospital-you're a potential witness) don't bother to stake out your home, leaving you at the mercy of the killer.  Yeah, okay, that's believable, I guess, if you're fourteen or something.<br /><br />One other huge impossibility, and this happens in the prologue, so this is hardly a spoiler or anything, the young killer, future antagonist in our story is hiding in a house watching them, waiting to kill.  He's hiding, get this, in the ducting system.  Apparently Patterson has watched too many stupid heist movies, because, if you'll glance up from the computer as you read this, and look at the air register in the room you're in, you'll notice that it would be physically impossible for a six foot tall man to climb out of it and murder you.  In fact, it would be impossible for a child to crawl out of it.  I realize that in the movies, the bad guys are always crawling around in ducts, but, those are usually in commercial buildings, like banks or something, and, the bad guy isn't seen removing a grill from inside the duct and climbing out into a bedroom.  A bedroom never has a duct with a two foot wide diameter opening, no bedroom would ever need that much air, it isn't just silly, it's beyond belief.<br /><br />The problem with these little factual problems is that they destroy the credability of the rest of the story.  We the readers have to assume that the information about stuff we know nothing about is accurate, but how can we when there are such major errors in stuff we do know something about?<br /><br />In any case, the fast paced action and general readability of the work make it an above average thriller, so for those that like this kind of stuff, I still recommend it.guys are always crawling around in ducts, but, those are usually in commercial buildings, like banks or something, and, the bad guy isn't seen removing a grill from inside the duct and climbing out into a bedroom.

I wasn't too disappointed, in fact, since I expected it to stink, I was actually a bit impressed.<br /><br />If you're into chick written mystery thrillers, then this one will probably appeal to you.  I tend to enjoy more meaty offerings, Caleb Carr's great historical murder thrillers come to mind and Scott Turow's mysteries (lawyer based).  These types of books really get into the characters and don't rely so much on the \\"hyper\\" plot with out of the world, head line grabbing stories.<br /><br />This book makes the same mistakes that I found in the decent thriller Absolute Power, in which stuff happens that really could never happen.  I understand that is one of the points of certain types of fiction \\"Blockbuster\\" fiction, if you will, but it doesn't have to be so over the top.<br /><br />In any case, this one's a fairly quick read, and not a total let down, as for those that give this book the kind of glowing \\"best novel ever\\" type reviews, well, I don't believe those people have read much fiction.<br /><br />The cover of the paperback copy I read of this title had a glowing endorsement by Nelson DeMille, who is a superb writer, I'd recommend all his books before going to this series, but if you're a quick reader with lots of time, I'm going to give this an okay recommendation.	2004-12-07

Of course, unless a woman ghost wrote this book, it was written by a man, but the problems it has, in my opinion, are some of the same types I have found in reading novels by women.<br /><br />Too much telling instead of showing, too much detail about stuff I didn't care about, characters too much to type, not enough powerfully written action, too much touchy-feelie type interaction written in a way that just misses the mark and maybe the worst problem, a protagonist that could have been so much more and failed to be really engaging (she lacked the ability to get me to empathize with her, feel her emotions or really root for her).  Perhaps it is a very difficult task for a man to write a novel with a woman in the lead, and while I think maybe if Follet had been able to write this in the first person (at least the parts of the story from her pov) it might have made it a stronger story.<br /><br />In any case, it is a decent action novel set in occupied France just before the invasion, so any that enjoy fiction set in that period will probably enjoy the book.	2004-12-04

I think one of the problems was the lack of a clear protagonist through out the book, there are numerous people to root for, yes, but we are never given one main hero, one person whose thoughts and actions are the impetus for the story, there are in fact, multiple stories running throughout, parallel and intertwined, but separate.<br /><br />For those that are critical of the predictability of the story, I don't agree that it was a problem in any way, the good guys had to win out in the end, they suffer plenty through out,  the whole story would have been worthless if Follet had tried to get in some clever tragic ending here, he did the right thing by providing a bit of poetic justice and bringing the story to a proper ending.<br /><br />For those that enjoy historic fiction, I give a hearty recommendation to this work (the period being the twelve century) Follet did some research into the building of churches and cathedrals of the era and much of it was quite interesting (although I admit I got lost a bit with all the architectural terms).  There is plenty of violence, rape and  murder, kings and knights vying for power, earls and bishops,  sex and love, etc., to keep the story action filled and interesting from cover to cover.	2004-12-04
US	51062124	R1GWXB2QUABYCS	0451204158	562316613	Black Sunday	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Enjoyable terrorist thriller	Having seen the film a long time ago, and of course, reading some of Harris' other works, I finally got around to reading this one.  It's his first book, so it's not as polished (or as long) as a really first rate thriller usually is, however, it was a quick and enjoyable read and I'd highly recommend it to any that enjoy the genre of thriller/spy/terrorist nature.<br /><br />Post 9/11 brings an era where this type of book is no longer highly speculative fiction, but rather a story that could turn into a horrible reality all too easily.  I hope that our public officials that are in charge of our security have read this book (and all like it).	2004-11-28

When a book is described as being a guide to make something easy or understandable and then turns out to be a sales pitch it uncovers a basic truth, you can't trust the author.<br /><br />There is a web site (OANDA) that will allow you to open a practice FX trading account for free that will stay open indefinitely, the site has plenty of information on how FX trading works, how margins work and how the various indicators for technical trading work (on the trading platform you can use many different types of analysis for free).  There is also a board to post questions, etc., with other traders or those interested in trading, in other words, you can learn most of the information presented here for free from more unbiased sources.<br /><br />I bring all this up because there is no reason to buy this book unless you want a sales pitch, which in general, I have no problem with IF it's being given by someone that lets me know upfront that that is what I'm getting AND they are buying me lunch.  When I have to PAY to get sold, I'm twice the loser.<br /><br />Not all information is this book is bad, however, if you want a book that explains technical analysis, go buy one, why buy a book on making FX \\"easy\\" filled with chapters with basic explanations of candle stick charts (and tons of filler charts) and the like?  No reason I can think of, my only guess is that the author figured that anyone that read this that wasn't informed or well read on the topic would be impressed, go to his web site and buy his product.  In other words, what is disguised as a \\"how-to\\" guide is really a \\"how-to-make-the-author-money\\"  guide.  You'd think if the guy's ability in the market was so good he wouldn't need to resort to this low level (bottom feeding) type selling.<br /><br />One of the reasons presented to buy this book (on the inside flap and in the beginning chapters)  is to learn how to diversify your portfolio, which of course is generally seen as a good thing, so an appeal to the average investor is made.  The problem with this is simply that the average investor probably isn't paying nearly enough attention to their current assets and then they are asked to buy into this FX system, which, at a minimum would require many hours of work and research.  The dilemma is obvious, unless one is planning on becoming a day trader, you can't work a normal job and spent hours in study in all the various markets, there isn't enough time.  Ironically, after telling investors to be diversified, the author explains that to really be able to trade FX you should really only work in a couple pairs or so, because, after all, there is simply too much information to follow multiple markets.<br /><br />So there it is in a nutshell, the author wants you to be diversified BUT he tries to sell you his system to become an expert in a very narrow and specialized field.  Good luck.the average investor is made.

The book's sub title is \\"The art and science of good decisions\\" and that description is a good one to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to pick up this book, as it's not really a \\"how-to\\" book on decision making (like explaining how to make up a pro and cons list or that sort of thing) but a book that does what the sub title says.<br /><br />Besides the discussion on dating and marriage, mentioned in many reviews about this book, this book discusses voting, gambling, sports, public decisions, juries, games, probability and even a chapter on apportionment (how the various states get the number of representatives they do).  I found all topics very interesting and informative, and I think I'd recommend this book to anyone that's interested in the subject in a format that's a little less structured and loose than a text book, which was good 'cause it didn't get boring, but scholarly enough to make valid points and strong arguments.<br /><br />As for complaints, first the type face was annoying and distracting and while that didn't hurt the information, obviously, it did make reading it a bit more work than it should have been.  Second, the author felt the need to bash creationists for some reason, I fully realize that evolution is the proscribed religion of the PhD crowd, but hey, I'm a creationist and also a consumer, no need to bash me in a book that had nothing to do with evolution (other than than a brief mention of it, \\"blind\\" decision making in action, ok, but just because I'm a creationist doesn't make me a moron).<br /><br />Now, since I do a lot of political books, and perhaps someone into politics is reading this, I'd like to point out the discussions in this book relating to voting, public decisions, and juries make this book well worth the time and effort.  Excellent points were made and excellent questions posed.  The author mentions that he believes that at least some basic criteria should be met in order to vote, and I agree, he mentions he's been called horrible names for this feeling and I'm sure some reading this will find me offensive for agreeing.<br /><br />That's all fine, but riddle me this:  Since the left believes the \\"red\\" state people are so dumb and lack common sense and can't think, why do you suppose it would be that very same crowd that would most decry any sort of  intelligence or illiteracy test imposed upon voters?

Because one of the categories of fiction I enjoy is the mystery/thriller I thought that because this book was set in an historically based alternate reality and it was a mystery thriller I might really love it.<br /><br />I did enjoy the read and it is an entertaining book, however, it's written by a journalist and it's his first novel, so, because I'm so used to superior fiction, I found it a bit flat.  However, I'm not saying it's bad or that I didn't stay up late to finish it, because it is a good read and I did learn some stuff, and I did stay up late to finish it off.<br /><br />I'll say the ending sort of disappointed me, I ended up feeling like I'd been taking down a long path to view a sight and then wasn't allowed to look.

First off, before you libs start hitting the \\"not helpful\\" button, I gave Al Frankin's book a five star rating and I liked Carvelle's book too, so my rating here isn't just because I don't agree with the information.  I take into consideration both the writing style and the value of the information in my review.  I couldn't finish this (or didn't want to) and that says something and even though I'm a conservative and disagree with most of the left's agenda, I still give good ratings to books I enjoyed reading (even if I disagreed with most of what they espoused).<br /><br />Colmes writing style is a bit patronizing and some of his arguments are just plain silly.  He inserts in this book some emails from viewers of his television show to show how mean and hateful some people on the right are.  So what, I think, doesn't Alan realize that conservatives receive tons of hate email too?  What's that prove?<br /><br />His next annoying assertion is that if you look at the definitions of the words \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" in the dictionary, you'll realize that it's better to be a liberal.  What?  Does Mr. Colmes actually believe there are junior high school kids out there reading this?<br /><br />Next he tells us that the really bad side of the left of the political spectrum is communism, BUT MUCH WORSE the really bad side of the right side of the political spectrum is totalitarianism.  Huh?  Alan, really, don't you realize that communism can only survive in totalitarianism?  Maybe he should read some Ayn Rand.<br /><br />Okay, so Mr. Colmes wants us to believe that liberals are more \\"right\\" than conservatives because the dictionary definition of liberal sounds much cooler and hipper and that communism isn't as bad as totalitarianism, and besides, some conservatives out there sent him nasty emails.<br /><br />Yes, this is good reading, IF you're Alan's mother.<br /><br />I can't report on the second half or so of the book, but I flipped through it and basically Colmes believes Ann Coulter is nice but is totally on the wrong side of politics and that Saddam should still be in power because we were bad to take him out.  Bad USA, bad.  Okay,  I get the point, but unless there's some original thought in it, a good book it doesn't make.<br /><br />On a final note I'd like to point out that Mr. Colmes states that he doesn't understand why the big bad old USA should either a) have nukes or b) have a say in who else has them.  Then he wonders why conservatives call liberals unpatriotic.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book, if you're a liberal and you want to be part of the choir getting preached to with the same rehashed message, go for it, but I can't see the value in reading this as a conservative, it's nothing but the same ole same ole and not entertaining enough to bother with.ically Colmes believes Ann Coulter is nice but is totally on the wrong side of politics and that Saddam should still be in power because we were bad to take him out.

Edit late 2012:  I've become an atheist and renounced Christianity, that said, I still consider John a good writer and I certainly would still recommend him to someone interested in trying to be a better Christian.  I find the inter-denominational bickering from a different light now, from the outside, and find it amusing that Christians of different strips spend so much time and energy fighting about trivial nonsense while a dying world goes to hell (at least in their belief system).  John believes in strong community type groups, and the model he lays out sounds real good, but in 37 years of being a church attending, group attending Christian, I've never actually been part of something like he describes in terms of real actual community where each persons actual life becomes as important as your own.  Anyway, a worthy goal I suppose.<br />End edit.<br /><br />Yes there are those that had perfect fathers that never wounded them and they indeed have no use for this book.<br /><br />Sure.<br /><br />Yes there are those that want to go through a book and try and find ways to take every point to an absurd narrow point and then criticize it for not being \\"biblical\\".<br /><br />I paraphrase C.S. Lewis: Those of you that think Jesus literally wanted to become a mother hen have no business reading books for grown ups.<br /><br />For the rest of us, those that did receive father wounds (and understand the Bible and have a relationship with Christ) then this book is a good read and will undoubtedly stir something up inside your heart.  I'd recommend it to women too because although it's written to men there is good information here on understanding the opposite gender.<br /><br />There are plenty of ways to read parts of this book and complain that it's not scriptural or that it's not Christian or that the author is advancing some form of heretical teaching.  I'd say that only those that are completely narrow minded and can't view things outside the tunnel would have a problem with this book.  I don't think for a moment that the author was trying to invent \\"new\\" teachings and even if he's wrong on some of his points or interpretations, if any error is proof that a book is ungodly we might as well throw  out every single non biblical work including those by acknowledged masters and well, everyone that didn't contribute to the actual canon of scripture.<br /><br />Many of his stories are anecdotal, but they hit home.  I don't need  biblical exegesis and the actual Hebrew or Greek text to verify some things about life, I live on this planet, I interact with other people, I have life experience that validates much of what the author talks about and I find connections with those experiences in scripture, true, but I also know that ice cream tastes good and liver tastes horrible in spite of the fact that Jesus never taught me about these things.<br /><br />He recommends to his young son to stand up to a bully and hit back.  Now the legalists are going to quote \\"turn the other cheek\\" or other scriptural sources to \\"prove\\" that the author is \\"wrong\\".  However they are simply misusing scripture to be \\"right\\".  If the author had said that hitting back is always the right thing to do, I'd say he was being irresponsible, but in the context of his anecdote, in light of the whole story, he was probably giving the best advice he could to his son.  I've given my son the same advice in the past, there are some times that a boy must defend himself as there are also other times that he must \\"turn the other cheek\\".<br /><br />He talks about the beauty of women, the incredible mystery of their sexuality and how powerful it is.  This has been viewed by some as being sexist or superficial but I think they are missing the point and trying to deny certain truths that are self evident.  First off, he doesn't conclude that a woman has to look like a cover model to have value, but he implies that a woman needs to feel like her man is drawn to her as if she was acover model.  She needs  to feel desired and attractive and worth fighting for.  What's so controversial about that?  I'm not to sure myself, but regardless of whether or not one can \\"support\\" this in scripture, it seems self evident in the world I live in.  I tell my three year old almost everyday that she's a princess, that she's  beautiful and that I love her dearly.  I tell anyone that will listen that I'd take on an entire army to protect her.<br /><br />If her husband doesn't feel the same, he's not the man I want her to marry, period, I don't care what kind of proof texts the legalists can come up with to \\"prove\\" me \\"wrong\\".  If my daughters future husband isn't the kind of man that will slay any dragon, any time, he better watch is back 'cause I'm coming for him.<br /><br />And while I'm on that topic, you know what I've told  my son  a million times?  Protect your sisters, with your life, period.  When he has a wife and kids, I expect him to do for them what I always told him to do for his siblings, protect and defend.  Kill dragons.  Lay down your life if necessary.  The author of this book understands this God given and God created part of man that is capable of violence and then points out what it was created for.<br /><br />There is some criticism about how the author treats Satan in this work, I took what he had to say in the way that I think he meant it and how I saw it lining up with scripture.  I think the idea that the author was trying to say that the \\"the devil made me do it\\" is an excuse for sin is unfounded.  He was making the point that we have a real enemy that fights a real battle and that we are in a real war.  Last time I checked, this is a biblical teaching.<br /><br />I'm giving this work a five star rating because of the importance of the message, the ease in which it is read and because of the fact that it moved me and got me thinking.  If I were to incorporate all my usual guidelines into my rating I might drop it down to a four or four and a half, but I think it's one of those books that can really hit home so I'm giving it a five star rating.<br /><br />Of course, if you're a supreme legalist and were never wounded by dear old dad, then by all means, pass on this book.cover model.

US	51062124	RLCCB7VJL74DV	1400048753	386400734	The Republican Noise Machine: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy	Books	2	9	70	N	N	The pot calls kettle black with a straight face	It isn't too often I write a review for a book I just couldn't finish, but in this case, I felt I had read enough of it to give a valid opinion.  I've noticed that no matter how well written or lucid my reviews are for a political book the \\"other\\" side calls it \\"unhelpful\\" simply because they disagree with my viewpoint.  Such is the nature of the beast, but I bring it up because that same phenomenon  happens to a degree here in this book by its author who seems to believe that anyone on the right (in media) is automatically a liar and his or her audience is made up of fools.<br /><br />While I didn't read much beyond a third of it, I did flip through the rest of the book and here is an interesting quote from page 317: \\"And should it ever come, the end of news- the end of true facts and good information absent spin- would mean the end of democracy.\\"<br /><br /> Brock has become a mouth piece for the left in this book and  there on his changed perch he condemns the right for doing the exact thing he is doing as he condemns them.  The pot calling the kettle black to the nth degree.<br /><br />Perhaps Brock has made a valuable contribution to society with this book, however, because of that quote, remember the words \\"true facts and good information\\" which are important in Brocks world (and I agree) to having a good democracy.  Consider the current state of affairs in the news business these days:  Dan Rather can use forged documents and the left will say \\"well the information is true anyway, so it doesn't matter that the \\"facts\\" were presented in the form of a lie, they are still true.\\"  That's news over on the liberal news media yet Brock condemns Fox News throughout this book and uses analogies like comparing Rather to O'Reily.<br /><br />The comparison between a supposed \\"neutral and unbiased\\" reporter/journalist and a pundit that makes no effort at trying to hide a \\"neutral and unbiased\\" veil is complete hypocrisy on the part of Brock (and I've heard similar arguments from many on the left).  Brock basically states in this book that if you're against abortion, against gun control, want vouchers, want a smaller government, want less taxes, then, because of these beliefs it's impossible for you to be unbiased and neutral and everything you say and report is tilted towards your world view and is basically, in his opinion, destroying democracy.<br /><br />If Brocks opinion is valid, and I have to question the logic behind it, I wonder what it means if a reporter is for abortion, for gun control, hates vouchers, wants more government regulation and higher taxes (at least on the \\"rich\\").  I wonder.  Doesn't that mean that reporter can't possibly be unbiased and neutral?  You might think so, but alas, Brock has covered this point too.<br /><br />In Brocks world, if you are a liberal you can be  fair, honest, unjudgmental, you can have high journalistic standards, you can present the news as a true journalist (one with ethics) and yes, your stool doesn't smell bad.  Hallelujah!<br /><br />However, if you are a conservative (or a Libertarian, Brock calls black libertarian radio personality and author Larry Elder \\"right wing\\" pg 108) then you can't possibly be fair, honest and you are judgmental and couldn't possibly have any respect for journalistic values.<br /><br />On a final note, Brock shows complete comtempt for the market place of ideas, in his world, the news would be restricted to fair minded places like the New York Times and NPR.  When the NYT puts the story of Sandy Bergers theft of classified documents on page A17, that's because they are using fair and unbiased journalism as their guide.  If Rush mentions the incident, he isn't giving real news and then commentary on that news, he's a right wing attack dog spinning facts and telling lies and duping an audience of mind numbed robots that can't think for themselves.  Which reminds me, the other night, on a \\"fair minded and unbiased\\" NPR show, Bill Press (highly partisan liberal) noted how the audience of Rush \\"never reads a newspaper\\".<br /><br />This is the kind of \\"news\\" that Brock wants America to have: NPR,  NYT, and Dan Rather.  Brock wants the highly popular shows (television and radio) and the best selling books and conservative papers and magazines to be shut down because they are destroying democracy.  How \\"democratic\\" of him.(highly partisan liberal) noted how the audience of Rush \\"never reads a newspaper\\".    <br /> <br />This is the kind of \\"news\\" that Brock wants America to have: NPR,  NYT, and Dan Rather.

Books	4	5	6	N	N	Important insights on difficult topic	Edit late 2012:  I've become an atheist and renounced Christianity, so ironically this book now applies to me as a target as opposed to a reader.  I've most definitely become an enemy of Christianity, especially the specific brand that Nathan leads in (or did the last time I was aware).  Being excommunicated (from the original Vineyard fellowship) and cast aside, then jailed for annoying one of their pastors I came to realize that all the talk of \\"turn the other cheek\\" and \\"bless your enemy\\" is just that, talk.  People I loved like family did the most vile and cruel things to me in the \\"name of Jesus\\", the good side is I now completely understand why so many people hate Christians, something I never understood before....<br />I leave my original review intact below, it's good work if you can get it, I don't disagree with Nathan's idea of being nice, I just don't see it happening, Christians are self righteous hypocrites, at least those that make it to leadership.<br />End edit.<br /><br />Because of some of my recent readings, books written from a liberal point of view, this book was timely and well received by me.  I think it's important to understand the thoughts, feelings and attitudes of those that have diametrically opposed viewpoints and world views from ourselves (regardless of which side of an issue we are on).<br /><br />As a conservative Christian I often find myself speaking or communicating to someone that has liberal and/or non-Christian world views.  Since Jesus accepted and loved those that were often on the outside of the religious authorities circle of acceptability, and since he calls me to do the same, I think it's important to understand the other side and to try and find places of commonality.  Rich Nathan does a good job of pointing out places where Christians can find commonality with those that are often considered way too far away from a Christian world view to be worth trying to communicate with, much less expecting to help facilitate a conversion experience with.<br /><br />I think Nathan could have been more focused in a few places, he spent some time in some of the chapters pointing out why a certain viewpoint or belief was wrong from a Christian standpoint, which I felt was redundant for the obvious reason that he was preaching to the choir.<br /><br />I liked the places where he found common ground such as in the brief history of Susan B. Anthony, an early feminist that fought not just for suffrage but also against abortion.  I think Nathan did a good job of showing how many that are outside of Christianity may very well have attitudes and feelings that are moving them towards Christ.<br /><br />I think this book should be read by any in the Church that have mixed feelings or strong feelings against those groups of people that are ardently anti-Christian or simply just have world views and beliefs that put them at odds with the Christian faith.  Nathan does a real good job of showing, and giving real life examples of, ways that we in the Church can reach out and serve those that we seemingly have nothing in common with and perhaps even view as being hostile towards us.<br /><br />Rich Nathan doesn't bend over backwards trying to suppress his view that sin is ugly to God and hurts our relationship with Him.  Those reading this book will not feel justified in lifestyles or beliefs contrary to traditional Christian beliefs, and in fact, I'm quite sure that those in groups discussed here would be offended with a reading of this book, however, Nathan is true to his faith, with out which, this book would have been worse than meaningless.<br /><br />I give this book a strong recommendation to any that feel it would be helpful to them (I sort of felt I was \\"in the choir\\" so to speak).  My four star rating isn't due to the quality and purpose of Nathan's teaching here, just simply because of the high quality of work I'm comparing it too.  Again, I do recommend this to those that struggle at all with beingloving and kind to those they find themselves \\"at war\\" with.loving and kind to those they find themselves \\"at war\\" with.	2004-09-17
US	51062124	RSLDK20ALXNCR	0385484046	148448597	Hard Left	Books	2	6	14	N	N	Black racist celebrates OJ's release	Written some eight years ago, I wonder if Tavis Smiley still expects the \\"party of Lincoln to re-propose slavery\\" since he thought we might \\"any day now\\" back in 1996.  Goodness, I didn't realize what a horrible racist and evil person I was until I read this book but Smiley let me have it, with both barrels.<br /><br />Following the general \\"I'm a liberal, hear me roar\\" rhetoric which has only grown more virulent with the election (and probable re-election) of Bush, Smiley lets his readers know that angry white right wingers are only out done in their evil destructive ways by those gross and disgusting black conservatives, which, Smiley calls an \\"oxymoron\\".<br /><br />In other words, there really can't be anyone that's both black and a conservative, that would be an illogical construct, probably invented by evil whites, but he didn't actually say that, no, but he did write that they only got to where they are because white conservatives wanted to exploit them.  Poor Powell, Rice, Watts, Thomas, Sowell and others.<br /><br />Smily does have some good things to say.  He believes (or at least did in 1996) that we ought to shut down the borders to illegals, deport those that are here now illegally, stop allowing so many immigrants to come here just because of family connections (they should be admitted because they have good work skills he proposes) and finally he proposes sanctions against employers that employ illegals.<br /><br />Wow, for a minute I thought I was reading a conservative book.  Look, now I know why I haven't heard of this guy before today, he'd never make it in liberal politics today, gosh, even a conservative espousing those views on immigration couldn't get elected.  He also wrote that we ought to be able to cut down some old growth trees if it would help people and create jobs.  Yeah, that'll go over with well with his fellow liberals, putting people over trees, wait, he's a racist and wants to ruin the environment, maybe he's really a white conservative Christian in disguise.<br /><br />This reminds me of something I learned a good deal about in Tammy Bruce's book The New Thought Police.  The left has no room for opposing viewpoints.  And, ironically, Smiley, in this book, contends that one of the huge problems of the right is that the right doesn't allow dissension or drifts from the \\"party\\" line.  It was the GOP that had speakers at its convention that are publicly known for being pro-abortion.  Quickly, name the speaker at the Dems convention that is anti-abortion.  Perhaps Smileys' contention might have been more true 8 years ago, but today, he's 180 degrees backwards.<br /><br />I did get some enjoyment out of this quick read (about three hours or so) because it showed me the viewpoints of someone that had a proud  \\"African America Liberal\\" label.  I'm sure some of these viewpoints have evolved since the writing of this book, never the less, it was eye opening.<br /><br />He believes that a black marrying a white is a betrayal and that nothing could be more harmful to the black community.  Then he trashes Partrick Buchanans concerns about the diluting of the European blood in America.  I had to laugh.  As a white Christian conservative I'd like to think that I'd marry someone that was both a Christian and a conservative because those are my values, but that I'd not give a thought to skin color.  I guess that makes me a racist too.<br /><br />That reminds me of the other funny thing Smiley talked about.  He thinks we conservatives are, or would be, angry at Asians if racial preferences were dropped at places like the UC system here in California (because they as a group stand to gain the most ground).  God, that's a funny one.  All of my Asian friends from high school went on to college and better jobs than me.  God bless them.  I'm the first to admit they worked harder than me in school, were more dedicated to the idea of college and were more supported by their families (in regard to college).  I neveronce felt the \\"system\\" was against me, I made my own choices.  I once met a refugee from Iran, a sweet woman that barely escaped with her family, she told me that she was denied entrance to a UC school because Persians are classified as white.  It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad.<br /><br />I believe that Smiley makes a great case in his book, a great case for staying a strong conservative and fighting for conservative causes, that is.  I do recommend it a little bit, for those that are interested in the feelings of an angry African American liberal that was happy O.J. Simpson got away with killing a couple of whites, this book will fit the bill.lege).  I never once felt the \\"system\\" was against me, I made my own choices.

US	51062124	R19JSK4BXDCFK9	0310241820	64463183	Bible Jesus Read, The	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Good commentary	I'm a big fan of Yancey's writing style and clarity, and I really enjoyed this work.  That said, if you're new to this author, I'd suggest starting with either The Jesus I Never Knew, or What's so Amazing about Grace (or perhaps one of his books that deal with the issues of pain).<br /><br />If you're not new to Yancey, and are wondering what kind of book this is, here's my take:<br /><br />It's not really a scholary look at the Old Testament, like who wrote what, when and why.  It's more of an over view of why the Old Testament is still important to us today, and how it relates directly to our Christianity.<br /><br />Yancey tackles the questions of why life sometimes stinks and is seemingly unfair (an age old question asked in some of the oldest writings of men).<br /><br />Yancey writes about how Jesus answers the nagging thoughts about whether or not an individual matters to God, questions that where asked over and over in the Old Testament, not only by individuals, but by the early Hebrews through the glory period of the Jewish nation on to the time of Christ when it seemed that Israel would be perhaps be destroyed forever as a nation.<br /><br />If you are new to Christain books (or new to Christianity) I suggest reading the other Yancey books first, then if you feel, as I do, that he's a really wonderful writer, you'll naturally come back to this one.  I only gave this book less than five stars because I felt it was a bit too short, and just not quite as good as some of the others, not because I don't highly recommend it.	2004-09-13

The outline form and ideas for getting involved in this book, however, are all 4 and 5 star ideas so I do recommend this title, to conservatives and liberals alike, if they are looking for ways that they can get involved on a personal level in the political arena because each idea, although lightly covered here in a page or two, can and should spurn thinking and further investigation.<br /><br />I would like to point out, and take issue with, the fact that all the stories and all the viewpoints in this title are anti-conservative, and in some cases, extremely anti-Bush.  That's fine, I'm not complaining that people feel that way nor that they write about it, but what I am taking issue with is that the book should be more forthright on its cover and in its title.<br /><br />The title \\"50 Ways to Love Your Country\\" is fine, and conservatives can use every idea in this book (albeit for the opposite side of most of the arguments).  But the books title should have said something to the effect that all the 50 ways will be presented from people that think Bush is ruining American and if we reelect him we are converging into the fast lane to hell.<br /><br />I'm going to assume that the people that made this book realized that all these effective and useful tools for change, something that average people can do, would also be effective if used by the right, so obviously, although I doubt they'd say it out loud, those involved in this project probably don't want conservatives to read it.  I say, if you're a conservative that wants to get involved and have a say on a personal level in politics and how our country is run then reading this book would be helpful.<br /><br />Every time you read in the book something like \\"Bush will destroy the country and ruin the environment and blah, blah, blah\\" just mentally substitute \\"Kerry\\" for Bush and the ideas on how to get involved won't change, the advice won't change, just the side your fighting for will.<br /><br />Again, to reiterate, I am recommending this book, I think MoveOn has every right to a voice in American politics, I think they can spend all the money they want and say whatever they want.  I wish they'd grant the same feeling to my side, but of course, if liberals can't be hypocrites, what would they do?and blah, blah, blah\\" just mentally substitute \\"Kerry\\" for Bush and the ideas on how to get involved won't change, the advice won't change, just the side your fighting for will. <br /> <br />Again, to reiterate, I am recommending this book, I think MoveOn has every right to a voice in American politics, I think they can spend all the money they want and say whatever they want.

I have also been listening pretty regularly to Sean Hannity on the radio lately (with all the election excitement going on).  And I listen to Rush too.  I am a pretty strong conservative, although I stray off into the Libertarian camp on many issues.  That said, I really enjoyed this book and thought it was well researched (although I disagree with much of its conclusions) and well written.<br /><br />I've heard Hannity call Al Franken \\"stupid\\" so I was half expecting this book to read like some kind of nut case tirade by a guy that has stool for brains.  Now, I'm not saying I don't think that this book is mostly left wing propaganda, based upon false premises and destroying straw men, but I am saying that I don't think Al is stupid, he's quite brilliant in fact and often very funny.  He's also a good writer and I think my five star rating of this book is well deserved, even though I still believe he's a left wing wack job that has been so blinded by his desire to destroy the conservative movement that he's done the very same type of thing that he's accused his opponents of doing.<br /><br />Now, just to make myself clear, I'm not saying that people shouldn't read this book, in fact, Al Franken made me think, this book caused my brain to engage more forcefully, however, I must reiterate, he didn't cause me to move to the left at all, in fact, quite the opposite.<br /><br />An example:  Franken brings up Bushes comments about how he [Bush] didn't think that on a matter of principle anyone should pay more than a third of their income in taxes.  I totally agree with Franken when he questions this figure, where in the heck did it come from?  A third?  The ironic thing is that while I am in complete agreement that Bush pulled this number out of his a, um, hat, I totally disagree with Franken that the number could and perhaps should be higher.  I'm totally unhappy that Bush thinks a third is okay, gee, God only asks for ten percent.<br /><br />Of course, the liberals want to spend more, regulate more, and quash more freedoms, which is why I highly, highly recommend that all conservatives get their hands on this book and read it.  Study it.  Just to clarify, in case anyone was wondering,  I borrowed my copy from the library, heck, we don't have to support the enemy financially, now do we?<br /><br />My tongue in cheek comment there (\\"the enemy\\") was undoubtedly construed by liberals as being mean and hate filled.  Okay, but gee, Franken says he hates Coulter and Hannity and uses language about them that wouldn't be allow in this review, so I ask, is it okay if conservatives use humor too?  Or is that not okay?  Read the book \\"The New Thought Police\\" (Tammy Bruce).  I'm not sure how serious Franken is when he describes some of his feelings towards certain conservatives, but I do believe he really can't stand Bill O'Reilly personally.  On this issue, I stand with Franken, I thought Bill was a mean and rude individual before (he once told the mother of two kidnapped daughters that she was getting \\"too emotional\\" and cut her off the show, he had previously arranged a meeting with the girls (they had been taken to Saudi Arabia) and didn't bother to notify the mother until afterwards).  Franken makes a strong point that Bill is a bully and an egotist.  I tend to agree.<br /><br />Franken makes a point I happen to totally agree with, and that is that most of today's political debate on television is simply political porn.  I quit watching tv last year and hope and pray I never ever go back to that horrible mind numbing habit.  I'd sooner start smoking.  People want sounds bites and argument and most people aren't patient enough to seriously study an issue or read a serious book about it or at the very least, read political columns where at least an argument can be made with out the noise and interruption of the typical news show.  When Franken brings up this point, I decided I liked the guy, even though, I'm still conflicted, because, after all, I really do agree with Hannity and I think he's a nice guy and I absolutely adore Ann Coulter.<br /><br />Maybe I'm twisted.<br /><br />In any case, at least I read and think about the issues and I suggest more people do the same.  I was initially turned off by the demeanor of Al Franken, and while I still strongly disagree with him on the issues, I think he's worth hearing out and I do recommend his book.<br /><br />To some degree this book does exactly (in book form) what political news shows on television do that cause Franken to label them political \\"porn\\".  It highlights lots of exciting tidbits of information, it works on finding \\"gottcha\\" moments and tries to show how screwed up and mean the other side is.  Franken goes on and on how Bush is a horrible liar and that Rove is satan or something worse.  In many ways it's similar to how Coulter writes, except that, in her case, I think she does a better and more serious job of mining the truth.  Franken tends to swear more, and in general, act like a liberal.  In any case, my point is that these types of books are easier to read than ten volumes of scholarly discourse on a certain topic, so we read them instead.  That and they are far more entertaining.<br /><br />The key is figuring out who is telling the truth.  Franken labels this book a \\"fair and balanced\\" look at the right.  Fair enough but he also explains how he choose 14 students to help him research the book and all of them, himself obviously included, are pretty strong liberals.  I'm not saying that liberals can't be fair, but how is 14 to \\"zero\\" a \\"balanced\\" approach?<br /><br />To sum up my feelings and this review, I recommend this book, it's well written and entertaining.  I don't think Al Franken is a bad guy, I just think he's on the wrong side of the fence politically.  I also think he can teach us conservatives something, maybe, most importantly that although the Bush administration is far from the left on the war on terrorism (thank God), he's not much different from the liberals on much of his social agenda.<br /><br />Franken attacks Bush for not spending enough money on stuff, and I'm reading his book thinking, God help us, Franken wants to give away a dollar, Bush wants to  settle for ninety five cents and those of us that believe in less government are getting running over by freight trains while people like Franken are calling Bush heartless, cruel and mean.

She writes of her experiences working with,and knowing as a friend,  the radio personality Dr. Laura.  She then recounts how the radical left maligned her in words and print and  also threatened  physical harm in addition to making  bomb threats.<br /><br />Yes, the radical left, The Thought Police, are tolerant and peaceful and loving and kind unless you disagree with them, then they turn ugly and vicious and threaten to blow up things.<br /><br />Being one of the members of that \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" I know first hand how easy it is for people to accuse me of being a mean spirited dishonest person, all I have to do is give my opinion or express my feelings on any political or religious topic.  Of course, I'm not a public figure, so it doesn't affect me personally that much.  Bruce talks about how some public figures have been so maligned and slandered that they've been reduced to tears.  I realize, of course, that certain members of the left are probably elated to hear such stories, but readers of the book will see, if they take it all into context, how the once liberating idea of being able to express your beliefs without fear has evolved to a state in which members of the right need to protect themselves from physical violence by extreme left wingers, the \\"party of peace\\" (my sarcasm).<br /><br />Bruce talks about being cut off from certain engagements because of her views.  She talks about how the NOW organization actually tried to get her to shut up about O.J because they (the supposed feminists)  were concerned her distaste for the act of a man violently cutting up two people, one of them an ex wife of his who he had previously beaten on multiple occasions, was going to harm the relationship that NOW had with the black community.  I suppose it wasn't THAT bad, I mean, poor Simpson was an oppressed and victimized black man, down trodden due to the horrible racism he faced, so I mean, I guess she could have given him a pass, but, since she, unlike her soon to be ex-cohorts, actually has a ton of integrity, she just couldn't stop in her fight to support women that faced violent men in their lives (regardless of race I might add).  That fighting spirit and intellectual honesty lead to this great book which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Bruce introduced a lot of political stories I hadn't heard the details of before, the Brawley story involving Sharpton and others in the chapters on the \\"Misery Merchants\\" her description of the way that certain black activists elevated personal power over the actual helping of people.<br /><br />Her story of two murders was quiet enlightening.  It seems that not far from where Matthew Shepard was murdered, a young woman who didn't want to abort the pregnancy that resulted from an elicit affair with an adult man was brutally murdered by her former lover.  You probably never heard about that one on the national airwaves, it didn't fit into the agenda of the left to make a big deal out of it, but you sure heard about Matthew Shepard, didn't you?  I can't recall the name of the young murdered girl, but I'll never forget Matthew Shepard, it's been drilled into my memory by the constant retelling.  It isn't that his death wasn't horrible, it was, it's just that in the other murder, two people died, now didn't they?<br /><br />As Tammy Bruce points out in the book, the issue isn't that we have to agree with others that have dissenting voices nor that they should have to agree with us, it's that the radical left wants the dissenting opinion silenced.  Free speech and free expression in the public discourse surrounding politics, religion, and such should have their limits, I guess, in the minds of some (this isn't about shouting \\"fire\\" in a crowded theater, by the way, it's about hating a radio personality so much that you threaten to blow people up with bombs if they allow her to speak).  Bruce likes and has friendships with people that she doesn't agree with on many social/political/religious topics, she speaks out for their right to express their opinions.  She points to the hypocrisy she sees in many of the organizations and personalities on the left and of course, as expected, she's attacked by many of those that share her beliefs on social issues.  It's a strange world, that makes strange bed fellows, for sure, and this book is a must read for any that follow modern politics.<br /><br />It's well written and makes very strong points, Tammy Bruce has laid out a compelling argument as to why and how  the Thought Police operate and how their agenda hurts all those that love freedom and liberty.<br /><br />With the chance of sounding politically incorrect I might add that she's a total hottie too.ersonality so much that you threaten to blow people up with bombs if they allow her to speak).

This is obviously an older book, and as such it lacks a certain familiarity or \\"modernness\\", however, much of the message is timeless and relevant and certain predictions about the future almost give Schaeffer a \\"prophet\\" type air.<br /><br />The book was written in the 1970s and starts off with a chapter on the \\"roots of the student revolution\\".  Now that time and place is gone,  and despite the fact that currently (in 2004) the country is reliving some of the Vietnam era again because of the Presidential race, the sixties and seventies won't be coming back.  What will remain the same, however, is that there will always be the young and they will always question the previous generation and while the means that they use to rebel may change,  the inner drive to figure out life and question the status quo will not go away.  Nor should it, I believe.<br /><br />Schaeffer here calls upon the church to be real, to live a real community and to live in real truth.  Only then can it minister to the young and have a rightful place to answer honestly questions and challenges to faith.<br /><br />One of the strongest points he makes in this book is that the church often is on the same side of an argument as the \\"establishment elite\\" but it better make sure that people in general and the young in particular don't confuse being on the same side of an issue with actually being an ally of that system.<br /><br />The point is very relevant today.  We as the church must stand strong for scriptural truth and while that stand may on seem to ally us with a certain political party or movement, we cannot allow ourselves to be seen as allies to something that is of this world, even, and perhaps especially, when that system is in the right.  It doesn't mean we don't work together with world systems and political systems, it just means that we must maintain a separate identity and always stand strongly for real truth and real community and not back down from serving our real God.<br /><br />Schaeffer deals with science and philosophy and how those disciplines have had an effect  on modern man.  Some of conclusions about the future are downright amazing, he predicts a time in the future when all mankind is interconnected by computer and that the immediate \\"democracy\\" that will be available by having the ability to capture the beliefs of the majority world wide at any given time will help shape public policy (world wide).<br /><br />He points out that if democracy is the end all of law, then if the majority of Germans had voted supported Hilter, then who can morally oppose the holocaust.  Law must have some basis besides the rule of majority, he argues, and he explains some of the problems \\"modern\\" man has faced due to his reasoning that man was the end.<br /><br />He also discusses to some degree the ecology movement and pantheism.<br /><br />Many of the issues haven't changed, at their foundation, very much, and that's the reason I give this book a recommendation.  He really challenges the church to live up to her responsibility and for the individual to embrace revolutionary Christianity and to live for Christ.r /> <br />Schaeffer deals with science and philosophy and how those disciplines have had an effect  on modern man.

I'll even go so far as to say that I enjoyed reading Carville more than I did Hannity, however, I don't agree with nearly all of the positions of the former and do agree with most of the positions of the later so my rating is based on writing style and information not the policies espoused.  I believe that conservatives should read this book and I give it a high recommendation to those that are in positions that a more through knowledge of the other sides positions would be helpful.<br /><br />Now as to the specifics of the book and the things I liked and disliked.<br /><br />First, I liked the actual lay out of the book (something of an outline form that stayed consistent issue to issue).  And I felt I had a good grasp of  how Carville believes the country should be run and why he hates George Bush so much.  He actually made reference to lynching Bush, but said he couldn't go that far because \\"Mary would make me sleep on the couch.\\"<br /><br />Now I think it's important to understand why liberals hate conservatives like Bush so much because understanding that hatred, to some degree at least, will help those of us that are conservatives to better explain how our positions are superior and actually do a better job of securing those things that we all agree that we want, like strong national security, a strong economy and a clean environment.  Yes, conservatives, despite the rhetoric from the left, don't want their kids playing in acid rain or drinking toxic water either.  I think conservatives can read this book and actually gain strength in their knowledge that can be used to help defeat the left, which, in my opinion, is currently one of conservative Americas most important challenges.<br /><br />Secondly I'd like to point out the weaknesses I found here while trying not to get into the position of merely arguing my opinions on the issues, but rather, to point out how Carville has left out factual and important arguments regarding policy that, while perhaps weakening his arguments (and maybe perhaps even totally unfounded) would have made a stronger book.  I read this book to see what the other side says, and Carville gave me that, but what he didn't give readers on the left was what we conservatives actually believe, he mostly built straw men to knock down.<br /><br />Any disagreement on that last issue is fine, but if someone on the left wants to believe that I as a conservative believe something just because of one simple fact that Carville places in his book, and not the hundred of other facts that I also believe, hasn't really done himself much service, but, again, that's fine by me.<br /><br />The most glaring example of what I'm trying to explain here can be shown in how he deals with the issue of vouchers in the section on education.  Carville explains that there is this study that showed that vouchers worked, and tons of conservatives praised the study, etc.  Then the study was shown to have a major flaw, it didn't really prove that vouchers worked, so, vis a vi, conservatives are wrong and progressives are right.  The problem with this kind of logic is, or should be obvious, even without this study, there are hundreds of examples and dozens of very strong arguments in favor of vouchers.  Now, people may disagree to the validity of some or all of those arguments but that's not the point, Carville didn't include them in this book.  What he's done here is on the same level of someone saying that since the Yankees lost yesterday they have no chance of winning the series this year.<br /><br />When discussing tort reform, Carville quotes Bush decrying \\"frivolous\\" lawsuits then writes \\"Of course, by \\"frivolous lawsuit\\" he means \\"any lawsuit.\\"  He then goes on to give some examples of important lawsuits that stopped industry abuses and tries to equate the conservative position ontort reform as being the same as if we conservatives want little girls to have their guts sucked out by swimming pool pumps and babies burnt to death from faulty pajamas.  This kind of reasoning may be fun to those that like to think of Bush as an evil tyrant, however, as intelligent argument goes, I find it very lacking.  I recently read an article about the shortage of ob/gyn doctors because the high cost of insurance makes entering the field less inviting, if Carville wants believe that we conservatives want real malpractice to continue and real victims to be denied relief, that's fine, but his arguments to why he believes this was lacking in my reading of this book.  As a side note, he did include a policy position I'm in agreement with regarding doctors, that being that strikes against their records should be public so that the consumer has more knowledge.  On that same line of reasoning, Carvilles' strongest points in the book come when he gives into \\"market\\" logic and then writes \\"conservatives can get behind me on this one.\\"<br /><br />Carville has a chart on taxes that he suggests readers photo copy and pass out the next time they hear someone say taxes are too high in America.  Carville is arguing that taxes should be raised across the board because in his clever, but deceptive chart, it shows that America pays, as a percent of GNP, less in taxes than any of the other OECD countries (except for Mexico).  Like most of the arguments in this book, we are left to try and figure out all the other information that he leaves out and just trust him that because he says a chart is important, it is.  One of the issues he doesn't bring up is that Mexico has high tax rates, but because they have trouble collecting (due to the repressive rate structure), they amount of taxes they actually collect is low, thus placing them below us on his chart.  At the top of the chart, of course, are the extremely socialist countries, and if America in general were to support the progressive agenda, there we'd be as well, in short order.<br /><br />Besides vouchers, tort reform and taxes, Carville takes on a whole host of other issues like social security, national defense, the environment and others and my general feeling is that he handled them in similar fashion to the examples I've given above.  He gets across some color in the book, he hates Bush, still defends the Clinton sex scandal and really really hates Ken Starr.  Those asides actually made the book more entertaining.<br /><br />Whether or not one takes the progressive (liberal) side or the conservative side as their starting point, building straw men to knock down doesn't make a stronger argument, it would have been a better book, and more intellectually honest, to try and argue the true and more complete arguments that conservatives use for taking the positions they do.<br /><br />That said, I urge progressives and liberals to go out and read books written from the right, to see what arguments we actually do put forth in support of vouchers, lower taxes, less government and the like, and I urge conservatives to read this book, it was informative and instructive and I know it has helped make me a stronger conservative.e position on tort reform as being the same as if we conservatives want little girls to have their guts sucked out by swimming pool pumps and babies burnt to death from faulty pajamas.

I wondered why the rating for this book seemed so low, but after looking through just a few reviews, it became obvious, most of the low ratings were from people that haven't bothered to read the book and just want to vote that they hate Conservatives.<br /><br />There is no disputing the simple truth, and Hannity lays out many simple basic truths here, so the dispute often goes out into left field.  The left doesn't want to admit that their side gutted the intelligence community, tied the hands of patriots, and practically gave aid to Americas enemies, so they dismiss the plain and simple facts and start yelling \\"Bush did it for the oil.\\"  Well, even if he did what's their excuse for why Clinton didn't do it?  He was saving the oil for the bad guys?  Sean Hannity is more fun to listen to than to read, but he has the basics here and anybody out of the political loop ought to give him a chance and investigate a bit of what he says.<br /><br />Go back and read the papers or read the history books.  Tons of terrorism happened on Clintons watch.  Billions of dollars hasn't ended poverty.  Higher tax rates have hurt the economy and hurt the average American.  Modern science has shown even more conclusively that Clinton, Gore, Rev. Jackson and others were all correct when they believed life started at conception and abortion is wrong.  Oh, you didn't know that all these libs were once vocal pro-lifers?  Well, then, you do have something to learn, read the book.	2004-08-19

After reading several of his recent books, I finally got a chance to go back many years and read this one.<br /><br />I'll get my one main complaint out of the way, it's the fact that the book has a plethora  of characters and I wasn't ever really sure who I was rooting for specifically.  As it turns out, the protagonist if you will, is probably the group as a whole, they banded together and survived as a group (even though some of the characters were lost).  I guess I can accept that, although I prefer the strong male leads that dominate all the subsequent works by DeMille that I've read.<br /><br />Even though written nearly three decades ago, not much has changed in world politics and this novel could probably take place in reality tomorrow with only a few minor changes.  I often wonder if world security forces go through fiction, after all, Tom Clancy wrote about a pilot flying a jet plane into the White House and later when it was tried for real, everyone acted like \\"nobody could have ever imagined that\\".  In any case, this book and DeMille's The Lions Game, both have airplanes being terrorized in different and unique ways, I hope someone is taking notice.<br /><br />As for the why I give this book a strong recommendation, and why I'm sticking with five stars in spite of my complaint, it's a page turner, fast paced and well written, it has military science, love, war, hate and a whole lot more.	2004-08-19

I've read many of these types of books (trying to glean something from each) for it's very true that \\"an unexamined life is not worth living.\\"<br /><br />I am not sure who I'm quoting there, but it's so true.  I would give a hardy recommendation to any looking to make improvements in their life to pick up a copy of this book and do some self reflecting.  I know that there was much in here, especially for a book worm like myself, that won't be brand new advice, but there's always something to gain from reading well thought out words of wisdom.  Sometimes you just need to hear things put a certain way for them to ring a bell inside your head.<br /><br />I'd give this one a strong recommendation for using as a gift to the high school grad or the college student, I wish I'd had more of this kind of wisdom placed into my brain when I was younger, it might have made a big difference over time, often small changes, small habits, over time, can make or break certain dreams and visions.<br /><br />Hehn uses some Biblical wisdom, but never in a preachy way, and lots of sports analogies (which are universal enough even non-sports people will catch his meanings).  There are many little stories from his personal life and they made the book read more like someone was telling you a little bit about himself than someone was trying to \\"teach\\" something, which made a big difference in it's readability.<br /><br />Lastly, I came away with the impression that Larry Hehn is a genuine nice guy and his work here was intended to help others.	2004-08-19

DeMille is one of my favorite authors for a reason, he simply writes very well.  Action, romance, intrigue, murder, love, hate, it's all here, plus, he gets in, just subtly enough at times, how horrible a system of government totalitarianism/collectivism is.  Oh, and he makes a few jabs at our own system too,  but he sizes things relatively.<br /><br />Now why do I think all that's important?  Well, an action thriller/spy novel in the Ludlum/Clancy type is good enough, but I think DeMille is able to bring just a bit of humor and sarcasm to his characters that takes them a cut above par.  They live and breathe just a bit more and they love and hate just a bit more.  In their actions and words, they make a case for certain truths, and in this novel, they show us plainly how the end result of communism (or similar systems, but the USSR in particular here) is just how Ayn Rand showed (one of her novels has Kira slowly bleeding to death, shot in the back, at its end).  DeMille, writing less as  a \\"realist\\" and more of a \\"larger than life\\" novelist, still is able to bring some basic and often forgotten truths to the page.<br /><br />But don't let all that talk of politics scare you off from reading this page turner fictional story, it's a great spy thriller with all the trimmings and a great story line, I just happen to think it's much more.  If you enjoy this type of fiction, I give this a strong recommendation, if you're new to this type of work, but think you might enjoy a spy thriller with lots of action and a bit of romance, give it a try, I'm betting you'll enjoy the ride.	2004-08-19

Multiple story lines with engaging characters, romance, betrayal and murder, this book could almost fall into the category of \\"female\\" writer (ie Cornwell) except, Turow, in my opinion is simply a better writer than the women authors I've tried in similar categories.  I bring up the point, simply because I feel this book does have appeal for both the more male oriented action thriller reader and the female oriented romance/emotional type story.<br /><br />While much of the story is devoted to \\"non\\" action, and brings in characters just for favor, I didn't feel bogged down (like I did in a couple of the previous works).<br /><br />While some may claim this work is a good argument against the death penalty, and I know the author works in that field in the law, I don't agree.  Perhaps the one weak point in the story is the reason why I don't feel this does anything to sway my feelings, I didn't buy the reason's Turow came up with as to why an innocent man got the death penalty.  In fiction, we accept the \\"it could never happen\\" or at least \\"it's one in a million\\" generally speaking, because, after all, it's fiction, that's the point.  But in real life it doesn't work that way.  This story, at least in today's climate, could probably never happen, so while it still makes a great story, it certainly doesn't qualify as an argument against the death penalty, any more than The Green Mile could be used as an argument, even though, in that fiction, the set up for an innocent being sentenced to death is far more believable.<br /><br />At least times have changed.<br /><br />Back to the story, Turow is excellent in writing dialogue and keeping the characters realistic and human like.  If you've enjoyed Grisham, but would like to read a lawyer story that's not just a quick fun read, but has substantial meat to it, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />If you want total action and gloss, then pass.<br /><br />I give a strong recommendation, this is simply a great story, and even though Turow sets his story in the same town with characters from other books making appearances here, it doesn't matter where you start.ng recommendation, this is simply a great story, and even though Turow sets his story in the same town with characters from other books making appearances here, it doesn't matter where you start.	2004-08-12

It seemed intriguing so I plowed through it.  Now part of the reason I gave it just an average rating wasn't so much because I think the author was some kind of nut, the impression one may get by reading some of the other reviews, but simply because I'm used to excellent writing and more concise topics.  This little book just jumps all over the place, tries to cover too much ground.<br /><br />Now, as to the accuracy of his words, well, much of what he claimed to be happening has indeed been proven true.  The soviets did intent to keep taking as much as they could and the fact that they failed doesn't in anyway prove those worried about it were wrong.<br /><br />American politicians betrayed countless peoples to the insipid and cruel system of communism, and the only people that try and act like that isn't true are either leftists or those ignorant of history.  Our own government was infiltrated by soviet spies, of that fact there's little argument, it's just how many and what they were trying to accomplish and what they did accomplish that brings up two arguing camps.<br /><br />If you're the type that thinks Coulter is a fascist, you'll obviously gain nothing by reading this book.  For others, you have to have an interest in the history of the time to really enjoy this book which reads much like a text book at times.  Part of the reason I gave it only three stars was because of the age of the work and the period it covers, being outdated meant I wasn't able to pick up on a lot of the flavor of the work.<br /><br />If you're doing research on the topic, however, I'd say the book probably would rate a four or five star rating as it gives details and footnotes and covers a lot of ground.	2004-08-04

I'd seen and enjoyed the movie some time ago and it was hard to get the image of John Travolta sitting in a donut shop out of my head.  But I wasn't distracted enough by that image to realize I was seeing a murky and fictional picture of Bill Clintons rise to the White House.<br /><br />I did enjoy this reading, and while I'm a conservative, I think that those on either side that like to follow politics would be entertained and enlightened by reading this fictional novel because it is based on real events to a degree and on real emotions and feelings to a larger degree.<br /><br />Perhaps when Hillary decides to make her initial run for the Democratic nomination for president, this book with get another look, for there is a distant and shady picture of her here  too, and while it is, I understand, fiction, there is  something here of her true self, trying to pick that out is part of the fun.<br /><br />There are some flaws here, in my opinion, one being that some of the fictionalization just went too over the top, and I'm not saying I wish it would have made the main character look worse, he looks bad enough as it is, I'm saying some of the general events in the story were just too overdone.  But such it is with a lot of popular fiction.  A second complaint was that I got the feeling that this was worked on by more than just a good fictional  writer, I sensed some consensus, perhaps a collaboration between an on the scene witness and professional writer.  It's hard to put a finger on it, but I guess I'm saying it didn't quite feel like great fiction, and while I understand it was only loosely based on actual people and actual events (even though there is the standard disclaimer \\"this is total fiction\\") I was left feeling a bit left out.  I wanted some more.<br /><br />In any case, I do recommend this to anyone that has an interest in the \\"inside\\" of politics (at least as they played out back in the early nineties as an unknown Southern governor plotted his way into the White House).(at least as they played out back in the early nineties as an unknown Southern governor plotted his way into the White House). <br />	2004-08-04

It's a page turner in the fiction category I place it in, far above many of the cardboard character driven popular novels that make it to bestseller lists.  It's for that reason I gave it a four, much like I gave The Da Vinci Code a five, not because either book has anything going on that could possibly have happened.<br /><br />It's easy to come up with a complaint here, the book just pushed the edge too far, too much happened, too many \\"that could never happen\\" events and too many coincidences.  A few, I'll take, but really, there's a line.  Perhaps it could have been much shorter and less complicated with better results.<br /><br />In any case, it's a page turner and highly entertainingly, I flew through it in a couple of readings and would have no problem recommending it to any that enjoy this type of fiction, murder/mystery with a bit of Grisham type lawyering thrown in for good measure.	2004-08-04

First off, I don't question  Wilkinsons motives at all, it's apparent he's working to make the world a better place by following the Spirit and second I do question the motives of his detractors, it's easy to go on the radio or publish a book or write a review and bad mouth someone, it's not so easy to go and actually do something positive to change the world.<br /><br />And it's world changing that Wilkinson address here in this book.  If we, as people created by a loving Father, follow the dreams and visions and paths that He as created for us, then we will, but virtue of His nature and His motives, make the world a better place.  If we don't follow our dreams, or ?the Dream? if you will, then we don't make the changes to the world that God intended for us to accomplish.  I believe the most important and poignant point that Wilkinson made in the entire book was near the end, when we was describing a horrible scene in Africa, where a young boy was found on a street corner dead: that scene was a graphic word picture of someone's failed dream.<br /><br />That's a hard pill to swallow, and he makes no bones about pointing out the fact that it is indeed a bitter pill.  But, unfortunately, a true one, if you subscribe to the logic he presents here (and I for one, think he's on a better solid biblical footing).<br /><br />So why the three star rating, instead of a five?  Well, unfortunately, while I find the ideas and ideals and enthusiasm all five stars and great, I'm not going to compare the writing here to C.S. Lewis or Yancey and I also have some problems with the general lack of overall ?balance? (hoping I'm not overusing that word here).<br /><br />For those that happen to like simple allegorical stories, like Hindsfeet on High Places, well, maybe maybe the first part of this book will be enjoyable to you.  I was going nuts and about to scream.  It was short, so I waded through it.  I simply can't stand this kind of reading, I feel like I'm being talked to like I'm a six year old.  Perhaps that's the reading level we Americans have averaged out at, I don't know, but I find it incredibly annoying.<br /><br />The second part of the book, were Wilkinson simply explains what he means, and gives examples from his life, I enjoyed and found helpful.  I think the man has incredible insight and has done much to advance the kingdom.  I also think, perhaps incorrectly, that many people won't wrap all of scripture and logic around the teachings in this book and thus will produce the kinds of abuses that the detractors of this work are prone to point out.  Maybe.  People can be sort of  ?dumb? and there's the rub.  How do you write a simple teaching, one that people will read and understand, without going into a lengthy doctrinal dissertation of all the ?ifs ands and buts??<br /><br />Maybe you can't, and that's a shame.<br /><br />More people in the Christian community need to read Bonhoeffer I'd wager, but lets face it, it's hard work.<br /><br />I do recommend this book, it's got  inspirational teaching which I believe, balanced correctly, is Biblically based and sound.  I also recommend reading works like The Divine Conspiracy, which compared to this short book looks like the Bible itself and perhaps as complicated.  Maybe there's a bit of insight into why some people seem bitter and jealous with the success of Wilkinson's work, it doesn't really seem like it took years of toil and hard labor to write them.  They are relatively short and quick reads and not very complicated.  (While I don't necessarily agree that that fact should lessen the value, I do take it into consideration in my rating of the book.)<br /><br />All in all there two ways to look at this work: one is to simply call it a materialistic capitistic ploy of dubious value to rib off unsuspecting and uncritical Christians and the second is to consider it a catalyst towards joining the Holy Spirit in working out your salvation in the areas of this world that have a special draw or attraction on you.

When  an academic book hits the bestseller lists with such force, I'm going to be cynical here, most people buy it with one of two intentions: either they really intend to improve themselves or they know it'll look good on the bookshelf in the den.<br /><br />Of those that buy for the former reason, I'm guessing 8 of 10 (or maybe 9 of 10) don't actually really read the book, or at least, don't get past the first chapter or two.<br /><br />Now, this little book is good looking, so if you acquire it for the latter reason, you'll no doubt be highly satisfied, it feels good in the hands, the dust jacket is well done, and, there is a cool joke on the back.<br /><br />For those that are serious about improving their use of language through proper use of punctuation, this is a superb book, although, I must admit, it's a bit hard to read at times for non-academics like myself.  Having never attended college (o.k., the truth, I went for part of one semester, long ago) I've learned most of my writing skills by reading a lot and by writing as much as I can.  This book certainly helped me, although please don't use my tortured writing as any kind of representation of the results that can be acquired by a study of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, I just finished it and only read it once.

It was just a one time deal for me, but I gained an insight that will stay with me for a lifetime. Commercial fishing is not only one of the most dangerous jobs it is also one of the most physically demanding. It attracts a certain type of individual, much like those rugged individuals that went west long ago searching for gold, enduring incredible hardship and possible death, the long line fisherman goes to sea hoping to hit a mother lode of fish all the while facing the possibility that the catch may not even pay for the expenses of the trip. The only sure thing, when at sea fishing, are long periods of doubt and loneliness and the nagging thought in the back of your head that you may never set foot on land again.<br /><br /> Lewan took on a huge task when he set out detail the events that lead up to the sinking of the fishing vessel La Conte because he delved into the lives of the crew and some of the Coast Guard rescuers, besides chronicling the day to day events of the fateful fishing run. The result of such detail and precision became, in my opinion, a mixture of pro and con and thus my 4 (actually 4+) rating instead of five. I do appreciate detail, but when Lewan took the time to note that on a certain morning the men had &quot;four&quot; strips of bacon, and not just some &quot;eggs and bacon&quot; or that so and so had coffee, but so and so had milk because he didn't like coffee, well my patience was stretched a bit. I do recall that on the day of the rescue the Coast Guard CO had half a bagel and some Dr. Pepper for breakfast, but I'm not sure why I know this. But these are minor complaints.<br /><br /> Of course this work is going to be compared to &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and this is my opinion: The latter focused upon one main character, and I think that was a strength as it read more like a novel. It also did a better job in explaining and narrating raw facts. This work, however, did have one thing going in its favor: there were survivors and they were able to provide details and drama that &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; could not. Could this work end up being turned into a Hollywood blockbuster? I doubt it. The reason it's a good book isn't because there is much uniqueness to the basic story, it's about some guys that go to sea and their book sinks, it's a good book because Lewan takes us into the lives of the men, their failures, their hopes and their weaknesses. While a book is a perfect place to peek into the lives of several men, a movie could never spend the time. I do recommend this book to any that enjoyed the other, it was a very compelling read and in parts, read like a fast paced fictional thriller.<br /><br /> Imagine a paycheck of twenty thousand dollars earned in just a few days. Now imagine spending half of it in a week on drugs, alcohol and women. Then imagine the rest being taken by the courts and being sent to jail. What do you do when you get out? Why, go fishing of course, after all, where else can a man with nothing, no money, no family, no job, go and have the chance to earn a huge paycheck? A fishing boat.<br /><br /> Lewan tried here a monumental task, to take us into the lives of several men (some desperate, desolate and ruined) and show how, through a series of events, some fateful and some due to carelessness, these men changed (or didn't change), survived or perished. In many ways, the task was too big (and if the work fails to achieve a huge following, this will be why) however, I for one, think I got it. Maybe.

It's the ?Lion and Lamb? repackaged.  I was part way into reading this when I had to ask myself ?gee, doesn't Brennan have any new stories??  Then, after reading about a prayer breakfast with Reagan, I went to check the copyright date and found that this book was first published back in the eighties.  No wonder the stories seemed out of date and no wonder I kept asking myself ?haven't I read this before??<br /><br />While it's true that there was some additional information added, I felt a bit cheated, after all, I got this book as a Fathers Day gift but I really didn't need it, I already had ?Lion and Lamb? in my collection.  Oh well.<br /><br />Ok, the book, whether we are talking about the current title, or the former, is a good insight into the burning desire the Father has for His children.  You and me.  Brennan Manning has a way of getting across the fact, over and over again, that God truly and deeply loves us, wants to be close to us, wants to be an intimate part of our daily lives.<br /><br />There are several chapters here on the true meaning of Christmas.  What the baby Jesus really means.  What it really means to look at the Christ.<br /><br />Brennan hits home on many things he says.  You won't really read this book without stopping to ask yourself ?Why?? and ?How?? and then thinking it's all impossible at the same time noticing a bit of faith growing and sprouting.<br /><br />To be fair I must review the writing and style not just the content.  It isn't always easy reading, the author, in my opinion, tends to ramble a bit and he doesn't bother to make easy chapter and paragraph breaks and headers.  I often get lost in reading his books.  To be totally honest, I never finished ?Lion and Lamb? and perhaps that is why I found ?The Relentless Tenderness of Jesus? in my hands.  I finished it and got something out of it.  But it wasn't always easy.<br /><br />The message, however, is A+ and 5+ stars.  I've heard Brennan speak, and he's a true man of God, a leader, a mystic and a brother in Christ.  He has something special to communicate and I highly recommend this and his other works.s A+ and 5+ stars.

But  I think, over time, he has written stories that fall far from my first impression which happened long ago when I picked up a copy of Cujo and randomly turned to a page that had enough graphic violence to convince me I wasn't interested.  In any case, this is the second fictional work by King I've read (the nonfictional book 'On Writing' is also one I enjoyed greatly).  I was very impressed and quickly caught up in the story that takes place in 1932 at a prison, specifically the death row there called \\"The Green Mile\\".<br />This review is really for those non Stephen King fans that haven't yet taken the plunge with one of Americas favorite writers.  This is a good place to start if you like a good compelling story.  King is a master story teller, and if you've avoided him in the past, like I did, because the blood and gore stuff wasn't your style, I think this book might be a good place to find out what a great story teller King is.  The other work I've read, \\"Deloris Clairborne\\"  is also a great story (and great movie too) that really doesn't have that much in the way of \\"blood and guts gore.\\"  In any case, this story is moving.<br />I had seen the movie twice before reading this book and I found that it didn't inflict any injury on the story, and in fact, I was impressed by how well the movie was done after reading the book.  I kept picturing Tom Hanks as I read the story, like he was really the guy I was reading about.  If you like the movie, by all means, jump into the book, it's really very good.  If you're unsure, watch the movie first, if you enjoy it, you'll like reading the book and I don't think seeing the movie first ruins it at all.<br />In Kings 'On Writing' in which he describes some of his views on writing fiction, he gives a little bit of insight into how he approached writing \\"The Green Mile\\".  One of the interesting things he mentioned was that as he was writing this book, he didn't know if the main condemned character was going to live or die at the end.  He brings that tension to the page so much so, that even though I knew the outcome the anxiety was still there.  I give this novel a strong recommendation.riting this book, he didn't know if the main condemned character was going to live or die at the end.

US	51062124	R2V929ONQC2A03	0446602450	454060985	Spencerville	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Fun read	I really enjoy DeMille's work and this was no exception.  The story here is a bit lighter and more of a smaller scale, then some of his other books, which isn't to say there isn't jealously, rape, stalking and murder, but that it mostly follows the action of the protagonist trying to win back his old flame and rescue her from the clutches of an evil and demented husband.<br />For people that like the \\"damsel in distress\\" type story, with plotting, action, revenge and love, this is definitely a winner, it's kind of a romance for the male market, not that woman wouldn't  enjoy it too.  It could actually make a decent flick, the bad guy is pretty straight forward and the good guy is pretty straight forward and it isn't long before you're rooting for the good guy to win the girl and kick the bad guys rear.  The aren't a lot of twists and turns or mysteries here, it's pretty predictable, the good guy just screws up enough to give us drama.<br />In any case, while I give it four stars because it's a lessor story than some of DeMille's bigger novels, it's still a very fun and quick read and I give it a strong recommendation to those that like this kind of story.  If you're unfamiliar with his work, check out \\"The Gold Coast\\" which is a classic and very much worth reading.	2004-05-23
US	51062124	R2GD6VRGZ4NFSU	0312320175	142366218	Showdown: Confronting Bias, Lies and the Special Interests That Divide America	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Good message	Larry Elder has many good points and many good things to say in this book, however, my  chief compliant about the book is that he's all over the place and not focused enough on one issue.  A large part of his text could have been snippets transcribed straight from his radio show.  He often writes the way he talks.  And sometimes it gets confusing.<br />That said, Mr. Elder has some good research behind his message and this book has many footnotes.  He does make use of solid logic, but sometimes goes off on tangents that are a little bit edgy when it comes to trying to go full circle back to his original point.  Mr. Elder, Larry, Sage, send me your next manuscript and let me proof it for you, please...<br />In any case, while this book doesn't read with the same polish that you'll find in Ann Coulter, Elder has stepped up to the plate with some strong stuff to say about liberals and conservatives both.  Any interested in the state of the union from someone that is fighting against the \\"victim\\" state of America will find interesting analysis here and probably some points of fact that hadn't been previously thought about.<br />The welfare state in America has to go and Larry shows why he believes this same \\"victim\\" thinking, using a coined word \\"victacrat\\", is fueling the fire in world terrorism and how the Democratic party and liberals in general have failed to realize how the policies they espouse actually make the problems they are trying to solve worse.<br />I do recommend this book, however, it's written in a more conversational style, than  academic style, which in and of itself would be a good thing, but as a writer, Elder falls a little short when I go to rank the writing itself (independent of the message).	2004-05-20

Turow is a master at writing dialogue, it seems to flow naturally off the page and it makes all the characters believable and either likable, dislikable or downright hated.<br />I would certainly recommend reading this before seeing the movie if I had my choice, but don't skip it even if you already know the ending.  The writing here is just plain excellent and I give this one a very strong recommendation.	2004-05-20

Before you write off this book as merely being something only the right wing red neck reader will enjoy as Ann Coulter preaches to the choir, before you decide my five star rating automatically deserves an \\"unhelpful\\" vote as far as reviews go, think for a minute, or even a second, what if she's right?  What if she's right even about a small portion of what she declares as being true in this book on the treasonous behavior of the left?<br />Would it perhaps rate your attention for more than a sneer or a quick retort about how she's just a right wing demagogue?<br />Ann Coulter has  chronicled the behavior of liberals and their Democratic party and its  presidents that have not only acted treasonously against the United States, but have dismissed millions, tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions to death, torture, \\"reeducation\\" camps and misery.  That millions have been butchered due to policies put in place and advocated by the Democratic party would seem to be an outrageous statement unworthy of further review if advanced by someone that wasn't such a brilliant writer and thinker and so well documented.  The reason that Ann Coulter is so violently hated by the left is simply because  her brilliance and logic cannot simply be set aside, those that fail to read the truthfulness of her words do so at their own peril.<br />Her words remind us of how dangerous a world we live in and how dangerous it was once under the ominous threat of the Soviet Union.  Reagan's policies and actions lead directly to the down fall of the Soviets (she provides enough documentation here that coupled with common sense and anything other than a blind hatred for Reagan will convince the reader of what a true hero he really is).  The current war on terror can be won too, if we as a nation will only allow ourselves to be reminded of the past, and not embark on the course of the Democratic Party which, since World War II has fought, seemingly, on the side of America's enemies.  Or not so \\"seemingly\\" as the case my be, some leftists don't even pretend to root for America as she again documents with clarity.<br />Ann Coulter does a wonderful job of reminding the reader of the past and paralleling it with current events.  This is perhaps the best strength of this work.  She makes comparisons that allows the reader to see how disloyal and vile the actions of Democratic party were in the past, how through their collective power of the vote here in America  so many lives in other parts of the world were systematically destroyed and at the same time our national defense was diminished.  Today we face similar threats and she reminds us, shows us, over and over again, how the liberals in America fight to destroy what most Americas hold dear.<br />The history lesson on Joseph McCarthy was especially enlightening.  Several times she writes \\"most of you will be reading/hearing about this person/event for the first time.\\"  She explains how the left was so successful at demonizing a man that later, long after he was dead, long after liberals had convinced us all how evil he was, he was finally proven to be totally correct.  Secret cables from the Soviet Union were finally declassified in 1995.  The left was totally wrong and evil in it's behavior, Ann Coulter points out, but enough of the myth had been spoken over and over that by the time the real truth came it, it was a little too late for most people to understand what really had happened.<br />The war on terrorism will be won or lost depending on how the politicians in America decide to fight it is one of the points I take away from my reading of Ann Coulter's book.  Will they act honorably or treasonous?  I firmly believe that she has made a very compelling case that Republican Presidents tend to act with honor and with America's best interest at heart when it comes to fighting tyranny and terror and that Democratic Presidents tend to act without honor and without America's best interest at heart when it comes to fighting tyranny and terror, thus the apt title of this book \\"Treason\\".<br />I give it one of my strongest recommendations and further claim that not reading it before voting is simply to put your head in the sand.comes to fighting tyranny and terror, thus the apt title of this book \\"Treason\\".<br />I give it one of my strongest recommendations and further claim that not reading it before voting is simply to put your head in the sand.	2004-05-11

I've enjoyed many Grisham novels and wanted to try out some other legal thrillers and see what they were like.  Turow is a good writer, without question, but he lacks, at least in this book, some of the flash or pizzaz I was hoping for after reading others.  This novel is definitely not a page turning thriller, but it is a solid story.<br />Some of the legal complications get hard to follow unless you have at least a minimal grasp of how financial markets work, but basic evil is usually pretty easy to spot so don't let the setting throw you off.  Turow obviously works at his craft with some measure of pride, so I don't count the few words and/or concepts that are over my head get the better of me, the context makes the actions plain enough.<br />So the real question is do I give this book a recommendation?  Well, yes. It's an entertaining mystery/legal setting type book and while it doesn't read with the same speed and ease of some others, it's still worth checking out.	2004-04-27

The dialogue is exceptional, the settings and action believable and yet not predictable.  The story unfolded in such a way that I was sure that both I and the author would end up lost, but I was wrong for the most part.<br />I won't give away any secrets or endings, but they weren't cookie cutter or generic, and in today's market, that's saying a lot.  The characters were flawed but likable and their actions made sense and not only that, they behaved in ways that never made me think \\"yeahhh righhhht\\".  That's saying a lot too.<br />Now, the reasons for being just under 5 stars:  Turow writes hard core, sometimes he just has too much fun, which I'm sure is great for him, but for the reader, well, I was often saying \\"get on with the story!\\"  The characters were great, but he fleshes out them out too much at times and I often had trouble remembering who was who and who did what and why it mattered.  The page turning action sometimes seemed to be missing totally, and at other times it just took too long to get there.<br />Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  When I got near the end I couldn't put it down and it read like any other high concept action thriller, the work getting there was totally paid off and then some.  Any one looking for an easy fast-paced read should keep looking, but if you're looking for a real slice of life in a legal/FBI/corruption thriller/mystery with a touch of romance, you'll really enjoy this book.	2004-04-27

No matter how powerless and no matter how little influence they have.<br />A good message and written as a moving story that even little kids can follow along with even if they can't grasp the entirety of the message.<br />I don't know if Dr. Suess meant this story to be a pro life message, but it certainly works for that cause.

Spot on.  Bingo.  It's here.  I give the book a strong recommendation to any looking to strengthen their marriage or to any planning on getting married.<br />It's easy for some to vilify Dr. Laura but if you (as a woman) have ever been successfully married you've either followed her advice or you weren't all that happily married (or at least your husband was miserable).  She makes it very clear that the book isn't written for relationships that are abusive and that in normal non-abusive relationships men are actually very similar and pretty much want the same things in their marriages:  the  respect of their wives, lots of physical intimacy and a good home from their children.<br />As for the overall quality of the book and the writing, I'd say it's about average.  It is a short book and a lot of it is filler, quotes, examples and stories.  I read it in a few hours and did find it entertaining as well as informative.  In defense of the authors style and the length of the book, I'd like to point out that to help the average person, a book can't be to long and complicated, it simply won't get read, so overall, I'd not say the length and style are a detriment.  My biggest complaint was that it simply ended, there wasn't a conclusion or final chapter, the last chapter was just the last chapter.<br />As for those people, women or men, that can't stand the idea of a wife respecting and honoring her husband, loving him and caring for him, it's fine if you feel that way as a single person but you're setting yourself up  for a failed marriage if you think somehow you're so special that the laws of human nature and the spirit of man are somehow unique in your situation.  They aren't.  I highly highly recommend this book to anyone that's engaged or thinking about it.

It's a fast paced action novel, so it was an entertaining read, however, and this is a big however, the characters were bland, there was no clear protagonist and the story revolved around a lot of pretty unbelievable stuff.<br />If you can get past all that then you'll probably enjoy reading this thriller too.  Brown writes in much the same way that Crichton does, they come up with some totally unbelievable \\"could never happen\\" idea and develop it into an entertaining yarn.  Since strong story telling is far more important then raw facts and data, they are both successful in engaging the reader.<br />Perhaps of the four Brown books mentioned here, this one is the most likely to become a movie, simply because it has the least amount of wild stuff to explain, like ancient brotherhoods, secret codes, historical monuments, etc.  The computer stuff is always glossed over in the movies so this one would probably work, a giant computer used by the government is being attacked by hackers and a beautiful and very smart \\"top of her field\\" heroine must save the day.	2004-04-13

It basically was the same type of novel with the same type of suspense and I wasn't disappointed.<br />While Brown's writing style is not classical literature by any means, and sometimes borders the obscenely ridiculous, it is fast paced and action filled and I can't seem to stop turning the pages until I get to the conclusion of the mystery he lays out from page one.<br />While my high rating doesn't mean I rate this as being on par with some of the other genres I read, this book certainly ranks on the top of the pile with others in it's type.

The first way is simply to say I read it without wanting to put it down as it was fast paced, exciting and a fun book to read.  The second way is to say that it was based on a totally ridiculous premise and was way way over the top.<br />If you get hung up on technical problems, unrealistic scenarios, villains that make dumb mistakes and hero's that get rescued at the last second by miraculous means, then skip this book because it will just make you mad.  If, however, you can look past the problems and just enjoy the story, you'll enjoy this novel as Brown is a strong story teller.

US	51062124	RO30TYK0OEIYS	0312955731	905180108	White Shark	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Greenie Ranting	Well I read the whole book, even though it wasn't exactly what I was hoping it would be based upon my remembrance of reading 'Jaws'.  In the novel 'Jaws' we are enfolded into the lives of several people and how they deal with a monster shark terrorizing a small town dependent upon tourism for their livelihood.  Here, in 'White Shark',  we are subjected to Benchley's ranting and raving and preaching about environmental issues, we are given cardboard characters that are predictable and a monster that is unbelievable science fiction.<br />I guess the author thought that if he called a book 'White Shark'  we the readers wouldn't mind if he substituted an evil monster fish man created by Nazi's at the end of World War Two.  Opps, I spoiled the surprise, however, in my defense, the subject comes up in the first chapter.  There is a great white shark in the book, however, she plays a secondary role and doesn't eat anyone.  Benchley, I think, when he wrote this book, was still feeling some guilt about presenting sharks as evil when he wrote 'Jaws', however, I don't think he chose a good vehicle to preach his greenie beliefs and I don't think resorting to a Nazi bad guy is the best way to make sure you present a monster that can be killed off without offending anyone.<br />I'm not sure how to rate this book, it was interesting enough to finish reading, however, I don't know what to characterize it as, and find it hard to rate in a certain category, which is usually how I rate things, how they stack up against other similar books.  Because I can't exactly call it average, I'm going to go with a two star, but it may be a little bit better than that to those that enjoy this type of work.	2004-02-09
US	51062124	RW825D9REHQ1D	0345354613	760372128	Eaters of the Dead	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Exciting read	This book is presented as an account of an Arab traveler taken along a quest with Vikings around a thousand years ago.  Crichton does a good job of presenting the text as an historical account and in many ways this reads as an interesting historical narrative of true events.  The story is a fairly quick read and I think any that enjoy action/adventure stories set in the distant past would like it.<br />Because of the footnotes and eyewitness type narrative done in a fictional novel, it's hard to know what customs and beliefs presented are actual and what are totally made up.  It all reads as true to life, and I suppose that is what makes it so interesting.  I'm going to guess that Crichtons presentation of customs and rituals such as the one in which the Viking men can and do take any of the slave woman at will, often several times a day, is completely made up, a males fantasy indeed, however it makes for interesting reading and  I'm sure it's intertwined with some customs that are actually factual.<br />I saw the movie when it first came out, and that fact didn't diminish the reading of the novel.  I'd also like to point out that, unlike Timeline, in which Crichton takes characters back in time in a time traveling machine, this book supposes an eyewitness account of a foreigner traveling to distant lands back at the time the adventure happened and that Crichton merely translated the story for us from several scholarly texts.  I liked this approach better as it wasn't as fantastic or as hard to shallow.<br />In any case, while this book is hardly classical literature, it's a fun read and I give it a good recommendation.	2004-02-09

I have never been interested in the Western genre, but since I knew I liked the author here, I thought I'd give it a try.<br />The problem with reviewing this book is that I'm not familiar with Western's so I have nothing to compare it too.  From my perspective, this book was all right, but not really my cup of tea.  Is that because I don't like the genre or because it wasn't done as well as the normal Western?  I have no idea.  I will say I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book and I really liked reading the after word in which Trevanian tells what happened to the characters in real life after the adventure/tragedy that came into their lives.<br />I'd recommend this book to someone interested in Western's, even though it's not Trevanian's normal territory, it's a well written book (albeit a bit slow and laborious at times) and because the book is based on real events, it's historically interesting even though much of it is conjecture.  I do think it would make a very good movie, if cast and adapted correctly, simply because the story is pretty straight forward, main action all happens in the course of just a few days, and the bad guy is evil enough and interesting enough to grab and hold interest.	2004-02-09

I did enjoy it.  There's  sleazy lawyers and back room deals, women and money and expensive jets.  Basically Grisham pokes fun at lawyers and sort of spoofs some of the stuff that  goes on in the world of law, specifically mass torts and class action.<br />I realize that some of his works are not nearly as good as the first novel he produced, 'A Time to Kill', which really is a more serious novel than many of his others, but none the less, this one is fun to read, just don't expect serious literature and you'll probably not be disappointed.  If you want a strong plot with meaningful characters and realistic situations and no fantasy, go elsewhere, but otherwise, it's an enjoyable read if you like the genre.	2004-02-01

If you like suspense/mystery/cop/thillers this is it.  Middle East terrorist stuff, love, sex, guns, murder, this book has it all.<br />I found a fault in \\"Plum Island\\" and it was that the antagonist wasn't believable enough because the book was written in the first person in its entirety and therefore the actions of the bad guy only happened in front of the main character.  The Plum Island story preceded this book so read that first if you haven't already been turned on to DeMille.  There is enough back story so that you don't have to read it first, but it would make the second book better in my opinion.<br />Anyway, in this one, DeMille uses the first person in a chapter and then goes to the third person in a chapter, jumping back and forth between our hero and the murderous terrorist.  What it does is make the novel flow much better than the previous one and turn it into a real blockbuster.  It is interesting how much better a novel is when you are able to feel and empathize with the bad guy a little bit.  Excellent story the whole way through.<br />I can't recommend DeMille enough, he has it all, page turning books with suspense and a wonderful sense of humor.  And when I say funny, I really mean good solid witty humor here, the man has a razor sharp wit and a great insight into the male/female relationship.  Strong recommendation here, it's my second favorite after \\"The Gold Coast\\" which is a novel in a class by itself.	2004-01-18
US	51062124	R30P3CYFNJXOBP	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very good read.	First off I must state that I saw the movie based upon this book before I read the book.  Sometimes that is better than reading the book first, however, in this case, I don't think it would have changed my opinion either way, the book was very good and I didn't mind the fact that I already knew how it was going to turn out.<br />My complaint, if I were to state one, would be that the book is not told from the first person, so that we are shown the viewpoints of many characters and yet don't quite get to have someone to really root for.  I guess the cop is probably the  protagonist, and I imagined him looking like Kevin Bacon since that was who played him in the movie.  But Shawn Penn did such a good job in the role on screen, I couldn't quite shake the idea that he was the star of the book too, although, really, he wasn't.  In any case, the book was a good suspenseful read and I recommend it to any that enjoy well thought out murder mysteries that have more going for them then the standard soap opera/romance version of a mystery.<br />I didn't put this book down, but I will say it was a bit more of a struggle than your average thriller, which is to say, it was very good, but not light reading.  There is some struggle and tension throughout the book and I believe it was handled well by the author.<br />The story takes you into the mind of a man that was abused as a child and  it describes his inner struggle to be a better person (husband and father) and overcome his fears and nightmares.  It also takes you into the mind of a man that is able to overcome the world in many ways because of his innate intelligence and charm, yet is stricken by tragedy that he cannot control.  The third mind we see into is the that of a police officer who is both confident and successful except in his most important relationship and how that effects his thinking and struggle.<br />I give it a strong recommendation and as an aside, I think the movie was well done and won't seem disappointing if you read the book first, nor was the book spoiled in anyway, in my opinion, by seeing the movie first.ting if you read the book first, nor was the book spoiled in anyway, in my opinion, by seeing the movie first.	2003-12-30

As usual, Crichton goes over the top a bit, but  that being expected, I wasn't disappointed with this story, it was a quick read and a page turner and basically a good story.  The ending had enough of a twist that it wasn't entirely predictable and the characters were interesting enough.  It won't come as a surprise to any that read Crichton that the story involves a situation that could never really happen, but is grounded in enough science and theory to challenge the readers imagination.<br />This story will undoubtedly be turned into a movie, there is an element of horror possible here and if the movie is done right, it could be pretty scary.  I recommend this to any that enjoy science fiction/fantasy type quick reading novels that haven't yet tried out the authors work.  If you already like his work, this book is not the mistake that the novel  Jurassic Park The Lost World is and is not quite as fantastic as the novel Timeline, if you have any interest in the world of nanotechnology it will be thought provoking at the least.	2003-12-27

I enjoy non fiction and have lately devoted most of my reading to it, but I wasn't sure what I was going to be getting when I read the description of &quot;My Losing Season&quot;. After all, who cares about an unknown college basketball team that played in the sixties?<br />I haven't read all of Mr. Conroy's books yet, not because I don't think he is one of the great writers of all time, but because I know that I'll only get to read them once for the first time. My introduction into his worlds of fiction caught me by surprise because I was well into 'The Prince of Tides' before I realized that the book wasn't a true story. I now realize after reading 'My Losing Season' that everything he writes is true, even the fiction.<br />I would have broken down crying several times during the reading of this book, but my heart is still guarded by never sleeping sentinels whose tireless detail is to walk the stone walls that guard my interior. Mr. Conroy manages to gain an entrance, however, and at times during reading his work I feel a sense of hatred towards him. Not meanness, just anger with no where to go.<br />So what is it about this book, this story that makes it so worth reading? The nakedness that Pat Conroy brings to the page. The truth. Simple and raw and courageous. Enduring and joyful, sad and painful.<br />I envy his memories, his legacy, his past, not because I feel that the journey was easy or he was lucky, but because whatever molded him into the man he became, whatever blessing or curse that was bestowed him at birth, whatever angels or demons followed his path, he has been able to live outside of the shells and caves and fortresses that most of us dwell in. Or at least he has done so enough to make a difference.<br />While I can't recommend 'My Losing Season' enough, I do have one slight reservation, that being I don't know whether or not a first time reader will enjoy it more before or after they've read one of his previous books. But do read it, whether or not you are familiar with basketball, military colleges or the journey of broken boys trying to become men, you will turn the last page wishing there was more.

In just a little over a hundred pages this dissertation on screenwriting takes the reader on a journey through several \\"high concept\\" movies, explains from the authors viewpoint some of the metaphors for real life found in these films and makes some conclusions about successful movie making in general.  Are these specific rules true to all successful high concept movies?, I'm not sure, could it be that the movies picked for examples fit the conclusions? I'm going to leave that to other readers to decide for themselves but the insights are interesting.<br />There are plenty of footnotes and quotes in this book, the author certainly did lot's of homework, but I wasn't always sure if some of his conclusions about what certain articles in movies, or certain acts by the actors or directors really meant what he concludes they meant.  However, whether he is always on spot or not, the \\"thinking about it\\" part of the read was interesting and entertaining and I enjoy thinking about and discussing the theoretical blend of reality with fiction.<br />Some of the movies discussed here are 'Titanic', Disney's animated version of 'Tarzan', 'The Beach', 'Fight Club' and 'Seven'.  There are many others and he includes an extensive filmography and bibliography at the end of the work.  The author makes some assertions about how audiences view the movie and how the movie acts as a both a piece of fiction and as something bigger than that.  From the back cover: \\"fiction is like magic; you cannot explain it or it will break the spell, ruin the magic.\\"  Of course that brings to light a  paradox, a book on screenwriting fiction, acknowledging that you cannot really explain the magic, yet attempting to break the spell anyway.  He goes on to say \\"...there are no two rational ways of making a rabbit appear from a hat.\\"  Perhaps.  But perhaps not.  Perhaps the magic is deeper still, unexplainable and ambiguous and in multiple forms.<br /> Yet, agreeably, there are some themes, some rules that are simply inescapable when it comes to good stories, whether they be screenplays or novels.<br />Is there really, as a blurb on the back cover states \\"recipes the entertainment industry wants to keep secret?\\"  Maybe.  I've always believed that if you could tell a good story, people will listen, but it is true that certain rules (generally)  must be adhered to for success in any industry.<br />I recommend this work to any that have a desire to get all the information they can on successful screenwriting, to get into the mind of one that believes he has found some universal secrets to great films.  I'm going to complain here that the price of the book, in relation to the size is a bit steep, and it could have used a little more polishing in the editing process.  It is not a \\"nuts and bolts\\" or \\"how to book\\" however, so keep in mind that the book assumes a basic knowledge already in place  for fictional story telling and script or screen writing in general.<br />For those serious about writing screenplays how do you place a cost on even one good idea?

The book is well organized and has lots of examples.  The negative is that some of the sections probably won't be good examples to each reader so that even though something here will be helpful, not all of it will, but you still have to pay for it all.  The other problem is that most of it is geared towards the big players, those with national scope and budgets.<br />I don't necessarily regret getting this however, because the cost, if you consider the cost of taking a class, isn't really that bad, the book has value and I did learn some new things.  I'd also recommend Sugarman's book on copy writing, he doesn't get as much into layout as this one does, but he really gets into the nuts and bolts of writing stories as copy and compelling people to act.  This book is less of a \\"how to\\" course and more of a \\"here it is\\" now go and do likewise course.<br />Hatch has spent years collecting and organizing mass mailings and here he presents the best of the best and gives advice on how to use some of this information in your own campaigns.

Some will look at with a jaundiced eye and give it a low rating, some will think carries great worth backed up with lots of research and give it a high rating.<br />I can sum up the gist of the book with one sentence.  The stock market is often way overvalued and buying during those times will give poor return even if stocks are held for long periods.  This information is valuable, but unfortunately, most of the type of people that get killed when the market corrects will not be the ones that read a book like this.<br />As for me, I'm not even an investor, just a student looking to gain knowledge about markets in general.  I found a lot of this book to be hard to read and filled with too many statistics and mathematical formulas.  It could have been written in a more basic conversational tone and still have all the charts and math in an appendix.<br />I can assure the reader that no stock broker is going to being singing the praises of this work, it simply states something they won't want to hear.  There are times, and we may still be in such a time, that the stock market is simply overbought and money would be better off sitting on the side lines waiting for prices to be more realistic.  I happen to agree with the basics they present here, they made a logical argument, and certainly the last bubble that burst proved that they weren't blowing smoke.  As to the future, only time will tell, but with P/E ratios being so high, if I had to decide, I'd go with their analysis.	2003-12-07

I wasn't  let down, this read kept me up late turning page after page, waiting for  conclusions to problems and answers to secrets.  It takes a huge amount of skill, research and patience to make a book of this scope come together, to be concluded well and not leave stings untied.  This is indeed a mystery/thriller that is highly recommended and I must mention I had my doubts when I saw that it was selling so well.<br />The controversial portions of this book are good reading too, and shouldn't be taken necessarily as fact, or even supposed fact, this isn't a scholarly thesis, it's a work of fiction.  Before the book starts, Brown notes that \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\"  This is good to know and makes the reading honest, however it is important to note he doesn't make the claim that all hypothesis and conclusions are fact, that would have been presumptuous on his part and he doesn't go that far.  It is also fair to say that the fictional characters actually believe what they say they believe, and this can only be controversial if we suppose that some of the fictional statements are meant to be put forward as fact, especially conclusions that suppose the New Testament is itself mostly fictional.<br />To what degree Brown believes or doesn't believe some of the conclusions reached by the characters about the nature of Christ and what secrets the Church has hidden over the years does not detract from the brilliance of this work, and I wouldn't recommend passing this over merely because of some of the controversy, however, be forewarned, some of the statements and conclusions drawn by the characters are indeed inflammatory and quite possibly offensive to some.<br />I am not offended reading challenges to my belief's and  I love mysteries, history, hidden meanings, and especially I love women so I found this work highly enjoyable and again recommend it  highly to any that love well written mysteries especially  those that have an historical backdrop.love women so I found this work highly enjoyable and again recommend it  highly to any that love well written mysteries especially  those that have an historical backdrop.	2003-11-29

Why?  Because the tricks of the trade and hidden fees are going to eat into your profits and at the very least you should want to know where your money is going.

For that I recommend it highly and believe it is definitely worth the investment of time and money.<br />The downside was that a couple of the interviews were pretty useless for the average person, some of the traders have very complex computer trading systems and some use methods that require millions in capital or extensive understanding of legal aspects and other disqualify (for the average person) criteria.  Nobody that is in that league would gain anything from the short interviews here, and the rest of us don't gain much.<br />That being said the rest of the stories were either very encouraging or very helpful or both.  Those interviews give a great overview of methodology used by the various traders  and at the end of each chapter Schwager gives a recap that I found to be very enlightening.  Also at the end of the book he gives a long list he calls \\"wizard lessons\\" and these as well are worth the time to go over.  The bottom line here is if you are going to put money in the market, this book is certainly one to go over.  One important lesson learned by using someone else's mistakes can be a huge windfall.<br />I recently reviewed another good book called \\"The Honest Thief\\".  The title to that book sounds like an oxymoron, however, this is a perfect example of what an honest thief does: \\"steal\\" the knowledge that other traders had to pay real money for.<br />If you bought this book and just read the end  of chapter reviews, you'd easily get your money's worth, a strong recommendation for any interested in the stock market.	2003-10-28

This will give the investor \\"diversity\\".  The author contents that the \\"world\\" market will outperform the S&P by a little bit, assuming history stays its course.  But that increase in percentage is small, and he fails to mention that the load paid will probably bring the return down  below or around the rate an investor would receive investing in an index fund.<br />Basically what he is promoting is investing in an \\"index\\" of the world, by buying a basket of mutual funds that are spread throughout the worlds markets.  By his own admission, you'll probably never get great returns on this, however, if you are looking for the least possible risk, this is it (or so he claims).<br />Currency fluctuations are downplayed because they can effect the purchasing power of the dollar as well, even in a 100% US fund, so there is risk in staying in dollars just like there is risk in being in foreign currency, he claims, so you might as well be in a whole bunch of currencies, that way, you'll average out.<br />I am going to assume that anyone that would wade through this book, and actually understand it, is the kind of person that is willing to do the work required to beat or at least have a good chance to \\"beat the market\\".  The kind of person that wouldn't spend the time to read this book is probably the kind of person that would be more likely to invest in mutual funds (not wanting to do their own research) and would probably profit by an understanding of how different markets work and how currency fluctuations work and have an effect on purchasing power.<br /> There is the catch twenty two and also the reason why I don't give much of a recommendation for reading it.  If you want global diversity, then buy global funds.  However, if you believe, like I tend to, that mutual fund managers, with the huge amount of money they have to deal with, probably can't outperform a hard working and researching investor, much less beat the market by much in general, then this book certainly isn't for you.  The author doesn't give nearly as much weight to how much the load effects overall returns when investing in funds as he should have.  If he had included that effect, his numbers would have showed that investing in the S&P would handily beat the \\"world\\" market.  At least if you go by past performance.  Of course using past performance to prove a point is risking too.<br />If you want to have market performance, simply buy an index fund, it'll be cheaper than going around buying a bunch of mutual funds.  If you're worried that the dollar will lose value, you can hedge your investment (which is being held in USD)  by shorting the dollar against several major currencies.<br />In my opinion, this book has little value, anyone smart enough to figure out the point he is trying to make is probably smart enough not to need it.

Krieger includes some of this, like how he'd spend 18 to 20 hours a day in front of a computer and wonder about his life.  But he just didn't get in depth enough.<br />He covers a lot of history, but again, it was not enough if history was what you were looking for.  In my case, it was a bit much, I really didn't need to hear so much about the specific names and dates, I wanted more of the individual trading side of his story, what he did and why.  How it worked or didn't.<br />Of course, this book is totally out of date.  For that reason, it is actually even more interesting in a way, as the author has no idea how FX trading will advance.<br />The book itself offers no specific strategies or advice on investing in the FX market, however, I guess that would make sense as when it was written, only pro's or people with a lot of cash could enter this market.<br />If Krieger were to decide to write a modern work, covering the topic of trading \\"inside the trillion-dollar world of currency trading\\" as the cover states, it would be something I'd love to read.  I can't recommend this work currently, without the caveat that the reader realize it's limited value as far as trading in today's market.  The history, however, is interesting as is the limited view the author gives us as to his trading.  Whether the price of the book is worth paying, I'd recommend it only to the reader that is sure of what they are getting.	2003-10-23

I am interested in learning, however, leading me to try this book out as it has received some good reviews here at Amazon.  Much of it was way over my head and too confusing to do me any good.  But some of the information was very good and very understandable and for that information I felt my investment in terms of both time and money was well spent with this work.<br />One of the things the author says near the end of the book is that it will take four or five readings for some of the information to sink in.  And that's for people who actually know the topic to begin with.  I can understand why; trading seems so easy when looked at from a distance, just buy low and sell high, hey, anyone can be a millionaire!  Of course it isn't so easy and most people end up losing money or at least not making enough to justify the time spent.<br />I think the most important and helpful part of this book is the teaching on what many call \\"money management\\" (often erroneously); that the author refers to as \\"position sizing.\\"  This topic is part of investing that many over look.<br />I understood and appreciated this subject from the days (long past) that I used to enjoy both the ponies and blackjack.  Position sizing in both these pursuits is vital and understanding why you don't sit at the $5 blackjack table with only $40 bucks, you go to the $2 table or get more money, is the same understanding you need when figuring out how much to \\"bet\\" when making trades in the stock market relative to your overall investment size (simply put \\"what percentage is at risk?\\")  If you sit at the blackjack table with $40 and bet $5, you are risking too much with one \\"trade.\\"<br />The other helpful part was how to look at \\"expectancy.\\"  What is the expectant overall rate of return based on both the success rate AND the amount won and lost on those respective trades.  In other words, you can be wrong 70 percent of the time and still make money just as you can be right 70 per cent of the time and still lose money.  The authors coverage of this area, and how some people put too much emphasis on one or two areas of investing was very helpful to me.<br />The area of entry's and exit's was covered well too.  When too much consideration is put into entry's, without considering position sizing, expectancy and exit strategies, then the investor will be at a severe disadvantage.<br />While still a neophyte, I can give this book a  recommendation to any that don't mind some difficult reading, it covers a lot of ground and makes a lot of sense in places while being overworked and confusing in others.  I found it helpful that the author covers multiple strategies and why or how each one works or doesn't and how that system could be improved with (sometimes subtle) changes.<br />I also checked out the web site associated with Van K. Tharp's work and I'll concur with those that say \\"beware\\", because he is definitely out to sell something besides just this book.  Whether that is a warning sign or not, is up to the individual.time and still make money just as you can be right 70 per cent of the time and still lose money.

The information here is great, however, if you're looking for a cheerleading \\"rah-rah\\" type book.  Personally, I was interested in more of the nut's and bolts of selling and business than in personal achievement, so I wasn't as happy with this book as I would have been had it filled the reason I bought it.<br />That being said, I'm still giving it a four star rating, because the information here is solid and I'd recommend it to someone starting out or as a gift to a graduate or that type of thing.  If you're already grinding out the day to day stuff, you either know that you need goals and that you should stay in shape and get adequate sleep and smile when you shake hands, etc; or you don't.  If you don't, this book probably won't cause you to change habits, in fact, you won't bother reading it in the first place.<br />That's probably the biggest problem with this type of book, those that really need it will never read it.  The used copy I bought was personally signed by the authors.  I wonder if the salesperson that originally bought it ever read it.  Probably not, or it'd still by on her shelf...	2003-10-21

It is told from one perspective, of course, so you have to trust you are getting the straight line, I for one, felt that Cramer was honest and shared his own short comings in a way that many people aren't capable of doing.  It would have been interesting, perhaps, to have had his wife write a few chapters here and there, just to give us another pair of eyes.<br />In any case, for those interested in trading, the stock market or just another great American rages to riches story, this is it.  Perhaps it would make a great movie.<br />I give this book a strong recommendation, I really enjoyed reading it and I also think I got a lot out of it in terms of understanding the market and how so many of the institutions set in place are there to fleece the public.  Cramer expounds more on this subject in the short book he wrote called \\"You Got Screwed!\\" another one worth reading if you are in or considering get into the stock market.	2003-10-21

If one good idea comes of a quick reading, then the book has paid for itself, no problem.<br />I would like to say I was put off  by the authors left wing ranting and felt it was out of place.  In fact, I pretty much lost respect for her and it hurt my opinion of the rest of the book.  I guess if you're a leftie, you'd probably be more inclined to feel she's a market wiz, and won't mind her silly attacks on the right.<br />In either case, when it comes to business, ideas are ideas, so a quick scan of this book may lead to a good idea, and the cost is low enough to justify buying it.	2003-10-21

It is a totally worthless book for any that are already seasoned in the business, however, for the neophyte or unlearned investor that has money on the line already, this book could prove priceless.<br />Some time back I reviewed a book called \\"Net Zero\\", also a book describing how the bubble burst.  I wrote in my review that the problem with the book was that it was much to technical for the beginner, i.e. the guy that really needs to read it.  So the simple fact that this book is short, basic and too the point, shouldn't be considered a negative unless you already know the information.<br />If you're considering putting money into the market for the first time, and you don't already understand why the market tanked and how certain parts of the industry are stinking thieves, then you'd be foolish to pass on reading it.  It could save you a fortune.	2003-10-21

Period.  It covers so much in terms of how to not lose during negotiations, whether money or other issues are at stake.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to the raw beginner, not just yet, however, anyone that has been around more than a month in a selling environment needs this information.<br />There are many books that have good information, but are not well written.  This isn't one of them.  Well written, easy to follow and filled with no nonsense advice.<br />Anyone that has to work in any type of situation, whether selling, buying, coming to terms, etc. that has to work a deal with another party will greatly benefit from a through reading of this work.

I'm glad that I read this book first.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that is considering an entry into trading, whether or not you plan on investing long term, short term, swing or day trading you'll gain some valuable information here.  I think the most important point the author makes in the book is that trading or investing is often a game of the mind.  The mind of the individual trader.  It's you against you.<br />Then it's you against the other guy.<br />It's so obvious, but often forgotten, that when someone is selling something someone else is buying it and visa versa.  Think about that.  Whenever one guy sells a stock, some other guy thinks he's wrong and is buying it...<br />Also interesting in this book is the history.  For any interested in a little bit of stock market history, this book coupled with a book called \\"The Screwing of the Average Man\\", will give some great insights into how much the general public is often played for a sucker.<br />Don't be a sucker, read this book and take to heart the strong advice on how not to lose.	2003-10-15

If you have even a little bit of interest in writing or editing or working in any kind of advertising, even if it is just a simple flyer for your business or nonprofit fund raiser this book will easily pay for itself.<br />I've read and reviewed a few books on writing, from Stephen King's nonfiction work on writing fiction to books on writing nonfiction.  This work stands up there with the best of them, and I'd recommend this work to writers of all types.  Joseph Sugarman explains the purpose of the headline.  It's to get the second line read.  The purpose of the second line, well, that's to get the third line read.  If fiction writers followed this formula, they'd sell more books.  I can't count how many books, both nonfiction and fiction, I put down after a short time because I just find no reason to go on.<br />But this book isn't about writing fiction or nonfiction, it's about writing great copy.  The reason I bring up other types of writing is that they all have the same strengths or weaknesses' going for them that get them read or ignored.<br />A copy writer has a short time to get the reader to either send money or request more information or act in some way.  The fiction writer has to grab the readers attention and I mean now.  See my review for Noah Lukeman's \\"The First Five Pages\\", basically he's got the same advice for fiction writers, you better grab the readers attention, and you better be flawless, because you have about the first five pages to win or lose the game.  Often less.<br />In copy writing you have the first five words.  Often less.  Same idea.<br />I highly recommend this work to writers of all types.  If you're in advertising, even if just for your own small business, you'd be foolish to pass on this one.	2003-10-15

It is very amazing how a little idea thought up by a new mom to be looking for a home based business blossomed into a giant public company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.  This book really isn't a &quot;how-to&quot; book, although it would certainly qualify as a &quot;how-to&quot; primer, enough information to get the reader thinking about how things work and developed.<br />The author was very open about some of the hardships and mistakes that were made along the way, and I found it interesting to hear someone that was ultimately very successful talk about the numerous time she almost quit or at least really wanted to quit, but some how found the courage to go on.<br />What I didn't like about the book was that she didn't give much of a voice to her husband.  The fact of the matter is that her business, by her own admission, never would have made it to where it is today if it hadn't been for his support and contribution.  This isn't something to be looked at as a negative, or anti-woman in any sense, but the truth is that in reality there was a partnership that made the business what it became, yet the book's cover and the over-all premise is that it was a &quot;self made&quot; woman story.  I think the story would have been much better told if it had alternated between both the voices.  In fact, the bottom line is that the business was a success because of the support and work of the entire family unit.  This was talked about in the book, but seemingly down played in the cover, jacket and over all scope.<br />I recommend this book to any that are interested in business success stories, men or women, it is very inspirational and it was fun to read too.	2003-10-04

Sometimes a book grabs my attention because of the overall look of the cover, the title and the graphics.  This book with it's interesting title and strong purple cover caught my eye and I had to explore further.<br />It's not a  real long book, but it is filled with some solid insight and advice.<br />I'd recommend it to any in a sales or business environment.  Self employed entrepreneurs as well as corporate managers would gain something from a reading.<br />Each chapter has a short story that makes a point about a topic and then a discussion of that topic follows.  There are quotes on the bottom of each page and several pages of quotes at the end.<br />What are some of the things I gained an insight into?<br />Time.  We all have the same amount but we don't all use it the same, an interesting look at how we deal with time.<br />Creativity.  What is the difference between being creative and simply following the crowd?  How can we &quot;steal&quot; ideas yet still be creative?<br />Learning.  This was perhaps the most important chapter.  Do we really learn to learn or do we just memorize facts and figures?  How learning, continual learning, is so important.<br />Supporters.  The people we surround ourselves with.<br />Does the idea of an &quot;honest&quot; thief sound like a contradiction?  An oxymoron?  Perhaps, but the author here makes a clear cut and compelling argument about using the foundation set by those before us to climb even higher and reach our goals.<br />A very strong recommendation.	2003-09-30

I'd going to guess I'll probably get more out of this book in a second reading some time in the future.  However, that being said, I give a strong recommendation to this book to any in a selling career.<br />There is common selling advice here, but there is also items with a twist from the authors point of view.  Every bit helps.  There is something here that would make it worth reading for almost any sales professional or manager.<br />Another great thing in this book is a long list of recommended reading.  These types of lists, when complied by someone trustworthy, are often worth there weight in gold.  I plan on checking out some of his recommendations myself.<br />There is a lot here on setting goals and planning out the future.  I am not big on &quot;filling out the forms&quot;, however I recognize the importance of what it is that he is trying to get across here.  Perhaps in my future I'll be more disciplined in this area.<br />The handling objections portion of the book is worth the price of owning it.  Remember that it only takes one tip or bit of advice for a book like this to pay off in a big way.  I give it a strong recommendation.	2003-09-30

I could define here what Peck gets across, but I'd rather just recommend the book.<br />Just this aspect of the book is worth the time and the price of admission.  If you ever wondered about love, real love between people, read it.<br />Peck does go off on some tangents.  Not all of this book is well written in the sense that it is easy to read or flows well, however, the insights gained are worth the effort.  There are a few things here that I don't agree with and I'd imagine, most likely, that over time, Peck has changed some of his early held positions.  But what he says will cause you to think.<br />Another good subject is the idea of religion. Anyone that thinks there are not religious is simply wrong and Peck makes a strong argument as to why.  Are you an atheist?  Well don't be so quick to think that means you are not religious, you may be more religious than you think.<br />There are case studies and stories and some position statements.  It is a book worth reading if not because it was a best seller for a long time when it was first published but because Peck is simply able to explain in an understandable fashion why people often need help in life and how life itself is simply hard.<br />&quot;Life is difficult&quot; is how the book starts.  It is a strong recommendation from me.  Life is about loss.  See my review of &quot;My Losing Season&quot; by Pat Conroy, another master of reading into the heart and soul of man, for another good book dealing with the difficulties and trials of life.	2003-09-30

If you are in management, get this book.  If you have to go and buy a car, and you want to be able to hold your ground on the buyers side of the table, buy this book.<br />There is plenty of common sense here, some of the techniques will be old hat to some, but there is always something to learn or get better at, so for those that work in a business environment especially a selling position, this is a good book to go through and sharpen your skills with.<br />The first  part of the book gives examples and definitions.  It explains what the authors find as good negotiating and bad negotiating.  There are tips ranging from understanding body language to understanding clues given by the other party, tips about questions and tips about location, information, using third parties, working in groups or alone and many other topics.<br />The second part of the book has the &quot;101 ways to win every time&quot;.  Basically it involves giving a brief description of a type of negotiating, a skill or technique, and the counter to this technique if it is used on you.  They take about a page and are quick reading.<br />This is definitely a book worth owning and reviewing from time to time.	2003-09-30

Doing is vastly more important, talent always taking second fiddle to persistence and action.  However, it is always good to increase knowledge and this book gives some simple information that should strike most readers as obvious.  If only knowledge lead more easily to action.<br />There are probably better books on the market that deal with how to obtain and keep wealth, however, this one lays out the simple formulas that lead to becoming a millionaire and how  too many us ignore them.  It is not a &quot;how to book&quot; so much as it is a &quot;this is how it is&quot; book.<br />I highly recommend this work.  It is especially encouraging to those that perhaps had a tough start in life or had little or no higher education.  I also recommend other works by this author to those in that work in a selling environment or are considering a career in that field.	2003-09-29

I enjoy DeMille's works a lot more than I do the several mystery books I've reviewed by women authors.  Perhaps it is a point of view thing.<br /> 'Plum Island' wasn't as good as &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; and &quot;Up Country&quot; in my opinion, but it is a very good mystery and very well written.  Are men just better writers for men and women just better for women?  Or is DeMille just a master and some of the others I've read just plain good?  I don't know, but I know that I can't get enough of this guy's writing, and I've been sharing his paperbacks with my mother, who burns through them as well.<br />If I have any complaints about this book, and where I found it fell short of being as good as the others, is that the ending had a little too much violence.  I don't mean this in the way of description, I just found the antagonist's actions to be too much over the edge.  He wasn't developed enough as a character for me to believe he'd act as he did.  However, the skill at with which DeMille handles the protagonist is enough to keep this book at a &quot;5&quot; and it still comes with a strong recommendation.<br />If you enjoy mysteries, cop/detective novels and suspense, this book will not disappoint.	2003-09-29

He is a master and this one is no exception, however it is a different type of book than what I expected, perhaps because I started with 'The Gold Coast'.<br />I had seen the movie before I read this book, so I kind of had an idea what the subject matter would be, however, they are different enough that the book was still very enjoyable, in fact, I rented the movie again and didn't like it as much.<br />&quot;The General's Daughter&quot; is well written and the lead character is instantly likable, something DeMille seems to be very talented at because in this and other books I've read, I've noticed that I get into the protagonist's head almost from page one.  DeMille himself must be a real character, I can't imagine that he makes his lead characters totally out of thin air, they are too believable.<br />This book is a great murder mystery and suspense novel, but it is also just a great novel because it gets the reader into the mind of the character so well.  I highly recommend this work to anyone that enjoys mysteries, suspense, or military fiction.	2003-09-29

It is mostly common sense.<br />There are simply too many good books out there, hundreds of them, to spend time on this much of a condensed and simple level.  Perhaps for a young adult, high school age, this would be a good book to read as a primer for sales or maybe just to see if a career in sales might be something worth considering.<br />As for myself, I skimmed through it and found nothing worth dwelling on as there was nothing here I hadn't already read else where.	2003-09-29

It contains a lot of information about Vietnam, both modern and wartime.  DeMille is simply a master writer and I can't recommend his books strong enough to any that enjoy good fiction.<br />A modern mystery, this book takes the reader to modern Vietnam to solve an old murder that happened during the war.  While it certainly isn't a history book, it contains an amazing amount of information for a fictional story so the reader is both getting an action filled story and also some lessons in history.<br />The protagonist is the same as in the book 'The General's Daughter', so I would recommend reading that one first.  I didn't read them in order, as I didn't know there was an order and it didn't hurt the story at all, but if you have the option, get the other first as it is a very good book too.  DeMille does an excellent good of getting the reader into a story right off the bat and with just enough back story to properly set the stage.  He is never ever boring, just the opposite as no matter how much is going on, I am always getting disappointed as the story is getting near it's end.  I guess it's the old &quot;always leave 'em wanting more&quot; thing...<br />If there is any compliant to this book, it is going to be that the ending is not cut and dry enough.  I didn't mind it, but my mom who also loved the book, complained that the ending didn't have enough closure.  In any case, I give it a very strong recommendation.

I could describe the basic plot, the type of story it is; or just say \\"Hey, this is a great book!\\", however, you can read that in the editorial reviews so I won't bother.<br /> I can say this: Out of some 600 pages (in the paperback version I read) there are only a few places of actual intense character \\"action\\" of the \\"mystery/gangster thriller\\" type, but this was a couldn't-put-down-page-turner.  To hold a reader on the edge, interested, involved, compelled and feeling for that long, wanting to press forward while simultaneously hating the fact that the right side of the book was getting thinner and thinner, now that is the feat of a fine writer, a rare writer.<br />I wouldn't say that this book is anything like Conroy's 'Beach Music', except to say that  both authors have the ability to make the reader feel along with the characters.  Both have an almost unnatural insight into the human psyche and both books are among the finest novels I've ever read.  Where Conroy made me feel sad and  empty at times, DeMille made me laugh (occasionally out loud) and feel the same frustration with existence that  his protagonist did.  Life really is screwed up and people really do behave this way.<br />As way of another comparison, I enjoyed this novel the way I enjoyed 'Time Enough for Love' by R.A. Heinlein.  Heinlein takes the reader across thousands of years, time and different universes, what makes his work so amazingly good is his ability to capture human emotion and motives in words, sentences, paragraphs and finally chapters of a great novel.  DeMille captures the same, yes, but the setting doesn't take place outside of a few square miles and few months. I won't hazard a guess as to which was the greater feat, or which was harder to write, but I will say that both are absorbing works, the kind that get reread with enthusiasm.<br />The paperback I read had a new foreword by the author, which is well worth reading in itself.  Apparently this work has touched a lot of people over its relatively short life and I concur with those that already consider it a classic.<br />This was my first novel by this author, but I can guarantee not my last.<br />The highest recommendation and a simple \\"I owe you one\\" to the author.worth reading in itself.

Cornwell does a good job of filling in back story unobtrusively so I don't think it is problem to start randomly, however, if I had had the choice I would have started with the first book.  Her writing is slower paced than the average mystery/thriller and my own preference would have been to cut out some of the description but I keep turning page after page so I won't say I was ever bored.<br />This is definitely a series written with a woman in mind as it's target audience, however, it was a compliment by Steven King, in his nonfiction book on writing, that gave me the impetus to try a  Cornwell novel.  She keeps the story moving and her dialogue and pace are entertaining if not just a bit overdone.  I've only read one of Grafton's alphabet series and in comparison, I'd say that Cornwell goes way deeper into description, dialogue, and characterization but that they'd both appeal to the same kind of reader.<br />One of the things I think about when reading this kind of best selling popular novel is whether or not it would make a good film.  I don't believe that this book would translate well into film, too much of it is filler, description's of peoples clothes, food, medical equipment and the like.  There is action, but I never felt much danger to the main characters and the way that the killer is eventually caught smacked me as being way to coincidental, as if there really wasn't a clever enough of a way to catch him.<br />I have two other complaints, one minor and one more of a problem.  The minor one was the simple problem of an echo, an unusual word she used twice, once to describe trees being taken over by a parasitic growth and once to describe buildings taking over the country side.  The other issue was something that happens in the beginning of the book, a search dog jumps back from a car seat in obvious fright.  It was a big foreshadowing event, I thought, but was dealt with in the end with a couple of lines in a small paragraph.  Both anticlimactic and unbelievable, however I will be the first to admit I am a bit picky.<br />I would recommend this work to any that like mystery thrillers, but would suggest getting the first book and starting there.<br />I am also torn when it comes to rating.  It is probably better than average in it's field, however I don't believe it's a strong 4 or a 5, but being as 3 stars just means average, I'll give it a 4.as dealt with in the end with a couple of lines in a small paragraph.

Like many popular novels, this one is an easy and fairly quick read despite the fact that Cornwell often gives way too much detail and information in places.  Near the beginning of this work she introduces a manager at a local motel that has red hair and a cat named &quot;Pickles&quot;.  She tells us why the cat is named Pickles, and if I could ask her, I'd wonder why she bothered.  Somebody apparently likes Vidalia onions too, so what?  I think some of the attention to detail, like what's for dinner and what color a meaningless characters shirt is, could have been left out.<br />Cornwell does a good job of back story and I was surprised to find that a character from 'All That Remains', the only other novel of hers I've read, had died off in one of the previous books.  By the end of this one, I decided that there was a plot line that Cornwell doesn't seem to escape from; Scarpetta is a bit of a loner and lots of her friends die including one in the the book I just mentioned.  I suppose it propels readers into the next book, who will die next?  But I find it too contrived.  I never liked the premise of that tv show 'Murder She Wrote' either, how many people have someone around them get murdered all the time?<br />In 'All That Remains' we have too many coincidences.  Perhaps that is often how crimes are solved, through lucky breaks and the like, but here it was too much.  And I really didn't care for the ending, it was too sudden and didn't have much suspense.  It seemed like she decided it was time to end the book, so the killers just showed up and started shooting.<br />Another complaint I have is simply that she leaves some issues unresolved.  In the beginning of the novel, there is a black foal that has mysteriously escaped death and we are lead to believe this is some kind of foreshadowing, but it never gets resolved.  Also the character that seems to be important at the beginning, the big-wig rich guy, ends up being almost meaningless, even though we are lead to believe he has some importance.<br />A huge issue in trying to solve the crime, how the fires started and how they get so big, gets tons of play, but we never get told what actually happened.  This was the biggest error of the book, I felt, there was all this drama building up about how they couldn't figure out how the fires got started and then we are never told what actually happened.  One of the problems of writing from only one viewpoint, in the first person, is that it is sometimes awkward to describe events that the protagonist doesn't know about first hand.  I'd give Cornwell an &quot;A&quot; for how she handles this technique, but to leave out something so important seems unforgivable.  She does explain how the fire starts, but it is akin to saying they &quot;used a match&quot; she left out how they got so hot when that question was a huge story point to the fire detectives.<br />And of course the characterization of Lucy was too much.  If Cornwell wants to write about a computer genius, beautiful and perfect, able to do calculations in her head that everyone else needs a calculator for, able to fly helicopters, be a fire investigator, FBI agent, and so forth, perhaps she should make her the protagonist as she is almost like a female James Bond and she shouldn't be playing second fiddle.<br />Despite my complaints, being picky and looking for faults is a character trait of mine, I'm still going to give this book a 4.  In the field that it is written in, it is above average.  I'd recommend, however, starting in the beginning of the series, unlike myself, as I think that would make the stories run together more smoothly.  I'd also point out that this type of writing probably appeals more to female readers, but I'd venture to say I'll read more, they are certainly entertaining.to believe he has some importance. <br />A huge issue in trying to solve the crime, how the fires started and how they get so big, gets tons of play, but we never get told what actually happened.

I will admit that some of the reading is a bit laborious, and unlike most books, I found that if I didn't use a book mark I'd get easily lost.<br />This book is about technique, as the title states, and that is what is to be found here.  It doesn't have instructions one how to write a &quot;block buster, best selling novel&quot; nor does it describe in much detail about whether to use the &quot;outline everything&quot; model or the just do it approach, although Mr. Swain does have opinions about these topics and a host of others.<br />The techniques described here can and should be used to write for any genre and almost any type of writer could benefit from a good reading of this work.  There is a reason this book is still being printed and is still popular after being first released some 38 years ago.  And there is hardly anything out of date, sans a few mentions of typewriters and carbons, this book could have been written last year.<br />Because of it's length and because it is a bit hard to read in some places, I'd suggest that someone looking for a good book on writing for the first time start with something a bit less challenging and shorter, then, if interest is still high, come to this and learn in more detail and with more specifics the techniques presented.  I have reviewed some other good books on writing, some of which are shorter and easier to read, but still very good.<br />I do highly recommend this work, in the middle of reading it, I took a short break and read a fast paced paperback fictional novel by a very successful writer and noticed all kinds of techniques that I had previously simply read without realizing the important function they were playing in making a successful novel.	2003-07-31

The story involves a troubled young man who hates seeing nature harmed and how he goes about trying to teach certain violators a lesson.  There are dirty politicians, corrupt developers, hookers, hit men and plenty of action.<br />The story moves quickly and doesn't have any dull spots, making it the perfect book for airplane trips or waiting rooms.  It touches serious topics, true, but does so with wit and sarcasm and leaves no side pure, although I'd guess the writer to be a liberal as some of his viewpoints seem to bleed into the story, whether on purpose or not I cannot say as this is the first work of his I have read.<br />All in all, I recommend this book and look forward to reading some of his others.	2003-07-30

Perhaps the most interesting tidbit was the telling of a bit of advice from a friend in the publishing business.  He relates that most of the time he can tell if a book is worth anything in the first 3 pages, certainly by the first 10.  Sounds like another book I reviewed (positively)  \\"The First Five Pages\\" by Lukeman.<br />The two authors in \\"Writing Young Adult Novels\\" had previously published some of their own work, so they had some experience in which to back up their advice.  They also relied on a lot of quotes or small passages from popular YA books that were successful and I found that information very helpful.<br />This book was a fairly light and quick read, and the few hours I spent I considered worth my time.  I quickly glossed over the few sections that gave general \\"how to advice\\" and laughed at few times they mentioned the problem of looking at a blank white sheet of paper in the typewriter.  I can't recall the last time I actually saw a typewriter, and I am quite sure that my two year old will never touch one, however the general advice on how get started, how to proceed and how to finish was all in line with what I have read in more recent books on writing.<br />For writing in general, I would skip this book and look at some of the more popular offerings (several of which I have reviewed), however, if you have an interest in this field I would recommend reading this book, it is well written, reads quickly and has sound advice.	2003-07-21

I will reiterate a common compliant, it is a bit too long because some  items are rehashed.  It doesn't take into account (or give enough value to) some things, culture and religion being among them, and there seems to be some items that are missing and some contradictory.<br />That being said, I really did enjoy reading this book, it is for the most part well written and well thought out and it tackles a very big and compelling question.  I will state my beliefs here, only because they provide a lens for me, and that lens colors how I see the world.  I am a believing Christian, one that takes for granted that God created the world, not necessarily as it is, but as it once was.  I state that because, upon reflection, I think of Mark Twains' 'Letter's From Earth', and the bit there where he chastises God for creating such wonders as the tsetse fly and ring worm.<br />I think that Diamonds explanation of how some dreadful diseases jumped from animal to man,  either because of ignorance in husbandry practices, lack of cleanliness or by sexual contact explains how perhaps there can be harmony in the belief that God did create a good world, but that over time it was indeed corrupted.<br />I also bring up the subject of my beliefs to simply say that is is a very scholarly work and well received by myself, even though, it seems, my beliefs may be at odds with any researcher or writer that places belief in evolution and natural systems as the only answer to questions that we all have inside.<br />I found the discussion in this book where it relates to  animals, mammals in particular, to be very interesting.  I never before had reflected upon the fact that even though zebras seem to be much like a horse, the fact that they  cannot be domesticated and  humans were well into modern history before parts of Africa saw a horse had a huge impact upon history.<br />Having lived in Hawaii, I knew that the introduction of disease wiped out vast numbers of natives after the arrival of Europeans, but Diamond explains in detail how and why these diseases cultivated themselves in human populations and why the natives all over the New World were totally unprepared for the arrival of them.<br />There is a big deal of writing on the axis of continents and how that had a huge effect upon the development of cities and large populations.  Diamond perhaps goes over this part of his theory too much, and may put too much emphasis upon it, but the study of the effects that it had upon crops and the jump from hunter gathers to tribes to cities  still makes a good and interesting read even if a bit labored.<br />All said and done, this is a good book.  It is highly readable, which for a science/history/text book type of work is a very good thing.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in it's driving question, \\"why did some people (in the world) end up with all the cargo?\\".at the introduction of disease wiped out vast numbers of natives after the arrival of Europeans, but Diamond explains in detail how and why these diseases cultivated themselves in human populations and why the natives all over the New World were totally unprepared for the arrival of them.<br />There is a big deal of writing on the axis of continents and how that had a huge effect upon the development of cities and large populations.

A publisher read that article and asked her to develop the idea into a book.  That it became a book, and later into a 4 hour television series, is testament to how fascinating a topic this is.  I enjoyed this book a lot, I like history and the people that have been gifted enough to change it.<br />The reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it doesn't read with the smoothness of a novel and it doesn't have enough of a &quot;story teller&quot; quality.  I found I had the same problem in reading Tuchman's &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot;, the information is great and fascinating and powerful, but I want a story, or else I feel like I am in school again and history becomes too chore like.  The story  in &quot;Longitude&quot; is there, it is just missing some quality, one I can't quite identify, but that I sense is missing.<br />That being said, if you are a reader that enjoys history and the people behind  important inventions and discoveries, this book will appeal to you.  It has some of the same problems I felt the book &quot;Flu&quot; (written by a journalist) has. Being written by someone at the outset as something other than a book, it lacks something that a strong novel has, and even though this is a true account, history can be told in a novel like way, as in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;.<br />I do recommend this book to anyone  interested in  invention, maritime history and  similar.  It is a very fascinating topic.	2003-01-28

I will freely admit that I am often a lazy reader, but it isn't that I have never made it through a long book before.  My problem, it seems to me, is that Tuchman keeps this book totally accurate, without fail it seems.  There are tidbits and facts and dates and quotes.  There seems to be little, if any, conjecture, and perhaps that is as it should be, but as a casual reader, fascinated by the time period, I couldn't bring myself to work hard enough to continue through to the end.<br />I was glued to the page when she tackles the subject of \\"Youth and Chivalry\\" and found the explanation of how marriages of the time were arranged and how infidelity was justified to be my favorite part of what I read.  It seems that with marriage coming at such a young age and being arranged by others, that to have a relationship with one's \\"true love\\" it must by definition come outside the scope of one's marriage, which was an establishment set up for the duty of family and the production of heirs.  The place children fit into the society of the time was another facet I found very intriguing.<br />This book, of course, covers Black Death, Kings, Popes, wars and battles and all kinds of foreign entanglements  There is probably some topic here that would interest any reader that wants to delve into the period.  For this reason I do recommend this book for those that are so compelled, but I do so with the caveat that it is not easy or light reading.	2003-01-28

The story of Mel Fisher was so compelling to me, all I needed, I told my dad, was a few million dollars to get started and some good maps.<br />He laughed and teased me, then, upon a return trip from Florida, he brought me this book, and old \\"treasure\\" map and some fake \\"tourist\\" treasure all to get me started.<br />I was completely fascinated by the accounts in this book.  It is a couple of hundred pages long and each of the eleven chapters covers a different treasure.  The book covers the history behind the treasure as well as accounts of people trying to find the various hoards hidden, it seems, forever.  Or perhaps the treasure was never left behind in the first place, but the idea that \\"some\\" of it may still be there is enough to make any treasure hunter feel a bit driven to want to go and see for themselves.<br />This book is history and story, it is not in any way a guide to go looking for treasure nor do the authors give encouragement to the reader that if they are lucky and resourceful they might make history themselves.  But for anyone interested in the history of some great pirate stories and modern accounts of treasure hunting, or for dreamers like myself, I  recommend this book.  It is fun and well written.	2003-01-28

I enjoy science fiction and time travel stories so I assumed that if a book is worth collecting, it must be worth reading.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the accounts of the time period, as seen by the hero of the book, and the intrigue he gets caught up in (and how it ties to his modern day girlfriend) and they pushed me through the book as a good story should, yet I was getting a bit of a history lesson at the same time.<br />I will say that as far as science fiction stories go, this isn't the greatest as the science part of the story is a bit weak and if taken away we'd still be left with a period mystery.  But knowing the story is being told by the modern onlooker makes it a better story and the situations that he finds himself in because of the time shifts increase the tension.<br />Anyone enjoying this book because of the time period and setting (end of the nineteenth  century New York) might also find the mystery/detective period novels by Caleb Carr to be good reads as well.  I also found those, by coincidence, from the same source.<br />I give a good recommendation for &quot;Time and Again' to any enjoying a good period mystery with the added benefit of time travel thrown in the mix.	2003-01-28

It is very informative and was well researched, there are lots of footnotes at the end.  Much of the chapters read as separate articles that could stand independently.  What it is not is a novel like read similar to the story that appears in Hot Zone.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning about the 1918 flu and about the modern researchers trying to find clues to what made that flu so deadly.  If you are interested in knowing about that topic then I give this book a strong recommendation.  If you are looking for a novel type page turner you'll probably be disappointed.<br />There was one situation that made the whole work worth reading to me, maybe because I have a weird sense of humor.  That was the telling of two separate research expeditions into the frozen north to dig up bodies of people that had died of the 1918 flu.  One team was filled with experts, used x-ray to search, spent years planning, spent tons of money, had tons of media present.  Didn't get results, the bodies were too decomposed.<br />The other expedition was one guy with a pick.  Well actually he got a few villagers to help him dig, but he spent only a few thousand of his own money and got results, real helpful results, in a couple of weeks.<br />I also found the detailing of a flu scare that happened in Hong Kong with a jump from chickens to humans a very interesting story.  How that scare and the research that went into studying it and comparing that to the 1918 ordeal was fascinating.<br />There is a bit of information here about the politics of the Swine Flu panic in the 1970's and how the Ford administration dealt with it.  Some of the same kinds of questions and issues are relevant today with all the threats of toxic warfare.<br />If you find the topic of the 1918 flu interesting and how it relates to modern day problems and solutions this book is a strong recommendation.	2003-01-18

I wasn't interested in reading King in the past because I once picked up \\"Cujo\\" and happened to turn to a page that was filled with gross descriptions of violence.<br />But since I enjoyed  the movie adaptation of this book as well as several others King has written, I thought it was time to put aside my previous concerns and read one of his novels.  I guess if your looking for horror, blood, and the supernatural this book probably won't be as enjoyable as you'd hoped, but it is an engaging story and the main character is likable.  I was rooting for Dolores almost from the start.<br />I doubt many King fans would need to bother reading a review like this, so if you got this far and are wondering if you should give one of his books a try for the first time, I recommend this novel as a good place to start.	2002-12-30

The premise that this author brings to the table is fascinating and well worth reading about.  In it self it deserves a 5 star rating, however, I did have a problem with the way the book was put together and the editing that went (or didn't) go into it.<br />It was this problem that caused me to lose interest and put it down somewhere in the middle.  I have a many books in this state, and it is my experience that I seldom get around to finishing them.  I felt compelled however to write a review as I don't feel it is necessarily good for the system to only write about books that we loved.<br />The idea that God revealed Himself (or better is currently and always revealing Himself) to all peoples on the earth should not be that controversial.  I imagine it is to some because they have the fault of being a bit arrogant.  It is not hard, after all, to go to some small little country church in the middle of Ohio and find a group of people that feel they are the only ones going to heaven.<br />Mark Twain once made the statement (I'll paraphrase) that the some have reduced the number of the elect to such a small group they are hardly worth saving.  It is important, I think, to reflect on what this skeptic had to say and how it relates to the general idea behind this book.  It doesn't seem reasonable to think that God would make it impossible to most of mankind to relate to Him.  And it doesn't seem reasonable to think that some small group in Ohio is the only group special enough to understand the revelation of God Almighty.<br />Of course I am not saying by any means that there is (in my belief) any way to heaven besides through Christ, or that this book purports to say that there is either, but that the way to Christ is not always through an American church service or a Billy Graham crusade.  Perhaps God had the fore sight to reveal Himself to other cultures and they used different names (ie their own language) to call God God.<br />I would recommend this book to those going to other cultures and to those that need to study on the subject.  I am hesitant to recommend it however to those that like smooth flowing easy to read text.  The stories are a bit hard to follow, there are too many names and places thrown in too quickly and much of the information comes in a text book style.oing to other cultures and to those that need to study on the subject.

If only it was that easy.<br />Henri Nouwen used his experiences and feelings surrounding the Rembrandt painting &quot;Return of the Prodigal Son&quot; coupled with time as the father at a group home for the severely handicapped as a back drop for this book.  But it is not a book that is about his time at the home, nor it is a book that really reflects that he is a catholic priest.  It has a universal message and is based squarely on scripture revolving around the story of the prodigal as well as insights gained from Rembrandt's painting<br />The pleasant yet challenging surprise of the book is how Nouwen takes the logical path from rebellious son through older brother and landing finally at the role of father and how the Father Himself calls us to become as He is.  It is the first time I have read or heard a teaching that moves from the unrelenting love that the father has for the son in the story to the idea that God is calling us not just to accept His love as the younger son does once he realizes how lost he had become, but how God is calling us to become like Him and love the rebellious and lost as He does.<br />I found it very interesting how Nouwen see parts of Rembrandt's work as being reflections of or symbols of something great and true.  These insights made the book more interesting than just a simple bible lesson on an old and familiar story.<br />Whether you find yourself in a foreign land or just outside the Fathers House,  or whether you tend to feel a bit resentful that you're &quot;following all the rules&quot; and yet things just don't seem quite right this book has something important and powerful to say to you.  If you are a leader in the church and want to be compelled to try a little harder and move a little closer to being the accepting and loving father that God calls you to be; this book has something for you.<br />I enjoyed reading this and  can highly recommend it.reading this and  can highly recommend it.	2002-12-27
US	51062124	R3HJMN35ZAY390	1400046610	957571830	Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right	Books	5	14	22	N	Y	Smart woman writes smart book	I just finished my second reading through this book and I must say I'd love to sit down and actually talk with Ann Coulter, her wit and sense of humor are only shadowed by her ability to faithfully articulate logic in a debate.  She tears down walls of liberal arguments and asides and exposes the torrid of lies and slander that liberal celebrities and liberal journalists have been perpetrating on the American public for years.<br />Any criticism channeled at this book that doesn't give multiple and specific examples explained in a coherent fashion is most likely from a liberal that hasn't read it but feels that they \\"know\\" it must be bad.  When it was first published most of the low ratings were simply from people calling Ann Coulter names (many of those reviews were eventually removed).<br /><br />Coulter points out that this is how liberals debate, not just here reviewing books, but in the news, in magazines, on tv variety shows, etc., they call those they disagree with names.  They impute all types of horrors on  those they disagree with and provide the evidence by calling them \\"stupid\\", \\"dumb\\", \\"hate filled\\", \\"homophobes\\", \\"racists\\", or the worse of all \\"right wing Christian\\" a name which implies all the previous bromidic epithets rolled into one.<br />She points out that all serious new ideas in the last fifty some years have come from the conservative side of the aisle.  Conservatives debate each other with actual ideas.  They don't always agree but at least they don't have to spin their wheels fighting nonsensical charges and trying to defend their character against lies from the left.  It takes a Tom Dashel to accuse Rush Limbaugh of inciting terrorist acts, but it takes conservative leaders to actually do something to fight terrorism.<br />The most important chapter chronicled how liberals attack of the \\"Religious Right\\".  How the left has build itself a straw man to knock down again and again.  She chronicles how the left builds up this amazing force that is so powerful and dangerous.  And then notes how every few years the media will report how this same force is losing its power and grip.  I found it enlightening to read her description of how the left sees this great vast conspiracy they so fear (and expect the public to fear) contrasted with  reality.<br />There is no organizational unit which can be called the \\"Right Wing\\".  There is no group to which any Christian can get a card to and thus be called a \\"card carrying member\\" of the \\"Religious Right\\".  In fact the very idea that Christians vote in bloc is shown by the data to be seriously flawed, blacks, hispanics, Jews, etc. voted in bloc to a much higher degree than do those that call themselves Christian.  Coulter shows the amounts of money donated in a particular year to PACs and it is clear that unions, lawyers and other special interest groups give far more money than any religious group does.  And funny thing, there is no donation going to the RNC from \\"The Religious Right Inc\\".<br />I think my main compliant about this book is that the chapter on religion needs to be devoted to an entire book.  Coulter mentions in a few paragraphs about how the left has become a religion of its own and gives this as one of the reasons it fights so hard against conservatives, especially Christians.  I hope this subject can become the next book project she writes about.  The Atheist Left votes as a bloc but it isn't likely to be written about in the mainstream press.<br />Much of the doctrine of the left is exposed in Slander.  Some things may very well be debatable, but with all the footnotes and documentation it is hard to argue that she is out in left field just making this stuff up.  I found this book to be very readable (the second time around was still enjoyable) it is filled with footnotes, quotes and lots of examples.<br />I give this book a strong recommendation.  Ann Coulter is funny, witty, smart and strong. And she tells it like it is.  The kind of woman that feminists can't help but hate.feminists can't help but hate.	2002-12-02

The concept is very interesting.<br /> I have read a bunch of books on writing recently and this work is a good example of what not to do.<br />I think I got to about page 30 before it was just too painful and I had to put it down.<br />Characters are introduced one after another in the first few short chapters.  I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting for.  The villian appears in short order, but it takes a few pages to realize that he is the antagonist of the book.<br />We over hear his side of a phone conversation with his wife.  The monologue is horrible.  There is constant &quot;telling&quot; and very little &quot;showing&quot;.  The characters hardly do anything, it is mostly the authors explaining what is going on and why.<br />The point of view is bad, in fact, I don't think there is any point of view (other than all knowing narrator) and we track so many characters we don't know who to root for or who to feel sympathy for.<br />At least by reading the first little bit of this book I got a good lesson on what to avoid and real world examples of poor writing.  In that is the only value I found here.	2002-11-29

If it does, does that mean that &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; is on the same caliber of book?  Hardly possible.<br />Mr. Yancey himself states that he really isn't all that interested when he sees a book of previously published material because they are simply not as good as a whole book devoted to a central theme.  I have to agree that this book is far less than his other books because of that limitation, but I concur with other reviewers that this is a good book and well worth reading.<br />It is perhaps the kind of book best suited for waiting rooms, bus rides, bathroom reading and the like because each chapter is short and devoted to a concise topic.  Also note that if you were a faithful reader of his columns that you'll probably be disappointed in this book as the subject matter isn't written in great enough depth to rehash it.<br />I am not much of a magazine reader, so most of this book was new to me, but some of the chapters included basic thoughts that were expounded on in full books by Yancey.  I was able to read quickly through those parts without too much trouble and I didn't find them too much of a distraction.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone new to Philip Yancey, it's an easy place to see if you like his style and take on life, Christian living and the church.  If you enjoy this book at all the next thing on your reading list should be one of his best sellers.  I have read &quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; a couple of times and it really is a great work and &quot;What's so Amazing about Grace?&quot; should be required reading for all.	2002-11-26
US	51062124	R1NO80BWAVFWH1	0823030075	595377096	Marine Painting in Oil	Books	5	46	46	N	N	Another great set of lessons, tips and &quot;how to&quot;	This is another good book by E. John that gives a lot of straight forward advice.  He followed this book with the &quot;problems&quot; book which is also a good one.  This book has more full color plates and more pictures of refined (rather than example) work, which I prefer to look at.  Beginners probably get more value out of the sketches, however, so I wouldn't pass up either book if you are trying to learn the art of seascape painting.<br />E. John's latest book, published just a couple of years ago, is a lot more &quot;slick&quot; than these other two published back in the 70's, but most of the advice and examples are similar in all three.  For any serious seascape  painter getting all three books is beyond thinking about, even if you aren't necessarily going to work on trying to emulate his style, some of the techniques are common to most marine painting and all of the general rules on wave anatomy, how foam is created, how light is dispersed, etc. are common to any seascape.<br />While painters like Lassen, Wyland (and the many seascape artists he features), Walfrado, Tabora, Nelson, etc. may have dominated the &quot;popular&quot; art scene in the last 10-15 years in Hawaii, Japan, Florida, California and probably other spots as well, they still have a few years to paint before they approach what E. John has under his belt.  I still think his timeless and classic seascapes are among the best that have been produced.<br />Another painter that has about the same number of years under his belt is Loren Adams, who unfortunately probably won't be producing a book on painting in his life time.  E. John not only produces books with &quot;how to&quot; steps, he has released video lessons and has given (maybe still does) lessons each year during studio workshops.  Loren is managed by those that feel sharing his techniques would somehow hurt their cash flow, so he is kept under a tight leash.  It is a shame because he is perhaps the most talented marine painter alive.  Some of his work can be seen at his web site and it is useful to compare his style with that of E. John and some of the more impressionist painters.<br />I've been looking for and buying books on seascape painting for a few years as well as studying works in galleries from Carmel to Kauai and I can assure any painter that they are getting lessons from one of the best in E. John Robinson.Some of his work can be seen at his web site and it is useful to compare his style with that of E.

I had thought about reading it several times before, but I as I stated in my review of the nonfiction work &quot;My Losing Season&quot;, I was trying to space out Pat Conroy's books because I knew that I'd only get to read them once for the first time.<br />It was very interesting reading this book because even though it is a fictional story it is based on some true events (which are chronicled in &quot;My Losing Season&quot;) as well being based on the realities of many that went through the rigors and trials of a military academy.  Conroy interviewed students that graduated as well as students that didn't make  it at various military schools (Citadel, VMI, Air Force Academy, etc.) to use their shared experiences to make this work ring true even though it was a fictional story much like many of the Law and Order television episodes are based on real crimes.<br />I kept wondering how much of this story was totally made up and how much was based on real events.  In &quot;My Losing Season&quot; Conroy tells the real story of his relationship with a girl that appears in the fictional work here.  He changed a lot of the details, but the core truth of how badly she hurt him rings true in both the fictional story here and the actual account of the real events.  It made me wonder what other stuff was nearly real in this fictional book...<br />Mr. Conroy talks about how his alma mater wouldn't let him back on campus for many years after this book was published.  It hit a cord which reverberated for a long time and I'll take that as a clue that this work, much like &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; and &quot;Beach Music&quot; were thinly veiled truths, pieces of art that are much to mirror like for comfort.<br />One downside to reading Conroy in general is the depression that always seems to hit me.  I must fight my own demons that get stirred up as I turn the pages reading about his.  But despite the scabs that get picked and the wounds that hurt over again, I like reading what he has to say because it's real.  Real and true are funny ways to describe fiction but when must of us go day to day hiding and playing games perhaps it is enlightening to go ahead and pretend that what is real, is not, and what is not; is.<br />If you have not yet read Pat Conroy, this is as good a place to start as any.  This work is not as heavy duty as &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; and &quot;Beach Music&quot; and I'd imagine would probably appeal to a wider audience.  Once you've read this I'd wager that you'll be anxious to get your hands on &quot;My Losing Season&quot;.  Enjoy.g about his.

I enjoy non fiction and have lately devoted most of my reading to it, but I wasn't sure what I was going to be getting when I read the description of &quot;My Losing Season&quot;.  After all, who cares about an unknown college basketball team that played in the sixties?<br />I haven't read all of Mr. Conroy's books yet, not because I don't think he is one of the great writers of all time, but because I know that I'll only get to read them once for the first time.  My introduction into his worlds of fiction caught me by surprise because I was well into 'The Prince of Tides' before I realized that the book wasn't a true story.  I now realize after reading 'My Losing Season' that everything he writes is true, even the fiction.<br />I would have broken down crying several times during the reading of this book, but my heart is still guarded by never sleeping sentinels whose tireless detail is to walk the stone walls that guard my interior.  Mr. Conroy manages to gain an entrance, however, and at times during reading his work I feel a sense of hatred towards him.  Not meanness, just anger with no where to go.<br />So what is it about this book, this story that makes it so worth reading?  The nakedness that Pat Conroy brings to the page.  The truth.  Simple and raw and courageous.  Enduring and joyful, sad and painful.<br />I envy his memories, his legacy, his past, not because  I feel that the journey was easy or he was lucky, but because whatever molded him into the man he became, whatever blessing or curse that was bestowed him at birth, whatever angels or demons followed his path, he has been able to live outside of the shells and caves and fortresses that most of us dwell in.  Or at least he has done so enough to make a difference.<br />While I can't recommend 'My Losing Season' enough, I do have one slight reservation, that being I don't know whether or not a first time reader will enjoy it more before or after they've read one of his previous books.  But do read it, whether or not you are familiar with basketball, military colleges or the journey of broken boys trying to become men, you will turn the last page wishing there was more.  I promise.ill enjoy it more before or after they've read one of his previous books.

I mention this because much of this book reads as if the author was writing a fictional story about prison, yet was doing a poor job of it.  The fact that it is a personal memoir and meant to be a true account of the struggles of the author makes it a fascinating read and I'll admit that I was able to tune out the outside world for a few reading sessions over a couple a days as I burned through the pages.<br />What made some of the reading difficult was keeping up with all the names and events and the general time line.  It got confusing at times.<br />But the actions of people that interacted with the author were clear enough to present an engaging story, and anyone that is interested in the world of prisons and criminals doing hard time during the period of the book will find this work interesting.  Most of the hard core story telling happens from the mid sixties through the seventies and into the eighties.  There is stuff going on in the nineties here but the story starts to lose some of its steam.<br />As for the politics of the story and the expose' of the corruption, if the author is to be believed, and I think he presented a very strong case (although alternative arguments are not really here) then the conclusion can be clearly drawn; there is and has been a lot of corruption in the Louisiana prison system.  As for my personal feelings after my reading I think that I mostly chose to believe what the author has to say, the prison system is filled with corruption and the justice system is filled with unfairness.<br />That being said, although I agree that the author is a \\"changed man\\", I didn't change my opinion of the death penalty after reading his story.  While I don't think he needs to be singled out for special punishment now, I think that the first unfairness was that he didn't receive the death penalty shortly after conviction.  Using a gun while committing a felony should carry the death penalty.  Life is precious and valuable and we show complete disrespect to the victims of violent crime when we as a people fail to administer fair and impartial justice.<br />The author complains that many murderers have been released while he was passed over for parole.  And I agree that there is an injustice here, but it isn't to him, it is to the victims and the victims families of those predators being released.  Life in prison should mean life and the death penalty should mean the death penalty.<br />All in all I recommend this book to anyone interested in a story about prison life and the struggle of one man that was sent to prison yet still found a way to bring something redeeming to this world.  I was disappointed that even though he grew up, matured, came into a realization that he had devastated many lives by killing someone that was loved and found a way to stand up to prison injustices he doesn't mention any help from God or at least a \\"higher power\\".  It seems that he healed and cured himself.  If this is not true than the book left out some important details.  I am not saying he should have made something up, of course, but if his redemption was \\"self willed\\" than reading about it has little value as the vast majority of us simply aren't that great.<br />In either case the book is an entertaining and compelling story and I wasn't disappointed in the time I spent reading it.Using a gun while committing a felony should carry the death penalty.

The two lists on how to spot a good sub or a bad sub  easily make  this book worth buying.<br />There are good overviews of  the complete process of building a home and  point the prospective owner builder in the right direction.  This book is not an end all be all of the building process,  however, it is only a guide.  Get more information on each subject.<br />I had a few problems/disagreements with some of the material such as the following:<br />He mentions vinyl/lino as a good kitchen/bath flooring choice.  While he does mention in his section regarding final walk through that vinyl is easy to rip so make sure you check this, he never mentions what a good choice (and probably cheaper in the long run) it would be to just install tile or stone instead.<br />In scheduling and planning a job he gives the approximate days it takes to do each trade or process.  While he mentions that this time table is based on perfect conditions and full professional crews I feel he does a disservice to the reader because nobody reading this book and considering doing an owner builder project is going to come close to having perfect conditions and full scale professional crews doing the kind of \\"track\\" or \\"production\\" work that the author has spent many years working as a super.<br />The person planning on using this book for its intended purpose isn't building a track or production home.  They aren't in the business of building homes (presumably) and they aren't going to get the same response from sub contractors that a general with lots of business will.  I think he'd have done the reader a better service by describing how long it is going to take, how many unforeseen problems are going to come up and that the person(s) thinking that they are going to move in during March might want to be very certain that they have alternative summer accommodations.<br />Things always go wrong in building something.  Always.<br />He mentions using flat paint on walls and semi-gloss on doors/trims.  What?  I think what he meant to say was talk to a professional painter unless you really know what you're doing.  Flat paint on walls will look like crap in weeks, unless of course you don't have kids, pets or anyone that ever puts their hands on walls.  I only mention this because such bad advice on such a simple topic makes me wonder what other information he gives that is erroneous on subjects I don't know much about and therefore would really need to rely on the advice of others.<br />He mentions that scheduling subs to work concurrently is rarely done.  What?  Not where I live and work.  While it's true that you don't want to schedule a job like a recent one I was on where we were getting our final electrical inspection yet the dry waller was still taping, the painter still painting and the carpet layer started installing carpet.  It was a commercial job, yes,  but it is not uncommon to be on the job with other trades during regular old residential work.  Sometimes it is good.  If you don't have some overlap of trades you run the risk of having to call the plumber back because he ran some pipes where a light needed to go.  It is not good to have every mechanical trade show up on a Monday, but it doesn't hurt to have the  electrician start before the plumber is totally done with rough.  Often they'll know each other and if they are true professionals they'll help each other out and give you a better job.<br />While I do recommend reading this book, it is worth the money and time, I also strongly recommend either reading other books on building as well as consulting with at least one seasoned construction pro that is familiar with your region.  Even if you have to hire a contractor has a consultant, perhaps a day or two a month, it will be money wellspent.<br />Everything and anything can go wrong in construction.  If you think it will take a week it'll take two.  If you think it will cost a dollar it'll cost three.  Beware of anything that sounds too good or too easy or too quick or too cheap.<br />That being said, I'll say this: work with professionals and you'll get professional work even if you don't know thing one about construction management but if you work with anyone that is less than a real pro, you'll pay twice in the long run.<br />This is a very good book to read before you get too involved in your building process.  He gives some great ways to plan on paper what it is you are trying to achieve in a house.  Following his advice will make you look better when you first start to talk to designers or architects and will probably make the job of getting plans ready a smoother process.<br />All in all I recommend this book, read it and then plan, plan, plan.l spent.<br />Everything and anything can go wrong in construction.

You must have a premise.  Write character bios.  Complete a step sheet.  Know where you are going.  The key to writing a salable novel is too write a certain amount every day following the guide lines and rules.  Follow them and you will succeed.  For a writer that is going to follow this route I'd also recommend the book \\"Writing the Blockbuster Novel\\" as it gives some great examples of structuring a big novel.  It also gives examples of an actual outline used in a Follet novel, which I thought was very informative.  I recommend both of these books.<br />Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" tells some of his life story and also tells how he writes his books.  He describes  writing a fictional novel  as being like a palentologist digging up bones; the story is already there, it exists in total and the writers job is to dig it up without destroying all the fragile and delicate pieces.  King doesn't mention in his book on writing anything about a premise, a step sheet, writing character bios or even knowing the outcome of the story.  He mentions that in the writing of \\"The Green Mile\\" he didn't even know if the central character John Coffey was going to live or die.  One might just say that he is a genius so the rules don't apply.  Perhaps.<br />Another good book that seems to be in conflict to Frey's work is \\"Immediate Fiction\\".  In this book we are told to start writing.  Write.  Write.  Write.  Ok, I get it.  Write something.<br /><br />I think that a melding of the two approaches could probably work very well.  Write as much as you can with the basic idea that you have.  Write a lot.  Then look at the work as if you were following one of the more structured techniques.  Does it work?  Did you break the rules or seem to follow them instinctively?<br />I am going to strongly suggest that the beginning writer like myself read a few different types of writing books.  I read various reviews and ordered a bunch of books based on what books received some decent reviews.  Some of those are listed here.  I would also recommend staying away from the more dry, teacher sounding type books, at least at first.  There are harder to read, not as fun and don't really say anything different from the others.<br />How to Write a Damn Good Novel has received lots of good comments, and I concur, it is a very good book and highly recommend.Write.

The tone is more familiar and casual than some of the other more \\"scholarly\\" sounding books I've read, which isn't to say it is not serious just more reader friendly.<br />I recently wrote a review for Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" which is also a great book on the craft and includes some personal history.  That book made me feel as if I was hearing from an old friend.  I noted in that review that \\"First Five...\\" made me feel as if I was hearing from a friend.<br />The difference I think was the personal touch in the former, lacking in \\"The First Five Pages\\" but not altogether absent.  I'd like to see a revision with more personal anecdotes or at least more stories similar to the ones Lukeman uses to open some of his chapters.  It is interesting to hear an insiders view of back room deals or books that were once rejected but later won acclaim.  It makes the learning part easier because it adds an element of enjoyment.<br />There is plenty of information here to help the aspiring writer the format is simple: the first thing that gets a work rejected is \\"A\\", the second thing is \\"B\\", etc.  To get published a writer must eliminate \\"A\\", then eliminate \\"B\\", etc.  While it is true that the actual order of items is subjective, I am sure it is close enough and besides if something is wrong it needs to be fixed regardless of it's relative importance.<br />There are lots of examples of bad text.  I quickly skimmed these in my second reading as they are so blatantly bad.  One improvement I'd suggest in a revision would be to use more real and true to life examples.  It is bordering condescension to be told that writing something like this has problems with it:<br />\\"Let me get your eggs\\" said Mary.<br />\\"Ok\\" said John.<br />\\"Do you like salt with them?\\" asked Mary.<br />\\"Not today\\" replied John, \\"Maybe tomorrow\\".<br />Eggs are so good.  You could eat them everyday.  I bet you eat eggs.<br />White.<br />Yellow.<br />Dipping toast.<br />Yummy.<br />That was the day Mary beat John to death with a dictionary.<br />I can see this myself easy enough.  What I'd really prefer is to see actual examples of that was either published or at least sent to an agent or publisher in an otherwise decent book.<br />One other slight (at least for me) problem was the end of chapter exercises.  While I realize these weren't on the order of: \\"Take a blind man, his dog and a long board and incorporate them into a story involving a blizzard.\\" I still found them to just get in the way of my reading.<br />Perhaps this quote from Swain has tainted my thinking: \\"The man who cottons to exercises generally isn't cut out to be a fiction writer.\\"  -Techniques of The Selling Writer.<br />On the whole I strongly recommend this book, it should be on the desk of every unpublished yet serious fiction writer.  I will most definitely be referring to it again., \\"Maybe tomorrow\\".<BR>Eggs are so good.  You could eat them everyday.

US	51062124	R2VCVVF6DMYSWJ	0743455967	44310359	On Writing	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	On writing and reading and living	Having never read a Stephen King book reading this one may seem an odd choice but some of my favorite movies were first King stories and his ability to tell a good story can hardly be questioned.  In the last couple months I've gone through several books on writing as I recently decided to try practicing the craft.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"The First Five Pages\\" by Lukeman and \\"How to write a Damn Good Novel\\" by Frey because it seemed that the authors weren't just explaining things like a teacher would, instead they sounded as if they were talking to a friend.<br />King does that and more in this; I felt as if he was talking to me and that we were old friends.<br />It takes a lot of skill to be able to enchant a reader,  King has that quality in the fiction genre, and for any wondering if it that quality carried over to this work of nonfiction I respond with a loud yes.<br />I recall my favorite childhood reading and the juvenile series \\"Alfred Hitchcock's The Three Investigators\\" comes to mind.  As I grew a little older I read \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" several times and also got hooked on Robert Heinlein.  I bring this up to mention that King talks about some of his early reading and how it effected him and his writing.  I would suspect that few if any good writers didn't fall in love with fiction at an early age.  He also mentions the importance of and how much he currently reads including a long list of books that he had read in the three or four previous years in an attempt to answer the question; \\"And what do you read?\\".  Other than extreme jealously, I was also feeling a bit guilty about not reading as much as I should.  I'd kill the tv if I could, he refers to it as the \\"glass teat\\" and I concur.  I'd get rid of it but I'd have to throw the wife out too...<br />There is a lot of gold here and I give it a strong recommendation.	2002-09-17

Reading about mistakes is probably best done after a writer has finished a rough draft and wants to check it see if there are any of these mistakes.<br />Some of the mistakes, several of the 38, really had nothing to do with technique or style, they addressed the act of working as a professional and presenting your work in the appropriate format.<br />Not that this is bad information, but here it is outdated and a bit simplistic.  For instance we are told not to send a manuscript to an editor that has been printed on a nine pin dot matrix printer.  A problem with not updating the book before reprinting it, it makes me wonder if there are any other bits of information that are outdated that I didn't notice.<br />I really had a problem with the constant use of the pronoun &quot;she&quot;.  As I read I don't register words like he, she, it, and, the, and the like.  When she as been substituted for he, when the pronoun refers to mankind in general and not a specific woman, it is very distracting.  I believe that it causes the exact opposite effect that the pc crowd is hoping for, instead of making women equal it takes away the fact that they had a specific pronoun &quot;she&quot;.  Where they once were treated special, now they are patronized and the reader distracted.<br />So do I recommend this work?  Maybe.  If you are reading a lot of writing books, include this one and you won't be harmed.  But if you have a budget or are just starting to delve into the various and many books on writing I would recommend starting elsewhere, &quot;How to Write a Damn Good Novel&quot; and &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; are both two good reads, they have basically the same information, but are written in a style that is less &quot;dry&quot; more current and they read quicker.	2002-08-12

Books	5	6	8	N	Y	Lots of reference material and lots of enthusiasm	While the title is a bit on the optimistic side, the information in this book is well presented and enjoyable to read.  The list of top selling nonfiction books is very useful, and can definitely stir the emotions and get the creative juices flowing, but on careful observation one can see that many of the bestsellers are not &quot;ordinary&quot; people in the normal sense of the word.  They are driven people with a will to succeed and the stamina to produce good work.<br />Many of the best sellers, Dava Sobel, Thomas Cahill, Jared Diamond come to mind because I have read their works.  These are not &quot;ordinary&quot; people they are scholars that have spent years learning subjects and coupled with the passion to write about what they know; they produce quality books.<br />But there is reference to stuff in here that perhaps anyone could write if they were willing to devote the time and research.  That is the strength of this work, that anyone willing to put in the time and effort can do something, and finding that something isn't a task to be taken lightly.  No passion for an idea will usually mean nothing special when it gets put on paper and the writer will most likely tire of the task and quit.<br />I'll have to assume that all the information about dealing with agents, publishers, specialists as well as the &quot;how to do it&quot; parts of the book are all accurate and up to date.  With this assumption, I believe this work did an excellent job presenting the nuts and bolts of how to write and submit proposals and what pit falls to avoid.  It is definitely worth the money for this information alone.<br />The section on how to write well, i.e. &quot;show don't tell&quot; was short and probably could have been left out with a list of writing books to read included in its place.  As this isn't really a book on the mechanics of writing, the small effort and samples on writing well will only serve those who haven't ever picked up 'The elements of Style'.  Perhaps the chapter was included to serve beginners.<br />The reference sections are excellent.  Who to call or write, publications to check out and examples of how a certain list can open a door to radio interviews or other great publicity.  This and the writers enthusiasm are what make this book a very strong recommendation.he chapter was included to serve beginners. <br />The reference sections are excellent.

What to Look for in Your New Home	Books	3	148	154	N	Y	Might save you from bad planning, but it leaves a lot unsaid	There is a lot of good information in this book, but there is also a lot missing as well as some misleading information.  I'd recommend this book to someone that was planning on building or remodeling with the caveat that they also read from other sources or better consult with established professionals in each and every trade on the project.<br />The strong points of this book include good discussion of doorway layouts, spacing in kitchen and baths, things to look out for that could be problems and good questions to ask or things to consider when planning.  Pointing out problems and potential problems that a homeowner may face in the future makes this book worth the money, after all, if after reading this book an owner solves or prevents just one simple mistake, the book has paid for itself many times over.<br />The weak points of this book are why I suggest reading elsewhere or consulting with professionals.  I am an electrician by trade so I read the chapter on electrical first.  It wasn't that any of the information was really bad or mistaken, but simply that I felt it didn't mention a lot of things that could and should be brought up when planning.<br />The author makes a point (several times) about having three conductor wire run to any potential ceiling fan location.  While this isn't bad advice, it's incomplete.  Many of the top of the line fans use remote control switching and don't require an extra wire.  The best fans I have installed use a remote that is battery operated and the ceiling fan itself is wired to a two conductor wire that isn't even switched.  If an owner picked up one of this fans they would now have a switch on the wall that did nothing or worse a switch that if turned off would cancel out the auto temperature function of the remote.<br />While pointing out the importance of having an extra outlet outside for things like Christmas lights, he fails to mention the nice addition of eve high outlets wired to a timer.<br />There are many reasons to consider timer switches, especially for outside wall and path lights.  The best is a 7 day 24 hour electronic timer that fits in the space of a regular switch.  These can be programed to go off at various times through out the night, a nice feature when on vacation or simply for added security.<br />The use of lighting controls, dimmers, timers, etc. is barely touched on or not discussed at all.  While these systems can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, all but very meager budgets such at least consider the options available because for some applications the extra money can be justified.<br />The use of dimming xenon lighting for undercabinet use instead of fluorescent is not discussed.  I believe it is a much better option.<br />I also noticed some problems in other trades.  The use of insta hot water heaters is mentioned as a good way to save energy in the kitchen because the hot water doesn't have to travel to get there.  I am not sure what the author was basing this information on, but it isn't correct.  First off he implies that an insta hot can supply water at the sink but he doesn't mention that there are two kinds of systems.  One is the insta hot that keeps about a gallon of near boiling water for use in making coffee, tea and instant soups and oatmeal.  While this is great for people on the go or someone that doesn't want an elderly member of the family turning on the tea kettle and perhaps forgetting it; it is not an energy saving device.  The second kind of insta hot is a small unit that doesn't store any water, it just heats up the water as it passes through the unit.  It is really only designed for one purpose only hand washing.  In the discussion on supplying extra or insta hot water for bathrooms, the author mentions that planning for the space and supplying electrical or gas are the considerations.  But what about venting the unit if it is gas?  This is a big consideration and would make adding a second unit not very cost effective.  The best solution would simply be to add a circ pump and if necessary increase the size of the water heater.  The way the information is laid out in the book would probably just confuse the non-professional.<br />The biggest problem I had in my reading of this book was when I read the author describe linoleum as the floor of choice in the kitchen.  I nearly quit reading right there and then and threw the book in the trash.  To his credit he does mention that in certain parts of the country tile is the way to go and if you live in those parts it's ok to go with tile.  I happen to live in Southern California where linoleum is the flooring used in apartments and condos and cheap o tract homes.  I can't believe anyone would recommend linoleum over tile.  Tile stands up for years and if one breaks, which is unlikely, it can be replaced with another tile.  If linoleum rips, which it's easy to do when moving appliances around, it is not as easy to fix as replacing a tile and regrouting, it will have to have a seam and seams tend to come apart after time.  Plus linoleum over the years tends to get dull with wear while tile can be cleaned and resealed, linoleum is a print on paper and once it wears out or is ripped or scratched it can't be taken back to it's pristine state.  While I personally hate the current trend in fake wood floors (laminates) because I think they look fake, I  think a compelling argument could be made to use them over linoleum.  The author of this book obviously doesn't mind linoleum, which is fine, but he fails to make a case for the other options as well as he could have and should have so that the reader could make informed choices.<br />Finally I would like to say that despite my misgivings and the problems I found, I'd like to reiterate that anyone going into building or buying a new home wouldn't be hurt by reading this book and even a simple suggestion or solution to a problem would pay for the cost of the book, but don't stop with just this book.

It is a little too basic, as well as lacking in scripture, footnotes, additional research, etc. for the advanced reader or searcher.  There are lots of &quot;examples&quot; and the advice given in the example stories are basic truths that can be applied and used either in the readers life or used by one that is helping or related to someone that suffered in their past.  I'd recommend this book as a gift to someone that you know trusts  you and could use a little nudge in the direction of getting some counseling.<br />The other point that I found could be either a plus or minus, depending on the application, is that the author decided to really downplay the role of Christ, the Holy Spirit and the Father in healing and recovery.  I know that he did this to make the book non-threatening to unbelievers and if used in that application, it is good that it isn't overbearing, but, on the other hand,  for a the believing reader, it leaves a lot unsaid.  I have heard the author speak, and I know he has a heart for Jesus, so I think he was just trying to get a good book into the mainstream that mentions that Jesus is the Way without turning a book on past pains and abuse into a book on getting saved.<br />If you find that you are still having pouts of behavior that seem unexplainable in the general context of your life, and you haven't yet sought help, perhaps giving this book a read will ring a couple of bells and send you in the right direction.	2002-03-05

Following all the acronyms and financial terms was hard enough, but the book was written too much like a text book for brokers and financial gurus.  That being said, the information in this book is of the 5 star quality and is well worth the effort of digging for if one is considering any kind of investing in the stock market, especially the high tech sectors.<br /><br />The sarcastic wit and biting humor found in the pages are a real bonus, the authors make their points and then add interesting quotes, articles or they simply point out the patently obvious (making the point that the information wasn't all that obvious to millions that lost billions of dollars in bad investments).<br /><br />Bubba Greaterfool is their name for the poor sucker that bought into the hype, didn't know what he was doing, probably never heard of the great tulip market, thought that the sky was the limit and then got stuck holding the empty bag as the hot air was expelled from the over inflated stocks that made up the tech stocks of 96-00.  My main complaint with this book is that it isn't written in a way that would appeal to or be read by the general public, Bubba especially.  And he is the guy that really needs this information.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading this to anyone that handles their own stock investments or plans too, the information is too valuable to ignore and the insight can be used to gauge other markets besides just tech stocks (remember the silver fiasco in the early eighties?)  As for casual readers I would recommending passing on this offering as it is just too much work to read, but keep it in mind if you ever consider buying that stock that just can't possibly do anything but go up...	2001-12-04

Little Dog.  My son's first word was &quot;dog&quot;.  I  loved this book when my teens were little and my little one (currently 6 ½ months) will sit through most of this book (sometimes all) when I read it to her now.  It is a great &quot;first reader&quot; as the words are common and the pictures offer help in that when one reads &quot;One big dog going in.&quot; and &quot;Two little dogs going out.&quot; the picture shows just that.  There are red, yellow and green trees, dogs &quot;over the water&quot;, dogs &quot;under the house&quot; and lots more word pictures that are fun to read and easy to learn by.  The three dogs having a party on a boat at night is just about my favorite line but I still get the most fun when it is night and the dogs are supposed to be asleep and one little one is laying in bed with his eyes wide open.  Simply put every child should have this book in their library and reading it to a child should start at a very young age.  My highest possible recommendation.	2001-12-02

She makes it through &quot;Go Dog. Go&quot;, and several others, but they aren't as long.  I am going to guess that the sound of words rhyming so well has an engaging effect even on the very young.  This book is undoubtedly a wonderful one for first readers (and it was in the collection of my two teens when they were young) but what I'd really like to impress upon the readers of this review is that this they shouldn't hesitate to give as a gift or get this book for the very young.  It is fun to read for an adult (I've been through it dozens of times) and therefore more likely to be read a lot and even little ones can hear the rhymes even if they don't know the words.

The biggest problem I have now is getting her to listen to me or look at it with out trying to chew the book, but I suspect that she'll outgrow that stage (someday!).  This story is very adorable and I think that it is comforting for a child to know that their parent(s) can and that they do love them more, after all little ones are so self centered and it is our job as good parents to help them grow out of that by showing that there is great reward in loving others more than they love us.  I think there is a great allegory here about God's love for his children too, so reading this to a child can maybe get us adults to think a little deeper about our own value.  This is a great story, a great book and should be given to and read to the very young (don't wait until they can read- start now).  A very  strong recommendation.	2001-12-02

It's fun to read with some good alliteration and rhyme.  I have read it many times to my little daughter (currently 6 ½ months) and while it isn't quite as engaging as the Tawny Scrawny Lion, it's still a strong recommendation.  Don't even give the age categories a second thought, this book should be read to and in the hands of babies and toddlers too.	2001-12-02

He does give good straight foward advice and I was able to contact their office and have articles of incorporation downloaded to my home computer.  Basically all the information is given and laid out in an easy to use format, this book is a good recommendation, but I also would recommend reading some books on tax planning, using Nevada as a tool for privacy and getting information on obtaining corporate credit as a business tool.  Another good book is 'Inc. Yourself' by McQuown, which explains the benefits more and spends less time on the form (which this book is good for).	2001-11-18

Pretty straight foward reading, my one complaint would be lots of fluff included, like pages of sample tax forms.  Is anyone really going to read that?  Maybe, but I was willing to take her at her word and couldn't figure out the forms if I wanted to.<br />One thing lacking is more specific information on the benefits (or lack of if that's her opinion) of incorporating in Nevada and how to go about it if that's the readers choice.  More information on corporate credit as a business tool would be useful as well.<br />As a companion to this book, you'll need something similar to &quot;How to Incorporate in Any State&quot; by Brown to see the actual form and function of incorporating ie forms, etc...<br />This book is a solid recommendation.	2001-11-18

While certainly just fiction, and of course, over the top in its premise, this book is a good solid science fiction novel.<br />The main character is plunged into a world of revenge when his family is killed by terrorists and he comes up with an extreme punishment for the world; a plague that kills women only.  Men are unharmed carriers of the disease.  Hey, I said it was &quot;out there&quot; in it's premise...<br />The main part of the story takes place in Ireland, where it all starts with a car bomb, with an adventurous journey taken by the &quot;most evil man in history&quot;, an under cover terrorist and a team of a priest and his young aide.  The contemplation of the characters on this journey make up a good part of the story, and Herbert does a good job on letting the reader see the different sides and thoughts of each person.<br />While best known for Dune, which is a masterpiece, Herbert writes a solid book here that bears no resemblance to the former, but certainly could be made into a good movie in it's own right.	2001-11-10

My complaint would be that Campolo is such a great speaker, one that pours out emotion and feeling, and his writing falls short of that same intensity.  I wouldn't recommend this book to someone that is advanced in their Christian reading, reading such books like 'The Divine Conspiracy', but for the less intense it is probably a good choice for &quot;How such I live?&quot; kind of reading.  I'd also recommend Yancy and Manning.<br />Campolo does a good job of putting the hard questions right out there: &quot;Are we doing what we should/want/dreamed of doing?&quot;  This would be a good book for a high school or college graduate, just to remind them that ten or twenty years can blow past and one can find oneself in a fenced in yard of regret.<br />Campolo offers a good elbow to the ribs and gives some practical advice to getting or staying on track in living ones life for Christ.	2001-11-10
US	51062124	ROMUJIKYSMP5C	0553572997	501395694	The Alienist	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Very interesting history in a fictional novel	Carr did a lot of research for this fictional mystery/detective/historical novel set in New York at the end of the 19th century and it makes the very interesting and well written serial killer/murder mystery that is more than meets the eye.  I learned a lot about the period and was intrigued by the descriptions of the times; the gangs, cops, the rich and poor, the drug use, the prostitution, and the lack of so many &quot;rights&quot; that we take for granted today.<br />The story itself is basic;  bodies start showing up with similar causes of death.  But how such things are dealt with in the 1890's is nothing we are familiar with in today's world of crime fighting.  Carr brings in a great cast of characters to solve the crimes, a writer (the story is told from his point of view), his friend and mentor &quot;The Alienist&quot; himself (for more about him you'll have to read the book!, it's worth it), a female protagonist with her own set of problems for the day, a set of brother detectives that are ahead of their time and Stevie, a young man taken in by the alienist who will go on to &quot;write&quot; from his point of view another Carr book, 'The Angel of Darkness', which is also a good read.<br />If you enjoy mysteries and adventure and don't mind that some of the descriptions are a bit graphic you'll find this book a real treat.	2001-11-10

(See my review).<br />The characters are the same as in the first book, but this one is told by Stevie, who tells the story after a challenge from the writer of the first.  My one complaint about the writing style, in this book as well as 'The Alienist', is that I would prefer that a story be told from several points of view.  But aside from that, Carr does a good job of letting the reader know what is happening to each person as the story unfolds.<br />In this book, like the first, a trend of murders is discovered and the team of players sets out to solve the crime using sometimes unconventional (for the period) methods.  It gives  the reader a very interesting glimpse of the past.  This story has a much different antagonist than the first book, and Carr does a great job of not repeating the themes from the first book, even though the main characters don't change.  (Which is why I recommend reading the first one first, then this one).	2001-11-10

The author personally interviewed many people and visited actual sites to put together his story which is basically a true account with some conjecture and possible theories thrown in.  As a side note: the movie was a huge disappointment.<br />I read this book with an interesting perspective, my father is a master fisherman and a boat captain who invited me along on a long line trip a couple of years ago.  I was one of a crew of three and got paid a &quot;three quarters share&quot; as I was inexperienced.  We fished out of Hawaii for tuna, which is somewhat different than the sword fishing that takes place in the Atlantic, but the methods and dangers of long lining are similar.<br />The Perfect Storm captures the thoughts and feelings of the crew and the wild behaviors very realistically.  My dad has told me many similar stories about crew spending huge amounts of money at bars and on women.  The work is brutal, as I can testify from personal experience.<br />What I didn't go through (Thank God) is any life threatening danger like what was depicted in the the story, but, I was able to feel, or at least have some sympathy, for the characters because the writing was so compelling.  I was thoroughly engrossed in all the different story lines woven into this account, the rescue workers, the other boats involved in the storm, the weather watchers, and the friends and family of the lost at sea.<br />I highly recommend this book for any that love adventure, history and tragedy.	2001-11-10

Innis lays down a lot of information, and he has some strong opinions.  While you might not agree with all he has to say, he offers straight forward advice and no holds barred points of fact.<br />Besides all that, it is just an interesting book to read and fun too.  He offers some tips on how not to be a &quot;pigeon&quot; (fat lazy birds that beg and simply follow the crowd) that are just good advice and can be applied to endeavors other than painting.  His writing is humorous and often blasts certain types of thinking and institutions.<br />He gives advice on what kind of materials he feels are best, plus tips on how to arrange certain things in you life to be able to paint.<br />His plan on how to launch your career is straight forward, simple to understand and seems very realistic.  The hard part is the work.  This is no &quot;pie in the sky&quot; method, Innis insists that a painter have 2 or 3 hundred paintings under their belt before presenting work to the buying public.  He wants the artist to be a good draftsman before trying to paint.  He wants the artist to use a professional writer and a professional photographer to create a catalog of work.  He doesn't offer any &quot;secret&quot; tricks here, just a solid method to becoming a professional well paid artist.<br />The one area of disagreement I have is that he is a little to emphatic when it comes to certain materials.  He advocates using acrylics on inexpensive canvas with large brushes.  While that is fine for many types of work, it simply doesn't cut it with others such as the seascapes I tend to paint.  I use fine linen (yes it is 200 bucks a roll but it feels so nice) and I use expensive oil paints (the colors and the strengths of pigments make it worth it).  I also use many small brushes for detail work.  But these differences don't really effect the reading of the book, he just gives his reasons why he uses and prefers the types of materials he uses.  He does make a really good point about staying away from watercolor and I have to agree 100 per cent on this.<br />All in all, for any one that is seriously considering trying to launch a career in painting, a career --not a weekend at the park selling 25 dollar paintings-- then this book is a must read and I highly recommend it.s make a really good point about staying away from watercolor and I have to agree 100 per cent on this.<br />All in all, for any one that is seriously considering trying to launch a career in painting, a career --not a weekend at the park selling 25 dollar paintings-- then this book is a must read and I highly recommend it.	2001-11-10

My less than five star rating is simply because this work (like the other Bonhoffer books I've tried to finish) are written in a style that is hard to read.  Maybe it is the loss in the translation or maybe it is because Bonhoffer gets to his points and leaves out anedote, personal information and doesn't quote other writers very much.<br />But these complaints notwithstanding this book is a very fine example of a modern writers words flowing from the very grace of God's Holy Spirit and if someone were to come along and add numbers to many of the sentences they'd be able to convince the unsuspecting that it was truly scripture.<br />Some examples;<br />Ministry of Bearing, page 101; &quot;It is, first of all, the FREEDOM of the other person...that is the burden to the Christian.  The other's freedom collides with his own autonomy, yet [the Christian] must recognize it.  He could get rid of this burden by refusing the other person his freedom, by constraining him and thus doing violence to his personality, by stamping his own image upon him.&quot;<br />One of the ways that Peck defines an evil person in his great work, The People of the Lie, is a person that refuses to recognize the autonomy of others, the narcissistic attitude that &quot;you exist to meet MY needs&quot;.  Compare that with what Bonhoffer describes above and here:<br />Bonhoffer, pg 101, &quot;It is the fellowship of the Cross to experience the burden of the other.&quot;<br />The opposite of evil.<br />More great quotes:<br />Fellowship of the Table, pg 69; &quot;So long as we eat our bread together we shall have sufficient even with the least.  Not until one person desires to keep his own bread for himself does hunger ensue.  This is a strange divine law.&quot;<br />How about the &quot;Ministry of Holding One's Tongue&quot;, &quot;The Ministry of Meekness&quot; and &quot;The Ministry of Listening&quot; for the subjects of short chapters?<br />On sinfulness: &quot;If my sinfulness appears to me to be in any way smaller or less detestable in comparison with the sins of others, I am still not recognizing my sinfulness at all.&quot;<br />Bonhoffer's take on confession needs to be addressed by todays Protestant body.  We seemed to have thrown the baby out with the bath water when it comes to confession of sins.  I think we are so wary of the &quot;priest&quot; that we forget we Christains are all priests.  And if priests, what then is our role?<br />Bonhoffer, pg 112; &quot;When I go to my brother to  confess, I am going to God.&quot; and &quot;Sin demands to have a man by himself.  It withdraws him...&quot; , &quot;Sin wants to remain unknown.&quot;, &quot;In confession the light of the Gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart.&quot;<br />While these may seem platitudes it is in the way Bonhoffer challenges the community to actually work out this confession business in a practical and real way.  If these don't seem at all like platitudes, if we really believe the power and depth here, why aren't we practicing the confession more seriously?  Are we afraid of being too &quot;Catholic&quot;?<br />And as far as that goes, what about all the factions, groups, denominations, and friction we see in the body today?<br />Bonhoffer, pg 37; &quot;...life together under the Word will remain sound and healthy only where it does not form itself into a movement, an order, a society, a collegium pietatis, but rather where it understands itself as being a part of the one, holy, catholic, Christian Church, where it shares actively and passively in the sufferings and struggles and promise of the whole Church.&quot;<br />Read any group of reviews on a controversial Christian book and observe first hand how far, how very far, we are from this &quot;sound and healthy&quot; life together...<br />On the whole I'd highly recommend this work to any one that is going to be working in the church in any fashion, anyone that is part of small group leadership or any seeking Christian that isn't a &quot;lazy&quot; reader.  Don't be lazy, read this book.Christian that isn't a &quot;lazy&quot; reader.  Don't be lazy, read this book.	2001-11-01

I found this book to be very helpful, concise and well written.  It didn't include a lot of &quot;pie in the sky&quot; rhetoric and I felt that the author was honest and experienced.  He concentrates on the stuff a new or just beginning investor would need to know and mostly explains working with single family homes with a little bit about multi family dwellings.<br />Chapters are broken down into topics and Irwin adds little &quot;tips&quot; and lists through out the book.<br />I happen to have a big three ring notebook on real estate investing that my mother bought off a tv commerical sitting on the shelf while I was reading this, so I skimmed through it.  It seemed to me if you left out the hype, the cheerleading, and the dozens of &quot;how to do it with very creative means&quot; I found in the high dollar package basically stated the same advice and observations that Irwin includes in this book at a much lower price and a much easier read.<br />The only downside, and thus the 4 instead of 5 star, is that it is written just a little too much on the light side, but of course Irwin suggests some of his other books to make up the lack.  Good marketing.  I'll probably buy some of his other books myself...	2001-11-01

The ocean, the moon light and the incredible detail are fantasitic.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes looking at great marine art for pleasure or for getting ideas to paint from.  Trying to imagine how this master painted what he did is amazing.  I studied sea scape painting with a modern master, Loren Adams, on Maui and Loren claims this Russia as his greatest influence.  Check out Lorens web site and you'll see the similarities.

Having dabbled in other sci fi offerings, I am convinced that Heinlein is the best and that second place is a long way behind.<br />Perhaps it is because he really is only a  sci fi writer by viture of the settings that his stories take place, but don't be fooled, he isn't really writing about space ships and technology.<br />Take away a few of the props and the Stranger in a Strange Land could just as well be someone from a distant land with a different way of seeing the world.<br />As it is with Heinlein's later works, this book is great because the characters are real hero's, larger than life and they say and do things that we the reader often wish we could say and do.  Heinlein's social commentary is great, even when you find yourself at odds with his conclusions.<br />Heinlein's one fatal flaw is his cynicism, my guess would be that he could't bring himself to even dance with the notion that there might exist a benvolent God in the universe and it clouds his thinking and writing.  It becomes more apparent in this work after having read many more of his works and then coming back to this for a second read.<br />But that isn't to say his views aren't important and well spoken, even as a Christian and opposed to his overall world view, I find this book a great read and making important points along the way.	2001-10-27

How about if she was not really human?<br />I think Heinlein does a good job of presenting a womans point of view, albeit Friday is an android and not really a &quot;woman&quot; in the first place.  He touches on many social/political themes in this book, his future vision of California is a riot, I think perhaps he may be called in the future a type of Nostradamus.<br />I first read this as a teenager and loved the adventure, the sex themes and the overall story line.  The second time I read this book, having been through many other Heinlein books and being older, I also enjoyed the commentary that I missed earlier.<br />I would recommend reading this book and 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress', 'Stranger..' before going into the later much longer works of Heinlein.<br />I'll bet someone will make a movie based on this book someday and I am equally sure it will be botched and screwed up much like was done with 'Starship Troopers'.	2001-10-27

BUT, if you haven't read a good amount of Heinlien, don't start with this one as you'll be missing out on a lot of nuances.  He brings in characters from other books, and not just his own either.<br />I recommend reading several early works and include at a minimum 'Stranger...', 'Time...', 'The Moon' and a couple of the shorter novellas.<br />Heinlien plays with time, multi universes, history, politics and religion and of course does it with &quot;real&quot; heros, characters that love and live, fight and play and in general have adventures that stimulate the mind of the reader.<br />Like almost all of his books, it's a better read the second time around because there is just so much there, but even if read just for the adventure without thinking about all the between the lines stuff this book is just plain fun.	2001-10-27

This book, like most of Heinlein's works, interweaves social commentary with adventure and intrigue.  The characters often take on a little life of there own and some find themselves revisited in later works by Heinlein.  What is wonderful about this and other similar works is that even though they are sci fi, they really aren't.  Don't for a minute assume that reading this book is similar to reading a space adventure that dwells on technical and scientific details for plot and story development.  Heinlein goes into man's mind and motives and here lies the story.  The space stations and rockets are mere props.	2001-10-27

If you become a fan, you won't bother reading reviews, you'll just read it.<br />This book of course really isn't sci fi, not in the literal sense of what sci fi is usually thought to be.  A lot of the story takes place in the past, and most of the story is about people and mainly one woman and her take on life.<br />If you're interested in Heinlien, start reading some of his earlier works, you'll have months and months of reading before you should consider picking up this one.<br />As to the themes of sex, incest, etc that Heinlein brashly includes in this (and all of his larger) works, they only make sense in the broader picture of all his works, trying to say this is not a good book because it has so much incest, sex, etc is a comment coming from someone that hasn't really read Heinlein at all unless they are claiming that they have read ten books by a guy that they give 1 star too...

Lewis to at least hear some of the the answers to Heinlein's cynicism.<br />This is indeed one of Heinleins great books, but aren't they all good?  Unlike the bulk of his work, which really only reads well in a certain order, this book stands alone in that a reader doesn't need to know who Mike, Lazarus, the Twins, etc. are in order to follow the story.<br />Being a born again evangelical myself, one might think I wouldn't like or be offended by such a work.  On the contrary I loved this book as I do of all Heinleins work.  But I have also read the &quot;Book of Job&quot; (probably the oldest book in the bible and one of the oldest of mankinds surviving texts) and see Heinleins view of God as being opposite of tradition (which matters, I think, even though he of course is writing fiction).  Some  may disagree, but if they haven't read the &quot;original&quot; Job, they are at a disadvantage, yes?<br />Heinlein's take that Jehovah and Lucifer are brothers is of course not totally original, the Mormom's have the belief that Jesus and Lucifer are competing brothers of Jehovah, but Heinlein makes an unspoken assertion that Jehovah was the cause of Job's trouble in the original story, which is simply not true.<br />In the Book of Job it is Satan that comes to God and claims that Job only gives Him lip service because God has shown him so much favor.  God assents to allow Satan to test him.<br />What does all this have to do with a sci fi/ fantasy book?  Well in other reviews of Heinleins work I insist that the reader MUST read them in a certain order. 'Number of the Beast' doesn't read nearly as well if taken alone and 'The Cat Who Walks..' is a bad place to start reading Heinlein..<br />I think that to really get the most out of this work, it really helps to have read the Book of Job, which is a literary giant in it's own right.  I'd recommend C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity too, but that might be pushing it.	2001-10-27

It's too bad that the publishers couldn't put a disclaimer on the cover of this book.  I just read a reviewer that said he read 'Starship Troopers' and thought he'd try another Heinlein because he liked Starship.  What a shame.  To appreciate Heinlein a reader must start at the beginning of his career (or near it) and then move on.<br />I am glad the movie sparked so much interest in Heinlein, he remains the greatest sci fi writer of all time.  The only way to win an arguement that he isn't the best would be to argue that he really didn't write sci fi in the first place but rather a weird combination of social/polictical/religeous adventure stories that span past/present and future.<br />I loved this book.  Every bit, even the confusion.  I'll admit I wasn't happy with the ending, but that is only because I wanted it to end differently, not because it was poorly written.<br />BUT, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, either you love Heinlien already and you will read this, or you should start elsewhere and fall in love with his work for what it is.	2001-10-27

Long is a hero's hero, and as his book chronicles his history, Heinlein is able to comment on a vast array of subjects that affect society, all centered around the loves and life of the hero Lazarus.  It takes a few pages as Heinlein sets up the story, but once the book starts rolling it is a nonstop page turner even though it is actually many stories wrapped in a story that spaces many many decades and cultures.<br />Something of a futurist, Heinlein never loses sight of the fact that man is still man.  Whether during world war two or in the future when he can fly to other worlds, man has to live, love, eat and work.  This brillant work is my favorite Heinlein book and I while I highly recommend it, I'd perhaps recommend a reader that is new to Heinlein to start with &quot;Stranger', 'Moon..' or even 'Friday' first, then come to this work with a little of his style under your skin.	2001-10-27
US	51062124	R9CGZW76LR2GL	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A lesson in History and Political Science	Heinlein is not just a great science fiction/fantasy writer he is simply one of the greatest modern writers.  The reason that more of this works are not made into movies is probably due to the fact that part of what makes his books and stories so great is how he presents his take on life, politics and social issues through the characters he writes about and the condition of the societies they live in.  That is why the movie made from this book is nothing more than a movie based on the shell of what this book is about and really has almost nothing whatsoever to do with the book itself.<br />While this book may seem to glorify (or perhaps even over simplify) war it really isn't a book about war at all.  While a war provides the setting (and Heinlein does get a little technical) the story is really a coming of age story about a boy becoming a man in a future culture that has different standards/rules.  It really doesn't matter if Heinlein is presenting this culture as having better or worse standards/rules than America, it is fiction after all, and part of the joy of reading Heinlein is the way he makes readers ponder whether or not an idea has merit or not.<br />Heinlein has a way of presenting arguments in his story that seem to flow effortlessly along with the action so that the reader may be getting a lesson (or a lecture) on history or politics and yet not mind at all, the work stays a work of fiction and the reader is compelled forward as in any good novel.<br />Some important thoughts I got from the book:<br />1. Women can serve many roles, some even better than men, but a society that puts women in the infantry as a front line solider is a society that has lost its moral compass.  It is ironic that in the movie version there were women serving in combat units just the opposite of what happens in the book.<br />2. Forced \\"service\\" isn't service at all, it is slavery.  Heinlein never wrote about conscription as being a good thing for a society.  Men that don't want to fight for liberty, justice and to protect women and children have no honor.<br />3. Recruitment into the military should be difficult (at least into the combat branches).  Contrast that with today's military recruiters that lie about the military to get young men and women to sign up.  In the book Johnny is told how hard it will be, how terrible combat can be, he is given the chance to change his mind.<br />4. Once in the combat unit training part of the story Heinlein presents a very tough and strenuous boot camp.  Also it is as realistic as possible (men can die in training).  While I don't want to call my boot camp experience \\"easy\\" (Fort Knox 1991) I can say that the policy at the time seemed to be filled with waste and was still geared towards the \\"dumb conscript\\" mentality.<br />5. Voting should be more than just a generic right to everyone 18 and older.  Some states currently have restrictions regarding the voting rights of felons, so the basic tenet that Heinlein presents here isn't all that shocking, he just presents a society that has a bigger expectation than \\"don't be a rapist or a murder\\".<br />6. Heinlein foresaw many developments in military science, but more importantly I think, he saw that the countries on this planet were going to become more dependent on each other as time goes by.  As we become more \\"global\\" in nearly all aspects of life this theme of the book really rings true.  While I don't foresee the earth being attacked by alien bugs any time soon, the fact that there can be global \\"wars\\" against terrorism, disease or natural and man made disasters that can have effects on many countries simultaneously is not something limited to the realm of science fiction.<br />I give this book a very strong recommendation.  My only reservation is that to really enjoy and to fully understand any of Heinlein's books it really helps to have read a few of them already.ant to fight for liberty, justice and to protect women and children have no honor.<br />3.

This book got me interested in researching Irish history a little bit more and of course eventually I ended up reading Angela's Ashes.  I highly recommend this work to anyone with an interest in history, my only negative comment comes from reading the next two in the series, Gift of the Jews and Desire of the Hills  and finding that the second two are more &quot;readable&quot; than the first.

Zuckerman is an agent with enough experience to deserve the ear of anyone wanting some basic advice and &quot;how-to&quot; on writing a best seller.  He give lots of examples and explains clearly some basic rules and then gives some examples of the rules and also some examples of the rules being broken.  What really makes this book a winner are the actual examples he gives of a Follet outline.<br />Zuckerman mentions that reading the outline might get boring at places, but I was never bored.  Intrigued to see how the development of a story actually happens including the addition and deletion of characters I was hooked and could barely put the book down.<br />A time bomb, no a gun, no maybe a fire.  A German spy, no a Russian diplomat, no wait a minute......<br />Seeing how it's really done, how an idea evolves through the outline form to the story and then how rough draft changes to final draft make this book interesting and informative.<br />I finished this book hoping I could someday befriend the author myself, maybe after writing my own blockbuster, hey, a guy can dream, yes?	2001-10-26

Sure enough I had gone through &quot;Fish&quot; about a year or so early in my mother's kitchen after coming over to cook some fresh ahi I had caught out of San Diego.  I read through this book simply because it is a great read for anyone interested in serving fish.  Bittman has a way with words, it isn't often that I sit and read a cookbook for pleasure, but his knowledge and understanding of fish, buying it, cooking it, serving it were interesting enough that I read about more stuff than I'll probably ever have time to try.  For anyone interested in seafood as a specialty, get this book, as for cookbooks in general his &quot;How to cook Everything&quot; is number one.	2001-10-24

Assuming that you haven't read Grishom yet my advice; read 'A Time to Kill' first.  The Author wrote that first and I think it is a better way to get into his mind and style.  The intial printing of his first book was small, so most people read Firm first, as did I, but I really think as good as this one is, 'A Time to Kill' is more personal, more emotional and is really a better story.<br />The Firm is a solid story with plently of action and suspense and should be read along with the 'Pelican Brief', 'The Client' and 'A Time to Kill' before you read 'The Runaway Jury' and 'The Rainmaker' only because I think the latter two wouldn't be quite as fun as they are without a good base on how Grisham writes and thinks.	2001-10-24

Don't read it first or second, the early books really need to be read first to really get the most out of this one (The Runaway Jury too).  How Grishom writes with such ease is one of those mysteries that I wish I could solve.  While this book has its hard looks at serious issues including spousal abuse, family hatreds, insurance scams, ambulance chasers and the rest, it really scores in the humor department, it's just a good fun book.  But really, read at least two or three earlier works first it'll make this one so much better.	2001-10-24

But it is certainly fun hunting once armed with solid information.  This book is a real good place to start for someone thinking about becoming a collector, a part time dealer, or someone that is interested in obtaining a better collection through trading.  I'd also recommend this book for someone that has had a family collection of books passed down, know what you have before getting rid of it at a yard sale.<br />One more person that would benefit from this book is the reader that wants to branch out, never read sci fi or mystery? Well Ellis has an extensive list of modern authors that he recommends buying for collecting but guess what, they are collectable because they are well written, so if you want to try out something new this list is a great place to look.	2001-10-24

As I was reading this book I got the feeling that the author had made a big success in the &quot;Darkness&quot; books and then got lazy.  The characters just fall short of being real heroes or villians, the action too forced.  It isn't that this book isn't interesting, nor did I fail to finish reading it, I was just expecting much more.  On the plus side, I got my son (13 at the time) to read it and he loved it (it's hard to even get him to read non school stuff so this was a blessing indeed).  I think for what it is, it's ok, but if you're expecting something on par with what Peretti did ten years early, sorry.	2001-10-24

Since it wasn't really reading material, per se, but more like a book for lawyers or a reference for someone already importing stuff or about to, I wasn't really impressed.

He doesn't just give a recipe for cooking lamb, something I tried for the first time recently, he gives variations to basic recipes which allows for hundreds of combinations and let's me cook with ingredients I have on hand.  I felt confident cooking a meat I had never tried before.  He mentions to the reader that it might be a good idea to try out the creme brulee before trying to impress guests, I ignored his advice of course, and despite the fact its presentation was lacking, everyone loved the flavor and texture.<br />If I could have only one cookbook, this would be it without question, the lists and illustrations are fabulous and the recipes are explained in a way that I feel more than confident trying new things.<br />Whether needing a simple macaroni and cheese recipe or an exotic dessert I go to this cookbook first and since owning I haven't needed another.	2001-10-24

I think it should be read first if you haven't already read 'The Firm' or any of the other bestsellers that Grishom seems to write with ease.  The jury scene when the protagonist asks the other members to close their eyes and listen is very powerful and makes the major point of the book.  As for the movie made from this book, it's the one that seems to come closest to what the book was trying to say.

There are a few problems with this book, the most glaring one being that if a major newspaper came out with a story that the bones of Jesus were found most Christians I know would laugh, I don't care how serious the reports.  Most people would &quot;know that they know&quot; that it would end up being a hoax and there lies the problem with this story line. I also found many of the people depicted just a bit to much &quot;overboard&quot; and the romance part of the book was a bit &quot;forced&quot;.  On the positive side, I enjoyed reading this book and trying to figure out if the author was going to let us hang at the end or solve the mystery, I would suggest giving this book to a christian friend as a gift, but try and convience them that it was written by an atheist.	2001-10-23

The Prince of Tides should be read by anyone with a tragic suffering childhood, it really helps to see that someone understands.  I'd imagine that someone that had a wonderful upbringing and was bestowed with love and affection just might not &quot;get it&quot; but even such a person couldn't help but be touched by this story unless they owned a dead heart.

And man's heart is often a dark and terrible place.<br />What really makes this book great are the little victories, those things that made me the reader long for the great sense of love and community that followed the Joad family wherever they went.<br />  Sometimes a man's heart has been recreated, and when it has, nothing dark or evil can overcome.	2001-10-22

John's classes when a photographer from an Australian art magazine came for one of the sessions and took photos of that day's work.  E. John explained that not only an article was being done, but that he was working on a new book as well.  Obviously a book cannot come close to actually being there, but this book does as well of a job as one could expect.  E. John's explainations are clear and easy to read, the photo's are great and the general layout is excellent.  This book should definately be in the library of any artist interested in the sea, beginner or acomplished.	2001-10-22

Being taken off guard, not expecting a history lesson, I was engrossed in his takes on Martin Luther King Jr, Gandi and others including some of people that he knows (or has known) as personal friends.  This book is another must read for any Yancey fan, I am  becoming a completist myself (as the wallet permits) and count him just under C.S. Lewis as a &quot;you gotta read this book&quot; kind of author.	2001-10-22

John was truely &quot;great&quot;, at least in my opinion, shows very basic techniques that he used as he was becoming the master he is today.  The reason that his book is a must have for any marine  painters libary is because it shows the work and technique before E. John  could do what he does so &quot;effortlessly&quot;.  I have attended a one  week painting workshop with E. John and I found this book very helpful in  pointing out the basics of wave, sky, rock, light, shadow and foam  structure.	2000-05-28
