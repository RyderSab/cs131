Having read Professor Rodger's excellent 'Wooden World' I was expecting much of the same and was not disappointed - this is an impeccably researched and erudite alternative history of England and its French dominions, which puts the naval element into full perspective . <br />Absolutely chock-full of notes and references, this nontheless flows as well as any historical novel, highlighting the hitherto unseen good and bad points of the various rulers of the day, and the key role that naval support provided, giving a new slant on history and politics. There are more twists and turns to the story than any TV soap could possibly invent. <br />What comes across loud and clear is the futility of war: the waste of money and resources in the pursuit of expansion is illustrated by the singular lack of success by all parties to make any substantial territorial gains - French, Dutch, Flemish, Scots or Scandinavian. <br />Imbedded in the politics is a reasoned overview of the development of the ship; from longboat and cog, through galley, hulk and caravel to the rise of the 3-masted ship-rigged vessel which came to dominate naval warfare in the following 200 years. The gradual change from supply and support vessel to an active ingredient of the war machine develops as technology improves, and the  viability of funding a navy become more financially and logistically sound. <br />As one might expect from a work of this scope, the text is rounded off with a conclusion condensing the preceding 1000 years into a prcis with the author's informed slant. There are 5 appendices (chronology, ships, fleets, pay & officials), a large reference, glossary, abbreviations and a huge bibliography. <br />For a complete overview of the mediaeval history of the British Isles, you can't go far wrong with this excellent book. Then read the follow-up - twice as large, covering a third of the time. *****	2005-03-21

Neighbouring islanders, salvaged materials and the ingenuity of the survivors combine to provide a comfortable semblance of home, which is rudely shattered by the appearance of a Dutch VOC ship collecting human 'cargo'. Jack is persuaded by circumstances and his friend Paul that the only way to right the wrongs of the world is to take action - and there is action aplenty in this gripping, although slightly pulpy, first novel from Hackman & Lenihan. <br />Well-drawn characters and an intriguing plot combine to make a story to rival the best in the genre.	2005-03-21

A cut above your normal teen-market fantasy that wouldn't be out of place on the adult shelves. In the same vein as 'Mortal Engines' this novel has a fluid quality that a collaboration of two authors doesn't normally have. <br /> <br />An unusual situation is presented; in a world where magic is the norm - in fact a must - appears a boy who possesses none. Moreover, magic doesn't seem to recognise him, and his touch dissolves spells. Add to this his extraordinary mechanical aptitude, which makes him an extremely dangerous quantity to the panicked establishment, who will stop at nothing to be rid of him. But is all as it seems? ...  <br /> <br />Credulity is stretched at times, but one can forgive that as the pace and flow of this engaging fantasy carries one along, immersed in the story, that ends rather abruptly, in preparation for the sequel. ****	2005-03-05

The story starts off in a rather stilted manner, but gradually becomes more flowing and thus more enjoyable as the book progresses, although halfway through it gets a little bogged-down and I felt as though in a dream, with something just out of reach - almost understanding, but not quite - until we discover exactly what the cup is and does.  <br />Unusually, the story is told only from the central character's viewpoint; so wars happen and coups take place, but we only hear about them as and when Phaedra does, which can be a little disconcerting until one gets used to it. Aimed at the early teen audience, it is nevertheless enjoyable to the older reader. <br />An apparently simple plot; the teenage daughter of a powerful lord attends her coming-out presentation at court, only to spurn all advances in favour of her dream prince - literally, she has never laid eyes on him until he abducts her. Seemingly oblivious to the war she has just started she marries him and embraces her new existence with hardly a thought for the pain and turmoil she has left behind her, or for the strange society she now lives in. And, like a typical willful, insecure child, nothing suits her, everyone and everything conspires against her - you just want to give her a good smack! <br />But then, seemingly disparate threads come together with a sense of trepidation and foreboding to create a complex, compelling mediaeval tale in the old fantasy tradition. ****	2005-03-05

Written down word for word by a monk under a vow of silence, as recounted by the unwilling hero Jude, this is a tale of England at the time of the Black Death, heavy with moral overtones, life's lessons, and insight into peasant life, as Jude tries to make sense of all that is happening around him.  <br />Pity, compassion and a sense of justice compel him to set free a strange fairground freak, befriend and heal her, then together they rid the land of the terrible creature that plagues it. In doing so, Jude discovers how fear turns to hate, greed to cruelty, and friendship to love. As well as finding his inner strength and self-worth, he discovers that beauty is mostly inside and in the eye of the beholder. <br />Although simply and archaicly written, the narrative flows, carrying one along with the adventure, immersed in the plot. In the accompanying (sometimes bawdy) descriptions we learn a little cultural and social history, as well as what made the mediaeval mind tick. What takes a little getting used to are the stilted, one-sided conversations with the silent scribe who's been instructed to 'copy every word', that preface each chapter - but it adds a certain charm to this lovely, addictive book. *****	2005-03-05

First in a series by the excellent Richard Woodman that never quite took off in the same way that the Nathaniel Drinkwater series has. <br />Kite is a man on the run from a false charge of murder, who ships aboard a guineaman - a slave ship bound for the west coast of Africa as surgeon. What he witnesses during the voyage shocks him so much that he develops a conscience that doesn't allow the use of slaves in his business - to the extent that he marries a black princess, much to the horror and censure of his friends and colleagues. <br />Setting up shop in the W Indies on the fringes of the 7 Year's War, Kite weathers intolerance and nature's forces in a fast-paced, rollicking tale that continues in 'Privateersman'. <br />As always with Mr Woodman, a worthwhile read from a man who is steeped in the romance of the sea. ****	2005-03-05

Second in a series by the excellent Richard Woodman that never quite took off in the same way that the Nathaniel Drinkwater series has. Set in an earlier time of the mid 17th Century, Kite is an entrepreneur and businessman rather than the confirmed navy type, and this reflects in the flow of the story; there is not the same action and pace, although there is plenty of intrigue. <br />Kite is now a partner in an established shipping firm, but cholera is on the loose ... <br />Stunned by the loss of his son and the fetish suicide of his wife, Kite is galvanised into action by the news of a conspiracy by his erstwhile colleagues. Little realising the extent of the censure arising from his marriage to a black princess, he handed control of his business to his partner, who was secretly in dire pecuniary straits. The partner's death played into the hands of his creditors who are about to fleece Kite, who, thanks to a loyal employee, spikes their guns. <br />As always with Mr Woodman, a worthwhile read from a man who is steeped in the romance of the sea. ****	2005-03-05

The pairing of down-to-earth Kydd with the intellectual Renzi continues to lift this series above the run-of-the-mill (although Kydd has lost most of his gaucheness by now). <br /> <br />Promotion within the ranks has come to both, as a result of the Caribbean experience in 'Seaflower', and they are part of the Mediterranean Fleet - although in different ships. <br />While Renzi is 'enjoying' the battle at Cape St.Vincent, Kydd is stuck in Gibraltar 'suffering' the attentions of the Town Major's wife. His new confidante Cockburn tries to warn him off - to no avail, so Renzi drags him off to Venice, where they are trapped by Boney's invading forces. They escape, thanks to an 'ex' of Renzi's, but a tough decision by Renzi seems to signal an end to the friendship as they return to Blighty - and the Nore mutiny. Kydd is in the forefront, but miraculously earns a pardon (thanks to Renzi), then finds himself in the thick of the bloody battle at Camperdown. <br /> <br />Altogether a seeming mish-mash of events ... but after all, this is exactly what a seaman's life would be like: no plan; no greater purpose; no battle tactics; no 'story'; just go where the Admiralty sends the ship and do what the captain commands ... This is what the author is trying to convey in this series - the story is in life's little details.  <br /> <br />And very good detail it is; the author's personal research into the locations produces a highly-believable account of  little-known events in the most volatile period in British naval history. There follows a taster of the next book 'Quarterdeck', and, as we have come to expect in this genre, his sources of the facts behind the fiction. <br /> <br />This is the most in-depth depiction of the infamous mutiny that I've read, as - for the last time - through Kydd's eyes we see more of the behind-the-scenes machinations than if he were an Aubrey or Hornblower. *****	2005-02-22

A bestseller in its classic first edition for 15 years, the guide's massive technical updates and new sections make an even more valuable contribution, with simplified instructions on ways to apply the latest innovations and how to make the best projects from the past even better. Sections on current models and major parts of the scroll saw; accessories; how to select a saw; blades, speeds, & feeds; safety techniques & guidelines; patterns & layout; scroll-sawing basics; stack-cutting & cutting thick wood; sawing thin & small stock; compound sawing; inlay work; marquetry basics; fine fretwork; appliques & overlays; joinery; sawing plastics; sawing metals; segmentation & intarsia; finishing basics. <br />  <br />The synopsis above says it all, but what it doesn't say is how readable and informative it is. I first saw the early edition of this book at my uncle's, and spent the entire evening engrossed in it, to the dismay of my wife and aunt, but delight of my uncle. Subsequently I purchased the new updated version, and was pleasantly surprised at how many of the modern saws were included and appraised. Although American, so are the majority of the designs in your major Hardware Store (even if they're actuallly produced in China or Taiwan). <br /> <br />The history of the scroll saw is given, with plenty of pictures of the various makes, showing improvements and simplifications to the basic design. Then we get the theory and mechanics of scroll sawing and why some designs are better and/or more or less expensive than others - what you get for your money, in short. <br /> <br />The book manages to avoid the trap of 'designs that any idiot can make', instead detailing the whole gamut of techniques, blades, jigs and materials to enable one toproduce anything from the simplest to the most complex, professional-looking piece of work. <br /> <br />Loaded with hints, tips, Dos&Dont's, this is a must-buy for all woodwork/filigree enthusiasts. *****	2005-02-19

The introduction of this book should not be skipped, as it is a very illuminating description of how and why the book came to be. <br />Having obtained a manuscript of a sailor's journal (which appeared to be the genuine article) in a fortuitous proxy bid at an auction, Mr. Dann has to assure himself and his publishers that it really is what it purports to be, prior to publication. Thus follows an account of the detective work done to validate the journal. The investigation leads through the US fiscal, military and naval archives, via the UK records, to Australia - all of which confirm the accuracy of the journal's dates, if not the content. However, there seems no reason to disbelieve the story, other than the tallness of the tale - but as we all know, the truth is often stranger than fiction ... <br />The transcript of the journal follows - miss-spellings, quaint phraseology, enigmatic punctuation and all (although thankfully some apposite corrections have been made). Each chapter is prefaced by an introduction which puts the following journal entries into historical context, provides background information and also explains terms which may not be familiar to the lay reader. Comprehensive notes elaborate on salient points and provide corroboration of Nagle's text. <br />The journal itself is unique in that it traces the daily life of the common seaman, rather than that of the movers and shakers of the time (there is a later journal by John Nichol which is far cruder and carries much less detail); this is a record of Jack Tar at work and at play, on land and at sea, at home and away - something that is very rare and should be treasured for the information it holds. <br />A must for every nautical historian's bookshelf.	2005-02-18

Try not to be put off by the title; yes, they do feature prominently in the book, but that is not the basic thrust of Mr. Diamond's excellent book. <br />This is more about how equally intelligent 'tribes' of the same species came to differ so greatly in their development, and ultimately why one faction now pulls the strings of the world. <br />To examine this in the correct perspective, Mr Diamond goes to the dawn of pre-history, asks the questions a child might ask, then attempts to answer them as convincingly as possible by drawing on the vast resources of available data and his own formidable intellect. Strangely, this doesn't result in a dry-as-dust treatise you might find in Nature journal, but in a highly enjoyable, thought-provoking read, illustrated by many little-known factual historical events. Many of the chapters did appear in Nature, as it happens, but the reasoned logic and step-by-step arguments make this as accessible and readable for the lay reader as the academic. The chapters on how and why our food came to be domesticated are particularly llluminating. <br />Naturally, in a book of such scope, there remain many unanswered questions, but surely this will stimulate much more debate and research - at the same time correcting some long-held racist dogma. <br />An excellent read. *****	2005-02-18

The pairing of down-to-earth Kydd with the intellectual Renzi reminds one of Aubrey and Maturin in the O'Brian series and the literary edge it gives to those books. On page 8 there is a neat piece of homage to Patrick O'Brian when, to Renzi's stunned amazement, the crew casually swig premier cru Haut Brion like it was common blackstrap. <br /> <br />After the humdrum life on 'Duke William', Kydd and his mates are transferred to the 32-gun frigate Artemis, where he immediately finds action in a bloody one-to-one battle with an adversary of similar size. On a high with excitement and adulation after the success, Kydd is brought sharply back to earth by his sister's news of their father's failing eyesight. Seeing his dreams crumbling around him, he returns home - gutted, and is slowly succumbing to apathy when Renzi appears, galvanizing him into action with a plan which promises to put all to rights.  <br /> <br />Kydd is soon off to sea again on a secret mission, where a sensitively-written romantic interlude suddenly evolving into entrapment is handled by Kydd grasping it like a nettle. Renzi's reaction to this interlude leaves us wondering if his friendship with Kydd is all it seems on the surface, or are there suppressed desires beneath? <br />Kydd is roused from his introspection by promotion and an unexpected visit to the South Seas, where Renzi's sexuality is established, but his ideals of the 'noble savage' are dispelled in a horrific way. The voyage home is beset by problems, culminating in a real cliff-hanger - followed by a taster of the next book 'Seaflower', and, as we have come to expect in this genre, a historical note outlining the facts behind the fiction. <br />This is up there with the best. ****	2005-01-31

Nevertheless, it manages to captivate the older audience as well, making it a book that an adult enjoys reading to kids (and alone, if truth were told!). <br />Four chapters are joined together by a red thread, so the story flows well, the believable characters have substance, and there is enough cliff-hanging drama to keep the smallest child pestering one for the next session. <br />Forget that stuff about it being 'too horrible' - kids love being frightened just a little. <br />I urge every parent to buy this for their children.***** <br />	2005-01-19

This is a celebration of the canoe-builders' art that almost never materialsed. Adney's notes and models could well have disappeared had it not been for some timely intervention by far-sighted individuals to preserve the collection and organise his notes into this and other books.  <br />But surely a canoe is a canoe is a canoe... not after reading this! Such wonderfully crisp photos, taken from all angles with great depth of field, give a complete idea of each craft. The subtleties of design, use of materials and construction techniques leave one in no doubt as to the differences in ethnic origins beween canoes that at first glance look more or less similar. <br />The quality and detail of the notes that Adney made for each drawing is a lesson for all would-be modellers ... nothing seems to have been left out; insets have minute details highlighted; there are cross-sections of ordinary-looking bits of wood; and stages in construction and building techniques are shown.  Adney's models are a testament - both to human ingenuity in the use of available materials, and to one man's lifelong devotion to preserving a dying craft (in both senses). <br />His contribution to art, ethnology and archaeology cannot be overstated. <br />	2005-01-19

Considering the scope of its content, this book is remarkably compact; if any accusation can be made, it's that there is too much information ... Mr.Woodman manages to squeeze in details of almost every naval commander (including many rarely-seen portraits) and their exploits without repeating himself or losing one's interest. The downside is that his usually fluid literary style is curtailed somewhat, and the barrage of different names can be a little confusing at times. However, by giving us a comprehensive history of Britain's finest (and a few non-British), we see exactly where O'Brian, Lunn, Lambdin, Forester et al (incl. Woodman!) got their material and inspiration from ... recognising most of the actions, with names changed, in many of their books. <br />Nor is the action much diminished by reasons of space; the thrill of the chase and the bloody battles are all there, one following hard on the heels of the last, complete with the political and logistical rationale driving the events at sea and on land. One fact stands out from the rest:- the huge disparity in the numbers of killed and injured between the British and European forces, French losses often 5 times or more than the British, doubtless due to the French predilection for firing high, more than the British rate of fire. <br />This superb book illustrates exactly how and why Britain's Navy became master of the oceans - what a reference book! <br />This is history the way it should be told.  <br />	2005-01-14

There are plenty of other famous ships, but none had the fortune to engineer the collection and safe conduct of the most famous and wanted man in the world from his enemies in France.

This fictionalised journal (written decades after the event when Defoe was only 5 years old) argues its case better by a bald statement of facts, than by any elaborate literary devices. This reads like it is meant to be, a journal, bringing home the horrors of that awful time in a way that a second-hand description could never do. <br />Having said that, this account IS second-hand; it is only Defoe's journalistic expertise, boyhood memories and down-to-earth style that make it so believable. <br /> <br />BUT - anyone who reads this should not expect another Gulliver's Travels - it IS heavy going; it's not a book that one can curl up with & relax, you have to work for your entertainment. <br /> <br />The main point that comes across is the constant religious undercurrent, which was, I guess, typical of the time (if not of Defoe) and the willingness to attach blame for anything unusual to outsiders, or God's will, rather than examine their own circumstances (so what's changed in 339 years!?). As one of the few records of that terrible year, this deserves a place on any amateur historian's bookshelf.	2005-01-07

Love's young dream, in the shape of the free-spirited Julia, encourages his artistic bent and tries to divert his path from the sea to that of an artist. She fails, despite baring her soul to him, for he is too callow and introverted to understand her underlying goal (as most men are with women). He is intent on gaining experience of sail, as an addition to his steam ticket, so he signs up as deck-hand on a 4-master bound for Australia. They part on an ambivalent note, and a 4-year separation and lost letters do nothing to cement the relationship, resulting in a disappointment for both as he returns - the saving grace being his continued painting during the trip. <br />Now passed for Master, he rejoins his ship, after gaining artistic fame through Julia's contacts, foiling a plot against the Govt. and vastly disillusioning himself with life. <br />More travels and escapades ensue as the world descends into The Great War, culminating in near-tragedy for James and an unexpected twist to the tale which completes a cycle of intrigue begun in 'Waterfront'. <br />Quite different to Mr. Woodman's Nathaniel Drinkwater series, in that it is set a century later in a soon-to-be-shattered peacetime on a merchantman, and focuses on James' personal life, rather than naval tactics. However, it still has that master's touch of fluid, easy reading, combining  vivid descriptions of handling a square-rigger in both storms and fair winds with tender handling of a young man's  aspirations to art and love.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended	2005-01-07

US	52240154	R2EXZR6ZC85RK8	B0006CVUJW	273377297	Captain Hornblower, RN	Books	2	0	2	N	N	Very disappointed.	In the fine fighting tradition of Nelson's Navy, there is plenty of quarterdeck action in these first three Hornblower tales, but almost nothing of below-deck life. <br />And what a pompous, condescending, self-satisfied boor Hornblower is - in that respect he probably epitomises the large majority of RN Captains at that time, accustomed as they were to instant obediance with no questioning of orders. But I found the patronising tone taken with his wife (poor woman) to be chauvinistic at best. God knows why he married her in the first place, certainly it wasn't for intellectual stimulation, nor mutual comfort; one feels he much prefers sailing and ship-board life.  <br />His patronising extends to his officers as well, and every decision he makes seems designed to bolster the view of The Great Captain Who Makes No Mistakes ... a thoroughly unlikeable fellow. <br />Still, the story did teach me something about canals, as Hornblower makes his way to London to take up his commission, but there is something very dour and dry about these tales that does not grab one the way that other writers' stories do. They were probably fine for their time, but they pale into insignificance in the face of today's better writers.	2005-01-07

He has that great skill in conveying in a few well-chosen words the exact picture of the person, not physically, but his innermost being. In a few phrases, we understand the makeup of the protagonists:- Dunbar = Pip, in his juvenile infatuation with Conchita = Estelle, who spurns his gauche advances; Williams = Magwitch in so far as his actions spur Dunbar to discover his artistic birthright; and Ms Hawkeshawe = Miss Havisham in having been robbed of a normal life, lives it vicariously in the darkened upper floor of a bordello, taking solace in the arms of Sappho. <br /> <br />A stage is being set... It is the early 1900s, a steamship delivering a conveyor system to a remote mining town in Mexico gives the crew plenty of shore leave - the contrast between the mindless lust of the crew, the puritanical naivety of parson's son Dunbar, and the Captain's calculating machinations to secure a compliant young wife to replace the harridan he had, make for some interesting social comment. <br />But things don't turn out as expected, which makes gripping reading, especially at the climax, when Ms Hawkeshawe confronts her erstwhile tormentor - then the stage is turned upside-down. <br /> <br />The young Dunbar emerges not unscathed, but matured, mellowed and now possessed of a new driving force to his life. <br /> <br />Quite different to Mr.Woodman's Nathaniel Drinkwater series, in that it it is set largely on land and a century later, it still has that master's touch of fluid easy reading, while painting vivid pictures in the mind - the follow-on promises to be just as good.  <br /> <br />Strongly recommended	2005-01-07

A great book, but I kept wanting more detail about the discoveries (both geographical and biological), although this would make the book much longer and it is only meant to be an overview of the voyage.  <br />Particularly interesting for me were the descriptions of Cook and Banks; previously, I had the impression that Cook was a strict disciplinarian and a well-seasoned captain from the landed gentry, instead of a relatively raw, working-class officer (albeit expert in navigation and surveys); and that Banks was a well-established, older member of the Royal Society, rather than the young rake on a personal collecting trip.  <br />This last impression is gradually overturned as we see Banks transform into an avid collector, graphic journalist and good friend of our rather dour Captain (who was in fact only a Lieutenant, surprisingly). <br />The story is well told, keeping the pace and not falling into the trap of describing every boring day between landfalls, but at the same time expanding on certain salient points - e.g. the rounding of The Horn and the protracted stay in Tahiti, which was a comfortable interlude for Cook, but a disaster for Bligh, - which goes to show how different characters handle the same situation (and how wrong my initial impression of Cook was). <br /> <br />Chapter 9 - the passage where the ship is holed on the reef - is so tense, and the consequences of failure so terrible to contemplate, I was on the edge of my seat reading like crazy, but not wanting it to finish, it was so exciting. <br /> <br />After surviving the reef, the ship finally arrives at 'civilization' - Banks is less than complimentary on the living conditions in this 'palace in a dung-heap', which immediately begin to tell on the crew.  <br />One gets the almost palpable sense of despair and helplessness surrounding Cook as he sees his crew dropping like flies around him - in the space of a few weeks he has lost many more men than in the first two years of the journey, in itself a testament to his belief that fresh food and water were the keys to keeping a healthy ship. <br /> <br />All in all, a very good read.	2005-01-07

In a string of seemingly normal workday events, and almost in real time, she drops tantalising hints here and there, which may or may not impinge on the plot, giving one a sense of impending climax, like a gathering storm, with all the clues massing together to erupt in a welter of ... something, but you have no idea what it could possibly be, although there are plenty of possible scenarios hinted at.<br />This is one of those books that drags you along, reading faster and faster, til you have to stop for lack of mental breath. Then straight back into it to try and decipher exactly what the climax will be...<br />Using a similar scenario to 'Doomsday Book', Joanna is based in a hospital, researching Near Death Experience, the 'White Tunnel' syndrome. The obnoxious unscientific Dr. Mandrake, the von Daniken of NDE, generally reaches recovery patients first and runs roughshod over their memory of the event in order to promote his own dubious \\"There, that proves it!\\" theory, to the detriment of Joanna's research. Her researches are constantly stymied by him, plus half her subjects are loonies, and her lack of confrontation and control makes matters worse - you really want to shake her, telling her to get in command of the situation.The consequent lack of suitable subjects means she has to adopt an unconventional approach to record the experience better...<br />I feel as though I should be doing a deeper review to do justice to the book, but that would mean giving away too much of the plot. Suffice to say that this is one of the better sci-fi / metaphysical novels that merits a much wider audience (it helps if you are a film or literature buff) - kept me on tenterhooks for days.*****	2003-06-11

'Popular Science' has a slightly pejorative ring to it that is undeserved, as good examples serve to increase general awareness and dispel urban myths - this book is one of those good examples.<BR>Written in Mr. Winchester's energetic, entertaining style, this book is well-researched and peppered with neat little snippets of information and pertinent anecdotes, backed up with solid evidence. <br />He goes into much historical detail about the East Indies and its importance in world trade and politics during the run-up to the cataclysmic explosion that devastated the island. <BR>One quibble; in extolling the virtues of Batavia, he forgets that the place was reviled by seamen in the 18th C (Anson, Cook, Dampier, Davis et al) as a suffocating hell-hole of disease, stench and filth.<br />He examines the explosion of scientific theories that arose in the aftermath of the event, and the small part he played in proving that plate tectonics works (the chapter on The Wallace Line contains the most lucid crash course on plate tectonics I've seen). <br />Most of this has been said before, but the difference here is he attributes the area's political and religious changes directly to the explosion.<br />Some of this information seems extraneous to the main thrust of the book, (e,g, Wallace and Darwin), but it has a purpose ... It serves to underline the tremendous, slow forces that drive plate tectonics (unheard of then), and the devastating results of any blockage.<br />Given all this background data it should come as no surprise to learn that Krakatoa has exploded many times in the geologically recent past (60,000 years), and most assuredly will in the future.<BR>Eruptions are an everyday occurence, but this gigantic 'throat-clearing' was the first global-scale event to be reported within minutes of it happening, and Mr. Winchester draws on many first-hand accounts to describe in horrendous detail the titanic scale of the event.<br />The explosion shook the world to its core,both physically and metaphorically; long-held beliefs of the solidity of the Earth and Man's significance were blown away. Religious and scientific establishments had to re-think their stances; but amazingly, some still clung (and cling now!) to the old immutable doctrines, even in the light of such solid evidence.<BR>The sterile islands that formed in the wake of the explosion were a clean sheet for Nature, and observations of new life colonising them became the new focus of scientific study, in a less human-controlled way than E.O. Wilson did in the Florida Keys.<br />As with most of Mr. Winchester's books, this is a very instructive and entertaining read, thoughtfully & thankfully containing an appendix on further reading, which I recommend to any popular science/history fan. *****	2003-06-08

The same cannot be said of other members, or the organiser, who couldn't organise a binge in a brewery.<BR>Accusations of cheating from a rival deflate morale so much, they are in danger of missing the favourable winds.

On the run, even 4th luff on the Indiaman looks an attractive prospect, with the chance to make money and a name for himself, but as they arrive in Calcutta, the past catches up with him.<BR>He is thus privy to news that the rest of the young officers are denied, causing jealousy and unrest in the gunroom.<br />Mr.Lambdin strives to convey accents with a quaint use of spelling and punctuation - it usually works, but sometimes is a trifle heavy going. Otherwise, apart from one or two slips, the plot rolls along very nicely. There is initially markedly little naval action - but there is plenty of intrigue and double-dealing to keep one guessing all the way through. However, when the action does start, the below-decks detail is extremely well described, educating the reader in the minutiae of the proceedings.<br />I am not fond of the detailed amorous interludes, which do nothing for the plot, only rubbing in the fact that Alan is human and prey to all the vices that the world has to offer, to my mind a subtle hint works better than a blow-by-blow description which easily turns salacious if not handled well.<br />Having read most of the other authors in this genre, I can say that Mr.Lambdin is definitely not near the bottom of the list - as I read more, he may rise alongside Richard Woodman, James Nelson &amp; Patrick O'Brien in my estimation.	2003-05-19

A young man, obsessed with clouds and their formation, makes a detailed study of them. All this has been done before, but never in such a concise, visionary way, nor with a naming convention as brilliant in its simplicity, expressiveness and utility as Luke Howard's.<br />His story is dealt with in a series of chapters that digress from the main thrust of the book to outline the history of the philosophical changes that were taking place, in Europe particularly. Almost any cockeyed idea found a ready audience, who were equally ready to dismiss ideas out-of-hand. The trick was presentation. Many of the famous names in science at the end of the 18th century were showmen, financing their researches by giving displays or private shows... getting your name known was half the battle.<BR>Luke Howard was born into a world where being in the right place at the right time meant more than any social connections or political clout.<BR>But, being a Dissenter, he had no formal education, no political clout and no social connections - not much chance for him to get his ideas aired, it seemed. Nor was he a showman - his Quaker upbringing saw to that - so luck, and dedication, came to his assistance.<br />Philosophical societies and journals were in their infancy, and were ready to embrace anyone who could increase membership or circulation. This was the chance, and in an hour-long presentation, young Howard captivated his audience and introduced a naming system for clouds, which is still in use today, 200 years on. This was what meteorology had been waiting for - a standard method of logging cloud formations. This was invaluable too for poets and writers, who suddenly found a new addition to their descriptive vocabulary. Small wonder that cirrus, cumulus and nimbus quickly entered everyday conversation (the Englishman's main topic being the weather).<br />The book is very well written, giving us a feel for the social, political and philosophical climate in the Napoleonic era. By various pertinent descriptions of people and events directly and indirectly connected with Howard, we are introduced to some of the greats of the Age of Enlightenment; but none of it feels contrived or beside the point, nor is it ever boring.<br />This is an enthralling read, illustrating how easily a single person or idea can change the direction and thrust of a science... Well worth reading.	2003-04-04

But even so, it was obviously worth it, judging by the millions who paid that shilling entrance fee to (try to) see the almost 14,000 exhibits on display.<br />The first exhibition of its kind to open its doors to the hoy-poloy, it succeeded admirably in its intent to show the general populace (and the world) the fruits of British (and international) industry - its singular failure being the exclusion of Babbage's difference engine. Although a gaggle of nay-sayers warned that it would end in tears (popular opinion of HM Gov. was not at its best just then), it all went swimmingly, increasing Prince Albert's standing in the eyes of a population who had largely had their fill of four less-than-satisfactory Teutonic monarchs.<br />By stages, we see the design, construction, and inauguration of the palace, meet the prime movers of the concept, see some (obviously not all!) of the more interesting and bizarre exhibits, then the decline and cataclismic death of the palace in the great fire of 1936.<br />A most entertaining and instructive read, enhanced by the addition of portraits, diagrams and contemporary colour plates. *****,	2003-02-23

To do this he had to research the probable type of boat that Brendan used, and try to extrapolate a likely route from the very obscure 'details' in Brendan's writings.<br />Having established that the most likely vessel was a curragh, he had to gather the raw materials and a team of experts to construct it in the traditional manner. The tale of how he gets his experts is worth the price of the book in itself! The man must have the luck of the Irish to have everything fall so neatly into place (after a discouraging start).<br />The unravelling of fact from fiction (or our interpretation of fact as fiction...?) took many long and painful hours of studying texts and maps. Given that latitude and longitude were strangers to Brendan, only the vaguest hints of distance and direction were available to Mr. Severin. However, a plausible map of Brendan's route was cobbled together, taking prevailing winds, tides and leeway into consideration. <br />Armed with this, and a more than serviceable boat, the bold explorers ventured forth.<BR>I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by going into more detail. Suffice to say that almost everything that Brendan described is accounted for by natural phenomena - giving the lie to those academics who dismissed the voyage as a figment of a monk's fevered imagination.<br />A very enjoyable read, with Mr Severin's usual hearty enthusiasm pulling you along with him. *****	2003-02-23

However, this is not unpleasing or intrusive, rather, it gives the book an appeal that it may have lacked if told in the third person as a story, rather than as a biography. It also enables him to speak his mind (as old men do), rationalising his youthful actions as 'justification' of the end result - the greatest invention since the wheel - and at the same time decrying those who wished to benefit unjustly from his industry.<BR>Worst of all, he fears that the name of Gutenberg would be forgotten forever, with others claiming the work for themelves - we, as readers, know this is not the case and the old man can rest easy.<br />The bones of the book are true - there is some information on Gutenberg's life - but the bulk of the tale is necessarily invention by the author. <BR>Nevertheless, that invention has the ring of truth - one can imagine these things influencing the mind of the young Gutenberg and spurring him to devise his later modifications to the printing process - specifically moveable type - that were to change the human world for ever, despite severe opposition from the church and others.<BR>Perhaps the most outstanding point that comes across is the cost of books in those times; a Bible cost several year's wages - after all, that's the time a scribe took to write it - Gutenberg's invention reduced the cost radically and ensured consistent quality, no mistakes, an unlimited supply and, more to the point,  affordability ... to the Church this was the very essence of hubris and heresy, if not devilry! Thank goodness their narrow minds did not prevail.<br />A very pleasant  read.***.	2003-02-23

Since then I have become a fan of Mr.Severin's work - he is a dedicated enthusiast, and that comes over loud and clear in his books. He sometimes gets carried away on the tide of his enthusiasm and repeats himself several times, but you can forgive that, as his eagerness and will to learn drag you along with him on his wild dreams.<br />The Sindbad voyage was an attempt to see if a sewn wooden boat could make it to China, using only primitive navigational instruments, in support of a theory of the extent of early Arab trading, considering that the Sindbad legends may have had a basis in fact.<br />The boat is a hand-made, no-metal reconstruction using traditional Arab boat-building techniques, which have only recently fallen out of favour in preference to iron nails and steel bolts. Oman was used as the base for the boat-building and, given its long history of trading with Africa and India, was deemed to be the best place to start the voyage from - the boat's name 'Sohar' comes from one of the major towns on the nothern Omani coast. <br />Extensive research went into finding the best materials, techniques and above all, locating artisans who still knew something of sewn boats, and people who could still handle sails. The description of that quest and the actual building is a pleasure to read - Mr. Severin's infectious enthusiasm communicates itself through the pages to the reader. <br />The voyage itself is a tale of acclimation to strange food, cultures, and heat, the camaraderie that grows between vsstly different cultures, and relief that the boat survives all that the weather can throw at it, with an ease that a more rigid construction would have complained at. So strong is the boat that it still stands today on a roundabout outside the Al Bustan Palace Hotel in Muscat, as beautiful as ever.<br />I've read the book several times and it still comes across asfresh as the day I first picked it up. Enjoy! *****	2003-02-23

Modelling Sailing Men-of-war<BR>Never seen anything better!<BR>This book traces the progress of the construction of Majestic, 74, each step in the various stages is meticulously photographed in close-up, with the work actually in progress, and fingers or rulers giving a visual guide to scale.<BR>The first chapters describe Mr.Reed's background, his workshop &amp; tools and the reasons for his choice of scale and model.<BR>Then the book takes us, in logical, but not necessarily chronological order, through the planning and construction process. Mr Reed favours a solid, excavated, then planked hull in preference to a built-up hull, as it was a commissioned project; this certainly saves time and effort, is more robust and looks more lifelike than the exposed interior of admiralty-style models.<BR>In the text accompanying each photo (typically 4 per page), the author describes each process and gives hints and tips along the way. Some things I would do differently, but there are some interesting techniques used which I shall definitely adopt. The section on ship's boats is particularly helpful.<BR>In the middle of the book are colour photos of the finished model, at anchor in a carved sea, surrounded by several bumboats - this looks so lifelike at first sight, one does a double-take! It is only the figures in the boats that give the game away - and they were not made by Mr.Reed!<BR>I heartily recommend this to any amateur modeller, as a perfect teaching aid and inspiration to tackle bigger, more complex models.	2003-01-18

It makes no pretence at describing the different sizes of rigging and blocks (other books provide that info), but it does tell you exactly where each line is attached, which blocks it runs through, and, most importantly, where it is belayed ... in full-page, easy-to-understand line drawings, with all extraneous detail removed, and call-outs showing which is what. As one browses through, it all becomes clear ... rigging is not arbitrary, there are rules, and they make real sense when presented in this accessible manner. <BR>The body of the book has ONE page of text - the rest is ALL graphics - brilliant!<BR>In another review, I complained about that book's lack of clarity on belaying-points; this book tackles that problem in spades!<BR>Anyone requiring a book on accurate routing of running and standing rigging need look no further - gets my 5 stars!	2003-01-18

A young lad is inspired to draw ships by a challenge from his friend's mother - this developed into a life-long passion and in this book we see the results of that passion. 91 exquisitely-drawn pictures of historic craft from the 13th to the 19th Century are just part of this man's production - would that we could see more.<br />The detail is amazing; all the stays, halliards, sheets and braces are all in the correct positions; the rake of masts, type of tops, position of gunports etc. is accurate. All this is the result of years of travel and visits to museums, libraries and naval archives, in order to portray the heyday of sail as accurately as possible.<br />Arranged on facing pages, text by Stephen Howarth on the left, drawing on the right, this is the best collection I have seen in print.<br />Much of the early data is lost so the drawings of those ships must necessarily be educated guesswork, but generally speaking, if it looks right, it IS right ... and these do look right.<br />It is fairly unusual to see orthoganal views, normally they are side-on, but a good portion of Mr.Wheatley's drawings show the vessel in 3/4 profile, which gives a much better view of the whole aspect of the ship.<br />A pricey book, but a delight to the eyes and an inspiration to the amateur artist or modeller.	2003-01-17

A well-written, well-argued treatise on the volatile subject of the evolution of new species by natural selection. At the time, this flew in the face of accepted theories, and especially upset current theological doctrine, Archbishop Ussher would be particularly upset!.<br />Darwin agonised for years over the publication of his book, and it was only at the urging of his friends (that he was about to be upstaged by Wallace) that he finally published. The delay was of his own making - torn between the evidence of his notes and correspondence with Wallace, and the furore that would inevitably result. The furore was bound to happen anyway, surrounded as he was by small-minded [people], so he should have published earlier. But ... this might have deprived us of the brilliant arguments he puts forth in support of each section in the book. <BR>He obviously knew what he was up against, so he tried to present his case as lucidly as possible - and here's the unusual aspect of the work - in layman's language! This was almost unheard of in a Victorian Scientific treatise - they were meant to be read by Scientists, not the hoy-poloy! He tries to counter every conceivable objection to each statement, as nicely (in both senses of the word) as possible, without any of the fervour and tunnel vision that one expects from a convert to a new ideal. He takes us by the hand and gently walks us through the evidence in support of his theory, helping us to realise that, yes, he is talking sense, no matter what our pre-conceptions of life might be.<BR>Discover for yourself that evolution is not 'survival of the fittest', but 'survival of the most fit' - that is, fitted for that particular ecological niche - fittest being a Victorian word that has taken a different modern meaning.<br />An amazingly good read, even for our enlightened times, but recommended reading  - I'll bet there are hundereds of copies on dusty bookshelves that have never been read - time to dust it off and find out for yourself the genius of the man.	2003-01-17

A young naturalist sets out to single-handedly explore the Amazon basin in the mid-19th century, his only help being Indian guides and interpreters.<BR>This book is so refreshing after reading other travelogues that are either too introspective or full of overblown hyperbole. Mr.Wallace is, I admit, a favourite author of mine, but there is nothing partisan in my praise for his writing ability; in another, later, book he says he is no writer, but his minute descriptions of people, places and environs conjures up mental pictures almost as good as a video. He doesn't over-elaborate points, but describes them so well that any more words would be superfluous. Having read Humboldt's descriptions of the same areas, I know whose I prefer - one can almost smell the soil and foliage. <BR>Reading the book today, there is something a little disturbing in the casual way he shoots everything that crosses his path to add to his collection, but when we consider the alternative of drawing and measuring each item on the spot (no cameras then) and the hyper-abundance of animal life in the forest at that time, it is no wonder he takes the easy option. There was no environmental crisis nor any need for species protection in those days - an area the size of Europe was governed from a town of 15.000 people! <br />He poses some questions that underpin the theory of evolution by natural selection, and it is interesting to observe first-hand the mental process of trying to understand why and how different species became adapted to a particular shape and lifestyle. Wallace and Darwin corresponded and independently arrived at the same result, which culminated in 'The Origin of Species' (also recommended); although Wallace had doubts about the completeness of the theory, believing in a higher authority which lent a helping hand now and again - reminding us a little of the modern-day clash between Gould & Dawkins.<br />A great example of good travel writing *****<BR>This review refers to the original 1889 copy.	2003-01-17

For many years there have been theories proposing that China discovered the world before Columbus, Magellan, Tasman et al. Now, following Louise Levathes' ground-breaking work 'When China Ruled the Seas', Mr.Menzies has drawn on her researches, supplementing them with his own material and, using his specialist nautical and navigational skills, has expanded our knowledge of Chinese exploration immensely.<br />15 years of devoted research has produced a hefty book, which is nevertheless very readable, split into manageable chapters and sprinkled with illustrations, with some fine colour plates. The political intrigue and the maneouvring that went on within the complex Chinese court reads like a novel at times. Then it becomes a detective story; piecing together the evidence of ancient maps and standing stones, a realistic and very plausible theory of the track of the 1421 voyage emerges.  However, as others have noted, he does convert some tenuous relationships into apparent fact, but admittedly without the tunnel-vision of von Daniken.<br />Much of his findings are surmise, backed by a healthy dose of extrapolation and hunch, but the circumstantial evidence is very convincing. This is Mr.Menzies forte, as we see apparently useless maps converted into the real thing by appropriate adjustments for currents; then we smack our foreheads and, with 20/20 hindsight,  say 'Of course, how silly not to have seen that before!'. <br />As we have virtually no records from China - the Ming ruler having expunged most of the records of ship construction, voyages made, lands discovered and tributes collected - it is very difficult to establish the facts in the voyages of Zheng He. But some evidence is hard to refute; for example, Chinese porcelain found in South Africa and Australia, wrecks of junks (which could only come from that dynasty) discovered in far-away places...    <br />... BR>A very satisfying read. *****	2003-01-16

While this contains almost everything that one could possibly want to know about rigging a British Man-o-war, it is not well- presented. Understandably there is a lot of jargon, that is not my quibble, it is the way things are presented that drags the quality down. Some sections are very well done, but then there are others with tiny little drawings that are frankly confusing. Most books I have seen adopt the convention of bows to right, stern to left, but this book follows no convention, which confuses one at times.<BR>Blocks are well described, but the sizing of them is a mystery - a table relating the size of sheet or line to the overall size of block could have been easily done and made a world of difference.<BR>In particular, the last section on belaying could have been done so much better... There are already plan views of the various rates of vessels, but the descriptions are not even paragraphed; whereas there could have been callouts for each pin or fiferail to make it quickly apparent which line goes where.<BR>The same goes for the appendices on sizing spars, masts etc; App1 is a jumble of words with no attempts at bullets; App2 is tabulated, but difficult to interpret easily, (the axes should be swapped,IMHO).<br />This is an invaluable reference, but better editing would have made it a whole lot more user-friendly and readable. ***	2003-01-04

Swift's iron-fisted reputation precedes him and the few hands that man the boat are supplemented by the dregs of the gaols and hospitals, plus whatever he can drum up. William has to do some of the drumming-up and he tricks a young farm-hand and his sheep into the service of HM the King. A smuggling cutter provides a few real seamen, gaining Bentley extra kudos and inflating his already swollen ego, simultaneously earning him enemies in the crew. Young, gullible William is so impressed with uncle's regime that he is in danger of becoming a carbon-copy (which is exactly what his uncle wants). His uncle's charisma blinds the young man to the real dangers of the rule of the lash and starter, and also to the Captain's gradual spiral into madness. However, some of the crew are not blind to this and are planning mutiny, fuelled by the daily bloody punishment, the vile food, incessant meaningless sail evolutions and the prospect of a trip round the Horn at the worst possible season. <BR>Around the same time, Will's bubble of confidence and superiority is pricked by a humiliating staged fight, and more leaks out as he realises the mutinous results of Swift's despotic reign could have been prevented by a different form of man-management; young Will suffers a horrendous coming-of -age in the last few pages.<BR>Rich characterisations, attention to detail and a well-paced plot make this a great, if at times stomach-turning, read - this is realism, so don't expect a happy ending.	2002-12-24

The loathsome Santhonax appears again to quiz Nat and do more dirty deeds as the book closes.<BR> <BR>Trafalgar forms the high point of the story, with Nat only able to view the carnage from the orlop of the French  'Bucentaure' 80, where he was transferred as prisoner with little Gillespy.<br />We see more of the character of Mr.Q, Mr. Frey & Lt.Rogers in this book as well as more of the strategy of the defence of Britain, as Nat becomes more accepted by those in command. A small reference in a letter from his wife, tells us that Nat has fostered poor little Billy Cue Maxted, the Mid whose legs were blown off in the action with 'Requin' off Greenland (in the previous volume 'Corvette'). This touching generosity, the tenderness he shows to little Mr. Gillespy and his encouragement of Mr.Frey reveals a different side to the cool, collected tactician we normallysee.<BR>Mr.Woodman's writing gets better and better with each story - more fluid and confident, yet providing another level of suspense under the surface; meanings are implicit rather than  voiced; inferences made by subtle suggestion rather than bald statement,  which makes this a real pleasure to read.<BR>As good as the best in the genre. *****	2002-11-05

England 1817, and an effete young artist is accused of the rape and murder of the wayward wife of a powerful man - the only possible sentence in these times is the gallows; but his mother has influence and secures an appeal, so as a palliative, Captain Sandman is hired to 'investigate' - i.e. confirm the Court's decision.<BR>Unfortunately, Sandman is a man of principle, and he smells a rat - so when the apparently open-and-shut case proves to be more than it appears, he only has 6 more days to snatch the artist from the hangman.<BR>However, he is less than qualified to achieve this goal, his only assets being his breeding, an explosive temper and a sense of justice. Not much ammunition, especially as the conspiracy involves some very vindictive and influential people.<br />The story rattles along at a great pace, with plenty of intrigue, mystery and sub-plots, some romance and a good grasp of the mores and values of Georgian society - as one would expect from someone with Mr. Cornwell's portfolio. The suspense of the last chapter is nail-biting and also ties up some annoying apparent inconsistencies in the plot<BR>.<BR>As usual with Mr. Cornwell's books, the historical facts behind the fiction, along with some other interesting references, are outlined in an appended note.<br />An excellent read; highly recommended. *****	2002-11-05

Using the original format of 'The Origin of Species', Steve Jones elaborates on Darwin's point with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and all the ammunition that modern science can provide.<BR>Prof.Jones claims his writing could never match the concise brilliance of Darwin's original, but he is plainly wrong, as is clear from the first chapter; the pace is never turgid, it flows with a conversational ease and the explanations are quite simply brilliant - it takes real skill to convey an exotic technical point into layman's terms without resorting to jargon.<br />Professor Jones argues that there can be no more polymaths, as too much information exists now - but he defeats the argument by his encyclopedic knowledge of his subject and how it affects all spheres of life. The interesting and obscure snippets that he relates, and the little-known consequences of actions speak volumes for evolution, and man's hand in accelerating or stifling it.<br />He refers often to genetics (after all, that is his field of study), but that very science has done more than anything else to turn the theory of evolution into as near a law as is possible. Armed with this evidence he shows little sympathy for those who cling doggedly to a creationist or Ussherist biblical  view of life.<br />One of the best examples of evolution played out in industry is his description of soap powder nozzles and how to improve them by natural selection. Man's breeding of dogs proves how far one can go with un-natural selection in just a few hundred years; think what could happen in a few million!<br />A wonderful read, full of humour and wit, with a wealth of interesting information and mind-expanding explanations.<BR...	2002-11-05

I say 'action' but there is remarkably little of it for the bulk of the book, more delaying and prevaricating, despite the presence of Lord Nelson. A personal undercurrent pre-occupies Nat, who uses his previous clandestine life as a cover - the on-board speculation is handled very nicely.<BR>Having said there is no action is misleading; the very lack of progress to action causes unrest in the ranks (and higher command), showing how lack of purpose and conviction, or unfitness for the task can severely jeopardise an operation, causing unnecessary loss of surprise, ships, and men. This is well-told, without losing one's interest as the various strings of the plot are drawn together, culminating in the final bloody action.<BR>Altogether a gripping thriller topped by a detailed factual description of a complex naval battle.*****	2002-10-31

Like many noblemen, he used his money and leisure time in esoteric pursuits, such as collecting flora & fauna and trying to find the deeper meaning of it all.<br />This particular volume has been well-translated from the original - there is none of that stilted 'I haf von the Cherman translated been' style - it reads conversationally (assisted by the editing-out of long passages where Humboldt takes one of his many diversions) yet it also gives us an idea of what the man was really like. There is an extensive set of notes at the back, not just references, but elaboration of the point, which I found very illuminating.<br />His travels to South America span 5 years, during which time he collects and measures EVERYTHING - for at this time in history, no-one knew what was going to be pertinent or useful to science or economy. There are some amazing descriptions where he was the first educated person to see places; the problems of travel in uncharted, trackless & mountainous country make terrific reading. We may scoff at the zeal of the man, but if Hiram Bingham hadn't done the same, we wouldn't have the fantastic ruins of Macchu Picchu to study.<br />We also learn of the relatively tight circle of 'scientists' at that time - almost everyone knew everyone else, either via letters, Society writings or personal contact - and they knew it all; there was as yet no division between geology, biology, zoology etc - it was just 'Natural Philosophy' and one studied the lot (of course some dedicated themselves to a favourite pursuit). What is amazing to us now is the most simple things were unknown; for example, a sailor at death's door deep in the bowels of the ship, 'miraculously' recovers when taken on deck, out of the fetid miasma of the orlop - well, who wouldn't?... There are many similar incidents.<br />Slightly heavy going at times, because of the writing style of the period, it is nevertheless chock full of interesting snippets and amazing discoveries, giving a great insight into the mind and motives of a typical adventurous philosopher of the time. *****d, it is nevertheless chock full of interesting snippets and amazing discoveries, giving a great insight into the mind and motives of a typical adventurous philosopher of the time. *****	2002-10-31

As first novels, these are almost as subtle and enigmatic as P.O'B's later works, but just as gripping as his early stuff; similarly based on historical fact, they are definitely a cut above the rest. Excellent descriptions of below-decks and battle actions take you right inside the ship; an acquaintance with nautical terminology helps, but is not vital, to understand the gist of the action or the day- to-day management of the ship - e.g. the handling of sails is particularly well-described, far better than any other book I've read. and succinct descriptions of wind, weather and tide preface each event; the stage is already set - action soon follows.<br />The hard life below decks is brought horrifically home in the first few pages - the impotence of the younger gentlemen in the face of overbearing bullying is brought sharply into focus, as is the rough justice of the foremast jacks - stark reality is served up in healthy measure here, with a side salad of intrigue and a dressing of young love.<BR>None of the incidents or fortunate strokes of luck seem contrived, rather they develop naturally as Nat matures from innocence into almost cynical youth.<br />Read the following books - they get better with each tale. *****	2002-10-30

This was a time of the greatest change that Britain had ever seen; canals, metalled roads and railways improved communication and access; mechanisation and imports undermined the traditional workers' jobs; a series of wars caused a terrific drain on the economy; expansionism was pushing back the boundaries of the Empire; and the Government was beset by constant calls for reform. Little surprise that the Army had its hands full, both at home and abroad, with the consequent need to increase its strength and change its mode of operation.<br />Written for readability rather than minutely describing the trappings of  military dress, it succeeds admirably - we get in a few paragraphs a potted history of the major military (including naval) actions in the Georgian era - the rest of the book is dedicated to specific aspects of soldierly life, for which Prof. Holmes gets his information first-hand from letters and memoirs of the common soldier, as well as from the officers - both are quoted freely. But it goes beyond the bounds of military life, to describe the many outside influences which affected how the Army was recruited, clothed, fed, trained, punished, doctored and entertained.<BR>Very readable, full of anecdotes, and probably the best condensed history of the period, both social and military, that I have come across.  A must for any fan of military fiction. *****	2002-10-28

Essentially a story of the historic round-world trip of the Graf Zeppelin, it evolves into a concise history of the Zeppelin dirigible industry and the men who made it happen against all the odds.<BR>Brilliant description and narrative flow combine with meticulous research in praise of what was arguably the most impressive man-made sight in the skies - ever. However, we are constantly reminded of the economic facts that this could never be a long-term solution to mass travel. On most flights the crew outnumbered the passengers, there were no schedules to speak of, ground crews numbered in the hundreds and only the very wealthy could afford the expense of the trips. Eckener was not fazed by this - his dream was to use the airship to relieve economic hardship, facilitate scientific research and promote political harmony.<BR>And, we read between the lines of the love that Dr. Eckener (and Mr. Botting) have for this beautiful form of air-travel; it pours from the page in the transcripts of newspaper reporter's accounts, in the tumultuous reception that these great airships had at every arrival, in the awe of the primitive people of the Sahara and Siberia. <br />The sad thing is that these giants never really achieved their promised sovereignty of the skies - sadder still is the Epilogue which hints at the resurgence of German airship industry in the Cargolifter enterprise, which is now in receivership.<br />Nevertheless, a rivetting read and a fascinating insight into a breed of men (and a woman) who persevered in promoting a wonderful dream.	2002-10-25

But that is what the book is all about anyway, so we accept it. What is harder to accept is the lack of flow to the story; I found myself re-reading passages, just to fix the plot in my head, which detracted from the enjoyment. This is aimed at the young adult market, who I suspect will not be prepared to put up with the lack of readability.<br />But, persevere and you will be rewarded with what is ultimately a novel, heart-warming fantasy, which reminded me somewhat of William Nicholson's 'The Wind of Fire' series.	2002-10-04

Immaculate research and superb translations from Spanish archive material turn this into both a scholarly research vehicle and a concise history of the Spanish colonies and the Treasure Fleets.<BR>A good part of the narrative is in the words of a Spanish Padre sent out to Chile to minister to the colonists; this tells us first-hand of the vast mountains of silver that were being exported from South America, and of the nepotism, greed, dishonesty and cowardice that seems to be the product of any get-rich-quick scheme - and Spain had more than its fair share in the 16th & 17th Centuries. The rest of the story is supported by  quotes from sailors and court officials, while Mr.Horner fleshes out the story with historical facts and some surmise - the many notes are detailed as appendix and are not intrusive, while there is other useful information contained in other appendices.<br />Our Padre seems unusually unlucky in being shipwrecked twice, and on the way home the fleet is ambushed in sight of Cadiz and he, along with two ships and 4 million pesos (38 cartloads!) are captured in a brilliantly described battle that Hornblower would be proud of. <br />However, he lives to tell the tale; his memoirs are so detailed that we have a better idea of the actual wealth contained in the treasure fleet than the manifests admit - also the position of the wrecks is so well decribed that Mr.Horner was able to locate the sites and recover valuable artifacts (and of course, silver).<br />As a bonus, we are treated to a superb description of the daringly successful 1657 British attack on the treasure fleet holed-up in Santa Cruz, in which the whole Spanish fleet was destroyed, with the loss of no ships and only 60 men on the British side. This effectively crippled Spanish hopes of sea-rule and bankrupted Seville.<br />The final chapter warns us of the perils of dealing with the red-tape and gung-ho journalism that inevitably accompanies any salvage, not to mention the thievery when there is treasure involved.<br />A very worthwhile read. ****	2002-09-29

He has no option but to beach his beloved boat, rather than be captured, especially as his sworn enemy Smeaton is aboard.<br />All the characters are fully-formed now and we reap the benefit of understanding their actions and their foibles; I think Smeaton is excellently portrayed - the aristo with a chip on both shoulders and an obsession with finishing Isaac off - he is pivotal in this gripping 'factional' tale of how the British were forced to abandon the occupation of Philadelphia.<br />Again we see Isaac's headstrong character take over and cause him trouble, as he loses two boats in quick succession (though not entirely his fault) and almost loses his wife and his life in the protracted vendetta with Smeaton.<BR>The sub-plot of rescuing and fitting-out the 'Foulmouth' is a great counter to Isaac's stranding and attempt to find her, as the two plots run side by side, interspersed with Smeaton's gradual descent into mania.<br />Although this appears to be the last in the 'Revolution at Sea' saga, I suspect that there is more to come before Isaac is finished with the British - at least I hope for more...	2002-09-29

The opening chapters of this informative book give the history of Cornwall in a nutshell:- the mining, the unforgiving coastline, the wrecks, the climate and the people. Specifically from the mining aspect, we see how the conditions lent themselves to some form of mechanised help with raising tin & copper ore and draing the shafts & tunnels. Newcomen and Watt were the first to provide the engines, but Trevithick saw how these could be improved, much to the dismay of Boulton & Watt, who kept up a litiginous fight against Trevithick for decades. <BR>Trevithick prevailed and also saw that the static engines could be moved around by their own power to the next site, which set into motion the beginning of the railways and motor cars (little realising what this would become in 200 years!).... <BR>This is a well-researched book, with plenty of apposite quotes and comments, but at the same time it is never dull - the story flows like well-turned novel, urging one into the next chapter. The great thing about the book is the way you are constantly kept aware of how new the technology was; and how daunting that power was to those used to the limitations of horse-power. And it reveals the impetuous yet single-minded nature of this ebullient giant who would let nothing stop him in his quest to further Cornish development.<BR>The author opened my eyes to the unsung genius of Trevithick; we all remember Watt as the 'Father of Steam' (he actually hindered progress!) and Stevenson as the 'Inventor of the Railway Engine', but Trevithick made more technical strides - although they were quickly superseded - nontheless, it does not detract from the man's vision and tenacity in the face of opposition from the Patent law and his rivals.<BR>Recommended reading ****	2002-09-11

Then we are treated to remarkably un-jingoistic descriptions of the famous battles of the Napoleonic era, with blow-by-blow diagrams showing the positions of the opposing fleets throughout the action.<BR>My only complaint is that not quite enough space is given to shipboard life, and a little too much praise is heaped on Nelson (after all, that's what Nelson expects....) but not a mention of Cochrane, whose tactics, gung-ho zeal and inventiveness were the epitome of what a  fighting captain should be (at least, in the eyes of the public - and Patrick O'Brien).<BR>However, a damned good show	2002-09-11

I haven't read the first of the series 'Faith', but I definitely will after reading the \\"Fury'.<BR>Much like O'Brien in the running undercurrent of humour; the 'cockney' Indians; the O'Riley brothers; the Hessian Marines & Dr. Franklin remind one of the hoary joke of the 'cur-tailed dog-watch' and \\"not a monent to lose!\\" in their pantomime predictability.<br />Very enjoyable, well-written and informative to one who knows very little of the Colonial Wars (not something we Brits talk about!). This covers the same period as James Nelson's 'Revolution at Sea' saga, although I think that Mr.Parkinson has made more use of fiction here, but to good effect - none of it is beyond the realms of reality. Moreover, he has a good grasp of seamanship and conveys it well (although a map would have been useful to those not familiar with the Chesapeake Bay geography), with vivid descriptions of encounters, plus detailed navigational sequences and sail evolutions.<br />One thing that puzzles... we are given a sketchy background to Dalton's stubborn allegiance to the throne, but it seems to me that an Irishman, falsely accused of treason (amongst other crimes) should have no qualms about fighting the British - I would have expected him to throw in his lot with the Colonials long before now.<br />Well worth reading.****	2002-07-18

A slow start, with Isaac beating himself up mentally after the horrendous pounding and loss of life on the 'Icarus' in 'By Force of Arms'; his agonising about his responsibility to the crew seems to take up the first quarter of the book, with consequent lack of action.<br />However, once convinced that he was powerless to prevent or avoid the carnage, he takes on a new lease of life and embarks on 'the Maddest Idea' - to lay the foundations of a Colonial Navy and rid the American People of the taxes and oppression of King George's dominion, in the shape of HMRN.<br />Factual and believably written, this grips you as soon as Isaac shakes off his depression and throws himself and his tactical ingenuity into harrying the enemy and assisting the nascent war on land - I read this in one sitting.<br />Again, maps and a postscript by the author outline the historical facts behind his fiction, and his first-hand knowledge of square-rig sailing makes this all the more enjoyable. ****	2002-07-18

His crew is a different matter: political pressures force the demotion of Rumstick and the installation of an unknown quantity as 1st Lieutenant, who brings with him an abrasive manner and 30 crew to replace those  who left for the greater attraction and rewards of privateering.<BR>These 30 consist mainly of Southern convicts - including a deadly sea-lawyer bent on causing havoc (and succeeding admirably) - and this combination twice leads almost to full mutiny, only averted by Isaac's charisma and his friends' loyalty.<br />Again, a factual account (outlined in the historical postscript) makes for a great read (one wonders if John Adams was really the obnoxious boor portrayed here?) *****	2002-07-18

This reads more like a novel than a biography, understandably, as it is the basis for almost all of the Aubrey/Maturin series.<BR>The descriptions of the naval exploits almost defy belief, if they weren't so patently true - and the land-based politicking, double-dealing and chicanery are incredible, only to be corrected half a century later in the Great Reform Act.<BR>The intuitive brilliance of Cochrane as a sea-commander is totally at odds with the gullible naivety of his political career; his devout moral ethics made it very difficult for him to ignore wrongs or slights against himself or any defenseless group (specifically Jack Tar), and he carried his attempts to redress the balance to extremes, putting himself in very real danger, both physically and financially.<BR>His moral stance was such that he was abstemious, never had a man flogged, never lied, never used his position to personal advantage and never philandered (although counter claims have been made in that direction, but it is hard to believe that a man made of such high moral fibre would cuckold another man or his own wife).<BR>This brilliance also extended to inventions, all (I believe) of which he failed to patent, leaving the kudos to others; the Admiralty failed him in ignoring his suggestions and it was only off his own bat that the advantages were seen (explosive ships, steam vessels etc).   <br />Mr.Harvey covers all this in a very readable style, elaborating in detail on some of the more important episodes in Cochrane's life, but never boring us. He includes snippets from Cochrane's autobiography, where we see his droll, laconic prose used to great effect (particularly in antagonising the Admiralty against him).<BR>In contrast to Nelson, whose claim to fame was by some very suspect naval maneuvres with huge losses of life and parading himself round Britain & Europe, Cochrane stands out head and shoulders higher, in terms of naval brilliance, invention, support for the underdog, attacking jobbery, and humility. <BR>He deserves to be re-instated as the finest sailor EVER. *****	2002-07-11

A blend of swashbuckling naval adventure and magic combines to make a thoroughly entertaining tale.<BR>The magic detracts slightly from our hero's audacity and cunning, but makes for some interesting scenarios; and the handling of the ships is over-simplified, especially the sailing qualities of square-rigs vs lateens. Having said that, and accepting that this IS fantasy, the story is believable, although our hero, as a pirate Captain, seems out of place with his aversion to alcohol and extra-marital sex, but his moral stand on human rights rings true, reminding one of the real-life Lord Cochrane in the early 19th Century.<BR>Based at sea, this is a slight departure from his Seer trilogy, but he still retains the same basic elements, the brilliant youthful tactician allies with a wizard to make a formidable team. The story feels like 2 books combined into one at the last minute, there is a noticeable hiatus halfway through where one feels that all is lost, followed by an up-beat finale that ends in a surprising high. The scene is set for a follow-up.<BR>I thoroughly enjoyed it - as did my wife. *****	2002-07-11

A blend of Dark Age ignorance, Renaissance inventiveness and the buckle-my-swash of the heyday of Sail combine to make a great read, but it's not that simple .. Imagine a combination of Gormenghast, Jabberwocky and the Tales of the Brothers Grimm, with a dash of Deepwoods and a touch of Lord Dunsany - these are the ingredients of a lushly-described tale, the likes of which I haven't enjoyed since I first started reading fantasy.<BR>AND - it has a map - I don't think any book that contains a map has ever disappointed me.<br />A horribly disfigured youth with no memory or power of speech is at the bottom of the pecking order in Isse Tower. However, hidden talents and a desire to be cured of the ugliness take him on a fantastic journey, where the old wive's fairy tales are proven to be true, and where he finds a friend who teaches him to communicate and incidentally discovers an amazinq revelation.<br />The delicious inventiveness of the prose conjures up visions far more tangible than any common words could (as any reader of Lewis Carroll will attest), and the undercurrent of Gothic darkness and spookiness serves to heighten the subtle tension that slowly builds during the first few chapters.<BR>The author has an amazing grasp of folk-lore and also knows her ships and rigging - the descriptions of life and work on board a pirate ship surpass many books in the mainstream nautical genre.<br />As a first novel, plunging straight in at the start of a trilogy, this is an exceptionally fine read - please let the succeeding books be as good! *****	2002-07-04

At least one type of ship was 400 feet long, at the time when Columbus's ships were under 100 - about 50 times the capacity.<br />So what went wrong? What could stop such a powerful naval nation in its tracks? An Imperial Decree - forbidding sea voyages, considering them unproductive, uneconomic and, more importantly, un-Confucian - effectively shut the door on Chinese expansion and fostered the introversion that has only ceased in the last few years.<br />Ms.Levathes has uncovered information hidden for years to present this highly informative and unusual subject in a very accessible form, although I did find the similarity of the Chinese names slightly confusing, which made for heavy reading at times.

What comes across loud and clear was the desperate need for navigation aids on the coast of Britain in the 18th Century; in 1800, Lloyds reckoned they were losing one ship a day (!) to shipwreck - and these are only the ones reported - the true figure, including small craft, was probably many times that. The lighthouses that did exist were coal-fired, inadequate, confusing and extinguished at the worst possible times - in storms.<br />This book does not pretend to be a treatise on all lighthouses, but specifically those built by the 4 generations of the Stevenson family.<BR>It starts unusually with the youngest, and most famous, of the Stevensons - Robert Louis - who had few dealings in lighthouses, nor any wish to; but his experiences and those of his forebears influenced his life and writings, as in 'Kidnapped' and 'Treasure Island' - both concerned with wrecks and dark deeds on lonely islands. <BR>His unfinished family history is a fount of information (and speculation), however, and this is the reason for his place in the book; the main protagonists come next, starting with his step-great-grandfather, who stumbled into the job of erecting a REAL lighthouse (as opposed to the earlier amateur attempts) on the basis of his experiments with lamps... the rest is history.<br />The chapter on the Bell Rock reads almost like a novel; Rennie, the man originally hired to design and build the light, being gradually ousted by Robert, who claims the work as his own - understandably, as Rennie wanted the kudos, but had no desire for the hardship, only visiting the construction 3 times, whereas Robert thrived on it (but was not averse to a touch of glory). <BR>Of course it all ends in tears, with an acrimonious wrangle dragging on for years; but it established Robert as THE lighthouse engineer, winning him new commisions for roads, canals, bridges etc..<BR>His descendants follow in the family tradition (pushed heavily by Robert), keeping to the same basic design of Smeaton's Eddystone light, they erect lights all round the Scottish coast; incidentally gaining the undying hostility of the hordes of wreckers, whose grisly activities were effectively foiled by the lights.<br />Ms.Bathhurst's writing is fluid, assured and informative, never patronisong or descending into scholarly jargon, and, though very well-researched, (see the comprehensive bibliography), does not pepper the text with notes, foot-notes and references - this is after all a Popular History book.   <br />Thoroughly entertaining - highly recommended.*****.	2002-06-16

This wonderful book goes beyond the normal sci-fi book into the realms of social commentary, but without pushing it down one's throat.<BR>The story really makes us think about how we would react, being thrust into someone else's body, unasked and unable to do anything about it, nor could the donor! It questions the rights of parents, doctors, sociologists, scientists to use their power in such borderline cases. The way this is handled is touchingly sensitive and surprisingly low-key for a book aimed at this age-group; it allows the reader to form his/her own conclusions, which generally arrive at the same point that author is aiming for.<BR>The ending is is especially well done and one's heart leaps as Eva makes her decision - good on her!<br />Far better than many mainstream science fiction novels - this rates with the best of Sheri Tepper or Connie Willis. *****	2002-06-15

A string of unfortunate events propel Isaac Biddlecomb from captain of a merchant ship, to wanted smuggler, to foremast jack, then - the ultimate degradation - pressed into service in the enemy's Navy, aboard a hell-ship run by incompetent tyrants. Hopes of escape in Barbados are thwarted by a farcical attempt at anchoring, the subsequent disgrace tipping the unstable Captain over the brink into madness.<br />In parallel, all the elements are coming together for mutiny, both at sea and in the American colonies; this is 1775, just over a year after the Boston Tea Party, and the British blockades and harrying of shipping are stretching tempers to the limit.<br />Biddlecomb finds himself a key player in the run up to the struggle for American Independance<BR>Mr.Nelson does a fine job of weaving the threads of this story into a fine yarn, with plenty of historical facts to back it up. The characters are well-drawn and believable, the writing flows and the action sequences are so vividly detailed, one almost feels like part of the crew.<br />This is book 1 of a 5-part saga, which promises great things. There is action and plot twists right up to the last page, I couldn't put it down. <BR>The author has also thoughtfully included a glossary of naval terms for those readers unfamiliar with the jargon.*****	2002-06-04

Meanwhile, his sworn enemy is intent on destroying all that Marlowe holds dear ... <br />This sets the scene for another gripping tale in the same vein as 'The Guardship' - the same flowing prose and command of language endows this book with the mark of a master storyteller coming into his stride. Many threads, at sea and at home, combine to make this a thrilling, un-put-downable period story.<BR>As the tale unfolds, we are taken into the minds of the protagonists, taking a glimpse behind the facade that each one has created, seeing the tale from several different perspectives, each with its own ideals and agenda, making us more and more involved in this wonderful complex story.<br />Even better than 'The Guardship' - and that's saying something. *****<BR>Look out for 'The Pirate Round', book 3 in the series.	2002-05-23

And our guide is no armchair chronicler either, he was there in the '50s, doing field work in the cold waters of Lough Ine.<br />Incidentally we find that some of our Stars worked in other fields as well; mining, surgery, explosives, writing, biology, photography, cinema, genetics - with the usual humourous anecdote, in case we were inclined to fall asleep (unlikely!).<br />A wonderful, refreshing read - guaranteed to liven up your lungs and your life!	2002-05-17

Some of them are a surprise, being revealed as less (or more, as the case may be) than one's previous conceptions. The populace doesn't suddenly decide they want a change of ruler or government - something prompts it,  and we learn that money (or the lack) is usually the root cause.<br />But the main thrust of the book is the Pound - initially just that, a weight of precious metal, almost useless for normal business, so the economies of scale and convenience demanded an alternative, and also some method of defeating the 'clippers', forgers and money launderers (a long-standing problem, this!).<br />Impeccable research and a flowing style make this an eminently readable and enjoyable book. *****.	2002-05-16

But what a super book - it begins and ends with Mendeleyev, yet in between we are treated to a complete history of the groundwork that went into the discovery and classification of the elements. We meet many famous names, some not-so-famous and a few unsung tyros, along with their discoveries and what led up to them. Many of the discoveries were accidental, others through hard work and the rest by following scientific principles.<br />All of this is far from dull; the author has an undercurrent of subtle humour running through the whole book, making one break out into a wry smile every now and then. The key players in this 'dream' are the names that we remember from school, but have forgotten who they were, what they did and why ... this reminds us and fills in a lot of blanks, as well as fleshing out the characters - why they were like that and how they became drawn ino the field of alchemy/chemistry - some for mercenary gain, others for more esoteric reasons. <BR>We also hear other names not normally associated with Science - Borodin (music), Francis Bacon (plays), Lucretius (poetry) and many more.<br />I shall read more of this author's works, if they are in the same vein as this - a thoroughly absorbing and gratifying read!	2002-05-16

Nor do we get under the skin of any of the characters, there is no fleshing-out of the personalities, so we end up not caring what happens to them.<br />Our Hero Percival stumbles from one lucky accident to the next in true Victorian story-telling style, but there seems to be no central theme to the plot, apart from his estranged father's aloofness and disguised patronage. <br />I kept expecting some surprise or twist in the tale, but only the expected happened.	2002-05-16

I look forward to reading more of Mr.Gaiman's work.<br />...I have recently become more strict with my 'star' allocation.

Time was when every schoolboy in Britain knew about Capt.Webb; matchboxes carried his name and image; he figured high on the list of heroes and tales of derring-do - I'm not sure if the same holds true nowadays, so this book is an attempt to set the record straight (even so, we are surprised to discover that someone had beaten Webb to it ... but not by swimming),<br />Written in an accessible, flowing conversational style, it goes beyond 'the Crossing' to trace the life and exploits of this remarkable man. Incidentally, Ms.Watson (no relation) aspires to be a channel swimmer - this lends a certain authority and credence to the rest of the book; not that it needs it, the research into Webb's life is meticulous.<br />At the time, swimming the channel was as daunting as climbing Everest; many authorities stating categorically that it was an impossible feat. However, Webb seems to have suffered from no such fears - totally confident, he persuades backers with his no-nonsense charm, incidentally laying the basis of the British love-affair with swimming.<br />After the success of the crossing, we see more of Webb's bravado and determination ... but directed into increasingly desperate money-making schemes, culminating in the one that would end his life.<BR>One feels for the man, driven as he was by some inner need, but reduced to exhibitionism instead of taking an easier option on life.<br />A very enjoyable read. *****	2002-05-14

But the rich cast of characters is almost too large to retain in one's head, so one is continually trying to remember who does what and who is allied to whom.<BR>These are the threads of an intricate tale that take their own time coming together to make sense.<BR>I felt as though I had missed something crucial early on, when nothing had really happened after 250 pages, but we are well into the book before the crux of the matter is revealed.<br />All said, this should be a real page-turner, however  I found 2/3rds of it less than gripping, although the story does have a remarkable quality to it that kept me coming back for more.<BR>After page 500, things start hotting up and all the sub-plots start to gel together, coming to a glorious final ... cliffhanger!

It succeeded - and grabbed!<br />This book is deceptively large, due to the small font, tight spacing and thin  margins.<BR>But it needs to be:- there is so much information crammed in here ...  all that the layman should ever need to know about maps & mapmaking, surveyors & surveying and discoverers and their discoveries. My only complaint is that there are no colour illustrations, which would have amplified the descriptions greatly.<br />The narrative style of Pulitzer winner Mr.Wilford makes for easy, yet highly informative reading, taking us from early Chinese maps with their variable scale to modern digital mapping of the cosmos, all the while inserting interesting snippets of fact and conjecture. He draws heavily on other authors (showing the depth of his research), but only to illustrate and augment the narrative. I took longer than usual to read this book, simply because I wished to savour the experience.<br />Required reading for all who wish to know how we came to view the world as we see it now. ...	2002-05-12

I don't think this book deserves the previous scathing attacks ... Ms.Souhami has done us all a favour in this charming book, both Selkirk and the island are the subjects of inquiry. Through diligent research and hands-on experience of the actual island, she conjures up a vision of Crusoe's home which is not too different from the almost idyllic place that Defoe described.<br />With beautiful, almost poetic prose, the island, its topography, streams, flora, fauna and appearance are described with graphic imagery, taking one THERE in one's mind.<br />The explorers (mostly privateers) who used the island as a base are also described in great detail, particularly Dampier, with whom Selkirk sailed. Salutary tales of others marooned, barely surviving, precede a description of Selkirk's own marooning, requested in a fit of pique and immediately regretted.<BR>We see how he lived, not too uncomfortably, thanks to his family trade and experience as a seaman, but there are some lurid tales of bestiality - be warned.<br />We then read, in a protracted sequence, how he is rescued and arrives back in England in glory, then descends into obcurity. His story is taken up and embellished by Daniel Defoe ... The rest is history.<br />Ms.Souhami visits the island and sees for herself where and how Selkirk might have lived and, as a tail-piece, recounts how conservation authorities are trying to restore the island to its pre-Selkirk condition. ****.	2002-05-12

Essentially a portrait of John Larouche, orchid hunter and thief extraordinaire, as well as (surprisingly) supporting the conservation movement, this laconically humorous tale takes us into the depths of the Everglades, the forests of the Far East and the hot-houses of the rich, famous and crooked.<BR>There are some strange asides, that illustrate the type of enigmatic person who goes in for the underworld orchid trade; tales of frog poachers, happy in their slimy occupation; capsicum and bromeliad growers who dump the whole crop in a fit of pique; collectors who also spray-paint pigeons' tails.<br />In all, this reads more like a novel than an investigation into the illegal orchid trade, but loses no credibility for that, rather, it lends a more accessible quality to the book than it would otherwise have.<BR>A very funny, worthwhile read. ...	2002-05-12

Ms.Pavord certainly does love her tulips - the narrative is strewn with latin names for every variety of tulip.<BR>Originally from the middle-east and very different to most other flowers, the discovery of strange multi-coloured hybrids that appeared spontaneously kept  nurserymen occupied for years looking for the perfect specimen. This led to an outrageous inflation in the price, people selling their homes to buy one bulb!<br />Written in a style that fails to hold one's attention, there is perhaps a tad more botanical detail than is necessary for the layman, but when one considers that this is the second book - a corollary to a scholarly exercise - on tulips, it is surprising that so little jargon is used.<BR>Very informative though lacking in story-telling. ***.	2002-05-12

None of the incidents or fortunate strokes of luck seem contrived, rather they develop naturally as Nat matures from innocence into almost cynical youth. <br />In 'The Eye of the Fleet', the hard life below decks is brought horrifically home in the first few pages - the impotence of the younger gentlemen in the face of overbearing bullying is brought sharply into focus, as is the rough justice of the foremast jacks - stark reality is served up in healthy measure here, with a side salad of intrigue and a dressing of young love. <br />I devoured this book in a day - good job I'd already bought the follow-on, because this is addictive reading.	2002-05-05

Where does Hap fit in? Starling is more than she appears; Why is the Fool's horse called Malta? Treasure Beach hints at another connection; Wit &amp; Skill - same or different?<br />By the end of the book, one is left wondering which will be next - a further episode of Tawny Nan, the Liveship Traders sequel, or a new series about the OutIslanders?<br />Ms Hobb has fashioned one of the most believable worlds in modern fantasy - on a par with George RR Martin's Song of Ice &amp; Fire - the characters are 3-dimensional, hidden traits appearing unexpectedly, and not all of them perfect, as so often happens in lesser tales.<br />I can't say much more without 'spoilers', so I leave it to you to persevere with the first part of the book, your persistance will be rewarded!	2002-05-05

This small book does not pretend to be an original work, rather a compilation of accounts and stories from many sources. Written in 1859, it necessarily has that elaborate Victorian style, but is more readable than many others of the same period - which may not be to everyone's taste, but I for one found it utterly charming.<br />There is a wealth of detail contained here, with some mind-boggling and stomach-turning anecdotes, but one should have a good dictionary ready to hand for those common Victorian words which are obscure (not to say obsolete) nowadays:- calapash &amp; calapee (upper and lower turtle meat); lymph (pure, clear water); maw (stomach); quintal (hundredweight); train-oil (whale-oil); rypeu (ptarmigan); phlebotomized (bled).<br />A subtle (but sometimes hilarious) undercurrent of humour pervades the whole book; e.g. re gelatine, &quot;The Americans ... tried to pass off upon us isinglass made of fish bones, but it would not go down&quot; and &quot;the only difference between this and joiner's glue is its greater price&quot;. It is apparent that the author takes a vicarious pleasure in rooting out the more extreme and gut-wrenching descriptions of cuisine and customs from writings by various travellers in remote lands.<br />Overall, this is a witty, engaging collection of unusual (probably useless, but great for quizzes!) trivia that well-deserves this long-overdue resurrection.<BR>If only Mr. Simmonds had lived long enough to complete the companion book of vegetable food curiosities...<br />Gets my 5 stars.	2002-04-18

I've been reading Robin Hobb since she was Megan Lindholm (and now recognised as such); her early books were aimed at a younger audience, but had that certain appeal that set her apart from the run-of-the-mill authors. <BR>The Six Duchy saga is on a different plane, appealing to a more mature audience who wish something to get their imaginations' teeth imto, and she has done it again with the Tawny Man - although it doesn't seem like it during the first 1/3rd of the book ... <BR>15 years have passed since Fitz's last adventure (he is now known as Tom), so the telling of this has to be done subtly, to avoid those boring resumes that we often get; the Fool too has changed in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways and seems intent on being as manipulative as Chade. <BR>The threads that are brought together during the latter part of the book promise an adventure just as good as the other 2, especially as we seem to be drawing both previous series to a common point (which may have been guessed at from the previous frontispiece maps).<br />There are many unanswered questions as well: who or what is the Fool &amp; is it male or female? Where does Hap fit in? Starling is more than she appears; Why is the Fool's horse called Malta? Treasure Beach hints at another connection; Wit &amp; Skill - same or different?<br />By the end of the book, one is left wondering which will be next - a further episode of Tawny Nan, the Liveship Traders sequel, or a new series about the OutIslanders?<br />Ms Hobb has fashioned one of the most believable worlds in modern fantasy - on a par with George RR Martin's Song of Ice &amp; Fire - the characters are 3-dimensional, hidden traits appearing unexpectedly, and not all of them perfect, as so often happens in lesser tales.<br />I can't say much more without 'spoilers', so I leave it to you to persevere with the first part of the book, your persistance will be rewarded!	2002-04-15

John Mandeville's writing of 1370 proved pivotal in the flurry of exploration that followed in the wake of 1492. His assertion that the world was a globe (flying in the face of accepted dogma) and that it was possible to travel by sea to the Far East, was THE incentive that drove the expeditions of hundreds of explorers and merchants.<BR>Later, the book was ridiculed as hokum, but Giles Milton felt there were enough grains of truth in the manuscript to warrant more research, which he does in his usual comprehensive manner. <br />The result is a very readable unravelling of the mystery, shrouded as it was by the interfering pens of earlier 'editors'. Given the extent of the tinkering, we may never know the truth behind the 'Travels', but Mr milton uncovers enough evidence to show that Mandeville almost certainly DID travel to the Levant, but casts doubt on the veracity of his claims to have travelled to the Far East. The latter is understandably not well-researched, given the ambiguity of the literary data and lack of physical evidence, so only 4 stars.<br />However, in South America 300 years later, Drake describes strange people with almost identical characteristics to Mandeville's 'imaginary' creatures - are we being swayed by modern interpretations of medieval descriptions? We may never know, but this uncertainty and the nuggets of truth unearthed by Mr Milton's research in the Middle-East prompted me to order a copy of the 'Travels', so I could judge for myself whether Mandeville was an early Munchausen or a true visionary.<br />A worthwhile read to stimulate your imagination.	2002-04-13
US	52240154	R207MHVMIUYDYK	0201408007	999876295	Nelson: A Personal History	Books	2	7	9	N	N	Sadly disappointed	I have just spent the last 4 weeks, on & off, trying to finish this fairly thin volume; during that time I've read over 10 other books - I think that indicates the readability of this biography.<br />The biographer seems more interested in cramming in relatively superfluous information, with scant regard to punctuation with the result that each sentence ends up even longer than this one and I had to re-read many of them several times to make out the sense of what was being implied.<br />Although meticulously researched, this seems less concerned with Nelson's naval actions and more with his below-the-navel actions. Our biographer seems not to have heard of the Naval Chronicle or Admiralty Papers - the Nile action is dealt with in a page, Copenhagen slightly more, but 2 years in the West Indies occupy less than a page.<br />Nelson & Bronte (!?!) himself comes out of this looking more like an immature, pretentious, love-struck, egocentric hypochondriac than the Great Hero still revered nearly 2 centuries later. On the plus side, it is apparent that Nelson is loved by his men, whom he clearly cares for, (knowing many of them by name) and is diligent in supporting those less fortunate than himself, both with cash and influence.<br />The focus on his tawdry menage-a-trois, stately processions round Britain and portrait-posing does little to foster the heroic image - in effect we are led to believe that the Nile action was won by luck, Copenhagen by bluff, and Trafalgar by a foolhardy tactic... <br />I felt sadly let-down and would prefer a more readable, naval-oriented biography.	2002-04-13

This book shows her to be well-balanced by having chips on both shoulders.<BR>This is essentially an environmental treatise, echoing James Lovelock's Gaia theory, and a blueprint for future co-existance with all living creatures.<BR>No-one is immune from her vitriol:- FBI, DEA, NRA, the law, Forestry, smoking, religion, alcohol, prisons, fertility clinics - all get a slating, and deservedly so.<BR>However, unusually, this diatribe verges on the extreme, and the Alien solution she employs, while being vastly effective, almost seems like another oppressive regime.<BR>I found this less convincing and more trite than her previous books (like 'Raising the Stones') which support the same goals; I felt that things happened too easily, the results too assured and altogether too slick. It struck me as being 'McCaffrey-esque' in the way some of the scenarios are staged.<BR>Still a worthwile read - especially for the Ugly Plague - don't you wish you could serve justice up in a similar way?!	2002-04-11

In reality, he is heir to a vast estate (unbeknown to him) and the convolutions of the tale that evolve from this are wonderfully written; the gradual demolishing of Dawes, the unspeakable duality of Frere, the calculating guile of Sarah and the gullible innocence of Sylvia are woven together in a plot that does not end happily ever after. This I think, serves to underline the barbarism and futility of the transportation system. <BR>Based on actual events, Clarke uses his 'hero' to illustrate the depravation and privations that prisoners (and their guards) had to endure. Graphically showing how degradation degrades and power corrupts, the narrative never dwells on gruesome details, instead it relies for effect on the imagination of the reader, which can be more terrifying.<BR>A book that deserves a wider readership.	2002-04-11

True, the book was dictated to an amanuensis by Margery, but that makes it all the more surprising - dictation generally does not have the flow that one's own writing has.<BR>.<BR>There are some drawbacks ... the book is written with hindsight, and the facts are necessarily clouded by time and memory, but what does come across is that Margery was a sick woman, mentally, physically and spiritually. <BR>She makes it very clear that she abhors the carnal side of marriage, yet dwells upon it at great length, as if 'the lady doth protest too much'.<BR>Her frequents outbursts of wailing and self-abasement come across as an extreme form of PMS or hysteria brought on by self-denial.<BR>Her excessive praying strikes one as an excuse for anything that she doesn't want to deal with normally.<br />As others have pointed out, she was well-to-do, had a thriving business, was not molested by her husband (apart from his alleged sexual demands, which do not seem excessive) yet spends an inordinate amount of time bemoaning her fate and her husband's demands on her.<br />Putting that to one side, there is a lot in this book to make one re-think our views of medieval life and the specifically the role of women. <BR>For a woman to have a good business-head; have her own means of support; dictate conditions of marriage to her husband; travel as and when the mood took her; this doesn't sound like your archetypal medieval goode-wyfe... <br />Maybe this book should be more widely read ???	2002-02-16

The cover of this edition is MUCH better than the one released in UK (which I have)<br />At first, this lovely book seems to read in a stilted, staccato way - but that is soon forgotten as one is drawn into Nick's life aboard the Endeavour, and how he copes with the difference between his imagination and the reality of the harshness of a sailing ship.<br />Although the diary is fiction, Nick Young and all that is described is actual fact (I checked in my biographies of Captain Cook &amp; Joseph Banks). But it is the WAY each incident and discovery is described in the 'journal' which sets this apart from those books; this has the freshness of youth, the wondering mind of an 11-year-old, the lack of 'seen-it-all-before' that an adult has. Nick's views on life as he experiences it will certainly set any young mind thinking on similar lines - for the benefit of us all.<br />I recommend this to anyone over the age of 10, who has a love of adventure and likes to read of real history in the making.	2001-11-20

There are numerous references to the formative cookery writers of the past, many of whose recipes remain unchanged to this day! <br />This is the only book I've seen with such a comprehensive list of ingredients (apart from specialist ingredients books) - almost everything available is described in detail. This list takes up nearly half the book, but is an integral part of it, as it gives one a deeper insight to each ingredient and hence the importance of its use in the recipes.<br />The recipes themselves range from the classic &amp; regional to the obscure &amp; parochial and many are accompanied by delicious photographs that just beg you to try out the recipes.<br />This is the way cookery books should be ... gets my five stars.	2001-11-03

And it shows Elizabeth R. to be both tight-fisted and a spendthrift, depending on who was petitioning or what was the object in view. <br />What comes across loud &amp; clear is the crass ineptitude of the explorers, planners and the colonists ... they picked possibly the worst place on the Eastern seaboard for their first settlement; had barely enough supplies to set themselves up; ignored the example of the natives; were abandoned for years; etc.<BR> <BR>Ultimately, the book is a compilation of stupid mistakes, misplaced trust, unheeded advice, and lack of forethought - all driven by greed for land, wealth and fame. <br />I enjoyed it, but it would have been better with a central theme binding it all together.	2001-11-03

I bought this book on the strength of reading about Capt. Herndon's sacrifice in Gary Kinder's &quot;Ship of Gold...&quot;. He seemed to epitomise the old-style captain, caring about his passengers, crew and above all his ship, and I was interested to read more about the man.<br />I was not disappointed; what could have been a dusty tome full of only facts and figures, emerges as a rivetting account of the trials endured during the trip, and vivid descriptions of a land that was as yet virtually unknown to the 'civilised' world, told as a very readable narrative. This easy style is what captured the hearts and minds of the Anmerican (and European) public in a book which went into several reprints of 10,000s (as opposed to the usual Congress print run of 100+!).<br />It also captured the imagination of a certain Samuel Clemens, who, after reading the book, immediately took steamer from St.Louis to New Orleans to get a boat to the Amazon. Imagine his disappointment when he found no passage ... sitting, bemoaning his ill luck, he hears the cries of the steamers &quot;Mark twain!&quot; - the rest is history.<br />I have one reservation (hence only ****); during his editing &amp; research for the book, Mr.Kinder deletes a lot of sections that I personally would have found very interesting, such as crops grown, goods &amp; minerals available and costs of trade items. If these had been included as an appendix, I think it would have added to the charm of the book.<br />Nevertheless, one of the best pieces of historical travel writing I have ever read.	2001-04-06

Approaching this subject with a preconception of Newton on a pedestal as a demi-god, I felt both let-down and uplifted...<br />Let-down by Newton, because the book gives an insight into the devious, underhand methods he used and how he would ride rough-shod over anyone in the way of his ideas.... Also, I fail to understand how such an intelligent man could swallow all the Alchemical drivel of the time - thousands of years of experimentation and still nobody discovered the Philosopher's Stone... that should have rung a warning bell!<br />Uplifted, because Mr White never lets you become bogged-down in the details of the subject - he injects another perspective at the right moment, letting you see that our 'demi-god' is as fallible as the rest of us. Also enlightening was the fact that Newton was 'in charge' of the Royal Mint at its most crucial point in history.... without his intervention, the British economy could have slid into irrecoverable bankruptcy. <br />Early on we get a glimpse of Newton's leanings (both emotionally and experimentally) and this is elaborated on to give a rounded profile of the man. Given all the pies he had a finger in; the challenges he set himself; and the physical and emotional deprivations he went through, it's surprising that he didn't end up totally insane. We see him on the brink of it, throwing all his principles out of the window, back-stabbing his 'colleagues' and alienating himself by his strange behaviour.<br />A damned good read.	2000-10-01

I'm not sure how to take this book...<br />For a start, I saw the film before  I read the book and it seems very  strange reading the words but having  them appear in your mind's ear  coming from Cary Elwes' or Mandy Patinkin's  lips - normally the book  and the film have very different lines...<br />Then  I was unprepared for the introduction, which seemed to take an   inordinately long time to lead into the main story, mainly due to the   butterfly mind of our 'abridger' - lots of side-tracks and   self-depracating humour (not side-splitting or laugh-out-load, but  wry,  twisty-mouth, snigger humour).<br />The story itself is almost exactly like  the film, apart from a few  extra scenes. If you've seen the film, then you  may not want, or need,  to read it (although I found it to be a useful  addition).  If you haven't seen it, then buy the book; it has the works,  amost  every old-time swash-buckling fantasy adventure element is in there  -  real Erol Flynn stuff this - and it never stops (if you ignore the   Goldman/Morgenstern between-brackets interjections).<br />Funny, camp,  exciting and predictable (yes you can have both at once!) this tale just  carries you off on a ride.	2000-04-28

Without the clues from the  diaries  and memoirs of survivors, plus ships'  logs, and the tenacious convictions  of the  salvor, this story would never have unfolded. As it is, the first  third of the book had me  on the edge of my seat for hours - what a   tension-filled ride that was! I can recommend  the book on the strength of  that story alone  and give it 5 stars. <br />What follows is less nail-biting,  but nontheless exciting, as the clues unfold from information gleaned from  all over the US, patched together by a man with a single-minded ambition to  recover the richest prize ever recovered from the sea. <br />The fact that it  lay in 8,000 feet of water takes up the final third of the book with the  almost insuperable technical difficulties, but we are still left hanging,  for we don't yet know the full value of the prize. The meticulous recovery  methods employed ensured that the treasure was in pristine condition -  other quick and dirty methods  would have been much cheaper and faster, but   would have transformed the coins from 'gem'  quality to 'fine' or less,  depriving them of a  another 2 or 3 times their worth, in a collectors'  market. This market has probably still not been  fully exploited, so there  may still be millions  waiting to be recouped ... and they deserve it!<br />A  bonus is that the story of the ill-fated  Captain Herndon's previous trip  down the Amazon  is to be released later this year (July 2000);   'Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon' written by the same Gary Kinder,  promises to be another spellbinding tale.<br />More like this, please!	2000-04-24

After reading 'Captain James Cook' I now realise how the misconception arose - on his last and most famous voyage,  he presents a Mr.Hyde personality, completely out of keeping with his  previous Dr.Jekyll style of running his ship and dealing with the natives  he meets - little wonder the Hawaiians took revenge (in the worst possible  way). Interesting too, is the side-study of Bligh, who was already showing  signs of despotism and seems to have fostered Cook's decline into cruelty,  autocratic rule over his crew and excessively harsh treatment of the  natives.<br />The author poses the possibility that a medical condition  precipitated this sudden change of character, but it may also have been  early senility, Altzheimer's or dementia brought on by stress - who  knows?<br />The book is full of interesting clips from various people's logs,  which show other views of life under Cook's leadership. The main thrust of  the book is not that Cook was in the right place at the right time, but  that he made such a consummate job of ensuring that the surveys were  carried out in a methodical manner, with a healthy crew and sound ship.  After all, it was HIS decision on what type of ship to use, what food to  keep the crew healthy, how to deal with the natives and his diplomacy that  ensured that the first 2 voyages were such a resounding success. <br />All  this is in sharp contrast to the last voyage, where he allowed the shipyard  to take liberties with the refitting of his ships, the lack of diplomacy,  his cruelty to the natives and his lack of patience with his crew. This  only serves to reinforce what an extraordinary leader he had been.<br />A  splendid read which has furthered my interest in history and exploration -  more like this please!	2000-04-24

An enthralling tale of the most famous vessel  in American history and the man behind its  inception, told with verve and a style that  kept me up way into the night - finishing the  book in 2 sittings.<br />Finely researched  details and verbatim accounts  of proceedings give a fascinating insight  into  the chain of events which drag our designer hero  into the Civil War  as the pivotal figure in the  defeat of the South. It also shows the idiocy   and lack of informed decision-making, as  well as the intelligence which  pervaded the Armed  Services chain of command (probably to this day).<br />The  actual battle is a bit of a let-down after  the big build-up in the race to  complete the  Monitor's construction in time to challenge  the Merrimac's  dominance of the war. It serves  to show how small things can turn the   tide of events against all the odds (see also  Battling the Elements :  Weather and Terrain in  the Conduct of War) - in this  case neither of the  two combatants were badly damaged,  yet the South suffered a crushing blow,  purely  from the knowledge that there was a better power  afloat, and the  Merrimac was scuttled by her own  crew. <br />If you are interested in  History, Industrial  Archaeology or Military Strategy, don't miss this   one!	2000-03-31

As in his other books (Blind Watchmaker, Climbing  Mount  Improbable, etc.) Mr. Dawkins makes your mind boggle at the way nature use  very simple (?) building blocks to fashion something extraordinary ... like  us. You are set back on your heels  when you realise that your body is  largely composed of modified  bacteria, without which we could not exist.  He goes on to expound on  how we see and from there how our brain  interprets the world, comparing  it to Virtual Reality (no comparison!) -  anyone who has experienced  any form of VR will understand the immense  computing power it takes  to present even a half-decent rendition, but the  brain does this  continuously AND has time to dream, imagine, remember past  events  and places all in real-time - I doubt if enough teraflops of   computer power exist in the world even now to do that.<br />The main thrust of  the book is the poetry of science; how, by  understanding more about the  way the universe works, we can  appreciate the wonder of it all the better  - open our minds to  something more beautiful than just the outward  appearance of a  beautiful object - even make us see the beauty in some  not-so- pleasant sights! <br />In this book he uses well thought-out,  easy-to-grasp concepts to  explode myths, de-bunk charlatans, and  de-mystify magic (a little TOO vitriolic at times, I fear!) - all with the  intention of opening our minds to the concept of evolution  (specifically  Darwinism). He takes us from rainbows to barcodes to  DNA in easy stages,  explaining in graphic (but never tedious) detail just how nature can (and  will) evolve all its wonders. <br />Sometimes I had to put the book on one  side just to let the enormity of it all sink in. I still find it hard to  grasp the vastness of time  it required for nature to accomplish all that  it has - yes, I can  imaginea thousand years; a million? ... I'm  struggling now;  a billion? ... overload!  But that's what you need to do  to come to grips with the evolutionary process. I suspect it's this lack of  comprehension / imagination that  is behind the beliefs of many  Creationists, or maybe a refusal to  accept that evolution can happen  without some 'intervention'. Having laid myself open to attack, I can only  recommend that you read  what Mr. Dawkins has to say and make up your own  mind who has the  right of it.	2000-03-27

It took over 25 years for Rinker Buck to get  all this organised in his head, then put it on paper, but it was worth  waiting for.  What we get is the straight story, from his point of view, of  the preparations and the journey, the turnaround in relations between him  and brother Kern, and the two of them dealing with the expectations of a  larger-than-life father who, perhaps secretly, wished to relive fame  through the exploits of his sons. Told against the backdrop of ariel  incidents, we find that the ebullient schoolboy prankster has to take  (literally) a back seat to his shy, reclusive older brother, who suddenly  comes out of his shell. It never descends into maudlin, or goes  over-the-top, it is a straight from the shoulder account of the trip and   the souring and cementing of relationships - a damn fine read.	2000-01-05

More like poetry than prose, some of her  descriptive passages have to be read more than once, just to let the  feelings soak into your system.  Ms Markham's early life is told in a  matter-of-fact way, which takes it for granted that, when at 17, your  father decides to leave Africa for Peru, you jump on your horse and head  North, with no food, one change of underwear, little education, but a deep  knowledge of horses and expect to land on your feet. Which is exactly what  she does, co-incidentally meeting many yet-to-be-famous people on the way.  Hunter; horse-trainer; aeronaut; most people would be happy to excel in any  one of these professions, but Beryl does it all with surpassing ease.  Her  style is self-effacing and matter-of-fact; you would imagine that being  'moderately eaten' by a lion would warrant more than a couple of  paragraphs, but it only gets included here, I suspect, on the strength of  Bishon Singh's wonderful rhetoric in describing the event.  She also has a  knack of striking up instant and longlasting relationships with people from  every race, creed and social status - I don't believe she even saw those  differences; be he a Murani warrior or a colonial Governor, they both get  treated to the same open-minded friendship. A book to read &amp; read  again.	2000-01-05

When I was a lad at school, History was as dry as the paper it was written on - memorising numbers and names for no reason that I could discern. The books gave no insight, the teachers did their best, but it had no bearing  on 'today'. This book is full of dates and names (the lifeblood of  History), but every page is alive with the souls of those people who made  History. Ostensibly the story of Nathaniel Courthope &amp; nutmeg, we are  halfway through the book before we meet him, all the previous pages are  background build-up, in graphic detail, of what made the spice islands and  in particular Run, such a focus of attention for the whole world. We are  taken on a whirlwind journey across the centuries and round the globe, each  chapter heralding the next with a snippet of information, like dangling  bait, so one is eagerly waiting for the next chapter to unfold.    This is  not just a compilation of events and dates, the meticulous background  research that went into this must have taken years; Giles Milton has  studied every scrap of available material, in umpteen languges,  specifically to flesh out the bones of what could have been another dusty  tome. The heroes and villains of the piece are REAL people in this book,  people you want to meet (or avoid!) and they are brought to life by the  fluid style of Mr. Milton's prose - it drags you along with it, urging you  to read faster and faster, ultimately having to stop for lack of mental  breath - then off into the fray again. I cannot praise this too highly - a  revelation for those who thought that history is bunk!	1999-12-31

The subsequent journey to safety of  the eight survivors is recounted by the first mate in graphic detail and  with great literary skill; you have to admire the fortitude displayed by  Mr. Chase in keeping an accurate log, even in the extremes of privation and  heat exhaustion, as well as the psychological assault of that ultimate  horror (at that time) of cannibalism. Put in their position, would I do the  same - absolutely!  It speaks volumes that very little was said about the  Essex party, whereas the Donner party were unjustly vilified for doing  exactly the same thing to preserve the remaining members of their company.  I can do no better justice to this book than to quote Gary Kinder:-  &quot;...settle back into that overstuffed leather chair and let the most  amazing story in the annals of the sea transport you to a different time, a  different breed, an experience few could believe...&quot;.	1999-12-30

I consider myself fairly widely-read, but after reading Mr Wells'  account of why fish are built like they are and how close to the brink  of life/death they live, it really gave me pause to think about how  (most of)  we humans live our lives in absolute, cushioned-from-nature  safety. Never  having to worry about where the next meal is coming  from, nor in a  constant state of alert, waiting for sudden death to come  scooping us up -  whether in the shape of a barracuda or a trawl, it makes little  difference  to Fred Mackerel. I had never sat down and thought about  the energy  balance at such a low level before - the energy trade-off  between a long  chase for a few calories, or sit around on tick-over,  waiting for dinner  to pass by.  We always seem to think of ENERGY on a larger scale (coal,  oil, electricity)  which somehow divorces us from the fishes' problem -  this book made me  take a step back and consider Nature and Her ways in a  different light - marvellous!

To find yourself having no choice but to set out to sea, in the middle of a south polar winter, with the only hope of rescue 800 miles off would reduce most people to despair. It's a mark of the stuff that these men were  made of that they reached their goal, intact, then went back to rescue  their comrades. I find it difficult to imagine how they navigated in those  low latitudes, in a roiling sea, howling gales and limited visibility;  Worsley tells you how... He also has the writers' gift of transporting you  from your comfortable chair to the freezing, wet, cramped conditions of  their boat - and yet still bringing to life the thoughts and feelings of  this rare breed of men. As Olivia Tsosie says, it should be recommended  reading for all teenagers, so they understand what life can dole out and  yet you can still turn the tables on fate, instead of sitting back and  letting life ride roughshod over you.	1999-12-30

Some books stretch the bounds of credulity with unexplained magical feats, but with this book I just didn't care; it makes no pretensions to be other than what it is - a children's fairy story, where anything can and does happen; monsters, giants, shapeshifters, witches, magic, talking animals -  this book has the lot. It made me want to read it out loud to my  grand-daughter, if it wasn't so long! It has that (now) outdated  'story-book' delivery to it that is somehow very appropriate to the plot  and characters; short, descriptive sentences without waffle or padding  convey the gist of the story using exactly the right words and phraseology  - no wading through paragraphs of tortuous description. Brigit steals the  show with her feisty 'I can do anything and I'm not afraid of YOU' attitude  and the other characterisations are so good, you can 'see' each one in your  mind's eye. Ideal material for a film, but I fear that Terry Gilliam is the  only one good enough to do it justice. I loved it - read it with a child's  open mind and you will too - a real joy!	1999-11-26

OK there were some nice touches in there, Audobon  &amp; Balzac especially, but I thought the trial was a bit too glib - I  reckon that the pro-slavery contingent would have just taken over and had a  hanging there &amp; then in real life. But, if Alvin really is the second  coming - I guess that makes it all OK.

A marvellous coming-of-age story; the gradual painful transformation  of a self-centred little guy into someone who cares about his people. Roddy has some redeeming qualities, probably picked up from his mother;  the wiles of  statecraft and an intuitive handling of intrigue. This seems at odds with  the way he handles his personal relationships, but understandable, given  his upbringing. The fight scenes are far better than most - transporting  you into the thick of the melee and leaving you in no doubt about the  horrors of war; something which figures large in Roddy's wish to recover  the kingdom as peaceably as he can. The way Roddy handles the other Lords  &amp; Ladies and gathers them to his cause is one of the best I've read,  and all of this done with a slight touch of humour that kept giving me a  wry smile every so often.<br />Other reviewers have commented on the  homosexuality content, some reading more into the relationship than there  is - where does it say there was any penetration? All he needs is a helping  hand!  If this was left out of the story, bang would go the pivotal point  of Roddy's need and reliance on Rustin to save him from himself and from  losing his virginity. <br />Thoroughly recommended, it kept me up most of last  night finishing it; there HAS to be a sequel.	1999-03-15

This is one of the few books that describes exactly how to make a REAL bolognese sauce and the pasta to go with it. La Nonna (Italian Mother-in-law) was very impressed with the Italian recipes. What I like is  the way the principles are defined, then no-nonsense instructions for a  basic recipe, followed by the variations. Too often, books have the same  recipe in the chicken, beef, lamb sections - basically wasting space and  the readers' time. I especially liked the hints and tips about things that  are never discussed in other books, like frying an egg or making a cup of  chocolate - 'course, anyone can do that - NOT! The author has done a grand  job of condensing almost all cooking recipes/techniques into one relatively  handy volume - this is going to be a present to my daughter (it'll save me  E-mailing all my recipes!). The only failing is a lack of illustrations,  but then we can't have everything. As Dr Butch said; &quot;The enemy of  good is better&quot;.	1999-02-14

I first saw these strips twenty-odd years ago in a comic book my brother had. They immediately captivated me, (despite being initially perplexed by the weird hair and funny hats - then suddenly it all made sense), I tried  (unsuccessfully!) to emulate them and immediately  realized that one needs  the brain of a genius / savant to overcome the problems of creating a  cartoon that makes sense upside down, as well  as continuing a sensible  story.  I told my brother I'd bought him a copy and he was ECSTATIC, as if  I'd given him a crock of gold! Verbeek is in the same class as M.C. Escher  when it comes to creative talent, I'm so pleased to be able to own examples  of his work at long last! Do yourself a favour and get this - it's $10 of  lasting pleasure. Gets my 5 stars.	1998-11-29

The modern vocal style threw me at first, then I assumed that all would be  explained (it is!) and from then on had a wonderful read. There is real  history here, I've been to some of the places, and obviously so has the  author. Some juicy characterisations, a little wannabe sex thrown in, but  not enough to put people off.  Charles, who's to say that the Vikings  didn't bring potatoes back from Vinland? Who cares about the odd 'oops'  with a cracking story like this - more please!  BTW. a dragon is a Viking  longboat.	1998-08-15
US	52240154	RGOZIR3WAXHXJ	0385415117	994553723	Raising the Stones	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The most-read, most-borrowed book in our library - stunning!	Another world, another culture, and how 'we' subconsciously view the cute little natives and well-meaningly interfere with their 'barbaric' customs. Ms Tepper REALLY makes you reflect on how YOU live, how YOU think and how would YOU fare in a situation like this. Each book is mind-expanding in a different way - how does she do it?  More please!!!	1998-03-21
