First off, a Police Commissioner will absolutely not call a 20 year old, wealthy debutante to inform her of various murders.  No way, no how.  We are supposed to believe that she runs around at all hours of the night with a pickpocket kid from the slums and her parents allow her to do this?  Forget that. Then we have wonderful brother, Evan.  He owes $200,000 (remember this is 1902 and this is real money), has a fight with his father, quits his job with his father's company, gets beaten by LaFargue to whom he owes the money, and is going to move to a Fifth Avenue hotel.  Yes, Calder Hart did pay $50,000 of that debt but that still leaves $150,000 owed and he is still gambling every day at LaFargue's gambling establishment.  Now, I ask you, what is he going to use for money to pay his hotel bill, to continue gambling, etc.  Credit cards were not available at that time.  Evan is not a likeable person, is spoiled, immature and needs someone to talk some sense into him.  We are also to believe that Fran's parents allowed Maureen Kennedy and her brood to move into their mansion until she's recovered from her stab wound.  Remember Mrs. Kennedy is from the slums and we're talking wealthy people that live on Fifth Avenue in New York.  Yep, realistic all right.  I know this is fiction but, come on, let's have a little credibility.  Now, we come to the Countess Bartolla who is nothing but an impoverished whore.  She plans on getting Evan to take her to bed and pretend she is pregnant.  Evan doesn't have a dime so how will that help her. Then, there's Rick Bragg who is not a person of high moral fiber.  If I recall correctly he has sired two illegitimate children, his wife, Leigh Anne left him, then came back from Europe because her father was gravely ill; however, she has made an agreementwith Rick to live as man and wife again for 6 months to see if they can work out their problems.  Although Fran was hot for Rick before she found out he was married, she has now directed her attention to Calder Hart, Rick's half brother, who, along with Sarah and Rourke appear to be the only normal people in this series.  Sorry, but my take on this is preposterous, unbelieveable, and we expect more from Ms. Joyce.	2003-04-09

In this day and time why was there no DNA testing.  Seems a grave oversight by the writer. Yes, Deputy Cash Edmunds told his story; however, was he punished?  He was an accessory before and after the fact, several times.  He set the dogs on the girls so that makes him that much more an accessory.  Then there is the statement given by Clare and Evangeline which made the culprits conviction certain.  What about all the bodies?<br />Then at the end of the book is the statement \\"*** incarceration had resulted n the petition grantng custodial guardianship and power of attorney to Frank being given over for review to Judge ***\\".

What I am complaining about are the loose ends that are never tied together.  Sam's father loves him but leaves his vicious second wife and stepson in charge of his estate until Sam, who was 10 years old when he dies, reaches the age of 25 and marries.  If he cared so much for his son he would have left his lawyer in charge of his home and his business. Then Sam signs over the business, after it has been run into the ground, over to his hateful step brother.  Right!  That's just not believeable.  Next, Laura's husband has escaped from jail and wound up in Alaska. Why did the sheriff not take Roy in custody and return him to the pen?  Jason, Charlotte's love, is uneducated and speaks thusly. Then, a week or so after Sam hires him he can speak perfect English and can work on Sam's accounts.  From was previously written I doubt Jason could even read.  Then, there is the fact that Laura started a school for the Indian children and the poor adults on the wrong side of town.  Why did she not start a school for the illiterate children?

Eight years ago Sophie Dane was ostracized by the ton because of leaving London and obtaining a divorce, which was almost a crime back in those days.  She is a companion to Honorine Fortier and after all these years they return to London. Sophie is very uncomfortable knowing she is being talked about by everyone in London.  She meets Caleb Hamilton, the bastard son of Lord Will Hamilton, and they have a secret love affair.  Honorine, meanwhile, meets Will Hamilton and falls in love with him, helping rehabilitate him after apparently having had a stroke.  However, that is not the only thing affecting Will's speech and mobility--most of his problems can be attributed to his legitimate son, Trevor.  Justin Dane, one of the Regents of Rogue Street, and Sophie's brother is a disappointment in this story; however, he does redeem himself at the end.  The Epilogue is one of the very best I have read.  It brought lots of tears to my eyes--happy tears.  This is one of Ms. London's best.	2002-09-04

They have a happy marriage and trust each other or so one would think.  <br />Following the murder of his wife, Beau McGarrity, the dead woman's husband pays a visit to Susanna and implores her to convince her husband that he did not kill his wife. Unbeknownest to Beau Susanna has recorded the conversation and when Beau leaves, Alice Parker, an inept officer knocks on Jack and Susanna's door and Susie thrusts the recording in Alice's hands. Never mentioning any of this to Jack, Susanna packs their girls and goes to visit her grandmother in Boston for a &quot;few weeks&quot; which turn out to be 14 months.<br />Alice Parker is convicted of tampering with the murder scene of the above crime and is sentenced to one year in jail.  When she is released she goes to Beau, tells him about the recording, and tells him Susanna has the recording.  She tells him she will retrieve it for $50,000.  Then Alice goes to Boston, meets Susanna's grandmother,and  becomes friends with her.  All this contrived plot is to lead Beau to think Susanna has the tape and she, Alice, will steal it from her.  How trite.  How unbelieveable.  Susanna finds out about the friendship between Alice and her grandmother and confronts Alice, then she leaves a message on Jacks's voice mail about what is going on.  Jack, of course, flies to Boston.<br />Then everyone goes to the Adriondaks where Susanna has purchased a cabin in the area where her grandmother was born and reared.  The plot thickens, but not much.<br />By the time you reach the end you don't really care what happens.  Jack, it seems, already knew all of Susanna's so called secrets, but the one I like best was that she was afraid to tell him the investments she made for them are now worth ten million dollars.  I'm certain most husbans would be upset to find out they are millionaires or so you are supposed to think.  This is certainly not oneof Carla Neggar's best and I have read them all.	2001-12-31

Marc testifies in the accused's behalf and the case is dismissed.<br />Marc and Josette meet again many years later in San Antonio the year before Josette graduates from college.  They become very good friends and Josette falls in love with Marc.  On graduation night Marc takes Josie to his apartment and tries to make love to her but finds he cannot penetrate her hymen.  He is devastated as he realizes that Josie was innocent in the case when she was 15 and he is devastated, says horrible things to her, then leaves to join the FBI. A murder occurs shortly afterwards wherein Josie is a witness and her testimony is destroyed because of the outcome of the trial when she was 15. <br />Two years later Josette, who works as a junior investigator for Simon Hart, the Texas State Attorney General, and Marc , who has returned to the Texas Rangers,are thrown together to investigate the death of Dale Jennings, the person who was convicted in the death of Henry Garner, the same trial in which Josette was a witness.  As the story goes back and forth, it is implied that Marc left to join the FBI after the rape trial, then the story indicates that he left after the infortunate incident 2 years before and you are never sure when he did join the FBI. This occurs several times in the story.<br />More murders occur, a Texas crime boss, is involved as well as Bibb Webb and others. The search is on for a missing ledger which would show who was responsible for the Garner death and provide evidence on the crime boss, Marsh.  The ending is predictable.<br />Another descripancy is the fact that early on in the story, it is noted that Josette has brought only a black and navy suit with her.Then during the story, at the same location, she wears, beige, and peach.  Huh?  Where did she get those clothes.  I don't think anyone proof read this book, hence the discrepancies.	2001-08-05

Legends Lake is a magnificent thoroughbred and can be a winner if his fears can be alleviated.<br />This story is about a love of horses, family and the things we all hold dear. The chemistry between Alex and Kate is wonderful as well as the connections between Alex, Kate, Zoe, Jamie and Brigid.  Of course, her evil husband, Cadel, comes into the picture with dire results.<br />If you like Jo Ann Ross's writings, you will love this one.	2001-07-30

First off, it was never explained how Juliette happened to be floating in the river where Chantz found her.  After leaving the stable where Chantz won a boxing match with Boris Wilcox, Chantz was accosted, severely beaten and his winnings stolen and nothing further ever came of that.  Then Tylor, Juliette's supposed fiancee finds Juliette with Chantz and severely injures Chantz by hitting him in the temple with a rifle butt. This injury in combination with the severe beating leave Chantz in bad shape; however, he manages to go to work the next morning.  <br />Chantz Boudreau is Max Hollinsworth's bastard son and Tylor's half brother. Chantz's desire has always been for Max to acknowledge him and thus he keeps for working for Max at Holly Plantation. Juliette Broussard is the daughter of Maureen Jarod Broussard and James Broussard.  Whoever marries Juliette will inherit Belle Jarod, the plantation Juliette inherited from her parents.  Juliette's mother, Maureen, was a harlot, and Belle Jarod was burned when James found Max rutting with her.  Juliette has spent some 15 years in a convent in France.  Max is determined to obtain Belle Jarod and it's 15,000 productive sugarcane acreage.<br />Chantz and Juliette are immediately attracted to each other.  Max hates his son Tylor becaus said son is lazy, worthless and not very nice; however, considering the way Max treats Tylor it isn't any wonder.<br />Next we have a bull gator hunt wherein Tylor pushes Chantz into the bayou after Chantz saves his miserable hide and Chantz is caught by the bull gator.  He is saved by Louis, a slave and his friend.  Although this 15 foot long gator bites Chantz's leg, he does not loose the leg and he does not die.  Shortly afterward, Tylor finds Chantz with Juliette and beats him almost to death; however, Chantz survives this too in a relative short period of time.  Add to this floods, yellow fever, etc. and you have a most unbelieveable story which really doesn't flow.  Many French words are used with no English translation so that leaves the reader in the dark.<br />Let's get back to books like Notorious Ms. Sutcliffe.  This one is a loser.	2001-07-03

Arthur decided to go to Scotland and settle this matter.<br />Arthur is totally unfamiliar with Scotland and gets lost.  He happens upon Kerry McKinnon in the middle of nowhere and she shoots him in the arm causing no great injury.  Unbeknownest to Arthur, Kerry is the widow of Fraser McKinnon, the man Arthur has instructed his solictor to evict in a month if the taxes and money owed are not paid.  Kerry and Arthur travel to the Glenfadden, Kerry's home, and then realizes who she is.  He stays there for two weeks, falls in love with her but knows they can never wed as he is low born. Additionally, Kerry's neighbor, Baron Moncrieffe, tells her her husband owes him five thousand pounds and has offered her hand in marriage to Moncrieffe's son after his death.  Moncrieffe's son, Charles, is retarded.<br />After Arthur leaves Glenfadden, Kerry urges all the people in the glen to leave along with her husband's cousin, Thomas, who is to sell the remaining beeves.  Charles goes to visit with Kerry, attempts to rape her, so she shoots him.  Arthur returns at the same time and takes Kerry away to London.  He has her meet his friends Adrian, Lilliana, Julian, Claudia and his Aunt Paddy. He is determined to have the ton accept her; however, Kerry feels out of place and knows she does not belong in London.  She sells the diamond necklace Arthur gave her and goes back to Glenfadden where she finds that Thomas has been accused of killing Charles.

Quite a departure from Linda Howard's former genre but she is a master at this type of writing just as she is a master of the more serious stories.<br />Jaine Bright and three of her friends make a list they require in a perfect mate.  Somehow this list is released to the news media and much publicity is derived from this.  In the interim Jaine meets her next door neighbor, Sam, who she believes is a drunk, junkie, whatever, although she later learns he is a police detective.  The sparks fly.  The scene wherein Jaine views a naked Sam through her kitchen window is one of the funniest, sexiest scenes I have read.  I laughed till the tears rolled.<br />Meanwhile, a very disgruntled sick person, takes the characteristics in the list personally and decides to systematically kill the four women.  The plot runs from very serious and scary to funny.  The ending will not surprise you. I suspected the murderer early in the book but it made the reading no less interesting.<br />Keep up the good work Linda Howard.  My favorites of her books are Sarah's Child and Shades of Twilight.  I have to add this one to the list.	2001-06-30

Apparently much of the point of this book was missed.  It had love, humor, a hunt for treasure, and a wonderful cast of characters.  I found the interchanges  and conniving between the characters, especially Spears, Badger, Maggie and Sampson very funny.  Yes, Marcus was hot tempered and did &quot;verbally&quot; abuse Duchess but she finally gave him his just desserts.  This is the kind of writing that novels are all about.

I caught myself laughing out loud during this reading.<br />Rurick, a Viking, was cursed 5 years before by Mairie the Witch (supposedly).  She inadvertently placed a blue zig-zag mark down the center of his face.  For the last 3 years Rurick has been searching for Mairie so she can be forced to remove this mark as his bethroted, Theta, will not wed him until it is removed.  What Rurick does not know is that Mairie is not a very good witch.  She keeps mixing up her witch's chants with strange, funny results.<br />The story centers on Rurick's efforts to find Mairie, accompanied but his not so knightly knights who are incredibly funny.  When Rurick finds Mairie he finds she has been locked in a cage suspended over a pit of snakes and will be left there until she marries him.  In his pursuit, Rurick has been joined by Mairie's clansmen who are old and many missing body parts but they are not to be deterred.  They view Rurick as a Scotish Viking and Rurick's scald Bolthar writes incredibly funny prose about Rurick's exploits.<br />Rurick had a one night stand with Mairie 5 years previously which resulted in a son, Wee Jamie.  As Rurick would not take Mairie with him she was left to marry another who discovering she was not a virgin mistreated her.  Rurick does not know about the existence of his son.<br />I am not fond of Viking stories but this was hilarious and I am looking forward to reading Ms. Hill's other books.	2001-03-12

There is no spark between Lydia,  para-archeologist and Emmett London, businessman, formerly ghost hunter.   They're just blah.<br />The plot, if you can call it that, does not hold your  interest.  In fact, the further you read the more you'll decide &quot;Who  cares&quot;.  This is not one of Jayne Castle's best efforts.	2000-09-10
