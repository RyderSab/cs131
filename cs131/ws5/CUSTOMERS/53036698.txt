Perhaps most impressive it the ease with which Parker weaves JKB's life, economic theories and beliefs, the development of Keynesian economics and virtually all post-WWI US history.  While there is little doubt this work is about JKB and his influence on economic theory and policy, his extraordinary busy life, and political connections made initially at Harvard as an instuctor (and, later, as a tenured professor) Parker does a superb job integrating a prodigous amount of US history and policy in a very well annoted fashion and with a marvelous economy of prose.<br /><br />Galbraith, always a controversial scholar, never could be accused of hiding any political agenda.  A true believer in the New Deal and a Great Society, he obviously believed in a coordinated, but not limitless, goverenment role in a capitalistic society.  Those who have studied economics to any degree have the Latin phase drilled in their heads, ceterus paribus - other things equal.  Galbraith thought this analysis and seemingly erudite and complex other mathematical formulas pure rubbish.  As an undergrad in the late 70's I distinctly remember a terrific professor of mine \\"catching\\" me reading An Affluent Society.  He teased me about my \\"leftist leanings\\".  But Galbraith always challenged my assumptions, and, obviously millions of others.  Parker perhaps should be accused of a positive bias toward his subject.  That said, he makes his arguments quite cogent and exceeding well annoted.<br /><br />While I think this book is a must read for those interested in 20th century economic thought, policy or history I would certainly encourage ALL to read the antepenultimate chapter, Joy Fades.  It is the finest 24 pages I have ever read on \\"conservative\\" vs. \\"liberal\\" economic beliefs and policy.<br /><br />Richard Parker's John Kenneth Galbraith is a real winner.  It should be read and on the book shelves of all US historians and economists.  It is one terrific read on a truly remarkable intellectual.orians and economists.  It is one terrific read on a truly remarkable intellectual.	2005-08-21

Granted, writing a book dealing with just one year can be difficult from a context point of view, a reader of McCullough's previous works would expect much more.  His ability to bring Truman and Adams alive in his previous books simply doesn't show it this writing.  He does a reasonably good job in assessing where the \\"Continental Army\\" really stood at the sieze in Boston but misses many opportunities to put that pivotal year into perspective.  While it was an enjoyable read, I think marginally serious readers of history could skip this one and miss very little.	2005-06-21

I read this book cover to cover when learning to fly.  I also read many others but found this to be the most complete and certainly the most readable.  Moving on though my flight ratings I found myself using it often as a resource as we tend to forget such things as how many hectopescals are standard and that can be embarrasing when doing an ATP oral and not being able to explain the end of a METAR.  I have had my students use it thought the years and the feedback is uniformly highly favorable.  I would encourage all to read it and to make sure your instructor knows you are so you can read a chapter ahead before each flight (i.e. VOR Naviagation) before you go intercepting VOR radials.  Machado is very good and a legend in flight instruction.  This book should be THE book for all student pilots.	2005-06-07

It would be a grave oversimplification to state that this is a novel about \\"business\\".  Rather, he is among the very first American writers that dealt with realism.  Frank North was certainly another.  Between them they mark an inflection point in writing.  They wrote about the world as they saw it, somewhat akin to journalism.  They didn't mind, but rather relished, getting \\"dirty\\" in the world of commerce.  Men toiled in this world - why not write about it and the troubles and ethical delimas created therein?<br /><br />This work is about a man's drive, his inability to satisfy himself, relationship destruction, identity loss and society.  It demonstrates in very real terms how high one can climb and then fall.  It is a book that deals with ethics and ponders about whether needs can ever be truly met by the most driven.<br /><br />This book clearly belongs up there with the great ones.  It shows a writing style and a mind of a genius.  It also began to set the pace for some great writing in the 20th Century.	2005-06-06

Ms. Sittenfeld is the beneficiary of much praise from the likes of Dave Eggers, Tom Perrotta, Jennifer Egan and Wally Lamb, along with the New York Times.  Much buzz but a light delivery is what the reader receives.  There are moments of greatness in this novel of co-ed Lee Fiora at prep school in New England.  But it lacks much depth and character development.  It seems that all in the literary community are in a rush to find the new Salinger.  What happened to Donna Tartt?  By all accounts there is a rush to positive judgement about any reasonable young writer that they are the \\"new WHOever\\" before they truly establish themselves.  This book is a reasonable beach read, certainly above the typical generally read bestsellers.  It, in my mind, demonstrates a writer who is better than average but not deserving of all the praise she has received to date.	2005-02-17

If you had to read only one book this year by a new author, this would be it.  One would be hard pressed to find a better and more meaningful first contempory American work.  This book, we all know, begins in Afganistan.  But it spans all humankind.  It is one of hope, dispair, abject fear, love, honor and the human spirit's never ending optomism.  It soars with emotion and the reader finds hope and fear with each turning page.  It is a beautiful work that projects and elicits a huge sum of emotions that will leave readers in wonder.  The accolades that Khaled Hosseini has received for this novel are an understatement of what he has achieved.  The Kite Runner has achieved excellence.	2005-01-28

Included are David McCullough with John Adams, Ron Chernow with Alexander Hamilton, and Joseph Ellis with two - Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.  Many critics have agreed that these are some of the best biographies of a facinating group of American individuals in an very unique time in modern history.  Bejmamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson received acclaim as one that belongs with this group.  Simply put, it does not.  While it is a decent biography about a simply facinating man, it does not integrate Franklins's personality and indivdual history well into what was going on in the Colonies during this period.  The writing is choppy and not well edited.  I would submit that only if you wanted to read about Franklin specifically would this be a good book to read.  If you are looking for an integrated narrative, look elsewhere.  This, quite unfortunately, falls short.	2005-01-15

Simply put, Tom Wolfe (and his New Journalism) is truly an American treasure.  He has written extensively throughout his long and celebrated career, but sadly only has three Big Novels: Bonfire of the Vanities, A Man in Full, and now, I Am Charlotte Simmons.  Wolfe is a writer critics love to hate.  Is it his unbridled arrogance or his ability to literally create an Event when he publishes a novel?  Whatever your take on this figure on our literary landscape, Tom Wolfe has moxie and verve.<br /><br />This book is a terrific read.  It, as with the other two, pulls the reader into his bright, subwoofer-loud, and highly descriptive prose.  It puts the reader where the story line is.  You hear the music.  You see the people.  You are on stage with his vivid characters.  Tom Wolfe is best read when heavily caffinated.  He comes at the reader with unapologetic power.<br /><br />Live on Dr Wolfe for another 20 years and give us at least one more of your wonderful works.  Young authors, read, study, learn, and give us a taste of this wonderful type of daring and bold writing.  Some may not like his style of writing but none will argue has HAS a style.  Literature only matures with writers who dare, such as Flauber, Norris, Updike and Roth.  We need more Tom Wolfes.	2004-12-30

The introduction my Melton A. McLaurin sets up a well researched and thought out work regarding the life of a female slave, caught killing her owner for raping her over a period of years.  The author does two very important things very well in this book.  He demonstates in very real terms the hopelessness of women in particular during this sordid period or American history AND he places in a timeline perspective just before the outbreak of the Civil War when tensions were high, especially in her \\"home\\" state of Missouri, where the stakes could not have been higher with the question of the expansion of slavery into newly admitted states was being hotly contensted.  While it would be impossible to argue that she would ever get a fair \\"trial\\" McLaurin astutely walks us through a real defense team doing their best in a time period where ANY notion of fairness is null and void and, specifically, why this is the case.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any serious students of the \\"peculiar institution\\".  It is remarkable how the author takes an \\"anonomous\\" life and demonstrates how and individual could be and was treated as property and degraded to the depths of our ability to comprehend while weaving in the fast moving antibellum period and the legislation, politics and emotions of the time.	2004-11-12

Much can be learned through his research and direct prose regarding George Washington, the founding of our Republic and the War that had to be fought to procure our Independence.  However, after his award winning biography on Thomas Jefferson, American Sphinx, this seems a bit short on detail.  Perhaps Ellis spoiled us all and the expectations are too high.  Equally likely, is that the real information is in short supply on Washington with very few documents surviving and open to interpretation of historians.  Very much to his credit, Ellis does not stretch credibility and opines only openly and where appropriate.  This is a book that should be read by all interested in this fascinating period of our country's history.	2004-11-09

He proves many literary pundids incorrect in the assumption that one cannot have plot and character develoment.  Mr. Russo draws the reader into each of his very well thought out characters and the town of Empire Falls, Maine.  One thing the author does remarkable well is to make the reader empathize with his characters as each has been well conceived and constructed.  His central plot moves along with good pace and the sub-plots are both interesting and, at time, very amusing.  The novel's denoument is surprising yet quite believable and ties together an already well woven structure.  This is the type of novel that comes along all too infrequently but, once read, will stay with the reader forever.  Empire Falls is simply a great book.	2002-07-01

Professor Ellis delivers a wonderful and insightful look into the life and mind of one of our most influential, and least understood, revolutionary \\"band of brothers\\". His research is clearly first rate, but it is in his analysis that he sheds much needed light on Thomas Jefferson. Ellis details Jefferson's mindset vs. the Federalist camp of Hamilton and Adams, his vissitudes regarding the political and social issue of slavery (while dismissing with equal aplomb both sides claims of \\"conclusive proof\\" of the Sally Hemming love child). Ellis also brings the reader a great understanding of Jefferson the politician, ie his \\"unwillingness to leave his beloved Monticello\\" for political calling. He describes in great detail the \\"rift\\" between Jefferson and Adams and their letters for the ages later in their lives. He doesn't fall into the pitfall of many apologists who argue these letters showed these men later in life changing their views, rather he shows them healing a long strained relationship while maintaining vastly different political philosphies about a burgeoning nation they both passionately loved.<br />This is really a great book and a wonderful and enjoyable read.

His insights into a family with adult children with more than its share of troubles is without parallel. This relatively young author shows the ability to write a Great Book.  This one is not quite there.  He falls short as he unsuccessfully seeks to weave individual lives into the Lambert family but, that said, these digressions, are not without merit.  At times funny and, other times, quite sad, each of these would be plenty of material upon which to predicate an entire novel.  Perhaps Mr. Franzen has pulled a &quot;Pat Conroy&quot; and bitten off more than even he can chew.

Its realism shocks the reader into a state of empathy that one wouldn't understand when first meeting Bigger Thomas.  While the novel was written in 1940, like all great works on the troubling topic of race in America, it is timeless.  Any serious reader of 20th century American fiction who has not read this should do so.  I waited far too long thinking, quite erroneously, that to read Wright would somehow dilute the wisdom that I found in James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison.  This book will never leave me.	2001-10-24

His biographical works and his earlier works on WWII stand alone. His most two recent books, \\"Nothing Like It In the World\\" about the building of the transcontinental railroad and \\"The Wild Blue\\" both exhibit haste in their writing styles (where on earth are the editors?) and a general lack of research one had grown to expect from Ambrose. Even after my complete distain for \\"Nothing Like It In the World\\", I was still looking forward to \\"The Wild Blue\\"; predisposed toward liking it as not only an avid reader of history but a pilot as well. This book can be described as jingoistic as he is rarely critical of anything the Allies did in the air during WWII. The author seeks to put us in the plane on these daring, even somewhat suicidal missions; a noble goal. This he does well. What he fails is by getting choppy and by making George McGovern, certainly a very competent pilot in a very difficult circumstance of both flying and leading, a demigod. This book is about young men put into a newly found form of mass destruction, ie aerial warfare. A dangerous occupation indeed. While Ambrose aptly describes the dangers of each mission, he falls far short of speaking of the context of which Army Air Corp stategically fit into the Allies war aims. In the very last chapter he begins to attack this issue, but it was far too little and far too late.<br />He chose to study the B-24 over the B-17 as the former has received little attention relative to its impact during the war. He does miss describing to the reader the reason for two different major bombers and simply appears defensive in saying the B-24 was a difficult plane to handle and every bit as effective in terms of payload and speed as the more famous B-17. Essentially, Prof. Ambrose leveraged off of his name once more. I should have learned from the last one but did not. While \\"The Wild Blue\\" is a bit better I am greatly doubtful as to whether any other author could have found a publisher for this writing.rose leveraged off of his name once more.

Whether you are a strict stick and rudder pilot or a more procedural and technical pilot the author clearly spells out the basic premises of instument flight, from the cockpit to ATC.  It should be required reading for all students seeking their instrument rating; it was for me.  Please take note: this is NOT a complete guide to IFR flight.  Rather it is helpful in understanding and reviewing the basics.  This should be one of many books read when getting one's instrument rating or CFII.	2000-11-10

This penultimate book focuses on the earliest part of the 20th Century with Vidal taking the reader into arenas that stict historians can only conjecture upon.  The author once again seemlessly weaves his historical family, begun with an illigetimate child of Aaron Burr, through a time when an isolationistic nation somewhat unwillingly takes on the demensions of a true empire.  Vidal has a gift at grabbing a reader and placing them into a time period and facinating them with both his historical and well researched knowledge along with a perverse imagination.  He seems to delight in his unbridled arrogance but does so in a difficult to describe charming way.  With this series now complete, new readers have the ability to read this chronologically which can only add to the enjoyable experience Vidal gives us as he weaves his various webs of fact, historical guesses, and downright enjoyable fiction.  One can only learn from this master of the genre.  Read all but at the very least read Burr and Lincoln.  Both masterpieces.	2000-11-08

Professor Ambrose comes up very short here.  His topic, the building of the first modern transportation and communication link between the settled eastern states and the unsettled western territories could be as compelling as was Lewis and Clark's journey into the unknown so well brought out in his justly acclaimed &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;.<br />In the opening sentence in his acknowledgements he candidly states that when his editor suggested he write a book about the transcontinental railroad he hesitated.  Thoughout this book one gets that sence of hesitency.  He never really seams to bring together the various aspects of this remarkable undertaking; instead they seem fairly disparate and his writing quite rushed.  The technique he has used in the past, namely quoting from those in trenches and unknown to all readers of history to bring alive a time and a feeling, fails him greatly here.  At times the book brings out a wonderderful feeling of awe on the part of the reader but, quite unfortunately, the monotony of his narrative calls into question his desire to write this book and his editor's ability to control the flowery prose riddled with cliche on the part of a major writer of american history.<br />I have been a huge fan of Ambrose in the past and will undoubtedly read his future works.  I have often wondered how he can be so prolific at the same time deliver such a well thought out and researched product time and again.  Happily this book is the exception to his consistancy.<br />The next time he hesitates about writing on a particular topic, I hope he goes with his visceral feel rather than feeling the need to put out some work that is neither up to his standard nor the standards his readers have come to expect from him.	2000-10-11

I was hoping for a great deal more in the political, social and economic areas than Profesor Middlekauff was able to deliver.  If this well  researched historical text were to be part of the Oxford MILITARY History  of the United States one would be less surprised at the laborious details  the author gets into on the various battlefields.  I have previously read  two voumes of the Oxford History of the United States: James McPhearson's  \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and David Kennedy's \\"Freedom from  Fear\\" dealing with the Civil War and World War II, respectively.  Both  of these authors deliverd strongly where Middlekauff fell far short, namely  away from strictly military matters.  I would strongly urge those  interested in military history to read this book.  Those less interested  should search out some other work with a broader analytical framework such as The Radicalism of the American Revolution where its author, Gordon Wood, addresses the political theory and thought that went into the Revolution.<br /><br />Oxford History of the United States  -  Update (March 2007)<br /><br />After a long silence there has been some news this terrific series, as reported in the Boston Globe (December 24, 2006).<br /><br />It appears as if readers are in for a treat over the next 12- 24 months with the \\"missing\\" volumes at least having manuscripts into David Kennedy (Freedom from Fear) and the series' new editor with the passing of C.

US	53036698	R2GCQ0I8SXIC87	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	1	21	25	N	Y	Quite simply, Mr. Grisham's worst.	I have enjoyed a few of Grisham's novels to pass time on long flights or the beach.  Most have been enjoyable for the genre; that is, don't take it too seriously.  Obviously Grisham is an author looking to sell books,  rather than write a strong story.  I think he does have it in him, I would  certainly welcome the attempt.<br /><br />The Brethren is by far his worst.  I am  embarrased to have read it and finished it.  The only benefit I can see in  my \\"accomplishment\\" is that I can save others from such a folly.  Read anything, just not this.	2000-02-16

If you are a fan or Richard North Patterson, as am I, save yourself the money and more importantly the time.  He attempts, and fails, at writing a darker tail of deceipt.  His fictional town of Steeltown is contrived and  not at all believable.  His plot is disjointed and his characters belong in  Greek tragety. Go back to San Francisco Mr. Patterson and leave the dark  Rust Belt for more accomplished writers like John Updike.  Stick to your  knitting.  We would all be much happier.	1999-10-02
