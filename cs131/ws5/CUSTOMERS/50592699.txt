The premise of the book is intriguing and by reading the book jacket you would think you are in for a book the likes of &quot;Disclosure&quot; or &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.  One of the major issues with this book is that it is difficult to sympathize with the main character, Charles, at all.  The story of his betrayal and his actions as he falls from grace in his life flow so quickly in to one another that you don't feel that he's a character you pull for one way or another.  Just as critical within the book are that Charles's actions seem extremely unlikely.  James Siegel explains them away as being noble intentions, but rather they come off as absurd.  The story takes a lame turn late in the book as a way to get Charles out of a jam.  It's like Siegel couldn't come up with any rational story line so he grasped for the ridiculous.  I kept reading because of other reviews that I saw on Amazon, but I tend to think that those people must have been looking for mindless fodder.  To put this book in the same realm as a Dennis Lehane or Harlan Coben book is a joke.	2004-01-26

Another reason for purchasing this was the overall high rating for this book by everyone.  That was incredibly misleading.  If you read thru the other reviews of this book closely, you will find that most people are telling you about the brilliance of the story &quot;The Lottery&quot; and not the other stories in this compilation.  <br />I expected stories on par with the Lottery in this collection.  I didn't find it.  The majority of other stories do not fall in to the classification of horror stories like the Lottery or &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; which Shirley Jackson is also so famous for.  The stories would fall in to the region of American Literature, not horror or mystery.  As some other reviewers have noted there are multiple stories that don't come to a conclusion as one would expect with either a horror or mystery story but are a poignant tale of literature.<br />I am a huge mystery buff and definitely part of the pull of this collection was that it was in the mystery section of my bookstore.  That along with the other items I previously mentioned convinced me to buy it.  If you find yourself buying this for mystery or horror stories, take a pass.  If you are looking to reread &quot;The Lottery&quot; I would recommend taking this book out from the library.  This purchase is only wise for literature enthusiasts.	2004-01-10
US	50592699	R2OTZJ416Z3YH3	0671211803	764649909	Bank Shot	Books	2	4	12	N	N	Gets old quick	Dortmunder stories are amusing, but this one would best be served by being a short story rather than the short novel tht it is.  The premise of stealing a bank, temporarily located in a mobile home trailer while construction of a new facility is going on is certainly entertaining and humorous, the book even in its compact form drags on.  If you love the antics of Dortmunder and his cohorts, you will probably like this as it follows the same formula as others.  However, if you are looking for a humorous story that is more than absurdity then pass on this one.	2003-04-01

Admittedly historical mysteries are not my preference, however I can appreciate a good book no matter what the context.  I have read a couple of Brother Cadfael books and this is not in the same league at all.  I almost always finish a book, especially with a book that I bought.  With this one however, I put it down permanently about halfway in.<br />The primary problem of this book, is that it is extremely tedious to read due to the author's writing style.  She continually switches from one scene to the next.  That's a common practice in books, however she never really catches in a scene before she switches to the next one.  Nor do all the scenes really apply to the overall story (I didn't finish the book, but discussed it with others in a book group, and they confirmed this thought).  Rather than creating a page turner, wondering whats happening in a parallel storyline, you find yourself disinterested.  <br />The other issue I have with this book, is both the number of characters that are extraneous, and the multiple names that the author uses for an individual character.  She'll refer to a character by their first name, then their last name, and later by their title.  With the skipping from scene to scene this process makes it hard to follow who a given character is.<br />This may seem overcritical, but I think the flow of the story plays a large part in whether you like a book or not.  The story itself isn't awful, but I couldn't hold on due to the tedious nature of the book.  <br />This being the first book of her series, Caroline Roe may have worked these issues out with her later novels, but I would definitely pass on this one.	2002-07-22
US	50592699	R21E40WUF4BGPO	0446604658	612130498	Lucky You	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Fair to average	This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards.  I have read &quot;Double Whammy&quot;, &quot;Tourist Season&quot;, &amp; &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, and this book stands below them.  While Hiaasen excels in satire, and in both outlandish characters and stories, this book stretches that limit, and creates both characters and a story that are so absurd that it drags on and on.  In his other books the central character at least has a semblance of normality to them that makes them easy to relate to, and keeps you interested in the story and how events unfold.  In Lucky You, all of the characters lives are the extreme, and while events are amusing it goes overboard to the point that you lose interest.  I have found myself putting this book down several times.  The only thing that has me picking it back up, is that I have been a fan of Hiaasen's other books.  So unless you're a diehard fan of Hiaasen's, I would suggest you skip this one, and move on to another book.	2002-07-17

(87th Precinct Mysteries)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A Great introduction to McBain	This was my first 87th precinct novel, and it definitely has me looking forward to more.  This actually reads more like an episode of NYPD Blue, than a mystery novel, but it is a solid introduction to a group of characters I was not familiar with.  The book is short and flies quickly.  It is a 24 hour segment, covering both the night and day shift and 3-4 crimes that the detectives deal with and solve during their shift.  If this seems like a cliche at all, realize that this was written before Hill Street Blues, or Homicide, or NYPD Blue so this format is years ahead of that television trend and is before Joseph Wambaugh's similar style.  I highly recommend this book.  It'll go quick and will have you in search of more McBain books.	2002-07-17

I will agree with the fact that the story is well written and laid out very well by Vine (Rendell).  As a work of literature this is definitely a good book.  I however, selected this book because it won an Edgar Award for best mystery and had those expectations.  The book moves very slowly.  I put it down countless times and read other books in the process.  I picked it back up because of the wonderful reviews I had seen on Amazon.   (I had not read anything by Ruth Rendell or Barbara Vine to compare the style of this book to her other books.  According to a note in the back of the book when Rendell writes as Vine, she writes in an entirely different style.)  In the end, I wasn't satisfied as a lover of mysteries with the pace or the outcome of the book.  <br />So if you are looking for a fast paced mystery novel then this is not for you.  If your expectation is that of a piece of literature that well depicts a society family in 1940s England, and the dysfunctional nature that they try to conceal and how it affects their lives both then and into the present, then this will not disappoint.  Just don't expect this book to go quickly.	2002-06-20

A book categorized as a mystery, that actually is.  &quot;Old Bones&quot;, was an enjoyable read that read quickly, only taking a few days of moderate reading.  Sure the gathering of a family with strained relationships, decades after some troubling event and all sharing some family secret, is a common theme in mysteries, but it works here, just as it has in so many other novels.  What makes this book most intriguing is the setting of Mont St. Michel and you'll find yourself caught up in the mystique.  While the mystery isn't that complicated, nor the solution that shocking, there are definite elements of the story that can't help but make you appreciate the book.  This book sold me enough on reading another Aaron Elkins book down the road.	2002-06-20

Regardless of whether you agree with the choices of all the stories selected within this book, it is a great representation of american mystery stories in the 20th century.  The inclusion of some of the centuries most prolific mystery writers, (Chandler, Hammett, Cain, MacDonald (Ross &amp; John D.)), famous novelists (Faulkner, Steinbeck, Buck), modern writers (Stephen King, Dennis Lehane, Sue Grafton, etc.), and countless others make this a fantastic collection.  Only a &quot;sour grapes&quot; type of personality could not appreciate this book.  I guarantee that this collection will have you wanting to read more from some of these authors, and probably expose you to authors you weren't aware of previously.  With stories varying from 10 to 40 pages, you can choose how long you want to read.  I am an avid mystery reader, and I while there are many great books and stories I have read, I feel this is the best purchase I have made for the assortment of authors, styles, and stories I have been exposed to.	2002-06-20

I saw that it had won an award for best first novel and set my expectations on it.  The book was extremely slow throughout, and dragged on more and more as the book went on.  I honestly felt myself not caring how the book ended and put it down many times.  The only reason I finished it was that my wife had bought it as a gift for me.  Yes, the plot revolves around the morbid concept of young children being killed, but it isn't that in of itself that I consider the downfall of this book.  The author has chosen to tell this story from both the hero and antagonist's side, but not to good effect.  The suspense doesn't build as to how the two will meet.  Rather it drags on as Wil Hardesty draws conclusions from the flimsiest items that he draws hunches on, so that you find yourself feeling the story isn't very credible.  Furthermore, the interactions of characters, don't seem that realistic, as Hardesty easily puts his friends in peril throughout the book while clearly aware of the nature of the villains.  Overall I feel that the concept of the book had great potential, but the characters and the story itself make the book undesirable.  Don't give any credence to the fact that this won an award.  I highly recommend that you move on to something else, rather than choose this book.	2001-12-17

I started this book and finished in the same day. I can't remember the last time I read a book in one day, and believe me I read a lot. The reason this only gets 4 stars is that comparing it to &quot;Darkness Take My Hand&quot; it would be hard not to fall a little short. That book was so good it gave me chills. Now on to this book, once again Kenzie and Gennaro are drawn into an intriguing case, where nothing is what it seems. There are plenty of twists and turns that jump out at you. The dialogue and action don't miss a step. While I state this isn't as great at the previous book in the series, it is still very good and well worth the read. While it is true that you don't need to read the other books prior to &quot;Sacred&quot;, there are however references to the events in those books that give away their endings, so I encourage you to read in order. Lehane has quickly become one of my favorite authors. He is right on par with Harlan Coben, but with a darker edge. If you haven't read Lehane or are yet to read this book, you are missing out. Pick it up now, so you aren't the last one in on this great author.	2001-12-04

The only problem with the other reviews I have is that none of them, really take into account the first time Wolfe reader.  I found the dialogue and interaction between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin very intriguing.  It shares some similarities of the genius detective and his trusty sidekick.  The difference being here that Archie is more the eyes and ears and the man about town that Wolfe is not.  If you read Christie or Conan Doyle, then you may tire of the dolt of a sidekick who can never figure out in the slightest what the hero detective is up to.  While Wolfe is the genius here, the story revolves around the fact that Archie is present to the supposed suicide of a young single mother that he feels is actually a murder.  It is Wolfe's trust in Archie that commits him to the case at hand.  Throughout the way the police and other parties try to convince Wolfe to give it up, but his intelligence and the resourcefulness of Archie and company find the truth.  Truly an entertaining story and intriguing characters.  It is clear from Stout fanatics that it is worth the read, and take it from a first time reader as well.	2001-11-14

Wow, was that ever right.  This book is so good it gives you chills.  Sure that's an overused cliche, but it couldn't be more true.  Ever once in a while you see a great movie like &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, or &quot;Memento&quot; and it draws you in and keeps you thinking about it way after.  This book has that same characteristic.  When I tried to put the book down, I found myself thinking about it so much that I had to pick it right back up and ignore the chores I should be doing.  Lehane has an incredible knack for drawing you in and creating great characters.  An integral part of the story are the gruesome serial killings that surround the neighborhood that Kenzie and Gennaro grew up in, but there is much more than that.  The characters, the dialogue, and unpredictable twists keep you asking for more.  Prior to this book I had tired of serial killer stories and the formula storytelling surrounding them.  Don't be deterred by that here.  This book is not the same old, same old.  I can't recommend this book more.	2001-08-17

This book also plays well on the lives of Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee and how Leaphorn is affected by the deterioration of his wife's mental capabilities after a lifetime of a loving marriage, and how Chee is affected by the separation from his longterm girlfriend.  In Hillerman's most recent books these items have gotten somewhat out of hand, but in this book everything has its place.  This is a very quick read, and an interesting mystery that may not keep you guessing til the very end, but will have you trying to piece it all together up to the last few pages.  If you are looking for a solid Tony Hillerman book and don't want to start from the beginning, this is a great one to pick up.	2001-08-02

This being the first Nevada Barr book I have read, I can only provide prospective of an avid mystery fan.<br />Nevada Barr clearly does a good job of putting you in the setting.  You can visualize the Natchez Trace Park and the surrounding area.  It is apparent that she spent the time working there and she translates her experience well.<br />That being said, the amount of detail about the area becomes exhaustive.  I found myself skimming thru pages (not paragraphs) that went into the description of the area.  This made the book move slow.<br />As far as the mystery itself, it almost plays an incidental part in the novel.  The solution itself is pretty weak and only plays a key part in the last 30 pages or so.  The book revolves mainly around the life and surroundings of park ranger, Anna Pigeon.  This approach to the book made it very easy to put down, and I would hardly call it a page turner.  The sign of a good mystery is a book that keeps you guessing and has you eager to get the next page to find out what will happen next or what clue will surface.  This lacked that.<br />If you want a book that puts you in the middle of Mississippi, with a mystery on the side then this is for you. However, if you are looking for a solid mystery book then I would suggest you move on.	2001-06-14

While the books was written a long time ago and rereleased in paperback form its hard to tell if the rerelease had any finishing touches.  If you read Higgins, then you know the formula.  Everytime the main character walks into the room there will be an encounter with some clear villain oppressing the weak or taking advantage of a woman.  Even if you haven't read him before I am sure the story is predictable.  As far as a historical representation this book falls short, but happens to be set in Ireland during the late 1800s.  What's the positive.  It is a quick read and if you don't look at books with a critical eye, and just want something that doesn't involve that much thought, then this book is for you.  If you want to read the best of Higgins then I recommend &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;.  If you are already a fan of Higgins don't expect any different from the reissuing of all his other stories &quot;East of Desolation&quot;, &quot;Sheba&quot;, &amp; &quot;Night Judgment at Sinos&quot;.	2001-05-31

I read several reviews that say that Francis has lost it, and I would say that is far too harsh.  Prior to this book, nearly all of his novels centered more around horse racing than this one does here.  That is not to say that the books are racing books themselves, but it plays a key role in the backdrop of the story.  Furthermore, Francis normally gives a character we can relate to put in extenuating circumstances and we feel more of a connection with the story.  In this book, Francis has strayed significantly from the norm.  &quot;Second Wind&quot; plays more like a espionage novel rather than a mystery.  The book in of itself really isn't that bad, but it definitely falls short of what Francis is capable of and doesn't capture his strength as a writer.  So what can you take from this.  If you have already read the book and hated it, don't give up, Francis is an excellent story teller.   If you loved it, then you should really like what else he has to offer.  For those of you considering this book, I offer the following opinion.  a.  If you are new to Dick Francis read &quot;Whip Hand&quot;, &quot;The Danger&quot;, &quot;In the Frame&quot;, or &quot;Bloodsport&quot;.  You will appreciate him as a writer more. b. If you are a big Francis fan, be prepared -- this story is definitely different and you shouldn't expect the same type of tale you normally get.  By itself the story isn't bad, it's just not what you expect from him.	2001-05-31

Lehane is now a widely popular author and he earned his reputation by writing gripping books. It's hard to believe this is his first one.  Many authors show the potential from the start, but few show the ability to characterize and provide a great story on their first try.  This book delivers.  If you are a fan of Robert Parker, Robert Crais, or Harlan Coben be sure to jump in on a Lehane novel.  If you haven't read any of those authors, don't be intimidated it's time to pick this book up.  I regret waiting as long as I did.	2001-05-14

Underlying in this book is a mystery story, but primarily this is a book about the lives of different cops within a precinct.  There is a lot of wit in the way Wambaugh tells it all, but the reality of the characters themselves and their surroundings is uncanny.  This is not one of those police stories where all the cops are either studs with big guns and can shoot at will, or where every cop is a seedy individual.  You can imagine these cops being at a downtown precinct in any city.  The mystery itself unfolds as seemingly unrelated events that happen to different cops come together.  The way these stories come together into one is amusing and realistic as well.  Don't pass on this book.  I had it for a long time before I read it, and I wish I hadn't taken so long in doing so.	2001-05-03

McCrumb does an excellent job of putting you in the Appalachians and of detailing the various characters in this novel.  Even with the powers which the oldwoman  Nora Bonesteel possesses, this story comes off as believable.  As I said the characters come off as real in both their flaws and attributes.  This story has multiple plots occurring at the same time and does change frequently from one scene to another, but this does not take to story, but rather adds to your interest in each circumstance.  Be aware that this is a novel, and not strictly a mystery.  The mystery does not take center stage but its solution is well worth the trip thru Appalachia.  The most rewarding thing is looking back at the end of the book and seeing things that pointed to the end.  I felt much the way I did after I had seen the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;.  Don't pass on this book.	2001-04-24

I think it's because I was so enthralled by &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; years ago, and some of his other older books and the quick read that you get.  However that being said, Higgins follows the same formula for every book and if you have read at least 3 of his books, then you know what is coming at every stage of the game.  &quot;The President's Daughter&quot; is no different from a dozen other Higgins novels I have read.  What I do appreciate is it's a quick read that's entertaining and doesn't make you think hard.  If you want to give one Higgins book a shot, then read &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;, this was when he was at his best and is a quality novel.  If you are a Higgins fan, then you'll read this book regardless, just don't be surprised that it doesn't stand out from many of his other books.<br />So what's the recommendation overall.  If you are looking for a quick mindless read with adventure, then this is for you.  If you want a book with a lot more substance and a believable adventure tale, then you need to look elsewhere.	2001-04-09

It however was the monthly selection for a mystery book group at the local bookstore.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  While the main character is a former nun which sounds kind of hokey, the story itself is not that way.  What is very good about this book is that the mystery itself is the central focus and is well developed.  While the book does tells us some about the character and her life, it does so always keeping in mind the story being told.  There are many popular authors (i.e. Cornwell, Sandford, etc.) that go off on long tangents about the lives and relationships of their main characters.  That author gets absorbed in their character and the story suffers for it.  You can infer from the fact that the main character is a nun, that of course the book isn't filled with gratuitous sex and graphic violence, and that's right.  If you want that in a book, then look elsewhere, but the mystery doesn't suffer from it.  The others in the mystery book group had read previous Lee Harris mysteries and came to a consensus that they liked this book and her other stories as well.  So if you are thinking about this one, give it a chance.	2001-02-27

You feel that Margolin stands on his own and doesn't become an imitation of other popular authors.  If you are like me you have probably read all too many books that center around serial killings.  You may feel that it's been written way too many times.  Don't let any sentiment like that deter you from reading this book.  Margolin does a very good job of portraying his characters and keeps you entertained throughout.  The rewarding thing about this book is that it has a different twist to the killer concept.  If you are a fan of Grisham or Cornwell you should like this book, so give it a try.	2001-02-14

Having paid the additional money I was determined that I would read this book no matter what it took.  This book first of all was extremely disappointing in that the previous reviews prompted me to buy it.  Here's a slew of reasons why it was one of the worst mysteries I have read. <br />1. The story moved slow (like at a snail's pace).  It takes almost halfway into the book to get to the mystery noted on the back.  There isn't any quality build up to that point.  The book moves a long in a series of tangents that are meaningless and you don't need any more insight into the main character Lenny Schneider.<br />2. The mystery and solution are so unbelievably weak.  It's as simple as that.<br />3. The whole book is extremely boring.  I was hoping for a mystery with some insight into a Jewish detective as stated in the other reviews.  I didn't find it.  <br />To belabor this more would only be cruel, but suffice it to say if you are looking for a good mystery skip this one.  Save your money.  I wish I had.	2001-02-07

Like the James Bond books you have to suspend your belief during the course of the book and not wonder how this guy could survive so many near death experiences from book to book.  As with his other books this goes quick and provides ample entertainment.  If you have read his other books you'll enjoy this one as well.  This however doesn't deserve any more than 3 stars because it really is Cussler just getting started.  The story isn't as good as his other future books.  I think that &quot;Deep Six&quot; and &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; were better.  No less outlandish, but kept you at the edge of your seat all the more.  So don't take this rating as anything bad, but just know it's not his best book and there's more you can expect out of him.	2001-01-23

I give it 3 1/2 because I do think it was enjoyable read, but I can't say it will last with me for a long time.  I feel this is a replica or imitation of Josephine Tey's &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;.  That book was superb in the fact that it was a unique concept of solving a past mystery and due to the context in World History of the mystery itself.  I highly recommend that book.  This is the first Morse book I have read, and while I found the characters of the story interesting I can't say that I found the mystery that riveting.  I just didn't find the solution that compelling.  If you are already a fan of the Inspector Morse novels, I am sure that you will probably enjoy this story &amp; I am clearly in the minority rating it as low as 3 1/2 stars.  If you are looking for a intriguing mystery involving history, you should read &quot;Daughter of Time&quot;.	2001-01-16

I think Harlan Coben is the best mystery writer out there now.  The stories are excellent with enough plot turns to keep you guessing all the time.  &quot;Backspin&quot; is no exception to this.  The story is very well developed and as with all of his books this one always keeps the central plot in mind.  Too many books you find yourself wandering for 30 pages at a time on tangents that have nothing to do with the mystery.  I could hardly put this book down, and when I did I was able to pick it right back up and be right into the thick of it immediately.  Don't hesitate to buy this book.  You'll like the characters, the story itself, and not be disappointed by the ending.	2001-01-15
US	50592699	R2FCW4F1GPR0PK	0553299506	985189509	Private Eyes (Alex Delaware Novels)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Admittedly slow for a while, but builds	I think you have to be a fan of Kellerman to really enjoy this one.  I have read several other Alex Delaware novels and know that the stories are generally pretty solid.  This book does start off slow, and I even admit to putting it down and reading another couple of books, before I picked it back up again.  What made me pick it back up, you may ask.  As I said I had read other Delaware books, and knew that there was more than likely an interesting story behind the slow startup.  I feel it was worth it to pick the book up again and the story slowly but surely developed into an interesting tale and felt rewarded for continuing on.  What makes the book slow is the fact that it does not start with a bang as many mysteries do that keep you captivated for a while.  You can read an overall description above, so there is no need for me to repeat it here, but I can say that the beginning of the book spends time on developing the characters and the background of the story.  Maybe not so riveting at first but it does begin to draw you in, and it makes the story more believable.<br />In brief, I would say that if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan then get this book and don't be disheartened by a slow start.  You'll get what you like out of his books in the end.  If you have not read Kellerman before then you might want to try another one of the Alex Delaware's books that moves at a faster pace, and gets you from the start.  I recommend &quot;Time Bomb&quot; and &quot;Bad Love&quot;  if you haven't read Kellerman before.  They get you from the start and if you like those then you should give &quot;Private Eyes&quot; a try.	2001-01-05
US	50592699	R2NSO6CCRBD2QB	0425174093	761415596	The Hindenburg Murders	Books	3	6	10	N	N	3 Stars - Middle of the road book	I debated whether or not to give this book an extra half star for the research that went it to it, but decided not to.  Sure it's impressive to know that the characters in the story are based on the name of passengers in real life and that some of the tale is based on facts, however I couldn't come away with a ringing endorsement of this book but can say that it is an average book.  I didn't find the story that riveting overall and I thought the depictions of the characters themselves were fairly simplistic.  Now this may due to either the author's style or constraints that Collins placed on himself not to get too involved with creating insight into real life individuals.  What does this mean?  This book is not grueling or horrible by any means, it can be read without agony, but if you are looking for a great book you should take a pass on it unless the Hindenburg itself is what draws you to the book.  Otherwise, I think there are better books that center around some historical basis or what if scenarios. (i.e. Follett's &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; or Higgins &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;.)	2000-12-26
US	50592699	R2L8W751EMPPGT	0375408215	375817200	Personal Injuries	Books	2	0	2	N	N	Subpar listening tale - blame the audiotape or the book	I checked out the abridged audiotape version of this book, and I have to say that I found it anything but riveting.  I renewed it a couple of times to get all the way through.  Why did I prolong the listening, because I held on to the hope that I would find this story as rewarding as Presumed Innocent.  I didn't.<br />It was a series of poor reviews from Amazon that prompted me to listen to the audiotape rather than spend the countless hours reading a novel that would fall short.  In stead I spent countless times ejecting the tape from my car radio and scanning radio stations for anything more intriguing.<br />The story moved along at way too slow of a pace, even on an audiotape.  From reading other reviews I think this a general consensus and people just vary on their opinion of the story and characters.  The tale of a crooked lawyer and the corrupt judges he colludes with is interesting, but honestly I felt like I was listening to a drawn out news report that instead of wondering what would happen next I was anxious to know when the pace would pick up.  Well it did not happen.<br />The story while admittedly realistic doesn't draw you in to the characters.  While Robbie Feaver is delved into you hardly feel like you scratch the surface of the other characters.  This may be due to the narrators standpoint on centering the story around Robbie Feaver but I consider this a weak excuse.  In the story the narrator George was unfamiliar with Robbie prior to this case and there seems to be little interaction between the two parties in the story that would lead to only tremendous insight on Robbie's personality.<br />In short I found the story disappointing, and while admittedly there could be something I missed in this abridged version I sincerely doubt it.  If you have read Turow before I think this could probably be the rule of thumb (If you liked Laws of our Fathers you should give this book a chance, if not I would wait for the next one to come along).  If you have never read Turow then try Presumed Innocent or Burden of Proof before you jump into this one.	2000-12-22

I read the Burglar in the Closet, which disappointed me by having an extremely predictable ending, and I read the Burglar who Traded Ted Williams which was a middle of the road mystery.  What kept me coming back was that I thought the character of Bernie Rhodenbarr was likable and the stories flow and end up being a quick read.<br />I thought that this story was intriguing and the ending is not readily predictable.  This story and its characters are well developed and it keeps you interested throughout.  For mystery lovers the references to Hammett, Chandler, and the Christie comparison of the story prove to be an extra treat.  Even if you are not familiar with those writers it doesn't detract from the story and the book should still prove to be enjoyable.<br />So whether you have or haven't read Lawrence Block before, this one is worth picking up.	2000-12-21

You don't need to be a Christie fan to admire the brilliance of the plot and the flow of the story.  The only possible downside of this book is that it was so good that it if some of the story seems cliched it's because there have been so many who have tried to copy the story.  Don't be fooled.  This original is a keepsake.<br />What makes this book so enjoyable is that while it is a relative short book by today's standards it is more enthralling.  It is not burdened with the gore or the sex of so many mysteries today, but has a solid suspenseful story that will keep you guessing until the end.<br />Read this book whether you're a Christie fan, a mystery lover, an avid reader or even if you pick up a book only once in a great while.  You won't regret it.	2000-12-11
US	50592699	R1KIH9O9M2UK26	0140285989	549576481	Totally Dead: A Streeter Mystery	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Totally Average	I was extremely disappointed by this book.  I wanted to like it so much and I had read one of the reviews of this book by someone who appears to be as much a fan of Harlan Coben's mysteries as I am so I picked it up first chance I got. This book had tremendous potential but I don't feel it delivered.   Here are my two big problems.  1) The main character, Streeter - I don't think he was that well developed in the book.  The previous books may have given some insight into him, but I felt like he was more of a supporting character.  In that I didn't find him interesting enough to warrant me purchasing another book by Stone. <br />2. The description on the back of the book.  If you read the back of the paperback you'll get a different impression of the story than what you'll find inside.  Two of the items it plays on are Streeter, which I mentioned hardly seems to be that well detailed, and Streeter's client's steamy daughter (who is barely in the book).  What it amounts to, is that I feel the book falsely advertised itself.  I think we all take the reviews that are shown on the cover of a book like &quot;A Masterpiece ...&quot; with a grain of salt, but I take what the overall description of the book to be a statement of fact and not a polished spin on the story.  If the book had described itself as is, it probably would have amounted to more in my eyes.<br />What does this all mean?  It means if you don't have high expectations you might enjoy this book.  However, if you are looking for a top notch story or character, you should probably try Robert Parker's Spenser books instead	2000-12-11

With only a few exceptions, he has the ability to write mysteries that are entertaining, create characters you relate to, and to make each book a page turner that builds until the end and actually makes you wish the story would continue.<br />&quot;In the Frame&quot; is definitely one of those stories that builds.  Admittedly the book starts a little slow, but it gets more interesting with each page.  If you are a Francis fan, you will be pleased with this performance.  If you haven't read Francis then you are in for a treat.  As with all of his other books, his main character has a different profession from the other books and you get some insight and learn a little about the trade (in this case the main character is a painter).<br />Pick this one today.	2000-12-11

The only reason I give this four and not five stars is I have come to expect so much of Crais that I have set his books for extremely high standards.  Elvis Cole has developed the more tender side as his love life grows, but this doesn't take away from the intriguing mystery and the characters themselves.  If anything I think these developments make Elvis become more realistic and add to the story. If you have read the previous books don't be worried that this will skip a beat.<br />For any concerned Spenser fans, I'll say that I was a fan of Crais before I picked up a  Spenser novel, and I have to admit I was initially blown away by the thought that Elvis Cole and Joe Pike were a reenactment of Spenser and Hawk.  After reading this book though I think that while Crais may have been inspired by Spenser's stories, that his books do not fall into the category of imitations.  They definitely stand on their own.  In other words if you love Spenser then you'll love these books too, for the characters and stories and you will be begging for the next one to come along.<br />I can only guess that this book is not published due to some issue between Crais and the publisher of this book and Indigo Slam.  I found my copy at a used book store.  It's definitely worth the search.  No matter how you find it, pick it up and bring it home.	2000-11-13

The story was interesting, but I have to say it fell short in several areas.  If you like Woods as an author, then this book is entertaining enough that it will keep you going until his next book comes out.  However, if you have not read Stuart Woods yet give another book a chance.  The reason for this is that while it is a story that moves along, it seems to be riddled with cliches and predictable twists.  You also might find several areas of the story far-fetched beyond the story of an honest politician (yeah, right).   Try reading &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; or &quot;Swimming to Catalina&quot;, and you'll get a better feel for the author Woods can be.	2000-11-06
US	50592699	RAOGGDLI91BCK	039914613X	323998329	Easy Prey	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A 3 1/2 for a different kind of Prey book	This book was definitely different from the other Prey books.  This book was actually a mystery.  In so many of Sandford's other novel half of the story is told from the viewpoint of the killer and there is little question throughout the book of who Davenport is hunting for.  There a couple scenes in the beginning told from the viewpoint of the murderer, however you are left in the dark as to the identity of the killer.  Murder follows murder in this book but it makes a little more sense in the storyline than the concept that Minneapolis is running rampant with serial killers.<br />The story is told in a somewhat disjointed way in that it switches from scene to scene often, which does make the story a little harder to follow but I don't think that really takes away from the book.<br />The issues I do have with the story are the ending and Davenport's character.  The ending is definitely abrupt and it reminds me of Patricia Cornwell's sudden ending to mysteries to come up with a solution within the last 40 pages, as if the author is tied in to a certain thickness for their novel.  Now as far as Davenport, I think that far too much of the book centered around how screwed up he is in the head and what woman should he sleep with.  It got old real quick and I have no sympathy for the man.<br />So what does this all mean.  It means if you are a huge Sandford fan you may be intrigued by the difference in the way the story is presented, but you will recognize it is not one of his best.  I am sure you will choose to read it regardless, and it is not nearly as painstaking a chore as many other reviews have made it out to be.  If you have not read Sandford before, and are choosing this book at random to read, my advice would be to give another book of his a read.  I think that although Davenport is not as likeable a character that &quot;Rules of Prey&quot;, the first book is the best one, and would also recommend &quot;Winter Prey&quot; and &quot;Sudden Prey&quot;.<br />Most people's complaint with this book seems to be the story itself, and how it moved along slow.	2000-11-06

It is a very well developed story with interesting characters.  The story builds very well and the conclusion is satisfying.  I would recommend this book to any avid mystery reader.  I am a big fan of Robert Parker, Robert Crais, and Harlan Coben.  While Leo Waterman doesn't have the sidekick that the hero in those books does, he has much the same demeanor as Spenser, Elvis Cole, and Myron Bolitar. The wit isn't quite as snappy, but still enjoyable.  These are only minor comments and what prevents me from giving the book 5 stars, don't let it prevent you from reading this book.  I have a ton of books, but I am sure that I will pick up another one of Ford's novels sometime in the near future.	2000-10-20

Parker has a definite knack for keeping you entertained.  Admittedly I liked Playmates and Widening Gyre a little better, I would not pass on this book at all.  Having read the other reviews I am anxious to get into more Spenser novels because if this one is middle of the road, then I can't wait for the others.  The story centers around the murder of a journalist investigating a small town in Massachussetts that seems to be the cocaine depot of the northeast.  Parker's storytelling and Spenser's keen wit make it a quick read.	2000-10-15
US	50592699	RNCAP6LU8FX41	0380725258	377380120	Skylar in Yankeeland: A Mystery	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Amusing, but hardly spectacular	If you are looking for a mystery forget it.  The mystery is secondary to the rest of the story and is only really approached in the remaining 30 pages of the book.  I found &quot;Skylar&quot; to be a better book, because the story was more original.  As mentioned by one of the previous reviews that story centers around Jonathan Whitfield a &quot;yankee&quot; being the fish out of water around his cousin Skylar's southern surroundings.  It seems this book was written just for the heck of it to see what it would be like to have Skylar up north.  In &quot;Skylar&quot; we learn that the dumb hick image that Skylar puts on is all a facade and that he is truly a clever person.  This story while showing glimpses of his intelligence disappointingly reverts to this original perception and it feels like you are reading the same story again.  If you are interested in reading a Gregory MacDonald book then read one of the earlier Fletch novels.  They don't actually read like the Chevy Chase movies but they are witty and worth the time (with the occasional weak book in the mix).  If you have already read all the Fletch stories then you can give &quot;Skylar&quot; a try, but don't expect it to be on par with them.  I would recommend the Flynn stories: &quot;The Buck Passes Flynn&quot;,&quot;Flynn&quot;, &amp; &quot;Flynn's In&quot; (about a boston detective/government agent).  You may not be able to order them but you can be sure to find them in a used book store, and they are definitely more worth while than the Skylar books.	2000-10-09

It took me a little while to determine whether I felt Shames was a copy of Hiaasen or not.  I think the answer is that yes the story is very similar to those in &quot;Tourist Season&quot; or &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; but it isn't a bad thing.  It's a formula that works and several others seem to have adapted it as well.  This story has it's wacky parts but it is a shade more normal than some of the other Florida books.  The characters are entertaining and the story keeps you interested and moves along.  I feel that it is a good book that can stand alone of the Florida style.  I am sure I will pick up another Shames novel, and you should too.	2000-10-02

I prefer not to get the condensed versions of the books where you miss the development of the story and characters and get only the basics.  While this book did get a little too sentimental, I have to say that it was for the better.  To get the insight into Spenser and how he feels in lieu of always getting the stony detective that defeats all his enemies and solves the crime was interesting.  I thought the story itself was intriguing.  Okay it wasn't as complicated as plots can be, but I definitely didn't find my interest wandering.  I have read one Spenser book and listened to a couple of others on tape, and I have to say that this book will keep me going.  If you haven't read or listened to a Spenser book before I do not feel that you will be lost out jumping into this one.	2000-09-29

It has an interesting story and being one of the earlier Poirot novels you see the development of Poirot into the shining beacon (and more than a little pompous) he becomes later in christie's books.  I think this is well worth the read, and I would rate it higher if it weren't for the issue I have with Hastings which I describe in the last paragraph.  If you have not yet read a Christie or Poirot book then you are missing one of the finest mystery writers ever.  If you are only going to give one book a chance I would recommend the Murder of Roger Ackroyd &amp; ABC Murders over this book, but if you want a good quick read I suggest this book.  If you are familiar with Christie, jump right in and see if you might not agree with what I think.<br />I think in large part my opinion of this book is somewhat marred by my opinion of the narrator character, Hastings, who appears in many of the Poirot stories.  Since this is the second Poirot novel this behavior is excusable however I have read several of the books later on and I get annoyed by the major tendencies of Hastings to : 1. doubt Poirot's abilities.  2. Fall in love with some beautiful woman in each novel and think that woman is always angelic.  3.  draw the wrong conclusions everytime.  #1 is alright here, because he is chronologically not as familiar with the exploits of Poirot.  #2 This annoyed to no end in this book, and portrays Hastings as the hormonal equivalent of a 15 yr old.  #3 This is to be expected as with the Holmes stories that to accentuate the brilliance of the detective he must have a less deductive sidekick, but it would be nice if the sidekick drew the right conclusion every once in a while (I much prefer Watson to Hastings).  I know that this opinion does not help anyone evaluate the merits of this particular book, but I thought it as good a place to state my opinion as any other.  If you can see through this, which you more than likely can you should rush right through the book.ough this, which you more than likely can you should rush right through the book.	2000-09-26

Otherwise I would have just rented the movie, which I have yet to see.  I have to agree with the occasional reviewer that says they didn't get what all the fuss was about.  The story is admittedly an interesting premise, however I found the story exceedingly drawn out and dry.  Admittedly I didn't like Ripley, because I felt that he was emotionally weak and a constant whiner, not due to his evil deeds.  I didn't find the story full of suspense, which may be in large part because I knew there were future Ripley books written, but I feel this was a book that was easy for me to put down and when I would pick it back up it would take me several pages again to get interested in the happenings of the story.  If you are interested in reading one of the classics, then I guess by reputation this one falls into that category (and I am one of the few that disagrees) however if you are an infrequent reader and are looking for a quick read I would advise you to choose another book.	2000-09-20

Read this and was hooked.<br />Elvis Cole and Joe Pike  are quite a tandem.  Start of a very good series.  This along with  &quot;Stalking the Angel&quot; are the best ones.  The style becomes more  formulaic down the line, and after several books it's hard to believe that  anyone can be involved in this many dramatic shootouts.  They are all well  worth the read.

Yes, it had MacLeans normal twist and turns but I don't think the  story was as strong or as interesting as it has been in many of his other  books.  I feel each time he started a new chapter it lost its flow  entirely, and it took several pages to get reinterested in the story.  I  think most all of his books start off real slow, but once you're in, you  are hooked.  Not so with this one.  He is an entertaining author so that's  why the 3 stars, and because he has written worse.  I still recommend  &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; or &quot;Satan  Bug&quot; among others.	2000-08-24

Read &quot;Man from St.  Petersburg&quot; or the &quot;Key to Rebecca&quot;.  This book was a  departure from Follett's other espionage books in that he went into all the  modern biotechnology.  This book was decent, but a lot of it was definitely  spoiled for me by the fact that I had seen the X-Files episode  &quot;Eve&quot;, which predated this book.  Concept didn't really didn't  seem that ingenious to me then.<br />I have yet to read any of Follett's epics  yet, such as &quot;A Place Called Freedom&quot; or &quot;Dangerous  Fortunes&quot; but I am willing to give them a try.  Hope he tackles those  well.	2000-08-24

I  am writing this review several months after reading this, but I feel it was  so good that it deserves further kudos.  The story is extremely good, there  are many twists and turns, and the characters are witty and likeable no  matter how cold they can be at times.  I would recommend both Robert Crais  and Robert Parker to those of you who like Harlan Coben.  I have read  several Robert Crais books, try &quot;the Monkey's Raincoat&quot; or  &quot;Stalking the Angel&quot; and &quot;Playmates&quot; by Parker.  The  stories twists are not on par with Coben (but few are), but the stories  themselves and characters run alongside Myron and Winn.  For anyone  wondering about &quot;Fade Away&quot; if the other reviews haven't given  you enough of an idea, read it now or you'll be sorry.  It won the Edgar  Award with good reason.	2000-08-18

Kerr is a highly talented writer and he is on par with Michael Crichton in his ability to write about different topics  &amp; characters with such detail.  I had read many different world war II  novels (spy and mystery) and this collection surpasses them all.  The books  are admittedly dark.  I can't tell you what specifically happens as it has  been 3 1/2 years since I read these books, but I can tell you they were  good enough for me to want to write a review years later.  Read them and  Dead Meat by Kerr as well.	2000-08-15

The book was enjoyable to read and the character is likeable, however I thought you could see the ending  coming for way too long.  Lawrence Block is too good an author for the  generally weak story.  I read the Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams and  thought that it was better.  I have read all three of his short story  collections and think those are well worth the purchase, so give him a shot  but if you aren't an avid fan, take a pass on this one.	2000-08-15
US	50592699	RN5ZLNNLWN7OY	0345414489	793241904	Dirty Money	Books	1	6	8	N	N	What a Dud	This book is one of the most disappointing books I have read in that I thought it had such promise.  I read the other reviews prior to getting  this book and thought that it would be a good choice.  It wasn't.  If you  have read previous Harry James Denton books you might enjoy it, but if you  haven't like me you won't find enough of a story to be worth reading the  whole book.  I felt the book started well, but it took forever to get to  the mystery itself.  There were about a hundred pages left in the book,  when it got past the point where the description on the back of the  paperback copy described.  That in of itself tells you that there was so  little for even the publishers to even tell you about the book.  From  reading the other peoples reviews Steven Womack has probably written some  pretty good mysteries.  The unfortunate thing is I won't bother giving  another book of his a try, because I feel I wasted my time.  Don't waste  yours either.	2000-08-15

In retrospect it isn't so hard to believe that someone (even a lawyer) could  have a change of heart, but what Michael turns his back on doesn't seem  realistic to me.  Maybe I am a cynic, but read for yourself.  It isn't  Grisham's best book, I think A Time to Kill, the Firm, and the Partner are  the best ones and it certainly rates better than the Chamber or Runaway  Jury.	2000-08-15

However, I still feel it was a good book.  I  really enjoy the characters.  They remind me a lot of Robert Crais's Elvis  Cole and Joe Pike and that isn't a bad thing.  I would recommend this book  but for someone that is going to read only one Harlan Coben book you should  still go with Fade Away.  That one and Dealbreaker were definitely sure  things.	2000-08-15
US	50592699	RUFWECMQFOBKK	0385182627	125492281	Partisans	Books	1	5	7	N	N	Not Vintage MacLean	This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels.  I understand that he passed away prior to this book being  published and that is was compiled posthumously.  While admittedly not all  of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the  others.  Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the  desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it.  I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using  MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and  no one ever seems to duplicate the originals.  If you are going to give a  couple of MacLean novels a try, go for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;,  &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ice  Station Zebra&quot;.	2000-08-15

I never really watched the tv show and I don't know if it was  indicative of the books.  I am a big fan of both Harlan Coben and Robert  Crais and I feel that their characters and sidekicks are very similar to  Spenser and Hawk.  Obviously Parker's novels precede those two authors, so  I have to say he originated a good trend of the witty private detective and  his cool but dangerous partner.  I am also a big sports fan, so this book  was all the more appealing.  It's a quick read, so pick it up.	2000-08-15
US	50592699	R1FEIRUMLTLKGQ	0061092614	974154386	Finding Moon	Books	1	3	11	N	N	Finding a prune	I have been looking at reviews of different books to find if other readers  are in synch with my views.  This is definitely where I differ.<br />It has  been probably a year since I read this book,and I don't remember all the  specifics, but I can tell you the thing that I do remember is that it  stunk.<br />Hillerman is one of my favorite authors and I have either really  liked or liked his other books, but I found this one nearly unbearable.  It  has nothing to do with the fact that Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee were not in  the book at all.  I can appreciate plenty of authors who don't constantly  use the same characters.<br />My opinion is if you really love the Chee &amp;  Leaphorn mysteries stay far away.	2000-08-10

While admittedly it sometimes gets a little difficult to follow  at times, I found the whole premise so different and intriguing from other  mysteries I have read that it kept me going.  My first thought was it is  surprising that other authors haven't really tried to duplicate this type  of story, but I think anything would come up short.  It's like hollywood  trying to remake classics or follow the same storyline (it never works).   There is only one &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and there is only one  &quot;Daughter of Time&quot;.  I am looking forward to reading another Tey  novel.	2000-08-10
