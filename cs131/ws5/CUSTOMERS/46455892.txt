Here we have a GOLD MINE of trivia, facts and much more. Included are biographies of the pickle faced Jimmy Finlayson, Leo McCarey (who directed many of the later films) re-occuring themes, \\"the wives\\" music like \\"The Cuckoos\\" even comments on props like the bowler hats that Stan and Ollie wore. So sit back, relax and enjoy the world of two of the most talented comedians to grace the silver screen.	2005-04-30

Hollywood has left us with image of sharpshooting, hard drinking backwoodsmen (along with a handful of singing pirates no less) mowing down the British, who are silly enough to march right into a hail of fire. But as the author so clearly points out, New Orleans was anything BUT that. Quoting from eyewitnesses from BOTH sides, Pickles provides background into the causes and dispellls the myth that the War of 1812 was the \\"Second American Revolution\\". If anything, the United States was trying to pick a fight and almost managed to get a sound thrashing in return.(Some would say deservedly so) The author shows how politically corrupt both parties were and that jackson was only a hero for a short time. Even more refreshing is how Pickles brushes aside all the folklore surrounding Jean Lafitte, who is curiously absent from first hand accounts. An added fdeature is a short chapter on how to war-game this battle, complete with special effects and sound. <br />Far from revisionist history, Pickles has given readers a generous dose of truth, whether we like it or not.	2005-03-11

But I'm pleased to say that the author of this excellent book has certainly done his homework. The main attraction here is the documented proof of Dr. Samuel Mudd's involvement with Booth. It was more than just a casual acquaintance and it was NOT a coincidence that Booth sought Mudd's help after the former broke his leg after leaping from the presidential box at Ford's theater.Steers doesn't worship anyone, unlike other Lincoln authors have done in the past, rather he presents the players and the facts, warts and all. If you are SERIOUS about the topic, put this tome at the top of your list.	2005-01-22

Cooking is only a passing interest with me, but connecting history with the culinary arts is sure to grab my attention. The Aubrey/Maturin novels seems to have caught on like wildfire, no small thanks to MASTER AND COMMANDER. The writers have done an excellent job documenting the foods and preparation methods that would have been used in Nelson's navy as well as in the books by Patrick O'Brian. From drinks like \\"Dog's Nose\\" and \\"Boiled Sh**\\" to Aubrey's favorite puddings, this volume is entertaining and mouth watering.	2005-01-22

The topic of what the troops of Santa Anna wore from the 1830's to the 1840's is difficult to research at best, and most of what is presented here is a re-hash of old hash. The author does offer a few illustrations that have seldom seen the light of day, but they tell us very little. (The sentry in Yucatan from 1827 wearing cotton civilian shirt and trousers with black belts for example) Chartrande ignores the special campaign uniforms worn by some of the dragoons for the Texas campaign. Also ignored are the rifle companies of the 1840 period which DID exist. Younghusband's plates are quite good, but his soldados look a little too well fed. You didn't get fat in the army to say the least! Lacking are plates showing the fatigue wear, the overcoat, the packs and accounterments. Maybe another author will tackle the subject, and I'll patiently wait until then.	2004-12-17

The author clearly points out that Roscoe was well on the way to self destruction. He was a frequent buyer of bootleg booze during the era of prohibition. He was in trouble with the IRS and despite his million dollar a year salary, his reckless spending was already out of control. Its even been suggested that cocaine was involved at some of the big parties that Arbuckle had. Then comes Virginia Rappe and Maude Delmont, two Hollywood whores with $ signs in their eyes and larsony in their hearts. They saw the opportunity to make some cash and didn't care who they destroyed to get it. Delmont was hardly a stranger to the criminal world and Rappe was a well known slut with several abortions under her belt (No pun intended) Accusations of rape (with a Coke bottle no less)during a wild party was the begining of one of the biggest trials in California legal history. Equally appalling is how self righteous, sanctimonious and moralistic Hollywood became after the scandal broke. Most of the big name directors had round-the-clock mistresses and readily consorted with gangsters like Capone. Arbuckle would be aquitted of the charges, but the damage had been done. Forced to direct under an assumed name (William B. Goode and Reel Comedies) Roscoe faced a hard climb uphill and died on the verge of a comeback.	2004-09-09

Take the thirteen day seige of the Alamo and stretch it out so that it seems like thirteen HUNDRED days. (I kept rooting for Santa Anna myself) Add a lot of exaggerated and one dimensional characters from both sides, male and female. (Why do all the Texians in these novels sound like \\"red-necks\\" when they talk when so many of them immigrated from New England and Europe?) Sprinkle in a smattering of historical detail of questionable accuracy and throw in lots of smoke, modern slang, bodily functions, blood and gore (and a little sex) and you have it. A book that ended up on the best seller list and no-one knows exactly why. (At least I didn't) Harrigan's book is no exception. It was too long and too slow getting started, and it sounds like there is no end in sight. DO us Texans a favor, FORGET THE ALAMO as a subject for another novel. It's been done to death.	2004-08-18

It's a dictionary of the common street language, slang and everyday lingo you'd heard in Glasgow, etc. Some of it is bawdy, some of it is pretty insulting, but it's all part of the culture. It's akin to HOW TO SPEAK SOUTHERN a little booklet that was published many years ago, poking fun at Southern dialect and manners (or lack thereof) Each chapter is headed with a cartoon in the same vein as Terry Gilliam's work in Monty Python. So if you want to know what an \\"oyster\\" is or the meaning of a \\"sanny\\" browse though the COMPLETE PATTER. Just don't forget to turn \\"oot\\" the lights when your done.	2004-08-12

On a warm, partly cloudy afternoon on Thursday, April 21st in 1836 a smaller, poorly trained, ragtag army attacked a larger, better equipped force. In 18 minutes, a nation was born and over a million acres of land changed ownership. Ranked as one of the decisive battles of the western world,the author has done an excellent job tracing the history of the San Jacinto Campaign of the Texas Revolution. Using maps and first hand accounts (many of which have seldom seen the light of day) Stephen Moore tracks both the Texian and Mexican forces. Included are several useful muster rolls and lists show when and where the various volunteer units were formed. (The writer of this review had two ancestors at San Jacinto.) An added bonus are some outstanding paintings by Texas artist Charles Shaw.If you are studying the Texas Revolution in general or San Jacinto in particular, BUY THIS BOOK.	2004-08-04

As so many other readers have pointed out, there are a number of careless errors in this book. The distinction between the Regency Period and the Victorian era does get muddled. Considering the broad timespan and variety of topics covered, it's still worth reading, but there are other volumes that you should consult to verify or disprove the many statements. (DICKENS OF LONDON and the DICKENS INDEX would be a good start if you can find them) The section on currency and it's meaning was interesting, but in no way should it be a guide in comparison to modern money. THAT would be a book in it'self. The dictionary in the back also comes in handy, especially when searching for occupations. Now, I will admit my knowledge of Jane Austen is somewhat limited, and I hesitate to recommend any sources.	2004-06-23

If it's not JFK, it's space aliens and &quot;black helicopters&quot; and sad to say, Abraham Lincoln is not imune to the lunacy. But for the SERIOUS student, here is a book that dispells all of the dribble concerning the assassination of our 16th president. The author takes on each of these wacked out theories and disects them. BRAVO! The most laughable ones concern the Vatican's involvement as well as the European bankers. When in doubt, blame the Catholic church or the rich was the montra in America during the late 1930's and '40's. I'm neither rich, nor Catholic, so I have no axe to grind. Oh, I'm sure the &quot;believers&quot; will continue this psychophantic devotion to blaming Stanton, Andrew Johnson, et al. But face it, Booth was a basket case and he destroyed any attempt at a peaceful reconstruction after the war. What really amazes me is how this hack actor managed to pull off the murder with such a motley collection of mental idiots and buffoons. Booth's derringer was of larger caliber than their collective I.Q. If you are tired of the nonsence of conspiracy theories and want to deal in solid fact, read this book.	2004-06-11

Animated cartoons have come a LONG way from the 1920's and Jones played a TREMENDOUS part in bringing them up to quality. It's a shame we lost Chuck and it seems like there is really no one to fill in for him. But I doubt that anyone could, his work is that good. And sad to say, the current crop of cartoons being churned out now is FAR BELOW Jone's standards.	2004-04-26

From the early days of Austin's Colony to the the aftermath of the Civil War, the text is lively with a dry sense of humor. But the reader is urged to use this book with caution. Some facts don't match up with other documents that were written at the time, instead of years later. (Noah had been banished from Texas in a round-about way. He had made a rifle and loaned it to another settler, who promptly used it to commit a murder.) Smithwick seemed to posess a fair education, which on the Texas frontier was something of an accomplishment.

With just a few short sentances, De La Pena earned the wrath of many modern day historians. To suggest that the imortal Davy cowered in fear and begged for his life was unthinkable, especially to &quot;baby boomers&quot;. But, for all the nay-sayers out there, if you read this part of the text CAREFULLY, it makes NO SUCH CLAIM. And hero worship is hardly a reason to condemn the work. Taken as a whole, it's obvious that De La Pena was an observant, articulate and some would say a compassionate individual. What many scholars are unaware of, is that De La Pena dictated these pages while he was in prison for his opposition to the Santanista regime. He was deathly ill at the time, and it's very likely that De La Pena put more than a little of his anger towards &quot;El Presidente&quot; into the &quot;diary&quot; Some have suggested that the description of Crockett's death was exaggerated and was recorded as more fodder to use against Santa Anna.

It reads like some of those insane &quot;Kennedy Assassination Conspiracy&quot; books. The only &quot;facts&quot; that are in the book are there purely by accident. I saw the movie several years ago and was appallled. When I was given a copy of the book, I almost threw it in the trash. Conspiracy ? A better description would be &quot;Conned-spiracy&quot;.

Taylor's is among the earliest. If the reader is to embark on a serious study of Fields, this should be the first book you read, but use it with caution. Fields was a great rancatour and if a lie would serve better than the truth, he did it. It's hard to seperate fact from fiction when dealing with Fields. No doubt he detested having his privacy intruded on, and his childhood was probably painful. Fields propped up his erratic life with hard drinking, which eventually killed him. And, so many of his tales sound like boozy comedy skits. Still, Fields life tends to read like a Dickens novel. The influence that Dickens had on the comedian is umistakeable, with film characters like short tempered &quot;Mr. Muckle&quot; the portly &quot;Adelai Brunch Souse&quot; and &quot;Professor Eustice McGargle&quot;	2004-02-19

It's so easy to fall into the trap of repeating the same old lore from previous works. Sad to say, this is how the book starts out. The same tired old folklore about Anahuac and Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn. (The author claims that Bradburn and his brother were jailed in Tennessee for stealing slaves. NO, this is another myth. Bradburn's brother drowned in the Duck River, but there is no record of any prisoners by that name. One inmate was accused of horse theft) But once the author gets into the post revolutionary Navy, the text improves. More often than not, the Army of the Republic gets all the glory, but the Navy saw it's fair share of action. Oddly enough, the Mexican Government wanted to HIRE the Navy to help put down a Centralist Uprising in Yucatan. Old wounds tend to heal rather quickly when you are outnumbered! All in all, this is still a useful book.	2004-01-17
US	46455892	R2L7260LQYZDDO	0684865106	627941369	Lone Star Rising	Books	3	6	17	N	N	Not Bad	If you MUST have EVERY book on the Alamo and the Texas Revolution, then you'll probably buy this one. But what mystifies me is, WHY ANOTHER ALAMO BOOK ? It seems like we've had an explosion of tomes on the historic seige of that crumbling adobe church. And each book repeats the same facts and lore. Unless some forgotten or rediscovered documents surfaces, I can't see writing another volume on the subject. Davis did an outstanding job with THREE ROADS TO THE ALAMO and that one is well worth having. THREE ROADS goes into MUCH MORE detail and covers more ground, thus my high praise for that work. But with LONE STAR RISING, its more like he's just cranking out another one to make some extra pocket change. Been there, done that, now let's move on please.	2004-01-16

So, I was pleseantly surprised when I found this book. Thompson covers just about every motion picture made about the 13 day seige. He even covers films that are not about the Alamo directly. In some cases, the crumbling adobe mission makes only a cameo appearance. There is plenty of enjoyable reading here, with facts, trivia and lore. In addition to the lively text are photos and even cartoons that deal with Alamo films. Even if the Alamo is not your cup of tea, students of film will find plenty to hold their interest. From the first movie made in 1911 to the IMAX production; PRICE OF FREEDOM. <BR>What is really telling is how the image of the Texas Revolution, especially the Mexican perspective has changed over the years. <BR>Compare the MARTYRS OF THE ALAMO done in 1915 to John Wayne's 1960 epic. Hopefully this new production by Disney will be a major improvement.	2004-01-12

The author, born in Scotland, makes pointed, and sometimes caustic remarks about the land, the people, wildlife, politics and other topics. Students of Texas History will spot a number of inaccuracies throughout the text. Names are mispelled and some Spanish words are spelled they way they would sound to an Anglo. The author entertains a low opinion of the Mexican people, but also derides the dullards and loafers among the &quot;Yanquiz&quot;.

It's pretty obvious that he has an axe to grind, which CAN be positive. In this case however, it's positively appalling. Long might be a fair novelist, but he stinks as an historian. There are far too many skewered \\"facts\\" in this work. Long destroyed much of the mythology surrounding the Alamo, (DUEL OF EAGLES) but managed to create a whole new batch in the process. In EMPIRE OF BONES, Long takes aim at the Battle of San Jacinto and unfortunately he misses the mark. Revisionists will LOVE this book, and many \\"proud Texans\\" will hate it.

I often re-read certain books many years later to see if my attitude towards it has changed. In this, Watkins is STILL an EXCELLENT read. For students of the Civil War, COMPANY AYTCH is among the best first hand accounts. (Alongside Billings' HARDTACK AND COFFEE) Watkins was educated, observant and witty. (Some might say he was a bit of a romantic as well) Watkins covers both glory and gory with equal coverage. Especially telling is how the war affected the civilian populations, with the food shortages, etc. Southerners have all too long been thought of as illiterate, depraved hillbillies ala TOBACCO ROAD.

Starting his research in the 1940's, Wiley was able to interview the aging veterans of the War. You can imagine what was going through these warriors minds as they recalled their past. Wiley also spent countless hours combing through letters, diaries, official documents and other papers to get his facts. Billy Yank tells the story of the Union soldiers as few have been able to capture. It covers more than just what the soldier wore, ate, used, etc. From his reasons for fighting, opinions of Lincoln, emancipation (pro AND con) officers, the Southern people, the topics are well covered. Reenactors of the conflict would benefit from this book. This is a gold mine of information for the &quot;first person&quot; impression.

(Much of this book was heavy edited and, some would say, ghost written by one of Crockett's supporters.) Still, it's worth adding to a &quot;Crockett&quot; Library. Parts of the book have an almost &quot;Dickens&quot; like feel, especially the stories about the poverty and hardship suffered by the young David. Sprinkled through-out this book are hunting stories, scrapes with bears and panthers, a little romance, skirmishes with hostiles, frontier wit and humor. An annoying part of the narrative are the corny pseudo backwoods expressions, like &quot;burst my boilers&quot; and &quot;knocked his trotters out from under him&quot;. Evidently the author(s) tired of this excessive hoakum too because it abruptly stops. (Thank You!) Much has been written about the legendary &quot;Davy&quot; but this brings the real man into more perspective. Even if you have little interest in Crockett lore, the NARRATIVE is still worth reading for it's glimpse into early 19th Century America.	2003-10-22

An egomaniac, shallow, zealous, bordering on lunacy, Booth destroyed any hope that the South would have had for a peaceful reconstruction. Somehow, I get the feeling that had John Wilkes stayed with the theater, he would always be in the shadow of his brother Edwin. In a twist of irony, Booth was accosted by a drunk shortly before the assassination. The drunk commented; \\"You'll never be half the actor your father was\\" To which Booth replied, \\"There will be some fine acting tonight....when I leave the stage, I will be the most famous man in History...\\"	2003-10-16

In this book, he relates his early years as part of the stage act, THE THREE KEATONS. It's a miracle that he didn't suffer permanent damage the way his father tossed him about. The insights into life in vaudville and his comments about his father are worth a closer look. From there, Buster tells how he got into films, his friendship with Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle and his rise to fame. I was disappointed that he mentioned his masterpiece; THE GENERAL only in passing. This is a CLASSIC! It might have been a financial failure, but in terms of quality, it reigns supreme. Far better than Chaplin's works. But there is still much to hold the reader's interest, especially the era of the &quot;talkies&quot;. Pairing Buster with Jimmie Durante was a disaster in my opinion, but Keaton holds no malice towards him. Buster's career took a dive during the forties, but he managed to stay afloat as a comedy writer. And, Keaton is honest about his drinking and his failed marriages. Let it be said that Buster is still a hard act to follow.	2003-08-20

Tales of daring deeds, flashing bowie knives and shoot-outs are pretty commonplace, but Anne Coleman was every inch a lady and I doubt many men could best her. A native of England, Coleman arrived on the Texas coast in the twilight of the Mexican Republic. Many might consider her work as \\"insignificant\\" but she was THERE. Her observations of typical mannerisms and the surroundings offer a unique glimpse of early Texas. Her account of life in frontier boarding houses is revealing. Such manners! (or lack thereof) Coleman played a significant part during the Battle of Fort Velasco, by molding rifle balls, cutting patches and securing gunpowder. She barely escaped a Mexican patrol after delivering the supplies. She raced across some fifteen miles on horseback and still managed to lose her attackers. Out of print for many years, Coleman's account is worth finding for your bookshelf.	2003-05-13

By the time he arrived, the garrison was ready to surrender. Returning home, Piedras feared another Anglo insurrection and ordered the civilians to turn in their firearms. This led to a confrontation and a running skirmish on the Angelina River. The &quot;Old Stone Fort&quot; was captured by the rabble and Piedras was forced to surrender several days later.

The Alamo is surrounded with myths, controversy and contradiction, and Alan takes each one head on. More often than not, many books about the seige focus on the Anglo defenders and ignore or even belittle the Mexican troops, but not so here. Having spent many years digging into the Mexican sources, I can appreciate what Huffines went through to get his facts. I'd rate this book among the &quot;must haves&quot;. <BR>  I dis-agree with Gary Zaboly on a number of his sketches. Its unlikely that the Mexican rifle companies used the waist belt and powder horns like the British 95th as he shows. His drawings of the Baker rifle and the accountriments are a bit awkward. One sketch looks like it was done in a hurry and has problems with perspective. Still, he has done some outstanding work.

The European connection and the financial woes of the army are explored and, of course, Santa Anna plays a MAJOR roll during the 19th century. If you are a student of military history, go for it !	2002-07-16

Serious students might want to check this one out from their local library, just to get another perspective, but that's about the only thing positive about this book. Inaccurate and careless research, need I say more ? There are plenty of well done tomes on this subject, but this isn't one of them. A better choice would be Edmondson's book: THE ALAMO STORY, or Hardin's: TEXIAN ILLIAD or better still, Todish's: ALAMO SOURCEBOOK 1836.	2002-06-12

He covers the basic causes, then looks at the organization and equipment of both the Texians and the Mexican forces. Sad to say, the plates are poor quality.<BR>A pot bellied James Bowie is shown wearing a fireman's red bib front shirt. Sorry, these didn't exist in 1836. Sam Houston is shown as a white haired old man. In truth, Houston was in his prime during the Texas War. Crockett is shown wearing some un-identifiable fur cap, possibly a skunk. This is another area of debate. Travis looks more like Laurence Harvey from John Wayne's film. The Mexian soldiers fare little better. At least they are not shown wearing sombreros. Hannon does a poor job depicting weapons and his research is careless. If you can ignore the plates, get this book for Haythornthwaites writing. I'd like to see this book re-issued with new plates by Mike Chappell.	2002-06-11

Chariton is DETERMINED TO PROVE that Crockett fell fighting ala John Wayne/Fess Parker and this takes up a good portion of the book. Wallace, GET OVER IT ! Chariton even has a photo of Wayne taken from the film THE ALAMO and tries to compare Wayne and Crockett ! This gives you an idea of the mentality of the writer and this book ! If he had left out these silly comparisons, this would be a more readable work. Historians of the Mexican side of the Texas War will notice how Chariton seems to ignore or even discredit the Mexican sources. Ahem, Mr. Chariton, do I detect a bit of &quot;anti-Mexican&quot; sentiment here ? Yes, we KNOW you are a &quot;NATIVE TEXAN&quot; Mr. Chariton, you remind us constantly. But if you wanted to make this a BETTER book, you should have spent more time in FACT, not opinion. And just a little reminder, THE MEXICANS WON AT THE ALAMO !	2002-04-26

The author, Philip Katcher has been a reenactor and student of period uniforms for many years and his text is a good, basic primer. Gerry Embleton is one of the better illustrators for this series. The information on the U.S troops, both militia/volunteer and Regulars came primarily from the works of James Walker and Samuel Chamberlain. These two sources were eyewitnesses to the war, and while Chamberlain is cocky, and self centered, his comments on clothing and equipment are accurate.Its significant in that photography was coming into use at this time and provides a &quot;first hand&quot; look at some of the uniforms. Katcher and Embleton relied on the late Joseph Hefter for sources on the Mexican Army. At the time this book was first published, Hefter was THE source on the Mexican troops but new information has come to light and I'd like to see the text updated and have Embleton do more detailed plates, but as is, this book is useful.Very few photographs exist of &quot;soldados&quot; from this period. The serious student should also refer to BRASSEY'S HISTORY OF UNIFORMS volume on the Mexican War.	2002-04-10

Most of his information comes from such obscure sources that it's almost impossible to cross check a reference. This really detracts from the Osprey Books. Chartrande seems to be more interested in cranking out books in quanity rather than quality, which is too bad. The color plates by Younghusband are worthwhile though. The major critique here is that the figures look too neat for soldiers that have been in the field for any length of time. More often than not, soldiers &quot;lost&quot; gear or simply threw it away and the charges be damned. Clothing supplied by crooked contractors wore out or even fell apart, forcing the soldier to use home made or civilian items. The weapons shown don't have any wear and the accountriments look too well cared for. Remember, this was an army on the move ! <BR>The BEST plates are done by Mike Chappell, whose figures LOOK like soldiers. Still, for students of the &quot;Spanish Ulcer&quot; this would be a handy source	2002-03-19

He's still trying to get as much money out of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ?

Twain's work becomes tiresome and the same holds true for Burn's productions. While the basic idea of using period photographs and quoting actual documents is a good one, having actors and comedians give their views adds nothing to the picture. True, Hal Holbrook &quot;potrayed&quot; Twain on stage, but his interview was rambling and incoherant. And why was Dick Gregory interviewed ?<BR>Really, the PBS special could have been better. The book is a &quot;must have for Twain fans&quot;, but otherwise I would ignore it.<BR>I ended up disliking Twain more after reading the book and seeing the series.	2002-01-16

More often than not, the author, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that adds little to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are helpful, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works.	2002-01-03

Covering the U.S. Regulars, Militia, Texas Rangers as well as the Mexican forces, this book is well worth having. True, it focuses on the U.S. troops, but this is because there is quite a bit of information, photographs, and exhisting clothing and equipment. The Mexican troops are a bit harder to research. Most historians have come to rely on Joseph Hefter, who pioneered the effort of documenting Mexico's military history. The color plates by Richard Hook are quite good and give good detail. The photos of reenactors also add to the quality of this book. The only negative comments ? The price is high, but if you want a valuable resource, it comes with a cost.<BR>  A section devoted to the weapons of both armies and their effectiveness would have been handy. If you are a student of this conflict, go for it.	2002-01-03

Those who are new to the subject are in for a treat ! Relying on period documents, artifacts from archaelogical digs and pieces from private collections, Peterson's book does an exceptional job of presenting the evolution of crossbows, daggers, polearms, firearms and their related equipment in chronological order. Most of the items depicted are those used by the common people, soldiers, Indians, pirates and rogues. I only wish there were glossy color photo's and measurements.

Granted he was a bit self centered and, at times, self congradulating, but his accomplishments were many. His wit is often stinging. I was surprised to read about his military activities and yet he was influenced by the Quakers. It's also significant that he talks of his belief in the deity and the fact that he was a presbetyrian.
