US	46017729	R2WQORFMOT6GPN	0812555473	532922613	In Legend Born	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Amazing, draws you in.	The first thing I must say is that the world found in this book is rich with history and details as are the characters. They all have a past which seriously influences the story and of which only details are revealed once and a while leaving you in suspense the entire time. It takes a little while to get used to the names or titles which are often said in Silerian, their language but once you do you do not even think about it but read as if it were in English. the story line is much more complexe than one could inmagine and the land is riddled with corruption, betrayal and alliances which keeps the story moving and interesting at all times. the story is set in Sileria an island in the middle of the sea, dominated by the valdani empire and suffering from it as they have suffered under every foreingn rule. THE valdani keep them in line easily enough since they fight among themselves instead of against them and adding. such divided and unarmed by Valdani law Sileria has littel hope. but all that is changed. Josarian a Shallaheen who has comitted the worst crime in the eyes of the Valdani, killing one of them, must run or suffer death by slow torture. the valdani search for him insistantly, his act having aroused the rest of sileria slightly from their submission and also emboldened them. they hire Tansen, a Shatai, a warrior, who was born a shaleheen and has lived nine years in exile. with his help Josarian involuntarily begins a rebellion and is pushed on by Mirabar, a young guardian. the guardians snet into hiding by Valdani law and mirabar considered a demon by all because of her flame red hair. And aided by Elelar, who has worked all her life to see the Valdani expelled from sileria and Kiloran a waterlord, sworn enemy to the guardians. Not sure whether they can trust each other they must work together towards their common dream. <BR>This book was full of twists and turns and a shock at the end. it was well written and I was turning pages late into teh night. the characters a human and interesting, the heros not perfect, the villains not pure evil. I felt drawn into the book very early on and although it takes a chapter for you to click into what is happeaning the moment you do you feel an entire new world opening around you. The end more than suggested a sequel and i await it eagerly.	2002-03-02

With this book the seventh tower series comes to an end. Since the last book left me with a cliff hanger ending, as did every book in the series before it, I was eager to read this one and I was not disappointed. In this book, Milla talon hand, as she has been named since she caries the talon of Danir, is still leading the icecarls in an attack against the castle so as to stop the veil from being destroyed and unleashing the spirits of Aenir into the world. As she does this Tal, his half of the violet keystone taken from him by the powers of evil, is fighting to achieve the same goal as Milla and her icecarls. Together, just as they began the journey, they must save their world from Sharrakor who dreams of controlling both the worlds. It is only here that Tal and Milla see how much they have changed since they first set out on the task, the task that turned into a quest, the quest that turned into a battle. the part in the bok that I think describes the two children best is &quot;somehow the chosen gad almost become an icecarl, and the icecarl was almostt a chosen, both of them blending the best of their two peoples.&quot; <BR>I am hoping that there will be another book in the series but I  know that there will not be since the end of the book had a note of finality about it that cannot be mistaken. This book was as enjoyable as all the others in the series and, even if it is the end of a series it is not the end of garth Nix's writting and I am looking forwards to reading more from him.	2001-12-01

I don't usually read Sci-fi but we were on holiday and this was the only book in the store that looked like it was worth anything. I found this book to be really good.<br />It's the story of Ravan a fifteen year old hex who has a strong talent for using her special abilites. She is distant and doesn't relate well to humans, but she is completely confident all the same. Her kind has been hunted by the CPS for centuries, their power to control computors with their mind makes them to dangerous to live. Most had been caught and exteminated but they never caught Raven. She had ensured that they do not even know of her existance. In fact only her brothe  reallly knows. Wraith, a kind man who wants to help people. Together they search for Rachel, their young sister who may have been a hex. But they find out something that the government had kept hidden for years. A secret that will warp every hexe's life. With Ali,a frightened clumsy hex from the topmost society of England dragged out of her perfect life into one of total chaos, and Kez, a boy from the slums, they start the fight against the CPS. <br />This is the first book in the trilogy, I have read the other two since they are allready out in England. I strongly hope you will read them as well.<br />       Alexeika	2001-09-27

I don't believe I have EVER  read a searies that has so many unexpected twists and turns as this one. Nothing is as it seems in the dark world and Tal and Milla keep uncovering new mysterious things, the talon of Danir, a sunstone which is more than that, mysterious sunken spears in the lake of ash. The two children, in the first book, had lives and tasks that seemed so simple but they are realizing that there is much more to it than they first saw. Tal is searching out the emperess by Lokar's instructions and he is haunted by the memory of the people he has killed (or thinks he's killed.) But when he finally reaches the emperess more unexpected complications are added to his task and he discovers that one more thing he thought true is not. Milla, now a war chief, plans on attacking the castle with the help of the undrfolk. They will drive the shadows back to Aenir and stop the Veil from being destroyed. With this book the plot reaches it's climax, I can hardly wait for the next book, the violet keystone, to come out.	2001-09-04

After I read the arrows series by Mercedes Lackey I was hooked. This is her best book so far. It starts before Talia's story in Arrows of the queen and ends after. It is also linked to the vows and honor trilogy since Kero is Kethry's grandaughter. Kerowyn herself is a strong stubborn and incredible character. She is a misfit in her family and so she leaves. Even if this book is four hundred and ninty two pages long it seems to go by too fast, and when you reach the end you want more. I hope Mrs Lackey does not stop writing about Valdemar.	2001-08-03

This book seems to fill the gap between 'the sword'and 'the chalice'(both of which are super.) I would give it only four stars except for all the unexpected twists in the plot. Gavril's change of heart towards the church, Dain's decision and most of all the end. it was slightly anoying to watch Dain fall in love with Pheresa since she is a character I do not admire that much. It was a bit strange to watch Dain turn into the person he is at the end, although not that strange unless it is not through his point of view that we see the happenings. When it is, we still see the same old Dain, (though slightly more self confident) but through Pheresa's eyes (and in the next book Alexeika's) he is very different indeed. This book is thouroughly enjoyable, although it lacks  bit of suspense, and I recomend you read it, if not for it's contents then to know what happens in between the two other books in the trilogy.	2001-06-23

The characters are well developped and realistic. The scenes are well described and the descripions do not carry on for pages on end. You can easily picture the scene taking place, something I have rarely found in books. You can imagine the Gantese city and the dwarf village. You can see Alexeika in the river and Dain in the hall of the believers. The characters seem real and you feel annoyed at them when, like Gavril, they are pompous and self centered. You feel embarassed for them when they do something stupid. You feel frustrated when they do and sorry for them when they die or when their companions die. It's not like reading a book it's like beeing part of it.	2001-06-23

There is not much on Alexeika and Pheresa but there is just enough to get you interested in them and eager to hear more in the following books. As far as you know in this book, Alexeika is a rebel leader, her father was a prince until his exile. She has a drop of Eldin blood from her mother. Pheresa is a cousin to the prince and she is also his would be wife. She is unseattled by court life since she was raised by nuns. The main focus of the story is Dain (acctually his real name is Faldain). He was left with Jorb the dwarf at two years old, he is three quarters Eldin and has no clue that he is rightful heir to the throne of Nether(although at the end...). Because the story is focused on him it is also focused on Gavril, crown prince of Mandria, who is a selfish, nasty, obnoxious, cruel, spoiled brat, bent on destroying Dain because of his blood and religion. The only person who dares defy him is lord Odfrey, chevard of Thirst hold.<br />This is the type of book that you just continue reading without noticing the chapters fly by and before you know it you are at the end. I can't wait to read the next one.	2001-06-10

Even though this book is somehow detached from 'Sabriel' it is still great. Sure it has the same caracters and new ones too but usually in a sequel the same antagonist is still being battled. But heck who needs another normal series! This was a fabulous book! The mystery that the disreputable dog and Mogget are harboring is still unrevealed at the end. Although I suspect it might have something to do with the begginning of the charter, I will say no more.<br />The main focus of the story is Lirael,(obviously, otherwise the book probably wouldn't be called 'Lirael')a sightless Clayr but who is also a very powerful charter mage and, as we discover at the end of the book, something more. Sam is the prince of the old kingdom and since his sister, Ellimere is destined to follow in her father's footsteps and be ruler, he is destined to folloow in his mother's and become the Abhorsen. Only one problem he is terrified of death, as well he should be, after anencounter with Hedge, a necromancer, there.<br />A must read for anyone who liked Sabriel or other books by Garth Nix.	2001-06-03

Once Milla is heald they set off with a map carved by someone who came from the castle years ago. They use the map and nearly get themselves killed by going over a hudge abyss and climbing through the pipes in the castle. All their troubles result in them getting caught.

A place that has driven many people before her into insanity. Tal is sent to prison and he discovers ther something about his father's disaperence (which is what got him into all the trouble in the first place.)The book ends on a cliff hanger again and leaves you wanting more.

All seems well at first but behind the grins and merriment of the people there is fear of this prince who revels in death and pain. They arive at court and Talia senses danger with her gift of empathy, and that danger is not only to that kingdom but also their own.<br />The best part in the book is definitely the battle. I was grinning in exitement when Valdemar pulled out a 'secret weapon' that is quite a strange one. It is spoken of in previous books but instantly forgotten when it seems of no importance.<br />almost all the loose end are tied up. I say almost because there are few remaining. One of them at least is a very large loose end but ther is one that is less obvious ( I wonder if anyone else noticed). I just hope they will all come together in the next Valdemar books( I also hope there will be new mysteries, after all who wants Mercedes Lackey to ever stop writing?)	2001-06-01

It had adventure, humor, romance and everything else a good book should have. It shows death as it has never been shown before, not as heaven or hell but as a river that flows through nine gates. Sabriel is the perfect heroine, she changes all through the book starting as a high school senior who is searching for her father and gradualy becoming the Abhorsen who is defending both the old kingdom and the rest of the world from the dead. The other characters are mysterious, you are never quite sure what Mogget is and you don't find out about Touchstone until later on in the story. I hope you will read this book and enjoy it as much as I did because words to describe how good it is are failing me right now!( make sure you read Lirael daughter of the clayr as well)	2001-05-20

I guess that's a result of reading \\"the hobbit\\" at a very young age ( I was seven or eight I think). This book changed all that and I now think dragons are really great. The plot is fab and I understand how Kara felt when she got angry and called the birds (I don't take taunting that well either.) I didn't cry when I read this book like I see others have by reading their reviews, but I did enjoy it alot.

Well think again. These fairies are armed and have attitude. they also include elves, dwaves and anything else you find in books. This is not a fairy tale though the, characters are funny and original: Holly short the first female LEPrecon, the lower elements police reconnaisance (the LEP used to wear a uniform consisting of a green suit, hence our steriotypes.) Foaly is a centaur who wears a tinfoil hat and is a computer genius. He will crack jokes even at the direst moments. Mulch Diggums, a kleptomaniac dwarf, who, like all of his species, has an original way of digging. And of couse there is Artemis Fowl. A twelve year old genius from a long line of criminals. Artemis Fowl's family has hatched almost every crime imaginable, but he has devised something different. His plot is to kidnap a fairy and hold it for ransom. It goes off perfectly until the LEP stops playing by the rules.<br />The plot is fast moving , interesting and always funny. Although Artemis Fowl is a strange protagonist he is a good one. You also have your doubts about him during some of his emotional battles. I recommend this book to anyone who liked Harry Potter and even if you didn't you would probably enjoy this book.	2001-05-13

I thought the plot was extremly original and I liked the way Garth Nix created a world instead of using ours and just putting magic in it, using his own rules. In this world there are three types of people, the chosen of the castle who think they are supirior to all, who put up the veil (or at least they think they did, this is debated later in this book and the next ones) and who are very ignorant of many things despite what they think. The underfolk, who serve the Chosen, and the Icecarls who regard the spirit shadows of the Chosen as demons. Tal of the Chosen falls off the red tower and lands in the snow far from the castle. There he meets Milla of the Far raiders, a clan of icecarls. Milla is intent on trying to kill Tal until she is bound to him on her shield maiden quest. Milla and Tal set out together reluctantly. She proves to be a skilled warrior but will take any chance she can to prove that she is stronger or more knowlegeable about the ways of the ice. As the two thirteen year olds head towards the castle they meeet trouble and the book ends on a cliff hanger.	2001-04-30

Hope Glover was the typical orphan who had incredibly kind parents but is left as a servant in a nasty house hold. Apollo was mean to Hope but he is not mean at heart he was just raised to be that way. His father has drummed into his head that he will be &quot; an important man.&quot; and that he is to keep his head up and his chest out. But from the parts of the story that are told from his point of view you see that he doesn't kwant to end up like that. I especially liked the end but I will not give anything away about that. The story begins with Hope living her usual life, when a young woman and her husband come to visit the Rivers. The young woman is Cassandra Aisling who has been on the Basset and was carried to the lands of legend years ago.( Make sure you read the original voyage of the Basset book by James c. christen first.) cassandra sees that hope will travel on the Basset soon aswell and indeed she is right. Hope gets carried away by a magic carpet/kites and takes Apollo with her without knowing it. After that both children see things that Hope had always dreamed of and that Apollo had never dared to, because of his father's instructions. I suggest you read tis bok if you are looking for something light to read if you are like me but fotr people who are not like me yo can decide whether to read it or not on your own.	2001-04-22

You have to buy this book!It's absolutely FABULOUS!The story is the familiar one of sir Gawain and the green knight with a few unusal twists and turns.In this book sir Lancelot appears for the first time,but to the eyes of the reader he is not the great knight of the familiar Camelot tales,he is a self centered show knight who is intent on charming the ladies and making himself called the greatest knight of all England rather then helping Camelot.My favorite part in the book is at the very end when Gunivere puts him in his place.However Lancelot is not the only new character in this book,on their way to face the green knight terence and sir Gawain pick up a young girl named Eileen with no shortage of attitude.Terrence who is the main character learns alittle more about himself and his faery bloodand earns himself a title.

The plot is interesting but it's the characters I find weak, especially Ashen, she is supposed to be the main character but you hardly know what she thinks or how she feels sbout things. The little you know of her shows to me that she is kind of weak minded and willed. I was impressed with her when she gets away from the giant luper and the bog people, although fleeing may not seem courageouss it's smart and she acted fast. The only character developped enough for me to like was queen Ysa, even if she is the antagonist. She is smart and thinks for herself and you see what she thinks. If the characters had been better I would probably have thouroughly enjoyed this. The plot is good and exciting although a bit slow moving, but that only adds to the suspense, but to much of a slow pace is anoying. You know that everything that is happening will come together somewhere but at the end of the book you are still waiting. Some of it has come together but not everything. Despite the cliff hanger ending I feel no compulsion to read the sequel, another sign of a bad book for me. usually if i enjoy something i am eager and impatient to read the sequel. If Andre Norton had created characters as good as in her witch world books (even the ones in the short stories are good) I would probably give this book five stars.

In the begining of this book Dairine is the sort of caracter you just hate but as the book goes on you like her more,in fact she may be my favorite caracter.I think Kit and Nita are unfair to her by calling her a brat and threatening to turn her into a fire hidren.<br />This book is about Dairine's ordeal during wich she is being chased by te lone power since she was sent to force it to surrender.Dairine is given fourty eight hours to find a wepon she uses her time to create a species. I think my favorite part is when Dairine is arguing with her species about entropy,maybe because I know how she feels,knowing she's right but not being able to explain it.<br />I hope you read this book and enjoy it as much as I did.	2001-02-07

I thought this book was great but not as good as &quot;so you want to be a wizard&quot;.The way undersea things,being a whale and the names were described was pretty cool and so were the caracters but this book did not keep me as enthralled as the last one.<br />In this book Nita is on vacation with her family and her partner Kit.But it soon prooves to not be a very restfull holiday since she gets caught up in the song of the twelve,a reenacment of the time when the lone power came to the sea to bring death to it and Nita is playing the most important part:the silent one,the part of the one who saved the sea and she soon wants to back out for a very good reason(wich I am not going to tell you)but if she does what happened to Atlantis will hapen to New York.	2001-02-07

I think this book is fabulous it has a touch of everything: suspense,humor,adventure,romance....I found that Meliara is smarter than is the previous book yet still quite naive (thouhg not quite as much as her brother)but she is still the caracter I came to admire in&quot;crown duel&quot;. <br />The story begins in Tlanth where Meliara has retreated to after the war.The young countess is reading a letter from the Marquise of Merindar who seems to be inviting Meliara to court.Mel is not sure how to respond to this woman who is,after all,the sister of the king,the man whose downfall was partialy caused by herself.When Mel agrees to come to court for her brother's weding she decides maybe this will be a way to find out if the Marquise is friend or foe.Yet in the capital people hide behind their expressionless court masks and friend and foe look alike.Meliara struggles to fit in,while reciving anonymous letters of support.<br />You must read this book,if you don't you'll regret it,I know I would have.	2001-01-28

I really liked the way the author reverses the roles so that dragons are no longer the bad guys but the good guys and the wizards are the bad guys insteead and the knights are...well the knights are more of a nuisance then anything else.Cimorene,the main character has a mind of her own unlike her sisters who are all blond,have blue eyes and are  exidingly silly(or as Cimorene says &quot;they just act silly,they aren't really&quot;).She hates court life an her lessons where she has to learn how loud it is permitted to scream when being carried off by a giant and how to agree with ambassadors with out actually promising them anything so she takes fencing,cooking,latin and magic classes until her father finds out and stops them.When her parents decide to marry her to a tremendously stupid prince Cimorene decides that this is the last straw and runs away to be a dragons princess but I won't tell you any more you have to read the book. Enjoy!	2001-01-17
