This first volume he sees as providing the theological foundation for understanding psychological issues from a spiritual, biblical perspective.<br /><br />The \\"new eyes\\" are the eyes enlightened by faith in Christ and restored to sight by confidence in the sufficiency of Scripture to explain life and relationships. \\"Seeing with New Eyes\\" offers a theological-intellectual defense of \\"Nouthetic Counseling\\" as a biblical counseling model seeking to understand truth about God and humanity through God's eyes as revealed in Scripture.<br /><br />It is an excellent introduction by perhaps the leading theologian in the Nouthetic Counseling movement. However, the book is also a compilation of many previous articles by the author. Thus at times it reads more as a string of excellent artilces than a tightly woven and thematically consistent book. That aside, Powlison is to be commended for his articulate explanation of the human condition through the lens of Scripture.<br /><br />Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians,\\" \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" and the forthcoming \\"Beyond the Suffering: The Story of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"	2005-09-18

When so many other Christian authors are hyping the latest trend and hoping on the latest bandwagon, Smith calls a halt to the march.<br /><br />He does so not as a na√Øve, head-in-the-sand cultural rejecter, but as a world-aware, Word-wise scholar who is well aware of the multiplicity of competing narratives. Smith expertly presents Christianity as THE meta-narrative that explain all the other mini-narratives. Further, he concisely and precisely sifts through the myriad of competing Christian narratives to restore the great tradition-the grand essentials of core Christian belief.<br /><br />Granted, not everyone, including this reviewer, will name and claim the identical doctrines nor define them identically. However, it is difficult to refute the grand movement in the symphony that Smith composes.<br /><br />Personally, one of the most helpful apologetical (reasoned, logical defense of Christianity in light of apparent contradictions) premises is Smith's pithily worded insight that modern (and post-modern) culture has not been able to \\"distinguish absence-of-evidence from evidence-of-absence.\\" That is, we may not always be able to scientifically prove the active presence of God, however, nor can we prove the absence of God scientifically, and we certain can discern His affectionate, sovereign presence spiritually.<br /><br />Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\"D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\" <br /> <br />	2005-09-15

First, we place all our national energy, money, and resources into emotionally hyped issues that provide little bang for the buck. Second, the chicken little, the sky is falling phenomenon causes us to become cynical about real warnings.

In particular, Blassingame's research emphasizes slave narratives and slave letters.<br /><br />He explains that both of these types of documentation allow the researcher to enter the inner world of the enslaved person through his or her eyes, rather than simply accepting the plantation owners' views about slave life. His discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of historical resources along with his explanation of how to use internal and external evidence to assess the credibility of such sources offers a fine lesson in historiography.<br /><br />In his choice of subject areas, Blassingame cuts a wide swath that overviews every core aspect of enslaved life. He begins with an intriguing examination of acculturation by comparing how enslaved Europeans in African, enslaved Africans in South America, and enslaved Africans in North America acculturated. He also explores the important but often neglected issue of the Africanization of the South--how southern Whites acculturated to African American culture.<br /><br />Having laid this foundation, two moving chapters ensue. Blassingame documents slave family life with all its harrowing, horrible obstacles. Yet he also demonstrates the resilience and love of enslaved African American families. Next Blassingame addresses the many obstacles to rebellion and escape, putting to rest the notion that the lack of runaways in any way suggested acceptance of enslavement.<br /><br />His final three chapters explore roles, realities, and personality types. At times his use of now-outdated sociological and psychological theory clouds the issues for modern readers. However, once sifted through and sorted out, these chapters continue to offer fresh information, if not always fresh insights.<br /><br />Overall no researcher can afford to ignore Blassingame's contribution.

Meredith predicts the fate of future Africa based upon his analysis of free Africa over the past fifty years. His pessimistic prediction, though couched in historical analysis of Africa, seems to minimize the similar history of other continents, continents which overcame the proverbial truth that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. For example, if North America could overcome its horrible legacy of slavery and racism (the ultimate examples of corrupt power), why can't Africa overcome its ethnically motivated genocide?<br /><br />Meredith's sub-subtitle (\\"A History of Fifty Years of Independence) portrays the most compelling aspects of his work. For over 700 pages he painstakingly documents the end of the colonial period through our current era. His tale is a sweeping epic journeying over the vast expanse of every country on this great continent. If you want a primer on modern African history, especially political history, this is THE book.<br /><br />His subtitle (\\"From the Hopes of Freedom to the Heart of Despair\\") is painfully honest. It tells the story of the dashed dreams and tortured hopes of the modern African continent. This is not your father's history of Africa. Nor is it for the squeamish. One can understand why Meredith would end up with such a negative view of Africa's future, given his understanding of her past.<br /><br />However, as mentioned earlier, one must not forget that true freedom on every continent has been a long, arduous, imperfect voyage. Perhaps had Meredith dug further into Africa's glorious past, including its history as a world center for philosophical and theological constructs, he might have seen something of the enduring spirit of Africa.

For non-Blacks unfamiliar with the nature of Black preaching, the first four chapters succinctly outline and explain the \\"four corners of the Black preaching universe\\": poetic recitation, imaginative insight, spiritual pharmacology, and spiritual/social transformation. Each of these are illustrated in the subsequent fourteen sermons which offer wonderful tastes of modern Black sermonizing.<br /><br />This wonderful little book would have been enhanced with brief introductory comments about each sermon. When was it preached? Which of the four elements are highlighted and how? Of course, without these, the reader enjoys the journey of discovery.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

Rawick is the introductory volume in Rawick's groundbreaking 19 volume (plus supplemental volumes) series which transcribes the slave narrative interviews made from 1936 to 1938. All volumes are available online at the Library of Congress.<br /><br />In this introductory volume, Rawick uses the captivating title that harkens back to slave times. From sunup to sundown belonged to the \\"master.\\" That's when work was done. But from sundown to sunup, belonged to the enslaved person.<br /><br />Rawick brilliantly culls from narrative interviews the necessary information to conclude that even from sunup to sundown, the enslaved person's soul and mind never had to be enslaved--only his or her physical body.

And with good reason.<br /><br />Grudem writes with clarity and creativity--two rather rare components in systematic theology texts. He begins each chapter with questions that assist readers to see the relevance of the topic to their lives. He then ends each chapter questions for personal application--showing how truth relates to life.<br /><br />Grudem, though strong in his scriptural support and defense of his views, avoids a critical spirit toward those with whom he disagrees. Thus his writing is theologically founded and relationally inviting.<br /><br />One might wish for more development and discussion of opposing views. Additional exegesis of the core texts that support the views presented also would improve an already fine book.

Raboteau is the foremost writer on the history of African American Christianity. In \\"A Sorrowful Joy\\" he writes his own history as an African American Christian. First delivered as two lectures in the Harold M. Wit Lectures at Harvard University Divinity School, Raboteau communicates his personal spiritual autobiography with power and poetry.<br /><br />A phrase from the foreword by Kimberly Patton brilliantly summarizes Raboteau's life story: \\"None of us is only the sum of our wounds.\\" Raboteau shares forthrightly about several wounding experiences in his life, both those he endured and those he inflicted. Providing hope, he also humbly recounts how God brought healing and forgiveness to these broken relationships.<br /><br />Throughout the narrative of his journey of suffering, seeking, and spirituality, Raboteau beautifully weaves the twin narratives of African American slave religion and Orthodox Christianity. He details his surprised at the slowly evolving realization that they both emphasize the theology of the Cross. That is, African American Christianity and Orthodox Christianity both face the reality that suffering can't be avoided, while also believing the higher reality that suffering can be converted. In this one summation, Raboteau accurately captures the essence of two grand religious traditions. In one brief book, he poignantly captures the essence of an authentic spiritual journey.<br /><br />Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Soul Physicians,\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\"	2005-07-19

Holmes is a rich and rare contribution to the subject. You will search far and wide to find anyone discussing spiritual formation in the history, culture, and present situation of the Black Church. Thus Holmes' contribution, by focus alone, is an important one.<br /><br />Holmes does an excellent job \\"re-imaging\\" contemplation. That is, in \\"Euro-Cultures\\" contemplation is often seen only as individual and silent. However, as Holmes carefully details, African American Christianity has practiced communal, active, verbal contemplation.<br /><br />Holmes is especially insightful when she derives contemplative practices from the historical black church in slavery. From lament, to dancing, to the hush arbor, to the ring shout, to the slave spirituals, and much more, Holmes explains how each of these rituals were contemplative in that they led the community to see with spiritual eyes God's goodness in the midst of humanity's badness and madness.<br /><br />Holmes also does an excellent job explaining how holistic and integrative African American faith was and is. Heavenly hope, for African American believers, is certainly about a future filled with relationship and joy. However, it is also about seeing and experiencing God NOW, even in the midst of the horrors of slavery and racism.<br /><br />For African American Christians wanting to \\"tap into\\" their spiritual legacy, \\"Joy Unspeakable\\" will become a standard. For European American Christians wanting to understand and learn from their brothers and sisters in the faith, \\"Joy Unspeakable\\" is a must read.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

It truly is a page-turner. The authors never give away how their alternate historical account will end--hint at it, yes; give it away, no. They kept me guessing, which kept me interested.<br /><br />The narrative was tightly woven--not an extra word to be found. The pacing was such that I never found myself thinking, \\"Just get on with the story.\\" Instead, I was turning pages as fast as Custer's stead.<br /><br />As in the previous two volumes, the southern characters seem to be given more depth, valor, and honor. Perhaps this was necessary given the premise that the South won at Gettysburg. However, Grant, Custer, and Lincoln could have been further developed. The negative portrayal of Lincoln through southern eyes was at times a tad off-putting. However, the portrayal of Northern Black Regimens and Black Volunteers was powerful.<br /><br />A great book could have been even better with a few more topographical maps. Also, it seems that the writers wore out a bit toward the end. (Both of these matters were likely due to editorial/publishing/space decisions.) The essential battles that turned the tide seemed to be given less descriptive detail than other earlier, less important confrontations. On the other hand, their concluding descriptions of the honorable treatment of the defeated side was quite moving.<br /><br />The series begs for a sequel. Given how this version of the Civil War ended, how might history have changed over the next hundred years from 1864 to 1964 (from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement era)?

With his army still outnumbered and his supply line never able to match the North, Lee and the South still had an uphill battle to fight (pun intended).<br /><br />My only complaint about \\"Grant Comes East\\" is the lack of emphasis on Grant in particular and the North in general.

Rather, it is a battle between the one new person in Christ and the remnants of the old ways (the \\"flesh\\") learned prior to salvation. It's still a battle--but one eminently winnable through Christ who declares us \\"more than conquerors.\\"<br /><br />As the subtitle suggests, \\"Experiencing True Freedom through Your Identity in Christ,\\" Evans uses biblical passages and current illustrations to reveal the new you--the true you in Christ.

S. Lewis' masterfield expos&egrave; of Satan--the False Seducer--and his insidious, diabolical schemes and temptations.<br /><br />Screwtape is a senior demon training his nephew, Wormwood, in the finer arts of infiltrating and influencing, for evil, the human mind, heart, and soul. Letter by letter, point by point, as Lewis pens the imagined correspondence between these two demons, you feel as if Lewis has stepped inside your soul and listened to the secret musings of your mind.<br /><br />How? How did Lewis gain access to the process of spiritual seduction? The same way the great saints of old did--through knowing God, knowing self, and knowing Scripture. This trilogy of epistemological awareness is essential for understanding the schemes of Satan.

With David Wheaton's \\"University of Destruction: Your Game Plan for Spiritual Victory on Campus,\\" there is now an option that is relevant, penetrating, and practical.<br /><br />Author David Wheaton has \\"been there, done that.\\" From his own experience on the campus of Stanford University, from his research, and from his interaction with 1000s of young people, Wheaton has distilled three \\"Pillars of Peril\\" for the Christian on the college campus: sex, alcohol/drugs, and humanism. After identifying the perils, Wheaton creatively offers realistic guidelines for raising the college spiritual GPA in order to become a victorious Christian on campus.<br /><br />Wheaton demonstrates his insight by not stopping at the \\"body sins\\" of college campus--sex, drugs, and alcohol. For the deepest, ongoing college peril is the \\"mental sin\\" or \\"faith sin\\" of the deconstruction of belief that systematically occurs on secular college campuses.<br /><br />You know that a book is solid when both Sean Hannity and Dr. John MacArthur recommend it.

Lewis' Spiritual Formation	In \\"Seeking the Secret Places,\\" historian and C. S. Lewis scholar, Dr. Lyle Dorsett, writes a lively story of the spiritual life of author C. S. Lewis. As Dorsett notes in his Preface, much has been written about Lewis the Christian author, but much less about \\"how he grew from infancy to maturity in the Christian faith\\" (p. 15). Thus, Dorsett's purpose is pinpoint: \\"As a student of his life and writings for well over two decades, I have been intrigued by a question that has inspired this book: How did C. S. Lewis mature spiritually after his conversion to Christianity in 1931?\\" (p. 15).<br /><br />Prayer is the first of Lewis' spiritual habits that Dorsett explores. Appropriately so, since Lewis himself taught other young converts that the first rule of spiritual growth was \\"be busy learning to pray\\" (p. 30). Dorsett's description of Lewis' struggle with believing prayer, brought on it part by the death of Lewis' mother when he was only nine, is worth the price of the book. Lewis summarized his own battle, as only he could: \\"Often when I pray, I wonder if I am not posting letters to a non-existent address\\" (p. 34). Throughout his excellent chapter on prayer, Dorsett demonstrates the stages of growth in Lewis' prayer life and the nature of that life of prayer. In no small part, prayer for Lewis had to be real, not sentimental, because our lives \\"do in truth influence God\\" (p. 39), and because \\"one of the purposes for which God instituted prayer may have been to bear witness that the course of events is not governed like a state but created like a work of art to which every being makes its contribution (in prayer) a conscious contribution, and in which every being is both an end and a means\\" (p. 39).<br /><br />Reading this chapter not only informed me, but enthused me, even as \\"joining into this artistic enterprise enthused C. S. Lewis\\" (p. 39). \\"That we creatures are coworkers with the Creator quite simply excited him\\" (p. 39). As he grew in the school of prayer, Lewis was delighted to learn \\"that God invites us to be partakers in the execution of his will\\" (p. 46). Dorsett's explanation of Lewis' views on the age-old issue of Divine sovereignty, human responsibility, and prayer, provide some of the clearest, most practical theology that you can read on the topic.<br /><br />Real regarding prayer as petition, Lewis was even more raw concerning prayer as praise, noting that initially he felt as if God said, \\"What I most want is to be told that I am good and great\\" (p. 47). \\"He wrote that such an attitude disgusts us when we encounter it in humans\\" (p. 47). A lifetime of struggle to praise led to a depth of insight toward the end of his life. \\"It is not that God insists or demands our praises, it is that when we begin to see Him more clearly--then who He is demands one's praise\\" (p. 48).<br /><br />To his description of Lewis growing in grace through the spiritual discipline of prayer, Dorsett adds equally compelling chapters on Lewis and Scripture, Lewis and the Church, Lewis and Spiritual Friends, Lewis and Spiritual Guidance, and Lewis on Soul Care (what I call \\"sufferology\\"). Dorsett then concludes with an important chapter summarizing Lewis' spiritual formation legacy.<br /><br />If you want to understand C. S. Lewis' practice of the traditional spiritual disciplines of the faith, I know of no better source than \\"Seeking the Secret Place.\\" If you want to be schooled in why and how to practice these disciplines, and if you want to be motivated to do so, then \\"Seeking the Secret Place\\" is the place for you.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

Nature, according to Pascal, points more to the Mediator--Christ--the One who reveals the hidden God as a God of holiness and love, and the One who reveals us as God's prodigal children who need to come home.

As a seminary professor training pastors, professional counselors, and lay encouragers, it's often difficult to find books that are biblically sound, therapeutically insightful, personally authentic, and relationally powerful. Langberg has accomplish all of this and more.<br /><br />She derives her title from the tragic biblical story of the Levite (priest) who allowed his concubine to be raped throughout the night by the men of Gibeah. As Langberg tells it, \\"Sometime during those early morning hours, she died, lying at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold\\" (p. 11).<br /><br />So begins the chilling, yet compelling saga of four voices (\\"a chorus of voices\\" as Langberg puts it): the author's voice, the voice of survivors, the voice of the reader, and the voice of the Redeemer. Langberg blends these four voices into a harmony, a symphony of healing. Together they tell the story of the damage done and the healing offered physically, emotionally, rationally, relationally, and spiritually.<br /><br />For entering into the story, the very soul of the abuse victim, there is no better book.

Dan Allender writes from a foundation of biblical insight, psychological research, and counseling experience.<br /><br />Allender is quick to defend abuse victims and to help them to understand that they were not guilty for their abuse. At the same time, he refuses to leave the victim a victim. Instead, \\"The Wounded Heart\\" provides the spiritual diagnostic categories necessary to help victims move to victors by exploring how they may have responded to the abuse in less-than- healthy and less-than-godly ways. He labels these responses \\"sinful relational styles\\"--learned, self-protective patterns that victims choose in order to handle life self-sufficiently.<br /><br />Because of Allender's emphasis on sinful relational styles, victims looking for empathy and therapists wanting training in empathic responses may be disappointed. Diane Langberg's \\"On the Threshold of Hope\\" and \\"Counseling Victims of Sexual Abuse\\" offer more in this area of \\"sufferology.\\" Still, for biblical insight into the heart issues surrounding sexual abuse, \\"The Wounded Heart\\" provides the healing cure.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

Lewis' insights into the validity of Christianity remain as current as today's internet blogs. \\"Mere Christianity\\" answers the intellectual questions of post-modern intellectuals and provides nourishment for the spiritual hunger of Gen X/Gen Y seekers.<br /><br />Lewis writes in the style of his intellectual mentor, G. K. Chesterton. Both men entered adulthood as agnostics. Both men spent their careers defending the rational integrity of Christianity. Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" addressed the questions typical of the agnosticism of his era (1900). Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" addresses the hardened agnosticism of his WW II generation.<br /><br />Like Chesterton, Lewis not only discusses how Christianity is rationally consistent, but also how it meets the \\"real world/real hunger\\" test. That is, he demonstrates how Christianity is relationally fulfilling, meaningful, and consistent.<br /><br />\\"Mere Christianity\\" also reads something like a Christian version of Plato's \\"Republic.\\" In the \\"Republic,\\" Plato attempted to define the shape of a society that would produce \\"happiness\\"--meaningful, purposeful existence for the individual and the society.

For the first time, Chuck Swindoll focuses his literary skills on the ancient art of Christian living through spiritual discipline.<br /><br />While some assume that the current generation lacks discipline and the will to sacrifice, Swindoll recognizes that the opposite is true. Today's generation could become \\"the greatest generation\\" if they were mentored into the historical practices of the Church.<br /><br />Swindoll provides the mentoring-in-writing through his user-friendly examination of eight classic disciplines: prayer, humility, self-control, sacrifice, submission, solitude, silence, and hope. Though these are familiar to readers of books by Foster and Willard, they are not the standard practices of most evangelical Christians. With Swindoll's reputation, he may well incite a new wave of spiritual formation.<br /><br />As with his other writings, Swindoll provides ample biblical content to ground his topic theologically, then surrounds his chapters with timely illustrations, helpful suggestions, and practical exercises.

Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformer, emphasized the justification that happened the moment of saving faith. Edwards emphasizes the regeneration that happened at that same time.<br /><br />In justification, a Christian receives a new \\"nurture\\"--freedom from the penalty of sin and forgiveness that welcomes the believer into the loving, fatherly arms of God. In regeneration, the Christian receives a new \\"nature\\"--a new heart cleansed by the blood of Christ and empowered to experience growing victory over sin.<br /><br />The message of \\"Revolution Within\\" is vital for every Christian. Too many believers are taught that they are forgiven (which is an eternally wonderful truth), but remain ignorant of the equally marvelous truth that they are also changed internally. Edwards calls this \\"new covenant living\\" (based upon many Old Testament promises and New Testament passages).<br /><br />\\"Revolution Within\\" offers a fresh look at supernatural living.

As Solomon in Proverbs shares his real-life wisdom with his son, so Janet Parshall dialogues with her adult daughter Sarah Parshall Perry about reconciling childhood dreams with reality--living with adventurous integrity when the fairy dust settles.<br /><br />The book of Proverbs brilliantly and practically addresses issues that many parents blush to discuss with their children. Likewise, mother Janet and daughter Sarah discuss five core issues that really matter: beauty, self-worth, relationships, sex, and treasures (money and materialism). What makes the book so powerful is the way these relevant topics are presented--conversationally in story form. The authors beautifully weave together the biblical narrative, the narrative of beloved fairy tales, and the narrative of modern life.<br /><br />Unlike some Christian books on the topic, \\"When the Fairy Dust Settles\\" does not settle for a fairy tale view of life. Listen to their heart-felt summary: \\"As young girls we all believed in fairy tales. We dreamed of happily-ever-afters, sure that our futures were blessed. And had to deal with the real world and what happens when the fairy dust settles.\\"<br /><br />A Pollyanna philosophy of life says, \\"This life's a fairy tale.\\" An Existentialist life philosophy says, \\"This life is all there is, and it is cruel and harsh.\\" A Christian theology of life, as cogently presented by Parshall and Perry, says, \\"This life is not all there is. Face what happens when the fairy dust settles in light of the eternally true tale of a King who sent His Prince to pursue, woe, win, and renew His princess.\\"<br /><br />Each of the five sections contain three chapters with each chapter offering an exchange of love letters interacting about topics that every mother and daughter wish they could discuss. But don't let that \\"love letter\\" stuff fool you. They don't always agree, but they do always disagree respectfully. And they always write with thought-provoking poignancy.<br /><br />If you're a mother of a daughter, buy two copies. Read them together. Then write your own proverbial love letters to each other, sharing honestly about living after the fairy dust settles.<br /><br />If you're a husband and the father of a daughter, buy three copies. The one you read could help you to understand the women in your life better than you could ever imagine.<br /><br />After you buy the book, and read the fifteen chapters, be sure not to miss the conclusion: \\"The Final Fairy Tale.\\" Without understanding the final fairy tale, you really can't understand how Janet and Sarah interpret the reality we call \\"life.\\"<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

Writing fifty years before the supposed advent of post-modernity, Chesterton's defense of Christianity as the one true meta-narrative addresses post-modernism powerfully, relevantly, and effectively.<br /><br />Combine this with the poetry of his prose and his experiential honesty, and you have a book without peer in addressing the crying need of our day.

Like an experienced athletic coach, Whitney offers a spiritual workout routine that each reader can format into a personalized plan for growth in grace.<br /><br />Integrating scriptural wisdom, historic practice, Puritan theology, and relevant illustrations, Whitney weaves together a mosaic of \\"the habits of devotion and experiential Christianity that have been practiced by the people of God since biblical times\\" (p. 15, \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life\\").<br /><br />After anchoring his theory in theology (chapter one), Whitney explains ten classic spiritual disciplines: Bible intake, prayer, worship, evangelism, serving, stewardship, fasting, silence/solitude, journaling, and learning. Wisely, he emphasizes the core purpose of each discipline: godliness, Christlikeness. Knowing human nature well, he concludes his study with exhortations to perseverance in the disciplines.<br /><br />Written a decade-and-a-half ago, \\"Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life\\" remains relevant and required reading for anyone wanting to know how and why to practice the spiritual disciplines.

Reading the spiritual auto-biography of a pre-modern Saint like Augustine reminds us that history is the democarcy of the dead, giving vote and voice to our ancestors (to paraphrase Chesteron in \\"Orthodoxy\\").<br /><br />We are not the first to be reflective. We are not the first to explore our inner world. We are not the first to struggle with guilt. We are not the first to integrate inner spirituality and the philosophy current in our day. Augustine did all of these, and so much more, 1600 years ago.<br /><br />Reading Augustine's \\"Confessions also reminds us of the \\"three ways\\" that Christian theologians and philosophers have historically taught that we can know God. We can know God through His special revelation in Scripture. We can know God through His general revelation in nature (creation). Aquinas emphasized integrating this \\"way to God\\" with special revelation. And we can know God through His natural revelation in human nature (in the image of God in humanity). Augustine emphasized integrating this \\"way to God\\" with special revelation.<br /><br />This is where Augustine's \\"Confessions\\" diverges from post-modern auto-biography. Today's auto-biographies tend to be \\"all about me.\\" Not Augustine's. Augustine searched his soul to know himself not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end.<br /><br />For Augustine, self-reflection enhances our God-reflection. Since God is eternal and since we are created in His image, the deepest longings in our souls point toward the only One who can fulfill our longings.

Pastor John MacArthur and Professor Wayne Mack successfully edited a fine introduction to the history, theory, and practice of nouthetic counseling.<br /><br />The authors focus their thinking around three core concepts: the historical role of lay and pastoral counseling in the local church, the sufficiency of Scripture in the change process, and the methods for implementing such care. The first two sections develop this historical and biblical approach to counseling. These sections are followed by sections on the process and practice of biblical counseling (all of the process sections were written by Professor Mack).<br /><br />Readers of this text will receive a clear introduction to the concepts central to nouthetic counseling. What they will not receive, and no book can provide all one needs for counseling (other than the Scriptures), is information on what might be called \\"parakaletic\\" (from the Greek word \\"parakeleo\\" meaning coming along side with encouragement for one suffering) counseling. In other words, \\"Introduction to Biblical Counseling,\\" while a fine overview of the historical and biblical role of helping believers to overcome sin and to grow in sanctification, is not an introduction to the historical and biblical role of helping believers to deal with the evils that they suffer in a fallen world.<br /><br />Historically and biblically, both lay people and pastors have always dealt with both suffering (the evils we have suffered) and sin (the sins we have committed). \\"Soul care\\" is the historic term used for the process of sustaining and healing those enduring unjust suffering. \\"Spiritual direction\\" is the historic term for the process of reconciling and guiding those struggling with personal sin issues.<br /><br />In the decade since this book was penned, nouthetic counselors have focused more on this area of suffering.

In modernism, we decided based upon logic: the analysis of factual data, as much of it as we could gather. In post-modernism, we decide based upon the synthesis of sensed experience, as small a slice as we can focus upon.<br /><br />Fortunately, Gladwell does not lean exclusively toward an either/or approach. That is, he recognizes the necessity of facts, while emphasizing the way the brain works to process information.<br /><br />What Gladwell writes in pithy narrative, psychologists have discussed for decades in what is known as HIPT: Human Information Processing Theory. Their model overlaps with Gladwell's main focus: to make wise decision we need the ability to think holistically-to envision seemingly disconnected puzzle pieces as a beautiful mosaic.<br /><br />I've applied his thinking to areas as diverse as a fantasy baseball auction draft, to a counseling session. In fantasy baseball, I've always been the most informed participant in our group of 14 grown-men who spend a day in April acting like boys. However, Gladwell helped me to detect my \\"information overload.\\" I had all the facts, ALL the facts, but not enough of the feel. Not enough of the intuitive sense that gathered the data, related it to our group, and adjusted quickly to changing scenarios.<br /><br />As a professional counselor and counselor educator, I've always practiced and taught that we must add relational competence to our theoretical understanding.

His publishers say it well, \\"He shares jaw-dropping examples of judicial power grabs and liberal power plays by judges.\\" Though vitriolic in style, his prolific documentation prevents this from being just another \\"the sky is falling tale.\\"<br /><br />For Levin the diagnosis is clear: will activist judges continue to write law rather than interpret the constitution? Less clear, and perhaps a weakness of \\"Men in Black,\\" is the prognosis (what is likely to happen should this continue?) and the prescription (what could be done instead to rectify the situation?).<br /><br />Levin's work causes one to wonder about the relationship between the court in the last fifty years and philosophical deconstructionism over the same time period. French philosophers Jacque Derrida and Michel Foucault, among others, helped to launch a movement that is anti-foundational by teaching that all language is socially constructed.<br /><br />Therefore, no text, be it the Christian Scriptures or the American Constitution, can be viewed as an authoritative foundation upon which to build a life or a nation. Instead, each new generation much give to these texts their own new meaning, rather than seeking to apply or derive any supposed original meaning or intent from those texts.<br /><br />This is the \\"deeper diagnosis\\" of the current, post-modern legal dilemma. It leads to a \\"deeper prescription\\"--one that will take longer than most conservatives would wish. Foundationalists need to enter the intellectual arena of the elite academic institutions where most members of our three branches of government are educated. Armed with intellectual arguments, they must state their case for their belief in the original authorial intent of traditional documents, and they must make their case that those documents have served the test of time and therefore are worthy of trust.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Bob Kellemen, author of \\"Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\"and therefore are worthy of trust.

Truly \\"a treasure chest containing varied essentials of our country's past\\" (\\"Religious Studies Review\\").<br /><br />Readers can expect to find four essential sections accompanying every reading. First, the editors provide an introductory overview of each time period, placing the readings in historical context. Second, they share a brief, enticing narrative introducing the author and the context for his or her writing. Third, they provide the writing itself, along with bibliographic documentation. Fourth, they conclude each section with an extensive annotated bibliography. For historical researchers like myself, wanting to do primary research, this section alone is \\"worth the price of the book.\\"<br /><br />\\"Documentary History\\" is a rare historical work due to its combination of breadth and depth. As already noted, Gaustad and Noll provide materials on every imaginable \\"religious group\\" within American history. Their selection and presentation demonstrates an unbiased commitment to fairly represent all traditions. To this breadth of coverage they add depth of selection-their readings are not mere paragraphs torn out of context. Rather, they are extended readings with enough material to gain a true picture of American religion-first hand, first person.<br /><br />One might wish for more documents concerning the American Hispanic religious experience (one or two documents discuss American Hispanic Catholicism). The early immigration of Asians to the western United States before the Civil War could also have allowed for documents representing the Asian American religious experience.

Spiritual theology, a common enough term in Church history, needs defining today. Simply stated, it is a theology of the spiritual life--what the Bible teachers about how we love God and love others (Matthew 22:35-40). As Peterson puts it, \\"The single most important thing to understand in spiritual theology is that it is not about theology ... it is a cultivated disposition to live theology.\\"<br /><br />As the sub-title suggests, Peterson writes in his normal conversational, soulful, narrative manner, explaining and exploring the nuances of the Spirit. As always, his writing is \\"earthy\\"--real, raw, captivating, and convicting.<br /><br />In a day when Christian authors tend to write from extremes (either theology or spirituality), it's refreshing to see Peterson unite (reunite) the two. Not only refreshing-it's essential. An accurate understanding of spirituality must combine community (how we relate in Christ), content (what the Bible says about our relationships), character (who we are from the inside out), and competence (how we mature relationally) all in the context of Church history (listening to the voices of our ancestors in the faith).<br /><br />If you're looking for a \\"how to\\" manual, you may find yourself disappointed. That's simply not Peterson's style or intent. However, if you're hoping for a foundation upon which to build your spiritual life, then you can find none better than \\"Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places.\\"<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

As he notes, many people have written theologies, many have written counseling manuals, but until his book, no one in the 20th century had attempted a focused theology of counseling.<br /><br />Dr. Adams discusses the ten classic doctrines of the historic Christian tradition, providing an introduction to evangelical theology. He then relates each doctrine to the field of biblical counseling.<br /><br />As his subtitle suggests (\\"More Than Redemption\\"), the Christian life does not end at redemption, but begins there. Thus, much of \\"A Theology of Christian Counseling\\" appropriately focuses upon sanctification (the doctrine of the Christian's growth in grace). Adams is at his best here as he dissects the process of putting off the old way (mortification or, as he calls it, \\"dehabituation\\") and putting on the new way (vivification or, as he calls it, \\"rehabituation\\").<br /><br />In his introduction, Dr. Adams states that \\"A Theology of Christian Counseling\\" was meant only to be a first salvo. He asks that others come behind him and develop more in-depth theologies related specifically to biblical counseling. In this sense, Dr. Adams stated the one limitation of his own book--though an excellent start, its breadth of coverage leaves it lacking somewhat in depth of theology and in depth of methodological application.

The agnostic intellectuals on the left will likely be intrigued but unlikely convinced.<br /><br />Though written with homespun humor and interesting illustrations, \\"Finding God in the Questions\\" is too pithy for the title. Is this a book about questions and doubts, as the jacket cover and promotional materials indicate, or is it a book about answers? Doubt is not probed seriously enough and answers are not explored thoroughly enough. Several times I allowed my hopes to grow, anticipating a soul-stirring, mind-stretching discussion of honest doubt, only to find quick answers that seemed to value closure over exploration.<br /><br />As an introduction to issues relative to questions of God, Jesus, and personal ethics, \\"Finding God\\" is a valuable addition to the literature. As a deep and personal probe into the psyche that wrestles with the idea of a good and personal God in a seemingly evil and impersonal cosmos, \\"Finding God\\" left me with too many questions too easily answered.<br /><br />Crabb's \\"Finding God\\" examines similar terrain in a way that felt more personal.

It's rare for a secondary source to clarify the meaning of a primary source, but Marsden does just that. For instance, Edwards' \\"Religious Affections,\\" quoted by so many modern evangelicals, is understood by so few. Marsden captures the culture and context that motivated \\"Religious Affections\\" and thus explains its meaning and potential applications today.<br /><br />Though long, Marsden's style is lively; he rarely says more than is necessary. Perhaps the sheer length is why a few typographical errors remain in this first edition. That aside, Marsden has written what will be the classic Edwards text for decades.
