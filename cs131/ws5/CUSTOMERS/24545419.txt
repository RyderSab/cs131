The books time lines fall into place as she reels the reader in and lets them see first hand the emotional effects of abuse. But, if you read closely, you find that there are many powerful messages here. How to become the survivor, how not to judge the man/woman on the street fighting to hold themselves together with drugs and drink. Why someone might take thier lives at a young age, and why some girls turn to prostitution ...all of these ways are there way out and away from the pain they need to face, but can not. Ms. Stewart shows the reader how to rid themselves of the demons that lie in wait. I could not put this book down, i had to keep turning the page...had to know what else went on. This book is a must for Universities,mental health establishments,High Schools and certainly..Parents!! ...and anyone that lives with a Victim or is a Victim.
