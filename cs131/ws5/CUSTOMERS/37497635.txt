His West Country mysteries, always with a generous sprinkle of English history, Celtic mysticism and superstition, never fail to captivate. Prayer is no exception. The Reverend Merrily Watkins is a winningly human sort of priest, with a neo-pagan daughter and a former rock star boyfriend. Supporting characters are equally well-drawn. While Rickman's plot this time round is quite complex, he moves it along at a fast pace, dropping clues to the reader if the reader's sharp enough to catch them. The surprises don't end till the very last page. If you think evil is an abstract concept, read one of Rickman's books.	2005-10-13

Weidiger did an admirable job of describing her longing to live in this most enigmatic of cities, and of the many logistical and personal roadblocks she had to overcome to achieve the dream. Then, a bit less than halfway through this engaging story, the dream becomes a nightmare. The author became fixated upon not just living in Venice, but upon living in one particular apartment in one particular palazzo. No matter what. Other reviewers have covered the many flaws that spoil this book at this point. Just another few words on the ending. Talk about leaving the reader hanging! What was that all about? Hope she's OK now. Hard to believe this book got published in its present form.	2005-10-07

I Love You Like a Tomato is an often bitter, sometimes sweet novel aabout a little girl born of a teenaged mother in war-torn Italy. Others say ChiChi is pazza, crazy, but it's her mother who's the crazy member of this family. There isn't much wrong with ChiChi that her self-absorbed, self-pitying mother couldn't fix if she bothered. This dysfunctional family moves to post-war Minnesota, and Marie Giordano tells the story of ChiChi's desperate quest for love. Engaging and funny despite the sadness of it's theme, Love/Tomato is a little known gem of a book that also illuminates the experience of the Italian immigrant to 1950's America.	2005-10-03

Astra declinant, non necessitant.<br />The stars dispose, they do not compel.<br /><br />A rich blend of history and authentic period detail with a touch of mysticism, The Stars Dispose tells the story of young Tommaso de Befanini, born into a Florentine family famed for its fine cooking. Tommaso, only 11 years of age, finds himself struggling with more than learning to properly carve a roast. The city of Florence is being torn asunder by warring factions, and the Befanini are employed by many of the important movers and shakers. This novel teems with famous characters - Michelangelo, Caterina de Medici, and Pope Clement, to name but a few. Roessner is a skillful writer, particular in her flair for description. Where this book falls short is in its plot, which is surprisingly slow and lumbering, ultimately leaving the reader hanging, a device that suggests plans for a sequel. Still, Stars is well worth reading for its atmosphere and winning characters. And if you like reading about fabulous feasts and recipes, open a bottle of your favorite vino, nibble some melone and prosciutto, and curl up with The Stars Dispose.	2005-10-03

This first novel by Anthony Capella is a fresh and sassy romp of a love story. Very Italian, very gourmet, very funny, very sexy, it's a perfectly delightful summer read, a mini holiday in Italia. Witty, satirical in places, sad in other places, but ultimately satisfying, Capella has captured personalities with style and precision. It reminded me of nothing so much as a Shakespearean comedy, not so much in terms of literary value, but with respect to its bawdiness, its charm and its humor. Delicioso and molto buffo!

Greek Taverna is a welcome exception. Stone manages to convey the essence of Greek island life, geography, and ambience without attempting to convince the reader that life in those parts is idyllic and carefree. Indeed, Tom and his family encounter as many problems and stumbling blocks as they might have in NYC, as well as enjoying the beauty and simplicity (all is relative). Reading his experiences is as refreshing as a dip in the Aegean. Bravo to Tom Stone for his honesty, sense of humor, and willingness to remain in Greece despite the bursting of the bubble of his dream.	2005-08-29

Three generations of historians follow the same mysterious trail through western and eastern Communist Europe, telling of their adventures in their own words along the way.

A passionate young man dismissed in the village as nice enough but useless. If ever two lovers were star-crossed, Vito and Maddalena certainly were. In this well-written first novel, Castellani throws family resistance, Germans, a mentally ill mother, poverty, and a girl who can't know her own mind in the path of Vito's quest for love. Maddalena doesn't deserve this generous, resourceful, devoted man.<br /><br />A Kiss from Maddelena put me in mind of Berniere's Captain Corelli's Mandolin, which I also enjoyed, though Kiss lacks the depth of Corelli.	2005-08-21

Palladian Days is somewhat like one of those without the cute pictures. At first these memoirs of expat life in foreign locales were charming and fun, but by now they've been done to death. In this audio version, the narration is performed by the author, Sally Gable, in a not very professional manner. While this volume contains some interesting detail in places, it's just too long and full of labored metaphors and weak jokes. I think if this had been one of the first of this genre that I'd picked up, I might have found it charming. But how many of these can you read and still find fresh?	2005-08-19

Each of the individual characters in the story are deeply affected by a single event, the accidental drowning of 2 children. While most of the villagers appear to have recovered from the traumatic deaths, under the surface the memories and ghosts of the lost children profoundly influence their choices, their relationships, and their daily lives, forever.<br /><br />Tricia Wastvedt's first novel is a masterful, atmospheric mystery written in a beautifully evocative style reminiscent of Daphne DuMaurier (Rebecca).

I read this classic about ten years ago when the story was new to me, and remember feeling quite confused by the large cast of late medieval characters. When I came across this audio version, I had to give it a listen. Derek Jacobi's rendition is delightful, breathing life into what can read as mere factual prose. His rendition of the young American researcher reminded me of Jimmy Cagney, but this simply added some levity to an engrossing tale. I'm convinced - now if YOU want to know whether Richard III was a deformed monster or a maligned monarch, give this entertaining and informative performance of  Tey's well-respected investigation try. It's stood the test of time.	2005-08-09

Lehane is an outstanding writer whose prose and dialogue are a pleasure to read. Nary a jarring note from start to finish. Shutter Island is not your average detective or noir genre novel.

McCrumb cleverly melds historical figure Daniel Boone with novel character Clayt Stargill, making this close to a time travel mystery with history repeating itself. The timeless tensions inherent in relationships - father/son, brother/brother, husband/wife, friend/friend, nature/man - play a pivotal role in this story that revolves around  basic questions about who owns the land. The resolution of the central mystery involving the apparition in the woods is chilling.<br /><br />McCrumb is a skilled, elegant writer - her prose is a pleasure to read.	2005-08-02

I'm never clear about why an author who is not trained in expressive narration would choose to record his/her own book. In my experience, it's not very successful, and such things are best left to professionals. Lydia Cassatt is no great exception. The author's voice is childish in tone and pitch, and distracts from rather than adds to the story. That said, about halfway through this version, I came to feel that the voice rather fit Lydia's character. She was the unknown sister of an artist whose fame was increasing year by year. She was struggling to come to terms with her illness and her own mortality. That Lydia's family so loved her was undoubtedly a factor in her ability to do so. The factual accuracy of this story is less important than the opportunity to watch and listen to Lydia as she might have faced her fatal problem. Her grace, intelligence, and moral strength as depicted by Chessman are inspiring. This is a lovely work of art that stands on its own.	2005-07-31

My husband and I are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to travel once or twice a year. I always plan for our trips by buying and studying 3 guidebooks, one with lots of pictures, the Blue Guide to the site in question, and if available, the Cadogan guide. Most guide books contain practical information and cover the major tourist attractions almost like a top-ten list. The Cadogan guides, written by individuals who have lived in the region, delve much deeper, providing coverage of smaller,  little known places that are fun to find and explore. I know of no better way to discover and experience local life and color. We are independent travellers, almost always booking flights, cars, and reservations on our own on the web. We also enjoy delving into places off the beaten track. The detail in Cadogan is much more encompassing than that in any other guide we have used. The driving directions are usually right on the money. Its literary, architectural, and historical information is particularly helpful. We have discovered many little known gems because of these guides. If you prefer group tours that stop for short periods at several locations, Loire and other Cadogan books are too detailed. But if you have the time to wander a bit, these are the guides for you.<br /><br />Regarding Loire specifically, we visited the valley in March, when many of the major chateaux were not yet open for the season. Using this guide, we found more than enough wonderful places to explore. Chateaux, troglodytes, restaurants, art, history, Joan of Arc, Eleanor of Aquitaine, scenic vistas....

Hystrionic divas, hysterical directors, a castrato who rested too long on his laurels, down-at-the-heels aristocrats - the book is peppered with colorful characters.

The Wire in the Blood is also well written, with a compelling plot, credible characterization, and a smarmy, creepy narcissist for a villain. I enjoyed the book and read it quickly to reach the dramatic conclusion. There are descriptions of sadistic violence, but for the fairly squeamish reader that I am, they were bearable. The one problem I see, and this is just my opinion, is that the protagonist, Tony Hill, is just a bit too cool and too clever, in some ways just as plasticky smooth as the killer. Not a hero who's easy to warm up to, despite his post-traumatic sexual problems. Fortunately, Carol Jordan's persona is competent but still fallible, easier for the reader to relate with.<br /><br />Wire in the Blood is a good, gripping psychological thriller and while Tony Hill could be more likeable, this doesn't detract from the value of the story.	2005-07-20

I picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching Mystic River, the film based on another LeHane novel. Darkness, Take My Hand did not disappoint. Different characters, same setting, and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil. LeHane's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing, a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre. LeHane's descriptions jump right off the page at you. His characters are so human, so intense, their dialogue so sharp, that it's almost like watching a movie in your mind. There isn't a wasted word in this book. The suspense starts to build on page 1, and never lets up, becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter. This is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you're NOT alone in the night.<br /><br />LeHane's other works top my summer reading list. I'd love to see what he could do in a different genre.	2005-07-11

But the evidence she discovers proves invaluable, so much so that she nearly ends up dead as well. What's a copper to do?<br /><br />This somewhat slow-moving mystery sustains interest with its settings (a 200 year-old mausoleum, for one), and  its colorful cast of supporting characters (the village drinker, not an alcoholic, mind you,  the insane lady of the manor, the man-hunting American secretary), and its Englishness.

The plot - commoner takes on the corrupt and cruel nobility. The characters - returning crusader searching for lost wife, possessing a relic of inestimable value he doesn't know he has; evil, self-serving lord; romantic young noblewoman gives up everything for love; courageous peasants. The setting - medieval Europe. But somehow Patterson failed to inject any life into this story. His prose is ordinary, mainly descriptive, somewhat jarringly written in 20th century American vernacular. Italics scattered upon every page clue the reader in to points that the author feels are important - it might be possible to get through the entire novel just by reading the italics! Hugh, one of the least charismatic main characters ever written, nevertheless manages to enlist the entire region into his rebellion.<br /><br />Despite these flaws - The Jester clearly is not great literature - the story is compelling enough to make the novel worth finishing. Not good history but a decent enough beach or airplane read.	2005-07-04

Perhaps because Next of Kin is one of her early works, it fails to match the standard she has set in such novels as The Choir. A relatively brief tale of loss, grief, attenuated hopes, and the rediscovery of love and forgotten dreams, Next of Kin has potential that it never truly reaches. Bet Ms Trollope could improve this greatly with a rewrite. As it is, she has done a good job of depicting characters who are locked within their own fears and accommodations, who manage to chip their way back out in much the same way as a baby chick in its shell.

The residents of this small town in Maine are depicted as dour and unwelcoming, resentful of outlanders and bound by centuries of inbreeding and tradition. The unwitting city folk who have the audacity to buy a 250-year-old, dilapidated house are almost immediately subjected to anonymous intimidation.

In my work as a museum educator, this delightful tale serves as a valuable intro to the world of pre-industrial textile production, especially in colonial America. The illustrations are humorous, which dePaola is famous for. Charlie needs a new cloak, and he takes the reader through the process of making one, from shearing his whimsical sheep, who help him with his work, to weaving, dyeing, and sewing the new garment. Too bad Charlie doesn't notice, as soon as he puts it on, that his favorite sheep is already chewing on his hem!	2005-06-15

You can even make dye from ragweed, that bane of allergy sufferers! Very helpful reference.	2005-06-15

Though a bit overlong, this novel is unique to my experience in presenting the life of Richard III in positive light, for a change. His story is told in the first person by the character of his wife, Anne Neville, who is a victim of the plots and machinations of Warwick The Kingmaker, her father, and then of various other nefarious relatives, male and female.  This is a colorful story, well told, and a fun, painless way to learn something more about those complicated Wars of the Roses. Recommended for lovers of English history and semi-fictionalized adventure. I'll certainly be trying out more of Plaidy's epics.	2005-06-08

Lovely collection of traditional lace shawls and patterns, updated and improved. Some of them are hard to find, and it's convenient to have a compilation like this. It does take experience to work some of them, but the patterns are clear and certainly span the world of shawls and lace. Can't decide which to try first. Beware though - if you are not a patient knitter who can stick with a project, this is not the book for you. On the other hand,  if you're up for  a challenge that results in a beautiful classic garment, there are many ideas in this volume.	2005-06-02

I agree with other reviewers who found the use of modern idioms (\\"movers and shakers\\" and \\"partying\\", for example) rather distracting. As for the F-word, I think it goes way back in time and has been used quite freely by all kinds of people throughout the ages, even some of  the queens of England. Anne Boleyn is presented here more as she might have acted in 2005, it's true. But this is a woman who accomplished something that changed the Western world. She must have been arrogant, strong-willed, and superbly self-confident to get as far as she did. And she died as fearlessly as she lived. Whether you like her or not, she deserves not to be romanticized and to be recognized for the gutsy risk-taker she was.<br />As for the rest of this work, Dunn does a creditable job of bringing a previously shadowy player in this huge drama to life. I'm referring to Mark Smeaton, the court musician accused of adultery with Anne. Dunn's treament of Lucy, a portrayal of life in the royal kitchens, is fascinating and more true to how the modern reader regards the end of the middle ages.<br />\\"Subtleties\\" is not great history. But it IS historical fiction, and I thoroughly enjoyed its entertainment value as a novel.	2005-05-29

Follies, model villages, tombstones - the wierd and the wondrous, the eccentric and rare, and the just plain strange - Timpson has ferretted out hundreds of  little known oddities, photographed them beautifully, and accompanied their pictures with their histories. Bet  you didn't know England has her own copies of the 10 Commandments, carved by Moses himslef. I certainly never heard of the finger-pillory at the church in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, used to keep unruly children in their pew. For that matter, I never knew there was an Ashby-de-la-Zouch!<br /><br />Entertaining and fun. I pick up this book over and over again.	2005-05-29

Few people know, for example, that the sweater is a very new garment style (only about 100 years old) and was designed for and by people who made a living by fishing. Gloves, on the other hand, are quite old. As a museum educator in the field of textiles, I find this work very valuable.	2005-05-29

Not that it's poorly written, it just seems rather formulaic. Simon Brett writes for TV and I think that shows in Death/Downs. The characters are well-delineated, and he manages to sustain a sense of mystery, but somehow the plot  failed to come to life. Actually, the villain isn't very scary. If you like \\"cozy mysteries\\", you might like this more than I did. Not a bad book, but not a great one either.	2005-05-24

The patterns are adaptations of traditional styles and designs from around the world, with well-written directions and explanations of various techniques.

I've found them inspiring. After choosing a pattern to begin with, I enjoyed it and liked the results so much that I knitted 3 or 4 others in different yarns and colors. Scarf Style takes traditional patterns and tweaks them a bit into something new, and presents new scarves in unique shapes and new yarns. Some of the patterns are a bit complex, but the directions are fairly clear and I've been able to meet the challenges. That's how you learn! Very nice collection with many patterns for the money.	2005-05-17

Not a historical novel, not a screenplay, it is intended to inform, not to entertain. If you approach this book with a clear understanding of its purpose, it is quite enjoyable. Eunice Williams' sister Esther, who was also taken captive, moved to the town where I now live and is buried in our oldest cemetery. Her very large tombstone tells something of her story. I've often wondered why, although they are both daughters of a minister who was  kidnapped along with most of their family, Esther and her other siblings came home when given the chance,  but Eunice alone chose to stay. Well, Demos does a good job of inferring possible reasons from 300 year old data. If you find the research boring, it's possible to skim over those parts and read only the narrative of Eunice's story. It's fascinating.	2005-05-09

Godbeer has meticulously researched this event and presents a remarkably detailed story based upon the participants own words. He follows the accusers, the victims, the \\"witches\\", the ministers, and the magistrates, from the beginning of the outbreak to its much-more-sensible-than Salem conclusion. Seems one could be a witch and avoid execution in Olde New England. Puritans all - how did Connecticut avoid hysteria and wanton killing? This brief book tells the tale in an interesting, historically accurate fashion.	2005-05-09

It is, however, a mystery, one that's difficult for the reader to solve because we don't know, nor have many clues to, what the other characters know. This is a fun read, especially because of the (fictionalized) insights into the conflicts among the earliest Plantagenets. Little is actually known about the personalities of these tempestuous people; what is \\"known\\" has to be inferred from their recorded behavior. Who knows what they were really thinking? But I enjoyed this book because it brought them to life, and I found the central character, Alais, quite believable. The plot is somewhat thin, but the settings are interesting and help the amateur medieval historian to visualize even the places that are merely ruins now (Old Sarum, for example) as they might have been when full of life. Healey is a decent writer without the annoying mannerisms that so many writers of popular literature rely upon.	2005-05-03

This is a witty, often amusing little story, with dialog that you can practically hear and a mystery that remains a tantalizing, just-out-of-reach secret until the end. Both of the male characters are vitally human - Katya, the love interest, is superficially charming but strangely wooden, the first clue that something is seriously wrong with  this picture.  The plot epitomizes the old adage that love is blind; although the reader is not sure what the problem is, you know there is one, a discovery that Jean-Marc stubbornly refuses to see until it is literally forced upon him. This book is a little known gem; a quick, enthralling reading experience.	2005-05-03

Viewed through the eyes of 7-year-old Luke, a series of violent incidents, murder, and mysterious secrets give him much to ponder. Luke is a delightful little character, well delineated and wholly believable. Grisham has done a good job in capturing and staying true to Luke's maturity level, and in depicting the hardships inherent in marginal farming communities.  An interesting twist is the fact that none of the plot's conflicts are resolved at the end of the story. This is a harsh yet touching portrait of a still-innocent child's attempt to understand the vagaries of adult behavior.<br />Entertainingly and intelligently read by David Lansbury.	2005-04-30

The witchcraft phenomenon in general is now fairly well understood in terms of its psychodynamics. But what made the Salem tragedy so extreme? I suspect it was a number of factors. Phenomena are rarely simple. In Salem Possessed, the authors do an admirable job of analyzing the social background against which the outbreak occurred, a task that has not been done as thoroughly and minutely in any other source that I've encountered. The sections on the Putnams, the Porters, and Samuel Parris are particularly instructive, and the explanation of these families' relationships with some of the victims is eye-opening. Does this book explain the why's of this traumatic event in American history? Partially, yes. Therefore its value should not be understimated. Salem Possessed is a must-read for any student of Salem.	2005-04-25

Nicci French has (have?) captured the essence of narcissistic personality disorder in Brendan Block, who demands unconditional love but completely unable to love in return.  Manipulation is the key word here. Brendan is adept at charming most of the world into admiring, accepting, and believing in him, especially women. It's what lies beneath that is so dangerous, and Brendan personifies the word \\"creep\\" in all its nuances. Once he realizes that Miranda has seen beyond the mask of his public image,  Brendan is merciless in his attempts to destroy her and those around her, and he is quite successful for a good long time. Only when Miranda learns to use some of his own methodology does she begin to regain control. This is a tightly constructed story written in terse but fluent prose , which sustains its suspense until the very last page. I for one never expected the surprise ending. Very engrossing, pleasurable read. Give it a try.	2005-04-24

Before starting, I expected the plot to be somewhat farfetched, but having worked with young teens for a long time, I can see that something like this could happen. Each of the major characters lacks something important in his/her life, and it takes a tragedy for them each to learn that their resolutions lie not in miracles but in themselves and in each other. The truth of the central mystery remains hidden till the novel's end, and even then, not all questions are answered or problems solved. Thought provoking and skillfully crafted.	2005-04-21

Haunted Ground isn't one of them. The plot is transparent, easy to figure out after only 50 pages or so, and so are the few relationships that Hart attempts to develop.

This is a beautiful story, based upon real people and actual events, beautifully told. Learning how hundreds of Italian citizens, ordinary people, survived the horrors of war and Nazi brutality, and selflessly extended the hand of friendship to those whom they perceived as even more persecuted, was an inspirational experience. Ms Russell's narration is flowing and compelling, and she succeeds in finding and illuminating the humanity in all her characters, including those once guilty of atrocity. There is so much courage in this world that goes unnoticed and unsung. This is a story worth telling.	2005-04-12

Put it on this afternoon and never turned it off. Charing Cross is a delightful memoir, and this reading of it is all the more so as each correspondent's letters are read by a different narrator, all of them wonderful. The quintessential postwar (WW II) New Yorker meets the quintessential Londoner in this series of letters brimming with warmth, wit, and humor. Surprisingly, Helene Hanff did not develop her passion for good literature through conventional educational experience, but via an encounter with A. Quiller-Couch in a library. She would have made a fantastic English lit professor. (The reader of her letters reminds me of Debra Winger in Shadowlands). Frank Doel, his family and co-workers bring the 50's and 60's with all England's deprivation alive, and respond to Helene's heartfelt American generosity in kind. Wish I had read this gem long ago; just glad I've done so at last. Will now begin a search for  my own print copy, hopefully, in an \\"antique\\" edition.	2005-04-05

This second time, I made it to the halfway point. Grenouille is a character so damaged, twisted, repulsive, and pathetic, that it would have been a great blessing had he died at birth. I would go so far as to classify him as sub-human. He certainly can be described as freakish. The other characters are not as dysfunctional, but there isn't an individual in this book that isn't thoroughly selfish. If you don't mind reading about psychological grotesquerie, Perfume is a well-written novel that could be intriguing. Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid.	2005-03-25

He has certainly managed to convey the essence of his 2-1/2  month pilgrimage in only 131 pages. Rudolph describes himself as a man with virtually no belief in \\"miracles or the otherworldly\\", yet  experiences a deep, life altering sense of spirituality on his physically punishing trek.  Simultaneously a travel guide, with practical information and sensible advice,  a brief history of Santiago and the medieval religious psyche, and an insightful, first hand memoir  evoking the texture and trials of the place and the journey. The photos in the second half of the book do much to bring Rudolph's eloquent words to life.

In this sequel to  The Merlin of St Gilles' Well, Jehanne d'Arc, La Pucelle, plays more of a central role as she prepares to set foot upon the world's stage in a role few females have played before. Chamberlin's Joan is a young girl caught up in something so immense that she can't comprehend its beginning, its end, or its meaning.  Her faith, part Christian, part \\"old religion\\", leads her to follow her Voices no matter what the cost. This is a real Joan, a 16-year-old with all the coming of age conflicts of any other young woman, compounded by her mission. No wooden icon here.

Kind of like kids serving in the war in Iraq. What I appreciate about The Once and Future Spy is Littel's depiction of Hale as a flesh and blood, passionate, adventurous young man. While this book may not be great history, and I don't necessarily believe in the accuracy of its speculation about Nathan's doomed spy mission, I do appreciate it for thawing out this frozen icon a little.	2005-02-10

It's light, with oh-so-nice characters, a roguish, impossibly handsome hero, a love-starved but unselfish heroine, and a picturebook setting.  Dr. Jemma Jericho is a single mother with a depressing string of romantic failures, who therefore has walled herself off from everything in the world except her  tiny family and her stressful career. I suppose her cynical nature is understandable, but who could visit Italy and enjoy so little of the experience? Nonna, Jemma's mother, is a boringly stereotypical Italian- American widow who for 20 years has worn nothing but black. The Italian peasants in Tuscany are uniformly warm, happy, salt of the earth types who cook better then Emiral. Life in Tuscany is simple and idyllic.  Jemma's daughter is a cute but derivative teenager. Why the love interest, an artist who is actually named Raphael(!), falls for Jemma, is a mystery to me - could it be that her endearing klutzyness overpowers her dowdiness and lack of any sex appeal? Guess so....<br /><br />But for lovers of the genre, this might be your cup of tea - or cappuccino! Wish I could have liked it better.	2005-02-07

In this first volume of her Merlin series, Ann Chamberlin makes this fact the \\"weft\\" into which she weaves the story of Joan of Arc and the Hundred Years War. Yann le Drapier and Gilles de Rais, the two central characters, form opposite sides of the same coin.  Their adventures, always challenging, dangerous and exciting, always have the good of France as their purpose. While working wholeheartedly toward the same goal, their paths diverge and the two young men develop in very different ways. This is a thoughtful retelling of an old story, an effective attempt at presenting familiar events from the perspective of the medieval mind. The legends surrounding Joan of Arc, who was not canonized until the 20th century, are full of misconceptions. The Merlin of St Gilles Well, although Joan is still a peripheral character at this stage, places her more firmly in her own time and place. For me, this makes her more human and more real. In a similar fashion, the legend of Bluebeard arose from the actions of Gilles de Rais, and it is also interesting to trace that legend from its source and discover how it was transformed over time. The Merlin of St. Gilles' Well can be read on several levels, all of them intriguing.	2005-02-06

I always enjoy Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti novels because she always tells a compelling story about good vs evil, morality vs venality, in the context of Brunetti's life as an incorruptible police officer and devoted husband and father. This particular story is relevant for its subplot involving child abuse by priests, a topic never far from our headlines here in the US. If you are a devout Christian or Catholic, I would advise you not to read this book, for it questions many aspects of Holy Mother Church as it functions today as well as in history. But it is not disrespectful, at least not IMO. Quietlly in Their Sleep is also relevant for its depiction of a functional ( as opposed to dysfunctional) and intact family headed by two working parents of two normal teens. Both Guido and wife Paola are highly intelligent, and while their marriage and their  mutual sense of morality is strong, they quite frequently disagree with one another over the situations that cross their paths as parents and professionals. Quietly in Their Sleep is a mystery with a gripping plot,and its characters and settings are genuine and refreshing, anything but sterotypical. And it's fun to read about everyday life in exotic Venice too.<br />A final comment: I listen to a lot of audio books and often find the narrators irritating. But Anna  Fields  is one of the best.	2005-02-04

The only other author I've read who's as quirky - quixotic - imaginatively creative - as Lily Prior is Jasper Fforde, but the 2 are quite different. Having read La Cucina, I had some idea of what to expect from Ardor. At first it was difficult to accept the premise of mule as narrator, but I gradually became quite fond of Gezebel. The female lead, Fernanda, is introduced as powerful and mysterious and remains so throughout the story. There is also a (human) baby who flies!  Prior does a good job of conveying something of the Italian personality and lifestyle without resorting to stereotype. If you like Italy, strong characterization, potent but not blatently graphic sexuality, AND can suspend the need to be bound by reality, you will probably enjoy Ardor.	2005-01-25

Comprehensive and well-researched, it divides this vast topic into sections dealing with the rise of the pilgrim tradition in Christianity, the most poplular sites and some not so well known, the joys and perils of the journey, the hopes and motivations of the pilgrim, signs and symbols, and the decline of the  pilgrimage in the late middle ages. While I enjoyed reading this volume, which is beautifully illustrated, I also noticed numerous errors in vocabulary, choice of words (eg, \\"parody\\" rather than \\"parallel\\"), and proofing (someone was reported to have drunk the blood of St Thomas Becket!) These signs of sloppy editing were frequent enough to be distracting. Nevertheless, there is much to learn in To Be a Pilgrim, and it is worth a reading for the student of medieval history and religious practices.	2005-01-24

If you are looking for one intelligent, well-educated, American woman's experience, told from the heart, read Kathryn Harrison. I read her slim but captivating volume in 2 hours. She has managed to convey in words, in only 150 pages, the effect that this walk/trek/meditation has had upon her consciousness, not on only one journey, but on three. Her words are luminous and capture slivers of her psyche. Isn't that what pilgrimage is all about?	2005-01-19

Even with the detailed directions provided by the authors, finding most of these hidden, nearly forgotten sites was a challenge. But with persistence and patience, our efforts were rewarded.

Her themes and plot treatments differ from the run-of-the-mill by their focus on moral dilemmas. In Fatal Remedies, there are several such. Guido's wife Paola has decided to take action against the outrageous sex/travel trade to Asia, which involves the exploitation and abuse of young girls. The means she settles upon are in strong and direct conflict with her husband's career and his need to uphold the law regardless of his personal feelings. Leon explores the nature of their marital relationship and the need of husband and wife to maintain separate identities with the freedom of action that that requires. Guido is a profoundly moral man who understands how to love, in contrast to the popularly accepted image of the Italian male. The solution of this novel's crimes and conflicts is surprising, believable, and anything but trite. Character is what makes Leon's writing so satisfying.	2005-01-17

I always plan for our trips by buying and studying  2 guidebooks, one with lots of pictures, and the other, invariably, the Blue Guide to the site in question. Blue Guide England was the first of these, purchased more than 10 years ago. We used that edition as guide book, historical and geographical reference, and atlas. It became so dogeared and highlighted that we were happy when the next edition was published, purchasing it immediately even though we had no immediate plans to return to England. We are independent travellers, almost always booking flights, cars, and reservations on our own on the web. We also enjoy delving into places off the beaten track and the top-ten lists. The detail in any Blue Guide is much more encompassing than that in any other guide we have used. The driving directions are usually right on the money. Its literary, architectural, and historical information is particularly helpful. We have discovered many little known gems because of these guides. Highly recommended, without reservation.	2005-01-12

Having used the first volume in the series, The Knit Stitch, I was happy to find that this second book is just as valuable. One of its best features is the presentation of photos of the same garment done in different yarns and sizes. Patterns are accurate and adaptable, and I find that they stimulate my creativity and interest in customizing them. Though I've been knitting for more than twenty years, the simplicity is far from boring. The Purl Stitch is one of my most useful references, one that I return to time and again.	2005-01-10

She seems to be telling virtually identical stories from a different perspective in each of her Tudor novels. This is a fascinating approach taken by Susan Howatch in her Starbridge church of England series (another excellent series). Gregory also employs it with good effect. While her plots sometimes do bog down, her characters and their motivations are deep and thoughtful, with solid historical fact and plausible psychological insight. It's always a challenge to portray an historical icon, and Gregory does it well. I've found this series to be both entertaining and informative, and have enjoyed all three volumes thoroughly.	2004-12-17

It probably reads better - perhaps more poetically - in the original French, but this seems a decent translation. Sort of a third party stream of consciousness narrative, \\"Love, the Painter's Wife etc\\" deals with the evolution of the artist's creativity, the young queen's growing sense of purpose and mission, and the loss of a love. It attempts, with reasonable success, to depict Piero della Francesco's perceptions of his experiences of the world around him, and the process by which he translates his perceptions into art. It helps if you have access to photographs of Piero's frescos to refer to as you read.  This is a very erudite presentation with musings on the great questions of life. It requires careful thought and sensitivity to nuance to appreciate.	2004-12-15

While most books featuring adolescent protagonists generally fail to capture my interest, this one is different. Hannah is a child forced to become a woman too quickly, which probably happened almost always in times as crushingly brutal as the middle ages. Both commoners and royalty are portrayed in this book as all too human, caught up in the sweep of politics and intrigue. Hannah does behave foolishly and impetuously, but then she is merely a young girl living in fear and struggling to survive in what amounts to a pit of vipers. I found her story compelling and sympathetic, losing myself in her world every time I picked the book up. Philippa Gregory is a master at portraying the dark side of the human personality, especially in women. Her Bloody Mary is neither good nor evil, simply a woman deprived of love and clinging to her religion in desperation. Her Elizabeth I is calculating and intelligent, willing to do what is necessary to become queen, as all politicans and persons of power must do. The Queen's Fool, while not perfect, is worthy of attention.	2004-11-24

Her account, while sometimes dry, is detailed and factual, and provides insight into the process that led Elizabeth eventually to execute her cousin, against the dictates of her own wishes and conscience. The reader is left wondering if she would have had the strength to order Mary's death if she had met her face to face. Mary, on the other hand, is presented as a lone individual thrust into power with no training and no one to provide her with guidance and reliable counsel. It is no wonder that she made the foolish, ultimately fatal decisions that brought about her downfall.	2004-11-24

Most of the developments upon which the story twists and turn were formulaic and predictable. Sylvia's character is one-dimensional, and the adventures in which she participates would never be remotely possible in a real life setting. The other characters simply hover around Sylvia, who calls the shots for police, forensics, FBI,other psychiatrists, and the rest of a large but poorly defined cast of supporters. Even sociopath John Dantes comes across as wooden, as he helplesslessly becomes enamoured of Sylvia while trying to manipulate her.

The old English speech patterns, though effective, do slow down comprehension of the plot, which centers upon 2 romances blossoming amongst a plague epidemic in 17th century England. As an avid but adult reader of medieval/Renaissance history, I can say that this book is a wonderful presentation of the experience of surviving amongst the hardships of everyday life,  the Protestant religious conflicts, and the horrors of the plague and other catastrophic illnesses that  no one could understand or effectively treat. I'd recommend this title to adults more than to teenagers, except to teens with a special interest in medieval history.	2004-11-13

Yes, the yarns used in the photos are expensive, but there are so many cheaper but still lovely substitutes on the market these days, that cost doesn't have to be prohibitive, and you can still attain great looks.

Many patterns written for use with commercial yarns simply don't work with handspun. The patterns in this little book are classic, adaptable, and well suited to the special characteristics of hand made yarns, which tend to be less elastic and \\"drapey\\" than factory products.

I refer to Homespun Handknit frequently, and the family mitten pattern is one I've made in homespun dozens of times, always with excellent results.	2004-11-12

His assessment of frontier conditions at the time helps the reader take the perspective and mind-set of the town.

As a murder mystery, Strong as Death is fairly easy to decipher. But as other Amazon reviewers have explained so well, Sharan Newman's forte lies in her ability to convey the atmosphere and ambience of everyday life in the 12th century. Her characterization of myriad individuals, nationalities, religions, professions, and relationships is sensitive and credible. Her treatment of the ever present conflict between Jews, Christians, and Muslims appears fair and balanced. Newman's prose style is flowing and enables the reader to become immersed right from the start. Well-worth a look.	2004-09-12

I also admire her books because, while they could be written according to a single formula, as so many authors so tiresomely  do, hers are all remarkably different. Holy Fools is darker than some of Harris' earlier work, and her treatment of the psychology of group dynamics here is intriguing and realistic. I can often guess the outcome of books involving mysterious death, but there are so many holy fools in this story that it had me guessing to the end, brought about with the help of a  miracle. Is it a genuine miracle? You must decide for yourself. I still haven't made up my mind.	2004-09-09

Although the book is written at a young adult level, the language is not too simplistic and the characters are appealing to readers of any age. Ms Jones' metaphors are both practical and poetic. Cat and Christopher's experiences as they discover their surprising powers are highly entertaining, and their confusion (they are only children) is endearing.

The writing is intelligent and the main character, Richard Browne, is well explored. His uncertainty and mis-steps are particularly appealing. Most of the detail regarding life in 17th century New England is accurate. Once the plot line is laid out, however, the story never goes anywhere else, sinking into 100 pages of dialogue and inner monologue. The solution to the mystery is provided halfway through, and there is no sense of climax or resolution. A pity that a book with such a promising beginning ends on such a flat note.	2004-08-25

An engrossing narration about  the extraordinary measures ordinary people can and will resort to, to  stay alive and to do what they think is right. Encouraging, inspiring, and highly recommended.	2004-08-21

Allusions to Shakespeare effortlessly incorporated. Vivid characters. Fresh, memorable metaphors. A touch of magic. Innocence. Deviltry. All this, plus a plot that twists, turns, and makes you laugh and think at the same time. Love in Idleness is good enough to warrant a second perusal, just to catch the delicious detail missed in the first reading.	2004-08-11
US	37497635	R2W8C0201US114	0440236290	510541516	Thief of Souls	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Enduring Morality	An admirer of Ann Benson's meticulously researched work, I became hooked on Thief of Souls from the very first page, which is unusual for me. The plot shifts rapidly between two parallel stories, each of which traverses rocky ethical, legal, and moral terrain. The heroines are two intensely humanistic women whose lives vary greatly, but who share the characteristic of willingness to sacrifice self-interest for the greater good of the communities in which they work and live. It is difficult to decide which story is the more compelling, and at the end of each chapter, I had to wrench my interest away from the one conflict in order to focus again on the other. In this &quot;all about me&quot; era, it is refreshing and heartening to immerse oneself in a tale of selflessness, dogged determination, and devotion to the good of others	2004-08-03

When, 9 or 10 years back, I came across the Brother Cadfael story about the theft of the bones of St. Winifred in Wales, I didn't realize how commonplace this sort of chicanery and piracy actually was. Patrick Geary presents a readable, informative account of hagiography, the engineering of miracles, cults of the saints, financial considerations, and most intriguing, the travels, adventures, and translations of the corpses and body parts of many of Europe's best known holy personages.	2004-06-30

As an inveterate visitor of ancient churches, what I've found invaluable is Visser's thorough lesson on how to read a church, especially an Italian Catholic one. I disagree that Sant'Agnese fuori le Mure is an &quot;ordinary&quot; church; its layers of history, folklore, language, mysticism, and symbolism have accumulated over many centuries, and the building itself is a treasure. Reading Geometry of Love answered many of the questions I had about religious, archaeological, and artistic traditions and also raised some new ones. But now when I enter an old Italian church I am better equipped to notice and interpret its many layers of nuance and meaning.	2004-06-28

He has brought a fresh approach to the  British mystery tradition. Central character Merrily Watkins is a modern woman, Anglican priest, and single mother.  Rickman has created a real person, one to whom it is easy to relate. Merrily struggles with many of the issues that plague Western society.  Spiritual uncertainty, the problems of divorce, working motherhood,  sexism, and social injustice all color her decisions and actions. How to be a good (female) priest. How to be a good mom.  How to find a life partner. What is love? What is evil? Who is evil? Is demonic possession a reality? Is exorcism a valid response to it? Rickman knows well his psychology, religion, folklore, and history. He can be relied upon to create a literate, compelling story with believable characters and relevance for today.	2004-06-24

The characterizations are a bit shallow, with the exception of Pliny Elder, who is brought to life as a living person rather than the historical icon he'd always been to me. Some of the excesses of Roman society are set forth in a truly revolting fashion! What this book does so well is place the reader on the Bay of Naples, from the initial portents of the volcanic eruption, through the inferno with its deadly hail of rocks, to its completion and the smothering of the cities and their inhabitants. Makes it all real. The only other description of doom and destruction that I've seen done so well is the harrowing artillery bombardment presented by Michael Shaara in \\"The Killer Angels\\".	2004-06-24
US	37497635	RHC4SSARY15UW	1552782980	420257446	Paris Requiem	Books	3	10	14	N	N	Just OK.	The premise of this story is intriguing. James Norton, a young attorney from Boston has been sent by his domineering mother to  Paris, where his newsman brother and ailing sister are living as ex-pats and he is to make them return home. James's brother is deep in grief over the recent, violent death of his  fiancee, an actress from a Jewish immigrant family. The plot delves into illicit medical research, racial prejudice, dysfunctional family relationships, and investigative journalism, and its depiction of turn of the century Paris is fascinating. The characters, however, are strangely flat, and I never really grew to care about any of them. It was also easy to solve the crime by the midpoint of the book. Worth a look, but certainly not &quot;gripping&quot;, &quot;lavish&quot;, or &quot;chilling&quot;, as promised on the cover notes.	2004-06-23

But it's quick to read and somewhat entertaining. Something light and undemanding to read at the beach or on the train. And it's been remaindered. I've read worse.	2004-06-23

I didn't find the answer (probably too much to hope for), but the book does provide a thorough compilation of the possibilities. Butler's style is smooth and readable, and he does a commendable, objective job of analyzing the facts. To his credit, he does not try to &quot;sell&quot; his own ideas on which of the scenarios is most likely. A worthwhile study of one of history's enduring mysteries.	2004-06-21
US	37497635	R1K9XVQS7BXRIJ	0451168690	662615077	Mystery	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Best of the Trilogy	I've never understood why Straub is considered a horror writer. His books can be arcane, mystical, compelling, and mysterious, but gruesome or frightening I've never found them to be. &quot;Mystery&quot; is his best, IMHO. Tom and his grandfather Lamont experience an immediate, subliminal meeting of mind and spirit, though Tom does not become cognizant of their kinship for quite some time. I have to confess to some confusion in some sections of the plot, but it plays itself out with subtlety and holds one's interest to the end. Intriguing.	2004-06-19

Protagonist Alessandro is deeply and authentically  human, a strong but sensitive man caught in a vicious machine, all the while struggling to maintain his humanity when constantly chllenged bythe degradations of war. This book reads like a movie and would make a fine screenplay. Not to be missed.	2004-06-11

The first few chapters lived up to my expectations, providing well-researched and documented information about the life of these nuns, those with a vocation and those with little choice. The writer's style is also very readable. My problem with this book is that it became heavily redundant, to the point that it became a chore to reach the last page. Managed to finish it, with determination.	2004-06-11

The author's &quot;style&quot; is coy and over the top, and her portrayal of Italians is condescending and patronizing. It was hard to believe anything but the bare bones of this story.<br />Could not force myself to finish. Life is too short to read bad books.	2004-06-06

As it develops, however, the plot grows entirely  predictable, which diminishes the reader's sense of mystery. Conflicts are resolved rather abruptly, and except for Julia Garnet herself, characters are incompletely developed. If you love Italy and religious symbolism, though, this is an easy and fun read.	2004-06-06
