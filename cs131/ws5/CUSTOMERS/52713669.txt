Storm Constantine creates a fully believable world, filled with exotic cultures and even more exotic characters that you will come to love.  <br />Wraeththu is told from first person perspective, which I enjoy, and is broken into three books.   Each is told from the perspective of a very different character. First is Pellaz the innocent young man, who introduces us to Wraeththu culture even as he is introduced to it, himself. Next is Swift, a first generation Wraetthu with whom we see the upheaval and maturing of the Wraetthu culture, and learn further secrets of this strange new race.  Finally it wraps up with Calanthe, the chaotic har who is the catalyst for most of the action in all three books. He brings the story to a very satisfying close.  <br />A warning though, if you dislike sex in your books, there is a strong sexual element that is integral to the story.  It is not graphic nor gratuitous, in my opinion, but it is definitely there and it is non-traditional.  You will need an open mind to fully enjoy these books. <br />All I can say is that if you are looking for something different and good you will find it here!	2004-05-07

The action comes fast and furious in Thief of Lives, but the characters of Leesil and Magiere remain at the heart of the story, and that is the reason I love this series so much!  The main characters come alive and grow and change throughout the book. A new cast of supporting characters are introduced as well. I especially liked Wynn, an intelligent young woman sage, and Vatz, a feisty young man--both of whom are willing to risk their lives to fight the undead alongside Magiere and Leesil.  <br />This book focussed slightly more on Leesil, revealing intriguing glimpses into his past. More of Magiere's strange Dhampir abilities are revealed.  You will also learn shocking secrets about Chap and Welstiel, and revisit old enemies from Dhampir, and new ones as well, when Leesil and Magiere are hired by the city of Bela to deal with a mysterious murder of a nobleman's daughter, and find themselves fighting the undead again.  <br />I cannot wait to read the next book!  I cannot recommend this series highly enough to those who love character driven stories with a lot of action and a touch of romance.  However, I do recommend that you read Dhampir first, in order to fully enjoy Thief of Lives.	2004-01-17

There is something in it to appeal to every reader.  A little horror, a little SF, a little mysticism, even a touch of romance.  <br />The main character, David Valentine, is an elite soldier on a near future earth that has been turned on its ear.  Man is no longer at the top of the food chain--he has become prey to turncoat humans, genetically created monsters called grogs, the menacing, vampiric Reapers and the alien Kurian masters.  He is of the first generation never to have known life without the fear of the Reapers.  <br />The book shows his development from childhood, through his training, and into young adulthood.  He is chosen by a good Kurian, a Lifeweaver, to become a Wolf, an elite warrior with the finely honed senses and strength of a wolf. His job--to help destroy the minions of the Kurians and protect the safety of the Free Territory.  <br />The post-apocalyptic world and the characters of this book ring true.  You see the best and worst of human nature close up.  And although the world under the Kurians is a violent and unpredictable place, there are still flashes of happiness and humor and love as humanity survives and adapts to life under the world's new masters.  And David is a true hero that anchors this at times grim and violent book with a human heart.  <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a well-spun, fast-paced adventure tale!	2003-09-28

If the last book in this series ended on a triumphant note for Rani, this is the book where she pays the price for all that has come before.  This is definitely Rani's story in this book and all other characters fade into the background, although we do get glimpses into the strange workings of the mind of Princess Berylina.  <br />She accompanies the exiled Princess Berylina, a strange girl who sees and speaks with the 1,000 Gods, on an ill fated pilgrimmage to the homeland of Jair.  Then unexpectedly the prize of becoming a Master of Glasswrights is dangled before her nose and she takes the bait.  Little does she know that the mysterious Fellowship of Jair is pulling strings behind the scenes, trapping her into a position where she must do as they ask or forfeit her mastery and the life of someone dear to her.  And all they ask is something that means betrayal of her core loyalty to her King and Queen...<br />She struggles in this book, trying to keep all the promises and oaths and loyalties she has created over the last few books.  She is torn between oaths of support to Hal, Tovin, Crestman, Berylina, Mair, the Fellowship of Jair, and the Glasswright's guild.  In trying to keep pledges to them all, she hurts and loses almost all of them.  Her loyalty to Hal is tested to its limits and rather than take a firm stand on who and what means most to her, she tries tricks and manipulation, with some terrible results. <br />Ranita Glasswright is an imperfect heroine, trying to do her best in a world where she has little real power and where the are plots with plots all around her.<br /> I cannot wait to read what happens next to this multi-faceted and fascinating character!	2003-06-13

I just recently discovered Megan Sybil Baker/Linnea Sinclair's books, and they are all fantastic. Still, I think this is my favorite of them all so far!<br />Gilliane Devre is the Kiasidera, a sorceress whose mageline has been dedicated to watching over and aiding the Khalar people for thousands of years. Gillie was involved in a space battle with enemy wizards, and when she destroyed them, she and her sentient crystal ship got thrown in a time warp forward 340 years.  When the sassy, down-to-earth Captain awakens, she is horrified to learn that the Khalar people now worship her as a Goddess! <br />She tries to hide her identity and fit in, clashing several times with the handsome Admiral Rhynan Makarian, who has suspicions that she is a smuggler.   Complications ensue--sparks fly between Rhynan and Gillie, treacherous plots are uncovered, and ships clash in space, as Gillie again finds herself nearly sacrificing everything to fulfill her role as protectress of the Khalar people.<br />This books has a fascinating mix of SF and Fantasy elements, and has more than enough action to please any SF fan.  The characters come alive on the page, which seems to be true of all her books.  This lady really knows how to create memorable characters.  This was just an incredibly fun book to read!<br />A note:  While this is technically a sequel to Wintertide, it stands alone nicely.  I did enjoy the &quot;historical&quot; references to events that happened in Wintertide. Reading it first is not necessary, but it would enhance your reading experience.  Plus I know that once you read any of her books, you will want to read them all!	2003-04-19

I know the word romance is trumpeted all over this book, but this is far from your typical \\"futuristic\\" romance book.  It is NOT 200 pages of groping and heavy breathing with 3 pages describing a generic SciFi setting.<br />Yes, there is a terrific romance between the two main characters with lots of sparks and verbal sparring, but there is also a good solid SF plot filled with intrigue, deception, and danger that drives this novel. The characters really come alive and there are even some edge of your seat battles in space.   This author has got all the elements just right for a really fun read!  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed the Liaden books by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller. <br />Also try her other books:  Destiny's Game (wonderful even though it was too short!!)and Command Performance (I want a furzel!) She also writes under the name Megan Sybil Baker, and I look forward to reading those with anticipation!  Why hasn't a major publisher checked this lady out!??!	2003-04-09

This book is a promising beginning to a great new adventure series.  Magiere and her half-elf sidekick Leesil have been making a dishonest living running scams on foolish superstitious villagers whom Magiere promises to rid of evil spirits--for a stiff fee. Having spent her life persecuted by superstitious fools, she feels little remorse at taking advantage of what she views as their stupidity in believing in something she is sure does not exist. At the start of the book, she tires of this kind of life and decides to buy an inn and settle down.  Little does she realize it, but the town she chooses is also the home of a nest of undead vampires, and they recognize her for what she really is--a Dhampir--a slayer of undead, and they quickly move to elimate her.  Only if she comes to terms with her true self will Magiere and those dear to her survive what is coming...<br />Magiere and Leesil are fascinating characters.  Both have been badly hurt in their childhoods and their motivations and feelings are well drawn.  They are not perfect--Leesil drinks to deaden memories of his terrible deeds in his sad past, he picks pockets and routinely gambles away all his money.  Magiere resists getting involved, is quite selfish at the start, scamming poor villagers of thier life savings. They make some missteps and people die. Both of them change over the course of the book from bitter loners to the kind of people you can truly call heroes.  <br />And these two people are made for each other! While there is no obvious romance in this book, but I am hoping for a bit of romance between them in future volumes--there are definite hints of it here!  <br />Secondary characters are well designed too, brave Beth Rae and Brendan, even the vampires are given at least some background and bits of history.  These characters are not just cardboard cutouts.  <br />Fans of Patricia Briggs and Dawn Cook will probably enjoy this book--the characterization and writing style is similiar.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope there will be more adventures of the captivating main characters!	2003-03-01
US	52713669	R2GHULGBV1083U	193169656X	244476468	Tyrant Moon	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Fun romantic fantasy	I just finished this book and enjoyed it thoroughly.  <br />The plot revolves around two central characters, Arrow, a female barbarian champion, and Thraxis, an extremely proud wizard.  The author is very adept at making the the characters realistic.  Neither is perfect--in fact, their quest is really to correct horrible, tragic events that they, themselves, helped set in motion out of fear and pride.  <br />Arrow, because of feelings of inadequacy due to being a rare female champion, blindly follows a bloody leader, sowing death among innocent people. She even allows a renegade wizard to change her into a berserker because she fears failure so greatly.  Finally she cannot stomach the horrible orders of her chief and flees to find help to right the wrongs she has helped cause.<br />Thraxis is sent to help her.  Once the most proud and powerful of the wizards, he is now crippled by a death spell, and has been left nearly powerless. (He brought this on himself by being heartless toward the very wizard who later went renegade and stirred up Arrow's clan!)  He still feels superior to this barbarian woman whom he has been forced to help.  Needless to say, these two have a lot of clashes and misunderstandings.  <br />You will have to read the book to find out if these two people can ever become a team strong enough to take on a renegade warlord, his army, and a powerful wizard!<br />My only tiny quibble with this book, and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5, is that while all the characters, main and secondary, are wonderfully drawn, the author does not give me enough picture of the physical lands the heroes travel through.  Just the vaguest of outlines--forest, town, plains.  I would have loved a little more detail of places and things. <br />But overall I loved the book and I will be rereading this one!	2002-12-26

I will just say that once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down. <br />The little librarian hero, Wick, careens from adventure to adventure with almost nonstop action.  Yet the author does not neglect the characters.  Wick is wonderful to read about, and he is surrounded by a cast of equally colorful characters.  A warning, though, this book only gives hints at the huge backstory of the world Wick travels. Some readers may find this to be frustrating, as they are used to the current fad in fantasy of massive books telling every detail of a world from every possible point of view.  I, however, enjoy a bit of mystery and puzzle to my stories and enjoyed trying to figure out things along with Wick!  <br />I do hope Mel Odom writes more about Wick and his world.  This book, while nicely wrapped up at the end, left me longing to know more of this world!	2002-11-16

I first read this collection of three of Judith Tarr's best books back in the late 1980's.  They are a little melodramatic at times, but I really enjoyed them. <br />The main characters are all incredibly well drawn, especially Alfred, the pious monk turned into a reluctant elven warrior &amp; mage.  He wrestles with his own self doubt and the state of his soul throughout the books, even as he changes lives for the better all around him.  Sometimes, like his female foil, Thea,  you just want to shake him and wake him up to the fact that someone soulless would never do so much good in the world--no matter what the church believes!  <BR> <BR>Alfred is a foundling who is raised by monks, and becomes a very learned and pious monk himself.  His writings are praised by the Pope himself.  Alfred eventually realizes that he is not aging and is, in fact, an immortal elf.  If he believes his church teachings, then he is a soulless being.  He grapples with this throughout the book.  He has an encounter with others of his kind, nursing a prince of his kind back to health and meeting a fiery tempered elf woman, Thea.  He is mortified that he is attracted to her--he had thought the vow of chastity to be the easiest of his vows, because he was never drawn to mortal women.  He turns down the position as abbot, believing himself to be unworthy. (Those who raised him and grew up with him accept and love him as he is without a qualm--they know in their hearts that he is a power for good.)  He then sets off to figure his life out.  He is swept into the train of  Richard the Lion-hearted later into the Crusades and to Rome.  He is nearly burned by the church, becomes a great warrior, discovers his magical abilities, and finally learns to accept himself and the love of the elf woman who has been following him since their first encounter back at the abbey.   <br />Don't miss this chance to read this book in this bargain omnibus form.

It covers Menolly's first days at Harper Hall.  As the only female harper apprentice, she struggles to fit in, making both friends and enemies.  Under the wise guidance of her beloved Master Robinton, she comes to realize what great talent she has, and comes to believe in herself.  She blossoms into a confidant young woman, secure in her musical talent and her value, ready to take the next step and become a Journeywoman.  I love the characters in this book--especially the young scamp Piemur, who becomes Menolly first friend and ally in the hall, and, of course, Master Robinton.  Once again McCaffrey crafts her books with a loving attention to all her characters, no matter how minor.  They all have personality and seem real.  That seems to be a hallmark of all her best books.	2002-08-30

Ms. McCaffrey's collection of short stories, Get Off the Unicorn, is a treasure trove of great little stories.  Some of them, like Daughter,  Dull Drums, and Finder's Keeper are great example of McCaffrey's skill at creating characters you love in just a handful of pages.  One story that really hit home for me was called A Proper Santa Claus.  It is about a very creative young boy who is very gently crushed by the adults about him into what they believe is a proper use of his talent.  The end always makes me cry.  I think all teachers and parents should be made to read this story!<BR> <BR>But the coolest part of this excellent collection of short stories is that it is the source for several of her best series:<BR>Apple -- The Talent Series<BR>Thorns of Barevi -- The Freedom Series <BR>Lady in the Tower -- The Rowan<BR>A Meeting of  Minds --  Damia<BR> <BR>And there is even a Pern story, The Littlest Dragonboy and a Brainship story called Honeymoon about Helva and Niall Parollan.

The heroine of the two previous books, Menolly, now a confidant journeywoman, does appear and has some wonderful romantic moments, but it mainly revolves around her friend,the charming, young scamp Piemur.  He believes his beautiful Soprano voice is his only asset to the Harper Hall.  When his voice begins to break, he feels at a loss, but finds out that his ingenuity and intelligence are just as valued by the Masterharper Robinton as his youthful voice was.  After a period of rough adjustment and a violent encounter with jealous rival apprentices, Piemur's other talents gain him a fire lizard and take him farther from the Hall than he ever dreamed--all the way to the mysterious Southern continent of Pern.

After all, who ever heard of a girl harper?   She is even beaten for making music!  Unable to live in misery any longer, she runs away and begins an adventure that will take her from a coastal fire lizard cave, to Benden Weyr, and finally to the place she has always longed for--Harper Hall!

In this castle, though, it is a prince that needs kissed and awakened before this beauty and the rest of the castle can be roused.  Against her will, he recruits his smart, tomboyish cousin, Vevila, (whom he finds trying to run away from her suitors) to help him wake the prince with her kiss.   From that point, much of the story focusses on the strong-willed Princess Vevila and the Princess Tests she is put through by the prince's &quot;protectress&quot;, a fairy godmother with a few psychiatric problems.  A mysterious swamp dweller, a cute, nameless, short man, an imposter perfect princess, a wicked stepmother desperate to find princes for her daughters, and a trio of pompous, greedy wizards round out the cast.  <br />There is a lot of story packed into this small package!

First a warning--this book has graphic violence, a complex plot, and a confusing tendency to use names like Saetan, Daemon, Hell, and Lucivar which have absolutely no connection to what the names mean in the normal context. This was really offputting for me and I kept debating on buying this book for quite a while, but I am glad I finally did!  <BR> <BR>And now on to the plot!    <BR>The Blood of Terrielle were once the guardians of the land.  The Warlord Princes and the lesser blood protected their Witch, and in turn the witch cherished them and the land.  But after hundreds of years of treachery and deception by one powerful and ambitious witch, Dorotea,  hatred and distrust now rule the land where she is the ultimate and unchallenged ruler. <BR>Under this warped, evil woman,  males, through rape and cruelty, now break witches before they come into their power, and those witches who escape this fate enslave and torment the males out of vengeance in an endless circle of distrust and fear.<br />Into this land of horror is born Jaenelle Angelline, a loving and innocent girl, destined to be the most powerful Witch ever and savior of the land.  She can pass at will from land to land, even into the land of the undead.  She is befriended and taught by the High Lord of Hell, sworn enemy of Dorotea, and she sees wonders like unicorns and telepathic beasts.  And she learns not to tell a soul about her strange experiences, for her own family comes to believe her to be mad and they repeatedly lock her away in Briarwood for treatments.  Briarwood, where young, helpless, highstrung witches are sent for treatments, and come out mindless and passive, if they come out at all...<BR>But Jaenelle is not without defenders for in her travels she has met winged Lucivar, an enslaved Eyrian Warlord Prince, and Daemon, a handsome warlord prince sent to Jaenelle's home to act as a household bedslave by Dorotea.  Both recognize in her the potential to be Witch and will do anything, even endanger their own lives and sanity to save her from the unspeakable evil she has faced alone for so long.	2002-04-22

I recommend it to anyone who liked Stardoc!<BR> <BR>Dr. Georgory Marchey is a Bergmann Surgeon, an extremely talented physician who sacrificed his hands in order to do miracle surgery that saves lives no one else can save, but at at a terrible cost to both doctor and patient. <BR> <BR>He is treated as a machine, and feared by all due to the strange nightmarish psychological effects of this new way of doing surgery.

While not quite as good as her previous Book, The Unlikely Ones, this book is still a fun and entertaining book about the adventures of a group of misfits and ugly ducklings.<BR>It features an overweight heroine, Summer, who inherits a magic ring from her unknown father when her mother, the village &quot;kept woman&quot;, dies.  She is given the choice of taking over her mother's job, or leaving, so she leaves to find her own way in the world.  <BR>The mysterious ring allows her to communicate with animals and she acquires an oddball entourage of a smart mouthed, know it all dog, a broken-down horse, a crippled pigeon, a battered tortoise, and a flying pig.  She rescues a blind, amnesiac knight, whom she falls for.  Everyone changes greatly over the course of the story--especially that flying pig, and the end is not quite what you expect it to be.  I really enjoyed reading a book that features an overweight heroine--you don't see those too often!	2002-04-22

This is a book that I kept putting on back on the shelf, mostly due to the strange, cold cover art.  But I am glad I gave it a second chance.<br /><br />The angels of the title are supposed to be protectors of the land of Samaria, enforcing the peace of the land and ascending to the skies and singing to the \\"God\\" in order to request everything from medicine, to rain, to lightening bolts to punish evildoers.  Each person born in Samaria, except for the nomadic Edori tribespeople, are fitted with a jewel at birth that heats and glows when they meet their god-intended mate.  Every year, in order to prove that the peace of the land has been kept, representatives of all the people in the land must gather at the Plains of Sharon and all must raise their voices in song.  If any race is not represented, ...[God's] vengeance will destroy the world.<br /><br />The word has come from God through the oracles that it is time a new Archangel, Gabriel, to become leader of all the angels.  But first the oracle must choose his wife, and there is a problem, for the ordained wife-to-be, Rachel, is nowhere to be found....  The path to love for these two is rocky, and complicated by the treachery of one powerful angel lord.  A corrupt angel has decided that the god of Samaria does not exist, and decides to finally prove it to the world even if that means Rachel must die.<br /><br />The sequels to this book delve deeper into the nature of the God of Samaria and the angels.  They are still good reads, however, the relationships in them do not have nearly as much heart as the one between predjudiced Rachel and proud Gabriel!	2002-04-21

I must say that this was easily one of the best books I have read in years.  <BR>First I must say that this is not a book for the prudish or squeamish.  There is some very strong sexual content and violence, however, it is all very integral to the plot.<BR>The story is seen totally through the eyes of Phedre, a courtesan and spy raised in the Night Courts of the kingdom of Terre D'Ange, a land founded by fallen angels.  In this land, the supreme command of their God is \\"Love as Thou Wilt\\", and there are 13 houses of courtesans, each with a different attitude towards sex, from Joy to elegance to mysticism, and, yes, even S&M, who support this commandment.  Phedre is marked by Kushiel's dart as an anguisette, one who takes pleasure from pain.  She is indentured in the service of Anafiel no'Delauny who protects her and teaches her how to use her intelligence and bedskills to extract information from his enemies.  Intrigue and treachery are everywhere and Phedre finds herself in the thick of it, when she and Delauney are betrayed by one close to them.  Her travels take her from her homeland to the harsh Skaldi northlands to the isles of Alba and back to her beloved Terre D'Ange, accompanied by an ever increasing number of faithful followers, as she races against time to save the land she loves from treacherous betrayers.  <BR>This book is beautifully written, the intrigues are direly clever, and Phedre, for all her strange quirks, is a joy to read about.  I recommend this book highly!	2002-04-21

This is another story that reads like a fairy tale.  <BR>In a faraway cave a dragon lies in deep despair,  for his life's quest had been to gather 5 priceless gems, and they have been stolen.  He cannot return to his homeland without them.<BR> <BR>In a dank cottage, 5 unlikely heroes are enslaved by an evil witch through very painful pebbles embedded in their flesh.  They are Thing, a twisted girl deemed so hideous that she always wears a mask, Corby, the black crow, Puddy, the toad, Moglet, the timid kitten, and Pisky, the golden fish.  They have no memory of their past and have learned over time to communicate amongst themselves.  <BR>When the villagers band together to burn the witch, our heroes escape and set out to solve the mystery of how to remove the pebbles that are causing them such agony.  Along the way they meet two others harmed by the witch.  The first is a hornless unicorn, whose whose horn was destroyed and companion was slain by the witch.  The second is a knight cursed by the witch because he spurned her.  His curse is to have rusty armor, a blunt sword, and all desire unfulfilled until he weds the ugliest creature in the land.  <BR>Many adventures follow and each member of the group meets a challenge that only they can face, until the mystery of the pebbles is solved. Unlike most books, the fulfillment of the quest is not quite the end, as in the real world each one must find their own happiness in the end.  <BR>A very good book with a bittersweet ending.	2002-04-21

This is a book that I originally bought when it was packaged as an adult fantasy novel with a lovely Boris Vallejo cover.  It has since been changed to a children's format and labeled ages 9-12 which is sad because I believe many adults who would love this story will overlook it due to its new age labels and format.<br />First, what this book is not--it is not a slam, bam action book or gigantic doorstopper epic.<BR>What it is--a wonderful romantic retelling of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast.  A widower has three daughters, Grace, Hope, and Honour.  As a young child, Honour decides that her name is boring and states she would rather be Beauty, and the nickname stuck with her.  Kindly Grace and Hope grow up into great beauties, but Beauty grows into a gawky ugly duckling, little concerned with her looks, but proud of her intelligence and way with horses. They all live happily in the city until disastor strikes and they lose almost all their possessions.  They move to the country next to a mysterious old forest and as years pass become used to hard work and the peasant life. Beauty thrives, but still suffers from low self esteem.  Then their father goes back to the city to check on one of his lost ships and when he returns, brings her a beautiful rose.  You know the story--he met the Beast who demanded one of his daughters in exchange for the father's life, because he dare to pluck the rose.<br />Beauty volunteers to got to the Beast, taking only her warhorse turned plowhorse, Great Heart.  She meets the Beast and encounters all the mysteries of his strange castle and invisible servants, some fearful and some wondrous.  A sweet and charming romance ensues as the Beast asks her every night for her hand in marriage.<br />The author really makes the character of Beauty come to life--her wry, self-deprecating humor, her love of nature and books, her wonder, and sometimes fear of, the magic surrounding her, the gentle changing and unfolding of her feelings about the Beast. And the Beast is just as wonderful, you can feel his sad yearning for love, his hard-earned wisdom, his patience with Beauty and her fears, his strength and temper and sorrow.   There is wit and humor, sadness and joy.  This is just a wonderful book that I read again and again.	2001-11-24

A beautiful story with a fairy tale feel and a bit of romance, this has become one of my favorite books.  This tale tells the story of a young woman, Coriel, the bastard child of a now dead nobleman, who is torn between the world of riches and power in the Regent's court and a simple life as the trainee of her grandmother, a small village healer.  Every summer she lives as a noble at Castle Auburn with her beautiful and loving half sister, Elisandra, who is affianced to Prince Bryan, the most adored young men in the Kingdom.  Bryan, the young orphan prince, is just getting his first tastes of power, and likes it very much.<br />The story opens with most of the main characters embarking on a hunt for Aliora, a kind of very gentle and kind fairy folk who are used as slaves by the nobles. Coriel is a young 14-year old tomboy suffering from her first hopeless crush--on Bryan, the reckless and dashing young prince.  The Prince's cousin, slim and serious Kent, keeps a watchful eye on Corie, and tries to curb his cousin's recklessness.  Corie's Uncle Jaxon, the greatest Aliora hunter in the kingdom, herds the youngsters along, and Roderick, a young, handsome guardsman provides security.  Only beautiful Elisandra is kept at home by her mother Greta, in order to avoid scandal.<br />The story follows these innocent children as they change and grow into adults.  Some learn wisdom, some fall in love, one learns evil, and one will die, before the tale is told.  And we see all this through Corie's eyes, overshadowed by her innocence until the blinders are removed and she finally grows up and sees the reality of life in Castle Auburn.	2001-11-24

First, be warned that this story is not set in the same world as the Black Jewels trilogy.  It is much less violent and dark, and the characters are slightly less engaging.  It is set in a new and unique world where the fae cross back and forth from their world to the world of men much like Greek Gods.  But something is causing pieces of the fae world to vanish into mist, and all the fae who dwell in those places are lost. The remaining leaders of the fae, the Lightbearer, Lucien, and Dianne, the Lady of the Moon, are searching for the reason the bridges are being closed.  The Muse and the Bard keeping hearing rumors of Wiccanfae, and the failing of the Pillars of the World, but the flighty fae have long since forgotten what these are or how to fix them.<br />Meanwhile in the human world, an evil man, called the &quot;Witch's Hammer&quot; has rapidly gained power by organizing witch hunts and destroying and perverting all magic in the land that he finds.  The witches have power over the elements and he hates and envies them.  He tortures them into making &quot;confessions&quot; of evil deeds and then kills them. All women walk in fear of him and his witch hunters.    <BR>  <BR>But above all this is the story of the young witch, Ari, the young maiden witch, who has recently lost her mother and her grandmother, and now stuggles to carry on the rites to protect the land alone. She encounters the growing hostility of the townspeople.  She must choose between her new careless fae lover, Lucien, who is just learning the meaning of love, and a young man who truly loves her selflessly, and wishes to take her to safety.  Unknowingly, she also has the clues as to what exactly the pillars of the world are, but the witchhunters are coming and she may not survive to pass this crucial information on. <br />This is a good story, with a wonderful cast of characters like those that I have become used to seeing in Ms. Bishop's stories.  While not quite as good as the Black Jewels Trilogy, it is still well worth reading.	2001-10-14

At first I was somewhat disappointed that this was not another Vorkosigan book, but once I started reading, I could not put this down. While the action is not quite as non-stop as the Miles books, it still moves along at a good clip. <br />When we are first introduced to Cazaril, our hero, he is homeless and penniless, reduced to stealing clothes from a dead man. Formerly a great young warleader, he had been betrayed and sold as a galley slave. After being freed, he heads for the household where he once served as a page, hoping to beg for a position as a kitchen servant. Instead he is given the position as the secretary/advisor to the King's half-sister. He pledges to protect her, and when they are recalled to the corrupt capital city to attend to the dying king, his pledge is truly put to the test. Assailed by treachery and disaster on all sides, the royal family is under a terrible curse, and the gods want Cazaril to break it. And the only way to do that is for a man to die three times for the House of Chalion. <br />Cazaril is a fascinating character, full of dry wit and intelligence, and watching him careen from slave to secretary to reluctant saint makes for a very entertaining read. The secondary characters, from the slimey Lord Dondo to the strong-willed Royesse Iselle and her companion Lady Betriz are well-drawn and interesting as well.<br />Lots of action &amp; intrigue, fascinating characters, a well-drawn world, even a little romance--there is something in this book for everyone. You will not regret reading it!	2001-09-03

Moonlight is a tale of a much younger Tristan, a bumbling apprentice wizard for whom nothing ever seems to go right.  This Tale has many little touches which tie it in with the previous trilogy.  We see how he meets Thomas the cat, where he finds his silver Unicorn belt buckle, and even the origins of Minstrel.  We meet Blaise, his long-suffering wizard master.  We follow Tristan on an adventure spurred on by one mishap after another which ends in Tristan saving a Unicorn.  With the Unicorn's power, he could be the most powerful wizard in the world, but the Unicorn yearns for freedom.  Tristan has to make a heart-wrenching decision...

Read this book; you will not regret it!!  (And if you like the  characterization, give Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series a try)	1999-08-20

I am very sad to see her books are all out of print.  This one is full of her beautiful writing and images of the sea.  It's a sort of twist on the  selkie legends with a flavor all its own.  A young man sets out on a sea  journey of self discovery and finds his unknown father who lives IN the  sea... Fans of McKillip, McCaffrey, and McKinley will enjoy this author!	1999-04-24

Dragonflight is simply the best book I have ever read!  The world and it's people are so fully realized that it's hard to believe that Pern doesn't really exist.  When other girls had crushes on singers and movie stars, I  fell for F'lar!  I didn't want a horse--I wanted a gold  dragon!  All of  McCaffrey's books are spectacular, but this one will always hold a special  place in my heart. Read this book--you won't be sorry.	1999-01-23

This is the first book of Ms. Jones that I ever read, and it was so good that I have since searched out and read everything of hers that I could find!  A terrific tale with captivating characters!!   Beautiful, spoiled,  megalomaniacal young witch Gwendolyn believes she is destined to rule the  world, and her timid, good-hearted little brother Cat is swept along with  her plans and is left holding the bag when everything goes wrong!    Please  read this book, you won't be disappointed!   If you like this one, I also  highly recommend The Power of Three,  Howl's Moving Castle, and The  Magicians of Caprona!	1998-12-04

This fun and original story starts out the traditional way, with a quest--the wizard apprentice and a big brawny warrior set out to rescue an enchanted princess.  <br />The ultimate evil has created a prophecy saying the princess needs three things to be rescued--a wizard, the true heir to the throne, and the immortal, warhorse, Valadan. For hundreds of years, wizards and heirs have set out on this fruitless quest, dying and draining the land of Caladan of all its wise leaders.  <br />When his master is killed, young, bumbling apprentice, Tristan, sets out to fulfill the quest, and he acquires the one thing that the others discounted--the fabulous lost warhorse.  With Polassar, a conceited warrior of noble blood and Valadan, he sets out To rescue Allaire.  But the quest is just the beginning and neither the quest nor the characters turn out to be just what they seemed to be. I can't say much more without giving the twist away. <br />Oh, and one more thing for you animal lovers out there, Thomas, Tristan's familiar, is one of the most sarcastic cats you will ever come across.  If cats aren't your style, there is Minstrel the brave canary, and of course, there is immortal Valadan, sired by the wind itself, the magical mysterious and wise warhorse.<br />This is the start to one of those rare series where the books just get better and the final book, The Mountains of Channadran is one of my favorites.	1998-10-30
US	52713669	R1IBYWYJHFFYRR	0802761852	322614849	Outside	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Leaves a lasting impression...	I first read this young adult book when I was 7.  It was my first taste  of Science Fiction and 23 years later I still remember it!  It is set on a  world where everyone lives in a huge domed city which is full of broken  machines that no one remembers how to fix.  People live in gangs where  anyone in their twenties is considered an &quot;old&quot;. They suvive by  scavenging out of ancient stores.  Whole areas of the city are abandoned.  Food is running out, and the oxygen makers are breaking down.  And children  are following a mysterious rhyming man and vanishing.  The heroine of the  story is a young girl, a &quot;little&quot;,  who longs to see what is  outside the dome, even though &quot;olds&quot; say everything is dead.  So  she follows the rhyming man...<br />This story of a future Earth is a bit  scary for young readers,  but is very haunting and thought provoking for  more mature kids.  This story is one that many adults would do well to  read as well.  It may very well be our own future!!	1998-09-28

This was written in much the same vein as Bambi, so expect some sorrowful scenes as well as wonderful uplifting scenes.  Well worth the effort to find!  I still have my copy from 1981 if that tells you anything!!	1998-07-30
