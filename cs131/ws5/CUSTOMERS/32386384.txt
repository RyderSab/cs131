Includes 4 audio tapes  with 8 mysteries. <br />Narrators are Lorri Holt and Gina Leishman- 1st is American, second is English. Ms Leishman's English accent is ideal for the stories here by some of the United Kingdom's best mystery talent. <br /> <br />Stories are listed here: <br /> <br />1. Settled Score by Sara Paretsky - this one is also included on Skin Deep read by Kathleen Turner- I prefer the Turner reading for the grittier turn she gives to V.I Warshawski. <br /> <br />2. The Scar by Nancy Pickard  <br /> <br />3. Lucky Dip by Liza Cody- this is great! Has an English street urchin finding a huge treasure on a dead man and then having to scramble through the London streets to keep her bounty. <br /> <br />4. Full Circle by Sue Grafton- a Kinsey Milhone short story <br /> <br />5. Death & Diamonds by Susan Dunlap- done well here- this is a great short story. Also available in \\"Crime's Leading Ladies\\" and read by Sharon Gless. <br /> <br />6. Her Good Name by Carolyn Hart <br /> <br />7.

Sara Paretsky's take on Philip Marlowe is wonderfully done by reader Sharon Gless. Ms Gless does a great job with mystery fiction- she has read some other pieces by Paretsky and Sharyn McCrumb . One of the stories here- Death & Diamonds by Susan Dunlap is excellent- it is also included in another audio collection- but I prefer the reading here by Gless.<br /><br />If you like this be sure to check out Skin Deep by Sara Paretsky read by Kathleen Turner, and other Sharyn McCrumb mysteries read by Sharon Gless.	2005-07-14

Carl Hiaasen books get pretty raunchy at times and I was not sure I could listen to Ed Asner reading about hot and dirty action. I was pleased to find my misgivings to be unfounded. The consummate actor Mr. Asner brings Stormy Weather to life with a dry , sardonic wit that fits the material and allows the listener to get to know the characters and revel in their adventures and misadventures.  <br />The most colorful character in this ensemble piece- the crazy ex-governor turned swamp dweller Skink is particularily well drawn in Asner's reading. This is one of my favorite Hiaasen books and I am very happy I got an audio copy to listen to in the car!  <br />For those of you who are new to Hiaasen- the governor appears again in Sick Puppy.	2005-07-01

Scary medical thriller	I have been reading Tess Gerritsen since she started in the early 90s with Harlequin writing romance for the mystery line the Harlequin Intrigues. Harvest was a breakthrough novel for her into straight up medical suspense. The audio abridgement of Harvest is read skillfully by Jayne Brook. Great pacing, fast action, suspense, pathos, and genuine emotion are well acted in this reading. On 2 audiotapes it is just under 3 hours or so - it will leave you wanting more!Plays like a dynamite movie- makes you wonder why Hollywood has not turned this into a film.	2005-07-01

Very X-files in feel. I will be looking for more by this imaginative author. <br /> <br />Red as Blood is a signature Tanith Lee dark look at the Snow White fairytale. I love Tanith Lee- her horror and fantasy stories are always imaginative and full of twists. <br /> <br />Total time for tape is only 60 minutes. Good quality recording from Brilliance audio.	2005-07-01

His rich voice is well suited to this work. I am fond of abridgements of these kinds of books- the story gets distilled to a tight well controlled story without some of the authors wandering that the unabridged title may contain. Envy is a story within a story- a story of revenge for a long ago sin and one man's plot to get back at the man who took his life away. Along the way our tormented hero encounters things he does not expect- like love for the woman he sets out to use. The settings are well described and come to life with listening. From Florida's Key West to Manhattan and Connecticut in the northeast, and the rich outer island off Georgia- all settings take on as much character as the humans themselves.<br /><br />Set in the world of publishing the particular twists and turns of the story never get too technical- they flow with ease in this audio version. I liked the heroine and hero, was truly saddened by her loss and was happy with the end resolution which is wonderfully ironic and surprising.	2005-07-01

Great police procedurals with lots of drama- the romantic suspense is high on drama in both the romance and suspense departments. Joyce Bean is a capable reader who really holds the listeners attention keeping the stories moving along and holding the listeners interest. I like abridgments like this esp for the romantic suspense books- the author and editors work to bring the book down to its best elements so you get a concise hard hitting story that entertains fully. <br />Each book is 4 tapes- so 18 hours total of listening in one package- this is a great deal!	2005-05-19

Stories are read by Tom Wopat , William Atherton, David Strathairn and Henry Rollins. Included in the 6 disk collection which takes about 6 hours to read- or one trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles, or halfway from Fresno to Phoenix ( my two frequent long distance drives) are the following stories: <br />Blood Money read by Tom Wopat <br />Only Good Ones read by Henry Rollins <br />Trail of the Apache read by David Straithairn <br />Trouble at Rindo's Station read by William Atherton <br />The Boy Who Smiled read by Tom Wopat <br />The Tonto Woman read by William Atherton <br />Hurrah for Captain Early read by Tom Wopat ( this one is also in the When the Women Come out to Dance collection read by Taye Diggs - the two renditions are interesting to contrast as the hero in the story is an African-American who served in the all colored 10th Cavalry division) <br />The Colonel's Lady read by David Strathairn <br />Saint With a Six Gun read by Henry Rollins <br />You Never See Apaches read by William Atherton <br />Three-Ten to Yuma read by Henry Rollins <br /> <br />For those familiar with Leonard's westerns you will see his favorite landscape- the rugged land of southern Arizona and Apache territory. The scrub grass, dust and blistering heat are a character unto themselves. This collection is aptly handled by a talented crew. I particularily enjoyed the dry delivery of Atherton known best as the obnoxious reporter from the Die Hard movies. David Strathairn has a more measured approach to the complex tales of life on the frontier, Tom Wopat cowboys up for his tales and Henry ROllins is fantastic giving voice to the rough and tumble lawmen of 100 years ago. Recommended for fans of westerns and Leonard alike!	2005-04-23

Taye Diggs does and excellent job here of reading a broad selection of Elmore Leonard's short work. His delivery is wonderful! As a woman I have to admit I got kinds of caught up in the performance while on a long drive- was much more engrossing than other such readings I have listened to. I love the work of Leonard and it is well represented here- hard luck heroes, dumb criminals and women who are just questionable but irresistible to our heroes. From modern day law enforcers rousting white supremecists in the backwoods of the south, to a cowboy come home to his ranch in western Oklahoma , to rousting western tales and all kinds of wonderful colorful details that Leonard is known for. One of my favorite things is to read his early short stories that have been adapted to longer works- you get a glimpse into his mind as characters grow and change. Great job Taye ! I will be looking forward to more audio offerings with you.	2005-04-23

And only 30 years after Title 9	30 years or so since Title 9 the initiative supporting women's athletics in this country, and the efforts in the 70s to allow women full access into the military and Cindy Dees has written what will be seen as a landmark adventure / suspense novel with 6 top female officers/ athletes/uber-intelligent women being trained as special forces operatives for the military. Vanessa BLake is the main heroine and she rocks! MIT trained computer whiz is picked for a program that men in power is sure to fail- a pilot project where women are trained in special ops. We are talking CHuck Norris Delta Force/ Navy Seal stuff here- silent stalking, killing and gathering intelligence in complete anonymity in the far corners of the world with nothing but their wits to survive. The ladies deemed \\"Snake\\" ladies by themselves as members of the Medussa Project exceed all expectations and earn a place eventually in the intelligence world. This is fiction- and a few years in the future- but as a woman who grew up with the first women ever attending West Point in the 80s- I am thrilled to see such physical and intellectual prowess being achieved in a series of books like Bombshell. It was only a few years ago that women in the service were unusual. I love seeing Silhouette taking chances and publishing such a great book- CIndy Dees is one of the top writers working for the Bombshell line- her characters are rich and they aim high. Keep up the good work!  Great reading for Jr High and High School age girls- sex is treated with respect and the discipline , persistence and teamwork that the women use is a fantastic guideline for success .	2005-04-02

Paranormal with unusual twists	Sheri Whitefeather scores with this sexy  supernatural thriller set against the backdrop of LA. Includes black magic, otherworldly happenings, spells, evil witches, good forces and a super sexy heroine who is a psychic and dresses like a dominatrix, and an appealing hero described as the \\"Indian FBI\\"- reminded me of Val Kilmer in Thunderheart. Great supporting characters - arty sister, tough cop friends, rogue Native American activist , weird Hollywood producer- and a strong base mythology ( evil doings dating back a century are at work) are laid out in this first book in at least a pair if not a series to follow. Native American folklore and witchcraft beliefs provide the eerie gothic tones the permeate this serial murder mystery and set the author's first full length novel off to a great start. Ms. Whitefeather has been successfully writing for the SIlhouette Desire line for some time- I am thrilled to get the chance to read a longer book by her with equal intensity in the lovemaking and attraction between her leads and fantastic handling of Native American themes. The Apache/ Sioux and Creek elements are blended nicely making a great read! I love the BOmbshell line- my only complaint is some of the books are extra light on the sex and romance- this is not one of them! Super romance - steamy sex that would work in a BLAZE novel- and fun supernatural storyline. 4 stars and I can't wait for more!	2005-04-02

I love the thai spring rolls and other exotic dishes here. Many ethic foods with lots of exotic spices - you really work on tasting new things and trying new foods with this cookbook. I usually plan menus using a couple of recipes from here and mixing them with some of my own low-carb dishs gleaned from Atkins or South Beach type plans.  <br />Am back in diet zone this spring and am pulling out this trusty favorite for healthy eating ideas.  <br />My favorite cookbooks mix imaginative dishes with ones that just plain taste good- and this one meets those criteria if you are dieting or just keeping your fats down to keep from dieting!	2005-03-29

Cindy Dees tells a tightly woven , well crafted action packed thriller that goes beyond the romance genre. Written in the style of a James Bond espionage story , mixed with romantic suspense our story begins with Amanda McClintock sneaking into her friend Marina's dressing room at Carnegie Hall and having a retired Russian agent take a cyanide pill rather than tell Amanda what he is hiding!Taylor Roberts is a clinical psychologist assigned more to watch out for Amanda than really take part in her case tracking down illegal diamond smuggling for arms. They travel all over the world from one exotic locale to another, dodging bad guys and bullets. Taylor learns how to be an agent and Amanda learns how to put her cold exterior aside and reveal the human being within. They fall in love and support each other while unravelling a complex mystery of high intrigue.  <br />I really like this book- what the other BOmbshells have missed is the intensity of the relationship and the strong character and relationship development that Cindy Dees excels at with this book. I really cared about both characters and found myself thoroughly engaged from start to end.  <br />The entity they work for Deveraux has been described as a group of good guys looking for vigilante justice with many agents working around the globe- I hope a series is to follow!	2005-01-07

The aboriginal mysticism in Australia is nicely balanced by people shooting bazookas at our heroes in a helicopter! <br /> <br />I only have one complaint and I think this is a generational thing with the author- her dialog when she tries to use colloquialisms feels stiff and unnatural. Very few women or men- even gung ho military types use \\"dude\\" as much as she uses it. This is a term that went out with valley girls 20 years ago. \\"Buddy\\", \\"guy\\" or even \\"hey you\\" would be more current. This is a quirk I have seen in a number of books by the author- just a little thing- but it does disrupt things. Editors- please take note and get out a thesaurus.	2004-12-16

This vampire romance is set in the seedy and glamorous New York club scene. Velvet ropes and drugged out zombies, vampires flying from rooftops to big time shootouts- this is an outstanding novel. Well written, strong character development. Our hero is a real man's man cop- right out of Law and Order. He falls for the beautiful tormented vampire who works to right wrongs herself.  <br />Erica Orloff is a major talent- I expect her books to be right up there with others who have broken out of romance for broad commercial success in 5 years. Read THE ROOFER- her violent diary of life as an Irish crime family princess and you will be hooked as I am!	2004-12-16

Written in 1st person we get to know Angel Baker very well.  <br />My issue is a bit of a broken record here and apologize- but 1st person is limiting as a novel type. We get to know Angel really well- but in a ROMANTIC novel I like seeing things from a 3rd person narrative view.  <br />I knew very little about our hero by the end and had a tough time understanding how they were supposed to be a couple.  <br />I knew all about Angel and her dysfunctional life with her mom, her foster parents and siblings and her Kung Fu master, even with her robotic boyfriend but the motivation and depth of character of the hero were not there. He is peripheral to the story. <br />The reason that the Janet Evanovich and JD Robb books that this series seeks to evoke work- are that they are well written narratives that let us get to know the characters by action and deed as well as dialog and introspection. Having occasional chapters focused on someone else rounds out a good romance. Having insight into how others view the world of the novel builds depth you do not get in a purely 1st person novel. I love Bridget Jones Diaries- but the content and humor elevate the material beyond the architecture of the book. Julie Beard does not achieve this here. <br />	2004-12-16

I was introduced to her by Urban Legend in the SIlhouette Bombshell series and picked this up because I liked her writing. The Roofer is a dark and dangerous story of a woman and her brother and how their father a brutal man - a leader of one of the Irish gangs in Hells Kitchen in New York lived and died. This is a not often glimpse into the unglamorous lifestyle of those whose life is crime. <br />Ava and Tom O'Neill struggle through youth as their father is in and out of prison for his works, raised at times by his brother, and dad's gangster colleagues after the children's mother takes her own life early on as a result of a long battle with manic depression. <br />A journalist sets out to uncover THE ROOFER- that is the street name for their father. He throws men off roofs as a method of making a statement and ruling the are with terror. THe result is not what the journalist expects- the public is fascinated with the Irish Sopranos and a big movie is made about Ava's father. The journey through fame and fortune, the dark secrets never revealed, battles with sanity, sobriety , conscience and guilty have a distinctly Catholic flavor captured beautifully in these pages.  <br />The Roofer would make one heck of a good movie! A nice complement to all of the glamorized Italian princess films. Ava is a dark, tortured, tormented, damaged heroine who longs for nothing. Her hope has long been taken away. Seeing her reach for a different life and moving out of darkness is just great.	2004-12-02

This is a novel of grit and depth. The frank sexuality and situations depicted do not leave much the imagination- they are supposed to shock and even repulse. <br />Ryan Kinsmore is a handsome young yuppie from initial appearances and his new neighbor Sara Diamond is impressed by his gentle nature, big heart and warmth. She is shocked when she finds out he was a teenage runaway who ended up a male escort- something he stil is 10 years later. Ryan as \\"Kevin\\" is a highly paid prostitute and even though he loves Sara he feels unworthy of her love and has little true self-value. His madam Katherine saved him from the streets and groomed him into the suave man he presents to the world but on the inside he sees himself as a scared  kid who did anything for money. <br />This book is very much a book of discovery and finding the courage to make a big change as it is a romance. I found Ryan to be an empathetic character and believable. Most stories with prostitutes are women- few are men, yet more and more men work as sex workers today servicing men and women ( watch Law and Order SVU any episode to verify this) and the whole objectification of the service provider and the way they see themselves was done well here. Sara is an interesting woman- she is a writer who is in the midst of her own career turmoil so these two meeting at a critical crossroads is no accident.  <br />The love making between Ryan and Sara is sweet once it happens- the emotions and trust issues rule their heads and hearts and bodies.  <br />This is an adult story with very adult themes- not for the faint of heart. Story is set in San Francisco and there is a secondary subplot involving Sara facing that someone close to her is gay and her having to accept this. Again- if you are offended- read something else. If you are open to what is in a person's heart and body- this is a great read with many unexpected touchesof humor as well as driving pathos as Ryan finds a way out of the life he has lived for so long.	2004-10-18

From Rhodesia to Kenya and such we see many different stories and perspectives. We meet colonial Boers, English farmers, native legends, native peoples, miners, scholars, women, children, men, hunters, animals- just about everything! <br />Her stories begin in the early part of the 1900s and as they progress into the 1950s and 1960s the political tone changes with the times without being a political narrative. The focus is on people and storytelling. It is no wonder Doris Lessing is known as one of the best writers in English fiction- this book is amazing! <br />	2004-10-11

Truly one of America's most talented writers- her work deserves notice and study. Her writing style has a lyrical quality, it flows and builds. I find it impossible to put her books down- the quality of the writing, the interesting characters and the intensity of her storytelling is irresistible. <br /> <br />The Keepers of the House is a must for anyone who considers themselves a true bibliophile!	2004-10-11

Told in her signature style of first person narrative from various perspectives through the book. Opening is the pleasure seeking life of the patriarch Edward who seeks out every pleasure of the flesh and buys people like trinkets and toys. He goes through women and a few men for physcial pleasure and companionship , marries repeatedly and hires a poor Irish woman in good health - a stranger to sire his son.  <br />Book2 is the story of his son Stephen a scholar who disdains the flesh and devotes his life to his ministry and studies. He marries a woman who has given up pleasure for duty and they have 2 sons. <br />Book3 focuses on Lucy- wife of Stephen. Her story is quite interesting. She is of English and Boer descent from Kenya. She ends up in the US via a short intense marriage to a brilliant man Stephen went to school with at Princeton. HEr marriage and the intellectual power and dissembly of her husband's mental state is portrayed with a stark prose that is Ms Grau at her best.  <br /> <br />Shirley Ann Grau won the Pulitzer in 1965 for Keepers of the House. Her other works include the Condor Passes and a number of collections of short stories. Her strength is her character development. Evidence of Love is a character study. A quick read- a must for devotees of her work. <br />	2004-10-11
US	32386384	RVODRVO53NLCD	0394472497	673442442	The Condor Passes	Books	4	30	31	N	N	Excellent family saga	The Condor Passes is a fascinating family saga that takes the reader from the late 1800s into the 1960s. <br />Told in signature Grau style we get several different stories in 1. We get the story of The Old Man. He is the gangster and bootlegger who started out dirt poor on the banks of the Ohio River and left home for adventure and fortune. He settles in New Orleans and builds an empire. <br />He has 2 daughters- one the perfect debutante, one a hell-raiser. <br />He marries his eldest daughter the man of his choice- a man in his image- a poor Cajun he has mentored in his business to suceed him.  <br />Looking over everyone and caring for the Old Man is his black butler who sees all and makes sure things go the way the Old Man wants. Seeing and listening and never getting in the way. <br />From the beginning to the end this story of the 20th century is fascinating. Far better written than the other sagas of the time yet every bit as compelling as the Harold Robbins and Taylor Caldwell potboilers that were so popular in the 60s and 70s. <br />The Condor Passes is great entertainment- not one to be missed!	2004-10-11

I liked the fact that the heroine was  a plus sized woman with a professional career.  <br />Boy was I disappointed.... another whining long story where a woman has to go through hell and end up thin in order to find happiness.  <br />This is advertised as a comedy- NO WAY! There is graphic disturbing violence toward the end . The heroine is pushed to the ground while very pregnant and forced into horrific labor which leaves her uterus torn and then removed and her baby in terrible distress. Comedy? If I want angst I will read something that is better written. <br />	2004-10-11

The heroine Nancy Barton is an Admiral's duaghter who does her war effort by working in the Pentagon. She meets dashing officers and gentlemen both in the US Navy and handsome allied officers.  <br />Exciting, romantic- this reads like a wonderful 40s black and white movie. <br />Fun historical novel!	2004-10-09
US	32386384	R14G4TOAJ0LPT9	0446365378	533049768	Love Bite	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Dark paranormal romance meets hard boiled detective novel	This book to me is a melding of two of my favorite genres- the hardboiled detective meeting the mysterious hungry vampire who only feeds on the unsavory ones who society disdains. The hero reminds me of Michael Connely's tormented Harry Bosch. <br />The ending is satisfying and has a ring of moral redemption while at the same time plunging our hero into the vampiress' darkness. Few romance type books have the female as the vampire- this mystery does a great job of moving the story along and building a tale with compelling and interesting characters. WOuld love to read more like this- how about a sequel?	2004-10-08

The author details the history of the region from a social, political and economic level from the founding time of the Puritans to today.  <br />Included is history of the fishing industry out of Gloucester, the shipbuiling in Essex adn the granite quarries of Rockport. It was from Cape Ann that the first wagons headed west and the American warship's were launched. <br />A must for afficianados of New England history.	2004-10-08

THe worst of the 5- Lucifer killed Seraphim's family leaving her for dead.  <br />Along the way she is forced to do battle with real evil, accept the help of a mysterious mercenary, put aside her hatred and prejudices to conquer evil.  <br />Solid broad fantasy themes, good action and an intersting heroine and decidedly different hero who embraces her as a partner and equal.  <br />I am a firm believer that the solid themes in all of the Luna books of equality, strength and moral fortitude make for great reading. I highly recommend this line particularily for younger readers.	2004-10-01

This is a cute light romantic comedy with a lady cop as the lead. Check out her other early titles as well! The Harlequin Intrique Code Name: Love is one of her first romantic suspense efforts and a must for her fans!	2004-09-29
US	32386384	R323DWL7W5D6AY	037380203X	446090942	The Charmed Sphere (Misted Cliffs, Book 1)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	REcommended esp for younger readers	This fantasy tale with magical spheres of light and power , a wicked warlord, a twisted mage, an enchanted prince and two mystical women is lyrical and filled with interesting locations, acts of heroism and strength of heart and courage.  <br />LUNA is the new Fantasy label from Harlequin. Their books are targeted at women. I read the original Charmed Destinies anthology that the Mage Worlds premiered in and really enjoyed it. <br />I think that this line is particularly good reading for younger audiences- the general themes presented in a fresh tone make great self-esteem building reading for young girls. There is nothing too heavy in the sexuality in this book- totally ok for girls in junior high and a nice companion to reading Tolkein. <br />	2004-09-28

I enjoyed this book immensely- recently re-released it is great. <br>Part 1 MOONLIGHT by Forster is sexy and wild- a dark werewolf tale- the young maiden gives her innocence to save her love. Highly erotic and dark.<br>Part 2 MADNESS by Rupprecht is striking- the violent taking of the gentle physician turned vampire of his blind lover is brutal and highlights the consequences of the curse dramatically.<br>Part 3  MAGIC is a modern tale by Charlotte Hughes. The boy is suffering from horrible pain- his fears and revulsions and nightmares become real - reads more like a Stephen King book or an episode of the X-files. How the gentle witch breaks the curse and finds love with her Nightingale is strong and true.	2004-06-30

Much like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum - Olivia has things that just seem to roll along and happen taking her with them. She pursues a rich Arab playboy she is sure is al queda all over the world and is told by one and all she is crazy- until guess who foils the bad guys and saves the day? <br>I liked the book, found Olivia a likeable leading lady with a fun perspective on life - and hunky bell boys.<br>Her go to it- spunk and verve carry her through and you really want her to be respected for her intelligence and gumption. When she is - it is satisfying. Left me with a smile and a desire to read more adventures with Oliva Joules- grown up girl guide and spy- with a freshly minted license to kill but no desire to hurt anyone.	2004-06-30
US	32386384	R2V4XR4RHUPYXP	0263178978	867300166	City Girl in Training	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Enjoyable but is first person	I agree whole heartedly with the previous review regarding the first person issues. My biggest complaint with the whole chick lit genre is the reliance on this trite and limiting writing style. At least Liz Fielding offers up comic scenes with flair and never falters on her voice and view- this is a well written 1st person novel. I liked the Philly meets the hunk next door and thinks he is gay so he is safe thing.... she is sweet and nice but the 1st person limits the depth we usually expect from a Liz Fielding romance. Read it enjoy it but don't expect tooo much.	2004-06-22

From the moment their eyes meet the chemistry is powerful. Kidnapping aside- he treats her with respect and is very honorable - she is the one who has to jump him to consummate their feelings!<br />Liz Fielding knows how to bring on the heat without explicit romance-I would love to see her tackle a fuller romance with the heat - she has the emotions down so well. I enjoyed this book and am working on getting through all of her books. The English characters are not overly English- they are highly relatable to this American woman. I especially like the variety of families that Liz Fielding's characters come from- Rose has a mother who is renowned feminist who used her dad for a sperm donor and little else. Her brother is an amiable veterinarian living in this desert country and making his own way while she has been touring the globe as a journalist. Rose took thehigh risk job after her much older husband died- and broke her heart. The theme of learning to love and live is universal and well done in this exotic location with 2 very different people.	2004-06-16
