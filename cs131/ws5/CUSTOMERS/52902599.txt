"Tokyo.." is much much better	I read this after I read \\"Tokyo doesn't love us anymore\\" and realized how much better RL has gotten as a writer.<br /><br />TDLUA is a great read.  Check it out.	2005-02-27

This without a doubt ranks up there with the WORST books I have ever read.  Pointless, poorly written, and incredibly dull.<br /><br />If you want some great writing, try Ayn Rand.	2005-01-12

This book started with an interesting premise, but ran out of gas at the end with no clear resolution - or better yet no satisfying resolution.  It's more love story that mystery.<br /><br />Very well written however.	2004-12-13

While the DaVinci code is a great story, the writing is very Grisham-like and reads like 10th grade level novel.  Come on.<br /><br />The Rule of Four is extremely well written compare to 'Code', and the story is good to boot.<br /><br />Go back to Grisham folks.	2004-11-02

With the Dirk Pitt books starting to get a little repetitive, I really enjoy these books co-written with Craig Dirgo.  The plots are interesting, there's no unnecessary romance, and the characters are various but fun.  In addition, there is a legend in the front of the book if you forget who's who.<br /><br />I hope this series continues for a while.	2004-10-26

I believe we all make choices every day on how we want to live.  I am not saying it is not a condition, but it is still a conscious choice.  We all wake up everyday and choice what we want to be.  Some people choose a job and a stable life, and some choose drugs and alcohol.<br />That being, said, I really like this book.  The writing is unique and interesting and really drives the point home.<br />An overall great read.	2004-07-15

Once you get past the premise that 3 brothers would go into the Honduran jungle having NO experience in jungle travel, NO idea where they were really going, and NO idea what exactly they were looking for, the book reads quickly and is pretty decent.	2004-02-05

While this book is obviously well written, to me its a long ride to nowhere.  Not much actually happens in the book, and the senseless ramblings between the King and Henderson are all rehashes of the same old 'meaning of life' sayings.<br />The book was a bit of a chore to get through, with little payoff at the end.	2004-01-27

For those of you ripping Cussler for this book, be aware that HE DID NOT WRITE IT.  Cussler is the 'Creative Director' for these books, which means he provides the basic story and outline, and then Graig Dirgo actually writes the book.<br />I think this is actually the best of the books Dirgo has co-authored.<br />And for all you whiners out there, Trojan Odyssey will be Cussler's last Dirk Pitt novel, so these books be all that's left after that.	2003-11-13

Aaron McGruder uses one of America's last great loophole, being African-American, to produce some ridiculously funny stuff.  Few white authors in America (sans Andy Rooney) could get away with any if this, but the fact the McGruder is black gets him a  free pass.  I really don't care, because its good stuff.	2003-06-27

I found the story to be a bit jagged with little chance of actually figuring out who the killer is until the very end.<br />However, it did introduce me to some of Dante's, as well as Longfellow's prose, so it was worth it.	2003-05-12

US	52902599	R38ZT2WEV3GPC	0452011876	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	4	2	6	N	N	The greatest American Novel...	It's funny when you read a talented writer like Rand, and look at all the drivel (Grisham, etc.) that is published today, and realize that there are not many great writers in the world now.  Sure, all the pulp fiction are great STORIES, but the writing still comes off as a high school senior's creative writing project.<br />Even if you didn't like the story, no one(of any intelligence) can say the writing is not top notch.<br />While this is one of my fav books of all time, there are two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: 1) J. Galt's speech is simply too long. 2) I didn't like the senseless killing of the guards at the end of the book.<br />Aside from that, a terrific read.	2000-12-27
