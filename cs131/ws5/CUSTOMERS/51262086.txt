Here, there are a few pages of cast bio in the front, and about 20 pages of information of how the movie was made at the back (well, a paragraph or two of information per page, and lots of photos).  In between is the 'real' history of the attack on Pearl Harbor...but it is illustrated by scenes from the movie - which really bore little relationship to the actual events and to use them to illustrate those events is horrible!  At the very least, a photo of the real General Doolittle should have been put beside that of Alec Baldwin (who portrayed him) a photo of the real Genda beside that of Tagawa, who portrayed him), etc. This book succeeds neither as a history of Pearl Harbor, nor as a Making of the Movie.	2005-07-20

Books	1	1	2	N	N	Lousy book	This book rates no stars, really - it is really a lousy book. As the reviewer above stated - 12 kings and queens of Egypt are picked out of the air, with no rhyme or reason as to why they were chosen above others. And then this is combined with the 'classical deitites' of Greece and Rome which makes no sense whatever.  Are Egyptians supposed to have worshiped these gods?  No. Then why include them?  A ridiculous book.	2005-03-06

The White Bird was a plane that has never been found, yet Cussler writes authoritatively on exactly how the two men died, from one man getting the top of his head cut off to the other having his back broken and sinking beneath the waves.  <br />Second is the Marie Celeste, where he has the crew get into a boat to escape what they believe to be a sinking ship, how they become separated from the ship, and a chronology of how each one of the crew dies. <br />Now, reading his attempts to discover the wrecks is interesting, but I wish he'd not tried the fiction parts of it which really do invalidate this book as a serious source.	2003-02-19

It comes as a shock and a disappointment to read that they stay in abusive relationships for more than a day.  Yet such is the case with Heidi Howkins, who stayed in an abusive relationship with her husband Zee for way too long (even when he'd once tried to kill her she stayed with him because he threatened to take her daughter away to Syria).  <br />She tells that story and more in K2: A Quest For The Summit.  Eventually she frees herself from Zee, she rises above the obstacles placed in her way from other climbers in this male-dominated world.  She's a good writer and tells the story well.<br />It's not a story of one climb but of several, it's a series of memoirs, really.  Why does Howkins use the hitchiker 'Hiddle' as a foil - someone to tell her stories to?  Other reviewers of this book have dismissed him as a fictional character, (and a bad device at that) - yet nowhere in the book does Howkins say that he is...so why do they assume so?  Because it's impossible to believe a man could sit in a car with a woman and listen to HER talk?  Pay attention to HER talk?  If Hiddle the hitch-hiker is a fiction, why did Howkins think it necessary to use this foil?  Well, their conversations do illuminate her stories the more...for example in the beginning with his talk of 'Ananku' or trouble.  She is capable of learning from her adventures, long after they have passed.<br />''Go ahead, I'm listening.'' she has Hiddle say.  One wonders if in the real world she ever had a man who said that to her, and meant it.	2002-10-26

He follows the current fad of seeing everything from a gay subtextual standpoint, which annoyed me.  (Characters such as Batman  and the Lone Ranger needed a Robin and a Tonto to talk to, both so that  they could be 'telling the audience' what they are telling their sidekicks,  and in Robin's case, to appeal to the youngsters (since Batman actually was  an adult type comic book, much as comics are today).  Anyway, Nachman gets  in his little snide comments (for example - The Lone Ranger, sole survivor  of an ambush, probably shot up pretty bad, is rescued by the Indian Tonto.   As the two characters are talking, introducing themselves to each other,  Nachman writes that the Lone Ranger is 'nestled' in the arms of Tonto.   There are other comments like this.  Gay subtext is fine, but I don't think  it works for the radio programs of the 30s-50s.  More a comment on the fact  that women and girls weren't allowed to have any fun!  In any event,  Nachman's comments in this subtextual vein are more snidely than  objectively written.         So, I didn't like the author's style of  writing, and then of course there are the errors.  Quite a few.  Don't know  nuthin' bout Adlai Stevenson, but I do know about The Shadow and The Saint,  The Green Hornet, Sherlock Holmes, etc. etc.  For a full list of errors, or  to contribute some that you found, see the Cave Canem which is  located at The Dagger of the Mind ezine site.	1999-09-29

The previous reviewer of this book said:   Chan/Moto movies....''all with bad foreign accents, and goof-ball social ettiquette, spouting out fortune cookie wisdom and acting in some subservient role to another stronger,  non-Asian character.&quot; Clearly she's never seen the movies. Though Moto  and Chan were not played by Asian actors, true,  the Asian characters they  played NEVER were 'subservient' to non-Asian characters. Their  police/secret service colleagues - on their level, always treated them with  respect.  Lesser policement displayed prejudices - but they were used for  comic relief and were always shown up.   Chan was always unfailingly polite  - which made the ill-mannered non-Asians around him seem like the boors  they were, and Moto of course beat up on everybody who deserved it.  There  is nothing denigrating in the Chan/Moto movies for any Asian/Asian-American  who is not obsessed with political correctness.

It is similar to Agatha Christie's 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas' - only Heyer wrote her version about 5 years earlier.  An old man is the tyrant of his household.  When he is murdered, everything comes apart.  Georgette Heyer conveys the emotions of dispair and hopelessness and regret much better than Christie does in her version.  The murderer thought things would be better, they're not, but the old man can't be brought back to life again.

It was actually written much earlier than the rest of them, and before her more famous Asey Mayo became a success.

The other old standbys (Haseltine, the Octopus of Fate, Cannae) do not make their appearance.  Therefore it's not my favorite book in the series, but it is an excellent introduction.<br />  It's the middle of winter, and Witherall is working as a janitor in a bookstore, his pension from the boys' academy where he taught having disappeared during the stock market crash.  A young man, out on bail after being framed for a crime he didn't commit, wearing only a thin suit and carrying a bag of golf-clubs (Taylor originated the MacGuffin long before Hitchcock!) enters the shop to evade a cop who's intent on returning him to jail.  Within a few minutes, one of the people in the shop is bashed on the back of the head and killed.  Coincidentally (yes, coincidences abound in the Witherall books) it's the same person who framed our young hero.<br />  Witherall, confident in his ability to solve the crime, takes the young female owner of the shop and the young man in tow, and proceeds to deal with gangsters, oafish policemen, and fiendish professors of anthropology in short order.	1998-01-27

After attending the board meeting of Haymaker's Department Store, Witherall goes to the 'lost and found' in order to get an umbrella to cope with the sudden rain storm outside.  He enters the room, is 'biffed', and wakes up in a wicker hamper used to carry French bread, in a horse drawn cart making deliveries around the Dalton Hills area.  He grabs a loaf of French bread as he exits the hamper, and arrives home, intent on making a complaint about the treatment of new members of the board of directors, but can't articulate it via letter, so decides to visit Haymaker's home.  Of course, Haymaker is there, murdered.  <br /> Complicating matters is that Haymaker has been stabbed to death with the Samurai sword that 'Pink' (the lady of the case) had left out on her porch to be collected for sale at the Victory Swop Meet that night.  And Pink, unfortunately, had jilted Haymaker twenty years before and gotten on the bad side of the local police department.  <br /> Witherall and Pink unite to solve the crime of Haymaker's murder, dealing with the insidious coils that bring an oil lady who drives around in a mink coat, a young man who resents that he's been declared 4F, and the Air Raid Warden leader who is intent on tracking down Witherall for his report.	1998-01-27
