It seems like a good one.  Since the author<br />uses SPECT scans.  SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography)<br />makes a lifelike version of the brain.  Unfortunately, the author adds some cognitive<br />therapy and meditation to his program.  He changes the names of the exercises<br />(thereby cutting out Beck, Burns, Ellis, and the Buddha).  But this is what you must remember if you buy this book: He never does a follow-up SPECT scan after one<br />uses just cognitive therapy or meditation.  Just drugs.  This makes the whole book invalid.  Chapters 14 and 15 are good on alcohol and pollutant use.	2002-11-18

In fact, it is pretty<br />good.  But what if you could examine another world-class system?  Now, I don't mean herbology or whatever.  I mean a whole world-class system of healing that<br />includes meditation, nutrition, astrology, medicines, surgery; the whole bit.  Like<br />examining another world!  Well, Tibet was isolated from us all and had to create<br />their own medical system.  And I think that you should know it.  Now I don't have cancer or AIDS like you may have.  But I have had liver pains for 25 years.  I went<br />to an internist and he could find nothing wrong.  For my body-type (fire), stress<br />can cause liver pains in Tibetan Medicine.  This relieved me so much.  Because it<br />was true.  I just had not realized it before.  My liver pains happen when I'm stressed!<br />So I don't worry about it anymore.  This book is not a replacement for conventional<br />medicine.  And it may not help you at all.  But it will give you a wider perspective of your body.  In Tibetan Medicine, the very best thing that you can do for your health<br />is to avoid the ten negative actions (Please buy and read Yeshe Dhondon's \\"Healing<br />From the Source.\\")  Then you need to find out your constitutional body-type.  There<br />are seven body types.  Basically, a mesomorph is a fire type.  And the best diet is<br />vegetarian.  I have a little ectomorph (actually, a lot) mixed in with the mesomorph,<br />so I am lucky enough to be able to eat eggs, fish, and poultry.  It's all a question of balance.  From there we go into all sorts of things; enemas, herbs, meditation, astrology.  But we start with behavior and nutrition.  Oddly enough, the Tibetans<br />did not put a great stress on exercise.  Perhaps they walked a lot.  Your guess is<br />as good as mine.  Please buy this book.  Just look into another world.  I do think that<br />it will help you no matter what.  And I hope that you are blessed with happiness.	2002-11-13

Way back.  Planting a seed deep down.<br />In good soil.  And allowing it to become something great.  The satisfaction here<br />is not to become rich or even to be successful.  It is knowing that you have<br />really created something of great use to humanity.  So you water the seed.  It grows.<br />There are setbacks.  There are lightening storms.  But the plant still grows.  This<br />is the great business that you have created.  You care for it like a mother does for a child.  This is the only book on business that I've seen which exemplifies<br />what this country was originally all about.  To do something worthwhile in business.<br />To do something great in life.  One may become rich from the seed.  Or famous.<br />But the point is &quot;meaning.&quot;  If you want to be a REAL businessman (and I do),<br />please buy this book.

Yogananda made<br />the fatal error of believing that there was only one religion or truth.  And that he,<br />himself, could discern it in all religions.  He did that with the Bible.  He does<br />this here with a Sufi poem.  But this is a fine book.  Very beautiful.  But Yogananda's<br />Self-Realization Fellowship was and is Hinduism straight up the middle.  Not<br />Original Christianity and Original Yoga as he claimed.  So this book is an Islamic<br />poem as interpreted by a Hindu.  And I think that you had better realize that<br />before you buy this book.  And it is a beautiful book.  Yogananda was always a<br />great writer.  Most of his books are real &quot;choppy&quot; because they are taken from talks.<br />But when he wrote, it was excellent.  He was quite a writer.  And it comes out<br />in this book.

There is a chapter devoted to an update on increasing the strength.<br />of Optimism.  That chapter is worth the book alone.  Finding out our five signature strengths is the core of the book.  This can account for tremendous dissatisfaction.<br />in our jobs and marriages.  This is a bold and frightening book.

I once saw the author speak.  He is incredible.  He emanates love.  And this<br />book is something that you should own.  He describes the eight thought trainings<br />and the thirty-seven Bodhisattva Practices.  I so much wanted him to be my teacher.  But he moved from Los Angeles to Long Beach.  He is a true gentleman and a man of great character.  The first 24 pages of this book discusses the preliminaries to practice.  The inference is that you will need a teacher.  But even if you don't, hearing<br />the words of this Spiritual Master can be good.  Thinking about them.  And maybe<br />meditating on them.  For there is \\"lama-flypaper.\\"  That means that if you practice what is stated here, you can attract a lama of some kind.  Perhaps a teacher.<br />Maybe more books for the time being.  Then maybe friends of a lama.  Yes.  It can<br />happen to you if you behave yourself.  On page 88, Geshe-la talks about four<br />qualities of a true spiritual practitioner.  I just love this part because  I don't have one!  Buy this book and read it.  This is a lovely man.<br />And he speaks the dharma with great clarity and simplicity.

Here we may be in for some disappointments.  The author won't say it.  But she really hypothesizes that you<br />can't have (this is hard to grasp) a user-friendly house or dwelling unless you have<br />a minimum of some time-management or organizational skills.  Now she doesn't<br />write separate books on time-management or organization, but she does give the<br />bare minimum of these skills.  That includes calendars and \\"to-do\\" lists.  She does<br />say that you can go right to the other sections to learn.  But the implications are<br />what I just stated.

Section 6 is \\"The Part of Tens.\\"  Basically everything<br />that we didn't cover in the previous five sections.

The book has everything you need.  But let us get to the point.  In chapter four, you will be asked to assess a strategy.  There are two approaches and about 1,000 variations in between.  The first is<br />the &quot;Overnight Approach&quot;.  And we all know what that is.  Then<br />there is the &quot;Gradual Approach&quot;.  You plan a stategy based on the advantages and disadvantages that she outlines.  I thought that the &quot;Overnight Approach&quot; was bad for your health or dangerous.  I know that Rudoloph Ballantine says so in &quot;Transition to Vegetarianism.&quot;  And I believe that other books have said so.  But she says that it's okay.  It's basically how fast you want to go.  Now we go to chapter 10 where the real changes are made.  You will have to throw a lot of stuff out of your kitchen. You will have to streamline your equipment.  Buy staples (foods without meat).  There is a terrific checklist of what to buy at the store.  The other chapters are mainly on the problems that you will encounter.  Entertaining, vitamins, traveling.  I could be a vegetarian tonight!  I just wouldn't be very happy because I haven't prepared.  I have tried my best to help you make a decision on buying this book.  Thank you.	2002-08-20

Sri Daya Mata is the president of Self-Realization Fellowship.<br />Many people feel that she is a saint.  And after you read this book, I don't think that you will have any doubts that this is true.  I believe that she has glued herself so close to the teachings of her guru, Paramahansa Yogananda, that there is no<br />difference between her and the teachings.  As one devotee has said, &quot;She is love.&quot;  This book is like a diamond.  You will<br />see different facets of love for God as you turn each page.  This is also a guide for loving God in modern life.  How you can keep that love alive away from your meditation seat.  I personally don't believe in God.  I am ruled by the intellect<br />and I envy Sri Daya Mata very much.  She is in touch with an existental being that cannot be defined by the intellect in words.  Tibetan Buddhists say that Hindu-yoga is dangerous because it simply allows high concentration states which produce<br />bliss.  But not wisdom-realizing emptiness.  Please turn to page<br />558 of &quot;God Talks to Arjuna&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda.  Chapter 5<br />Verse 18.  &quot;A sleeping man, beholding a dream drama, may cry out:<br />'There's a low pariah!  And there's my friend the priest!  How<br />noisy it is here--dogs barking, cows lowing, and elephants trumpeting!' Yet, on awakening, he realizes (if he remembers the dream) that the various 'living' creatures possessed no inherent differences, all being unreal mind-spinnings.&quot;  In this explanation of a verse, Yogananda makes in clear that a hindu-yogi does reach wisdom-realizing emptiness.  That is, all things are merely what we impute on them.  A &quot;dog.&quot;  A &quot;cat.&quot;  All unreal but at the same time real.  In this book, Daya Mata exemplifys this position.  She is not a &quot;love-junkie.&quot;  She is<br />not a &quot;samadhi-junkie.&quot;  She is in contact with an existential<br />force which proves itself by it's own existence.  There is only one problem with this book.  You may read it and get gooey-eyed<br />over &quot;GOD.&quot;  Go further.  Sri Daya Mata asks you to put yourself to the test.  Can you love God in modern day life?  All the time?<br />Personally, I cannot.  Can you?may read it and get gooey-eyed<BR>over &quot;GOD.&quot;  Go further.

They have it down to a \\"mind-science.\\"  Only a fool would not study this book if he had the opportunity.  Because we can bank on one thing.  Death is getting closer to us by the very second. It's a frightening and horrible thought, I know.  But still it remains...  And when I finish this review, I will be closer to death.  So what do we do?  ...  If we are evil, we can think pragmatically about cheating God.  The Tibetans believe in \\"powa\\", a technique of transferring one's conciousness into a pure land.  A pure land is like heaven.  Once there, we can choose our rebirth.  We can choose our parents.  Our family.  Our place of human rebirth.  If<br />we want a human rebirth.  So there are an infinite number of possiblities once we reach a pure land.  Geshe Kelsang Gyatso<br />gives us instructions on how to do this. \\"Powa\\" is \\"transference<br />of counciousness.\\" And most of you badly need this book!  I badly need this book!  I have this book.  Buy this book!  The<br />last half teaches us in the training of virtue.  It is assumed that we want to make our transition in death easier.  But what is really incredible is Gyatso's precise description of the death process and what happens afterwards.  It's a map.  Gyatso<br />is the best writer of Buddhism in the twentieth century.  He is<br />simply a great man who has survived false accusations from the<br />henchmen of the Dali Lama.  This book will make you steady and straight. You might find the visualiztion of powa extremely difficult at first.  When ordering this book, also order \\"The<br />Medition Handbook\\" and \\"Joyful Path to Good Fortune\\" by the same author.

This is a really holistic approach!  For example,<br />the nutritive value of your food is greatly affected by what<br />mood you are in when you eat it.  I know that the author is authentic in these regards because of a comparison with Dr. Dhonden's books.  Tastes are important in dietary health.  And he tells you how to balance that.

We have two men in this book who display what we all want, what<br />we all need, and what we all really want to give. The great Bodhisattva, Langri Tangpa, wrote a poem consisting of eight<br />verses which tell us how to love.  They are mathematically precise.  The commentary is by the most brilliant writer<br />of Buddhism in the twentieth century, Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.  The result is incredible.<br />An algorythm of exact precision in which we can see how to love.<br />I know a person who can cause great trouble for me and my family. I see him as my Supreme Spititual Guide.  I see him as my Supreme Spititual Teacher.  He will burn up so much of my bad karma.  And he IS my Spiritual Teacher.  Because I hold him as such.  This is one of the eight verses by Langri Tangpa<br />who lived almost 1,000 years ago.  I slept pretty well last night.  I am scared now but I do not feel hate and anger surge<br />through my veins and arteries.  Geshe Kelsang's commentary<br />is brilliant.  And he gives a whole chapter on the preliminaries for meditating on love.  For you see, any label that we impute<br />on a person, place, or thing can be shown to be erroneous.  Your<br />hat may be &quot;great&quot; to you but it may be &quot;stupid&quot; to me.  By seeing and imputing worthwhile labels on people, for example, they will change.  And you will to.

Bob Sachs, author of \\"Tibetan Ayurveda\\", recommended this book to me.  I feel that Tibetan Medicine is the best system of medicine.<br />They believe that behavior determines health.  But the second<br />variable is food.  Their system is ayurvedic.  Based on body types.  But they don't have a suitable book out for sale.  This<br />book is Indian Ayurvedic.  Which is about 90% the same.  Each menu will tell you in numbers how much it matches your body type.  And there are other symbols which tell you about seasons and tastes and so forth.  This is all really quite simple.  But<br />I don't follow this book.  My reason is Indian Cooking.  All the meals are cooked using Indian Cooking.  You are supposed to put<br />mustard seeds on the frying pan and as soon as they start to pop, you start to put in other ingredients.  It has to do with timing.  You don't want the mustard seeds burnt or black.  This<br />is a small thing, I suppose.  But I bailed out when I got to that.

The Lamrim is the \\"Graduated Path to Enlightenment.\\"  It is a total map of the Buddhist Path.  And it is distilled, without any loss of flavor or potency, into these 21 meditations.  I<br />completed these meditations in 1997.  I made more progress than<br />I ever had in any spiritual or psychological program.  So I naturally started to do the meditations for a second 21-days.<br />I treated my family as myself or better.  I felt that life had meaning.  I felt part of you, the reader of this review, as well.<br />That there was a connection to everything else.  Then my brother<br />asked me what program I was doing.  I told him that it was the<br />Lamrim meditations of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.  He told me that the<br />Dali Lama was angry at him for worshipping a protector deity named Dorje Shugden.  So I quit.  Until now.  I did a one month exhaustive investigation of this affair.  I have found Geshe Kelsang Gyatso blameless.  And the Dali Lama was trying to keep his country intact because a book titled \\"The Yellow Book\\" was<br />dividing it.  This book portrayed Dorje Shugden as a hero entity that was protecting Tibet and driving away the Nyingma influences.  I am back.  And this book is the best.  It may not be the best for you.  But it is the best for me.  The 21 meditations are a concise psychological map for mental health.  I have known lamas and swamis who are quite mean-spirited.  But how<br />can you be mean if you are meditating on love?  The mind takes the form of whatever it is paying attention to.  After you have this book, you will see that the first meditation involves meditating on your Spiritual Guide.  Don't be frightened.  You can meditate on Geshe Kelsang Gyatso.  Or you can meditate on the Dali Lama.<br />Pick one of them as your Spititual Guide if you don't have a teacher of somekind.  The next problem that you might encounter is the meditation on Tranquil Abiding.  I just called The NKT<br />Center in Los Angeles to get an answer.  You can achieve tranquil abiding (the ninth stage) at home and in the evenings.<br />Students have done so.  This book is such a tremendous achievement.  You will have such great joy.  I am sorry that I quit.  And I wish you the very best of happiness.(the ninth stage) at home and in the evenings.<BR>Students have done so.  This book is such a tremendous achievement.

Chodren, a Tibetan Buddhist nun,<br />teaches us the basics of Buddhism in a question and answer format.  She answers all kinds of questions.  For the beginner<br />as well as the more advanced practioner.  If you are confused<br />about whether to buy this book or her &quot;Buddhism for Beginners&quot;,<br />buy this book.  This book has a preamble in the beginning of each chapter that teaches you the basics.  &quot;Buddhism for Basics&quot;<br />doesn't.

Here you can begin.  Everything that you need to begin is here.<br />The author's ability to help one understand the dharma is a little astonishing.  And really very wonderful.  He shows<br />Buddhism in a very objective light while making it personal at the same time.  Other authors can't seem to do this.  They can either do one or the other.  The chapter on karma alone will<br />obliterate you.  I had never seen this before!  And I want you to see it to.  Everything that you are experiencing at this moment is the effect of some action or thought which was the cause.  What you see in your room.  What you feel in your body.<br />What you look like. Your entire range of just being alive is a manifestation of your past actions.  It's like science fiction.<br />He explains this so simply and directly.  Everything you see, touch, smell, hear, feel is an outcome of what you have done in the past.  The chapters in this book are like little gemstones<br />that sparkle.  Do I like this book?  Yes.  Do I think that you should buy this book?  Definitely.	2002-08-17

And Buddhists who have succeeded.  I know that you may know a real lot about Buddhism.  And perhaps you have practiced for many years.  But these interviews are good.  And<br />I think that you will like them. Because they provide inspiration.  In the old days, people could have inspiration all the time because their teachers were near.

This is another series of talks given by Shunryu Suzuki who died<br />in 1971.  He seems to have been the greatest Zen Master in the<br />occidental world to date.  The first series of talks is in &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; which came out in 1970.  This seems to be the most inspirational book in Zen of our time.  Please buy both<br />of these treasures.  Please don't buy these two books (or one if<br />you already have &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind) if you believe that<br />this book will teach you zen formally.  The author makes it clear<br />that you need a teacher.  But once you have one, these two books are the most inspirational books that you can have.  I guess that<br />the most practical is still &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot; by Roshi Kapleau.  This second book of talks seems just as good as the first.  I don't know why Zen Center waited 32 years to print it.<br />Nevertheless, it is a real treasure.  Please don't treat this great man's teaching as basic.

The author is a Tibetan<br />nun in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism (the same as the Dali Lama).  So you will be taught to meditate in the same way that the Dali Lama meditates!  She does try to cover all schools of meditation.  But she still teaches primarily Tibetan.  And<br />her meditations are mainly Gelugpa.  What is so wonderful about this book is that it is for beginners.  But intermediates like<br />me can learn so much from it as well.  And for advanced practioners, I have no doubt that they can learn a thing or two as well.  You will find out how to sit.  When to sit.  How long to sit.  How to pick out a certain meditation. Dealing with problems frequently encountered in meditation.  How to deal<br />with negative problems such as depression, anger, and anxiety.<br />Nevertheless, I would only recommend this book to people who think they might want to practice in the Tibetan tradition.  Or<br />for people who want to practice Buddhist meditation but don't care what tradition they practice in.  This is really a great and helpful book.  Thank you.	2002-08-16

Early this morning, I gave<br />it one star and was a bit mean.  It didn't get through the submission process.  I said words to the effect that the Dali Lama was dictatorial about religious freedom.  And that he suppressed religious freedom in 1977 in regards to the Dorje Shugden controversy.  I talked to a NKT Buddhist nun this afternoon.  And she told me that if you are devoted to the Dali Lama as your teacher, then your practice is pure and you are practicing the dharma fully.  This is such a wonderful book.  With essays written by different authors.  And the pictures are almost breath-taking.  The layout of the pages is stunning.<br />And it just fabulous to read.  I know that you will enjoy it.

But when you go to the next page, you will see another picture of Lama Zopa Rinpoche with Lama Yeshe.  But now Lama Yeshe is a boy.  How?  This is his new incarnation.  Now we must keep an open mind.  We don't know about this.  Maybe Tibetans just find a preganant woman and say, &quot;That is the new incarnation.&quot;  Actually, their system of recognizing incarnations is pretty scientific.  But let us be skeptical.<br />But what if it is true?  Now read more into the book.  This book holds no punches.  We are lucky if we are reborn a human!  This<br />book may let us down, punch us on the jaw, and then hold us up.<br />But it will prepare you for what Buddhists really believe.  They believe in reincarnation into another form.  And you will be oh so lucky if it is a human the next time.  This book is brillant and concise.  It will cut you into a million pieces.  It will leave blisters on your hands.  Because despite your love for the teachings of His Holiness the Dali Lama or Sogyal Rinpoche, I am betting that you don't really know what they believe.  Buy this book and find out.

And since you are reading one of my reviews, I must<br />assume that you do have a low IQ.  But don't worry about it.<br />This book is just the very best.  It makes everything clear about the subject matter.  And it basically covers everything that you will need.  It does so in a very systematic manner.<br />And Wallace writes in a very clear mathematical manner (he is a physicist).  I do believe that you will enjoy reading this book like I did. But better yet, I think that it will make a very complicated subject easy to understand.  It's quite an accomplishment.  This is my favorite book on explaining Tibetan Buddhism.

There is a book written by the<br />Dali Lama that is just incredible!!!  And will blast you to the moon.  I'll get to that in a bit.  Because His Holiness refuses<br />to go native, his books center around a sort of floppy disc<br />form of global Buddhism (Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Buddhism in the West).<br />The book is not well-thought out.  Based on three sacred texts,<br />we try to deal with the topic of compassion.  And we do so to an<br />extent.  Mostly based on His Holiness'es talks in August, 1999,<br />we are left with a lot of form and little substance.  This is a good book if you are an adept practioner.  Geshe Kelsang Gyato's<br />books, on the otherhand, are a dream.  This is even admitted by<br />followers of the Dali Lama (there was a deep rift between the two parties in 1996-1998 that split Tibetan Buddhism into two<br />sects; Tibetan Buddhism and global Buddhism).  Gysatso's books are clear and lucid.  What makes me quite frustrated is that the<br />Dali Lama has written an absolutely tremendous book for you and me called \\"How to Practice.\\"  This book is tremondous and it deals virtually with everything one could possibly want to know in order to do Tibetan Buddhism in one's kitchen sink with a minimum of fuss.  For those of you who want to give me a negative vote for<br />knocking the Dali Lama, I am not doing so.  Nobody pays attention to \\"How to Practice\\" by the Dali Lama and my friends just get a bored look.  I say, \\"It's not what you think!  He even tells you how many pillows to put under your [bottom].\\"  And they say, \\"Yeah.  Yeah.  The Dali Lama is kewl man.\\"  Buy Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's books.  But then find yourself very suprised.  In \\"How<br />to Practice,\\" the Dali Lama hits a home run that is a grand slam. \\"How to Practice\\" came out in 2002, so keep an eye out for<br />it.  Buy the book above for helping out the Tibetans.  And it can add<br />some useful information.  But that is all.	2002-08-07

In reviewing this book, I would like to keep the subject matter as simple as possible.  Even though it is a complex issue.  I recently wrote a review for \\"Assert Yourself\\" by Sharon Bower.<br />And I have also written a review for \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie.  I am a caregiver for my eighty-year mother.  She is a real sweetheart.  And we are now great friends since her recent hospitalization.  This book is for parents AND caregivers.  But it has also been recommended<br />by many professionals for everyone to use.  \\"How to Win Friend and Influence People\\" has hurt me badly.  In communicating, I still find myself becoming manipilative.  Don't buy it.  Or buy it and see why I was hurt.  \\"Assert Yourself\\" has an acronym<br />of DESC.  D is DESCRIBE.  E is EXPRESS.  S is SPECIFY.  C is CONSEQUENCE.  Let's try it right now.  When you vote against my<br />review (D) I feel bad (E) and I would appreciate it if you<br />would vote for my review (S) and then I will write more (C).<br />The book that I am reviewing has a much softer ring to it.<br />BEHAVIOR + FEELING + EFFECT.  When you vote against my review (BEHAVIOR) I feel bad (FEELING) and than I don't want to write other reviews (EFFECT).  I feel that, despite my earlier review, assertiveness training is aggressive.  The approach of this book is beautiful.  And it works not just with kids, but with everyone.  Gordon calls it \\"owning your problem.\\"  You own what you feel 100%.  In assertiveness training, you are spelling out the way<br />you want things to be.  Active listening is also used in this book.  It is not manipulative.  You are simply echoing what the child or person is saying so that you both know what is happening at that moment.  \\"You feel that this review is too<br />long.\\"  Or \\" You feel that this is a good review but you don't understand a lot of it.\\"  It works to do active listening.  This is all only a part of what this book teaches in communicating.<br />I recommend it highly.	2002-05-11

The world seems to need to rid itself of the Big Three (Anger,<br />Depression, and Anxiety) or it will blow up!  But nothing seems<br />to work except people-centered therapy, biological psychiatry,<br />and twelve-step groups.  And these answers, very limited answers<br />mind you, have simply not worked on a global level.  Tibetan<br />Buddhism, although very promise-looking, has really offered<br />us nothing.  We have been kicked aside in two ways.  First, we<br />are supposed to shoot for enlightenment.  Or secondly, we need<br />a teacher.  The common man has been left with nothing.  Until<br />now...This book is written by a qualified Tibetan lama.  It is<br />for mental and physical strain.  And you simple do not need a<br />teacher to follow this program.  This is the first time that<br />Tibet has offered a \\"limited budget\\" man or woman a sandwich<br />that reduces Anger, Depression, and Anxiety.  This book will<br />certainly move us past the third revolution of psychiatry (psychopharmacology) into a fourth.  What could be called<br />meditational therapy.  The author outines in the back remedies<br />for psychiatric problems such as panic and depression.  The CD<br />may distract you.  His first line of defense are actual visualizations.  Than you can add the mayonaise and mustard<br />in the form of mudras (body or hand positions) and mantras<br />and chants.  The mudras and mantras make the actual visualizations more powerful.  He also gives you three degrees<br />of intensity.  I have three meditations for depression.  But<br />only one is at an easy intensity.  It is suggested that you<br />ease into each meditation session with nine preliminary conditions or checkpoints (like adjusting your posture). The<br />manual is so user-friendly that even psychotics and AIDS patients<br />can find great benefit.  One does not need a therapist to process<br />a meditation program.  The entire program is earmarked for potential psychic landmines.  I do hope that this great treasure<br />for mankind will usher in a fourth generation of psychiatry and<br />relieve the planet of so much stress.  Now do your part.  Buy<br />the book and CD.  I bless you from every region of my being.  Good luck.n a fourth generation of psychiatry and<br />relieve the planet of so much stress.  Now do your part.  Buy<BR>the book and CD.

According to Joseph Wolpe<br />(pronounced WOOL-PEE), the father of Behavior Therapy, the point<br />of these books is to inhibit fear around people through Affection<br />or Anger just as relaxation is used to inhibit fear of bugs,<br />heights, or crowds in systematic desensitization (psychotherapy<br />through reciprocal inhibition).  This particular text is the<br />favorite of the greatest researcher on depression of this or the last century (Dr. Martin Seligman, author of \\"Learned Optimism\\").<br />While homeless, I would use it in a free-floating style of going<br />nuts and then de-fusing my rage through positive action.  This positive action.  In this book.  Strangely, while writing this review, I got a call from a bill collector.

He instructs us in his A-B-C<br />system of mental health.  We have the Activating event (A),<br />the Beliefs that we hold (B), and the Consequences of those<br />beliefs (C).  (A) for me is writing this review.  (B) is my Belief that it must be a perfect review.  (C) is the Consequence<br />which I experience from that belief.  Which is anxiety.  When<br />we procrastinate, according to Ellis, we are holding irrational<br />(B)eliefs.  The more we (D)ispute these beliefs, the more healthy<br />(E)ffects of mental health we will experience.  Ellis also gives<br />us behavioral tools to help us eliminate our procrastination.<br />Such as a reward system.  Nevertheless, his system depends<br />on disputing the irrational beliefs.  There are two things that you might want to remember before you buy this wonderful book.<br />First, you have to use REBT (Rational-Emotive-Behavioral-Therapy) all the time.  It has to become a powerful philosophy in and of itself.  If you counter your procrastination ten minutes daily,<br />but then whip yourself with irrational thoughts and ideas the rest of the time, it won't work.  For this, you might want to go to the REBT website (...) for more information.  The second thing is that you might want to employ a Tibetan Buddhist technique to really dispute your irrational beliefs and to burn<br />in rational ones.  To do this, you sit in a chair.  Count to ten.  And after you have counted to ten without losing your count, you THEN dispute your irrational beliefs.  This is how<br />they burn in rational thoughts in the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.  Regardless, I hope that you enjoy this little<br />book.  And I wish you all the happiness in the world.	2001-12-18

Learning scripts in order to resolve conflicts with<br />others.  And to enhance communication skills.  But sometimes we have to look at the energy behind our conflicts.  &quot;Darling (eyes<br />glaring or bulging), may we discuss this problem (fists clenching).&quot;  You see?  Another person can feel your anger no matter how much you sugar-coat it!  But...once the negative<br />emotion dissolves, this book can be invaluable.  In another of<br />Gabor's books (&quot;How to Start a Conversation and Make Friends&quot;), he gives<br />a suggestion that is simple but great.  When people are asking you questions that are so personal that they make you cringe, just say, &quot;I'd rather not say.&quot;  In fact, I call it the I'D RATHER NOT SAY method.  This is where Gabor and his books really help. Once you have softened your heart muscles to other<br />people, than these methods can really help you with other people.

The author gives us many chapters<br />on what depression is really like.  Also, meditations or<br />reflections on how to understand depression better.  But we are<br />not given concise instructions on how to reduce the pain of depression.  I have been studying depression for thirty-five years.  Depression, I believe, is caused by a loss of our attachment<br />or desires.  To reduce depression, we reduce desires.  Very simply put:  desire =  depression.  It is simply impossible for a desireless human being to be deeply depressed about anything.<br />I believe that any of the Buddhist paths reduce or eliminate depression.  I picked the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism<br />(the same as His Holiness the Dali Lama) because of it's precision.  One-half of all desires can be systematically eliminated<br />with two meditations.I<br />would recommend this book to all Zen practioners who have trouble with depression.  For them, it will be a blessing.	2001-12-18

This is THE work for the Gelugpa Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.<br />Which is the tradition of His Holiness, the Dali Lama.  It, for<br />all practical reasons, is our Bible.  While reading it, one becomes relaxed and feels at home.  It outlines the entire path of the Lam-Rim or the graduated path of enlightenment.  Pabonka<br />Rinpoche gave a famous twenty-four day discourse on the teachings<br />of the Buddha.  These talks were translated by Trijang Rinpoche,<br />the tutor of His Holiness.  Finally, it was translated into English by Michael Richards.  This book is a masterpiece.  Each page fills the soul and heart with happiness and love.  The illustrations are just marvelous.  A couple caveats are in order before you buy this marvelous book.  First, please understand that, despite what a few Occidental iconoclasts believe, Tibetan<br />Buddhism flatly espouses a belief in cyclical existence.  That at death, unless we have lived a life of firm morality and generosity, the mindstream can spin out of control and just about be reborn in any lifeform.  In Tibetan Buddhism, this is a given.  Secondly, is the belief in sin.  The belief that if we<br />harm others, the arrow comes back at us.  And this karma is expandable.  Yes.  Bad things do happen to good people.<br />With these two understandings under your belt, buy and enjoy.<br />The vision which Pabonka Rinpoche gives us may seem horrible.  Nevertheless, it may be true.  In fact, it no doubt is true.  May the dharma bless you.	2001-12-16

This book contains a series of meditations to help us develop compassion.  And what is compassion?  The wish for others not<br />to suffer.  This is simply a wonderful book!  In it, we learn about the psychology of other human beings.  One suprising thing is that we all want the same thing!  Happiness.  But most of us seem stupid about obtaining it.  In all human endeavors and in all human relationships, what quality of mind really makes them work?  Compassion.  Hopkins brillantly illustrates this.  Think<br />about it.  What type of marriage partner would you really want?<br />One who wishes that you would not suffer.  And what is this wish?<br />It is compassion.  So we all want a partner with compassion.  We all want friends with compassion.  What type of business relationship would you want with someone?  We want someone who can feel for us.  Someone who will understand if we get sick and can't make a deadline.  We want someone with compassion.  Paradoxically, compassion is the key to success.  Because no one would really want any kind of relationship with us, personal or otherwise, unless we have compassion.  Can compassion be bought?  Yes!  Oddly enough.  Buy this book and do a series of meditations in which you will feel for others.  In which you will understand others.  This book is for everyone.  The world needs compassion.  And it is what everyone wants.  Thank you.	2001-12-16

And some people say I'm awful smart.<br />The book divides us humans into twelve categories.  Each<br />category corresponds to an animal.  Then we are all divided into five more categories.  These are wood, fire, earth, metal, and<br />water.  So all of humanity is divided into sixty categories.<br />If I can be serious for a moment, which isn't easy sometimes,<br />this is a very good book for business and human relationships.<br />It is not the definitive book on business and human relationships.  It has to be used properly.  In a fashion to understand others and situations.  Not to judge,<br />moralize, or condemn.  I do think that Suzanne White is the<br />best astrologer alive.  I think that I have explored all the popular writers in the last thirty years.  The very best book<br />on the subject, I still believe, is Suzanne White's &quot;The New Astrology.&quot;  That book and this book make a good team if used with discretion.  In this book, we are entirely exposed to the<br />subject of &quot;Chinese&quot; Astrology.  She gives a description<br />of the twelve animals.  This is further divided into the sixty<br />when we add the elements.  She gives a future outlook for<br />all animals up to the year 2008.  The book is large.  Over 500<br />pages.  This is mainly because of the range.  By this, I mean that one can use this text for fun or for very serious matters.<br />The range of this book is what I think seperates it from other<br />Chinese astrology books that I have seen.  Some are &quot;cute.&quot;<br />Some take themselves deadly serious.  This book is versatile.<br />It's also a bit hard-hitting.  The author doesn't believe in pulling punches in regards to her descriptions of personality types.  Nor is she careful in sparing our feelings in regards<br />to our relationships.  She descibes one relationship of mine as<br />a &quot;catastrophe.&quot;  It is this clarity and the versatility which<br />make this and &quot;The New Astrology&quot; good fine texts for business<br />and professional people who simply don't want to get into &quot;all that.&quot;  Namely, astrology.  For those who believe that astrology<br />does indeed hold something that is valuable and useful, but<br />who don't want to examine why, I can think of no other author who can help us.  Help us to get into the &quot;real stuff&quot; of the<br />subject while not getting our hands dirty with &quot;the stars.&quot;<br />Buy this book and &quot;The New Astrology.&quot;  Don't tell anybody that you do put any value on astrology.

Unless you are a child, animal or stupid; you are miserable.<br />Ah!  If only we could all be stupid.  This book is about becoming happy even if you are not stupid.  The author<br />guides us along the mythical &quot;yellow brick road&quot; with eight<br />steps.  Skillful understanding, skillful thinking, skillful<br />speech, skillful action, skillful livelihood, skillful effort,<br />skillful mindfulness, and skillful concentration.  These can<br />be played sequentially, and then, at random.  Each one increasing the intensity of the others like music.  One eventually<br />becomes a &quot;happy being.&quot;  One of those rare and frightening<br />apparitions.  You know the kind.  People who are happy listening<br />to Barry Manilow.

Daily contact with who has followed the Buddha's path<br />for at least ten years is a good way to see for yourself whether the teachings work.&quot;  Take it from a veteren, the teachings work.<br />But there are a lot of &quot;teacher-morons&quot; out there.  Believe me!<br />They only became teachers because they are in more pain than you and me.  The author is off point here.  And we have to face<br />another issue.  The teachings in this book are distincively<br />Sri Lankan Buddhist.  They will not interface with a good Zen<br />teacher.  I've mentally thrown this book out.  I bought<br />&quot;Mindfulness with Breathing&quot; by Buddhadasa Bhikku.  This is<br />a Thai Buddhist guide to meditation.  And I'm turning myself<br />into the Wai Thai Temple.  The only Buddhist Thai monestery<br />in the United States.  They all have orange robes and shaven heads.  I make up these reviews as I go along.

I learned a lot from this &quot;Comprehensive<br />Guide to Tibetan Buddhism.&quot;  But I have read thirty or forty<br />books on the subject.  And this is still a HEAVY meal.  If<br />you do want to really know about Tibetan Buddhism in an<br />&quot;intermediate&quot; fashion, then please buy and read the book.<br />You will learn a lot.  I was dissapointed to learn that one of the Dali Lama's was a romantic poet and womanizer who did<br />very little spiritual practice!  And that the Chinese organized<br />massive &quot;gang rapes&quot; in order to subjagate the Tibetan people.<br />So I learned a lot.  But I still wished that there was less detail and more clarity.

And from a Tibetan viewpoint.  Before buying the book, you will have to ask yourself if the Tibetan viewpoint of death is valid.  Or<br />does it have any validity.  Or could it have any validity.<br />If not, then don't buy the book.  If you feel that it may<br />or you don't know, then this book could help determine how<br />you will experience the next million years.  Not just after death,<br />mind you.  But from the day that you read the first page.<br />The forward is by His Holiness the Dali Lama.  I have the book with me right now.  I have read it from cover to cover.  So<br />allow me to describe it in a little more detail.  In order<br />for you to make a decision about buying it.<br />The introduction is by the noted Tibetan scholar, Robert Thurman.<br />So along with the Dali Lama's contribution, we know that this<br />book may be a breakthrough in regards to what happens after<br />death.  In the same lines as Sogyal Rinpoche's &quot;The Tibetan<br />Book of Living and Dying,&quot; Paramahansa Yogananda's &quot;The Autobiography of<br />a Yogi,&quot; and Betty J. Eadie's &quot;Embraced By The Light.&quot;<br />If you have not read those books, I suggest that you do so in able to make a judgement call about where we go.  Back to our book at hand.<br />In chapter two, we really get the full works.  I would like to quote just one sentence from that chapter for you.  &quot;There are<br />eighteen volumes of return-from-death stories that give detailed<br />accounts of the bardo and of rebirth.&quot;  So the author, a qualified lama, is telling us that the Tibetans have done numerous studies of what happens after death.  And as he relates in this chapter, what can happen can be absolutely horrible.<br />Nightmarish.  Worse than what we can imagine.  The author<br />goes on to state that we move into a completely different &quot;apartment&quot; after we die.  But the nature of that<br />&quot;apartment&quot; will be determined by our thoughts, words, and actions<br />in this life.  The new &quot;apartment&quot; (body and environment) can be<br />a paradise or an absolute hell.  Depending on what we do now.<br />Therefore, the remaining chapters, until the last one, tell us how we can be good in the Tibetan sense.  Right now.  I zoned<br />in on his emphasis of compassion, love, and patience.  It seems,<br />from his writing, that we will have a heavenly experience if<br />we have these three characteristics!  This would explain the heavenly near-death experiences by so many people.  Murderers,<br />child molestors, rapists; these individuals will experience horrible hells for thousands of years.  If not millions.<br />Nevertheless, they to can change.<br />This book is a must read for anybody concerned about death in any capacity.  Which is about all of us, I would imagine.

This book was written by an iconoclastic lama.  I read it twice<br />before I sold it (and you're not supposed to sell dharma books!).<br />The author gives the outlandish belief that the rules of the<br />vinaya (monastic order) were simply created so that they could<br />get along with one another!  And had nothing to do with<br />cause-and-effect karma!  So much for the Gelukpa Order of<br />Tibetan Buddhism.  Nevertheless, his chapter on the use<br />of alcohol to hasten enlightenment and his account of a lama<br />stopping rain in his prescence are incredible!  Well worth<br />reading even if you disagree.  Meditation techniques are<br />good, but a little too advanced.  The author also refers<br />to having moral precepts as being &quot;drag factors&quot;.  They drag<br />down altruistic intent.  I belong to the Gelukpa Order so I<br />should be giving this book one star.  But I recommend it for<br />everyone.  Priceless information contained inside.  He will<br />also stop you from using an alarm clock with a button that<br />delays your awake by ten minutes!  Just read it.	2001-10-01

And it should be good reading for the layman or laywoman as well as mental health professionals.  Unfortunately, the subject matter needs serious surgery.  When we try to smear a \\"rational\\" reference point over a reference point, we are still left with the whole problem.  A reference point! People with mental problems (as if there is anyone without \\"mental problems\\"), have too many reference points.  As the author explains to us, our pain is caused by \\"cognitive distortions.\\"  That we lost our job or our spouse is highly undesirable.  But it is not \\"terrible.\\"  We can still go on.  Life is still worth living.  And so on.  This is substituting a sandwich full of nails for a sandwich full of paste. We are still left with too many sandwiches and way too much paste.  His Holiness the Dali Lama is the head of the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition of Gelukpa Buddhism.<br />In these teachings, it is stated that one did not lose either a job or our spouse. These are just labels!  And they are cognitive distortions within themselves.  In the former case, we were informed that we would no longer be coming to a place and receiving money.<br />In the latter case, someone stopped breathing.  By taking out our Label Maker and creating new and apparently more 'rational' labels, we are saying that words are real.  And this is the entire problem with the neurotic and the psychotic (not including the fact that someone labeled them a \\"neurotic\\" or a \\"psychotic\\").  The cure is seeing through all labels.<br />Then we can relax and feel friendly in a harshly defined universe.  There is not one interpretation that we can make of anything that can't be shown as invalid when we view it from another angle.  So why interpret phenemona as anything unless it serves a utilitarian purpose?	2001-09-30

Tibetan Buddhism is a &quot;touchy&quot; subject once we go<br />past our common agreement that the Dalai Lama is a &quot;nice guy.&quot;<br />In the Dali Lama's tradition, there are lower rebirths in which<br />one may be in hell for millions of years.  And in which a human rebirth is considered rare.  The author will talk about &quot;spirit<br />harm&quot;.  This tradition also believes, like Hinduism and Christianity, in spirit possession.  Once we try to understand<br />these concepts with an Einsteinian view as opposed to a<br />Newtonian one of seperate objects existing within and by themselves, we can then set the preliminaries to a new kind of<br />healing.  The author provides remedies, but not certain cures,<br />for anything crummy that might happen to you.  And since this<br />tradition (Gelukpa) is not supposed to lie, I would believe the<br />claims that he makes.  This is the one book that I would want by my bedside if I were dying of AIDS.  By doing a very advanced but simple practice called &quot;tonglen&quot;, one can transmute<br />one's own disease into one of helping all beings everywhere.<br />And ironically enough, this seems to be the best cure for<br />seemingly fatal and hopeless diseases!  The author states that<br />there has only been one recorded recovery from AIDS through<br />meditation, but I believe that this may increase as we study<br />Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan Medicine more closely.  Perhaps you will only be able to accept these cures when you let down<br />our view of a &quot;skin-encapsulated&quot; ego and invite a vision<br />of an interconnected world.  Otherwise, most of this beautiful and wonderful content will be dismissed as superstition.  If the reader can remain logical but not judgemental, he or she could find themselves not only healed, but even healthier and happier than before.  Thank you and I wish you well.	2001-09-27

Lama Zopa Rinpoche discusses Mahayana Thought Transformations. These are statements or views that we can use in our everyday life to massively destroy suffering and create happiness.  In Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that all our suffering is caused by selfishness or what Lama Zopa Rinpoche calls, &quot;self-cherishing.&quot;  We all have comitted selfish acts in the past. We must experience the results in the future.  But we can experience all these problems in such a way as to put a stop on all suffering sometime in the future.  Simply because the impetus of suffering has lost it's ability to cause a  chain reaction.  Lama Rinpoche gives plenty of thought transformations.  And a comprehensive list is given in the back. Some of these ideas may strike the reader as a bit strange. Using suffering to destroy suffering.  As Harry Truman said, &quot;The buck stops here!&quot;  In this book, &quot;The suffering stops here.  I blame all this suffering on selfish actions and thoughts which I have performed in the past.  I will not blame anybody.  And I am suffering for all beings.&quot;  Having done so, Lama Zopa Rinpoche explains how this stops suffering.  Usually, when we experience a problem, we blame other people, places, or things. This blaming increases our self-cherishing stance.  &quot;If only my tire didn't go flat...&quot; and so forth.  We can learn to like suffering so that we can put a stop at it's nucleus.  Which is that suffering leads to more selfish actions.  Lama Zopa Rinpoche even goes as far as stating that we can enjoy suffering like eating ice cream or listening to classical music!  You can actually experience problems, which are the result of selfish actions, and state, &quot;Well!  I got rid of that selfish action. My tire went flat!&quot;  This may sound strange.  The author is not asking you to stick your hand into a fire.  He is just asking you to give Mahayana Thought Transformations a try.  Or as Jesus said, &quot;Ye Reap What Ye Sow.&quot;  The object of this book is to sow no more.  You have been in pain long enough.  So buy this book and give it a good test run.

Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams that everything that we do is motivated by making pain less.  This is why people follow the path of the Buddha or eat ice cream on a  hot day.  To reduce pain.  Matthew Flickstein is a psychotherapist carrying a big stick in this book.  The greatest classic in Insight Meditation is &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; by the Ven. Henepola Gunaratana.  The preface to this book is written by him and it is full of accolades for this man and his work.  So let's cut to the chase.  Flickstein, Tara Bennett-Goleman , and Jack Kornfield hypothesize that NO MATTER HOW MANY HOURS YOU MEDITATE - IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD IF PAST ISSUES ARE NOT RESOLVED!  As you can imagine, if this is true, a lot of people are wasting their time.  Here is a quote from this book.  Page 58.  &quot;This phenomena is similar to what happens during the sport of bungee jumping...the jumper falls through space, the bungee cord stretches to its fullest extent, then snaps back, taking the individual along with it. Similarily, if we jump into the context level of our minds  without having dealt with our content issues, we can only go so  far before we are snapped back by the issues to which we are emotionally tied.&quot;  Flickstein explains that contextual issues are Insight Meditation.  And content issues involve incidents in our past which simply cannot be resolved by meditation.  But they can be resolved by exercises.  I did the first exercises. I imagined my father coming into a room and I forgive him. We talk according to an algorhtym that Matthew has designed. And this exercise is supposed to resolve content issues. Today, I did the visualiztion exercise with my mother.  I don't feel any different.  But Matthew doesn't tell the reader whether he or she should do the exercise once, or five hundred times. The authour also states that low self-esteem is caused by faulty programming in the past.  Both Zopa Rinpoche and Paramahansa Yogananda state that low self-esteem can be cured by helping and loving others.  First.  Then the self-esteem follows. The author wants you to sit for 45 to 60 minutes daily doing Insight Mreditation which deals with your contextual issues. Then he asks you to keep a journal in order to deal with your past &quot;content&quot; issues.  But why would you even do Insight Meditation if it does very little good?  If your past issues are not yet resolved?  Matthew?  Where are you?em can be cured by helping and loving others.  First.  Then the self-esteem follows.

He preferred the latter usage.  I saw him personally for nine months.  Ken has a huge intellect and a very insightful mind.  He is also very opinionated.  This book is wonderful.  It is like a manual on fixing your car and adjusting the headlights.  It's about 500 pages.  The reason it is so wonderful is that it describes the mind like a technical manual.  You will need a teacher after buying the book.  But this is a misnomer.  You do the exercises that you can so that purification can take place.  The teacher than appears.  This doesn't mean that you don't take action. You don't expect your teacher to appear in your living room! Ken quotes Bob Dylan in this book!  That is sort of refreshing.  Ken is the director of &quot;Unfettered Mind&quot; in Venice.  He was  one of the first of four Occidental lamas in the West.  If you buy the book, you have started.  It's a step toward having a teacher.  And you will learn so much. Oh. Ken once had his finger in my face.  He told me that I &quot;globalize&quot; in everything.  Money, religion, woman.  Buy the book anyway. I just don't like being told the truth.	2001-06-21

The author suffered from manic-depression.  And he shows all of us how to cure our depression. There are twelve Golden Keys.  Twelve chapters to cover all aspects of a good treatment plan for depression.  The author has been there.  He has been what he calls a &quot;vegetable.&quot; One who stays indoors and does nothing but watch TV.  Not cleaning.  Afraid to go outside the front door.  Almost like a vampire afraid of the light and other people.  Major<br />depression is a nightmare for so many of us.  Doing fifteen minutes of cognitive therapy will simply will not do it.  Indulging in talk therapy simply will not do it.  Going to church once a week will simply not do it.  One needs a tank. A bazooka.  A machine gun.  One needs a multi-dimensional approach.  And this is what this book does.  Let's begin. Mind you, this is my interpretation of the 12 Golden Keys. First, find a Higher Power and stick to it.  Equivocating about this or that path during your recovery will only make your depression worse.  Simply because you are not dealing with the problem of depression.  Pick a Higher Power and stick to it until you recover.  Second, do a personal health inventory.  This is included in the book. Third, you will need to decide if hospitaliztion is necessary for you.  This is very important and may save your life. The guidelines are given in the book.  Fourth, get a support team.  Like the Godfather, surround yourself with people who can help you.  Fifth, keep your emotions intact during your recovery.  Your recovery must have first priority.  Don't get a divorce or join the Navy. Diet and Nutrition are sixth.  Drink lots of water.  At least 20% of your diet should be whole uncooked food. What we eat does affect our minds. Seventh, meditation and journal writing are healing.  Do them and start small. The same with exercise.  The author tells you how to start.  Eighth, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!  Preferably for one hour a day.  This is the real killer.  Hibernation.  This is death.  Get out or get dead.  Number nine involves planning a schedule.  This does so much for depression.  He tells you how.  Tenth, go to support groups.  The author provides his own suggestion of an ideal group format.  But the main thing is to share your depression with others.  Eleven, find a positive meaning for your depression.  And plug this into your conception of a Higher Power.  Twelve, stay where you are.  No big gulps. One day at a time.  This book is simply a wonderful gem for all mental health professionals.  And for all those who suffer from depression.  I have studied each chapter and I am applying the concepts and methods to my life.  And I am sorry to the author for any errors that I might have made in this review.  Buy the book and get well.  Just one day at a time.  That's the most anybody can do.  Thank you.al killer.  Hibernation.  This is death.  Get out or get dead.  Number nine involves planning a schedule.

First, you need to buy &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; by Dale Carnegie.  Or you will be very confused.  Then you have to use the techniques and discover if this sort of product is for you.  If it is, then buy &quot;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&quot; by Dale Carnegie.  Then try those techniques. If both these books are your cup of tea, then buy this book. It goes beyond these two books with plenty examples of Carnegie's tecniques for success in a more technological atmosphere. Goals are a big thing in this book.  The one main criticism of this book is that it doesn't deal with character.  What Stephen Covey, the management expert, calls &quot;truncating the character base.&quot;  This is based on the idea that you have to be a good guy and gal in order to succeed.  This book does not deal with the moral structure of a leader.  Positive thinking, goal imagery, ethusiasm -- these and other elements of leadership are dealt with. Lying and manipulation are not dealt with in any true fashion.  Thank you.	2001-06-19

I'll do all the work and you can do all the listening.  After we search our brains out on the web for the ultimate hatha yoga teacher, we will come to this man.  It is inevitable.  It seems that there are Iyengar Yoga Institutes all over the world.  Start searching or just listen to me.  And now he has written a book which requires no teacher.  You will be introduced to a 20-week yoga program.  I've done the five rites and some Power Yoga, but it really comes down to a firm commitment.  And I know I will never be able to do better than this in health care.<br />In order to help you decide whether to buy the book, I will need to give you some facts.<br />Yes.  The book does cost ....  It also has 1,900 color photographs.  And it is so heavy that I am using it as  a bookend for my other books.  True!  It's worth the .... Believe me.<br />Iyengar believes in the Yoga Sutras by Pantanjali. This is Hindu Yoga.  The book goes into some detail about this.<br />His Holiness the Dali Lama states in &quot;The World of Tibetan Buddhism&quot; that this is a &quot;Brahma&quot; Vehicle.  This is a path that will lead you into the realm of form (astral rebirth) and the formless realm (causal rebirth).  But that is it. There is no &quot;wisdom-realizing&quot; emptiness as in Tibetan Buddhism. Afterwards, you will return to one of the hells since you burned up all your good karma.  Whether these hells are real or a projection of one's own mind is a mute point since one will experience them regardless.  So be responsible for the philosophy if you decide to go further into yoga.<br />You do not need to use props.  They are highly desirable. But not essential.  Addresses of where you can buy these cushions, blocks, and so forth are listed in the back of the  book on page 416.  I think that you had better plan on spending $100 or more if you really want to get set up this way. Yours truly is using a wall and a blanket.  I can't afford the props right now.<br />There are all kinds of health problems which these postures can help.  The book lists quite a few.  All the way from skin problems to helping your immune system work properly.  Each problem has photographs of the postures to do!<br />In the 20 week yoga program, we will be going from 12 exercises to 47!  I'm just starting out from the top.  A few now.  And add on a couple more.  I just want you to know that his is a long program unless you cheat.  Like I am doing.  I highly recommend it in this case.<br />If you have heard of Krishnamurti, this is the program that he did.  Two hours daily!  He also did fast walking.  Iyengar does not believe in any exercise that might case strain or puffing and huffing.  You can deal with that as you will with the philosophy issue cited above.<br />What else can I do to help?  I have the book right here. Boy is it beautiful!  Sorry.  That just slipped out. I guess that is about all.  And from my research, this is the best exercise program that you can do.  Scientists are confused now about aerobic activity.  They keep lowering the amount of such exercise needed every few years. I wonder when they will get down to zero.<br />All I can say is that if you want the best, buy the book. I've gone through so many programs and done so much research.  I wish you well.  I really do.  And if I have helped you any, I am happy.r />There are all kinds of health problems which these postures can help.  The book lists quite a few.

Also, a very upsetting one. The &quot;Tibet in Exile&quot; website claims that Tibet had women's rights. This book by the Dalai Lama's mother claims otherwise. In Amdo, which is Eastern Tibet, they had a custom  that seemed to work for adultery. But not for women. The family of the woman who was the offender were required to kill her. Dike Tsering goes into more detail. Also, if a man died leaving his wife alone, she was required not to marry for three years. Then the family would conduct &quot;secret negotiations&quot; for profit. This caused many Tibetan women to commit suicide. The book also displays the tremendous impact of astrology. How you got married, who you married, and so forth. The astrologer was consulted on all matters of importance in the family. And there were ghosts. One ghost was resposible for the deaths of four of her children. In Lhasa, there were tremendous class distinctions! And Diki Tsering displays them simply as horrible snobs. This applys to the aristocrats who lived off their &quot;bonded laborers&quot;. And wouldn't even call them by name. They also acted like Diki Tsering was nothing but &quot;a farm hand&quot;. The two regents who controlled Tibet while the Dalai Lama was growing up were Reting Rinpoche and Taktra Rinpoche. Reting was the first regent, until he was supposedly assasinated by Taktra Rinpoche. The author also believes, as did the people of Tibet, that Taktra Rinpoche poinsoned her husband, the father of the Dalai Lama, because he was friends with Reting Rinpoche. Nevertheless, Reting Rinpoche was not without violence. A Tsipan Lungshar led a  movemovement for reform. Reting Rinpoche had his eyes goughed out as punishment. I find the testimony of Diki Tsering very good. She is really strong and seems to speak with great truth. I believe her about the ghosts and the astrology. But about the other issues, and as a follower of Tibetan Buddhism, I am more depressed than usual! But I do feel that this is a must read for people who do want to save Tibet. We have to know our &quot;weakspots&quot; so that they don't come back later to haunt us. And I don't mean ghosts! Please buy and read the book.

And by a beautiful human being. But we have to see where we are going. The author has, intentionally or unintentionally, created a new therapy. It is called Emotional Alchemy. Emotional Alchemy begins  with Insight Meditation. Vipassana. The author then combines Insight Meditation beautifully with Schematic Therapy. She lists ten &quot;schemas&quot; for people with deep emotional problems. This book can be a Godsend. But the author is creating a new therapy. Does it work? I went to the website listed by her in the back of the book. They have 16 &quot;schemas&quot; listed there. As opposed to her 10. I took the long test there and scored 55% on &quot;Entitlement&quot;. Tara Bennett-Goleman suggests that one concentrates on the largest &quot;shema&quot; at once. Like Jack Kornfield, she believes that meditation can not cure mental illness. We have certain  parts of our brains which will simply deny access no matter what. Even until we die. The wonderful revalations that come through this book is that she simply tells you where she is going to and where she has come from. This is entirely ignored by well-meaning new-age gurus such as Kornfield and Levine. They give out meditations in their books which more or less proclaim themselves as Buddhas! Tara Bennett-Goleman does no such thing. Her works are based on cognitive therapy, neuroscience, and insight meditation. With a foreward by the Dalai Lama, this is a pivotal work toward helping those with<br />emotional problems. After seven years of homelessness, I still fall into the &quot;schema&quot; of Entitlement. You will also spot the schemas of Deprivation (emotional), Subjagation, Unloveability, ans so on. She is really postulating a theory in this book. Certain parts of the brain can not be accessed without something deeper than meditation. I appauld her efforts. Especially since she is not trying to merge Western Psychology with Buddhism as the authors that I mentioned are trying to do.<br />But Insight Meditaion co-joined with Schematic Therapy will simply need more work. I think she may do it. But not in this book. I shall wait. Both the book and the author are real gems. Buy the book and get ready for a &quot;seperate&quot; Buddhist Therapy.

We first become aware, through his excellent research and writing, of Mary's background. As we read, the author expands beyond to include Mary Pringle. But it is really the title of the book that expresses the experience of the reading. Mary's world or environment. And once a character has been created by their world, we can frequently predict the outcome which will come despite all other influences. What makes this better than other biographies is that we can simply see how certain &quot;social patterns&quot; become so ingrained into us that they finally becomed a part of us. Etched into the marrow of our bones. Until we eventually become that world. That environment. The author widens his scope in this book to include the background of Mary without giving detail after detail. Then he accompanies her and her relative's journals with facts which &quot;cushion&quot; our sight without an agenda. We are left to put the pieces of the puzzle together ourselves. I truly hope that this biography will be an inspiration for other biographers to follow suit. I do like this new comprehensive approach of allowing us to see the whole scale of a person's exististential dilemma. I no longer think that we are &quot;free autonomous human beings&quot;. We touch each other's limbs. I am very gateful to the author for this insight.	2001-01-26

(but don't worry about it if you behave)	This book is a complete masterpiece. Dr. Yeshe Dhonden will explain to you the nature of Health and all that name implies. He is the father of Tibetan Medicine. He was His Holiness the Dalai Lama's personal physician. His incredible insights are easy to understand and make this book a &quot;Must Buy&quot; for anyone who wants their family and themselves to remain happy, healthy, and wise! The man is incredible.<br />You will need to buy and study the book. But I will give you a brief &quot;run down&quot;. Phlegm, bile, and wind are the three Tibetan humors in us which regulate our health. If they are perfectly balanced, one is in super-human health. The primary factors in governing the humors are behavior and nutrition. Good behavior is the most important and consists of following the ten positive actions and avoiding the ten negative actions. I can't go into these in a review, but they are &quot;non-killing&quot;, &quot;non-stealing&quot;, and so forth. By hurting others, we crack our own heads. The humors become imbalanced, and then bugs or small organisms invade the body and cause cancer and other diseases. These bugs are the primary cause of diseases. But not the sole cause. My mother had these bugs popping out of her (six out of seven can be seen with the naked eye). Half-a-dozen doctors believed her mad. As did all of her loved ones. Dr. Dhonden suggests to physicians that they do not go immediately to surgery because these bugs might spread and cause mastasis.<br />Without knowing anything about Tibetan Medicine, my mother would give herself a self-massage. These bugs would pop out of all pores of her skin. Dr. Yeshe Dhondon, in this book, gives a more thorough analysis. The seven kinds of organisms are in the air. We ingest them with the lungs. They go into the bloodstream and then inhabit in our bodies. Then they spread to all areas. It is not these organisms or &quot;bugs&quot; which cause the disease. It is if these organisms are sick. And they are frequently sick because of pollution and the impure foods that we eat. So &quot;sick bugs&quot; are the cause of both cancer and AIDS. Good behavior and pure foods can help us to prevent many horrible diseases. This is why this book is such a gem. If you are a Seven-Day Advantist Christian, you are probably during pretty good prevention! The ten commandments and  vegetarianism come pretty close to a comprehensive &quot;health plan&quot;. So this book is simply an incredible introduction of Tibetan<br />Medicine for everyone! No one is excluded. If I get angry right now, the humor of &quot;bile&quot; will increase. This will increase the habitation of these organisms. That is, making a safe refuge for them to multiply. Impure foods (the Tibteans do not prohibit beer or even meat in our diets) will increase their number. They will spread throughout the body. A tumor may result. This is why good behavior is so well-emphasized. Because of the physical-mental changes that result in the body which are &quot;emotionally charged&quot; by doing certain actions. This is not a &quot;moral judgement&quot;. If you slap your spouse with a blank mind, the imbalance might not occur (or occur very little!). But if you slap your wife with a mind full of rage, then the imbalance will occur. Dr. Dhonden will explain to you these ten unskillful actions. So buy this book. And get and stay well.

Perhaps both	This book is brillantly written. And the author is a man of great substance. His ability to make deductions, intelligent deductions, is incredible. And in the back of the book are simply incredible photographs of UFO's and other evidence (such as the &quot;crop circles&quot; which no one can explain). But we do have to deal with the man. Before I tell you some of his deductions, we have to ascertain whether he has the experience and education to conduct such a monumental work. In appendix one, you will find out his personal history. It is quite impressive, to say the least. Surfice it for me to simply state that he acquired his Master's Degree in electrical engineering and specialized in the study of &quot;electron device physics&quot;. The author reminds  me of John Lilly, the scientist who claimed that dolphins were smarter than us. It is just that their fortes are in philosophy, music, and even the understanding of rebirth. Yet dispite Lilly's contentions, Moyer has evidence and is more objective in his findings. There is much comparison in this book with other sources, such as Johnathan Swift and others. But Moyer really concentrates on three areas. First, The Urantia Book. Second, the Bible. And third, alien abductions. Then he trisects these three sources until he reaches &quot;common denominators&quot;. Moyer comes to the definite conclusion that aliens are benevolent. Further, that they are &quot;angels&quot; or devas in Hinduism and Buddhism. They are here to help us, not harm us. And to carry out God's plan. Then why do so many abductees state that aliens are malevonent? Moyer states that we &quot;project&quot; onto the aliens our fears and terrors. This makes alien abductions nightmarish for those people who have psychological problems. Moyer sees a universe that is totally benevolent. His main  concern seems to be our psychological reactions to to our alien visitors. He also claims that if Jesus came down here today, many of us would dismiss all of what He says, or at least a part of it. Despite Moyers deductions, this would explain why aliens come here and simply want no contact. That is, visiting the president and having dinner. They are here to help us. And if we resist them, which is the same as dismissing God's will, than we will become terrified and experience them as violent demons. But this is only the case if we project our hidden fears and terrors onto them. If you watch X-Files or are interested in alien abductions, I would highly recommend this book. Moyer is extremely intelligent and insightful.  This book needs to be on your shelf if you are interested in these phenomenas in any capacity. The documentation and beautiful pictures in the book are worth the price alone. I'm putting my copy beside my &quot;heavy duty&quot; philosophy books.

This book is the pioneer and forerunner of this concept. Later Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche would come out with &quot;Mastering Successful Work&quot;.  A sequel to this book. &quot;Skillful Means&quot; is his bestselling work to date. Why? Because, to be frank, most people want to be happy and just don't have the time to study and meditate as well. And with familys, the issue is a mute one. There is no time. But if we can convert our working time and taking care of the kids, transform this time, into gaining insight spiritually, then, well, WOW! I have read this book 11 times (yes, eleven!). More than any other book that I have ever read. You will be given a series of lessons on work. When we have lots to do, we tense up. We get the adrenaline flowing. Which is extremely hard on both the body and mind. In fact, you may ask yourself, &quot;Why am I murdering myself like this? Year after year?&quot; Well, the author doesn't want to disillusion you of your beliefs. But the more you relax, the faster you can work. And the better your work is. You will learn about the three mainstays of Skillful Means (&quot;upaya&quot; in Tibetan): awareness, concentration, and and energy or ACE in &quot;Mastering Successful Work&quot;. This book is your primer and you will be advised to study it before you attack the next book. According to Tarthang Tulku, the mind is like the lens in a camera. These three factors need to be adjusted according to the work that you are doing. If you are trying to put a thread through a needle, your &quot;C&quot; (concentration) must increase incredibly while your awareness and energy must decline. If someone is talking to you at the same time, your &quot;awareness&quot; must increase thus making sure that you can not put the thread though the eye of the needle! Try it! They don't teach us any of this in school or college. Which is a real misery. Buy these two volumes and learn how to &quot;focus&quot; your camera properly. This can be your meditation. Good Luck.a properly. This can be your meditation. Good Luck.	2000-11-19

More psychiatrists recommend this book to their clients<br />than any other. It is also the bestselling book on psychology or<br />psychiatry that exists! Instead of writing another review on this<br />book, I decided to &quot;Do It&quot; so to speak. If this review can<br />help anybody, than it was worth the writing.<br />In the forward, Burns<br />talks in detail about a comprehensive study that was made on this<br />book. This is in the 1999 forward. Eighty people were given this book<br />to read in twenty-eight days. 70% recovered from a major depressive<br />episode from just reading this book in that time. The exercises were<br />optional. Before you order this book, Burns does stipulate that if you<br />have even had &quot;moderate depression&quot; for several weeks, than<br />you will need professional help in order to help you get through the<br />program. Also, any suicidal thoughts or tendencies. I am fortunate. I<br />took the BDC on page 20 and scored 58. Now, this is &quot;severe<br />depression&quot;. The BDC is the &quot;Burns Depression<br />Checklist&quot;. I have also been diagnosed as having a &quot;Major<br />Depressive Disorder&quot; by many psychiatrists. But I have help. Both<br />a therapist and a psychiatrist. So intead of just writing yet one more<br />review based on my opinions, why not do the program and pass on the<br />results? I e-mailed a daily report to my friend and follow Amazon.com<br />reviewer, Edgar Bridges. I began both reading and doing the exercises<br />on October 12th, 2000. I scored a 55 on the BDC one week after<br />starting the program. This is still &quot;severe&quot; depression. Two<br />weeks after starting, I got a 35 on the BDC!!! This is &quot;moderate<br />depression&quot;. Yes. I was very happy. But more suprised than<br />happy. A little bit shocked. That is the good news. After the third<br />week, I scored a 54. Bad news. I finished the entire program yesterday<br />and I scored a 56. A 3% decrease in depression. I did the &quot;triple<br />column&quot; technique everyday for twenty-eight days straight. I did<br />two of the &quot;anti-procrastination&quot; techniques as well for 14<br />days. I had memorized the ten distortions entirely and used them daily<br />when they arose. So it failed. I am sorry to say. But it might work<br />for you. After going to only one Alcoholics Anonymous meeting during<br />this time, my score dropped the next day to 35! Then in several days,<br />it was back up again to &quot;severe depression&quot;. Why? I took the<br />BDC everyday and examined the score for the days after I talked to<br />people and got outside and so forth. No decrease in the score.

This is simply a superb book. What I hope will become a classic. Lama Surya Das manages to make a complex subject very simple, while maintaining the innate complexity of the subject matter. Further, he manages to take Buudhism and exposes it in the light of our everyday life. It's as if he, in each chapter, manages to exemplify what he is trying to help us understand - he gives us domestic examples so that we can &quot;see&quot; Buddhism in everything that we do! In this book, he is like a teacher who is  explaining fractions to us. But he does so by cutting an apple into halves and quarters. Then he has us eat the apple! It is nearly imossible for us not to understand. The eight-fold path, which is the heart of Buddhism, is mapped out so beautifully this way that it is the best explanation I have ever heard or read.  One step flows into the other. After seeing how this can be applied in our daily life...No, strike that. After seeing how this is already applied in our daily life, we come to a full understanding. There are many exercises, meditation and otherwise, that help us to experience what the author is stating. Although the entire framework is Buddhist - everything fits into his explanations: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism. Our mundane activities as well as our highest aspirations. I can not see how anybody could not profit deeply in their life from reading this simply wonderful book.	2000-10-19

He beautifully describes the principles and the results of Libertarianism. Freedom. Chapter by chapter, we see the truth unfold in front of our eyes. In Tibetan Buddhism, &quot;generous acts&quot; lead to wealth. Sexual restraint leads to an established social order which reduces pollution. Stealing results in poverty. Lying results in confusion and mistrust. Taking intoxicants leads to a dulling of the mind. Honesty results in clear communication. The abscence of anger and hatred and enmity toward others leads to a long life and good health (which science is now proving). But as Harry points out in this book, when the government steps in - our freedom dwindles. The element of choice becomes mute. George Washington stated that government was a monster. Now why? Because it steps in and destroys your freedom of choice. It confiscates your generosity. It regulates your honesty (either toward lying or truth). As Harry points out, government is a &quot;coercive element&quot;. It's not a matter of letting people starve. It's not a matter of selfishness. It's not a matter of worshipping money. It's the choice for you and I to be able to make decisions freely that will further our welfare on dissipate it. If you yell at people, your income will go down. If you lie, you will lose your good friends. If you continually get drunk, you will lose your job. If you steal, people will not invite you over for dinner! This is the &quot;feedback&quot; that nature gives us. This is how we learn.  And our learning is measured by our income. Browne takes you, chapter-by-chapter, and explains why government action fails. It fails because it is coercive. It forces people to make moral decisions through the threat of violence. The greater degree of socialism, the more isolated we become from our neighbors.  It's the governments job to do this. It's the goverments job to do that. The more government, the more we are seperated.<br />And the wider the seperation, the more opportunity the government has to step in and run our lives even more. It's a non-ending process. The checks and balances of moral and ethical behavior are destroyed. And the ability to choose our own ethical and moral decisions is what the Founding Fathers meant by freedom. Take that away, and we only have stagnation. No growth. There is no growth when there is no choice.<br />Buy this book for yourself, your children, and your friends.

We all understand cause-and-effect. If we hit our thumb with a hammer, it will hurt. If we get drunk, we will have a hangover. But these &quot;correlations&quot;, as the author calls them, also expand to include &quot;positive effects&quot;. If you feed a dog, it will respond to you. If you hug your wife sincerely, you will have a more loving relationship. Everything that you are experiencing now is the result of past actions and thoughts. Millions of past actions and thoughts. Negative actions bring negative results. Positive actions bring positive results. Everything, literally everything, is the result of cause and effect. As the author states, &quot;There are no limited resources&quot;. And as the Dalai Lama states, &quot;We are all sharing the same karmic experience&quot;. In other words, we are here now because we all share similar effects of our actions. It does not matter if it is fair. It does not matter if it is right. It just is. If you drop the hammer on your toe - your toe will become swollen. If you don't soak your toe, it may develop an infection. If you don't take care of the infection, it may spread. Eventually, maybe your leg will have to be amputated. NOTE! This is what the author is stating when he says that karma (actions) are expandable. They expand unless erased. That is the bad news. Positive actions are expandable as well. There is cause-and-effect. And there is the law (just observe) that deeds expand if not attended to. Just put some meat out on your kitchen table for days. It becomes more and more rotten as time passes. First flies. And then all sort of bugs. Fungus. Actions are expandable if not taken care of.<br />What the author calls &quot;acts of generosity&quot; lead to wealth. And these acts too are expandable. Just like the meat on your kitchen table. Our actions and thoughts make &quot;imprints&quot; on our minds. It doesn't need to be fair. According to the author, when we understand the &quot;hidden potential&quot; of things (everything is really a blank screen) and that we can actually imprint our own minds to deliver certain results, just like I am typing on this keyboard, then we understand true creation. And the &quot;imprinting process&quot; goes much deeper by understanding the process of creation. &quot;Acts of generosity&quot; grow in the subconcious. And they eventually will ripen. This book needs to be read several times in order to understand this process. &quot;Acts of stealing (including cheating on your taxes)&quot; are imprinted in the subconcious and grow.

I loved this book when I read it. And Thay's (his nickname) books are  always good. But a split comes. Allow me to exemplify. I was being taught  by a Tibetan Lama who was a direct disciple of Kalu Rinpoche. When he asked  me what practice I was doing, I replied &quot;Kum Nye&quot; ( a form of  Nyingma meditation). He asked me why. I said because it seems to work best  for ME. He looked up at the ceiling and said, &quot;I wish all my students  did this!&quot; Each practice is just that. A practice. This book is simply  wonderful FROM ONE MAN'S VIEW when it covers dharma. The book covers the  eight absorption states (concentrative states) as well as the Twelve Links  of Independent Co-Arising. But when Thay starts to describe minfulness in  this book along and next to Buddhist Psychology, I feel that he over-steps.  When one tries to be mindful when one is tense, it can become a sharp  concentrative state where the attention is very focused and strained. The  lens need to be adjusted between minfulness and concentration and  relaxation. Despite what Thay says, you CAN wash the dishes  while thinking  about Batman. You CAN walk while thinking about Mel Gibson or Pamela  Anderson. A station of space has to be created between the observer and the  observed. In the two major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, mindfulness is  grounded in sitting. Then we emerge this sitting, very softly, into daily  life activities. Thay is a Vietnamese teacher. This type of  teaching is  strong influenced by the Theravada Tradition and the Mahayana Tradition  both. Zen is a bit &quot;tight assed&quot; unless you are drawn to it  naturally. My only real criticism is that meditative instructions are  explained in an absolute manner (this is Thay's opinion - one man's) and  mixed with Buddhist Psychology. They are very different. And,  unfortunately, the author speaks from a viewpoint that his opinion is the  opinion. Knowing that I will probably get 1,000 negative votes for stating  this, I will continue. When the author states that unless you are mindful  of washing the dishes, there is no merit accumulated, this is his opinion.  The very intent to do good brings the accumulation of merit in Tibetan  Buddhism. And one can't really wash the dishes without having SOME  mindfulness involved. One can look at an enemy and see them as a  Boddhisattva, therefore healing the animosity involved. If &quot;the  Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; written by Thay REALLY helped you to come  alive, then listen to what the Tibetans call &quot;The Inner Guru&quot;.  Follow YOUR heart. If it did, then BUY THIS BOOK. If it did not, then DON'T  BUY THIS BOOK. The author should have written a book on Buddhist Psychology  leaving out the absolutes of his teachings. Thank you.ill continue. When the author states that unless you are mindful  of washing the dishes, there is no merit accumulated, this is his opinion.

Excuse me (this book is on order!!!). Okay. I'm alright now. This is a  wonderful guide into the intricacies of Buddhist Psychology AND practice.  I've read it three times. It simplifies a complex subject extremely well.  With flow charts that are easy to comprehend, this is a Dr. Seuss guide to  all of Buddhist Psychology. You will never have to bow down to a teacher or  therapist again! This book enabled me to argue with teachers and  therapists. It's even great for impressing your boyfriend or girlfriend.  Simply said, you will know more about the mind after reading this book than  all the &quot;pop psychology&quot; dharma books put together. And it is  easy to understand. Fryba is an outstanding therapist who became a Buddhist  monk in Sri Lanka. The book will teach you basic meditative techniques.  Great! So do all the others. But this dharma book will show you  WHY you  are mediating. When you are mindful or comprehend the very processes that  you are now doing, they will not contain<br />greed, anger, or delusion. You  get angry, you are aware of it without YOU reacting, and it eventually goes  down the bathtub. There will now be no more of this in your body/mind. The  burning of greed (desire), the burning of aversion (anger and fear), or  delusion (closing your eyes to what is happening). This book makes the WHY  of your meditation practice come alive! I think you are a jerk, frankly.  Now take my remark about you and do something. That will create more  dislike for me. Or close your eyes to my remark. Or think that it is honest  which will create more grasping or like. But if you read my sentence, and  the anger is felt or comprehended, and it passes - you will go to sleep  with a little less tension because you have lost some  &quot;psychological&quot; weight. You now have less attachment whether it  be desire or aversion. Feel and let go. Feel and let go. Please buy this  book so you can help others. Thank you.	2000-09-09

The Abhidharma consists of  three  &quot;heaps&quot;. One is Psychology. Trungpa was at his very best when  this book recorded some of his lectures. And it is &quot;greatly&quot;  underrated. He covers pieces of the Abhidharma like a wizard. Each lecture  is followed by a question and answer period. So it's really great. One  question was what people who were really nuts could do for their pain.  Trungpa replied that getting anchored in the body, at what he calls  &quot;the animal realm&quot;, will help greatly. Years after reading this,  I was leading a  Codependents Anonymous meeting. One lady had just been  diagnosed as a manic-depressive (no, this is not &quot;nuts&quot;). When my  turn came, I suggested that anybody who is zippering off into outer space  would usually benifit by manual labor. Such as doing the laundry or washing  the dishes. When her turn came again, she said that was exactly what she  was going to do (crosstalk is not allowed). I learned this from Trungpa. He  also was very much against labeling people this-or-that. In this book, when  he was forced by the audience to speak about insanity, he did so in a way  that made it sound like insane people were egomaniacs like the rest of us.  But so much so that they &quot;spin off&quot;. He describes the two forms  in which he believed this happens. I have not looked at this book in 15  years. But it is very good. Perhaps Trungpa's most concise work ever.  Please buy it and read it. It really strikes deep into the heart of  Buddhist Psychology. Thank you.	2000-09-09
US	51736210	R2JIG1NB7V18VL	0385483325	429120523	Facing Death and Finding Hope: A Guide to the Emotional and Spiritual Care of the Dying	Books	5	21	35	N	N	Perhaps the most genuinely helpful book around...	Who are the people suffering the most? The dying. And you and I will die.  Our loved ones will die. And as Christine so brillantly points out, we  still have a connection after our loved one's death. My cousin Pat is a  virtual saint. She works with people who are dying. She is both a research  scientist and a nurse. She has learned to put up with what we pour out when  we are dying. Remember a time when you lost something that you very much  wanted? The anger? Well, imagine the atomic bomb of rage that goes off when  someone is apparently losing everything? I know! The body just drops off  and the soul lives on. But the delusion of dying IS the same as death. Do  you see what I mean? Unless we obtain a very advanced degree of spiritual  understanding, you and I will feel that we are dying. We could also define  death as the dropping off of the body. But since we so incredibly identify  with our bodies, to us, when the body is dying - we are dying.<br />So let's  take an agnostic's viewpoint on death. I think that is fair. As an  agnostic, we can ask, &quot;Is there life after death?&quot; And the answer  for an agnostic must be &quot;I don't know&quot;. If you have read or  studied &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot; by Sogyal Rinpoch  (Longaker's teacher) you will have covered your bases, so to speak. And  that and this book will help you with the dying, the dead, and the people  who have died a long time ago. So it's a very pragmatic thing to do. Study  what we know about death before it springs on us. Let us cover the book  briefly.<br />PART 1: THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING AND DYING<br />  This is a  basic run-down about death. Don't worry. It's  easy reading and  gives us our first glmpse of what is  essential. First, a good life  (that leaves out me!)  Secondly, that the thought at death is very  important.<br />PART 2: THE FOUR TASKS OF LIVING AND DYING  This is the main part of the book. This is the deep  existentential  part of the book. As ET said, &quot;Be Good.&quot;  But it's better  for ET to have said, &quot;Be good, especially  when you are  dying.&quot; Longaker gives you a tour through  the process (see  &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot;  which goes  through this more extensively).<br />PART 3: Advice for Caregivers, Parents,  and Survivors<br />  This part is especially good for the person who has  just  had a loved one pass away.<br />EPILOGUE<br />  Just  that.<br />Now someone may have a loved one who just died or who is dying. The  question may arise, &quot;What can I do?&quot; Order this book and the one  I referred to just recently. But I'll give you something now until your  books arrive. Be natural. Be you. Don't playact.  You might even tell the  person (calmly) that you're pissed off because they are dying! Isn't that  what you would want me to do? Just don't start yelling. Okay? After the  person has left their body, pray for them. For most of us, the Bible is the  best. Longaker might disagree with me. Whatever they were brought up with.  Torah, Koran, whatever. If they are a firm athiest, read them Bertrand  Russel. No. Still do the Bible because they will see some action soon. THE  HEARING GOES THE LAST. So don't be an idiot and start blabbing how gooey  they look. I do know that the most important thing is for them to pray  after they get out of the body. Be a chum. But not because the are DYING.  But imagine your friend going down a deep dark tunnel alone? Read the  books. Or at least this one. It's not really not my cup of tea. BUY THE  BOOK. I like whiskey and women. Good Luck.p          existentential  part of the book.

First of all, the book is way too long. Secondly, you begin  to wonder where the author gets all these ideas! He has some sort of  &quot;germ theory&quot; about the human race. I don't mean genetics. But  his complete obsession with the Jews. He creates a road map where the Jews  step in and take over a country. Then they make friends with everybody. And  then they begin to acquire the country that they habitate. The big question  is, &quot;Where did this gentleman get his facts?&quot; He seems to have  made it all up in his head without any basis of fact except for perhaps his  own life experiences. He comes up with some good ideas. Such as increased  physical education in the school systems. And also increased courage and  will power. But he just falls to  pieces periodically. All of his ideas.  They don't come together into any coherent whole. He goes into such  incredible details about how the Jew takes over. a), b), c), and so forth.  But he literally gives no concrete examples. It's as if he is living out a  comic book. Worse yet, it's as if he created the comic book. And after  awhile, it is (need I say it) just plain boring. Don't buy it unless you  want to get terribly confused without any purpose (Note: Written with the  sole purpose of how this book review would appear if I knew nothing about  the Holocaust - it is boring and ridiculous - only buy it if you are an  historian. It's better to read about Hitler than to read Hitler obviously).	2000-09-08

It's a good read, but it is too short. The whole underlying theory to  socialism/communism is that when there is no private ownership, people are  happier and will no longer steal or kill. I'm a registered Republican. I  read a book by them (I bought it and read it but I forget the title!) and  they proposed in 1995 that we simply have a 17% income tax across the board  except for the poverty level. It would be something like sending in a post  card without all the beauracacy. You know. &quot;Now add 17a to 17b and  then figure the true meaning of pie or 3.14). So Republicans only believe  in the first few pages of this book. Democrats are a little higher on the  &quot;Commie Level&quot;. About 30 or 40%. The Libertarians are about 3%  Communistic (the presidential candidate wants to let welfare be for 9  months and install a  missle system with YOUR money)! Let's hear the boo's.  The only pure &quot;anti-commie&quot; is an Anarchist Libertarian. So read  this book and try to understand why 99% of the population are Communists  (but they are afraid to say). I still might vote for Gore or Browne or  Nader or Bush. I am sure that my vote shall mean a great deal in how it all  turns out this November.	2000-09-08

This is the sequel to &quot;Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism&quot;.  Are you gay? Are you a crossdresser? Do you cheat on your taxes? Did you  hit one of your children? The point of Trungpa's teaching seems to hammer  agin and again at the main human condition. That we are afraid of being  human. We are &quot;embarassed&quot; at being human. One woman was reported  as having choked to death in a restuarant. Why? Because she was too  embarrassed to cough! Through his behavior and his teachings, Trungpa kept  hammering this message home at his students. &quot;The Myth of  Freedom&quot; takes us from the beginning of the Hinayana Journey (in the  Tibetan sense, not to put down Theravada Buddhism which is also called  'Hinayana') all the way to the Vajrayana teachings where there is direct  transmission from the Spiritual Guide. Trungpa goes through the  technicalities, but you must remember that these are lectures to his  students. I shared the same block as Trungpa. He was giving a lecture in LA  in December 1980. I was too embarrassed to go inside. I might stammer when  I met him. I might &quot;goof up&quot; (as he called it). Maybe I would say  something &quot;stupid&quot;. I was embarrased. I was embarrassed until his  teachings sank in. Then I began to loosen up. Unfortanately, I went back to  my &quot;cocoon&quot;, as he called it. I've read this book three times.  You will love it! Just don't balk when you read other books on Tibetan  Buddhism where there are very many rules. The message of Trungpa was  &quot;Stop being embarrased about yourself!&quot;. And he showed this  example by indulging in the worst behavior imaginable. But, yes, you can  sneeze in front of a group of people. You can leave your zipper down  accidentally if you are a male. Or don't put on a bra if you are a female  and then find that you clearly &quot;see&quot; through while you give a  lecture! According to Trungpa, it this embarrassment which he referred to  as &quot;negative negativity&quot;. He pounces on this concept throughout  this book and his others. Negativity is alright in itself. I get angry. But  then I am embarrassed for BEING angry. So I gulp it down or explode. If we  accept the basic negativity, feel it, then this is negativity. But if we  shame ourselves for having it - then this manufactures even more anger or  Negative Negativity. Which can eventually result in being a mass murderer.  Everything is being projected outside on the world. You are not  &quot;eating your past&quot; so to speak. This is the message of the book.  BUY IY! And buy &quot;Spiritual Materialism&quot;. Thannk you (mispelling  intentional).ivity&quot;. He pounces on this concept throughout  this book and his others. Negativity is alright in itself. I get angry.

This is the first book I read of Trungpa's. This is the first time that I  discovered that there was a &quot;Chogyam Trungpa&quot;. I greedily took it  home from the Bodhi Tree, read it, and then grimaced as I realized that you  needed a teacher (not so today!). So I took some Valium and went into the  Dharmadhatu Center in L.A. and received meditation instruction. This was  1977 so it was  a brave deed. And since I had no feeling in my brain or  body, I did quite well. A brunette sat down with me and taught me about the  famous &quot;outbreath&quot;. Chogyam Trungpa was officially my  &quot;teacher&quot;. Later, I would find out that he was an outrageous  madman (no slander, Amazon.com. Even his present students admit this!) The  book is a brillant way to begin to &quot;read up&quot; on Trungpa. It's a  soft blow. It will give good insight into Trungpa's teachings. But this  series of lectures were given in Scottland in 1968, I believe. Trungpa  wouldn't hit his stride until years later. After reading this, read  &quot;Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism&quot; and &quot;The Myth of  Freedom&quot;. The title is a bit misleading. In the Kagyu (just say  &quot;cog-you&quot; and you will get away with it) Tradition of Tibetan  Buddhism, they more or less depend on sitting meditation to trigger off  mindfulness. As one student told me, &quot;They sit like pigs&quot;. They  have been criticized by the other three Tibetan traditions for it.  So if  you are buying this book from Amazon.com because of the title  &quot;Meditation in Action&quot; - forget it. Buy &quot;The Miracle of  Minfulness&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh and vote for my review as you examine  it! But if you are buying this book as an introduction to Trungpa's  brillant teachings, then BUY THIS BOOK! Thank you.	2000-09-07

We have this new thing going on in the world. I believe it is called  &quot;technology&quot;. I have a joke for the reviewer. What do you have  with a family who is making $50,000 a year but has no hired help? Can't  guess? You have a very stupid family. You may not find this joke funny now.  But you will after buying this book from Amazon.com.  Also buy copies for  your friends and neighbors to prove how stupid you were. Actually, we all  freeze at the idea of &quot;hired help&quot;. What happens if they<br />steal  from us? What happens if our housekeeper just got out of jail for child  molestation? I have to get quite serious here. These questions do tax the  mind. And it does make outside help nearly impossible except for  multi-millionaires. What about employment forms? Will you get sued if your  housekeeper brakes his or her leg? And, don't deny it, &quot;What will  people think!&quot; There isn't much time today for couples. I have asked  many of them how they feel about having gotten married and having a family.  Nearly all of them liked having been married! Even for 50 years. Then ask  them about the children. If they do say yes, you will see a grimace and a  pained look in the eyes. Try it! There is one pragmatic approach to saving  the family nowadays. Hire a housekeeper. But this is really too much for  most people. It's very complicated. Let me change that last sentence. It's  very complicated if you don't have this book. The author covers everything!  She makes in incredibly simple. There is only one main problem with the  book. And this is not covered in detail. When you do have a housekeeper,  you may see that all those ex-wives and ex-husbands did not need to be  gotten rid of. Totally unnecessary! All you needed was extra time to pay  attention to each other. In other words, all you needed was a housekeeper!  Well, the book wasn't out then. BUT IT IS NOW. You need to stroke your  partner daily. And if you don't have much time to do so, then they won't  get stroked, will they? BUY THE BOOK. It is mucher cheaper than a divorce.

The NAEH is a marvelous organiztion for helping the homeless. I downloaded  a survival guide from the NAEH. It's incredible! But let's review this  book. It is just wonderful! And costly! And I paid $35! You can order it  from Amazon.com for only $28. The proceeds go to the National Alliance for  Ending Homelessness. There seems to be some misunderstanding about the  homeless. And  this book has a tinge of that. But it is not as bad as some  books on homelessness which deal with the subject. One has to be homeless  to really understand. One suffers from what I call the &quot;pyramid  effect&quot;. This applies to all the poor. And especially the blacks. When  you are homeless, your fear is exponential. Simply said, the less your  resources, the more your fear will expand. Just imagine a pyramid. Now go  down that axis from the center, and you will see that fear expands the more  your resources dwindle. Some symtoms that I experienced were the frequent  need to urinate. Putting my forefinger down my throat so that I could  vomit. This seems to give some release to the fear. One needs to rent a  storage bin. This will give one access to a washroom. But one should also  &quot;mark&quot; a fast food restuarant for cleaning as well. And you have  to keep clean. The NAEH hammers away at this. I am glad the proceeds from  this book are going to them. A job? I think I tried for 20 or 30 jobs  during this period. And I actually worked! One needs to go through thrift  stores and get the feel for buying. A lot of the homeless that I met seem  to be women whose spouse died and they simply didn't know how to handle  money. I knew one who went insane. I also found that my sexual desire and  my craving for junk foods went WAY up! This is to escape the present  moment. One of my homeless friends went to prostitutes, got AIDS, and that  was it for him. I don't know where he ended up! He just dissapeared. And  you have to forget the jobs after awhile. I had a beautiful sports jacket,  black dress shoes, nice slacks, hair cut short, and a dummy resume that I  had written at the library. But the interviewers can always sense when you  are scared. Which you are all the time when you are homeless! I remember  their seeing my eyes filled with tension and fear. That's it. Out you go.  And it is something you can't fake (your level of fear) unless you take  drugs first. Which are deadly. But I did get a job for $4.25 an hour. The  money just dissapeared it was so little. The manager kept jumping on me. I  yelled back and quit. Getting an &quot;entry level&quot; job while being  homeless is much like diving into a barrel of water from 1,000 feet above.  The chances are not very good. This book exemplifies an attempt to get at  the root cause of homelessness with words and pictures. It suceeds,  somewhat. My symtoms started to dissapear when my homelessness ended over  three years ago. But three still remain. 1) I don't want any posessions. I  might lose them. 2) I don't trust anybody. 3) I don't want to owe anybody  anything. It complicates matters. This is a wonderful book. BUY IT! Oh.  Vote for Al Gore.

The one major flaw of this book is that these 17 lies are so ingrained  into our minds that we really might have to re-read this book over and over  again. Chandler's view is that it is ACTION that moves us ahead in life!  Not philosophy and strategies. His approach is to destroy all our  destructive conditioning in order to let the light, which has always been  there, to shine. This book will not be good for self-help book sales. For  the premise is that we already have everything that we need.<br />So I will go  alone on a deserted island and let us see how I do. Well, nice trees. But  nobody is here. &quot;I am Helpless!&quot; Lie #17. And IF I believe this  lie, I will die. Okay, I'll look for something to eat. Maybe a mango tree.  But I can't climb up a mango tree like a kid anymore. &quot;I'm too old for  that!&quot; Lie no. 3. And if I believe this lie I will die. I crawl up the  mango tree and acquire some delicious mangoes. After eating them, I wonder  if they are poisonous. Who cares? &quot;What Doesn't Kill Me Makes Me  Stronger!&quot; Lie #16. Yes. And if you see a lion, Bill,  just tell  yourself the same thing. You will make a great meal. &quot;Oh, well. I'm  sadder now but wiser&quot; Lie #8. Chandler states quite accurately that  being wiser should make you happier. I wish I could gather some firewood.  &quot;But I Can't Because I'm afraid.&quot; Lie #4. Give me a break, Bill.  If you saw a lion, you would break all Olympic records for running AND be  afraid. Chandler talks about how the courage is there in all of us. We just  have to stop denying it's existence. But fear IS a bad habit of the mind.  &quot;And the longer I have a habit, the harder it is to break.&quot; Lie  #9. Bill, just walk over and find some wood.  A habit can be changed in an  instant. Just make up your mind and put action into place. I would have to  write a book to complete this scenerio. And what the author is stating is  very true. But there is one subject he does not touch upon. SALES. When  people believe these lies, they will take more pills, have more visits to  the doctor, seek outside services rather than doing something themselves,  finding a psychologist to raise their &quot;self-esteem&quot; (lie #13),  getting breast implants because &quot;there is something wrong with  me&quot; lie #2, buying diaries and journals - spending tons of money  remembering the past - going on expensive vacations so you can CAPTURE the  past for later (It's a Shame That We Didn't Catch That on Video! Lie #14),  waiting for more money so that you WILL be happy. (Winning the Lottery  Would Solve Everything! Lie #11). I may have missed a couple lies. I  apologize. But that's just the way I am. (lie #15). BUY THIS BOOK!  Especially, BUY IT FOR YOUR KIDS. Healthy people, both mentally and  physically, are active people. Psychotherapy and spiritual beliefs may just  &quot;befuddle&quot; you and enable you to lie down and watch TV. Get a  good diagnosis from a doctor or a psychiatrist, and you really have it  made!

Trungpa lets loose with his cannon in this book. Christianity, Islam, and  Judiasm are totally false because they are &quot;eternalists&quot;. They  believe in a permanent soul that just goes on and on and on. Hindus are  eternalists. Theravada Buddhists are what Trungpa calls &quot;atomistic  eternalists&quot;. They don't realize that an ant sees a flower as a  jungle. Or a spot of dirt as a mountain. The obsever of phenomena is left  out. Enlightenment consists of a Self observing impermanence, suffering,  and selflessness. The Self is indicated from the fact that the observer is  not dealt with. And there is no observer. So Trungpa states that  &quot;atomistic materialists&quot; are &quot;half right&quot;. Zen speaks  of a Big Mind. There is no &quot;Big Mind&quot;. And he isn't done with us  yet. The spiritual path is horrible! All pain. My collecting of spiritual  teachers is called &quot;Spiritual Materialism&quot;. My examaning  self-help books AND doing reviews on them is called &quot;psychological  materialsim&quot;. The last is &quot;Physical Materialism&quot;. And  Trungpa seems to indicate that this last form of materialism is the least  harmful! He states that the Guru will cut through your suit of armor. He  will keep at you until you are exposed naked. You will try and struggle to  keep your armor intact. But the Guru will see  your pretense and expose  whatever you are hiding. He will strip you clean of all three forms of  materialism. WOW! Please remember that this book is composed of his  lectures to his students.  It is simply brillant beyond belief in it's  ability to destroy illogical assumptions made by people. It is a classic.  Trungpa always had a way of examining the American Mind and striking at our  delusions. It is a great read. Like seeing us all excited about our  spiritual journey and kicking here and there until we fall. A must read.  Buy it and read it three times like I did. Trunpa always cuts. See what you  can do with this book. Thank you.hank you.	2000-09-05

I have the CD's for &quot;How to  Stop Worrying and Start Living&quot;. I've read this book three times. I  just can't do it anymore. It's dishonest. Carnegie would tell me that  praise IS honest if you just focus your compliment on something true. Like  telling a woman that she has beautiful eyes when she is also nasty and  mean. Or telling your friend that he has a great sense of humor when he is  demonical and selfish. The Tibetan Buddhists state that &quot;Praise  Kills&quot;. This means that you will create massive  &quot;attachments&quot; to people. This may be good in sales or politics.  But it is very subtlely manipulative. I know that the person who is reading  this is highly intelligent. Otherwise, why would they be reading a review  on Amazon.com? And most of the people who read these reviews seem to have  great insight into human nature. And I feel bad about criticizing this  book.

It goes so fast! I thought Barry Sears and &quot;The Zone&quot; was the  most healthy diet. Now I turn around and we have this diet! Just go with  the flow. Right? Let's write a review. We all have a pancreas. This organ  secreates insulin in order to destroy excess sugar in the bloodstream.  Sugar is what keeps our motor running. If it is at a steady level in our  bloodstream. The diabetic's pancreas has quit! Therefore, excess sugar is  in the bloodstream. So they have to take insulin orally or through shots.  The authors (who are supported by Adrew Weil and Jean Carper) have found a  way of scientically measuring how fast a food will dissolve in your  bloodstream. Virtually all foods. This is the GI index. It is based on the  premise that the more balanced your sugar level is, the better your health  will be. The authors state that this is a Godsend for diabetics. But that  virtually everyone should follow this diet. They state &quot;Be kind to  your pancreas!&quot; You see, eating high GI foods (sugar that dissolvces  real fast) causes your pancreas to say &quot;Hold on! Secrete insulin! We  are flooded with sugar!&quot; Eat High GI foods with Low GI foods, and your  pancreas will say, &quot;On the Alert. Secrete a bit of insulin. No  emergency.&quot; I'll bet that the reader can't even guess what high GI  foods are. You would not believe it! Rye Bread is High GI (believe it or  not). But a candy bar and a hamburger is okay! Before you buy the book in  haste, I must state that the authors do give limits. Less than 50 grams  daily of fat. And at least 200 grams of Carbohydrates. So, you decide. And  a diabetic can even eat sugar. My mother has had Diabetes 1 for 51 years. I  asked her if she wanted a Snickers candy bar. She looked at me like I was  crazy! I have decided YES. For myself and my mother's meals. Not  &quot;punching&quot; the pancreas makes sense. Without this book, your  sugar level will look like a &quot;rollar coaster&quot;. But you decide.  Your health is much too important to base on these reviews. Buy the book  and make a decision. Good luck and I wish you good health.	2000-09-05

I once stated that the further you get away from AA, the worse the  12-steps are in new groups (CoDA, OA, and so on). This book and this  organization were created for people with psychiatric illnesses who have  chemical or alcohol abuse at the same time. I told my therapist more than  once, &quot;Look it. I do NOT want to be in a group with crazy people who  have heroin needles hanging from their arms!&quot; He replied mildly,  &quot;I don't think that will happen.&quot; Just the opposite happened!  There WERE schizophrenics and hard drug users (especially cocaine)there.  But they were REALLY nice, well-dressed, and honest. Wonderful people.  These were DRA people. And this book is our handbook. DRA believes that the  BIG BLUE book of AA states that it is alright to take psychiatric  medication. I don't know about that. But  this book is a gem. It states the  entire format of DRA. Maybe I shouldn't say this. But just between you and  me, the members of DRA seem to be members of AA as well. I'm doing both. I  have been 101 days without alcohol. How did I do it? My psychiatrist looked  me straight in the eye and told me that the combination of Valium (I'm a  Valium addict) and booze will turn my brain into mush. I REALLY hate him.  But he may have helped me more than anyone. He suggested DRA. So did my  therapist. But I fell for the cognitive therapy bit so much (SMART, RR. and  so many other &quot;test tube&quot; semanticists). My psyciatrist said that  I'm an &quot;alche who takes 'goof balls'&quot;. And that he would quit on  me if I drank again. This book and the Big Blue Book are absoluely  essential for people who have psychiatric disorders (I have major  depression) and chemical dependency. Don't go the Albert Ellis and Jack  Trimpey route. Thinking doesn't cause one to be depressed or to drink. It  can be the death of a spose, trouble with one's job, or just a feeling of  hopelessness. Follow AA and DRA and get well. Avoid CBT and RET because  they sell. Thank you. And thank you Dr. Carraway. You were very tough. But  it did work. BUY THIS BOOK!nk you. And thank you Dr. Carraway.

This book is the foundation for all American Tibetan Buddhists. Are not we  all confused? Don't we try to make sense of all this. Imagine! An entire  world not connected with 1) Where they will be in 100 years from now 2)  Will we survive after our body passes away. Imagine that! It is the FIRST  thing that you would wonder about. If you were on a boat, certainly you  would ask &quot;Where am I going?&quot; Wouldn't you? According to Tibetan  Buddhism, this is a case of hysterical and mass repression. We DO care  about death. Very much so. But we just may not be aware of it. I am 49. I'm  getting old! I was worried about aging when I was 25. And so is everybody  else that I've ever known! It's sort of like being on the Titanic, knowing  that there is an iceberg ahead -  so instead of looking into this matter -  we all get together and talk as fast as we can and play pinball machines!  Isn't this true? This is a book about Living and Dying. We go to bed at  night. We tell ourselves that EVERYTHING will be beautiful in the future  (lying to ourselves but maintaining our sanity). Or tell ourselves that  really horrible things could happen tomorrow (like being pinned under a  car). The last scenerio is actually more realistic, but we become so  neurotic that we seek professional help! Then the psychiatrist tells us to  delude ourselves with &quot;wishful thinking&quot;! Plus a few pills and we  are all set. BUY THIS BOOK. You will learn so much. BUY IT if you are a  Christian, agnostic, Buddhist, Athiest, Scientologist, Hindu, Democrat, or  Republican.

I remember when I was a student at the Dharmadhatu Center of Los Angeles.  The rules were to simply meditate and that was it! The same with Hindu  Yoga. The same with all Eastern paths. Then I stumbled on this book. It was  wonderful. Did you know that you can put in as little as 10 minutes a day  of sitting meditation and then apply this mindfulness of breath to  &quot;washing the dishes&quot;? Later, apply mindfulness (being aware) to  taking a bath. To eating. Well, you will meditate now for 1 hour a day. In  fact,  Buddhist Masters state that minfulness in daily life is more  important than the actual sitting meditation! Buy this book and become a  16-hour a day meditator. Doing &quot;TV meditation&quot;,  &quot;conversation meditation&quot;, &quot;telephone meditation&quot;,  &quot;cooking meditation&quot;. you name it. Nhat Hanh gives a variety of  sitting meditations. Pick the one that feels right. Then do the meditation  in daily life. Right now, I am doing &quot;write a review meditation&quot;.

I had listened to  some Tibetan nun lecturing. That was fine. I was talking to the guy at the  desk. Asking him if I could only pay half on some seminar. It was a hassle.  Suddenly, I turned around. There was the Tibetan nun standing in the  doorway. She was looking at me with such intense love that I felt  embarrassed. Just open love beaming at me. I don't know if the reader has  ever felt that. Someone not loving YOU in a grasping way. But just total  love. From the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. I suddenly  turned away. It was a weird experience. Anyway, that was Pema Chodren. I  have bought these tapes. You will do something called &quot;Tonglen&quot;.  You will also do Shamatha Meditation. And have 59 Lojungs (items to  practice). I would like to simplify this if I may. You will learn a simple  breathing technique (Buy &quot;Start Where You Are&quot; by Pema Chodren  where she will tell you how to do this very simple technique of just  following your outbreath). Then Tonglen. Another very simple meditation  technique which you can also use during difficult times during the day. And  then the slogans. I would like to share with you my experience with one of  the slogans. &quot;Drive All Blames into One&quot;. In this slogan, your  focus is not on the person who is irritaing you, or the situation, but the  focus is switched to paying attention to your anger. No matter what the  situation. You are taking responsiblity for your emotions. Pema explains  how this will enable you to be even more assertive! Because the anger is  gone. You will eventually find yourself responding accurately to the person  or situation. No back-talking in one of the slogans. No putting others  down. It's a whole journey. I have only one question. Where will Bill  Butler go?	2000-09-05

It is marvelous. And my spaceship is taking off  on January first  (although I could start now). Just one point that I hope Amazon.com will  let through. The public gave my review of &quot;The Power of Positive  Thinking&quot; 0 out of 12 votes. Amazon.com is asking if a review is  &quot;helpful&quot; or not. I vote for reviews I don't like. They can be  helpful. Well, as a Christian, I am supposed to forgive you. Not easy. This  book is incredible! It will teach you how to be a REAL Christian like Jesus  taught. But you WILL have to buy &quot;The Daily Walk Bible&quot;. This is  WTB's bible (Walking Through The Bible - WTB). WTB, an organization to help  all of us to be better Christians, has designed a Bible to accomapany this  book.  Purists want the King James Version. But I read in WTB's Bible that  there have been many translations of the Bible through time! So don't  expect any &quot;Thy, Thee, and so forth&quot;. The syntax, though, is  pretty strict. Now let's get to the book. You have two choices after buying  BOTH books. Start your daily Bible reading NOW. On this day or tommorow.  Or, start on January first. You will be in Genesis if you wait. Take your  choice. Now this book gives you an outline of the Bible's history. The  historical comments and suggestions of the Bible are  said to be the heart  of the Bible. How God deals with His children through time. The translators  state this. Now this book is real Christianity. Suggestions of praying on  your knees! Keeping your room clean! Cooking! I am sure that I will be a  good Christian in one year. The book states that the Bible, in it's  application, depends on Order. And Order depends on Action. This book  really let's you have it! And they tie it in with the Bible. No. Premarital  sex is out! As is adultery. And I am very sorry for this, but homosexuality  is out. About premarital sex and homosexuality, the book states that the  Bible does have something to say about these subjects. This book leads you  into a Christian Life. They ask &quot;Do you hang around people because  they are well known?&quot; I mean, really tough. Like being in the Army.  And you will pray your brains out. I want to practice the Kagyu Buddhism as  outlined by Pema Chodren. But both the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist master,  Thich Nhat Hanh are hammering away to people that they have to go back to  their roots first. I was an Episcopalian when I was a child.  This<br />incredible book helps one to retrace their steps. Then you can do  what you want. But your roots will always be your first religion. Forsake  that and you forsake everything. This book will turn you upside down. You  will be asked to read a portion of the Bible daily. In Hosea 4 to 6, you  will be reminded that the ten commandents are the central core of your  religion. Do you follow them? They even provide a checklist! Then you read  your portion of the Bible for the day. Which is Hosea 4 to 6 I believe.  Very tough work.

Have you ever  thought of just letting it be? Not repress or analyze it. Make it into a  dark blue cloud. Feel it. Feel all of it. Now imagine a beautiful white  light. This may be your Higher Power (Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Santa Claus,  the Easter Bunny). Still feel the blue cloud. Feel it completely. And  BELIEVE TOTALLY that your Higher Power will send a white rain that will  disperse the blue cloud. BELIEVE IT! Another exercise is to remember what  good you have done in life. It is very hard to raise a child. Even badly.  Did you do it? Think how much giving that involved! Did you work at a 9 to  5 job for 6 years. Now that is REAL giving. It is. And it is very hard.  Monotonous and tedious. And YOU did it. It IS hard. How much have you  accomplished? Did you ever help anybody? Well, look at it. A lot of people  help nobody. See it as big as a movie screen. Stop getting in the gutter  with negative thinking. When you clean your house, you are getting rid of  all your negativities (depression, anger, anxiety). You are freeing  yourself! If you BELIEVE THIS, it will be true. Are you scared about an  upcoming event. Root canal? What an opportunity!. Just think. An  opportunity to have  REALLY good teeth! BUY this book. I am at the  confusion level with this book. The techniques do work. You can  &quot;feel&quot; a problem as a seperate obeject. Feel it. Then have your  Higher Power rain and dissolve it. And the pain is gone! Weird.  Auto-suggestion? Self-hypnosis? Tulku Thondup states that a &quot;positive  attitude&quot; is necessary to get through life. Isn't he right?lve it. And the pain is gone! Weird.  Auto-suggestion? Self-hypnosis? Tulku Thondup states that a &quot;positive  attitude&quot; is necessary to get through life. Isn't he right?	2000-09-05

Milton Friedman, who Harry is a great  admirer of, was asked about Harry Browne! I'll try my very best to report  his answer. Milton said that Harry had  great ideas. But they are not  &quot;feasible&quot; at this time. In this book, Harry does give us an  offer. But it may be an answer that we must refuse. Nevertheless, his work  is highly commendable. In fact, Friedman said that he was a Libertarian  with a small &quot;l&quot;. Buy the book though. Harry is paving the<br />way  for the future. For a time when we will not have to use centralized  violence. We can be kind to each other on a local level. Then on a  neighborly level. Harry's e-mail stated to me that America has always been  a generous country. I heard that 49% of the American population do civic  activities for others. And 78% give money. This outrates any other country  in the world! In fact, we are the most generous people in the world. As you  read each page, you will get a glimpse of future possibilities. And how  centralized power has caused mass destruction to the world in the past.	2000-09-05

Before you fall asleep tonight, please say over and over to yourself  silently &quot;I'm good at ConZentration&quot;, &quot;I'm good at  ConZentration&quot;...For 5 minutes. Every night. This is the crux of  Horn's program. But in order to do it right, you will simply have to buy  the book. Although psychonalysts from Eric Fromm to Fritz Pearls have  mentioned &quot;concentration&quot; as a way to health and success, the  subject has been more or less avoided it seems. This book will read in a  way that seems &quot;trite&quot;. She seems to quote everybody from Ronald  Reagan to Donald Duck! And there does seem to be a lot of Charles Atlas  &quot;hype&quot;. But don't put it down yet. Sogyal Rinpoche, a Tibetan  Buddhist master, recommends meditating a few minutes and then integrating  that period into your life. As does Tarthang Tulku who created the first  Tibetan monestary outside of Tibet. In fact, he states that concentration  is most beneficial when it is being applied in everyday life! Horn helps  you to do so. The 5 minutes is just the beginning. PRACTICE. But the 5  minutes will be necessary to put you in tune with what you are going to do  the next day. Don't think of it as a &quot;gimmick&quot;. It's not. If Horn  just left it at 5 minutes a night, I would be giving this review only one  star. As a  &quot;gimmick&quot; book. But Horn doesn't do this. She applies  what she calls ConZentration to daily activities and situations that can be  highly beneficial. It is very nice to see how Eastern Religion is meeting  the West. Give it a try. I'll do it right now. As I finish this review, I  am gathering my thoughts and focusing on my writing. I also did it in a  tunnel while walking. Give it a try if you find the Eastern Path a little  &quot;yucky&quot;. Did I say that? Good luck.	2000-08-09

For anybody who buys this  book, I would highly recommend this approach. Buy the book AND the tapes.  Ms. Richardson is a real and sincere lady. You will feel this as you work  the program. But it misses the point. Which is &quot;Self-Change&quot;.  This entire 7-step program is laid upon the first step or foundation and  builds from there. This is the first step of &quot;Extreme Self-Care&quot;.  Cheryl almost calls it selfishness, but she qualifies it strongly. Her view  is that you simply CAN'T help others unless you help yourself first. I  called a counselor at my church, Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogananda).  He stated that this was true. That when you give to yourself, you are  giving to others. So I went ahead. All clear. I usually, well, almost  always give too much of myself. About 10% to myself and 90% to others. A  Tibetan lama, Tarthang Tulku, recommends giving 75% to yourself at first  and then decreasing. The renowned psychologist, Albert Ellis, recommends  60/40. 60% to yourself always. Well, Cheryl, as my &quot;personal  coach&quot;, asked me in the book to read the entire program. That is, the  whole book. I did so but it was like being in a plane crash.  I increased  my self-consideration to 20%. That felt s-o-o-o-o good. 30% felt even  better. 50% was great and I highly recommend it. But this cutting off of  relationships is simply not healthy. You see, I am very intolerant. So I  cut off just about all my friends for being &quot;toxic&quot; and draining.  This is a very bad area you can get into! I began to say &quot;no&quot; to  too many people including my family. I even cut off my partner in the  program! I felt stiff and isolated. I was at 80% now and going into a  tailspin! Wouldn't it have been better to have dealt with my intolerance  than labeling all my relationships &quot;draining&quot;? I have to  recommend buying this book, though. I did not return Cheryl's book or her 4  tapes. Why? I'm at about 30% of &quot;extreme self-care&quot; right now. A  bit low. I want to push it up to about 50%. But for those of you who may  have problems with this program, please watch out for those &quot;higher  altitudes&quot;. You may come crashing down. Good luck.m at about 30% of &quot;extreme self-care&quot; right now. A  bit low. I want to push it up to about 50%.

On my own, I studied my two texts on algebra. I also took algebra in college. With the texts, I would have to finish 50 or so problems and then look in the back of the text. And by that time, I didn't care about the  problems that I had stumbled with! In college, it would take several days  before I knew the results of the math tests. This is not good learning!  This method does not provide immediate reinforcement. And you forget the  problems that you had stumbled with.<br />I've corresponded with a Dr. Osher  Doctorov. He is a math and physics teacher who has so many credentials that  it will make your head ache (see his comments on flash cards in his reviews  on mathematics). He is the one who turned me onto the idea of flash or  study cards.<br />One disagreement with Exambusters. The flash cards need to  be used during the math courses and be given top priority. Not just for  exams. But for the study of math in general. This is all based on learning  theory. One doesn't have to take an opinion about it. If B.F. Skinner used  immediate reinforcement on pidgeons and it worked, why do we assume that  pidgeons should be treated with more respect than our children or us? I  study algebra for relaxation (once I did so for 6 hours without stopping).  But Dr. Octorov believes that the torture used on not knowing an answer to  an equation that we have tumbled with can be a great pain. Or at least this  is his implication. He has taught all ages of students and take a look at  this reviewer's credentials! Do you and your kids a favor. Buy these flash  cards. And then test your children if you like! Make it a game! Also see my  review on Polya's book, &quot;How to Solve It!&quot;. Math is a question  mark. Not a period. Than you.	2000-07-20

Buy this book and simply get updated to  the new finacial world. As Kiyosaki brillantly points out, the really  important thing is to be able to fall back on investments. And this is of  the most utmost importance. As I read this book, I could see that Kiyosaki  can't really see into the future. But he does know the realities of our  situation today. In seems that more and more people are simply going to  live off their investments. If you acquire one million dollars and receive  10% interest, you will receive $100,000 before taxes yearly. Why are we  having our children going to college on a $50,000 loan without  understanding the realities that Kiyosaki espouses in this simply  &quot;must-buy-read-and-FOLLOW&quot; book. Save your children from falling  into the antiquated money trap that NO LONGER EXISTS. Kiyosaki also seems a  bit worried about the future where a two-class system exists. One in which  people are living off their investments. And another which consists of  people working for $6 an hour. Think of it. It is happening before our eyes  and seems more like a science fiction novel. But the book and save yourself  a great deal of possible future misery.	2000-06-19

Jeanette MacDonald was born in West Philadelphia on June 18th, 1903 with a brass spoon in her mouth. She was poor and had two elder sisters, 10 and 12 years older. In 1964, when she died, two former presidents attended her  funeral and two men who would later become presidents. In 1939, she was the  biggest female star in the world bar none. Directors and producers would  fall in-love with her. One after the other. They wanted to marry her! This  would happen over and over again. Including Louis B. Mayer. Turk does an  outstanding job of doing exhaustive research. Privy to her private memoirs  and correspondence. I've read 100 biographies of &quot;big shots&quot;. But  this one was incredible. On Broadway in the late twenties. A Sex Goddess in  the early thirties who self-admittedly stated that she spent more time  taking her clothes on and off during her films than acting. A Virgin  Goddess in the late Thirties. A 180 turnaround. She was extrordinarily  ambitious. Nothing could stop her. Yet she was extraordinarily kind and  generous to all alike. Unless...you took unfair advantage of her. I have  read the four-volume biography of Robert E. Lee. He was kind and tender  like MacDonald. And he was ambitious. But not he wasn't anywhere ambitious  like her. How these two traits, great ambition and great kindness can  reside in any human brain still remains a mystery to me after reading this  book. But that she was. She emanated Power and Kindness. Also great Virtue.  She just bulldozed her way through everything! I found this biography more  fascinating than those of FDR, Eisenhower, Marshall, Beckett, Churchill,  Patton, et all. But Turk gives it to us straight. I have never believed  that anybody could be like this. She would give you the shirt off her back.  She would do pranks. She would make fun. Extremely generous.  Yet...extremely hard-working to the point of unbelievability. Strong as a  brick house. Ambitious beyond belief. Yet she always kept her integrity in  tack. I didn't think that this constellation of traits could spell out  success. But you couldn't cross the line with her in regards to her career.  And boy was she smart. I can see how all these &quot;power-house&quot;  directors and producers could fall so totally in-love with her without even  a kiss. Read this book. And try to understand this woman. It will be very  hard. A director made an anti-semetic remark about another actress in a  play. She fired him on the spot. She took on Louella Parsons and Hedda  Hopper, later to become friends with both. She seemed to have &quot;I'm  Going to Be a Star&quot; etched in her brain. Whether it be in opera,  acting, comedy, and whatever you can think of. But she would NEVER  compromise her principles. This is all good news for males and females who  believe in these cynical times that &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;. In  the other biographies that I have read of highly successful people, luck  had a great deal to do with it. She went beyond luck and was qouted has  stating in 1940 to a reporter that if you don't change with the times, than  you are dead. I think that everybody should read this biography. General  Chinese Gordon had the tenacity and kindness of MacDonald. But he wasn't  extremely ambitious. Gordon's match is the closest I have come in my  reading of biographies that matches the profile of MacDonald. Sir Richard  Francis Burton stated that Gordon's best trait was his &quot;control&quot;.  But MacDonald comes close. In fact, I would bet on MacDonald. It doesn't  matter that she never reached the historical heights that these other men  obtained. She was incredible. She had all these extremely powerful  Hollywood moguls on a leash like poodles. Something couldn't be done, but  she would do it. Incredible will-power. Incredible kindness. Read this  biography about a truly incredible woman. And throw away all those  &quot;trashy&quot; Hollywood biographies. They are all garbage. This one  stands at the top. Fascinating!. Fascinating!	2000-06-10

In Marin County, a woman was leaving her entire family forever. Her reason was &quot;I have to do SOMETHING for myself!&quot; Her children said that they would call the  police. Browne's book has been a center of controversy since it first came  out in hardback in 1973. He was once epitomized as a Guru! Once again, I  will only relate my own experiences. When I attend to Bill Butler, like I  did before I became an altruist, I become happy. I am reading a book on  coins now. I am reading a biography. And I am turning this vector out and  away from helping others in order to help myself. To feel good about  myself. To satisfy my needs. And it FEELS so liberating. Now here is the  paradox. When I do this, I become kinder to others. Less angry. Because I'm  taking care of yours truly. Now this is the crux at which I believe Browne  was getting at when he wrote this book. Which has become sort of a classic.  I do not understand it. As Browne states in the first part of this book, he  lays down what he calls the &quot;Identity Trap&quot;. This is a two-edged  sword which Browne deals with quite well in laying down all the other traps  that Browne enumerates. Browne states that if you are trying to conform to  other's wishes and be what they want, you are in the Identity Trap. The  other part of the Identity Trap is when you desire other's to conform to  your wishes. The bottom line is that only when you truly are selfish, only  then can you bring about the attributes that are truly giving and kind. But  this tendency is very tricky. We become attached to people. And we want  them to be other than what they are. This generates terrific anger. Or we  try to conform ourselves to what they want. This creates tremendous anxiety  and tension. This book strikes a chord in what is good and lovely. One last  thing. Vote for Harry. I am doing so because I like his values. Good luck.	2000-05-28

Then I asked everybody else that I know, and they said, &quot;Of course! Her book is the best.&quot; May I please ask the reader  why they had not told me about it? I buy organizational books every once in  awhile hoping that they will do all my work for me. I have about 10. Some  are real &quot;killers&quot;. Details, details, details. Push, push, push.  Then there are the voluntary simplicity ones. &quot;If it's difficult, then  don't do it.&quot; This is true! In my opinion (and it seems everyone  else's), this is the best. You will find this book like a kindly companion  guiding you along the way. My favorite is her method of choosing names for  your files (no! She does not like a &quot;miscellaneous&quot; file. She  will explain why after you start using her book). She suggests that you  &quot;feel&quot; what name is right for a file. And it can be anything! But  it will set off a trigger in your brain. This is a stroke of genius. I'm  sorry to criticize. But this is a review. Another book which I won't name  (&quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Organized&quot; HA!) has all  these horrible plexi-files that can be fitted together for a  &quot;complex&quot; system. All it gave me what was a headache. Will Rogers  stated, &quot;I have never met a man I didn't like&quot;. Bill Butler  stated, &quot;I never read an Idiot's book that I did NOT dislike.&quot;  Anyway, BUY THE BOOK. It is so simple. While accomplishing so much.	2000-05-28

As did Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and Charles Dickens. HA! I received an 8.5% drop in my depression by using this book for over a month. When I went into the  library and looked at one of those fat medical texts not meant for you and  me, it recommended &quot;FEELING GOOD: THE NEW MOOD THERAPY&quot; by David  Burns. I looked up the ratings in newspapers and magazines. They loved  &quot;FEELING GOOD: THE NEW MOOD THERAPY&quot; (NOT &quot;The Feeling Good  Handbook&quot; which I am reviewing). Later, I checked the net. Right! You  are learning! &quot;FEELING GOOD: THE NEW MOOD THERAPY&quot; by obscure  obscure scientists who sit in university basements all day experimenting  with their rats. HUMOR! You can't improve on perfection. And Burns, like  other psychiatrists, has inadvertantly watered down the standard layman's  text for psychiatric disorders. Yes! &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood  Therapy&quot;. He seems to get caught in digressions and &quot;thought  baloons&quot; and all sorts of new gimmicks in this book. &quot;Feeling  Good&quot; was  very hard-hitting and direct. My warden recommended it to  me. HUMOR! (I now refuse to use that STUPID smiley face or &quot;LOL&quot;  anymore - I'm depressed. I just want to slug that smiley face. And NEVER  say to me, &quot;Have a Good Day!&quot;). I  would buy his first book. Come  on. Give me the name. &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot; and  hang out with it only.

They are not cutting through the fat and reducing our environmental problems to it's simplist component. Which is, according to Gore, over-population in the Third World. The  answer, according to Gore, is education about birth control. I agree with  him on these points. But he wants to use governmental control to enforce  this education. The rest of the book relates other environmental topics to  this problem. BUT GORE STATES THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO DEAL  WITH IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IS OVERPOPULATION IN  THE THIRD WORLD. Hello? Anybody home? Or do too many people get lost in  endless details of the book. In &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;? Scarlett  was selfish. Rhett hated himself. Therefore, he was attracted to her.  PERIOD. Deal with common denominators. Not &quot;word power&quot;. So the  question comes down  to the individual. WILL THE PRIVATE SECTOR COME FORTH  AND REPLACE GOVERNMENT THROUGH<br />GENEROSITY? If you think not, vote for  Gore. If you think yes, vote for Bush or Browne. I've talked to so many  people. Even a taxi driver. They all don't know. And after a lot of  research, I don't know. So I'm not voting. I'm tired of being wrong!  Nevertheless, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; does deal with all these  issues with the implication that we do need government to enforce these  policies. A good plan is to read this  book and then read  &quot;Environmental Gore&quot;. And then choose. One is liberal and the  other is Libertarian and recommended by the Libertarian presidential  candidate, Harry Browne. I haven't read this last book. I was going to  order it from Amazon.com and do a comparison between the two books. Maybe I  still will. And then just vote based on JUST THESE TWO BOOKS. Not a bad  plan. I'll have to re-read Gore's book again. Good luck.	2000-05-21

All you can really do in a review is tell about what you experienced. This course is supposed to have been written  by Jesus. And it has been torn apart by the illustrious critics, Ken Wilber and Mike  Murphy of Esalen fame. They scream (perhaps too loudly) that it is false.  You will eventually hear this anyway, so let me be the bearer of bad news.  They state that the scribe's semantic structure matches that of Jesus!  Helen Schucmann(?) has written poems that sound just like the course! So  the course, therefore, is bogus. Also, they claim that Helen was reared in  a New Age Bookstore. AND that she used to go out on a cliff and pray for a  &quot;Course in Miracles&quot;! That she was not simply a college worker  who suddenly heard  a voice. The voice of Jesus. I followed the course for  69 days. It is rough. And my ability, as the course describes, to see auras  around objects  rapidly increased. But I needed to anchor myself in sitting  meditation in order to contact God. So I quit. I have heard that the  results are tremendous. It takes 1 year. There are 365 lessons. You will  not finish the course if you listen to critics! This is a given. Or if you  question the course itself. You will need to jump! And be very dedicated.  If it is any consolation,  Methodist Churches (some!) teach this course in  church. Just don't get caught up in the DEBATES. Intellectuals never seem  to make the grade. If anybody criticizes another spiritual path, they are  mere &quot;pundits&quot; or theologians who have far to go. CULTS are paths  that state that &quot;Our path is the only path&quot;. That's a cult. And  they need critics. This is not a cult. I got very good results. I learned  (not completely!) how to forgive and a little about how I project my own  faults onto others. The &quot;Special Relationship&quot; sounded nuts to  me. But I found out that all religions agree. If you concentrate all your  love on one person, you are excluding the rest of mankind. And it is not  really love. It's attachment. And as the course emphasizes over and over  again, this attachment can be reversed into love if we understand that we  become attached to others because we want what we project onto them.  Strength, kindess, whatever. We covet it and use them as an object. I hold  no opinion on this. Please decide for yourself. One thing I do know. Keep  your mouth shut up about your spiritual practice! When times get rough, you  WILL remember! The critics!  This applies to any spiritual path. Good  luck.

Although I am a Self-Realizationist now (originally an Episcopalian), you are going to have a &quot;troubled existence&quot; as either a &quot;born again Christian&quot; or &quot;Fundamentalist Christian&quot;. As the  notorious Rush Limbaugh stated, &quot;You can always feel safe when your  new neighbors are Christian Republicans.&quot; But it is very hard for  them. Because of the intellectual elite which know a lot about nothing that  matters. Why did an all-forgiving Jesus state that He would return and put  all sinners in hell forever? How can God, if He is all-powerful, allow such  horrible suffering? His Holiness the Dalai Lama has stated that the  &quot;Big Bang&quot; may be the act of a Creator (in Buddhism, there is no  creator). He goes on to state that if this is true, then there indeed may  be spiritual laws!  (Buddhism only believes in cause and effect). So throw  out all the intellectualism. It gets vey tiresome. Christianity can only be  reached on faith. And if you find yourself arguing about church doctrine,  then you are following into their trap (a World of Words). This is one book  that will help. ESPECIALLY when your faith begins to fade. Of course, it is  no replacement for the Bible. But it is structually sound for all  Christians (if you don't get sucked in by, well, people like I used to  be!). In Christianity, you won't get by with reason. Only faith. And this  is very hard. Not to get lost in words. I believe that you will have to  become a &quot;positive thinker&quot; in order to dispell all the curve  balls that Satan will pitch at you. It's also an added protection. Let's  just not mix this book with the Bible. As a Christian, one is to believe  that God and Jesus are synonomous. That non-believers and sinners will go  to hell forever. SO BELIEVE IT! Buy this book because it is a really good  defense for all Christians not to become sinners. Yes. Reading the Psalms  may be the best solution. But this book will help so many Christians. My  good friend Sharon is a superb Christian. And she practices the Bible!  She's a Baptist and a very good one. She loves Jesus the Lord. THESE ARE  NOT AFFIRMATIONS (AS IN &quot;NEW AGE&quot;) in this book. It's Christian  Psychological Thearapy. I read it when I was 10 and once again when I was  40. Don't pass Peale up.

The rest of the book deals primarily with what a high-fat animal-based diet does to us. As someone stated, &quot;We kill animals and they kill  us.&quot; This is the very best book on vegetarianism. Both from a health  standpoint and from a moral standpoint. What they do to the animals we eat.  They just don't kill them. They torture them unmercifully in order to make  them more eatable. Sort of like an ANIMAL AUSWITZ. Allow me to state that  again. THEY JUST DON'T KILL THE ANIMALS. They snap off chickens beaks, fill  cows with dangerous hormones, and make young calves stand in small stalls.  All in order to increase profits. Robbins goes into great detail about how  an animal diet can be destructive to our health. His graphs are wonderful.  Do I eat meat? Yes. I'm sorry. But it's hard. I'll give it up. I have a  friend named Min in Canada. She is on a high-protein diet. But she is a  real &quot;go-getter&quot;, generous, and kind. A high-protein diet has  increased her energy level and she is doing wonderful on it. I think that  the pivotal point of Robbin's book is the torture involved. At least that  can be stopped.

I don't know why.  Each chapter is like a slice of heaven. Bradbury just hits on every note of &quot;What Could Happen But You Were Afraid to Ask&quot;.  And he does this in the simplist way. No long ordeals of  &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot;. He just rips into your brain  with the ease of a good brain surgeon. How can I review this book without  giving anything away? Alright. I will try. The Martians at the funeral will  chill your bones. The astronauts finding their homes on earth after they  land on Mars will force you to be with them and share their elation. How  wonderful! Spender's compassion will make you question his solution. And  you will feel for him. The astronauts dealings with the Martian  psychiatrist will make you re-live all your experiences with doctors and  dentists. You will feel like them. The appeal of this book is rough to  figure out. I think it's because Bradbury gives us &quot;snapshots&quot; of  our own fears and desires in short and brief chapters that make us feel  untouched but shaken. He gets the needle into us deeply while seemingly  doing nothing in order to do so. In other words, he delightfully blows our  minds. Thank you.	2000-05-21

This book was compiled by the leading investigator of depression in the United States. You will like him and this book very much.  Each treatment for psychiatric disorders gets a certain number of points  for  effectiveness and for side effects. This book is the best that science  has to offer in relation to depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, dieting,  sexual problems, and on and on. I do believe that you would be a fool if  you did not buy it. Why? Because it's the best that science has to offer.  And this means &quot;outcome studies&quot;. An outcome study (a good one)  is having 5,000 take a placebo for depression and 5,000 people taking  thiamine. Both without knowing whether the pill is a placebo or thiamine.  If 4,200 lose their depression with the thiamine and only 1,700 with the  placebo, other surveys are needed for further investigations. YO! What  happens if the thiamine has a temporary effect and then leaves this control  group worse off than it was in 1 year? What happens if the thiamine has a  &quot;feel good&quot; effect but then decreases your concentration? The  standard treatment for severe depression is mainly antidepressants like  Prozac. A woman just lost her spouse of 40 years 6 months ago. This would  qualify her as having a &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. As her  therapist, you give her Prozac and sessions of cognitive-behavioral  therapy. Which is supposed to back up the Prozac. What about trying to  persuade her to get out with other people? To start a new career. THESE  LAST TWO SUGGESTIONS CAN'T BE USED BY SCIENCE BECAUSE THE DATA CAN'T BE  QUANTIFIED!  It can't be isolated. If she meets rough people, maybe her  depression will worsen. If she meets people with similar interests, her  depression may dissapear. BUT BUY THE BOOK. Let's not dismiss science.  Science gives us something to consult so that we don't fly back to the dark  ages. Let's just put it into it's proper place.  Good luck.	2000-05-20

I bought both this book and &quot;Beyond Power Yoga&quot; from Amazon.com. From reading many of the reviews and beginning the program, I found this book quite misunderstood. YES! You will be sweating eventually. And Birch  makes the point early on how to oxygenate your body. First, through  aerobics. Second, by increasing THE WAY THAT OXYGEN IS CONSUMED INTO YOUR  BODY AND RELEASED!  What good is aerobics going to do you if you are  &quot;hunched over&quot;? This is a silly concept. Birche's husband is a  long-distance runner and does Power Yoga in conjunction with it. But Power  Yoga is a workout in itself. It's wonderful.  You begin and end with Surya  Namaskar. In English, this means &quot;Sun Salutation&quot;. Now the  program begins with your feet. It is important to have them aligned while  standing. This orientation is greatly put by Birch. You lose a tire but the  axel on your car is bent. You put on a new tire.  That IS NOT going to do  any good. Because the alighnment of the axel is still wrong. So you need to  restructure your stance in opposition to just lurching into a bunch of yoga  exercises. Now about this &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;sweating&quot; bit.  Yes, of course you will sweat. But at YOUR OWN PACE!  I started doing the  Surya Namaskar exercises (which are most of the program), and I would just  quit after two or three. And then add another. And so on. I didn't sweat.  But when you are really standing and stretching and dancing - you will  sweat. And this program does distribute a great deal of  &quot;power&quot;  or life force throughout the body. Immediately. As soon as you raise your  arms behind your head, oxygen will come into your lungs automatically and  structurally sound (as we talked about before). So buy this book fast.  Order it from Amazon.com and use it forever. Birch allows you to miss some  days in doing the program. It's just a tremendous way to do yoga!  That  ends the review except for people who want to know, &quot;Why arn't you  doing them forever, Mr. Butler?&quot; I'm going to Recovery, Inc. meetings.

She had a  dog named Maddie who was to be put in a doggie's home. I took the dog. Maddie was a German Shepard mix and a whole lot sweeter than  human beings! Everybody loved her. But when I walked her, she would chase  after other dogs. And she would howl terribly at them. I got this book at a  yard sale. What Woodhouse said in it frightened me a great deal. A CHOKE  CHAIN!  YELLING AT THE DOG!  It was a riculous book. But Woodhouse  assured the reader that a choke chain would not hurt the dog or even cause  ANY pain (if you did it right). And she also said that the yelling was  necessary. I didn't want to yell at Maddie. I don't like people who hit  their dogs, not counting their children. But I had to do something. Every  30 min. walk and bathroom session and Maddie would go crazy at some  neighbor's fence that had a dog in the yard. Pretty soon, I would avoid  certain parts of the<br />neighborhood in North Hollywood. I bought the  choke  chain, reluctantly put it on Maddie, and followed Woodhouse's orders. I  also used her &quot;voice&quot; technique. When Maddie would go after  another dog, I was to yell real loud, &quot;BAD DOG!  REAL BAD BAD  DOG! &quot; (this once scared a policeman out of his pants! ) Using  Woodhouse's advice, the choke chain caused no pain! I  examined Maddie's  eyes to see if there were any pain as I used it. Nothing at all. She didn't  mind it a bit. But you will have to use it as Woodhouse states. Like a  flick of the wrist. The next part was rougher. Screaming at Maddie when she  would go after other dogs even with the choke chain on. I was also  instructed to pet and praise her when she would pass a dog who was barking  or just sitting quietly. This took about 20 days. And every now and then,  she would have &quot;relapses&quot;. But after one month, she was a real  sight. And never went after other dogs. Then came a bad part of Woodhouse's  books. Excessive petting. Yes, according to Woodhouse, you can pet your  dog. And snuggle them. I would scratch Maddie's belly 400 times at once!  But Woodhouse implied that this was habit-forming. And so I did cut down  (not by very much, maybe 50%), and Maddie seemed much less restless!  And  she sure loved her belly rubbed! So this book really helped me! I had to  give Maddie back when the owner got out. It was rough. But I did it. Maddie  was over 4 years-old when I took her. It was the right thing to do. I don't  want to think about it.

I don't have diabetes. But my mother has had it for 61 years. If you are a real &quot;nut&quot; like me (GEEKHOOD), you will want this book. There will be better diabetes management than with the original management  appraoch. I WANT TO FOLLOW THIS PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE  DIABETES!  Based on the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complication Trial)  which conducted a study on 1,441 diabetics. The results were incredible.  Chances of eye damage decreased by as much as 76 percent. Kidney damage, up  to 56 percent. Nerve  damage, up to 60 percent. As compared to  &quot;convential therapy&quot;. It is the best. This is called  &quot;Intensive Therapy&quot;. The prior diabetes management is called  &quot;Conventional Therapy&quot;. Then there is &quot;Denial Therapy&quot;.  The last is what most people do. And I have great compassion for them. They  just deny their diabetes!  The purpose of  this program is to keep the  LEVEL of your blood sugar as constant as possible. Thus remaining in  maximum health. The good part is that you probably will be more heathy than  the average individual because you are paying more attention, much more  attention, to your health! This program is for both Type 1 and 2 diabeties.  If you have a friend who is not a geek, then send him/her &quot;The  Diabetic's Book&quot; via gift from Amazon.com (and then don't say another  word unless they ask for help). The results with &quot;Conventional  Therapy&quot; are not as good as &quot;Intensive Therapy&quot;, but some  people simply don't have this &quot;NUMERICAL&quot; lifestyle. Don't bug  any diabetic because you are attached to them, please. It just doesn't  work. I got my mother to use her diabetes machine by using myself as a  human guinea pig. And she would pay attention to my measurements and how  you do it. A little. Took about a month and I had to read &quot;How to Win  Friends and Influence People&quot; all over again! But it worked. So don't  &quot;strong-arm&quot; anybody about this program. I don't want to be  gruesome. But if you scream at your loved-one to take care of themselves in  this case, they may end up blind and with cut-off limbs. Alright? Patience.  One diabetic doctor told me that mathematicians and engineers who love to  keep charts may want to use &quot;intensive therapy&quot;, but that's about  it! I'm not updated on diabetes. Look for the &quot;buzz words&quot; DCCT  and &quot;Intensive Therapy&quot; in the newer books. Two more things. Most  diabetic doctors or even plain physicians are simply way too  slack on  diabetic care (I think I fired 3!). But these books are a little bit too  detailed. Exercise physiologist? A good idea. A good &quot;idea&quot;.  Dietician? Another good idea. Another &quot;idea&quot;. So strike your own  path. My mother is taking care of her diabetes better than she has in 61  years! But my brother and I would never force this program, &quot;intensive  therapy&quot;, on her. Angry criticism helps no one ~ Winston Churchill.his program. I don't want to be  gruesome.

I looked it up on Amazon.com and the only customer reviewer said that it was outdated! And I wondered why it had not been updated. I compared the review with the picture and description by  Amazon.com. Sure enough! 1994 was the last edition. The reviewer was  correct. But I wrote a review anyway. And admitted I was wrong (which is  highly unusual for me). Amazon.com printed my review but then updated their  picture and description to a 1999 edition!  Well, I can swing accolades at  the book now. Just grab it and you will become interested in the question  and answer format. It's an Advanced Dr. Seuss book for type 1 and 2  diabetics. My 78-year-old mother has never read a book on diabetes  despite  having obtained the disease 61 years ago at the age of 17. The  psychological &quot;shock&quot; is horrible for ALL individuals. I tried to  get her to read this book  and that book for years. But this book is like  Adam Khan's &quot;Self-Help Stuff That Works&quot;. It's big and clumsy.  Big bold questions which are followed by succinct answers. I will make an  alsmost quarantee about this book. Or about any teen. If you buy the book  and just hand it to them, it is very likely that they will read  &quot;some&quot; of it. Because it is so user-friendly like Adam's book.  Just leaf through it and you can put it down at anytime. NO COMMITTMENT! I  love this book. I'm going to buy the updated copy real soon (within 30  days) and the &quot;Diabetic for<br />Dummies&quot; book which came out last  year. She won't look at the Dummies book. But you just flip open this book  and you're studying diabetes!  Good luck. I'll review one more diabetes  book for obsessive-compulsive math &quot;freaks&quot; like me who love  strategies. Good luck and God bless.	2000-05-14

A psychologist e-mailed that when I gave this book one-star before, I was very incorrect. He stated that he agreed with me in part, but that he has gotten results in the past by delving into the the childhood of some of his  clients. But he agreed that there should be no blame. This book is a must  read for ALL practioners. Jack makes a code for the ethics of teachers.  This book covers all those questions you are afraid to ask. Psychotherapy  and meditation as a form of treatment is covered in detail. If you are  going out of your mind, Jack has a whole algorithym of how to deal with  these &quot;demons&quot; as he calls them. If this doesn't work, go to step  2. And so forth. So I would recommend this book for anybody, but not  everybody. Jack states that meditation is not psychotherapy. Well, I talked  to a secretary at the Insight Meditation Society which Jack created. And  she told me that Insight Meditation is HER therapy. And please watch out a  little for the suggested reading. Don't blame anybody for the suffering you  are in or it will just get worse.

I walked out of a bookstore with this under my arm and thought, &quot;Well, I don't have to worry about health anymore!&quot; Boy was I suprised. And a little stupid. As I read the book, I realized that he  practically wanted you to devote your entire life to this program! And I  didn't know where to start. So let us begin. Are you a good cook? I don't  mean a goumet gook. But just a really good cook? If no, please buy  &quot;Cooking for Dummies&quot;. It's an incredible book and there is only  one of it's kind. Even if you consider yourself an excellent cook, please  buy this book. You will learn a great deal. Second, are you eating a good  diet? A good BASIC diet. If not, buy &quot;Dieting for Dummies&quot;. And  follow it. Okay. So now you are doing pretty good. You know the basics of  good nutrition. And you are a very good cook. Please buy &quot;The Wellness  Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition&quot;. This is a real text. But it tells  you how to buy the best types of grains, fruits, vegetables, meats in the  grocery store. The best seasons. What colors. How to squeeze. All of it so  that you simply get the best produce available. You will need this book  before following Wiel's program. You will need to be a good &quot;produce  picker&quot;. The information is incredible. Now we must be critical of  this book we are reviewing.  YOU CAN'T FOLLOW IT. The 8-week bit is a bit  of hipe. But you can start to introduce into your  lifestyle (diet,  exercise, meditation, and so forth) elements of this program. Dr. Wiel  suggests this as a possibility!  So read the program and then begin to  introduce his suggestions as he makes them. This point is very important.  Because, otherwise, you will just quit. Yes! You can do the entire program.  But it will take much longer than the 8 weeks promoted. Wiel does add  things slowly during the 8 weeks. But much too fast as you will find out. I  hope these comments will help you and to make it easier. The book is  excellent. But I firmly believe that it takes a lot of preliminary practice  in other areas. But once these habits are established, they are established  for life. Good luck.I firmly believe that it takes a lot of preliminary practice  in other areas.

Well, we all follow &quot;the experts&quot; (although at 48, I am beginning to learn). We all follow the authorities. What would happen if one just kept a totally blank mind toward everything and learned from just  plain LIVING. Gandhi makes it clear at the beginning of the book that this  is the only way to gain truth. Not to be strongly influenced by others. His  agreements and fondness of other theologians really only comes after his  experiments. They have to agree with him first. As you begin to read this  book, you are on a jouney.  It's like being a Martian or being from another  planet simply because Gandhi will simply not take anything as truth unless  he has experimented with it himself. He was very much the spiritual  scientist. This book is also very easy reading. The chapters are short  enough to stop and come back to as well. And it is journey which Gandhi  makes clear that anybody can follow. You can't really follow this man's  experiments. He wants you to do your own experiments. So this book is  really quite an adventure. Gandhi's politics, as he makes clear in this  book, really stem from his experiments in truth. You can begin yourself.  Wake up, tell your wife she is fat, and see what happens! Gandhi came to  the conclusion of always practicing &quot;ahimsa&quot;. He would practice  it over and over again to see if it worked. And he came to the conclusion  that it did. As he once said, &quot;Ahimsa is heaven&quot;. Ahimsa means  non-violence in thought, word, and deed. One can still defend oneself while  loving one's enemy. He saw &quot;satya&quot;, or truth as synonymous with  non-violance. This man stole at one point, eat meat, was far from celibacy.  Buy and read this fabulous scientific inquiry into &quot;How to Live&quot;.  Then start experimenting for yourself. Good luck on your journey. And  please be careful!  Gandhi nearly killed himself SMOKING!	2000-05-06

But he is wrong about the treatment of out-of-control drinking. Like all Rational-Emotive Therapists, he does not acknowledge that there is a subconcious. This  creates very difficult problems. Why? Because there is a subconcious and it  carrys mememories of pain/pleasures. Alcohol creates EXTREME pleasure in  the brain. Jack's method is good. But the forcefulness of AA is really an  overhaul of certain symptomatic beliefs deep in the psyche that need to be   removed. The Beast also includes sex, hunger, thirst. What Jack is doing is  creating impressions in the brain regarding alcohol that will counteract  our perceptions of events. But in order to cut deep into the brain, one  needs group support and a belief stonger than oneself. One's Higher Power  can be &quot;humanity&quot;. Or the &quot;Goodness of Mankind&quot;. You  see, when these alcohol impressions in the brain are cut deep enough, one  forms a disease of going directly to the behavior that reduces the pain.  This is especially the case in getting leukemia  or one's spouse dying. One  can drink oneself to death with only a bag of cognitive tharapy techniques  based on Metaphors such as &quot;The Beast&quot;. If one has gone over the  line with alcohol, constantly using it for pain reduction - one is in deep  trouble. I include myself. If you don't have group support or a  Higer  Power, you are in great trouble. Now some of the reviews are written by  very intelligent people who can speed through recovery based  on reason and  logic. But for intense alcohol abuse, one needs a really rough program. No.  Alcohol abuse is not a physical disease &quot;per say&quot;. It is a  disease of the mind which can effect the entire body and turn it into a  physical disease. I went into a physician many years ago. I had blood  withdrawn. They were testing for all kinds of food allergies and fumes and  mites, and so forth. Out of about 50 allergens, I was only allergic to  wheat. I got a 4 out of a possible 4. The doctor couldn't understand why I  would come out so negative on all the other allergens and come out totally  positive on wheat. He asked me if I drank. I said yes. He said, &quot;That  has to be it.&quot; This is a physical manisfestation of alcohol abuse. We  could argue on and on. As a member of AA, okay, some people can quit and  never drink again. And AA says this is not true. But the very structure of  AA is very rigid and enormously powerful. Yes. You do have to be sort of a  fanatic. Or a Marine. The 10% recovery that AA now claims while it used to  be 70% in the fifties is a low blow by Jack as a pivotal point in his  argument against AA. Especially since he claims that his program also has a  70% success rate. This is primarily because of the &quot;scorecard  method&quot; in AA where people tell the government that they will they  will go to AA in order to get lesser sentences. So they just walk through  the program and drink again! This is a very vital point that Jack doesn't  seem to want advertised. For &quot;gutter drunks&quot;, Jack's program is  like using a BB gun against a tank. It won't work for really severe down   and out drunks. It can be effectively used for people who have a  fundamentally strong &quot;pyche structure&quot;. They can just talk to the  BEAST and go off booze. But some people are simply egomaniacs and they need  their brains sliced to ribbons  and re-targeted for an unselfish lifestyle.  Or they will die. In this regard, Jack is  doing a terrible disservice. And  the &quot;semantic game&quot; is getting a bit redundent. Do you need to go  to groups forever? Is alcohol abuse a  &quot;disease&quot;? On and on. Is  AA a cult or a religion instead of a &quot;spiritual path&quot;? This  scientific approach began with Ivan Pavlov and B.F. Skinner. Was inherited  by Joseph Wolpe who was dethroned by cognitive-therapy. And has cut though  into recovery issues. Let's move on to a more Einsteian viewpoint rather  than the Newtonian Physics of old. There are &quot;good vibes&quot; at AA  meetings. A smile brings health. The Serenity Prayer works. The steps work.  Let's get away from pathological self-reliance. And let us understand that  the Stoicism of reason can olso be a Religion to many people. They are  Scientific Mateialists and believe that we pass into a peaceful oblivion  after death. Take this view away from them, and they howl like crazy. This  religion was created by Epictetus in Greece. Jack seems to want to  substitute one form of religion for another. A rational belief is still a  belief. Whether it is based on science or reason. And all such beliefs have  their deepest roots in a religious view of somekind. In this case,  Scientific Materialism which is based entirely on the empirical senses and  the structure of mathematics. If there is a Higher Power or intuition, it  can not be ascertained  through either empiricism or logic. Which makes it  antiquated in the worst possible way. It won't work.	2000-05-05

This is a biography of Yogananda by one of his youngest brothers. Don't expect Yogananda to be like he was in his autobiography. I would advise you to please read the autobiography first. Mukunda (Yogananda) could be trying, to say the least. All this energy would culminate in his Worldwide  Mission to bring yoga to the entire world. But let us face facts. He did  have a temper in the early days. He would spend time in graveyards  practicing tantric yoga!  This brought a lot of dismay to his father who  had to take a firm but gentle hand with him. He would frequently hypnotize  the author until his father finally put a stop to it. Yes, he was a tiger.  But a benevolent one. He was determined to find God as described in his  classic autobiography. But I don't think he was ever secure until he found  his Guru, Sri Yukteswar. This work also corresponds with the biography. In  that work, a chapter is written on how Yogananda simply insisted on going  to the Himalayas despite his<br />Guru's admonitions. So this biography simply  highlights this man's life from an outsider's  view. It is a very wonderful  book about a  simply wonderful man.

I suppose you want clarification. THE REAL STORY BEHIND LAW AND ORDER IS CRAZIER THAN ANY SERIES COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE!  It's nuts. But the the series is great. I read it about six  months ago.  The actors kept having fights. One main character came on the  set and proclaimed that he was among the handful of greatest actors in the  world. Chris North was told 1 week before a season started that he was out.  Put in a black. Done. Put in a woman. Done. No, the combination of  detectives and/or attorneys is too strong. Now too weak. AND THE WHOLE CAST  SEEMS TO HATE EACH OTHER. Anyway, back to business. Each show is listed.  The writing is beautiful and honest. The portrayals of the actors is  truthful and insightful. It's a wonderful show. But when you find yourself  reading the book while episodes are on, something is terribly wrong. The  book right now is on my bottom shelf and I'm not even going to look at it  for this review. I haven't seen an  episode for 6 months! I'm going back.  Probably the best series ever. And the best book on a series ever written.  But right now my hands are healing from reading the book. And my eyes are  healing from watching the series.

This review is for her. Because I believe I didn't give a  satisfactory answer. That I was basically the same as I was a year ago. But  I have learned. BUY AND READ THIS BOOK. It's really the best on  benzodiazepene addiction. Drummond is a fully qualified pasychiatrist who  will help you get off these killers. It tells you HOW to stop. HOW to taper  the dosages. Now most doctors and psychiatrists  don't know how to do  this. So please buy this book. After you are off benzos in 6 weeks ( a  program no one recommends now), you will have what they call &quot;rebound  anxiety&quot;. This means that your anxiety will jump 6 times the normal  level. So do the 10-percent solution. You will find this in Peter Breggin's  &quot;Your Drug May Be Your Problem&quot;. Also buy Breggin's book along  with this one. Be a little cautious about Breggin. He is also strongly  against Ritalin and Prozac. Drummond's book stands in the middle of this  controversy. I went from 24 mgs. of Valium to 18 mgs. I feel so much  better. Stable. Less crazy. This is the way it works with BENZO ADDICTS.  Get off it and only use them for emergencies. I have a friend in San  Antonio named Ed. He is stuck on Xanax. We are doing research on this.  We  do feel better off these drugs. But they very well might not be the WHOLE  answer as Breggin implies. Drummond in &quot;Benzo Blues&quot; does not  imply this. He gives many healthy alternatives to the &quot;leveling  off&quot; effect of Benzos. Ed and I are having trouble with this problem  (I have been a Valium addict for 30 years)because personal problems hit us  and WHAMMO! Choke on blood or take a BENZO. Drummond does seem to say that  seeing a psychotherapist is mandatory. Maybe YES maybe NO. To date, it  hasn't helped Ed nor I. There is one more book that I hope you will order.  &quot;Coming Off Tranquilizers&quot; by Shirley Trickett. She has schedules  that you can pick among many. And she gives a real healthy view on how to  get off. Drummond, Breggin, Trickett. According to my psychiatrist, I  should have been off Valium 29 1/2 years ago. It's only caused tremendous  damage. And I am fighting for my life. So buy Drummond's book and those two  others. Get a good alternative (mine is 2 hours of meditation daily! No, I  haven't started yet! Not even 10 minues daily. If the truth be known, I'm  scared to get off it. Oddly enough). Now &quot;Benzo Blues&quot; is 300  pages. It IS hard reading. But if you are a BENZO freak, you will need it  along with those two other books. I was going to a mental center, and they  cut me from Valium without any consultation. They demanded that I come in  even though my brother has picked them up before. I alledgedly made a  threat because going &quot;cold turkey&quot; off a Benzo can cause  seizures. I was put in a booby hatch for 5 1/2 days. Get off this junk. But  be wary of the &quot;witch hunters&quot;. I don't know whether Trickett and  Breggin are such. But with this book, which is quite academic and  pragmatic, you can make accurate decisions. And if you've been on benzos  for over a year, you are an addict. Don't go through what I did and may  never get over. Valium is now part of me, my brain, my perceptions. I wish  you very good luck and Godspeed.d nor I.

It is really quite simple. There are three areas that we have to deal with as Yogananda explains. First is the subconscious which has to be bombarded with &quot;positive ions&quot; and affirmations. As well as the right kind of positive thinking. See  &quot;Scientific Healing Affirmations&quot; on this theory. If you are  financially troubled, do the &quot;prosperity affirmation&quot; in that  book. I  haven't been homeless in 3 years! And while homeless, I chanted  that 50-word affirmation about 500 times in all conditions and in all  weather. It's hard to practice yoga when you are broke. And I am still  living out my nightmares psychologically. But let's get back to the book.  The second phase is dealing with the &quot;concious mind&quot;. Here is  where Yogananda stresses that YOU have to make somekind of concious effort.  Finally, deep prayer to God in order to receive aid. I would like to add a  couple points. It is very popular today to &quot;Find Your True  Vocation&quot;. Half-truth. Yogananda stresses in his lessons that you  life's vocation really begins to develop between the ages of 3 and 12. He  advises a two-pronged approach. Do some of which you really love, BUT KEEP  WORKING AT THE JOB YOU HATE AND EVEN TRY TO DEVLOP SOME INTEREST IN IT. Do  both! And one last point. If you love being a trash collector, then do it.  Yogananda's view of success has been modified greatly in the last few  decades. $$$ and ***. Do what you love but eventually try to love whatever  you are doing! Good luck.	2000-04-30

I am have also been involved with substance abuse (Valium) and occasional alcohol abuse. Brother Bhaktananda initiated me into kriya yoga in 1983 and was  a disciple of Yogananda's while the  latter was still living. Once I was drunk and I called Brother Bhaktananda  last year. I was just through! I was drunk and crying. I asked for advice.  Bhaktananda told me to use chants. One was &quot;Scientific Healing  Affirmations&quot;. The other was &quot;Whispers from Eternity&quot;. Just  to read a little bit from each book. I asked him if I could still reach  enlightenment in this life.  He said yes. But I was just going through a  rough time and many lessons. He is usually so sullen. But now he was so  kind. I told him I loved him. He said he loved me. This book is beautiful.  But very esoteric. Like flowers. At first, it just looks like a book of  poetry. So it is very subtle. And, sometimes, this can work the best.  It  can get beyond the head and into the heart for real healing. The pictures  in this book themselves are real healing. They touch your heart. As do the  wonderful prayers. Sometimes you just have to relax, I feel, and let go.  This book is not a must read. It's simply &quot;must&quot; medicine for  your soul. I talked to Brother Bhaktananda a week later when I was sober. I  still told him I loved him. He said, &quot;And we all love you. We are  praying for you, Bill.&quot;	2000-04-30

But as Yogananda explains, if you are sceptically minded like myself, you will have doubts. People who use their intellects will balk. Did you know that if you are on a Boing 727, the odds are that two people sitting together will have the exact same birthdate! A miracle! I see auras. The truth is that anybody can see auras. Out of the side of  your eyes. And you can see all of this in Kirlian Photography. So I'm a  real &quot;Hard Sell&quot;! Also, when people tell you they have seen Jesus  or Bugs Bunny, you will have to rule out imagination, schizophrenia, drugs,  lying, and wishful thinking. I personally have seen the spiritual eye 30-40  times between the eyebrows. The yellow ring is full of a field of blue.  Right in the middle of the blue field is a five-pointed silver star that  flickers. This is all very beautiful. I have tried to time the stars  flickering. I ascertain that it flickers about twice a second. I have had some experience  despite my concrete sceptism. I have read this book 8 times. Words do have  an effect on the brain. These affirmations make imprints (or what Hindus  call &quot;samskaras&quot;) on the brain. Now this depends on two factors  according to Yogananda. One. Repitition. Two. Intensity. The more of these  two, the deeper the cuts into the brain. The deeper the cuts, the more you  bypass the concious and cut impressions into the subconcious. The  subconscious is really quite stupid. It will simply follow what it is fed.  It's like a computer. Or what you might call a &quot;biocomputer&quot;.  It's mostly tied in with the autonomic nervous system. But it will do  brillantly what you feed it. It is fed from the concious mind. Yogananda  tells you how to cut deeper and deeper into the brain. Say out loud,  &quot;I am old&quot;. Then whisper it. Then affirm it mentally.  That is,  say it mentally. Eventually, this becomes &quot;subconcious chanting&quot;.  What is that? The SUBCONCIOUS WILL KEEP ON CARRYING THE CHANTING BY ITSELF  ALL THROUGH THE DAY AND NIGHT. This changes your brain and your entire  body. You will begin to hump over and acquire some wrinkles eventually.  This is not strange IF YOU REMEMBER THAT THE SUBCONCIOUS IS MERELY A  MACHINE WHICH CARRYS OUT ORDERS. That's all we skeptics really have to  know. There is also supercious chanting. Now this is an Einsteinian concept  rather than a Newtonian. Everything is connected to everything else. We can  see this with our eyes. The chanting eventually cuts so deep with  repitition and intensity that it begins to affect our environment. At this  point, the chanting is causing an environmental change around us.  Those of  an Einsteinian bent will understand this. So our words have a deep affect.  Miracles have happened for me with these chants. MAYBE! I'm a sceptic. If  one of Yoganda's books fly off my shelf at this moment, I am not going to  exclaim that it is the work of God while I am writing this review.  Scientists call this  &quot;Select Abstraction&quot;. That is, you assign  all coincidences to a certain cause. How about an  earthquake? Or the book  being ready to drop out of the shelf? These chants work. BUY THE BOOK. It's  not like seeing the silver star. But we skeptics can be assured through  cause-and-effect experimaentation on ourselves that they do indeed work.  You can feel it. Good luck and God Bless.NTING BY ITSELF  ALL THROUGH THE DAY AND NIGHT. This changes your brain and your entire  body.

This is the last book of Yogananda's trilogy. The first is &quot;Man's Eternal Quest&quot;. The second is &quot;The Divine Romance&quot;. And this is the third. The first is just wonderful. Buy it! And also &quot;The  Divine Romance&quot;. They are very user-friendly for everyone. I know the  head of the Self-Realiaztion Fellowship's Publishing Department.  Brahmachari Fred. He's a wonderful gent. But I hope he doesn't get angry at  me. If you are new to Yogananda's teachings, go it slow with this book.  Take it in &quot;nibbles&quot;. The first book is the softest. It aims at  LIVING. The second is a bet harder. It aims at DEATH. This one aims  directly at YOU! No punches are pulled. It's like the preliminary book to  becoming a Self-Realizationist. Yogananda socks it to you. There. I said  it. He is telling you what to do in order to get to God. It is interesting  reading. I think it just might scare off some people who have not read and  studied the other two books. Even in dietetics, he gets rough here. Same  thing really. Just more detailed and descriptive. Much more direct. Beyond  direct. If you have never read Yogananda's works, start with &quot;Man's  Eternal Quest&quot;. This book, &quot;Journey to Self- Realization&quot; is  my favorite. And I'm sorry Brahmachari Fred if I disrupted sales. But this  is pretty &quot;hard whiskey&quot; for a beginner. I really love it though.	2000-04-30

The Buddha stated that the ultimate and best form of government is anarcy. And since Murray Rothbard is an Anarchist Libertarian, he is in good company. In this book, Rothbard goes into great detail about the details of Libertarianism. Even covering who will own the  ocean! I like the form of government that I envision. It is based on  Gandi's &quot;Voluntary Socialism&quot;. But with only one change, is  also  anarchy. Or Anarchist Libertariansim. Let's discuss Rothbard's vision. Then  Gandhi's. And then a compromise. Rothbard states in this book that there  are two types of Libertarians. Gradualist Libertarians. And Anarchist  Libertarians. He uses a push-button analogy which is stated as such. If you  had a button right now that would destroy all governments immediately,  would you push the button? If your answer is yes, you are an Anarchist  Libertarian. If you want to dismantle government gradually,  you are a  Gradualist Libertarian. Rothbard  makes it clear in this book that he is an  Anarchist Libertarian. Now for Gandhi's Voluntary Socialism. In this  system, envisioned by Gandhi, people could become as rich as they wanted.  No taxes. But they would be required to work for the needy by government.  Now for the Bill Butler Libertarians (which is sort of a combination of  Rothbard and Gandhi). All bussinesses and peoples must give 10% of their  gross income to the needy and must give 10% of their working hours to the  needy (roughly 4 hours) OR they will be boycotted from the rest by  Libertarian citizens. What this means is simple. I am writing a review for  Amazon.com.  I ask for proof that they are giving 10% of gross revenue to  organizations which help the needy and that their employess put 4 hours  weekly to helping the needy. Let's call this Liberal Libertarianism to  distinquish it from the other systems. If Amazon.com does not comply, I  will not buy their books or videos. I will not  write reviews for them. As  a CITIZEN, I join other citizens in &quot;boycotting&quot; them. And all  other businesses which do not comply. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT ACTION  INVOLVED. Just boycotting by private citizens according to a specialized  code of conduct. The Libertarian Party needs such an understanding before  it can thrive. Remember, the Buddha stated that anarchy will GRADUALLY be  the ultimate form of government.  Buy the book. Rothbard is very  insightful.in other citizens in &quot;boycotting&quot; them.

How can I out do the review by ASTRAL? His review is a work of poetry. And yes, I did vote for it. I read this book many years ago. I found it deeply inspiring. I have seen the spiritual eye many times (as I've stated many  times!). Please read the chapter titled &quot;Jesus: A Christ of East and  West&quot; to find out a description about it by Yogananda.  It is THE most  beautiful thing that YOU will ever see. I'm a kriyan or Self-Realizationist  yogi. This book is truly a gem. But I follow all of Master's (NOTE:  &quot;MASTER&quot; means one who is able to deal with all of life's  situations - not like Frankenstein! ) teachings. If you really want to get  into Yogananda's teachings, here is the book for for you. Okay. BUT IF YOU  ARE A SELF-REALIZATIONIST, PLEASE STICK WITH THE SRF LESSONS BEFORE JUMPING  INTO OTHER BOOKS. Yes, you can read them if you have the time. Brother  Bhaktananda clipped my wings a little. He was a  devotee of Yogananda's  while Yogananda was still living. I sent him some of my reviews. I  especially wanted him to hear about his reaction to my review, &quot;God  Talks to Arjuna&quot;, which was translated by Yogananda. It's over a  thousand pages and my favorite book. Brother Bhaktananda said, &quot;It's  very good! Now what are you going to do with it?&quot; Ouch! So this book  is wonderful for those who want to jump right into Yogananda's teachings  BUT ARE NOT SELF-REALIZATIONISTS. First study the lessons. Then the service  readings. Then the books and recordings. I think the recordings and videos  can be very inspiring if you live half-way across the world. If this book  tastes good, then buy the second in the trilogy, &quot;The Divine  Romance&quot;. Then &quot;Journey to Self-Realization&quot;. I've been very  lucky. SRF, which is my church, has given me permission to practice Insight  Meditation for psychotherapeutic reasons along with any other spiritual  paths that may help my depressive disorder. SRF is not a &quot;cult&quot;  simply because they do not believe that thier way is the ONLY way. This is  another reason to buy Man's Eternal Quest. You can dip your beak wherever  you want with SRF! It's not a closed system.

Both of the previous named were four-star admirals.  If you have been in the Navy, I will warn you that you won't put this book down  once you pick it up. (remember, I warned you). McCain leaves nothing out.  My favorite anecdote is when McCain leaves Naval College. He and his  fathers seem to always be the leaders wherever they go. But after  graduation, the McCain Clan (yes, he was a  &quot;hell raiser&quot;) were  divided into two camps. Those married and those not. So McCain's camp was  cut in half. He was dating a real doll (but not of the most genial quality)  and they more or less invited themselves to the Married Officer's party.  Stone silence. Nobody could talk because someone (McCain) had apparently  brought a skunk or woman of &quot;lower breeding&quot; into the room. After  several more minutes, this woman took out a switchblade and started  cleaning her fingernails with it! McCain grabbed her hand and made a hasty  retreat! Yes. McCain loved to  raise cane. I don't want to review the part  after he is captured. It is simply amazing that he survived. The beatings  and torturings went on and on and on. They became worse during the last 18  months of his capture. Because he could leave any time! The North  Vietnamese wanted him as a  pawn because his father was now in total charge  of our men in the Atlantic. He went by the code. 1) God 2) Country 3) The  Alliance With Your Fellow Prisoners. But, after 18 months of tremendously  severe beatings, he did agree to the North Vietnamese's demands. In part.  McCain has a very soft demure today. But he is a very &quot;Tough  Monkey&quot;. I don't think we can imagine what he went through. A lot of  it turns my stomach. Hell! I would have cracked after 18 minutes of just  THINKING about what they were going to do to me. This part of the book is  real mayhem. So tread lightly. Many many of his friends were simply  tortured to death. And McCain does not pull back on the details. He simply  tells you what happened. Everything else leads up to this point. Where  McCain's personality takes on great compassion and devotion. Even though he  seems to be sick or dying half the time. Please buy and read this book.  Thank you.ath. And McCain does not pull back on the details. He simply  tells you what happened. Everything else leads up to this point.

For people of a more &quot;intellectual bent&quot;, this book may be the perfect opening into Yogananda's other books and works. According to this book, there really is  no pleasure. So what do we feel when we have sex or eat an ice cream cone?  First of all, the mind is just fine as it is. That is, you will not add  anymore pain. But by association in thought (thinking), one creates an  &quot;excitation&quot; in the brain. This is a desire and it causes pain  because we want the desired object.  Now here is the hard part. The  so-called pleasure is really just the removal of the WANT created by the  association in the mind. I thought  about writing a book review. Somebody  calls. I feel upset (pain). But the pain is caused by my having thought  about the book review in the first place. I created an  &quot;excitation&quot; or spark in the brain. Then this excitation was not  fulfilled. Great pain. But even if somebody doesn't call, and I do write  this review, THE FEELING OF PLEASURE IS ONLY THE RESULT OF REMOVING THE  ORIGINAL EXCITATION FROM MY BRAIN!  So, there really isn't any pleasure.  There is the pain of not satisfying the excitation and there is the neutral  feeling of satisfying the excitation (which will uninevitably arise again).  How do we get out of this quagmire of pain. Quite simple. Order this book  from Amazon. com.	2000-04-28

I received an e-mail from a lady who told me that rational-emotive therapy saved her relationship and maybe even her life! And I believe her. But some of us need more heavy &quot;Head Work&quot; I believe. Real &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;. Dr. Low teaches you cognitive-behavioral therapy in this  book. But he doesn't leave it  there. Daily readings. And ONE TWO-HOUR  MEETING A WEEK WITH OTHER NUT CASES!  Why am I screaming? Because it is  easy to sit at your computer and be mean. But you can't get<br />away with  this in real life. I read most of Low's book after my first meeting. I felt   excruciating anxiety for 4 days BEFORE THE MEETING!  I'm screaming again,  right? Sorry. And my reading didn't really DIG IN until I got to the  meeting. You say something and then everybody else contributes and then  these cognitive techniques are really cut into your brain. This is the main  text. So it is one-third of the program. The other two parts are daily  application and one meeting a week. It seems that  people with psychological problems make TREMENDOUS demands on themselves.  This book will re-wire your brain. And that may take awhile. But remember  this. According to Dr. Low, when you cut a &quot;temper&quot; sequence of  working yourself up into anxiety and anger or down into depression, you  will be automatically reducing those HIGHER STRESSORS which you will have  to confront. Let's make it simple. Asking a question of somebody on the  street may cause incredible anxiety. Let's say 99. But if you  &quot;spot&quot; this scenerio and replace it with realistic thoughts  (&quot;I'm not doing anything wrong&quot;) and endorse yourself (&quot;I  did just fine&quot;) - this process will reduce the the anxiety of public  speaking, say, from 1,000 to 859. Good deal, huh? As Low says, &quot;Strike  at the Weakest Link&quot;. If your dog dies and you have a BIG DEPRESSION  of 876, let us say, and you practice this program and your spouse dies, you  might only get hit with a 700!  Whereas, before, it might have been 7,000,  given you a stroke, and put you in a hospital. Do buy the book. I could  philosophize about all the chapters (Like &quot;The Courage to Make  Mistakes&quot;, chapter 30), but I think you now understand the whole  purpose of the text. If you don't want  to wait, then find out where the closest Recovery, Inc. Meeting is (they  are worldwide for those of you in Guam), take 5 minutes, run in, and buy a  copy. Good luck.	2000-04-28

The first involves becoming a Libertarian. Buy &quot;Why Government Doesn't  Work&quot; by the Libertarian presidential candidate, Harry Browne. Read  the book. And vote for Browne and against all government programs. The  second is to follow the 9 steps of this book. The problem is easy to  understand. Frances Moore Lappe stated in &quot;Diet  for a Small  Planet&quot; that the problem of starvation is caused by overconsumption.  Then she did further research and discovered that she was wrong. In a later  edition she states that every country is an &quot;open bread basket&quot;.  That is, every country in the world has enough food to feed it's own  inhabitants. But the governments sell the wheat and other grains outside  the country for higher prices. This includes the U.S. Now Donella Meadows,  author of &quot;Limits of Growth&quot;, states, &quot;If you want to know  how to make the maximum contribution you possibly can to the world - and to  your own happiness - follow the steps in this book.&quot; Now the approach  of this book will stop this problem if the world does it. BUY DECREASING  OUR CONSUMPTION, WE WILL CUT DOWN THE DEMAND FOR OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO SELL  OUTSIDE THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. There will be no motive for them to sell to  other countries. Now I talked to Vicki Robin on the phone. She told me that  anybody of any political party can follow this book. And her secretary told  me, and this is very importantant because it is not stressed in the book,  YOU CAN FOLLOW EACH STEP OUT OF ORDER. You can do step 2 first! Or another  step. Step 2 involves keeping track of all the money that comes in and goes  out for 1 month. The secretary has been financially independent for 10  years beacause of this program!  So for you who hate your work, BUY THE  BOOK. The steps will seem hard. Believe me. Counting every cent that you  have ever earned (step 1) is not easy. But the secretary told me that you  can jump around from step to step. In fact, the secretary told me that  after all these years, she STILL hasn't totally completed the steps. But  Vikki assured me that it is necessary to eventually complete all 9 steps.  So whether you are a left-winger or a right-winger, buy this book and start  feeding some babies. Good luck.have ever earned (step 1) is not easy. But the secretary told me that you  can jump around from step to step.

I followed this whole program. After you order the book, but before you do the 8-week program, please order the tapes in the back of the book. These will make doing the program 1,000 times more easier. I did it for severe  depression. I don't want to make any jokes in this review because some  people are in incredible mental and physical pain. This program has also  been  employed in hospital settings. You won't need  a doctor or a teacher  for this program. But there are a couple things to keep in mind. If I was  diagnosed with cancer, I would first get rid  of all junk foods. Then I  would pray to God as often as I could. And third, I would follow this  program. Even if you don't experience a &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;,  it can cut down greatly on chemotherapy and drugs. This program is for you  to &quot;feel&quot; your body and mind states. You will love the &quot;body  scan&quot;. Very healing. Each day, you will be asked to give 45 minutes to  each session. During this program, my depression decreased from 25% to 40%.  During a similar period of following one of David Burn's books for  cognitive-therapy, my depression decreased 8.5%. I quit both because I  wanted more of a comprehensive spiritual program. But if someone told me  that I had a fatal disease, this is what I would do. And there is one other  concern that I have. I want my mind to be pointed in the right direction  when I die. And it becomes extremely difficult when your body is being  pounded with tons of pain to have a  healthy and open attitude. But one is  supposed to be able to use the dying experience in an opposite position in  order to become a better person! I think that this is because when you  accept both physical and mental pain, there is a subtle growth process  behind it. When you fight it or resent it, it seems to build! Good luck.	2000-04-21

Now I do the Self-Realization Fellowship Energization Exercises. Now these exercises and the  &quot;Dhandhal  and Bhasky&quot; Indian exercises of muscle-building are  all identical. You go through the &quot;movements&quot; of using a barbell  but the energy is exerted to the muscle part. Do it now! Hang your arm by  your side. Imagine that you are holding a dumbbell in your right hand. Now  move the weight up to your shoulder WHILE  tensing hard to move this  30-pound imaginary weight. You should be &quot;pumped&quot; in that arm  after 2 sets of 10 reps. Primarily the biceps. Keep the palm up. According  to physiology, you did lift weights! Wong has you do both curls and tricep  extensions and other exercises of this sort. When I was like 31, I was  doing the Self-Realization Exercises. My arms measured 11 1/2 inches. After  one month, my arms shot up to 12 1/2 inches!  But with Wong's approach, he  concentrates on bodybuilding. I imagine that this would be great for women  bodybuilders as well. I love a 54 year-old-artist. Every year she gets more  beautiful. Her name is Nikki and she has an eye &quot;perfect for  form&quot;. So I may go back to bodybuilding. Wong's book, please! I don't  want my lumbar spine squashed by squatting with 300 pounds. The  ex-bodybuilder and chiropracter, Franco Columbo, says this happens after  many years of bodybuilding. And since Andreas Calling and Bill Pearls  advocate a vegetarian diet, this will go well with Wong's  work-outs. Which  are every other day. For the chest, you will be doing 24 reps of  &quot;concentrated push-ups&quot; with your feet on a chair. You will also  be doing the &quot;Vertical Press&quot; in which you will be doing bench  presses while standing! So don't worry about intensity.  But this IS a  program which matches Mike Mentzer's &quot;high intensity&quot; work-outs.  I'm 48. Albert Beckles was 52 when he came close to taking Mr. Olympia. Who  knows? But I do know that the exercises will &quot;pump&quot; you up and  &quot;cut&quot; you up quite well based on Nautilus research data. Then you  can add weights and cut their damaging effects to a very minimum. Good  luck!that the exercises will &quot;pump&quot; you up and  &quot;cut&quot; you up quite well based on Nautilus research data.

I don't know how she did it. Conversationally speaking, did you know that the fears we carry in our pockets or purses that are not dealt with cause excruciating anxiety. What do we do? Add Vitamin B to our diet? Put crystals in our pockets? Become a  yogi like me and levitate until your head hits the ceiling? OR...we could  do what we fear. How about that for an idea. I think they spell that  C-O-U-R-A-G-E. We don't need courage anymore. We have tranquilizers and  self-help books.  I want to give you a beautiful quote from this lady's  infinite wisdom (she's incredible!). PUSHING THROUGH FEAR IS LESS  FRIGHTENING THAN LIVING WITH THE UNDERLYING FEAR THAT COMES FROM A FEELING  OF HELPLESSNESS. This book is just beautiful. The book advocates COURAGE.  But she she shows you how to be courageous. Postive thinking, the  understanding between Pain and Power, the Real truth about RISKS and  GROWTH. You have to buy this book. It is a true gemstone.  Throw all your  other self-help books away except this one and &quot;Self-Help Stuff That  Works&quot; by Adam Khan. Since I am a Self-Realizationist (Yogananda),  this book interfaces with it quite beautifully. But this book is all you  need for your fears. Go ahead. And stop looking at whether you had a  traumatic childhood or not as Father Bradshaw advises. You destroy the past  by what you do in the future. And this book will help you do it. Good luck.  And I'm not afraid of you anymore! HA!	2000-04-18

I downloaded a very long article written by a Bhikku. He is very outranged by Kornfield and others of his ilk. He states that Buddhism causes the ceasing of ALL suffering. And that Kornfield's mixing psychotherapy in the form of Jungian and Reichian therapy is  rapidly turning American Buddhism  into diluted root beer. I would like to give a quote from this book. Then  maybe you can decide. Page 245. &quot;Problems such as early abuse,  addiction, and  difficulties of love and sexuality require the close,  concious, and ongoing support of a skillful healer to resolve.&quot; Well,  my good friend Ed in San Antonio and I have had very little luck with  therapists in an accumulation of over 60 years with a multitude of  therapists. Jack's pure love  of psychotherapy and fame seemed to have  rocked his brain. Does he know what he is doing? Nhat Hanh suggests in one  of his books that what he calls &quot;The Five Wonderful Precepts&quot; can  cure childhood wounds. If Jack thinks that we should<br />sit at a CoDA  metting with a Teddy Bear named &quot;Fluffy&quot; on our laps while we cry  out what our Mommy and Daddy have done to us, then okay. Page 221. &quot;We  can reflect on how needs were met in our family, how limits were set, how  insecurity was treated. Until then, we will repeat them in our spiitual  life. Twelve Step meetings offer participants to hear the personal stories  of other members. This honest telling of our family story can be a powerful  process in our sorting out health from dependence, respect from fear, and  finding a wise and true compassion.&quot; Well, Jack, I've been to 120  12-step CoDA meetings. I've lead groups. And I've spilled my guts for ten  minutes which is supposedly healthy. Everybody seems to be involved in the  John Bradshaw view of blaming your parents and your past. This is dharma? I  would read the books of Nhat Hanh and stay away from this filth. It will do  you no good.	2000-04-18

A lot of schools in Buddhism hammer in the need for study. Some Zen schools describe  such study as &quot;poisonous&quot; to your practice and preach &quot;PAINTED CAKES WILL NOT SATISFY HUNGER!&quot; My Thai Buddhist monk teacher told  me that I did not need to read anything, so this can  cause a lot of confusion. I do not want to upset your practice, but the  greatest book on how to do Insight Meditation seems to be &quot;Mindfulness  in Plain English&quot;. And the main Bible of Insight Meditation seems to  be this book, &quot;The Heart of Buddhist Meditation&quot;. I read it 25  years ago and immediately fell in-love. It really gets to the heart of  Buddhism. You will discover how and why the vipassana practice will help  you in ALL areas of your life. In relationships. In your job. In reducing  anxiety and tension. It is simply a must read for someone WHO IS NOT  PRACTICING WITH A TEACHER RIGHT NOW. If you aren't, get these two books.  The Why is in this book. The How is in &quot;Mindfulness in Plain  English&quot;. If you have $200, &quot;The Insight Meditation Course&quot;  is simply wonderful. And you will have a teacher by e-mail and by mail.

First, the fundamentals. There are five Tibetan rites. The first is just swinging around like an idiot. The second one is where you are just lying down and you raise your legs while touching your chin to you chest. The next rite is where you just arch your  back. The fourth is when you position yourself so you look like a table.  And the fifth is where you alternate looking like a &quot;V&quot; and and  then looking like a cobra. Takes about 5 minutes. Do each 3 times. If you  can't do any, don't worry. People who can hardly move are able to do so  eventually. Add 1 repitition a week and build up to 21 repitions. This can  take as little as 10 to 20 minutes. And that's it! How does it work? I've  studied a little yoga so here we go. At the very tailbone of your spine is  the muludhara chakra. This is where the kundalini rests. To make it simple,  almost all your energy resides in the bottom of your spine. Now think of  your Mother-in-Law or the presidential candidates. The shock of this  thought will cause  your spine to compress. Actually, what is happening in  yoga is that your conciousness is now residing in the bottom of your spine.  This &quot;stress response&quot; can eventually cause you to become  &quot;humped over&quot;. There is very little energy now in the upper  spine. The energy level is normally supposed to go UP the spine. But  because of the way people live and think, most people live in the lumbar  part of the spine during their whole lives. In an unconcious state. This is  why dugs and alcohol work. They send this energy to the higher regions of  the spine.  Unfortanately, this is considered dangerous because it is done  violently. Now eventually, the chakras above the lumbar spine almost turn  off. Now if you were to stretch the spine, wouldn't this release some  energy UP the spine to the higher centers? If you moved the spine up and  down, would this not release even more energy?  This is what the 5 rites  do. And they were designed for this purpose. They normalize the energy in  the body. When the body is normalized, the vital organs return to normal.  And  rejuvenation happens. Simply because these centers of the spine are  being &quot;watered&quot; for the first time in 20 years or whatever.  Perhaps that's why yogis refer to the centers in the spine as lotuses. We  need to keep them open. Now two more things. &quot;The Ancient Secret  Fountain of Youth Book 2&quot; has medical advice on using each rite. Why  not just play it safe and buy this book as well? Finally, if you burst out  in anger daily, buy &quot;Feel the Fear and Do IT Anyway&quot; by Susan  Jeffers. If you are subject to anxiety attacks, anger, depression - these  rites will help greatly. But whenever you think a horrible thought, the  conciousness in your spine will have a tendency to go to the bottom of the  spine. Buy the book I mentioned above and pump some &quot;positive  ions&quot; into your brain to avoid this. But no matter what, the rites  will even help demolish your negative attitudes. Why? Because you are  &quot;gushing energy&quot; higher up the spine and nourishing the higher  nerve centers. This makes it easier to think positively. In fact, the 5  rites are a good way to start to feel &quot;happy&quot; again. For those of  you who want to go farther, please buy &quot;The Ancient Secret Fountain of  Youth Cookbook.&quot; Also the video on the 5 rites. And &quot;the Five  Tibetans&quot;. Okay.

After reading through Exodus, you will feel that God is a monster who should be tried and hung. He makes Mike Hammer look like nothing! Brrrrrrrrr. Rough Dude. I like to think of God as trying to help  us. That HE has created Cosmic Law for are own good. And it is not He that  causes our suffering, but us. Despite the personification of God in the  Bible, I like to think of Him as a benevolent force. Like when your Mommy  told you not to touch the hot stove, but you did it anyway. I really hated  reading the Bible the first two times. But now I can see it in a  more  brighter light. When God told Moses to tell the Egyptian King that He would  take the  lives of all the eldest boys in Egypt if he did not let His  people go, we can easily project attributes on the subject, God. But what  did He look like? What color were His eyes? Was He tall or short? Did He  like popcorn? I think that the silliness of these questions brings us to a  state of mind which concludes that He is a force of somekind. And what if  we do remove the personification of God? Then how can His actions be  personified as well? That is, he killed as he pleased? Doesn't quite fit,  does it? Personally, I now feel that these horrendous actions were caused  by a violation of Cosmic Law. A couple other things. I'm a  Self-Realizationist. But I tried to keep my mind completely open when I  read the Bible. It does seem to me that God advocates vegetariansm. I know  I may be wrong. But it seems to be stated and repeated so often that a  reader would conclude that. Also, reincarnation. I don't know. This is a  tough book to entangle. I'm going to try to read it my THIRD time. The  vegetarianism stuff seems to get really hit hard in Neurotomy(?) I believe.  I advise a 365 daily reading list which costs about a quarter at a Bible  store. Then you can read it in one year. Most readings will just  take you  10 minutes daily. Some will take an hour. But they are rare. I think that  happens  in NUMBERS. Now I know why God titled it NUMBERS! I like the King  James version. I just think that it's more pure. Please don't argue with  other Christians about what is right or wrong in this book with other  Christians. That's really crummy and makes you a &quot;Crummy  Christian&quot;. I have to wait until January 1, 2001 before I start my  oddyssey again.

I  was reading a book which had a bunch of interviews with the most successful  programmers in the world. One was Czech and I do not remember his name. But  he was asked the following question. &quot;What in your opinion is the  biggest mistake that programmers are doing in their educations or their  work today?&quot; He answered, &quot;It's simple. They don't know how to  solve problems. At our company, we have some simple books that tell you how  to do this. The best is Polya's 'How to Solve It'. It has a little diagram  in the back that completely runs you through a series of questions on  solving math problems. But even in schools, they don't take this approach.  Everything is by rote and repetition! You solve a problem and YOU DON'T  KNOW WHAT YOU SOLVED! We have a lot of these little books.&quot; The late  Isaac Asimov wrote a beautiful little book called &quot;The Realm of  Algebra&quot;. It's out of print. But he explains the entire realm of  algebra in something like 150 pages. The best book I've ever seen about  math. Math can be fun. Programming can be fun. But only if you ask Polya's  questions in the back of this book. &quot;What do I have to do to make this  problem complete?&quot; &quot;What is missing from this problem?&quot;  &quot;What could I add to make this problem solved?&quot; A two page  diagram in the back. And everybody knows that programming is just  &quot;crummy mathematics&quot;. BUY THE BOOK! BUY THE BOOK! BUY THE BOOK!.  2 pages in the end of this book and at least 50% of your math/programming  problems are down the drain. Buy the books for your son if you are a Betty  Crocker. Or your daughter.

In physics, they state that the simplist concepts are simply too simple to understand at first. This book, based on Rational-Emotive-Therapy won't work in the first week. But the process will begin to change your brain  cells immediately. And it is simply too simple to understand. This is the  best book on RET. It has been re-titled TMT (Three Minute Therapy) because  there are some major differences. It is simpler than other forms of RET.  Much less complicated. And much more &quot;user friendly&quot;. It's easier  to use because it is simply easier to remember. Edelstein's contention is  that human neurosis is based on one's demands on oneself, on others, and on  the universe. When these &quot;demands&quot; are found and removed, the  pain is  removed. Edelstein won't postulate on rather a subconcious exists  (I think it does), but he does imply this case because he says this  training may take years. And this book is hard work. If I were to say to  you, &quot;It only takes 6 to 9 minutes a day&quot; that would seem  marvelous.  No! I used Wordpad for 1 week. And you will have to really go  at it! So prepare yourself. I'm sorry to state that I quit! The book wasn't  doing it's job. Actually, I wasn't doing my job. Edelstein gives credit to  both Stoicism and Theravada Buddhism. He crashes Alcoholics Anonymous. So  he is an iconoclast. I wrote a review on &quot;Rational Recovery&quot;. I  used Lois Trimpey's name and described her as &quot;Shirley Trimpey&quot;.  I saw this mistake last night. I<br />felt riddled with humiliation. About 90  in the SUDS scale. I looked for the demand. It was a highly unreasonable  demand on myself. I told myself that lots of people make mistakes. It's  impossible not to. And I did not make a fool of myself. SUDS went down  immediately to 70. Which is quite a lot for me. Last night, I had a sore  throat out of nowhere. I started to panic. I looked for the three types of  &quot;demands&quot;. This was a &quot;demand on the universe&quot;. I told  myself that whatever will be will be. There is nothing I can do about it.  Yes, one thing. Make myself miserable. SUDS went from 90 to 50!  And I  went right asleep. TMT does not interfere with Theravada Buddhism which I  am currently practicing for mental health. In fact, Edelstein suggests two  books on Theravada Buddhism for further reading! And quotes the Dalai Lama  in the beginning of one of his chapters! Albert Ellis wrote the  &quot;intro&quot; to the book and highly recommends it. I might go back.  But if you  do follow TMT, expect it to be a real philosophy of life. I'm  preparing myself for it. And it is really more like 18-hour therapy. You  just can't put in your six to nine minutes a day (2x3 mins. or 3x3 mins.)  and be done with it.

But this  path, Theravada Buddhism, is &quot;bare bones&quot; and  &quot;no-nonsense&quot;. The only object is to enable you to fill great  bliss and joy.  Such a joy that you can't even imagine now. But it's  &quot;bare bones&quot;. There won't be any God. You can believe in God if  you want. But it has nothing to do with this path. No prayer to a Higher  Power. You can do that if you want. But this path doesn't advocate it. You  simply sit on your butt and learn how to pay attention to the breath come  in and leave your nostrils. Each chapter will tell you how to deal with  distractions, pain, progress, thoughts, and emotions. Now I can't do this.  I want a total path in which I can believe in God. So I am a  Self-Realizationist. I just can't seem to last without a path so  beautifully pragmatic but doesn't deal with afterlife or God. The other  problem that you may find with this book was discovered back East by the  meditation master, Jack Kornfield. Over 50% of meditators have trouble  sitting steadily because of deep emotional problems. Now the author deals  with these. But if you just can't sit for 20 minutes without exploding,  what are you going to do? A Matthew Flickstein co-authored this book with  the Venerable Henepola Gunaratana. And he has created a book for us  &quot;disturbed ones&quot;. Buy it if you simply can't sit. And give it a  try. &quot;Journey to the Center&quot; by Matthew Flickstein. The  introduction is by the author of  &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot;.  I started following it. I will give it my total dedication. One small other  problem with this book, which is really quite minor. After about two-thirds  down the path, you will need guidence from a teacher because the &quot;mind  states&quot; that are keeping you from total happiness become very subtle.  Don't sweat it! The internet is already providing instruction for people  without a teacher! And one Thai teacher told me that you don't even need a  teacher. It's best to check up with one, though. As this book states, you  can actually get hooked out on &quot;blissful states of mind&quot;. Before  the real happiness or freedom is obtained. There. Put this book under your  pillow and get rid of all your other books if you can sit, and don't demand  a path that advocates a Higher Power.lickstein co-authored this book with  the Venerable Henepola Gunaratana.

And it does seem incredibly simple-minded in the extreme. While Jack  acknowledges a mid-brian &quot;thirst&quot; for the alcoholic which can be  talked back to, Ellis is sticking totally to the A-B-C method for  alcholism. The examples he gives are really funny. The client states that  he had no thought about drinking. Then the RET therapist<br />interrogates the  client! &quot;You must have had some thoughts&quot;.

As if Ellis wrote it on the  subway to one of his singing lectures. If you are a falling down drunk, go  to A.A. A Rational-Emotive Therapist told me that she has had &quot;good  luck&quot; with her clients going to Alchoholics Anonymous!  And she just  thinks the world of Albert Ellis. Yes, I was seeing her for help! But the  government refusedto pay her even after it was agreed (please see my book  review on &quot;Why Government Doesn't Work&quot; by Harry Browne). Anyway,  don't buy this book. You won't like yourself after reading it. It just  won't do the job. I have been dry for 70 days! There is this wonderful  woman I want to date. She made it definite that I had to go dry for 100  days. I got drunk and e-mailed her that she was &quot;fridgid&quot;. 100  days! It's too simple-minded.

But it is just too far a goal...for any biographer! FDR's &quot;limelight&quot; period lasted 12 years.  Eisenhower's lasted 20  years! From the beginning of World War II to the end of his second  presidency, everybody knew who Ike was! But the meat of this biography is a  bit too lean. We need more fat. The book, in trade paperback edition, is  600 pages. It's great reading and I recommend it highly. But we don't  really get to know the man. We need more fat for that. Not an  interpretation. But some real facts on what the man said, did, and wrote  outside of his  accomplishments. The reader is left to guess. We follow his  &quot;military&quot; and &quot;political&quot; career quite well. In fact,  almost perfectly. But were their any facts that we know that motivated the  man? What little things did he do? What were his favorite colors? Did he  ever tell anybody off? To make it short, after reading this biography, you  will agree that this was a great man. But you won't know WHY he was a great  man. Without getting gossipy, was his wife an alcoholic? And what was this  reaction on him? This is very important! We want his &quot;worldview&quot;.  We want to know the man. To discover what he was by very personal facts and  then make our decisions. It needs 400 more pages (all fat!).	2000-03-15

One tires of Hemingway's tireless digressions and narcissistic portrayals of himself. Steinbeck's attempts to create atmosphere in order to overcome substance just didn't seem to cut. I just don't like fiction because the  author's seem to be living in a &quot;dream land&quot; and they then  project this onto the written page. Then I read a book about a bunch of  bunnies. In fact I read it twice. The first fifty pages will be hard  reading. Simply because the bunnies are simply not very romantic  and are  simply trying to survive. The writing itself is incredible. But what makes  this book  great is that these bunnies are how people actually are in real  life! We have always known people how are quiet but natural born leaders.  People, at first, look down on them. But their dipolomacy and selflessness  leads a group into safety. He is truly brave but not a &quot;natural  born&quot; fighter. Then there is the<br />fighter with a heart of gold and  filled with good intentions. These people do not want to show how much they  care so they are a little bit aggressive. And they are not diplomats. The  first is Hazel, who isn't a small rabbit, but  slightly less than average  in size. Bigwig is the second. He is a large rabbit and a great fighter.  The one rabbit who Bigfoot will finally confront is one big mean  &quot;Momma&quot;. Whew! These type of people want power and control. The  more power  and control they lose, the more they want. They usually  self-destruct. It's a bit different with this rabbit. Hazel will lead his  rabbits among thick and thin. But the amazing thing is that he knows how to  pick the talents of  his group and he doesn't seem to have any real unique  talent except to size up the situation totally. That and his unselfishness.  He even calls on his weak brother, Fiver, for his intuition. But the main  genius of this book is the exact match of bunnies with all the humans we we  have met (which is really quite funny!). One bunny just conforms to his  fate and takes everything that is tossed at him. I won't talk about this  warren. It is chilling to the bone. I would rather watch the  &quot;holocaust&quot; on TV. Stephen King, the horror writer, stated that  this book can really &quot;chill&quot; you out with horror.  What humans or  rabbits can do under adverse conditions is quite sick and understandable. I  keep &quot;blanking out&quot; when I remember that part of the book. The  end comes in a smashing series of encounters in which you know that  Hazel-rah (the leader) can not simply win. In fact, a very small chance. To  see if he wins, buy the book and read it.e  have met (which is really quite funny!). One bunny just conforms to his  fate and takes everything that is tossed at him.

What this book postulates is a new world view. The book is wriiten by recorded talks of Paramahansa Yogananda and the sisters and  brothers of Self-Realization Fellowship. The whole book really represents an idea. I  will be honest and state that I have trouble with it.  Maybe you will not.  One chapter is entitled, &quot;Change Yourself, Transform the World.&quot;  The other ideas stress this idea over and over again. This is an election  year. I think that  we all want a better world. The idea goes like this.  Take 10 people. 3 Democrats, 3 Republicans, 3 Libertarians, and 1 of the  Reform Party. The world world be a better place if one of these parties was  dominent. Let's take the Republican Party. We have 3 &quot;good guys&quot;  among the 10. Now let us swith to the new &quot;transition&quot; that this  book proposes. Among the 10, there are two people who inflict pain on  others(1 Republican and 1 Democrat), three people who constantly cheat on  their spouse (2 Libertarians and 1<br />Democrat), and two more who cheat in  business practices (1 Libertarian and 1 Republican). The 3 remaining people  do no harm to others. Now the premise of this book is stating that the 3  remaining people are doing the most good for mankind. No matter what party  they belond to - as long as they transform their &quot;own&quot; behavior.  Politically, in other words, we are just a drop in the bucket. But  Paramahansa Yogananda has stated, &quot;Reform Yourself and You Will Reform  Thousands.&quot; I have trouble grasping this, but perhaps the reader will  understand. They even reply it to religion! A well-behaved Muslim or  Buddhist can do more to help the world than even a Self-Realizationist. Or  a Catholic priest!  An athiest can be more spiritual than one who is a  Self-Realizationist or Unitarian if he behaves him or herself and does good  to others. AN ATHIEST!  Yogananda does not seem against any political  party or  religious belief. On page 151, Yoganda states, &quot;I believe  that there will always be wars, until perchance we all become so spiritual  that by the evolution of our individual natures, we will make war  unnecessary.&quot; Okay. I love this book. Even though I don't quite  &quot;get it&quot; yet. Oh! Yoganada was for voting. But for who, I can't  imagine. It seems the best way to change the world is to change oneself.  Well, maybe... Buy the book and decide for yourself.believe  that there will always be wars, until perchance we all become so spiritual   that by the evolution of our individual natures, we will make war  unnecessary.&quot; Okay.

This a  program designed for recovery from alcohol and substance abuse using  cognitive techniques. And it has over a 70% rate of success. 3) This is  where you better go out right now and buy this book right now or order it  from Amazon.com. This is the stage where you have been arrested for drunk  driving, you clobbered your you wife but don't remember doing so, you drink  all the  time, you wake up in places where you don't remember having got  into.

And there does seem to be an altruistic streak running through this man's spine. Forget that he is worth $85 billion dollars. You better. As Gates  points out constantly in his book, these figures are going to mean less and  less as we move into the next century. This book and CD is a good  prescription for what Toffler calls &quot;Future Shock&quot;. Gates  does  indeed show you the road ahead, how things may very well be 50 (40[30])  years from now. He does not say that it is good or bad. He does not  foerwarn us about getting out of touch with our &quot;inner goodness&quot;.  He doesn't take any stand! He knows that he is not better than anybody  else. But he also knows that he has access to &quot;see&quot; what may very  well be ahead. And he is enough of a gent to share this with you and me. I  do believe that he sees the whole  &quot;Gates Phenomena&quot; as a  process. That his shoes would have been filled with someone else's even if  he were never born. This also was the case with Thomas Edison. Many were  directly behind him. But he wanted to &quot;own&quot; the past. Gates shows  no such egomania. His humility  is quite refreshing. And the book is really  fun reading. Even if you are not a &quot;computer geek&quot;, read this  book. It will take away a lot of the anxiety that surrounds people who feel  &quot;left out of it&quot;. After you read it, and if you are computer  illiterate, you will feel so much better. Just do it!	2000-03-03

Refer to page 10 of &quot;Book one: How to Cast a Horoscope&quot; in book one of the Astrology Kit. Your horoscope will be judged on the position of the sun and the moon at the time of your birth.  From there, you fill in all the conjuctions and aspects of the other  planets for additional readings. But the author states that you can not  know the position of the moon unless you know the exact time of your birth!  Such as 9:43 a.m. If you don't, you will have to guess among three sun-moon  horoscopes as to which is yours!  Good luck. Now if you do know the exact  time of your birth, you won't have  to guess ONLY if the time of birth was  not early in the day (let's say between midnight and 3:00 a.m.) or late on  that date (let's say between 9:00 p.m. and midnight). Then you are to  choose between two horoscopes based on which one you are most alike. Since  I know that I'm a highly intelligent and loving saint, this wasn't hard for  me (JOKE!). But that still leaves the odds at 25% of missing. And many of  the aspects and conjunctions will be based on a very possibly erroneous  moon sign. So you will be just be having fun and be giving a bad name for  astrology in the process. Simply put, if you can't obtain the exact time of  birth, your chances of being  right are 1 in 3. And if you do know the  exact time, it's 75% in your favor. You can do better. Buy Suzanne's White  &quot;The New Astology&quot;. And if you want to go deeper, get one of  those exact time charts. I did a woman's astrological chart whom I met on  the internet. She turned out wonderful according to &quot;The Astrology  Kit&quot; (we are to date soon). Using this kit, I now wonder if she will  slice me up into little bity pieces and stuff me in her mailbox (joke, lol,  hiccup). Good luck future astologers of America.	2000-03-03

This book is put out by the people of e-Bay. And it seems the best for all Ebaysians. The Big Theory is that e-Bay will not tell you &quot;insider tips&quot;. Not true. This book does tell you about &quot;sniping&quot; and  they do tell you it's fair game. They even tell you how to do it!  So I  would forget this theory, primarily since it is absolutely false. This is a  review on &quot;The Official e-Bay Guide&quot;. But although it is the best  book on e-Bay, it is not the only book on e-Bay. Some &quot;sticklers&quot;  will even tell you that you need no books on e-Bay. Just follow the e-Bay  tour. Don't believe it! I have a friend who I let borrow these books (too  be honest, I'm still afraid to use them!) He is on his way to  becoming a  millionaire or even a billionaire. He told me, &quot;Thank you, Bill, for  buying these books. They were really indispensable for  building my  business (he had given me the &quot;yackety -yack&quot; about 'all you need  is the e-Bay tour'.&quot; I ordered them from Amazon.com and I am sure that  I will NOT be written about in HIS biography. But I do ask questions and I  do observe. He seems to give major credit to this book. About 50%. Oddly  enough, he gives about 45% credit to &quot;eBay for Dummies&quot; by Roland  Woerner, Stephanie Becker,and Marsha Collier. The other 5% goes to  &quot;Online Auctions at eBay&quot; by Dennis Prince. Now Mr. Moneybucks  tells me he doesn't even want to borrow the last book anymore! I have  Prince's book here by my side as I write this. I like the guy. It weighs  more than the other books. More pages. Your guess is as good as  mine! I  think that Prince just makes everything that is simple, complicated. From  what I can tell. Anyway, order those two books from Amazon.com IF you are  on eBay or want to BE on eBay.

This book, I feel, comes closest to describing a) where we came from b) why we are here and c) where we go after we leave. Athiesm has some good points. But if we are &quot;concious  meat&quot;, then where does the conciousness go when we die and are just  meat? This postulates that a state of mind or conciousness can dissapate  into a &quot;peaceful nothingness&quot;. This is in direct contradiction to  Newton's Law of Conservation. I have seen the silver star that Yogananda  talks about in  the book. It is surrounded by a gold ring  and lies in a  field of blue. The five-pointed star seems to flicker at the exact rate of  twice a second. I've seen it 30 to 40 times, and it is the most beautiful  thing I have ever seen. I have talked to many other yogis who have seen the  exact same thing. I am not very advanced spiritually. I called an SRF  counselor many years ago and simply asked him how somebody as messed up as  me can have these experiences especially since I am not schozphrenic and  have never seen the silver star while drunk. He said that spiritual  development is contingent on how much you love God. Everything else is  superfluous. Well, I love God more than anything! And I love my Sat Guru,  Paramahansa Yogananda, more than anybody. Please buy this book. But with  one warning. All of the miracles are indeed true. But since the entire  universe is indeed made out of light, nearly every manifestation will  someday be able to be explained. When you analyze radio waves, we can come  up with explanations. But they are really more far-fetched than anything in  this book. Oh! The SRF monks keep telling me something else. Even though we  feel that our way is the best way, it is not the only way. Muslims,  Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, and even some athiests(! ) can reach  God faster than any Self-Realizationist. Simply because they are following  spiritual laws. I am very grateful to Self-Realization Fellowship and the  fifty or so monks that I have talked to on the phone. I am especially  grateful to Brother Bhaktananda who has helped me so greatly. He knew  Yogananda when he was still in his body. And he never looked down on me for  my clinical depression or my alcohol abuse. He simply kept reminding me,  &quot;We are all praying for you, Bill.&quot; I am very grateful. Some  yogis can see the silver star with their eyes open! I can only see it with  my eyes closed doing a certain yogic<br />technique. It's between the  eyebrows. Kindness seems to be the pathway to such advancements. And I am  not kind yet.

There are mistakes, and there are MISTAKES. Oy! (And I'm not even Jewish). As the economist Milton Friedman states, &quot;Good intentions can do the worst harm.&quot;  This is really a good novel. Miller and Wingrove are not bogged down by the  game of MYST. So this is really good stuff. Their previous book was a tad  boring (to say the least) and rightfully so. It needed the same modality as  the game. But this is a really good science fiction novel that stands on  it's own. And you will find out where D'Ni is. It may be no futher than  where you are standing (wink! wink!). I really liked Veovis. The D'Ni are a  bit stoic, and their treatment of him was reprehensible. They done him  wrong.

If you find an age that is Utopia, would you  not ask why the food magically appears? Who milks the cows? Atrus gives the  very strong impression of  being the worst thing possible. A, well,  &quot;liberal Democrat&quot;.  I'll stick with Veovis and  Gehn. Even  Catherine knew that something was amiss when they entered this age. At  least at first. Atrus seemed to become &quot;whacked out&quot; with luxury  and humanitarianism. Nevertheless, this is a good end to the trilogy. Oh!

This is simply a superb book about a great man. A truly great man.  Yet so few people know about him. We are very lucky to have a wonderful biography such as this published about such a truly superb  gentleman. Today, the &quot;in thing&quot; is to talk about values. Values,  values, values. I feel that George Marshall was the greatest American of  this century. It is a priceless gift that the biographer has given us in a  beautifullt printed format. Extremely well written and, best of all,  totally objective! Marshall was a bigger military giant than Eisenhower,  Patton, or MacArthur. In fact, during World War II, he was so greatly  needed that President Roosevelt gave him a choice about becoming the  supreme commander of all allied forces in Europe. Either he could do so, or  stay in Washington where he was much more valued. He virtually ran  everything except for FDR. One choice meant giving up fame and glory for  the likes of you and me. The other choice meant<br />glory, fame, and 20  biographies written about him that you can buy at Amazon.com. Knowing that  he was more greatly needed in Washington than in London, he gave up his  life's dream. He handed the star role to Eisenhower.  Who, as many of us  know, became president as the result of Marshall's decision. Here are some  of what this man was: 1) He never lied!  (talk about values). 2) He never  cheated on his wife (both Eisenhower and Patton were not so lucky). 3) He  never killed anyone. (He stated that &quot;10 minutes of combat are 10  minutes too many&quot;).  He was a  true blue gent. And when is values were  being  walked over, he told off numero unos General Pershing, President  Roosevelt, and President Truman!  In the first two cases, he expected to  be fired. He burned his war time journals after the war because he did not  want to hurt anybody. That was the caliber of the man. Yet he could be very  ruthless when he thought what he was doing was right. In preperation for  World War II, and as Commander-in-Chief, he kept a black notebook for  prospective &quot;young&quot; generals. He didn't want the U.S. saddled  down with &quot;old men&quot; sending young boys into battle. In his  notebook were the names of Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, and many others.  And when war broke out, he turned his back on all his peers and gave the  &quot;key positions&quot; to the young bloods. After the war, he was the  Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State in the Truman  administration. The Marshall Plan was not named after Marshall Dillon in  Gunsmoke! He created the means for building up all of Europe after World  War Two. He was virtually worshipped by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower.  And like Einstein and William Randolph Hearst, was an admirer of Gandhi!  The biographer does not try to make any points. Does not try to hammer any  &quot;message&quot; home. He does what all really good biographers do and  simply tells you what happened in this man's life. Anyone interested in  U.S. history can read all the books about the &quot;pop heroes&quot; such  as Patton and Eisenhower, but they won't get the entirety of the picture  until they deeply know about this man. Churchill also worshipped Marshall.  Thank God one person spent enough time and energy to write about him. Thank  you.

Whether you think you are Napolean or  &quot;exceptional&quot;, you can afford to be average according to Dr. Low.  This was all stated way before Drs. Ellis and Beck decided they were the  new scientists of mental health.  Dr. Low created the  cognitive-behavioral<br />approach way before these gentlemen.

All of them are not &quot;user friendly&quot;. The authors assume that one knows certain areas of knowledge and has an I.Q. of 500.  An exception is Milton Friedman's  &quot;Freedom to Choose&quot;.  The other is &quot;Why Government Doesn't  Work&quot;.  I'm voting for this gentleman again.  He ran for president in  1996.  And now he will again in 2000. This is a must read.  You simply must  read this book.  It is essential for yourself, your family, your  neighborhood, and your country.  WHY? Harry would help the homeless. Harry  would help the poor. Harry would help the elderly and handicapped. Harry  would help you. If government would please get out of the way and we could  all do as John Lennon sang &quot;Come together&quot;. This book is  absolutely brillant.  While reading it, you will realize what a dream world  we have fabricated for ourselves in thinking that we are helping our fellow  man.  As a presidential candidate, we are only saying what John Lennon also  sang, &quot;All we are saying, is give Harry  a chance (or words to that  effect).&quot;  This book is simple, concise, and illuminating.  I am sure  that the reader of this review considers themselves a good person.  I would  like to think that I am.  Then buy this book and question your assumptions  which Harry deals with in this book.  That more police will reduce crime  and make it safer for your children.  That only the government can help the  poor because nobody else will.  That drug laws will keep our children off  the streets.  That a strong military will keep our country safe from  foreign threats.  Since this book was published, the four countries with  the LEAST amount of poverty have the  LEAST amount of government.  The  United States, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Switzerland.  They are also the  most prosperous in the world.  Why? Read this book.  It's not long.  245  pages. And it's highly understandable.  Put in a few reading hours (3?) and  you will be more politically aware than 99% of the population. AND, you can  relax during the coming election. Because all of the politician's nonsense  will still not be understandable simply because it was never intended to  be.  It was marketed to sell. Buy this book, vote for Harry, and then enjoy  life.  My best wishes.rs (3?) and  you will be more politically aware than 99% of the population. AND, you can  relax during the coming election.

Anybody can write a self-help book if they have a double-digit I.Q. and periodic hallucinations.  Oh!  And a degree from a good dog trainer with a fancy name.  And manic- depression also helps.  This guy has none of this. And I do believe he is wearing a crew cut?  He's marvelous!  Simply marvelous!  The cover of the book looks like an  Army manual. On the cover, it states &quot;No Bull&quot;, &quot;No  Frills&quot;, &quot;No Hype&quot;.  And Khan even reduces Time Management  to 1 or 2 pages.  I thought that this book was just another come-on.  But  why not give it a try. Right?  I was boiling with anger.  I tried one of  his &quot;instant remedies&quot;.  And my anger was completely gone in less  than 90 seconds!  Autosuggestion?  No.  I understood.  To understand what  I mean, buy this book.  Khan has gotten rid of all the &quot;peacock  garbage&quot;.  I don't think he has really contributed one original idea  to the book.  But what he has done, and so brillantly, is distilled all the  ancient self-help books (99% garbage), extracted the 1% that works, and put  it together for you to work with and study with.  Benjamin Franklin's  Autobiography was one of the first truly helpful self-help books (books  that can help people). Either Steve Jobs or Picasso said that &quot;true  artists don't copy art, they steal it&quot;).  Khan has done so in such a  brillant fashion.  117 techniques for the new millinium.  All condensed  into &quot;pill form&quot;.  Now I can get rid of all my other self-help  books with their &quot;neat&quot; diagrams and convulescent but impressive  theories.  Maybe a &quot;psychobabble yardsale&quot;.  This is nothing more  than less than a Boy Scout Manual for Sanity. Buy it and put it under your  pillow!	1999-12-20

I was presribed Valium for 30 years.  It's beneficial effects rarely last more than 4 months. But I trusted my doctors.  The effects have been devastating and disastrous for me and my family. I have suffered from  severe depression for 30 years and finally turned to alcohol to reduce what  is commonly called the &quot;Benzo Blues&quot;.  Valium has also been  referred to as &quot;Blue Death&quot;.  When I questioned one clinic about  this drug, the reply was, &quot;We must deal with the depression  first!&quot; So they kept me on this dosage for 3 more years while  prescribing Prozac.  Obviously, this did not help except to deaden my brain  worse.  So they doubled the Prozac.  That did not work.  So they quadrupled  the Prozac to it's maximum!  In desperation, I called my church, and they  said to follow my doctor's orders so that I was even more convinced that  what I was doing was right.  Finally, the climax came and I started going  on alcoholic benders to alleviate the depression.  Now, the clinic stated  that I must take the Valium and Prozac in order to treat my disease of  alcoholism!  I finally ended up in a psychiatric hospital for one week.  A psychiatrist there told me that what had been going on was insane.  That  she has been desperately trying to get the elderly off of Xanax and Valium  which their doctors had addicted them to.  If you are a counselor, or  simply a  concerned citizen who is definitely concerned  about crime in  this country, you simply must read<br />this book and discover what the  medical profession and the pharmaceutical companies have been doing in  order to make money.  I am now under a slow  withdrawal program with a  qualified psychiatrist and therapist.  But I am taking care now of my own  medical care in all regards.  Readers, please  refer to the PDR also  (&quot;Physician's Desk Reference&quot;) and read all the side effects of  all  drugs that you are taking.

Which club?  Which therapy?  Which religion?  It seems that we have to do so much, in order to alleviate ourselves from something so constant and simple.  Namely,  suffering.  We need to join clubs.  To join religions.  To go through  initiations.  To afford a therapist. The author of this book is my Guru.  I  give no  weight to any other material.  I was initiated as his devotee 26  years ago.  The president of the organization that he founded,  Self-Realization  Fellowship, was a direct disciple of his for 21 years  while he was living in our prescence.  I  live near most of their churches.  I have talked extensively with their ministers and monks.  But  Yogananda was and is a well that you  can dip your cup freely from and  drink as much as you will.  One is not seperated from time and space.  His  family is the world.  Credentials and titles do not matter.  This book  is an example of what he taught.<br />Simplicity and the simple fact that one  can reach God on the opposite side of the planet from Self-Realization  Fellowship Headquarters and be a garbage collector in an unknown part of  the world, if one's love for God is intense enough.  I am quite assured  that if one read this little book 100 times and followed it's principles  devotely, one would probably be a greater saint than anyone who lives near  Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters, is a monk or nun of his  organization, or those who knew him personally while he was living.  He is  all of ours.  This book may be all you need!  Others need more  equipment  and training, sorry to say.  This book is very simplistic.  Very  simple. If I were stranded on a desert island, and I only had one book, I  do believe it would be this one. I have all of Yogananda's lessons and  service lectures bounded in my library.  As well as all of his books,  recordings, and the words of his devotees.  And all of the yogic methods  that he taught.  But if one would take a tiny book such  as this, and folow  it with ferverous devotion, I have no doubt that eventually such a one  would go as fast spititually as anyone anyplace and at anytime.

And it is a great contribution to history.  But by his own admission, he may have been the worst of the bunch.  Hatred has a certain energy.  A cerain workability, so to speak.  When you murder, you  feel.  Mind you, I'm not writing from personal experience.  But Speer  admits this.  He simply had no affinity for human tissue.  He admits, in  the book, this non-human aspect to himself.  And quite glibly says that he  was worse than the real minions of hate.  For he didn't feel. Speer was the  archtypal sociopath.  As I sit here and write this review, if someone were  to scream for help, I might simply notice the scream and calmly go back to  my work.  Speer states that he knew nothing of the Holocaust.  His writing  is very  truthful and I have no doubts that this is true. But then he  states that he would have been aghast.  Not because of the brutality of  what was done.  But, as he admits, his reason was only worse.  The waste of  labor in slave labor.  The man used a very common ploy.  One used many  times.  By being brutally blunt about his own guilt, we come to defend him.  Let's grow up a little.  The man is now dead and he would have done the  same thing.  Simply because he was right about himself.  He viewed a world  of objects and not people.  I'll save my compassion for Hitler whose father  brutally beat him so bad that he would urinate in his pants each time  before the act was even done.	1999-06-09

Many years ago, I saw a young girl sitting on a park bench reading this book.  I thought &quot;uh-oh!&quot;  Chogyam Trungpa was considered one of the  greatest meditation masters in American Buddhism.  The Karmapa approved of  him totally.  He was a brillant man who understood the inhibitions and  neurosis of Westerners possibly better than any teacher who has taught  Tibetan Buddhism in the West.  He helped me a great deal.  I no longer  became embarrassed about being a human being. His books are and were great.  But sadly enough, we have to face facts.  I have talked to many many people  in the last twenty years who knew him.  His conduct was, to say the least,  deplorable.  He constantly violated four out of the five Buddhist precepts.  Buy the book. All of Trungpa's books and his teachings were  fundamentally kind and compassionate.  Just do what the Dalai Lama  suggests.  Be wary with any personal teacher.  Best of luck.	1999-05-15

Very reluctantly.  The Dalai Lama is a religious leader.  But also a political one.  And his biography is really quite wonderful. But it has serious drawbacks.  First  of all, the Dalai Lama has become some sort of &quot;pop hero&quot;.  Everybody, even Buddhists, keep quoting the Dalai Lama.  He's on the  &quot;top ten&quot; list of good guys. And this is a fun read.  But in a  way, people just don't understand.  There are thousands like him in Tibet.  Some, most likely, more kinder than he is.  And they are, at this moment,  being tortured, jailed, and killed. It's not the Dalai Lama that is great.  It is the Tibetan people. Everytime one of those bodhisattvas dies, it  affects us all.  From  an Einsteinian viewpoint, everthing is connected.  And when one of these guys dies, it affects us all.  There's a little more  smog in the air.  And eveybody is a little less friendly.  The book is  great.  We learn a  lot after having read it.  The first chapters are fun  and adventurous.  But it's the last chapters that need special attention.  I won't cite atrocities, this is a book review, but everytime one of those  ET's in Tibet are tortured, jailed, or killed, we lose something of  ourselves.  They are people who have dedicated their lives to help us!  So  perhaps we should venerate the Dalai Lama a little less and venerate many  of the spiritual masters in Tibet who are saints.  The theory that this is  all a good thing because Buddhism will come to the West is a bit of a  cop-out.  Buy the book.  Read the book.  And pay attention to the last  chapters.  And then write out check to the Tibet House in New York which is  devoted to help stop the total extinction of Tibet.  Amazon books, I  believe, would never allow me to give out their address.  This would start  a precendent for everbody to ask for donations in their book reviews!  Anyway, the book is great.  The Dalai Lama is a great writer.  He manages  to place you with him as we escape Tibet and dangerously travel to India.  His impressions of Nehru and the Pope, as well as Father Thomas Merton, are  especially insightful.  It's an exciting book. And fun!  The man is totally  honest and humble.  So we are allowed to take his place as he objectively  describes what happens to him from birth.  He manages to act as an  objective reporter.  So we can see through his eyes. And we learn a great  deal about the mysteries of Tibet.  I recommend it highly.lace you with him as we escape Tibet and dangerously travel to India.   His impressions of Nehru and the Pope, as well as Father Thomas Merton, are  especially insightful.

Lawrence	Books	5	93	98	N	N	The Best on Lawrence	In my opinion, this is the very best biography on Thomas Edward Lawrence.  Brillantly written.  Beautifully researched.  A truly in-depth study of a very great man.  Another biogragraphy, a very good one in fact, simply  leaves out Lawrence's sado-masochistic proclivities when he joined the  ranks after his  departure with Churchill.  This is the very best.  And the author put such hard work into it that it is  amazing.  It's a masterpiece.  My only criticism of this book is that the author definitely dislikes the  film version of Lawrence's escapades  in Arabia beacause it supposedly  portrayed him as a bloodthirsty maniac.  Yet in Lawrence's &quot;Seven  Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, he did state that we killed and killed and killed  as was displayed in the movie. So, whether true or not, that's history.  Nevertheless, this is and will probably be the  definitive book on  Lawrence.  Mack put so much effort into this work that I believe this will  outrank all future attempts. Very well-written.  And despite Mack's  pschiatric inquirie's into Lawrence's nature, they don't diminish the book  in any way.  So may biographies have been ruined by psychiatric  interpretations.  This book is not one of them.  And the author writes  compassionately and truthfully so that you know you would like the  biographer if you met him on the street. A rare biography that is both  user-friendly and very deep.  A difficult task indeed. And their is ample  evidence that Lawrence had sexual sado-masichistic tendencies after his  torture by the Turks.  The author does not dispare us of Lawrence's faults  in anyway.  Yet we are still left with the portrayal of a kind,  compassionate, man who was indeed, selfless. A great biography about a  great man.	1999-05-15

I think we all want to be happy.  This course is not really Buddhist or even a course of meditation. It's a road map to happiness and great peace.  It's a road map home.  You can do the meditations in a chair.  Or you can  sit in a variety of positions.  It is asked that you meditate for 45  minutes daily.  But, on certain days, you can only meditate for a few  minutes if you so choose.  I feel it's really best to start on the road to  happiness with this couse rather than finding a teacher or a group.  I've  been that route many times, and I have always been left unfulfilled.  This  is simply a wonderful couse.  It custom-tailors the practice of happiness  tailored for you.  It is for beginners as well as for advanced practioners.  My instructor has completed a nine-month retreat in this meditative  tradition.  Several three-month retreats.  Is the director of a meditation  program in New Hampshire.  Has a master's degree in Western and Eastern  Psychology.  On and on.  I follow the guided meditations with the tapes  being played.  You can do this or pracice without the tapes after you've  listened to them several times.  I prefer the tapes on.  Once again, this  course allows you to custom-tailor your practice for you.  You don't get  this by joining a group. All these options.  It is hard work.  But it's  also good to be alive and not asleep. Each meditation on side two of each  tape, modifys or builds on the prededing one. You are really creating your  own practice.  Then if you want to join a group or find a personal teacher,  fine. But you will be in the driver's seat.  And with this course and the  resorces that the workbook provides you, I'm beginning to wonder if this is  absolutely necessary.  I write to my instructor after each lesson.  And she  replies.  I am also asked to contact her if there are any special problems  with my practice.  Using either letter or cassette tape.  I use mail.  I  really love this course.  It's just so concise.  And each tape is  user-fiendly.  The talks are very inspiring, and the guided meditations  gently glide you into the practices.  If you really want happiness based on  a 2,500 year study of the mind and the causes and the practices of  happiness, here it is.  Put the workbook under one arm, the cassette binder  under the other, and follow the yellow brick road to happiness.  There is  one catch.  It is hard work.  And you do have to stick with it.

People now seem more concerned about &quot;recovery politics&quot; than about the addict or alcoholic who suffers greatly.      Is alcoholism a disease?  The author states  emphatically that it is not.  A.A. states that it it is.  It is.  The  American Heritage Dictionary states disease as &quot;lack of ease&quot; and  &quot;trouble&quot;.  Of course, we could state that wife-beating is a  disease.  This focusing on semantics does no one any good.  Especially the  addict.  This is a <br />beautifully written book and a necessary one.  I  would recommend it to all health professionals and families of addicts and  alcoholics as well as addicts themselves.       But it really is only good  for those who do  not believe that their is anything outside themselves  which can help them.  Namely, God or Allah, or Dharma, or man's innate  goodness.  The first step, that one is powerless over alcohol, and the  second which states  which states that something &quot;other&quot; can only  help us recover from alcohol comes down to whether one does believes in  something besides scientific materialsm or not. Oddly enough, the author, a  proponent of cognitive therapy, believes there is not while  cognitivists  have been accused by the scientic community as indulging in very  unscientific pracices that have not been proven by science in any capacity.         The big debate, which the author discusses in this book, also staes  that A.A. is a religion  and not a spiritual path.  Here he is wrong.  Both  yoga and Zen are spiritual paths, but not religions.  Yet they do work with  a &quot;Higher Power&quot;.  God in the first case and &quot;Big Mind&quot;  in the second.  Zen Buddhism and Hinduism, on the otherhand, are religions.   Anybody can belong to a group which practices zen and yoga while belonging  to any church they choose.  Why can't people who  go to A.A?      When all  is said and done, Trimpey will have helped A.A. greatly.  In the book, many  ofthe abuses claimed against A.A. are indeed true.    That's why this book  needed to be written.  For members of Alcholics Anonymous who have faith in  their Higher Power as well as for athiests and agnostics who simply want to  get off drugs.  The former will see the faults in their organization  which  will stengthen their faith in a Higher Power and lessen their demands that  A.A. is the answer. It is for some people.  But not for Jack nor I.       Trimpey, based on cognitive therapy principles, claims that A.A. is  damaging.  No. This is from his viewpoint and his religion which  is  scientific materialism.  But what applies to him does not apply to all.       Despite these shortcomings, read the book. Then go to an A.A. meeting and  meet a lot of nice people.  Many of which believe in God and simply do not  care if Johnny Carson, David Letterman, and others gave up alcohol without  A.A.<br />Bill Butler at WBu6139496@aol.com	1999-05-11

Found only solid gold.  This book is  incredible.  Atheism postulates a &quot;peaceful nothingness&quot; after  death.  And since  this contradicts Newton's second law, the law of  conservation, it too is a religion.  In Buddhism, no matter how good a life  you have lived, you may be reborn as a hell being if you die a violent  death.  In Christianity, if you are a wonderful  human being, you will go  to eternal hell if you are not a Christian.  And if you are a rotten apple,  don't worry.  If you believe in Jesus then  He will save you and eternal  happiness will be yours.  Where can we turn?  Existentialism?  Humanitarianism?  Alcoholism?

Study comparitive religions  for another 10.  Meditate for 20 more years.  Get a Ph.D in science.  And  finally, you will most likely end up saying, &quot;Yes, now I  understand&quot; after reading and studying this book.  It took me 30  years of meaningless searches  and trips, and yogis, and psychologists, and  scientists to find this book.  It was like finding the Holy Grail.  The  only thing bad about this book is that, once read, you will always come  back to it.  Always.  Even if you don't like what reality spells out for  us.  Truth can be very addicting.  It is like quicksand.  You can get stuck  in it.  And the more you struggle, the harder it becomes to get out of it.  I recommend this book highly.  So beautifully  written.  So  enlivening.  And a bit earth-shattering.  Because the pieces fit.  The  notes rhyme.  And you grimace as you say, &quot;Yes. That rings true with  everything I've ever experienced, read, or lived through.&quot;  Enough  said.  Buy the book if you are one to open Pandora's box.
