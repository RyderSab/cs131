The protagonist Anna, her son-in-law, her neighbor, the gay couple Jack and Stuart--each of these people has seemingly reached the perpetual state of \\"unfazedness.\\" Certainly, there are moments when each is upset, but these moments pass and they soon become people who will tolerate everything that reaches them, as if the other side of the coin, intolerance, is an absolute to be shunned. This feel-good, but sometimes destructive, mindset is manifested most strkingly in everyone's regard for the granddaughter Flynn. She is typically spoken of in terms that are somewhat offbeat, but complimentary. Even Publishers Weekly describes her as \\"remarkable.\\" For this reader and reviewer, Flynnie was weird, first and foremost, and there is sufficient family history in the novel to caution that real help should have been the order of the day for this young girl. I found Manfredi's character relationships of interest, notwithstanding the faults of the individuals, mostly because they are built, oddly, not on mutual discovery of understanding, but mutually passive tolerance.	2004-03-17

Yet I suspect this has little to do with the author and much to do with his publisher who is pushing to get another book by this big money-maker out the door. If you're reading, publisher, sit back for awhile and let the man write a great tale as we all know he can. In this story, composing a summary in one's mind of what will happen to the main character Clay Carter is all too easy almost from the very beginning, and that shouldn't be.

In this case the component is the subject matter itself: Jesus Christ's bloodline and the suppression of documents that suggest a woman should be heading up the Church in Rome. Other components I found weak. Main characters, for this reader, remained paper-thin. The French police captain and his second-in-command revealed a hackneyed relationship. The story attempted to duplicate the frenetic pace of some movie thrillers, but its effort fell short because its energy to accomplish this was consumed by format rather than story: more than 100 chapters, plus a pro- and epilogue, and too many of them unfolded in an escaping vehicle. Additionally, because much of the story has its action in France, its appears author and editor thought it necessary to pepper the text with countless French lines. A little of this goes a long way for readers who do not speak French. Although I finished the story, early-on something began to nag at me and it remained to the very end. This is a generous time of year and so I've awarded it 3 stars.	2003-12-30

The blatant lies and distortions by numerous conservatives in positions of governmental and commercial power, all in an unashamed attempt to manipulate us smaller folk so they can have their way, must be fought with vigor and ridicule. It's likely someone cautioned Franken that, by soing so, he would be no better than those he has written about. And thinking this, I was reminded of a &quot;Taxi&quot; episode in which character Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) is given the ugliest of hairdos by an arrogant, high-pricing coiffeur (Ted Dansen). When she is about to dump a bowl of hairdressing goo on his head, she is stopped by Alex Rieger (Judd Hirsch) who says she would be stooping to Dansen's level and that she is better than that. But Louis DePalma (Danny DeVito) says he &quot;aint better than nobody&quot; and promptly upturns the bowl on Dansen. And that's how Franken comes across: he doesn't consider himself to better than anyone. He'd simply like everyone to know how they are being lied to from the other side. And he's done it. Thank you, Al.	2003-12-23

It brings together Cerise, a singer brutalized by a lover, and Beck, a Kansas youth and Francophile with a talent for painting, who has fought in the war, deserted, and is damaged, emotionally and spiritually, by the conflict's horrific realities.<br />An autobiographical foreword to the story rather assures the reader their love will triumph. But in unintended ways, the foreword also may negate, to at least a minor degree, a reader's attention to this same love's precariousness, an extended condition of special significance because of the environment that is marked by ongoing and ever-closer, horrible destruction. (Perhaps an afterword would have been better.)<br />As unconditional as the devotion of this couple becomes to each other, it cannot be afforded a guarantee in the face of circumstances neither Beck nor Cerise has previously experienced. Thus, the frangible state of their love soon becomes manifested, most often by  weeping. &quot;Are these tears of joy?&quot; is what this reader asked himself.<br />In a stable and peaceful environment, such welling-up of the eyes might cause others to question, &quot;Is this couple losing it? Are they about to tumble over the edge and never return?&quot; But in the midst of a war environment, the reader wonders why they haven't already lost it and what admirable quality does each possess that successfully fights against the failure of their love, even in the very worst of times. Yes, they are tears of joy. At the same time, however, they speak of fragility; and both characters and reader alike are relieved when Beck returns to the stable heartland of his America and brings along Cerise, as well as others.	2003-04-10

But in Matthiessen's tale in which each chapter is told from the perspective of one person, numerous names of brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, cross-breeds and others are given time and again, all the while the focus is kept on just who is Mr. Watson and what makes him tick. There may be some confusion here, but it's of the type that comes from sitting on the porch across from someone who is telling you his or her story, and you realize there isn't a need to always interrupt and request the person identify every incidental person who shows up in the tale. Rather, you are taken in by the great story overall and by the teller, who turns out to be quite an interesting character himself. This is the case with `Killing Mister Watson.' Moreover, this maze of characters and their various contrasting views on Edgar Watson tend to further illuminate the geographical flavor of South Florida which Matthiessen describes as `labyrinthine.' Just as it is easy to become lost among the mangroves and the rivers, so is it equally difficult to decipher the truths and falsehoods of the folks who lived there around the turn of the twentieth century and knew Mister Watson. I liked this book. I liked it a lot.	2002-12-06

Even if that youngster has achieved some manner of celebrity status, it must pose special problems for an older generation to write accurately and insightfully about its focus. And if that celebrity status has resulted from that youngster's caring humanity and unselfish acts in the midst of an ongoing life-threatening disease, writing the story must prove all the more difficult. Yet author Marvin Bartlett, anchor for the Bluegrass Region's Fox affiliate, has successfully overcome those difficulties in telling the story of Jarrett Mynear, an extraordinary young Kentuckian who, when faced with a disease that would eventually steal him from all those who loved him, chose to better the emotional and mental well-being of others who suffered like himself. Bartlett knows the story is so strong and moving that editorial commentary from himself is minimalized, and he maintains his discipline even in the secondary matters. For example, when campground owners hosting a group of children, all of whom are seriously ill, deny them the fun of shooting at each other in a squirt gun battle because these owners abhor war and violence, Bartlett merely reports the fact, confident that his readers will shake their heads. This is the story of a remarkable boy, and reading it, I suspect, will bring some relief to those distressed, and joy to all. Despite the sadness.	2002-12-03

That is this story's plotline. Too bad it never gets exciting. The writing is downright flat and it seems as though the author cannot resist the urge to contrive a scene and indeed the whole book. Main character Combs travels across parts of America with his guitar and several people he meets tell him that he has talent. By the end of the story Combs has retraced his route and collected all these people, and together they go to New Orleans and open up their own club, which also serves the perfect french fry (Billy Bob Thornton already ran the fry in to the ground). Even the smallest detail doesn't escape the urge to contrive, as when a derelict falls asleep in a house full of cats. But there is only one cat that will sleep with this derelict, and we are told that it's name is Hobo. Need more be said?	2002-10-27

Published in 1954, Evan Hunter's novel is set in an urban vocational school of all boys. Today, almost fifty years later, it remains not just an excellent read, but also a worthwhile one-especially when it is read in conjunction with SPINE, a more contemporary novel of teachers struggling with students and the school system of an isolated rural town. In the latter work-a creation of this reviewer-the power and authority of the teacher in the classroom has been virtually eliminated (though seldom admitted), and no administrator would ever utter the words that Hunter's principal stresses to his faculty: &quot;The teacher is boss, remember that!&quot; Nor would those same administrators of today play the hardball of the JUNGLE's head man and insist on payment by parents for the destruction of school property by their sons and daughters. And how many modern-day parents are there who don't view the entire school as something they cannot entirely trust? Who may even regard it less a friend to their progeny and more an enemy? These and other contrasts are often starkly apparent if one reads both novels. Just as are other items that are the same today as they were midway through the previous century. In fact, one of these may even help to determine when teachers began to lose the authority of their position. Again, consider Hunter's school principal. When a student levels a charge at his English teacher, the story's protagonist, principal Small accuses his employee Rick Dadier of being a racial bigot, and he does so without first listening to the other side of the incident. Read one, read the other. Gain a little more insight about the world of education.	2002-09-17

But it's also been my experience that this doesn't matter much if the ideas are strong, explicated, argued, and finally illustrated to some degree in the story itself-as though the body of man and his external trappings matter not at all when the subject is his thinking and its direction. And that's what Pears has done. Among the items that are aired in discussion, Pears's most favored seems to be that Blind Faith will gain no one that coveted point beyond this earth; that Understanding is the vehicle that brings about success; that it is the Search for the Truth that counts, not unquestioned devotion to an old bible. In view of the rise of Christian fervor in this country and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere, the book achieves greater significance than first meets the eye, as Pears intertwines a trio of stories focusing on an equal number of men who reside in the same region of the planet, except there are hundreds of years between them and the historical junctures are important: the fall of the Roman Empire, the Black Plague, World War II. All points during which men's faith and understanding were tested..<br />Although I enjoyed this book, because there are no chapter headings-only space between changes of character and time-it took some effort getting used to the transitions. At the same time, many of the transitions are to be appreciated as the author thought to link the character from the previous scene. A good book. Especially so for a torpid mind.	2002-09-11

Make no mistake about it, I enjoyed reading this story told in first person by the daughter of a snake-handling, fundamentalist preacher who exhibits more lunacy than religion. And all the characters are well drawn and very believable. But as did several other reviewers, I too found the ending to be disappointing, even jarring. It seems to me the author, near the end, lost sight of the Grace Shepherd she developed through the first 250 pages, a young girl and later a woman who was intelligent, reflective, and often independent in her thinking. She would not have returned to the church of her father and its dangerously ridiculous routines.  More likely an ending would have been the angry, stalking return of her Southern-boy lover from whom she stole several thousand dollars.	2002-09-07

Set in a small town of rural Maine, this story focuses on about a dozen of its citizens, young and old, most of whom work at or frequent its somewhat greasy spoon of a diner; and it is not an overstatement to say that the novel's appeal and strength derive from their attentive development by their creator. One needs only to read to a page midway before the key feeling hits, the feeling that you, too, are in the diner, and that you could easily contribute some dialogue of your own to the conversations, simply because you really are getting to know these people. Thus, this reviewer is in agreement with others who applaud the book's numerous characterizations. But I disagree with those reviewers who see the story's ending as rushed and indicative that Russo was unsure how to bring an end to his story. More, I suspect that a fine piece of craftsmanship was overlooked by these readers. Remaining outside the diner and community would make it appear that the ending is rushed and that the author is guilty of a terribly impatient act. But immerse oneself in the verisimilitude and the descriptive word becomes \\"surprising.\\" And isn't that what the ending is to every character? Isn't that what similar events are to real people in real small towns? When Russo introduces the characters germane to the ending, its possiblity comes into play then and there. Moreover, the author switches tense from past to present in the chapters that empathasize these same people, as if to say that while there is lesson in the first, there is warning in the second. To miss this suggests a complacency of perusal.	2002-08-25

Beginning at the bottom: imagined early civilizations from another planet appear with the expected conniving, slaughter, sacrifices of young boys and girls, only to find themselves joining with barbarian forces to defend against invaders from another planet. Who tells this story? A young man who sympathizes with the communists in turbulent times, the male lover of a couple who meet secretly one day here, the next day there, the third day somewhere else, and on it goes. But pull back further (it requires no effort) and you see that it is one of two sisters who commands the entire story and its flow, and it is the relationship of these sisters from life to death during the Depression years and through WW II that this Atwood novel is truly about. It is about them and basically three men who were influential in their lives: their father, the on-the-run red sympathizer, and a wealthy Canadian industrialist who was too quick with approval for the Germans. \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is not only the title of the book for sale; it is likewise the title of the novel within, but together they invite speculation as to the symbolic meaning: who or what is the real blind assassin? The layers must come together and be artfully explained, and so they are, wonderfully so. Nevertheless, when the author of the sci-fi stuff asks himself why he writes such [\\"garbage,\\"] with some relevance this reader wondered, not so much why it was there at all, but questioned the reason for so much of it. It was tedious. So, too, were the trysts.	2002-06-26

But the contributions of an Appalachian environment on actors and actresses is another matter. Put another way, the industry there is not so big that it can keep out unwanted influences. And so the Bellers, a familiar family name, are everywhere; and although they could show up in many forms, in this story they appear frequently as \\"trash-Bellers.\\"  One of these, Crystal Beller, is the first to be murdered, and she is of immediate interest because others say of her that she can become anyone in her desire to be a starlet. Of course, such a statement is really doubly interesting, in addition to being a nice device to spread the mystery, because it suggests that those saying it may be capable of the same subterfuge. Written in the form of an epistolary novel, letters from a recovering alcoholic father/leading man to his young daughter, this novel introduces numerous characters in order to confound the deductive reader, and each succeeds in the mission if the reader lends to it his or her own contribution of subtle thinking. At the same time, the form often denies the extended description of a character here or there-you wouldn't expect Matt Logan to fully detail someone to his little girl. It also denies the more evocative descriptions of the beautiful Carolina mountains and that, perhaps, is a fault. But overall, the story runs true from beginning to end and was an enjoyable read.	2002-06-18

Scenes are short; much like a snapshot in some instances. And when they end, it isn't hard to imagine their central character staring off into space and holding that look for a few seconds before cutting to the next short scene or commercial. Diction is uncomplicated. Dialogue is clipped, typical of most exchanges on the televised soaps. The connecting sentences between bits of conversation likewise are short, mostly simple declarations. Internal monologue is minimal. As for the book's characters matching up with soap people, there's wife Susan who does the prerequsite \\"sticking one's nose into other people's business,\\" her husband who falls to the wiles of his secretary; a disruptive daughter with sex on her mind, plus Swanson, the necessary slimeball who has a thing for dead people and teenage boys. Step aside from all this and the soap analogy falls apart. I mean, I like Jeff, his wife, Maryann, and poor Beetle; and I haven't wanted to know any of television's soapsters since Joanne Tate and Stu Bergman. Moreover, I never once got the feeling that these folks had money coming out their wazoo, which is otherwise standard. The women aren't all dolled up 24/7 and one gets the idea that the men actually do work, rather than pretend to it, as is the case with the network soaps. Readers who see this short novel as a story about a woman whose life is suddenly in turmoil and who seeks remedy through her faith might want to loosen up on their attachment to that theme in order to enjoy the comedic value arising from the underwritten structure. There are more than a few instances which suggest that the author has an even greater sense of humor than she was willing to display in this, her first novel. For example, I doubt it was any random choice that the author gave to the story's minister, a man who is busily boinking the women in his congregation, the name of Pastor Bob. And underwriting the name of a man of the cloth IS funny!the author gave to the story's minister, a man who is busily boinking the women in his congregation, the name of Pastor Bob.

Well, friends, of course. There is no real sense of conflict with either of these women to suggest other possibilities. Problems they have, certainly, but the author translates none of these into real conflict. And for this reader, a male, it made me take less of an interest in these women than I would have preferred. I wanted some depth with moments of internal agonizing. For Annabelle, the task, I believe, would have been especially difficult to accomplish, if only because, for much of the story, she must deal with an anal-retentive boyfriend named Del, who was too often a reminder of another anal-retentive character married to Thelma in the film  Thelma and Louise. Thus, Thelma was often popping up when I was reading about Annabelle, and the one is more captivating than the other. Still, the theme of this story is one of establishing friendships among disparate human beings, and my objections, more personal than critical, in no way hinder its development. This is a quiet read and should be appreciated as such.	2002-02-01

Toomey Spooner is just one more feckless family member, despite holding a degree in English Literature from a big university. So it's a question of how really feckless can he be. Enough in his own mind, in any case, as well as in his girlfriend's; and deciding to do something about it at thirty-nine years of age, he campaigns for mayor of his Kentucky hometown where there is only one high school, suggesting that the position may not be much in either decision-making or recompense. His faithfully despicable opponent once sodomized a goat and although Toomey knows this, he refrains from letting it out to the populace, seeming to not consider at all why anyone with such information would not use it in order to keep such depravity from settling in the offices of government. But it's consistent with Toomey's forgiving ways as he allows a buffoonish wife-abuser still gunning for his ex-mate to attend his evening wedding festivities, an extraordinary affair which erases all villains from the story. While the English Lit major of Toomey Spooner raises some questions with this reader about the character's judgment, at the same time it's the spark of this story told in the first-person. Wonderfully fresh and evocative descriptions pop up everywhere and their abundance, along with the occasional digression, help to literarily (not literally) duplicate the pace of Kentucky small-town life. Overall, a good story and worth the time.	2001-12-23

A favorite then, and I find that time has not diminished my appreciation for this great novel. This is a story of 'puts' and 'calls' and it has nothing to do with Wall Street. In a way this is the genesis of other stories.<br />...There is uninhabited land in a northern clime and a man is put amidst it. Isak clears land, tills the soil, constructs buildings. He has a call for a woman and Inger is put there. So too is a cow, then a bull, a goat, and a pig. There is a call for additional buildings and more clearing and tillage. A call for a saw mill. A call for irrigation and an engineer is put there. Children are put in the woman and two of these are sons. Eleseus is of different temperament from Sivert and his father and is called to town, to an office. Copper has been put in the land and Geissler and others call upon the landowner Isak to buy so that it might be extracted. Poles are needed for the telegraph. Neighbors arrive and with it a capitalistic thinking, but in the end it is those who work the soil who are truly lauded; and that all the artifacts that come about with development of towns are merely what they are called and worth only what a man will pay for them, unlike the soil. Isak is well described as 'a barge of a man' because of his size and scope of labor, yes, but also because all that follows in the rest of us might be argued as contained in his life of doings and in those of his wife as well.<br />Before there were thrillers, courtroom dramas, potboilers, and romances, there was literature like this.

This is a courageous woman and the story told in simple terms proves it time and again.	2001-12-01

But one item not overly worked is the intensity of one man, John Harrison, to not only create, build, and improve his marine chronometer over a lifetime, but to make each example truly aesthetic, a device beautiful to behold at first glance, for both the casual and investigative eye. Moreover, the beauty of each device and the appreciation it can spawn extends beyond one's vision. For example, to lubricate the mechanism, its gears and most other parts made of wood, Harrison selected a tropical wood that secretes its own oils. Other lubricants at the time were of poor quality and soon gummed up the works. Lignum vitae did not. This is a wonderful story, well-told, with just the right stage entrances from more famous figures of the 18th century.	2001-11-20

If e-mail messages have begun to grate, here is a book that will remind you how sweet letterwriting can be and how wonderful a thing it can accomplish...if one only takes the time. 84, Charing Cross, I've concluded, is also the perfect gift for friends with sensitive souls who already seem to have everything. It is also a fine thing to read before turning off the light next to your bed.	2001-11-13

That could be the case with De Soto's theory and recommendation to bring the extralegal sector into the 'alfresco' economies of underdeveloped nations, except if I consider the anecdotal evidence relating to myself and many, many others in this country, it doesn't sound simplistic at all. Certainly a bold, intensive step would be required to register and legalize properties. Many steps, in fact. De Soto doesn't downplay this. Even in a place where it is seemingly impossible to say where property lines should be drawn, there is the suggestion in the book to watch the members of the local canine population who know their borders and those of their masters. Whatever works! No good reason to wait for cultural attrition, to accept slow transformation. A bold step. That's what this book is putting forth to finally energize a great number of countries, and unless someone can successfully hypothesize about a dreadful consequence resulting from such a step, the move should go forward.	2001-11-12

Throughout the first one-hundred pages of this novel I kept wondering why such a great consensus of readers thought it so stuffed with hilarity. If verisimilitude is still a quality to be looked for in fiction, why in the world would I want to have any association with slob extraordinaire Ignatius J. Reilly! Soon enough, the choice wasn't up to me. But it wasn't because of Reilly himself; rather, it was because of all the other characters, each stringently drawn within parameters one would expect of minor characters, but all interacting with Reilly. My empathy with the main character, therefore, resulted not from Ignatius J. Reilly himself, but from the others in the book who gave me reason to appreciate this man. For most of the rest of the story I laughed the same as everyone before me.	2001-11-12

This collection sets most of that concern aside. Each of these incarcerated voices retains an identity despite surroundings that would have it otherwise. Do they speak for all those behind bars? I doubt it. Here introspection is at work, likely the first time for many of these prisoners. It's difficult to believe that so many others, out of control, will ever achieve such a state,or even want to.	2001-11-07

The main character's intended strength is forever applied in his words to others, and these statements are more air than action, so that strength comes out as weakness. One gets the feeling the author, through his main character, is telling off everyone who has annoyed him. What little story there is--a drive-by shooting and the family's life that follows--could have been told in a dozen pages. Sorry, but this book is nowhere.	2001-10-30
