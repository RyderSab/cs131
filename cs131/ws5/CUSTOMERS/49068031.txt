Without belaboring the point, the author successfully showed complex and long lasting changes that result from this miserable experience. The struggle to remain human and compassionate in a situation that called for detachment, depersonalization and the blunting of feelings was clear. The Viet Nam era was for me, an extremely formative event and it is unfortunate that we have remembered so few of its many lessons. In 1968 \\"Stars and Sripes\\" wrote sanitized and erroneous reports of combat, including inflated body counts and the empty hope that the Paris Peace Talks would bring an end to the conflict ~ how similar to the situation out of Iraq today.  \\"They never talk about the cost\\" is Richie's observation.  Will we EVER  have the courage to be truthful about the cost of war, present and into the future?	2005-09-05

Although set in a Catholic Mission, it would be a mistake to pigeon-hole this as a Catholic novel by a Catholic author.  We struggle today with the same questions Querry did ~ vocation vs. job, identity, image, purpose and faith.  Like Querry, it is only by a journey to the seemingly inaccessible darkness will we find the people and the challenges that allow access to redemption and transformation.

I may find out that there were gross misprepresentations of fact but suspect that the book was of sufficient accuracy to be worth the my time.  Anchee Min painted a sweeping portrait of life in the Chinese imperial court with its opulence and varied layers motives and relationships.  Fictionalized or not, it does give insight into the histroy of China and the events and beliefs that have brought it into the present time.

Great promise, but somehow it did not follow through as anitcipated.  The issues are complex and I think that Lehrer did a great job of laying them out.  Experience shapes us immeasureably and often invisibly. How we perceive life events changes as new events enter the equation. No matter how well we believe we have come to terms with the good and the bad in life, no matter how certain we are of ourselves and our relationships, how we ultimately react remains a mystery.  The strength of this book lies in what goes on in the mind of the reader after completing this rather contrived (at least the second half) story.  It would be a good choice for a discussion group as it invites the readers to explore these moral truths as general concerns, but look at their own beliefs and souls.	2004-05-29

Most of the subplots were eventually relevant, although some either needed more connective development or total elimination.  The strength of the novel is in the development of the relationships and we can clearly see the complexity of each individual and their impact on the total picture.

There was  limited focus on the outrage and upset that the election to the Papacy of an unknown, married, former priest undoubtedly would precipitate, but I believe that was deliberate.  The Spirit works effectively in unexpected and humorous ways if only we trust enough to let her into our hearts and structures.

The only possible explanation is that the disconnected, superficial, unspoken, unexplained relationships in this sad family were symbolized in the disconnected, superficial and poorly developed characters, composition and story line.  It has however continued to hang in the back of my mind, inviting me to make my own sense of the many missed opportunities each person had to look honestly at themselves and each other.

And in truth, I did know it, although the details were different enough that I kept reading.  \\"Bees\\" was a a much better book in terms of writing and character development, telling the age old story of making sense of the complexities of life.  Trobaugh's \\"Praise Jerusalem\\" left me with the same sense of almost being memorable, but ending up being more of an also-ran.

Cardinal Thuan's prison experience speaks to the power of God to sustain,to transform  and to empower despite our sense of abandonment. He shares his experience of a personal conection with God in a simple and refreshingly non- pious, non-clerical fashion. Written as a series of 90 short reflections, the reader is not overwhelmed by words and can actually spend time relating it to their own experience.

There is no denying the gifts that Ben Carson was given nor can anything take away from the good he has done, the levels he has achieved.  But this book does not paint him as a very appealing person.  Not particularly well written, this quickly became a tedious series of self-promotions and one wonders if he is as pleased with himself as C. Murphey leads us to believe. The message of the importance of a supportive family and persistence was lost and what could have been an inspirational biography came across as irritating and nearly impossible to relate to.

Unfortunately this was not evident in this book.  None of the characters ever really came to life or reached their hinted at dreams or potential.  Despite some level of vision, insight, independence and drive, no one was able to change  the &quot;fate&quot; that was so often mentioned.  One might argue that this was done deliberately as some commentary on people, society and contemporary literature, but I am not sure this is the case.  Full of repetitious stereotypes and undeveloped ideas, I would never recommend this as an inspiring story of strong women or families.  &quot;Dreaming Waters&quot;, Tsukiyama's latest, is a much better read.	2003-08-21

Instead, Gail Tsukiyama gifts her readers with an honest and balanced portrayal of a family  that transforms the loss of dreams into a  real life that holds meaning.  Each character makes a decision to not allow circumstance to define or limit their spirit or their options, and while not easily or immediately, each is able to become more than they initially expected. As with &quot;Women of the Silk&quot;, we see how each thread, each event, each relationship is connected and has a purpose that contributes to the total fabric. A particularly good reflection on love, family, friendship, emerging insights and importance of entering life and relationships without reservation.	2003-07-28

Situated in pre-WWII China, Gail Tsukiyama weaves the story of individuals emerging into self-awareness within a society that is also emerging into a new sense of self.  Just as the silk worms are transformed into the threads that make up a rich fabric, the women are transformed into a powerful force within the tapestry of a  rich new social order. What was, becomes the foundation of what is to be. In each case, there must be a dying that opens the way for life.  Not all cocoons are used for silk because of their own limitations or the limits of those involved in the process ~ and each woman moves into the future within the framework of their own limits and circumstance.  This is a book that should be read more than once.  Not only does it present an excellent overview of the social-cultural aspects of China in the 1930's but is offers interesting insight into family,friendships, community, human choices and the interplay of the many factors that shape individuals.	2003-07-18

I too am a long term fan of J.F.Freedman, but came away from his latest book disappointed.  While starting out with a good story line, it quickly bogged down in too many words and details that added nothing significant to the plot or character development.

Each, in their own way, achieves a measure of success, although it is likely that Evelyn will be the only one who is ultimately able to recognize and nurture a personal center that will allow her to fully blossom. I would have liked to have seen greater development of at least some of the many significant events and difficulties  that beset this Kansas community.  Possibly this was intentional, allowing the reader to enter into the resolution in a less directive manner.  Laura Moriarity is a promising writer with a knack for protraying the human condition in a positive and hopeful light, emphasizing again the importance of relationship and compassion for each person.	2003-07-05

As Sabine told her nephews, the trick is in the verbal patter and movement that keeps the audience's attention away from what is really going on in front of them, leading them to believe that something out of the ordinary is happening.

What is it that makes us uniquely who we are? What is the difference between becoming more of who we are and changing the essence of our very self? Movement in one sphere of necessity means movement in another ~ what is gained, what is lost?  Not only did Elizabeth Moon give an honest presentation of autism, but invited her readers to consider the role of technology and societal standards in the shaping of human relationships.

People were transformed because they had the time, the space and the invitation to step out of their rather narrowly defined roles, calling forth untapped gifts and insights.  People who not only spoke linguistically different languages but lived equally alien lives came to see that in truth there were countless similarities and opportunities to  tell and to connect their stories.  As other reviewers mentioned, the story line was predictable, the resolution unsurprising.  But the same can be said about every opera, Greek or Shakespearean tragedy.  Maybe a better title would have been &quot;cantus firmus&quot; ~ that fixed melody of the human condition around which the different elements were brought into play.  My greatest regret about the book came from the way it tapped into my ongoing frustration with the truth that as a society we are so unwilling/unable to put aside our illusions and delusions so that we can really honor the goodness that is within each human being. Given the current state of the world, with its emphasis on economic gain, social status and power, it was a timely read.	2003-04-17

I too felt that there were many loose ends, unexplained people and events and an unsatisfactory ending to &quot;the Divine Economy of Salvation&quot;.  A compelling read, but one that left me wondering if I had only approached it with more thought, it would have felt more complete. Could Uppal possibly have intended this to be something the reader personalized ~ leaving the option of filling in the blanks with their own stories of coming to terms with the same issues of choice, identity, transition and growth? Angela the woman, not fully committed to the NOW because of her THEN. Making adult sense of the the family and school relationships and secrets experienced as a child.  As a religious, moving between the habit and secular clothing,her community wondering how to keep their foundational values revelant to the needs of today.  How to integrate the facts of what happened with the truths that the events held, the impact that they had at the time and in the present. Our past is always with us, coming into our life in different ways, with different results; never destroyed, but put to use and reinterred in a (hopefully) better place, leaving us healthier and more integrated.  It is a  somewhat surreal book that makes the reader ponder and for that reason, is of value.	2003-04-05
