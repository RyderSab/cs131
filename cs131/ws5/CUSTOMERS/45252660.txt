Cheryl's writting style, and characters are simply; unbelievable!  This book was packed full of adventures so vivid I felt as though I was right there, part of the story myself, and her characters full of life.<br />This book was a refreshing break from the scene of the ton which seems to me to be goingly popular with historals lately.  Her characters unique and vibrant, the love making scenes hot and steamy (not always found even with otherwise good writters).<br />The hero, Nolan, is haunted by his past as he finds himself besotted with the girl of youthful longings, but she's also his nemesis' daughter.<br />She, Jewel, head strong, full of determination, wiser and full of courage beyond that of many men, finds herself pinned between the man she loves, the past that haunts him, and the realization that all her childhood dreams of the father she never knew would never be, and never had been.<br />And the adventure that ensures will have you up all night reading until you've finished that last page!!<br />You've gotta read this one!  It's a keeper!<br />Thanks Cheryl, for such a great adventure!	2004-03-29

One conversation/senerio would take place for about a 1 1/2 pages, then it would move on to something else for a while, then back to the main characters, then on to someone else who had been in the book previously, but in such an immemerable way that I couldn't remember who it was, then some more new people (or where they???) then back to the main characters....  This constant jumping back and forth made it difficult for me to keep track of the secondary character.<br />I couldn't even read the whole book.  I made it about 1/3 of the way through before I finally decided to take a loss with this one.	2004-03-28

I love Julia Quinn, and enjoyed this book to a degree.  However, I found myself very disapointed in the hero, Phillip.  Firstly, his reaction to Eloise's arrival seemed enterly too odd, even for a man \\"not good with words\\".  He was much too confused about everything.<br />I also especially hated that it seemed that he could actually find himself perfectly happy and content with Eloise as nothing more than a mother by day and his slut by night... Sorry for my bluntness, but this is how it came across.<br />I was also shocked by some of the dialog that passed between them, he was down right mean and aweful to her with some of the things he said, and honestly I couldn't find myself edeared to a man that despite his past, would say such things for a woman whom he, only shortly later, came to realize he was in love with.<br />I did enjoy the opening of each chapter of Eloise's thoughts and writing of the past and how they fit perfectly into the story, and I loved the very end.<br />I hate doing this, I really do, but I must say, unless you're a JQ fan and want to keep up with the going's on of the Bridgerton family, I simply don't recommend this book.  While there were enjoyable parts of this novel, it just simply wasn't what I had expected from her.	2004-02-01

This book marked the end of my need to read all of Julia Quinn's works.  Unfortunatly, this book is at the bottom of my favorite's list of her novels, however, that is not to say it was not worth reading.  I just didn't find the characters and their adventures quite as enduring as I normally do, especially with a Julia Quinn novel.  Although I did find the other two novels that go along with this one, SPLENDID &amp; MINX very enjoyable.  If you're a Julia Quinn fan, I recommend reading it, since all of us who adore her know that some of her charcters will appear as secondary characters in other novels, however, if you've never read a Juila Quinn novel, I suggest skipping over this one and starting with BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN, or THE DUKE AND I.	2002-12-30

I've been waiting, ever so patiently for this novel, and I was not disapointed!<br />I loved the turn of emotions in Colin as he began to see Penelope in a romantic light after having befriended her for years.  Their emotional adventures together was wonderful!<br />It was very refreshing to finally met a heroine that was not the picture of absolute beauty.  Let's be honest, most of us woman are not what society depicts as \\"perfect\\" as many of the heroines in romance novels seem to be.  I loved watching her finally see her dreams come true and the man that she's cared for for so many years finally return her love, and to hell with looking perfect!  It was great.<br />Thanks Julia for another wonderful adventure!!	2002-11-11

I stuggled to make it though the entire book.  The first 300 pages of this novel (3/4 of it) was nothing but interaction between the main characters.  There was literaly NO significant secondary characters.  In my opinion, secondary characters and their friendship/interaction with the main characters is what really makes them real to the reader.<br />I think the only thing that kept me reading was knowing that there was a plot, as explained early in the book, but actually getting to it took the reader almost to the end if the novel!<br />While romance, love, and sex are vital things in a romance novel, in my opinion, ON A WILD NIGHT could have done with a many number less love scenes!  It got sooooo boring not to mention looooong, I actually had to flip through the pages until it ended, they were pointless to the story line and almost exactly the same each time.<br />This is the first Stephanie Laurens novel I've read, and I'm sad to say, it will also be the last.  I was shocked when I read the notes about the auther to discover that she's published 21 such novels!  Wow... I didn't know the talentless could do so well.	2002-08-31

While I did not find TO CATCH AN HEIRESS quite as enduring as Julia Quinn's other novels, this one still gets 5 stars.  Caroline had lots of spunk and personality despite her being thrown from home to home her whole life.  I personally found Blake's turmoil and heartache over his fiancee who passed away a very real and nice (not to mention neccessary) part of the novel.<br />However if this is your first Julia Quinn novel I would suggest perhaps reading some of her other novels to get a better feel for Julia Quinn's writing talent.  I would suggest reading EVERYTHING AND THE MOON & BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN (they can be read in any order, but do go together), or her Bridgerton novels (THE DUKE AND I is the first in this series that can be read in no particular order but do go together as well).<br />But again, I still enjoyed this novel and would definately recommend reading it!	2002-04-22

I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire book!  I loved how light-hearted things were throughout most of the book.  It was rather refreshing reading a romance that was more on the side of pure fun than stiff seriousness.  Although for those who have not read this novel the characters do find themselves in a serious situation at the end.<br />You've just got to read it!  I'm having trouble now deciding weither BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN is now my favorite Julia Quinn novel or if it's still THE DUKE AND I.<br />~*sigh*~  Desisions... desisions...<br />Thanks again Julia!

I'm not quite so sure that I would agree with anyone that the last 50 pages were unnesessary.  I personally enjoyed the book in it's entirety.<br />I look at it this way, you wouldn't believe the stupid things that my husband and I find to argue about and how personally we can take things sometimes.  If we had been using half the sense our mothers gave us when we were born, we would have never gotten ourselves into such messes in the first place.  Like: &quot;I actually believed that spam email was from another woman!&quot;  (This has acutally happened before!!) And my husband would really believe &quot;that annonomous 'someone has a crush on you' was from my boyfriend I keep stashed away under the bed!&quot;  (This too has happened to us.)<br />So, to be honest, I related Dunford's and Henry's feelings during the conflict of the last 50 pages.  I thought it brought added excitement to the book personally.<br />As always Julia Quinn has brought her readers a wonderful book that will have you smiling and giggling for days after you've read the last page.  Her stories are so enduring and funny, you can't help but remember each character as if you really know them and share their dreams, passions, pain, sorrow and laughter.<br />Another MUST read... thanks Julia!	2002-04-10

I had begun reading it on at least three different occations, but never seemed to be able to get past the first two chapters, but wow... once I did, I found myself falling in love with the characters and the plot.<br />I loved the way Anita Mills slowly brought the plot into play thoughout the first few chapters!!!  I found myself liking Elise's father, despite his prejudice thinking, he truely loved his daughter, which made it so hard to really accept that he was guilty of the crimes accused of him.  I found myself constantly wondering if perhaps there would be some twist at the end that would prove him innocent.<br />This was a great book even though it took me a while to get past the first couple chapters(which is why i took away 1 star, it took to long to really capture my attention)... it was wonderful!  I would recommend this book to any fellow historcal romance reader!	2002-04-07

Firstly I found the interactions between Arielle and Daniel lifeless.  The romance just wasn't there, at all.  Needless to say the lovemaking scenes were no better.  As a matter of fact, the first night they made love I had to reread the section because she never exactly explained what they did... had he taken her viginity?  Were they just being intimate without intercourse?  I had no idea even after rereading the scene.  It was very irritating to not know for sure what's going.<br />I was also very confused about Stephen leaving her at the hotel (apparently not planning on coming back) on at least 3 or 4 different occations because he was upset!  What a fickle man.  Who would want that in their life anyway?<br />I also didn't like the bizzar situation of Arielle searching for her fiancee, but falling in love with her &quot;guide&quot; as he became once they set off in the jungles of Nicaragua.<br />None of it appealed to me and quite frankly the only reason I continued to read it after what was a good beginning until they reached Nicaragua, was because I did want to know what happened to her fiancee Caleb.	2002-03-26

I truely, truely liked this book and was very impressed with many aspects of it.  The plot was simply amazing.  There wasn't anything that I didn't like about it.  Claudia Dain weaved many different things into this book, like Lidia's capture by pirates, her seduction and her confused feelings about it, Dan's own turmoil over the turn his life had taken over the past 4 years before Lidia.  I just loved it.  It was all so wonderful!<br />However, her character development just seemed lacking to me.  I didn't find myself really truly relating to and falling in love with the characters until the very very end!... so sad, because it was otherwise such a great novel!  With, by the way, a GREAT ending!!!<br />I hope to see more books from Claudia Dain, perhaps with improved character development?  She truely does have much talent.<br />Overall, still a very good read!  I certainly wasn't disapointed.  I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-03-20

I thought it brought up some interesting issues concerning a very real curcumstance not uncommon during those times.  In today's society the exact same situation would be irrelivant (my husband was born out of wedlock and NO one thinks anything of it), however back then, it quite obviously was the difference between being a member of society and being forced into servitude (and honestly back then many illigitimate children had far worse fates than becoming a servant as Sophie had).<br />I enjoyed this book very much, although yes, I do agree that it perhaps lacked a lot of the spunk that's in her other Bridgerton novels, but I still couldn't put it down until I had read the last page!  Still very excellent and I can't wait until June when her next Bridgerton novel comes out, \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\".  For those of you who don't know, it will be Colin and Penelope... hmmmm... I guess Colin will be eating his words when he said that he wouldn't marry her in \\"An Offer From a Gentleman\\".  ~*giggles*~  I can't wait!!!<br />And I'm starting to gather my own list of suspects as to just who Lady Whistledown is... ~*smile*~  I can't wait until her identity is finally revealed!	2002-02-19

Julia Quinn has, without a doubt, written her way into being my personal favorite author!... a spot that had has been unchanged since I was sixteen years old.  Oh yeah, with each book of hers that I read, I cannot help but admire her more and more!  Such talent, and to think that she began writing just as a passing thought really, it astounds me.  Wish I had that sort of talent bursting at my fingertips.<br />\\"The Duke and I\\" was uncomparibly brilliant!  I think Julia's biggest talent in her writing (and I'm sure most would agree with me here) is her dialogs.  She has the ability to make her characters become real with laughter, tears and joy.<br />Julia is exceptionally good with adding a whole lot of humor into her novels, and this book was no expection... without giving anything away, I MUST say that I laughed for a good 10 minutes strait reading the part where Simon was drunk and trying to explain his feeling while his brain just wouldn't cooperate with him (nor his speech for that matter)... OH SO FUNNY!!!!<br />You've gotta read this book!  You won't be disapointed!  Again, many many thanks to Julia for sharing her talent with us!	2002-02-14

I had been very much so looking forward to reading this book after reading &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, unaware that it was the third in a series, already having started them out of order, I decided to go ahead and read &quot;Just Once&quot; before &quot;Daydreamer&quot;.  I did read through the 3 other reviews here of this book and must say I'm a bit disapointed in them personally.<br />I throughly enjoyed this book, Jemma was very enduring with her strong will, sensibility, and determination, it was quite interesting to see her pair up with Hunter, who, although the book doesn't describe him as such, came across to me as a rather shy man, quite taken with this girls vocal attitude and blunt requests.<br />As for a predicable plot?  Well we all know that when we sit down to a romance novel how the end is going to be... that's the point of reading a romance novel, there are no broken hearts and unfulfilled dreams in the end.  It's nice to excape to such a land every once in a while.  It's how they come over their conflicts and the adventure inbetween that makes the story.<br />I myself loved this book and was very happy to visit Noah once again, and I'm almost happy that I had read &quot;Blue Moon&quot; before hand... knowing that he does have a happy ending despite his scarring accident in the end of &quot;Just Once&quot;.	2002-02-11

Here is another novel that will be staying on my shelf just because I loved it so much!  This was my first Julia Quinn story and I picked it in a rush rather randomly at the book store, and I was NOT disapointed!<br />Julia Quinn has an amazing talent, her characters were so real, as were their andventures and their love for one another.  Not to mention that the story was full of humor.  Laughter and tears were inevitable.<br />This book almost entirely revolved around their love and heartache.  If you're looking for a romance novel that is heavily into the romance (some seem to have all plot and little to no romance) this is a must read!  I do agree with another reviewer that Victoria did perhaps play hard to get too hard, but her heart had been broken for 7 long years, and, frankly, it makes things more interesting when the characters don't behave as we would like them to!!  That's what makes the words on the pages become more than just &quot;words&quot; and somehow weaves itself into a wonderful adventure that keeps you turning the pages to find out what the characters will do next.<br />And awesome book!!  I'm certain I will be rushing to the book store with an aim this time!	2002-01-04

This is the first Lisa Cach book that I have read and I was very impressed with her writing style, characters, and plot.  Lisa Cach cetainly knows how to weave a wonderful story and really bring it to life!  The only reason I have taken 1 star away from my rating of this book is because this book just wasn't for me.<br />In specific I didn't like the constant reference to &quot;The Hand of Destiny&quot;, it got sickening.  The red kingfisher that &quot;led&quot; Anne to the island and helped her companions find her when she was lost was just too unrealistic for me.  And finally, I didn't like the setting either.  I guess jungles and strange native peoples just aren't my thing for a romance novel.<br />But I cannot say this was a bad book simply because of these things.  This book just wasn't for me, but I can certainly see how this could be a wonderful book for those who would enjoy such a setting!

He presents the facts of what it's really like for the animals raised for food, no matter how much those meat lovers may want to deny that this is so.<br />I have read through the negative reviews of this book, hoping to perhaps hear the honest and researched opinions of those who are opposed to vegetarianism, but I found that the negative reviews written here were nothing but non-sense.  Attacks with no real facts or backup!  See, John Robbins had to know his facts and research extensively in order to write this book, so, simply saying that you don't think he is credible isn't proving anything but your own ignorance.  I really do think that people find it easier (as John himself says) to just pretend that what happens to these innocent animals isn't there, whatever makes you feel good about that ground up flesh you're about to take into you body.<br />I have, for my entire life, known of the horrors that are commited upon the animals that humans use for their own purposes.  I grew up on a Wisconsin dairy farm.  Often when people get defensive with me because I'm vegetarian they will tell me that I haven't seen it with my own eyes, how would I know???  Well, I do know, and I'll tell you that the things that I have seen could be enough to at least touch even the hardest of people.<br />But hey, I don't know what I'm talking about because you want to somehow justify the fact that you are a cause of this butality and torture just so that you don't have to make any sacrifies in your life...<br />This book will do one of two things; it will either open your eyes and open your mind and become an important part of your life and that of your family and friends, or it will just be one more thing that you toss aside without considering and just call it non-sense.  I hope not the later because the facts presented in this book is so much more than just &quot;hurting&quot; animals, it really is your health and well being, and I hope that for your own sake that you don't have to see it with you own eyes, as I growing up, in order for you to realize that your health and livlihood really does depend on, at the very least, considering these facts!!!<br />Please, please, please, no matter your current view on the subject, read this book if not for the animals, for yourself and your fellow human beings.I hope that for your own sake that you don't have to see it with you own eyes, as I growing up, in order for you to realize that your health and livlihood really does depend on, at the very least, considering these facts!!!<br />Please, please, please, no matter your current view on the subject, read this book if not for the animals, for yourself and your fellow human beings.	2001-11-21

I have had complaints about the character development with some of Quick's other novels, however, I must say that Harriet and Gideon were so real!!  Harriet was one of the strongest character's that I've ever encountered in any romance novel before!!!  She knew exactly what she wanted and how she felt and didn't let anything stop her.. not once through the entire book!  It was wonderful!!  And Gideon was a wonderful sensitive man who had to learn how to love once again.  His character was one who didn't take things for granted since he had already been throught so much pain and hardship that he really treasured what he did have.<br />The only complaint I had about this book was that the story line was much too predictable, I think she could have done so much more with it, especially with such original and wonderful characters!

As a matter of fact I had started reading it a few months ago and quickly got bored after the first few pages and set it aside.<br />I think there were a few other things that could have been better in this book, I must agree with the other reviewers that said that the pain and turmoil that plaged Clay just really wasn't there or felt deep enough by the reader... although I will admit that she did an excellent job at the end!!!  I loved it!!  It had me in tears and completely made up for where, in my opinion, it had been lacking else where.	2001-11-10

I read through the other reviews here, and all bring up interesting points and really just goes to show that not everyone is going to love the same book, however I do disagree with all the negative comments.<br />I'm VERY glad that I did not read these reviews before I read this book... it could have sat on the shelf never read if I had and I would have been missing out on a wonderful book!  My personal opinion, this book was very well written, with an exciting plot and characters that I fell in love with.  I loved EVERYTHING about this book.  It will definatly be staying on my bookshelf (which I cannot say about almost all the books I read, they usually get taken to the used bookstore for credit).  And I look forward to reading more of Brenda Joyce's works!<br />Just remember that all of these reviews are nothing but opinions, and you have yet to make yours...	2001-11-06

This book unfortunatly was lacking in so many ways that I unfortunatly didn't enjoy it as I usually do when I sit down with a historical romance.<br />The first thing that bothered me as I read the book was how utterly corny Olympia and Jared were during their love making scenes.  It was so unbelievable and silly the way they talked to one another that I couldn't stop laughing and wonder what Quick was thinking when she wrote this???<br />The main characters themselves, both Olympia and Jared, I found to be very unrealistic and not the least bit interesting.  Jared bothered me the most out of the two.  First of all, the book and the back cover keep referring to him as a pirate which he most certainly isn't.  He's a boring, droll merchant.  Just because he lost and eye doesn't make him a pirate.  Which leads to the second thing that bothered me about him, the book sets up this dangerous pirate facade for Jared while at the same time describing him as an organized businessman.  It just made no sense what so ever.  Pick one, stick with it.<br />I also found the plot to be, while orginal, very dry, slow, and uneventful.  I think she could have done so much more with it instead of wasting her time with the corny dialogs.<br />However this is not to say that I entirely disliked the book, as always (with the exception of the corny loving making dialogs) Quick is an exceptional writer and the book obviously wasn't so bad that I stopped reading it.  I did make to the end...<br />I was just unfortunately not impressed with this novel.	2001-10-18

I've always been a big fan of historical romances, it's about 95% of what I read, for some reason those times capture me and I can imagine being there myself.  After reading this book I couldn't stop talking about it and nearly drove my husband crazy with my enthusiasm about the originality of this book.  If you like historical romances and you're looking for something that's different from your typical characters (who in most other romances almost always seem to be the same people in my opinion) this is what you need.  Jill Marie Landis did a great job.  This was the first book of hers that I've read and I'm looking forward to reading more of her works!  An excellent read!!	2001-10-16

The plot was great, very original and full of excitement, however I did find the romance a little hard to believe since it seemed to me that she spent so much time on the plot that there was none left for the romance... still I did find the book enjoyable and certainly would recommend it, just don't expect the romance to be thrilling but do expect an orginal plot.	2001-10-12

It covers all the basics one needs to know when caring for a ferret, or multiples.  Including ferret proofing your home, basic training technics with multiple suggestions for different behavioral problems since no two ferrets are a like and will respond differently and many many other topics.  I enjoyed this book and found it very informative since at the time I purchased it I felt I needed to learn more about my sweet little fuzzies and sure did!  A great book.	2001-07-26
