There is a lot of valuable information in this book and it's fairly inexpensive. <br />The first section of the book consists of some interesting biographies of some very good pre-war pitchers that baseball fans should probably know more about, as well as some lists of who threw the best types of each pitch and definitions of different pitches. Best pitch I've ever seen? Has to be Mariano Rivera's cutter.<br />The second section is a census of pitchers with 1000 IP or 400 games, showing what pitches they threw. This section can get a bit dry at times. It is interesting to see, in certain cases, how pitchers threw differently pitches at different times in their careers.<br />The final section is a collection miscellaneous Jamesian-style essays that we know and love. There are some trivialities, such as the essay on &quot;unique records&quot; (i.e. only one pitcher has ever gone 24-5) but I enjoyed this section. James also tries to shoot down pitcher abuse statistics, but I didn't find this very compelling since the data set seemed too small and had the potential of serious biases (as mentioned in the follow-up article).<br />My one major criticism about this book is that a lot of the information in the pitcher's census part (which comprises at least 2/3 of the book) is more useful from a historical records point of view rather than an interesting read. It's an incredible research job, no question, but reading that some pitcher in the 1920s threw &quot;1. Fastball 2. Nickel Curve&quot; does not do it for me. <br />I would definitely recommend this book overall though. I'm sure I'll be dipping in and out of it for most of the summer. It's something you can come back to again and again, not something that you are necessarily going to read cover to cover. The essays are very good as always and the book has a &quot;replacement-level&quot; price and &quot;all-star&quot; (though not &quot;hall-of-fame&quot;, to be sure) content :)	2004-06-15

As the title suggests it focusses on more of the theoretical side of perl. This is the first volume in a series of three books. The second one focusses on web and graphics, and the third one on games and diversions. <br />CS &amp; PP is divided into seven sections as follows: Beginner Concepts, Regular Expressions, Computer Science, Programming Techniques, Software Development, Networking and Databases. The articles are straight reprints from TPJ and are written by a number of leading perl people such as Larry Wall, Damian Conway, Mark Jason Dominus, etc. Jon Orwant, the publisher of TPJ is the editor for this book.<br />I haven't finished this book yet but I've greatly enjoyed the articles I've read. A vast array of topics are covered, such as B-Trees, random number generators, benchmarking, makemaker, DBI and even Win32::ODBC and Microsoft Office. There's something for every perl programmer in this book. Highly recommended.	2002-12-13

It's not as good as the previous Smash Pop Hits 1999-2000, in my opinion. <br />Most of the songs should be fairly easy to play for the intermediate player although some of the bass lines can be a bit tricky. &quot;Can't Fight the Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)&quot; are three of my favorites from this book. There are several hip-hop and dance tracks which don't really translate well to piano, which are a bit of a waste of space.	2001-11-13

The two main reasons for this are 1) the lack of major insights and 2) the huge quantity of typos (I stopped counting after around 20). The copy editor for this did an absolutely terrible job, I'm afraid to report (writing this guarantees a typo somewhere in my review :) ). Some of the players' names are spelled incorrectly, and some of the numbers in the charts are inconsistent. This is very distracting. <br /><br />The book is divided into 12 chapters, starting with a fairly trivial look at tabletop baseball games. The authors devote much attention to evaluating offensive performance, comparing various measures such as batting average, SLG, OBP, linear weights, total average, runs created and a few other more obscure ones. There is also some discussion of clutch hitting and a look at &quot;Did the best team win the World Series?&quot;<br /><br />One of the other problems I found was that the authors stop short of providing actual statistical formulas and get into hand-waving a few times. I see that they have all the academic credentials but it seems as though they took the &quot;book sales are inversely proportional to number of equations in the text&quot; relationship to heart. I felt the book suffered because of that. <br /><br />I'm not sure who I could recommend this book to. I have a feeling that some of the concepts might be too advanced for kids, and not deep enough for those who have a decent understanding of statistics. If you are into baseball stats but you don't know much about real statistics you will definitely find some new concepts in here, so I guess that is the audience.	2001-09-25

It's one of those books where it's often hard to find the information and you end up looking elsewhere. <br /><br />To start off with, the index is not the greatest. Try looking up &quot;ORDER BY&quot;. It's only mentioned in the index as one item in an EXPLAIN PLAN command. In general, I found the examples they use to be only bare bones examples. It would be nice to see some more complex SQL. <br /><br />On the plus side, the book seems fairly free of errors and a lot of information is packed into the pages. There's not a whole lot of writing but you shouldn't be expecting that given that it's an &quot;essential reference&quot;. <br /><br />This isn't a bad book per se. However, it's been on my desk for nearly a year and I just don't find myself using it much.	2001-08-22

It includes Madonna's single &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; which was written for the movie and not a part of the original Broadway show. <br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. The music is great and the arrangements are not too hard to play, for the most part. Personally I had trouble with &quot;And The Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)&quot; because it is in 7/4 time but in general any intermediate pianist should be able to enjoy this collection. &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, &quot;I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You&quot; and &quot;On This Night of a Thousand Stars&quot; are particularly good, as well as the popular &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot;.	2001-06-25

Some of the bass lines might be difficult to master for the beginner.<br /><br />The value that you get from this book is outstanding. There are well over 50 songs and if you listen to pop music you'll know almost all of them.	2001-06-19

The more recent ballads like NEM and Unforgiven are excellent on the piano, but Harvester, Seek and Thing just don't really translate well to the keyboard. <br /><br />I think you'll enjoy at least half of this collection if you like Metallica and you've played the piano for at least a couple of years. It's not beginner music, but most of it is fairly straightforward to play. I was a bit disappointed at the transcription of some of the solos -- they leave some of them out -- then again, they were meant for guitar and not piano.	2001-06-05

There's a chapter on each of the major .NET features including the Common Language Runtime, C#, VB.NET, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Winforms etc. It definitely removed a lot of the mystery of .NET for me. Previously all of the info I had read on .NET was vague generalities but this book really gets down to the actual details.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to people who are experienced with C++, VB and COM. The book was more technical than I expected and there is a good deal of code. One problem was the editing, there were several mistakes and the book had a bit of a rushed feel to it. Having 10 co-authors makes the style a little uneven and there are a few items that are mentioned by more than one author.<br /><br />This is a decent technical overview of .NET. If that's what you're looking for I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2001-03-13

I could pretty much give this book a rating anywhere between 1 and 5 stars and justify it. That being said, I have learned a lot of perl through reading the book &amp; doing the excellent exercises that are provided (with answers), therefore it deserves a decent rating despite its faults.<br /><br />The book is an overview of the language, not a reference. It's a tutorial that takes you through the major language features. Some of the chapters are regular expressions, filehandles, formats, hashes, functions, etc. The writing is generally clear and accessible and the examples are very well done. Most people should feel comfortable using perl after working through this book.<br /><br />The real failing of the book is that it is pitched as a Win32 book but it is full of UNIX-centric examples and idioms. The chapter on DBM is likely to go unused by almost every Windows programmer and there is not much coverage of OLE automation/COM/ActiveX, which is key to Windows. The book would also have benefitted from a look at Windows system administration tasks and how to automate these with perl.<br /><br />Another minor frustration is the &quot;Topics We Didn't Mention&quot; appendix. This book is only 220 pages + appendices, index, forewords and there could easily have been room for discussing those topics (like basic networking, security, the compiler). <br /><br />In short, it's a good book to learn perl with if you're stuck using NT at work like me. That being said, the book is rough around the edges and could be polished significantly in a future edition.	2001-01-26

The book is divided into 10 chapters: First Principles, 7 chapters on various categories of bloopers (GUI Component, Layout and Appearance, Textual, Interaction, Web, Responsiveness and Management), Software Reviews (reviews of Eudora Pro 4.0 and Kodak Picture Disk 1.2) and War Stories (accounts of the author's experiences as a consultant to two different software projects).<br /><br />The book's major strength is that it provides good, detailed descriptions of typical problems and realistic fixes for them. It is not a book of theory or magic bullets but a book for people who want to actually improve their interfaces in a straightforward and substantial way. The book also provides a set of 8 first principles which are the fundamentals of creating good interfaces. There are a good variety of Windows and Mac examples.<br /><br />The book has few weaknesses and it accomplishes what it set out to do. The most glaring flaw is the lack of captions beside each illustration of a blooper or an example of good design. <br /><br />I would recommend this book to any interface designer or programmer who writes small in-house applications and does the interface design as well as the coding. There are probably better references if you are looking for something specifically on web design, although the first principles the author discusses certainly hold.	2000-12-05

There are many good exercises given for the reader to explore further programming concepts. Some of the mini-projects that are discussed include pattern-matching, a library to deal with data in CSV format and program that uses a Markov chain algorithm to generate readable prose.<br /><br />One minor flaw in this book is that almost all of the examples are written in C, C++ or Java, whereas the title of the book suggests a more generic approach. <br /><br />I'd recommend this book without hesitation to someone who has been programming for 2 or 3 years and wants to really improve their productivity and add a level of professionalism to their coding and program design.	2000-12-05

The segments are quite heavily cross-referenced (which I didn't find very useful). <BR><br />The authors dole out a lot of solid advice, which is the book's strength. I found myself disagreeing with very little. There are memorable tips and some good stories. The writing style is also very accessible and conducive to diving in at any page. <BR><br />The book seems a bit lightweight. The exercises are a little simple and I don't think you'll find yourself going back to this book a lot. Also, the typeface is annoyingly large.<BR><br />I'd recommend this to someone who has done some programming and understands the syntax and fundamentals but hasn't gotten into programming larger pieces of software. I think that if you have programmed anything significant you won't find much new in here.	2000-12-05
US	50753971	RX4E8U5N3XSSR	0596000448	164294385	Designing Active Server Pages	Books	3	20	21	N	N	Disappointing	<br />This is a mediocre book that doesn't have a very good focus.  The first four chapters are fine as introductory chapters, discussing how to pick a server-side scripting language, how to handle exceptions and &quot;regular expressions, classes and dynamic evaluation and execution&quot; (i'm not sure how those got lumped together!) There are two main chapters, one on form reuse (that has some reasonably useful info) and one on a reusable database admin page, which may or may not be useful. The methodology is interesting but it seems to have limited usefulness. The final chapters outline COM &amp; how to use 3rd party COM objects. The information here is at a very high level and you would best be served by getting a book devoted to that topic.<br /><br />My biggest concern with the book is that the title is hopelessly misleading. There is almost nothing on &quot;designing&quot; active server pages. We are instead led through a couple of administration apps and a high-level intro to COM &amp; how to use 3rd party components. I expected information on how to structure your application, on performance issues, on scalability, on security, session &amp; application variables, maybe even something on database issues. Unfortunately most of the author's advice seems could be summarized with &quot;encapsulate your code: use classes, COM objects and include files&quot;. <br /><br />I found that a lot of the writing seemed wordy and repetitive, unlike most O'Reilly books. Also this book seems pitched at intermediate developers, say those that are familiar with the syntax but don't have much expertise in building multi-page ASP applications. I don't think experienced ASP developers would get much out of this book, since they probably have written their own code to accomplish some of the things discussed in this book.<br /><br />I wanted to give this book a good review, being a big fan of the author's web site,.... Unfortunately this book is not a keeper. If you want ASP booksget &quot;ASP in a Nutshell&quot; (O'Reilly) for the syntax, &quot;Developing ASP Components&quot; (O'Reilly) if you want to get into COM and Professional Active Server Pages 2/3 (Wrox) for an excellent look at real ASP programming in an enterprise.	2000-11-21

There is very little coverage of any other forms of investment, and what coverage there is, is biased strongly against anything other than stocks on the Dow or small-cap growth stocks fitting their criteria. Calling this book an &quot;investment guide&quot; is pretty misleading.<br /><br />The book is written in a know-it-all style that you will no doubt either love (apparently a lot of other reviewers) or hate (me). The pages are full of their cheesy and repetitive medieval references concerning &quot;fools&quot; and &quot;wise&quot; men. And if those don't grate on you the unending plugs for their online services will.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is basically as follows: investing in mutual funds is stupid because you are virtually guaranteed an average 25.5% return by picking 4 stocks on the Dow Jones using a formula. Now, this is obviously absurd. Yes, the system worked over the past, but it isn't working currently (check fool.com under portfolios to see how they're doing this year -- DOWN 1.84% as I write this) and there's no proof it will work in the future. Also, the hypocrisy is overwhelming as they continually dis those who claim to have systems and also those who use technical analysis to make stock picks.<br /><br />There are a couple of strong points to the book: the five chapters on small-cap growth stocks and how to evaluate them are very well done. They show you how to analyze a company's balance statement, and what sort of general financial indicators to look for when picking small-caps. Oh, and the Joey Roman penny-stock parody in appendix C is extremely funny.<br /><br />I can't honestly recommend this book at all. There are many other books that explain the same material, and with a more even approach. This whole book oddly reeks of a get-rich-quick mentality, while they shoot down everyone else's get-rich-quick schemes. The poor advice combined with ahokey writing style make this book a pretty painful read.	2000-10-21

There are no equations or lines of code, so if you're looking to implement anything this is the wrong book. However if you're looking to learn about IPSEC, public-key crypto, secret keys, SSL, virtual private networks and things like that this is the right book. <br /><br />The familiar cryptographic couple Alice and Bob are used in many examples to illustrate four general types of attacks made by &quot;Henry the Forger&quot;, &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, &quot;Play-it-again Sam&quot; and &quot;Bailey the Switcher&quot;. These are used throughout the book and this really simplifies understanding of how various types of cryptography can be attacked. Another one of the strengths of this book is lots of useful pointers to other books and Internet sites to provide supplementary information.<br /><br />I'm not going to give this book 5 stars because to me that's a perfect book. However I highly doubt you'll be disappointed with this book as an overview to cryptography and how it is used on the Internet.	2000-10-21

Everything from reading the  newspaper quotes, to analyzing companies to options and regular equities is covered. There are also detailed discussions of the author's personal picks and why they succeeded (or didn't, in a few cases). The book also makes it easy to understand the whole process that is going on behind the scenes, which is interesting.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are just trying to learn about the stock market. One accidental strength of this book is that it's very old (many of the examples are from the 50s or 60s) and so it manages to get across the concepts without resorting to all the tech-stock hype that you get with modern information. This book really emphasizes the fundamentals which is great for a beginner.	2000-10-17

Personally I loved it,  that's why I'm writing this and that's why I gave it 5 stars. It's a  fast-paced introduction to all different types of investing, from  fixed-income to stocks to futures. It's laced with retro-80s references  which you'll be familiar with if you're in the target 20-35 age group.  <br /><br />Despite the whirlwind pace the author has some very good substance to  offer. His philosophy of viewing every purchase you make as an investment  may come as a shock to some but it is the foundation of good personal  finances. He also presents the stock market in a very easy-to-understand  way, for the beginner.<br /><br />This is a fun, introductory book, that maybe  surprisingly bears re-reading several times (I certainly have). If you're  in the target age group and have just started to think about your money,  pick this book up. It makes a sometimes dry topic really come to life.	2000-09-17

It covers all of the new features in a very  readable and easy to use format. There are lots of code snippets and  example to help you understand quickly.<br /><br />The ADO objects are all  covered in detail, along with ADOX, ADOMD, Remote Data Services, Jet  replication, Data Shaping, even XML stuff. Plus there is an interesting  chapter on Performance issues which gives you a hand in deciding what sort  of techniques to use to speed things up. There are also around 15  appendices which have just the method names, constants and quick summaries  so you can look them up fast. There are even charts showing which drivers  support which OLE DB properties and which providers support which schemas.  <br /><br />Very highly recommended. First-rate reference book, excellent price.  If you already program with ADO you cannot go wrong with this.	2000-09-08

The  patterns are described using UML. There are several other chapters of  interest, including one on &quot;Bad Smells&quot; which lists many telltale  signs of poor programming and how to fix them.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just showing  my lack of sophistication, but Design Patterns went over my head. I only  &quot;got&quot; a few of the patterns. But this book is much more  accessible to an intermediate programmer who wants to improve his coding  style. If you've ever wondered how to write more maintainable code this is  your book. One good thing about this book is it's directly applicable to  almost every standard procedural or OO language, whereas Design Patterns  are pretty much for OO programming only. Even if you are writing VBScript  or Javascript for your web page you could use many of the techniques  illustrated here.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Buy this one.	2000-09-05

The authors discuss  almost every class of game (2-person, 3-person, zero-sum, non-zero-sum,  etc.) and even a very simplified version of poker. <br /><br />You basically have  to be a mathematician to get full value from this book. This book is  absolutely full of equations and complex proofs. For a beginner with little  math, I'd recommend Game Theory by Morton Davis, or for someone with some  university math I'd recommend Games and Decisions by Luce and Raiffa.  However, if your math is good, you might as well go straight to this book,  which started the whole field of game theory.	2000-08-23

The author covers all sorts of games  such as blackjack and bridge, and provides mathematical derivations of all  sorts of probabilities. There is also a most interesting discussion of the  pari-mutuel system used in wagering on horses. A good assortment of  challenging problems for the reader are also presented. <br /><br />The only  warning I would give is that the book is probably not suitable for someone  who has at least taken 1 university course in calculus and algebra. While  Epstein doesn't use any advanced math, there are certainly a lot of  formulas and a certain familiarity with math is essential.<br /><br />This being  said, the book is a classic in its field. If you're interested in the  mathematical study of gambling you will not be disappointed. This is one  book that you can read many times and always find something new and  interesting to try.	2000-08-22

Prof. Murray's thesis is that the Gestalt psychologists (primarily Koffka,  Kohler and Wertheimer) anticipated the cognitive revolution of the late  1950s. It's an interesting idea and there are definitely too many  similarities between their schools of thought.<br /><br />The book itself is  pretty much average. I found the writing style a bit awkward. There are a  lot of good explanations of various experiments. There is quite a lot of  history interspersed with the psychology, so it does make for an  interesting read, if you're up on these fields. I wouldn't recommend this  for the layman but if you're in cognitive psychology it would be worth the  read.	2000-08-21
US	50753971	R3390OJ3G8MKHM	1565924460	708964364	Developing ASP Components	Books	4	7	8	N	N	very good intro to COM	<br />This is a very good book which introduces the non-beginner to COM. The book is divided into 4 parts. The first part is introduction that includes  background, environment info, a very good explanation of threads, and some  stuff on MTS. The last three parts cover the implementation of components  with VB, Visual C++ and Java (Visual J++).<br /><br />This book has really good  practical examples such as the test to illustrate how a single-threaded  component works, in chapter 4. Also, the author has a very clear writing  style which makes the book easy to read. <br /><br />I would recommend this book  to any ASP programmer who wants to start writing COM objects.	2000-08-16

Asfor quality, there is a summary of every native VB function (plus thefilesystem, dictionary, data binding and data formatting objects) with useful examples and good non trivial tips, as well as all the VB constants. There are also 6 chapters (about a 1/5 of the book) that discuss the basics of VB, plus class modules, automation and error handling.<br /><br />If you are VB developer who feels comfortable working with the language but you forget the odd thing (and who doesn't), then you cannot go wrong with this book. The quality control on the book is exceptional &amp; you always find a new tip or gotcha.	2000-06-23

It's very concisely written and there are a ton of interesting projects and programs to do. I've done a few of them myself and learned a lot. This book is one  of those that I keep going back to and I always find some new idea or thing  to try out.<br /><br />If you're a programmer and have been thinking of getting  into genetic algorithms, you won't go wrong with this book. Very highly  recommended.	2000-06-15

It walks you through pretty much everything in an efficient manner. Despite the fact that it's long it's not repetitive and you don't get the feeling they're trying to pad it  (like some publishers). <br /><br />There's a good chapter on error handling,  which is a little confusing for the novice. There are also good intros to  objects and components. <br /><br />I don't have any real complaints with the  book other than, somehow, I don't find myself referring to it that  frequently. If I want quick reference of keywords or commands I end up  going to the Nutshell book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for someone  who knows nothing about VB but has programming experience. This will  definitely get you up to speed.	2000-06-09
US	50753971	R1TH4PPOTQPWV7	1861002904	451558360	Beginning Site Server 3.0	Books	3	8	9	N	N	&quot;Beginning&quot; indeed...	<br />This is a decent but not great book . . . By far the mostuseful chapter is the 168 page (!) installation chapter, which detailshow to get site server installed under a variety of configurations. <br /><br />The rest of the book is a fairly high-level introduction to some of site server's features, such as pipelines, indexing, personalization and membership and site analysis.  These chapters tell you what you need to know to get a barebones example of each of these up and running.<br /><br />There are 3 chapters that basically go over the wizard which generates an e-commerce site, explaining the underlying database and how to do some modifications. These are quite well done (but I'm a little dubious as to how many companies are going to run the wizard-generated site right out of the box).<br /><br />The book is a fairly good introduction but it will definitely leave you wanting to look for more detailed information. I guess it achieves its purpose but I doubt there are many developers who would be satisfied with this. I don't see this as a book that I'm going to frequently use as a reference. I would recommend reading overviews of site server on the web, to get a feel for what it can do, and then buying some more advanced books. This being said, the installation chapter could be worth the price of the book alone (if you have installed site server you know what i'm talking about).	2000-05-30

I got a toy XML page working in no time at all. <br /><br />This book should appeal to programmers who are comfortable with ASP &amp; web tech in general. Definitely not for beginners.<br /><br />The appendices are very useful.  The entire XML 1.0 specification is there as well as an XSL  reference.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers criticized the dependence on  IE5, but then, IE5 is the only browser that supports XML  client-side.<br /><br />If I had a couple of criticisms they would be the layout  and the editing. But these are small flaws that do not get in the way of a  very solid book.	2000-03-24

I use it nearly every day and it rarely fails me. <br />If I had one criticism it would be that the ADO and FileSystemObject objects could be covered in a little more detail.  I'd like to see return values of the functions, and listings of the numeric  values of the various constants (e.g adCmdTable = 2).<br />Also, both this  book &amp; Developing ASP Components promise &quot;Mastering ActiveX Data  Objects&quot; from O'Reilly. Where is it!	2000-03-10

I think I'll go and buy the Addison-Wesley one.<br />This book is vague and littered with  manager-speak. Not for developers at all (there is no code, for a start  off). If you have ANY understanding of objects and classes you will find  the first 4 chapters completely useless. <br />It did have a reasonably good  bibliography, but it's like they're saying, haha we tricked you into buying  our book, now go read the good ones...	2000-03-06

I don't think I learned a thing from it... If you have a really great mathematical mind and you think in terms of sets and relations then it might be your  thing. I now have a decent practical understanding of databases but every  time I go back to this text as a reference it still makes no sense at all.  &lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />It is pretty complete... but it is highly unlikely you  could actually learn anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;	1999-11-25
