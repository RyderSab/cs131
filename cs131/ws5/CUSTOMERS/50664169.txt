Bennett, Silver Sage	I felt so blessed to learn about \\"The Masters of Wisdom\\", John G. Bennett's last book.  Imagine the power of reading the last book of a man long on the wisdom journey who knew so many other wise ones.   <br /> <br />Imagine having the opportunity to read a complete history of wisdom through the ages from the beginning of time.  I feel like I got a master's degree in wisdom (no pun intended, but it sure did get in there). <br /> <br />The best excitement from the book came from tying up so many loose ends about the Essenes, Chaldeans, the Sarmon (I think Bennett's spelling is the third I've seen) Brotherhood, who they really were and how they came to be and why they were formed.  Dozens of books later, I understand more from Bennett than all the others.  Still, the others served to let me know about them. <br /> <br />I can't imagine any wisdom seeker, college, university, or parent who would fail to make this amazing book's wisdom available widely.	2005-05-25

Of course, I wanted to leaf through all 100 scrap books and maybe one day I will be able to.  For right now, I would recommend this book to anyone who: <br /> <br />1.  Loves Lucy <br />2.

So, he used to the fullest what was able to respond to him, his mind, and blessed the entire universe with his wisdom.   <br /> <br />Best of all, CLAIMING YOUR PLACE AT THE FIRE makes you feel warm and comfortable about walking your path instead of so afraid of what will happen to you. <br /> <br />	2005-01-24

Imagine creating for the world a home museum experience unequaled in all the world.

No one could have created Fenway Court except Isabella Gardner.  Few have created such a wonderful life for themselves and left such an amazing legacy.

And it seemed from the beginning, I would finish this book as quickly as I could ply away the time.   <br /> <br />\\"Debby's Requirements\\" became my favorite story for two reasons: <br /> <br />1. A belly laugh that just would not quit over an elaborte set-up and punch that still makes me laugh. <br /> <br />2. One of her \\"requirements\\" shined up my dull solid cherry furniture that I have all over my house. <br /> <br />\\"Up the Escalator\\" made me feel understood when my feet feel like iron balls walking up broken escalators. <br /> <br />\\"My Last First Date\\" made me wish explore a relationship with a guy who treats me a lot like Burroughs' Dennis. <br /> <br />The big payoff for me was Burroughs' ability to allow me to truly know what another person thought and felt in real life situations as honestly as he could remember and tell me, like I was the best interviewer in the world and I had adeptly pried every thought and feeling out of him, even the ones that made him uncomfortable revealing.  He gayness and my straightness stopped being important. <br /> <br />I discovered throughout that, God forgive, I actually got Burroughs' sense of humor. <br /> <br />I also got a strange buzz from feeling like I was one up because I got to know so much about him without revealing anything about myself.  You go Augusten and thanks for the memories! <br /> <br />	2004-11-22

Some main mistresses ruled both the kings and their kingdoms for years while some along with their children nearly starved.  One mistress was so hated for marrying her prince that the king ordered assassins to rip her to shreads in her own garden. <br /> <br />And, the author has an obsession with Madame Pompadour who appears throughout the book as if the icon for a king's mistress. <br /> <br />One mistress went to war with her king.  Most mistresses were constantly at war with those who would unseat them.   <br />Out in our Wild West one Bible studying Lola, King Ludwig's mistress who broke his heart, chased, caught and horsewhipped a man.   <br /> <br />Can you imagine what one former mistress lectured about in 1857 at 37 in America and Europe and was well paid for it and attracted crowds? <br /> <br />Find out about the tossed aside mistress whose jealous and insane husband announced he was a tulip, planted his feet into the ground, and ordered his servants to water him, which they did.  Learn the fates of the cast aside mistresses who went crawling back to their husbands. <br /> <br />All of this intrigue, gossip, backbiting, sabbotage, murder, poisoning, potions, betrayal, espionage among mostly stinking, dirty, flea-infested, lice-covered people who rarely bathed, except one mistress who insisted on a bath at least three times each week and put up with the stench of her king, makes the book a hard-to-put-down read. <br /> <br />The detailed life of a mistress:  no peace, no rest, always at your best and subject to loss of royalty's attention at the drop of a petticoat.  Yet, famous paintings of Agnes Sorel (Charles VII) grace some of the most famous museums in our time.   <br /> <br />I learned what country's mistresses were the most powerful and which were the least, in general.  What mistress who married after she was let go by the king told her sons that they have to take it on the chin if people call them sons of a whore because they are, but told them never to allow anyone to call them bastards because they were legitimate, unlike the king's children she birthed.  <br /> <br />And wait until you hear about their financial rewards during and after their tour of bed duty, including the one who absconded with her booty and had it confiscated. Fascinating is the best word for this book.	2004-08-31

Depends on your feelings about manipulation, who you want to manipulate and who you don't think it is right to manipulate. <br /> <br />And, while I understand how difficult it is to embrace brevity, the book is 200 pages tops spread out over 380 pages.

It is a tedius read in small, light type.  If I were smarter when I began reading the book and saw the lay of the land, I would have used the Technique Summary on Page 365 more intelligently.  For example, the First Step section includes trustworthiness,positive focus, cleanliness, grooming, accessorizing and fitness and being dedicated and committed.

I kept turning page after page excitedly looking for more. <br /> <br />I found that the \\"National Enquirer\\" was more than I thought it was after reading Calder's historical pictureless tome. <br /> <br />Yes, it was a huge disappointment that there was not one picture in this 314 page book except for Iain Calder on the jacket.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-13

Plainly, I stayed stuck and measured everyone against the feelings I had for him.  The book taught me that I could find lasting, wonderful love without having to duplicate the soulmate relationship connection of long ago.   <br /> <br />I found the book so freeing for me.  That it was okay to have what some would call old-fashioned attitudes about sex.  That I could be open without being so afraid of rejection.  That it takes persistence like the searcher who went on 77 blind dates before he found the right one for him.  Best of all, the book confirmed my conviction that there is someone for everyone.  The trick to finding someone is to actively look.  And that was something I was not doing with my whole heart, soul and spirit.  I will speak to people who attract me.  I will avoid feeling stupid if I find they are already taken.  Instead, I will feel wonderfully happy for the lady in their life they mentioned so quickly.  I hope one day to be that lady to a wonderful man. <br /> <br />If you are a single who wants to be a couple, you can discover much to help you in Collins and Grigsby book.	2004-08-05

I am looking back over 60 years of life and learning where I lived that was a &quot;house of belonging&quot; and where I lived that was not.  Having lived in 30+ places, the journey is most interesting.  <br />David encouraged me to look at the concept of belonging and showed me the importance of feeling a sense of belonging where I am in my life. I learned, like David, that a home can give you a sense of belonging even if you are the only person in it.  That was a glorious revelation for someone single for 25 years.<br />My journey through the book bubbled forth poems, memories, aha moments, self-understandings and explorations.  Wow!

Sometimes, a high maintenance, self-destructive, low self-esteem child is one of them.  Parents who have children like this often move into denial to survive, calling the behavior a phase, teen trauma, and/or peer influence.  <br />Greta Eichel's family has an abundance of secrets that get more deliciously intriguing by the page.  Yes, &quot;Surviving Ellen&quot; is a page turner that catches you.<br />Most importantly, this book is a book about love, mainly about the relationships of people who love someone who did not know how to love them back.  The Socratic question for the reader to answer in this book is &quot;do you know how to love the people you love in a way that feels loving to them?&quot;<br />And, it is also a love story about two people, Greta and Stu, who knew how to love each other from the beginning and are still at it and going strong.<br />Like its title, this book is also about the strength to survive, whatever it takes, whenever it is necessary, however long it takes.  <br />I believe this book could save many parents from having to survive their child's suicide.<br />Even those who have near-perfect children may benefit from it to help grandchildren or step-family members.	2003-11-17

Imagine, as a bonus, getting \\"the rest of the story\\" from the massive number of letters van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo.  This was an amazing labor to gift us who buy this book to learn what van Gogh thought about other painters who also became famous, how he painted, painting processes he engaged in, and sometimes what troubled him and how he spoke about his \\"episodes\\" to others in his circle.  I felt I had secret access to van Gogh as I read his thoughts about relationships he had with other masters and his feelings about other painters in his time.  <br />As a painter, I loved learning about van Gogh's painting technique, color choices, and thought processes.  I learned first hand what van Gogh was thinking when he painted individual paintings I have seen many times, the ideas, the color combinations, the places he loved.  <br />Even though I had read many books about van Gogh and many more that contained information about him, after reading this book, I felt I had an intimate knowledge of him, really knew him, even felt mentored by him.  <br />You don't have to be a lover of art or artist to gain tremendous insight from this book. Anyone curious about people, interested in exploring the mind of a genius, and especially those interested in personality traits and individual psychology would find this book a treasure trove.	2003-10-30

We artists know that each painting is a spirit that is very much alive.  <br />Unlike most book discussions of great art, Bohm-Duchen's is a page turner and almost a voyeuristic glimpse into the private lives of 8 artists, not so easily gleaned in the retrospectives and other tomes that speak of the art of these famous artists.I got an amazing pictural look at Jackson Pollock and gained a greater respect for his artistic composition and methodolody. I discovered the history of madness of the van Gogh family here and not in literally dozens of other books on van Gogh and his body of work.  Every other book merely said Theo, his benefactor and art gallery owner brother, died about six months after van Gogh and never mentioned madness as the cause, or that his youngest brother killed himself at 32 or that his favorite sister, Wil, also spent time committed to a mental asylum.<br />Bravo!

The instant emotion shocked me, forced me to pick up the book.  The tears still come every time I see the face of Jean Moulin.<br />Why?  Jean Moulin is one of the few heroes who took responsibility out of goodness rather than vainglory.  Jean Moulin cared so much for the freedom of his Beloved France that he suffered until death to achieve this grand goal and become the greatest hero of the French Resistance.  <br />As an artist, Jean Moulin speaks to my heart and soul.

Every person who has no faith could benefit from reading this book.  Anyone who is curious about Hollywood life will gain satisfaction from reading this book.  In fact, I can't imagine anyone, of any age beyond 12, who would not benefit from reading this book.  <br />Of course,I loved this book! I grew up watching Loretta Young and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen coming out of their doorways and communicating with their angels. How special for me to find out that they were friends.<br />However, something I never expected came out of this book and created for me a wonderful faith-confirming miracle.  Loretta Young struggled hard, like I struggle, to keep my Catholic faith. She missteps and comes down on herself, then recovers again, only to misstep again.  What a power example of living a life of faith &quot;Forever Young&quot; is. No book I have ever read epitomizes living an examined life as thoroughly and enjoyably as &quot;Forever Young.&quot;  She wasn't a priest or a nun or a saint or a Pope.  Loretta Young was a secular person, just like me, working hard every day to follow in the footsteps of the Divine example God left for us in Jesus.  Nothing preachy or teachy, just a good women with sinful human blood running through her veins, determined to avoid the sins that tempt and live a good life. Loretta had her man picking avacados and I had my coatless women to whom I did not give one of my three coats.  Neither of us ever could forget our foolish selfishness.<br />And, of course, I enjoyed reading about the stories of favorite stars.  Richardo Maltalban married one of her sisters...Clark Gable's fathering her child....  But the one that really hit home was the Spencer Tracy romance.  I had read &quot;Tracy &amp; Hepburn&quot; and believed that Katherine Hepburn was the love of his life.  Imagine my surprise that, rather, it was Loretta Young, who understood him and shared his struggles to keep trueto his Catholic faith. It goes to show you that you can never just believe all the media hype.  You can never assume you know without getting all the facts.  <br />The best part is the happy romantic ending where Loretta finally finds a relationship that works for her, brings her satisfying love and happiness.  <br />Another connection surprised me, hers and Nancy Reagan's.  The surprise was not that they knew each other, but rather the surprise as to how alike they were in that they were first great ladies of grace, charm and tremendous personal self-discipline, never letting personal tragedy lead to self-pity.  Both have had their share of troubles and disappointments with life and children making hurtful choices.  Still, they remained focused on what would be the loving reaction.<br />Sit yourself down with a soothing drink, have tissues ready, and spend some time with Loretta. You will know more about taking charge of your life for your investment.	2001-03-29

When he said not only did he lose 55 pounds, but his wife, who was not part of his project, lost 25 pounds, just from hearing his tape as they were getting ready in the morning, I knew I had found something worth trying. And, the script is in the book word for word!<br />I am on my 5th day.  And, I didn't stop at weight loss, I also taped his scripts for global motivation, and selling.  So, every morning, for six plus minutes, when I used to get ready in dead-air time, I am listening to my own voice giving myself success marching orders.<br />So, what's happened in five days.  I had a speaking engagement booking goal for January and I met it by January 18.  I have revamped my entire marketing plan on the internet, changed my email signature, wrote a new speaker biography, created a corporate slogan, revamped my unique selling proposition statement, 30-second commercial, and am struggling with the two-minute elevator speech. Why? Because I think trapping someone in a metal box trying to engage them in being interested in what I do is annoying.<br />Wondering about the weight loss?  Want the truth?  The psyche hates changes and sabotages efforts until you pin it to the mat and make it behave.  I am still at the mat stage.  It's like this.  I am one of those who has 9 pounds to lose.  The first skirmish began when I went into the supermarket the first day I listened to my morning tape.  I just happened to walk by the bakery and just happened to see my favorite fried apple fritters on sale, get ready, &quot;buy six, get six free.&quot;  I swear, they never had a sale that good that I can remember.  The good news is I have only two left and I am determined to buy no more, like never, ever buy those dirty pound-attracting dogs again!  So, I have 9 pounds to lose, up from 7, because those dastardly apple fritters cost me two pounds.  And, it won't let methrow them away.  The good news is that, for the first time in a long time, I went out to a business dinner and actually left food on my plate and left half of my chocolate cake.  <br />I will get this weight off.  The tapes will help.  After all, I have kept my weight managed for 47 years.  You would think that after all this time, my psyche would cooperate.  Think again!	2001-01-22

In a conversation with a retailer discussing the buying habits of the public, he told me, &quot;I follow Roy Williams.&quot;  The name sounded somewhat familiar.  The merchant then said, &quot;want to read his book; I have it in the back?&quot;  As soon as I saw the book, I remembered that I had already read &quot;The Wizard of Ads.&quot;<br />Roy H. Williams takes advertising and turns it upside down, right-side up, and inside out.  You see what works, what doesn't, and how to walk the narrow path that gives you the best return on your advertising investment dollars.<br />Most important, Bard Press and Williams make it a great read, good-looking book with substantial pages, big print, no extra verbiage, lots of white space, and new and exciting concepts:<br />1.  Huebner Fifth Rule of Mountaineering: Never look where you don't want to go. 2.  Six Tugs of War 3.  Calculating your APE 4.  Hamp Baker's advertising genius 5.  Nitroglycerin 6.  The Secret Path to Miraculous Ads 7.  Find out the real story of how we got our Statue of Liberty 8.  The Buying Public is Your Dog 9.  The Three Sacred Cows of Advertising<br />Williams' concepts are intelligent:  better to focus your advertising to reach 10% of your market 100% than throw money at 100% of your market to reach 10%.<br />Advertising is a complicated art and Williams boils the concepts down to make them user-friendly for you.

Many men who are at the heads of the &quot;Fortune 500&quot; fought in a war or fought their own wars from the time their parents let them outside to play. Bottom line, men fight, get hurt and get up again and again.  Women in white-collar America have never caught or ducked a punch, or given one either.<br />After a male has picked himself off the ground half-dead, dog-eat-dog corporate politics seem like a cake walk. Conversely, career-destroying political moves can devastate women who have no experiential concept of kill-or-be-killed fighting to the finish.  Men also know the thrill and the excitement of the fight.<br />Beyond the learn-to-play-nice he said she said communication books, &quot;Leadership Lessons&quot; shows men with the cuffs off, exposed bare, scared, proud, and, sometimes, laugh-out-loud funny, like the story about &quot;The Grey Ghost,&quot; Colonel John Singleton Mosby when he slapped the sleeping butt of the enemy general in his own bunk.<br />I found the book so intriguing I read it from cover to cover in one sitting.	2000-05-17

Those mentioned range from the  self-centered to the selfless, all defining a future in their own way.  <br />As an example, the authors tell the pivotal Rosa Parks-like incident  that transformed an ordinary Indian barrister into an avowed crusader to  end discrimination of every kind, a crusade that would transform India.   The barrister with the first-class ticket, who protested the demand that he  move to the car for the &quot;colored&quot; people, was Mohandas Karamchand  Gandhi. The &quot;Mahatma&quot; (great soul) as he came to be called,  fought and won an unselfish battle against unjust deprivation of human  dignity for people of India, eventually winning independence for India from  British rule in 1947.<br />Champy and Nohria lead here a call to action that  anyone can come forward and invent the future, someone needs to do it, and  anyone can be that someone.<br />Bravo!	2000-04-05

(Perhaps in a future book, Hogan will tell how to give female  clientele an estrogen rush!)<br />One of the most valuable portions of the  book is Hogan's &quot;Outcome-Based Thinking Model of Clear  Communication,&quot; that encourages you to bring six outcome-oriented  questions to every important communication.

In addition, the authors give you options of using all stevia, mixing with  other sweetners, or using only sugar in some recipies.  <br />As a healthy  eater, I have been using alternative natural sweetners for years (Dr.  Bonner's Barleymalt Sweetner, for example), yet never was there a cookbook.   Dr. Bonner's stopped making their sweetner, so I am on to stevia and the  recipies in this book are fabulous.  <br />Buy it for the tantalizing salad  dressings alone.  Not only are the recipes good, they are unique, like the  cucumber salad and the Green and White Jade Salad.<br />As a vegetarian who  does not eat eggs, I was so happy to see an egg-free, no-bake pumpkin pie  recipe!  Yum!<br />Sugar does so many awful things to our bodies and our  minds, it serves everyone to at least give the stevia product and this  marvelous cookbook a chance.  <br />PS  Even if you fail to fall in love with  stevia, buy this book for the recipes and substitute other sweetners, which  they suggest.	2000-03-25

I got the feeling that he's tiptoed over life thus far, never really wanting to get into it with abandon. And at the very end when he made the effort to reach out from his heart, the response was &quot;Michael who?&quot; <br />Ironically, Michael Crawford's book left me asking, &quot;who are you really, Michael Crawford?; what do you dream for yourself, Michael Crawford?; and, most importantly, what do you need to do to give you the confidence you say you lack to marry again, if marriage is what you seek?&quot;<br />So, with all these questions left at the end of the book, why the 5-Star Rating?  Because the first rule of the author is to make you care about the characters.  I came to care about Michael Crawford and the wonderful woman who spent half of her 99 years on earth loving him unconditionally.<br />And,it took great courage for this singer/actor to write his own book, in his own words, exactly as he remembered it.	2000-02-29

The Scenerio:  Two years ago, my kids were visiting from Germany and wanted to buy some English books to take back.  As a journalist/author, I have rooms of books, so I was hanging out in the front of the store near  the bin of &quot;Bargain Books,&quot; and Morrie called out to me from the  bin, &quot;read me.&quot;<br />So, standing at the side of the bin, I read the  book from cover to cover, learning about dying with dignity, the value of  listening to wise people, discovering the meaning of life through the eyes  of one old man and one young man, seeing love develop out of friendship,  and feeling friendship for both the old man and the young man.  Most of  all, it brought me back to my seven years of visits with my dying father  and planted a seed for an upcoming book of my own, &quot;Ain't Nothing  Going to Kill the Old Man.&quot;	2000-02-26

I found &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; about a year ago, heaped on a bargain table outside a Walden's Book Store in Pennsylvania while I was waiting for my daughter and son-by-marriage to finish their great hunt to  take books back to Germany where they make their home.  I had, of course,  heard Albom's story and eagerly began reading the book from the back to the  front.  Who knows why?  Quickly, I saw that I had to begin at the  beginning.  What a delightful, insightful journey!  Morrie and Mitch  touched my heart by their ability to find comfortable places in each  other's hearts and by their unabashed openness and willingness to share  with strangers.<br />Before we left Walden's, Morrie became my mentor, too.   He gave me the idea that the sooner you learn what's important, the sooner  you start doing what's important.  That motivated me to drop off the fringe  stuff and concentrate on the core projects.  <br />Morrie and Mitch left me  with the belief that one of the gifts each one of us has to give the planet  is our open hearts.<br />Every single person on the planet needs to read  Morrie for what Morrie can tell each one about himself or herself.	1999-12-16

A caution:  avoid getting hooked on the simplicity and the time-honored principles Covey writes about.  So what if you know the principles.  What good are they if you don't have them packaged in a way that you will use  them?  That's what I found valuable about Covey's &quot;Seven Habits.&quot;   Covey took a bunch of old rules and packaged them in a new way, into a  system that people could understand and really use.  <br />Covey found a way  to motivate me to organize my life in a way that enabled me to really do  it. He allowed me to let the medicine go down.  When I would start to slock  off, I would listen to the tapes to sharpen my saw.  Covey gives us the  battle plan and the marching orders:  Proact, Begin with the End in Mind,  Put First Things First, Think Win/Win, Seek First to Understand, Synergize,  Sharpen the Saw.  I have these pasted on my office wall after all these  years.	1999-12-16

The next best part is the content within an organized context:  picture, essay, turning point, and requiem.  We get the whole story on each picture.<br />This  book is definitely a keeper, belongs in every classroom in America, belongs  in the hands of every child in America, belongs on couches where people  gather to savor it and discuss its impact.<br />What a topic for  intergenerational discussion.  This is what was happening in the world and  this what was happening to me at that time.  At 56, I can remember my  mother holding the newspaper with these huge black letters in the headline  that read &quot;The War is Over.&quot;  I was two.  I asked her what it  said that made her cry.

Taken by the hand of Grizone I feel myself walking with Jesus, feeling His  feelings, listening to His thoughts.  <br />Grizone shows us that Jesus, too,  gets troubled and confused.  He writes, &quot;Father, when I began my  mission, I had to many dreams, so many things I wanted to accomplish for  You.  I thought I understood himan nature, and would sway the people to  come back to You.  But it is not working that way.  It is not that easy.   They listen only halfheartedly.  I am too spiritual for them.  They want a  worldly kingdom; all I have to offer is Your Kingdom of Truth and goodness  and the promise that they will one day live with you forever in Your  home.&quot; Most importantly, Grizone helps us by his example to forge a  genuine relationship with Jesus, the Christ, our heavenly Brother, the God  Who loved us so much,He willingly endured the shame and humiliation to  suffer and die for our sins so that we could gain salvation.<br />I feel  closer to Jesus when I read Grizone's books and Grizone reinforces my  feeling that I am never alone, that Jesus walks beside me most times and  carries me during my most troubled times.<br />I have read every one of  Grizone's books and I am sure that his first book about Cara, the falcon  who stopped eating flesh, somehow contributed to my decision to become a  lacto-vegetarian.<br />How desperately we on this earth need Jesus' loving  message.  For those who cannot or will not struggle through thousands of  years old Biblical text, there is Grizone writing of a modern Jesus who  embodies all the characteristics of Jesus, the Christ, Who always was and  always will be humanity's Blessed Savior!	1999-12-15
