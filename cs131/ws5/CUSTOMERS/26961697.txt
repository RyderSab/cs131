I cannot imagine an adoptee not feeling the pain, sadness and anger of having been relinquished by the mother. Yet, our own daughter, adopted at four days of age, insists that she has never had an identity crisis and has not suffered. Several of her classmates were adopted and are also not preoccupied by their past, nor have they initiated a search for their birthmother. We are now happily reunited with our birthmother (who found us) and our daughter still says she is not any happier now than she was before meeting her mother.I still want to agree with Joe Soll that repression may be at work here. I want her to read this book.<br />Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-16

This is an informative book, giving sound advice on many aspects of adoption to both the public and prospective adoptive parents, such as open vs. confidential adoption. The author doesn't push either practice and gives important references addressing each. She is informative and straightforward about the issue of infertility and has caught me, personally, in the rather stupid and offensive myth that adoptive parents, who relax after adopting, will get pregnant.  I admit to having felt this way before we adopted and then I became so absorbed in our adopted infant daughter that I forgot about getting pregnant--and got pregnant. Well, it would have happened anyhow! I am now a grandparent with children of our adopted daughter and agree with the author that 'what makes a 'real' grandparent is far less biology than it is psychology.' I like the author's sensible advice that concern should not stop with the birthmother's prenatal care but be extended to the prospective adoptive parents health and their ability to cope with the demands of a new baby or toddler entering their lives. I also like the author's caution about keeping certain information regarding the child's background confidential so it won't turn into family gossip.

The title of this charming book  already tells us that the author includes the birthmother in the family's lives.

The author also charmingly introduces Penny, the dog adopted from an animal shelter and young Elizabeth is happy for Penny to have a family too. It is fun to see the two little Chinese girls talk about their  \\"far mommy and a near mommy\\" and fantasize talking to their far mommy on the toy telephone. The author cleverly weaves in the adoptive family's love for the two unknown Chinese birthmothers and throughout the pages lets us feel Elizabeth's joy and sorrow when she thinks of her unknown Chinese mommy.

Pavao, an adoptee herself, was only told once of her adoption and after that \\"no one would talk, no one would explain.\\" She grew up with the poisonous idea that \\"people who have secrets about them think there's something wrong with them.\\"  When she met her birthmother, the secrecy continued. No wonder, today, as a \\"family-system thinker,\\" Pavao works to change a system that perpetuates secrecy and in so doing The Family of Adoption is meant for everyone in the world of adoption, but with focus on the best interest of the child. Pavao points out that birth and adoptive families are not the only ones responsible for the family of adoption. She deplores the fact that to this day material on adoption in medical school texts are lacking. The nation's psychiatrists, pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists and general practitioners are taught next to nothing about adoption. Law schools, too, neglect to give lawyers and judges a broader framework within which to view adoption and serve each client and case. Social workers too get inadequate training to work with complex families, as do professors in psychology programs. Pavao points out the \\"sad change of events\\" today which shows that adoptions in the U.S. are not based on a deliberation about the child's welfare but on business considerations. Her informative  book tries to stir both public and private adoptions in the direction of seeing what placement would be the best for the child, and not best for the family, agency or adoption professional.

The reunion of our daughter with her birthmother 29 years later was like Schaefer's with her son a very positive event that in our case enriched the families on all sides. Schaefer dispells the terrible myth that women who give up their babies are not really mothers and soon forget about the baby. Nothing could be further from the truth, as many books by and about birthmothers have shown us. I could never understand how anyone could have entertained such thoughts to begin with.

I want to live on the planet Dr. Rappaport resides on and so do the tens of thousands of women in the United States who surrender babies every year for adoption. The tears never stop, whatever adoption practice the children were placed under. Read Merry Bloch Jones, Birthmothers and you'll see \\"the amputation of the heart.\\" Rappaport describes open adoption as though it were a rose garden in which \\"...close relationships between the adoptive parents and birthparents become almost casual or routine, just as they would be in a biological family. The sense of normalcy is striking\\" (p. 120). Yes, of course, this may be the case with some open adoption arrangements, but Dr. Rappaport writes that \\"most open adoption families\\" consider the presence of the birthparent(s) \\"just a normal and routine part of their everyday lives.\\" We do not have longitudinal studies that support this view, and common sense tells us that it cannot be true of most open adoption arrangements. We learn in a see-saw of research papers that many birthmothers report that if they had to do it over again they would not have chosen adoption but raised the children themselves. Some would even have chosen abortion over adoption. Mothers relinquishing a child for adoption often tend toward more grief symptoms, especially if the adoption is an open one, than parents who had lost a child to death. Studies show that many mothers using open adoption often feel more socially isolated, express more difficulty with normal everyday life, feel more despair, and express more dependency than their counterparts using confidential adoptions.<BR>Dr. Rappaport's book was published in 1992, but meanwhile we do have more data available. We learn from the largest longitudinal study (720 individuals) conducted by Harold D. Grotevant and Ruth G. McRoy on the full range of adoptive openness, (Openness in Adoption, Exploring Family Connections. Sage 1998): \\"The clearest policy implication of our work is that no single type of adoption is best for everyone.\\" These authors warn that the long-term impact of openness for all parties in the adoptive kinship network is not known and longitudinal research is necessary to answer this question. Most importantly, the long-term impact of openness on the children is as yet unknown. In fully disclosed open adoption, the child is continually reminded that she has two mothers. This \\"insistence of differences\\" is a vulnerability in open-adoption families which professionals and laypersons are concerned about. David H. Kirk's Adoptive Kinship Theory predicts that openness in adoption imposes strains on all parties in the adoption triad as a result of role ambiguity. In their study Openness in Adoption, New Practices, New Issues, (Praeger, 1988) McRoy, Grotevant and White suggest that \\"The child may be more likely to feel that he is `matched' with his adoptive parents, if he or she is not constantly reminded of the contrast between birthparents and adoptive parents.\\" The authors suggest that Semi-open adoptions (no personal contact between birthmothers and adoptive parents but non-identifying letters through the agency) tend to minimize problems regarding role expectations of adoptive parents and birthparents.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-14

She thinks that this question reflects the paradoxical nature of adoption itself and while she answers the question with an \\"unqualified yes\\" she lives with the paradox that \\"they are mine, yet not mine.\\" The title of her book suggests that international adoption complicates the issue of entitlement because the child \\"race remains unchanged. A Korean-born girl named Bridget O'Leary is still Asian to the world-at-large, and that facet of her identity needs to be affirmed and nurtured.\\" Children's ethnic group, race and nation of origin all are involved in the competing claims of entitlement, not simply between birthparents and adoptive parents.

Pelzer's model of woman was his hideous mother, and yet he did not turn against women. The book is offered as a story of triumph and forgiveness, yet I, as a reader, have a hard time forgiving Dave's  mother. My first thought was: I hope she's in prison for life! I am a strong believer in personal responsibility, no matter what one's afflictions are. Alcoholism does not, in my belief, excuse a person's actions. This woman was fully responsible for putting her son through a living death. At every page of this sado-masochistic drama  I wanted to call the police and protect this child. Bless the teachers, the school and social worker who rescued the child Dave, and bless Dave's kind foster parents, Alice and Harold who adopted him into their hearts. These good fortunes taught the child that his mother was an aberration of nature and that not all human beings were like her. Today, Dave Pelzer has received so many national awards and has inspired hope and resilience in so many individuals, that we can only think of him as a true saint. There seems to be nothing inside of this man that sent him down the road called  the 'compulsion to repeat' onto others what had been done unto him.

Unlike some other writers who think that children as young as 2-1/2 can understand and conceptualize the ideas of birth and adoption, Keefer and Schooler  recognize that only by age eight do children have the ability to think in abstract terms and begin to understand the meaning of adoption. (In their book, Openness in Adoption, Exploring Family Connections, Harold D. Grotevant and Ruth G. McRoy found that only at the mean age of 10.5, age range 8.0-12.1, is the adoption relationship fully understood with its characterized permanency.)  Schooler's description of the adoptee's various developmental stages is worded such that it appears all adoptees grieve, go through stages of anger and during adolescence experience an identity crisis. The adopted youths 'identity may fluctuate with their current fantasy of the birth family.' I am puzzled by our daughter who insists that she has never suffered an identity crisis. She has grown up with many adopted children, some of whom suffered such a crisis, others did not. Some studies of identity crises in adoptees and nonadoptees have shown no significant differences between the groups, so that 'adoptive status itself cannot produce a negative identity.' One study showed that nonsearchers had more positive self-concepts than searchers and overall self-esteem, identity, family self, physical self, self-satisfaction. These nonsearchers had less concern than searchers about their own background.<BR> But research results are like see-saws: One result says green, the other says red.

The authors shrink from nothing, including suggesting looking on the black market and in high unemployment areas and sending out ten thousand cards with your phone number and the message that you will help someone who could help you find a baby. You get drilled on how to approach social workers and lawyers to the point of lying by omission. This book is seductive in that it is written in a sure-handed style and provides a great deal of useful information. <BR>I like the fact that the authors are open minded and do not insist on one adoption practice over another. That's good and confidence inspiring for the prospective adoptive parents. The authors say: 'We live in a diverse society, and adoption should reflect that diversity. Open adoption is appropriate for some people; more traditional agency adoption is appropriate for others. Some people's needs will be best met in independent adoptions, others' in private agency adoptions.' The authors are also cautious about the new extreme in today's adoption practices, openness, and write: 'The best single reason for being cautious about some kinds of open adoption is the lack of research on how it affects the child, the birth parents, and the adoptive parents in our own culture.' Here, Martin and Groves echo Grotevant's and McRoy's report in their longitudinal study, Openness in Adoption, Exploring Family Connections (Sage 1998): 'The clearest policy implication of our work is that no single type of adoption is best for everyone.' These authors warn that the long-term impact of openness for all parties in the adoptive kinship network is not known and longitudinal research is necessary to answer this question.<BR>Good luck to everyone who is looking for a baby.

Yes, 'it ought to be replaced by a system under which children in need of homes may be assigned to the care of foster or adoptive parents as quickly as reasonably possible.' We have several couples in our neighborhood who have adopted children of other races, and two black children are among them. This is real progress. <br />Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

The author gives constructive advice on how to win the trust and affection of a grieving, raging toddler. We adopted a four-day old girl in 1969 and were spoiled by the ease of raising our daughter compared to what it might have been like to adopt her as a toddler. I do know one family that adopted four older siblings and the stress of trying to earn these childrens' trust all but broke up the marriage. I greatly admire anyone who does the right thing and adopts an older child. After reading this book, I actually feel a little guilty to have taken the easy way out. One has these dreams of adopting the cute little boy or girl next door but doesn't realize that the toddler available for adoption may have special needs. <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

Those of us who have not experienced such a situation think it harsh for the author to challenge the notion that a stable home environment is always the best answer for abused or neglected children. Not having walked in the author's shoes, we may be quick to say that Ms. Loux's family wasn't the right family to cope with the two seemingly incorrigible girls. I am unwilling to make that judgment, but I do wonder whether Ms. Loux and her husband, who had full time careers, should have ventured into adopting older children who can be presumed to have suffered damage. The children must, in essence, have been raised by babysitters or other caretakers rather than by Ms. Loux. I am also wondering how much time Ms. Loux spent with her children's school teachers and whether there was adequate therapeutic intervention for the children and the family as a whole. All this would have required ongoing attention by Ms. Loux, and it is difficult to see whether a dual career family can meet the needs of abused children. Yet, I observed a neighbor who had adopted a seven-year old girl from a severely abusive home, and the adoptive parents did everything imaginable, including full-time care by the adoptive mother, to rescue this little girl. We tried to help too. Still, the girl went down an unstoppable path of self-destruction that included pregnancies, drug use, prostitution and ultimately lingering in prison with AIDS. This adoptive mother does not go so far as Ms. Loux in saying that 'her daughters have earned respect for their lifestyles and choices...She (Margey) keeps all the money she makes from prostitution to buy drugs.' To respect this life style must surely be the limits of hope for this adoptive couple. It is sad all the way around, but this book should not keep other prospective parents from adopting older children. Each situation is different.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

Also, the book offers a great bibliography. I could identify with several points brought up. Preplacement and postplacement stress (and joy!) is one issue I can still vividly remember. Also the fact that parenting adopted children is, in fact, different from parenting birth children. In our case, I found this to be especially true during the first year of our daughter's life when nature had not prepared me for the arrival of a child. Our daughter was four days old and loved around the clock. However, I found that the difference between her and our two birth children lasted only as long as the milk flowed. After that, I saw three unique individuals, and as the years went by, the issue of adoption was no more a household word than the issue of biological birth. We spoke lovingly of her birthmother and brought her up at special events, yet our daughter, very easy-going in temperament, never seemed to suffer an identity crisis or later, an interest in searching. When her birthmother appeared 29 years later, she began a cordial relationship with her but claims that the reunion has not made her whole while before she was fragmented. She had merely made a new friend. Perhaps our daughter was like the little eleven-year old boy quoted by Gulden and Bartels-Rabb: \\"You know all those things you've been saying about my birth parents? Well, I've come to the conclusion that those poor suckers lost a good thing.\\" It would be nice if all adopted kids felt as confident, but that's sadly not true.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

I am not an adoptee and so I can only observe from the outside what it might be like. We adopted our daughter at the age of 4 days in a secret practice in 1969. She grew up with many adopted children. I can tell you that our daughter, who was not interested in searching for her birthparents, does not fit the profile described by Lifton that 'adoptees have been in exile since their separation from their mother' and 'The difference between those who search and those who don't lies in how they formed their defensive structures as children: how much they denied, repressed, and split off.' Lifton was adopted at age 2-1/2 after suffering numerous losses, and her adoptive mother was not a very nurturing soul. In Twice Born Lifton said that after finding her birthmother she had no mother at all since both mothers had disappointed her. I see that her experience in life was very different from that of our own daughter and of that of many other adoptees. Even after our birthmother found us 29 years later and we now have a wonderful relationship, our daughter claims she has not changed since meeting her birthmother, that she doesn't now feel whole whereas before she felt fragmented. Several of her adoptee friends searched and several did not, some non-searchers are happy and well-adjusted adults who do not share Lifton's view simply because they did not suffer like she did. My objection to Lifton's book(s) is that she generalizes from her particular experience so that all adoptees have identity crises, all adoptees feel fragmented and cannot be whole until they are united with their birthparent(s). It would be better if she wrote: 'This is how I feel, and this is what I have heard other adoptees say.' It is important to stay away from generalizations.<br />Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

She was adopted at age 2-1/2, told of her adoption at age 7 and warned by her harsh and controlling adoptive mother never to tell anyone, especially her father, that she knew the secret. Lifton grew up with the poisonous idea that an adopted child is the product of an \\"evil deed that hangs over most adoptions.\\" The little girl was told that her natural parents were dead, which was a lie. It is easy to see how the adult author of  Twice Born came to the view that a person is \\"fragmented\\" as long as she lacks a link with biological kin, that an adoptee is  forced out of the natural flow of generational continuity, as others know it, and feels as if having been forced out of nature itself. Seen in these terms, adoptees become impotent creatures who have been denied free will. I am very moved by the story but want to say that this is the voice of one adoptee whose experience we should take careful note of but at the same time refrain from universalizing. Not all adoptees are raised by such harsh and emotionally vacant parents and also never had adopted friends with whom to discuss things. I am an adoptive mother of a daughter whom we adopted at age 4 days and who grew up into a contented, strong-willed and self-reliant young lady. Of course, we told her of her adoption, but she was not interested in searching for her natural parents. Unlike Lifton who as a toddler had experienced separation, loss, grief, mourning...going from mother to Infant's Home to Foster Home to Adoptive Home, our daughter and the other adoptees in our neighborhood were spared such miseries. Luckily, our birthmother looked for us and today we have a wonderful relationship with her and her family. Our daughter, however, does not feel she changed  since meeting her birthmother, or that she became \\"whole\\" as if she had been fragmented before. Several of her neighborhood adoptee friends are also not interested in searching and consider themselves well-adjusted adults and parents. I wonder whether Lifton would have become a happy adoptee if she had been raised by loving and honest adoptive parents. Unhappily, when she found her natural mother and the link with biological kin was made, she discovered that now she \\"had two mothers instead of one, but since both had disappointed me, I had none.\\" Yes, the bitter search for one's roots may take one to an empty place. It seems that the impulse of the adoptee to find the original mother, an urge traceable through the ages, exists as a force independent of the desired object, and continues even when the object has been found.

The author's style is delightfully unpretentious and weaves a wonderful tapestry of Taylor's adventurous life on the road, and every-day common events. I couldn't wait to find the meaning of the book's title and yelped when I did. The young adoptee, Turtle, looked at wisteria vines that buzzed with bees and said they were  'bean trees' because long green pods hung down from the branches. 'They looked as much like beans as anything you'd ever care to eat.' We don't usually adopt a child after it has been dropped in blankets on our car seat, but of all the adoption books I've read (including the one I wrote myself!) I haven't seen as charming a way of telling a young child about her adoption as in The Bean Trees. Never mind it's fiction. Taylor says:  'I let Turtle see the adoption certificate and she looked at it for a very long time, considering that there were no pictures on it. `That means you're my kid,' I explained, `and I'm your mother, and nobody can say it isn't so.'' The author didn't use the word 'adoption' or became preachy or defensive. No wonder little Turtle looked out the car window as though things out there were a lot more interesting than what she had just heard.  Then she entertained her mother with her vegetable-soup song that included, among the beans and potatoes, the people she loved. To top it off, Taylor's mother said: 'I don't think blood's the only way kids come by things honest.' <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

Some clinicians believe that the attachment formed to the mother or to some other consistently present person tends to endure and implies the formation of intra-organismic structures that won't go away even under the impact of adverse conditions. (See Ainsworth, Mary D. Salter. \\"Object Relations, Dependency, and Attachment: A Theoretical Review of the Infant-Mother Relationship.\\" Child Development 40 (1969): 969-1025). If this is true, then parents who face this dilemma can learn with Deborah Gray's help to understand and validate their children's rage and grief, and then try to help them with the therapeutic techniques that in Gray's experience promote attachment and increase the likelihood of success during the course of therapy. <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-11

I agree with the author that love is not enough.

Adoptive parents are well advised to be conscious of these issues and look for them in their children. There are many adoptees who suffer and would be greatly helped by their parents' sensitive awareness. I go down Eldridge's list and ask myself how we handled each point as we raised our daughter who was born in 1969 and came to us straight from the hospital. The biggest thing for me still today, as an adoptive mother, is our daughter's seeming happiness throughout her childhood and now, that she is a mother herself, she's over the moon.  I asked her whether she thought she was the \\"goody-goody\\" adoptee as Kathleen Silber and Phylis Speedlin refer to adoptees in Dear Birthmother who seem to grow up happy, don't ask questions and suffer no identity crises. Our daughter still maintains that she never had an identity crisis and that she never blamed her mother for having given her up. She also claims that she has not changed, as a person, since she met her birthmother---29 years later. But she knows adoptees who did suffer identity crises. If you are interested in two conflicting publications about adoptees who suffer and those who do not seem to be preoccupied with their adoption, look at: Sheridan, Tim (Foreword). \\"Relatedness Deprivation: A Review of The Search Institute Study of Adopted Adolescents and Non Adopted Siblings.\\" August 1996.

In the countryside, people often have no indoor plumbing at all...\\") and her in-depth explanation of the Chinese government's  rule that only one child is allowed per couple, preferably a son. The author spends a great deal of time explaining to the young adoptee why it is a costly catastrophe for a Chinese couple to have a girl when they really wanted a son. . . and so \\"your birthparents couldn't find a way to keep a daughter in their family and still have a son to take care of them later in life...\\" I cannot imagine that a girl child (no matter what age) reading these pages will feel good about her adoption, or, indeed, feel good about being a girl even though, toward the end of the book, the caring adoptive parents arrived. There is also too much explaining of other reasons why the baby girl was given up, such as medical problems, unmarried birthmother...all this added to the reality that girls are not wanted.  \\"They then carried you to a public place, like a park, or a busy street corner, or a police station- a place where they knew you would be found...\\" Frankly, I cannot imagine reading this book to an adoptee. These truths will be bitter enough when the adoptee is an adult and learns about Chinese history and culture, but are too brutal to be told at an early age. Just love the child, please, and reserve the unhappy details for much later. An enchanting book like that written by Rose Lewis, I love you like Crazy Cakes is all that is needed to soothe the little girl's soul and let her understand that she came from China. <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-08

The book ranges from the history of and regrettable reasons for secret adoptions, to the explosion of openness beginning in the 1970's  with its empowerment of birthmothers and the selling of babies by private agencies and on the Internet. The reader is offered the conflicting anecdotal records of openness, of the issue of opening up past secret adoption records, of reunions between parties of closed adoptions, and of keeping all future adoptions open. But Adoption Nation is prejudiced toward open adoption and leaves out the conclusion of the largest longitudinal study published in 1998 by Harold D.Grotevant and Ruth G. McRoy, Openness in Adoption, Exploring Family Connections (Sage 1998). These authors state: 'The clearest policy implication of our work is that no single type of adoption is best for everyone. Thus, we believe that a variety of adoption arrangements should be possible by practice and by law.' These authors warn that the long-term impact of openness for all parties in the adoptive kinship network is not known and longitudinal research is necessary to answer this question. The authors found in an earlier smaller study that semi-open adoption seemed to be the least harmful to the families involved in adoption. Literature tells us that we continue today, in both public and private adoptions, not to focus on what placement might be the best for the child, but on what is best for the families, agencies or adoption professionals. We think that if the adoptive and birth parents get on well, then open adoption is good for the child too for all ages, and for all developmental stages. But is it? One thing seems certain from Adoption Nation: Secrecy in adoption is a thing of the past. I am an adoptive mother of a secret adoption in 1969 and I was always opposed to secrecy. Fortunately, we met our birthmother 29 years later and love her and her family. Based on what she says today about openness, the golden mean of semi-open adoption would have been the best for her. Surprisingly, our daughter would once more have wished for a closed adoption. We need to find out what the children of open adoption are thinking as adults about their experience. <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-07

I can't say I can read Pinker but only study him. I felt punch-drunk after ingesting The Blank Slate. It was like taking an intellectual super roller coaster ride hanging upside down. Wonderful. John Locke, the fool who had come up with the idea of the blank slate, is finally dead. <BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-07

The book was recommended to me by a friend who is a scientist, and he changed his career and is now in the perfume-making business!! Well, I won't change my career, largely because I don't have one (I'm a writer!), but I'll read anything that'll flow from Suskind's pen or from his bottles of perfume!<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-07

Brodzinsky very cleverly introduces the fact to very young children that there was no father bird to help, that he had flown away long before the mother built her nest and laid her pale blue egg. The images of the mother bird and her struggles will instill love in the children for the little mother bird and at the same time love for the birthmother is sown and admiration for how hard she tried to protect her baby through all the storms, but failed to do so.  The adoptive parents of the little bird are also shown to be loving and understanding of the baby's occasional grief. A charming story.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06

Prospective adoptive parents of special needs children, both domestic and international, will greatly benefit from the important information and insights into critical emotional, educational and criminal issues dealt with in this wonderful book. I heartily recommend it to everyone.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06

I am an adoptive mother and our daughter was not like Samantha, nor were any of the other adopted children in our neighborhood. It was surprising to me how few questions the children asked as they grew up and how little interest they showed in finding their birthmothers. One reads about this phenomenon in literature. For that reason it's perhaps good to have books like this that may stimulate young adoptees into becoming more conscious of their adoption. Yet, I feel that this book, like many other books about adoption, focuses too intensely on the issue, neglecting the more general aspects of family life and caring for others.<br />Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06

Mr. And Mrs. Trepid, the harsh, cranky and tired managers of the misfit operation where Dallas and Florida lived, were \\"cold as winter-bound trees.\\" My children are grown now, and so I had the luxury of watching the antics of Dallas and Florida and love those \\"trouble twins\\" while wishing to put Mr. And Mrs. Trepid into the basement's dark Thinking Corner instead of the twins. The author shows us child-abuse by foster parents who were short-tempered, impatient, and quick to punish, but then we are taken to a nice place, Ruby Holler, where the \\"trouble twins\\" are loved by their new old foster parents. A heart-warming story.<BR>Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06

The travel logs of young Sophie and Cody give us glimpses into their past and the daily challenges of surviving at sea as The Wanderer sails across the sea (of life too?). What a young, courageous pair to love the big ocean and to face its dangers, violent waves and furious winds.  I'm afraid of the sea but after reading this book I want to go out too. This is a charming book about the courage of survival, grief and the young heroine's self-discovery. The experience on the sea has made her \\"all clean and new.\\"<BR> Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06

Many have grieved; others have felt relief; a number have entirely repressed their emotions. Regardless of what they think about relinquishment, many continue to struggle with the emotional effects of suppressing their maternal drive in the form of rage, frustration, sorrow, guilt, and self-doubt.  Many birthmothers emphasized that reunion was not a cure for the regrets, angers, or grief they faced after relinquishing. The author writes that 'even in mutually rewarding reunions, most birthmothers experienced profound sensations of loss.' Yes, I understand this feeling because I have personal experience with the birthmother of our daughter. Relinquishment occurred in 1969, when the baby was 4 days old and 28 years later our birthmother found us. Today, we love one another and our daughter has a cordial relationship with her birthmother, but our birthmother is facing the terrible reality that her grown daughter, now a mother herself, is not the needy little baby she had relinquished and a late mother-child relationship is impossible. 'Even reunions can't make it right.'<BR> I recommend this book to everyone, not just to members of the adoption triad. It is a book about humanity.<BR> Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?	2003-09-06
