In 1972, a sixteen-year-old student is living in Amsterdam with her professor father Paul when she discovers in his library a letter addressed to \\"My Dear and Unfortunate Successor\\".  Paul explains the letter through first person reminiscences of events that happened some decades prior.  The author of the letter, Paul's former mentor, Professor Rossi, had disappeared without a trace when Paul joined forces with Rossi's daughter Helen to locate the missing man. Paul's journey to find Rossi is intertwined with his search for Vlad Tepes, the Impaler, a fifteenth century ruler, (AKA Dracula)whom Paul believes may be Rossi's abductor.  The journey to locate Rossi is cleverly detailed as Helen and Paul travel from the U.S. to Istanbul and Bulgaria, as the author brings to life each locale, brimming with fascinating detail.   <br /> <br />    Alternating chapters return the reader to 1972, when the teenager leaves Amsterdam to search for her father, whom she believes is in grave danger, though he is merely away on a business trip.  Paul's quest to find Rossi and his daughter's decades later trip to find Paul offer interesting parallels, as both protagonists encounter mysterious vampire-like personas throughout their respective quests. <br /> <br />    Given that both Paul and his daughter's journeys are written in the first person, the reader may experience some confusion at the onset of the novel.  As the plotline of the read continues to flow, father and daughter's stories become more distinct, firmly engaging readers in the mystery behind the legendary Dracula.  Kostova's extensive historical research into both the myth and historical accuracy regarding Dracula add impressive detail to this original, smoothly plotted novel, which craftily combines elements of paranormal with real life experiences.      <br />	2005-07-03

Chad Kincaid, ranch employee and son of a neighboring rancher escorts the women on their final leg of the journey, convinced that Amanda is the desirable one, while Marian is the bookish shrew.<br />  But Chad's first impression of the two women is categorically wrong, as an unlikely twist finds Marian dressing dowdily so that men won't be caught in the beauteous Amanda's net if they dare to notice Marian first.  Add in Chad's confusion over the fact that he thought that he made love to Amanda (though it was really Marian), and he just might be honor bound to marry the self-centered Amanda, unless he can persuade Spencer Evans to beat him to the altar.<br />  Though the plot theme that a young Victorian era woman must marry to claim her inheritance is hardly a new one, Ms. Lindsay has put an interesting slant to this idea with the immense greed of Amanda versus the solitude seeking of Marian.

Embarking on a familiar plotline, this regency-era novel tells the story of beautiful Lady Adriana Sutton, the twenty-two -year-old contractually bound in marriage to Lord Colton Wyndham, the seventh Marquess of Randwulf.  <br />    Sixteen years after rejecting this contract of marriage, Colton, the war hero, has returned to claim his title upon the death of his father.  Unbeknownst to him, his sire reinstated the contract during Colton's lengthy absence.  While Adriana has every intention of fulfilling the ninety days of courtship required under the new contract, Colton isn't sure he wants to be manipulated once again when he learns of the latest agreement.  Admittedly, this novel is off to a slow start, with the lack of romantic tension between Colton and Adriana.  And the standard villain of this novel in the persona of Roger Elston, is originally portrayed as more of a nuisance than any real threat.<br />    No one excels more at flowery prose than Ms. Woodiwiss, and it is her style of writing that holds the reader's interest at the somewhat sluggish start of this novel.  When the romantic sparks begin to fly between Colton and Adriana, secondary plotlines keep the reader hooked with implications of an unknown pregnancy and suspicious murders.  And the loose ends of the novel are neatly tied together making this if not a superb read, a very good one.	2003-03-25

Born in 1723, in Ireland, Cormac O'Connor is the son of an Irish father and Jewish mother.  After both parents have died at the hand of the Earl of Warren, Cormac is determined to avenge their deaths. Aboard ship journeying to New York City to find Warren, he meets Kongo, an African sold into slavery.  And Cormac's kindness to the young African grants him with the slave's friendship.  <br />    Amidst the slave and Irish rebellion in New York in the 1740's, Kongo grants Cormac the gift of immortality in a cave, per the condition that he always remain on the island of Manhattan.  Leaving Manhattan would assure him immediate death and  ban him from entrance into the Otherworld.  Only when he meets and makes love in the cave to a dark-skinned woman with spirals on her skin can Cormac journey to the Otherworld.  <br />    Hamill has deftly portrayed the hopelessness of both the African slaves and the Irish indentured servants of the mid-eighteenth century, even as he reminds readers of the rarely-mentioned slaves who fought in the Revolutionary War without reaping the benefits of abolition.  While New York's past comes alive, no one could accuse Hamill of being a romantic, as his vivid descriptions of a nineteenth century New York with no running water and epidemics of cholera leave little room for the poetry of love.  This sense of realism gives an earthy feel to this novel whose only downfall seems to be that the reader is never really given much insight into Cormac's personality.  But overall, this read is a fascinating combination of sci-fi and history culminating on that tragic day of September 11, 2001.	2003-01-26

Ready to start anew, she has journeyed with friend Sandra from Chicago, as they plan to open a bed and breakfast leaving behind memories of painful divorces.  But the first familiar face Carly sees is Matt Converse, now the town sheriff, and then, the childhood friend who slept with her after prom and ignored her afterwards. It is said that there is a fine line between love and hate, which would clearly explain Carly's simmering anger, even after a twelve-year period.  <br />    When the two women take up residence in the old mansion, they decide to install new locks and a security system, convinced that a burglar was present the day they arrived.  The suspense builds, as both Carly and Sandra still seem fearful of the dark old home, and the possibility of an intruder seems both imminent and certain.  <br />    But the real crux of this read is the attraction between commitment-phobic Matt and Carly, delivering some really steamy love scenes.  Still, the likelihood of a lasting relationship between the two seems to strain credulity.  Though they practically grew up together, the evolution of their personalities over the past twelve years seems to be forgotten as bedroom scenes begin before they even get to know each other again.  <br />    That withstanding, the suspense packs a powerful punch amidst the sultry Georgia summer nights.  Hints of dead bodies, crimes of long ago, and a murderer following Carly catapult this read into a sizzling page-turner.	2003-01-16

The year is 1997, and his former boss, Colonel Karl Hellmann, asks Brenner, who completed two tours in Vietnam, to investigate a thirty-year-old crime that occurred there. <br />Allegedly, in February of 1968, a U.S. Army captain shot a U.S. Army lieutenant and killed him. The only witness was a soldier for the North Vietnamese army, named Tran Van Vinh. In a letter to his brother, Tran Quan Lee, Tran Van Vinh describes the occasion. An American soldier discovered the letter on the body of Tran Quan Lee and recently unearthed it in an old trunk and sent it along to Vietnam Veteran's of America. Paul's mission is to locate Mr. Tran Van Vinh and discover if he remembers the murderous incident. <br />Reluctantly agreeing to this mission, Paul flies to Saigon where he meets up with American Susan Weber who claims to be making contact with him to aid a friend. Susan's savvy knowledge of Vietnam helps Paul as he journeys across the countryside, ostensibly as a vet and tourist reliving old memories. As an airport confrontation with Colonel Mang leaves a cloud of suspicion over Paul, Susan's relationship with Paul aids his attempt to lessen Mang's suspicion. Paul's reawakening journey across Vietnam is not a history lesson, but a craftily worded journey that leaves the reader grasping for more in anticipation of the next clash with police and finally, the discovery of Tran Van Vinh. <br />Seasoned veteran Brenner is fully aware that there is more to this mission than meets the eye, but what, he has yet to discover. And Susan proves to be an enigma, as her abilities to squirm out of the most difficult of situations, are inconsistent with her status as an ivy-league American businesswoman. As Paul and Susan approach Tran Van Vinh's village near the Tet holiday, they must decide whether love and trust are codependent. <br/>With seven hundred plus pages of text, many a reader might be concerned that the description of places and battles in Vietnam would cause the read to drag. Not so, as De Mille is a skilled enough author to carefully integrate the present and past in a combination that encourages the reader to seek the compelling conclusion.	2002-02-02

When Douglas hires handsome Robert Marston to help oversee the company and keep a close watch on Jillian, other family members become rather resentful.

When Jillian begins to have strange dreams of fire, Robert becomes more convinced that he must stay by her side. And as they discover an old history book and meet with a psychic, Robert and Jillian learn that they now may have a chance to right the wrong of a past life. <br />Highlighted as a pre-Christmas tale, this is a light read with just enough mystery and miracles to keep the reader in a holiday mood.

As she continues her quest to capture the heart of Ellery, the blonde-blue-eyed younger son, Celeste has numerous encounters with Garrick, the staid older brother.

After her elderly employer passed away in Cincinnati, Claire ventured to San Francisco to find her brother, Donald, her only living relative. A twist of fate brings Claire to the Landauer Hotel where she seeks to find employment. But the part owner of the hotel, banker Garrett Monroe, meets Claire and finds her the perfect solution to his dilemma. <br />With his grandmother's failing heart, Garrett feels a duty to succumb to her pressure to get married. If Claire will agree to pose as his fiancé, he will hire a private investigator to locate her missing brother. Having no desire to marry, Garrett is surprised at the feelings that Claire seems to awaken in him. While she is staying with his grandmother at his home on Nob Hill, Garrett finds it difficult to stay away from her and decides that he would like to make her his mistress when their charade is concluded. But Claire will be no man's mistress, even as she fights not to be swayed by Garrett's powers of seduction. <br />While the attraction and subsequent love scenes between Garrett and Claire are both passionate and steamy, the characters lack the depth that would catapult this read above the ordinary. Garrett is portrayed as the typical male hero, tall, dark, rich, and handsome and chock full of arrogance. And Claire is the naïve, yet feisty virgin. Though many superior novels contain characters of this ilk, the personalities in outstanding romances are so complex and many-layered thereby turning the read from run of the mill to sublime. Overall, though, Ms. Waddell's latest is a pleasing read with a touch of mystery and suspense as the novel draws to its conclusion.	2001-12-02

Outsider MacAllister Booke had just rented Mia Devlin's yellow cottage for the duration of his stay on Three Sisters Island, off the coast of Massachusetts. Bad enough that Ripley wanted to rent the cottage to escape her home and newlywed brother, Zack, and his likeable wife, Nell. But Mac is visiting to conduct research on witchcraft and its history on the island. As legend would have it, three witches who separated it from the mainland created Three Sisters Island. Nell, Ripley, and Mia are descendants of the original three, only Ripley shows great disdain for the power she was born with. <br />In a crafty mix of the paranormal complete with visions and dreams of the past, Ripley comes face to face with her ancestor and senses a dark force that could destroy all that she holds dear. As the romance between the bookish Mac and Ripley builds, she is forced to let down some of her tough gal defenses and learns to trust him and their love.

Both girls are startled when Lord Gabriel Kenyon appears on their doorstep after accompanying their father on his expedition to Africa four years prior. Kate is especially embarrassed, recalling her previous declaration of undying love for Gabriel and promised seduction if he would convince her father to abandon his expedition. But Gabriel hasn't forgotten Kate and finds her more attractive than he did four years ago. <br />As he informs the girls that he is now their guardian, he warns them away from Sir Charles Damson. Gabe believes that Sir Charles is responsible for Henry's death and subsequent theft of a valuable artifact that Henry discovered. Romantic tension sizzles between Gabriel and Kate as Meg and Kate accompany Gabriel to his grandmother's estate and begin their search for the missing artifact. <br />Though the love scenes are sufficiently steamy, the romance seems a little contrived as Gabriel hardly seems the type of man to carry a torch for a sixteen-year-old girl for four years and then give up his wandering for her. And, while Yasmin's reappearance in England could tie up some loose ends and supply some angst to Gabe and Kate's relationship, the reader is left in the dark concerning the exotic Yasmin's seduction of Gabriel and subsequent association with Sir Charles. Fans of this author will recognize Gabriel as the younger brother of Michael, the hero in ROMANCING THE ROGUE. Avid readers of Ms. Dawson Smith shouldn't be too disappointed with her latest read, but it probably won't generate a lot of new fans.	2001-11-25

On a whim, Rosamund accompanies her friend, Callie, to Newgate to visit Richard Maitland, a former chief of the Special Branch sentenced to hang for committing a brutal murder. Believing in his innocence, Callie decides to provide Maitland with moral support on the eve of his hanging. As events go awry, Rosamund is caught in the crossfire and becomes Maitland's hostage as he engineers his escape. <br />Thrown together in a wild chase across the English countryside, Richard and Rosamund are drawn to each other despite their difficult circumstances. Ever the loner, Richard discovers respect and trust for the woman who nurses him back to health as she begins to believe in his innocence.

However, she becomes a little disturbed when a local reporter, Reed Howell, dredges up Pocal's Curse, a curse on the exhibited jade dagger discovered at an ancient burial site. Howell also suggests that the curse could follow Anna, as her father was killed in an earthquake sixteen years ago near the burial site where he was working. <br />With the murder of museum security guard Eddy Malacek and the theft of the jade dagger, suspicion falls on Anna. Clarence Tebbins, Tampa P.D., and Gil Garcia, St. Pete P.D., begin working the investigation. As clues consistently point to Anna, she becomes the prime suspect. Even when Gil discovers someone running away from Anna's home, he and Tebbins believe that she may be working with an accomplice. Their continued suspicion of Anna sometimes borders on the absurd, especially when she suffers a knife wound after being attacked. <br />The continuing mystery surrounding the disappearance of the dagger, heavily guarded by a top-notch security system, adds another element to this read. And the appearance of Nancy, Anna's identical twin, is especially appealing when the two agree to switch identities in an effort to unbalance the murderer and thief. The reader is left with the ultimate question-can the killer be found before he decides to end the curse in the only way he knows how, by extracting the beating heart of the descendants of the one who initiated the curse, a.k.a. Nancy and Anna Lundgren? <br />Ancient artifacts, a mysterious museum theft, and spooky curses definitely add to the allure of this novel. Never knowing where the killer will turn up next, the reader is kept glued to the spine tingling pages. While the mystery is more than adequate, the romance between Gil and Anna is rather short-changed considering that this novel is billed as a romance. Readers wanting the scales tipped in favor of mystery over romance will not be disappointed.	2001-10-21

Having recently broken it off with his fiancé, he decides to ditch his law career and purchase Manet Hall, an old plantation home near New Orleans. He first visited there when he and his college buddy, Remy, entered the dilapidated mansion years ago. Employing his woodworking skills, Declan starts renovation of the mansion. <br />Not long after he moves in, strange things begin to happen. Doors slam, clocks chime, and a baby cries. With the help of Miss Odette, a neighbor in the bayou, and research in history books, Declan is able to discover that the house has a dark history. Near the turn of the century, Abigail, a young Cajun servant, married Lucian Manet, heir to the estate. Their life together is cut short, when, shortly after the birth of their child, Abigail is discovered missing, and matriarch Josephine implements the rumor that Abigail ran off with a man who later killed her. Brokenhearted, Lucian \\"accidentally\\" drowns, and his twin, Julian, also dies young. <br />When Declan meets Lena, descendant of Abby's daughter Marie Rose, and granddaughter of Odette, he is completely mesmerized. She is the owner of a New Orleans bar and everything he ever wanted in a woman-she's smart, tough, and beautiful. Although the attraction is mutual, Lena guards her heart, as she senses that her feelings for Declan could lead to heartache. <br />Even as the reader is treated to glimpses of the 1899 Manet Hall, Declan begins dreaming of it. Cleverly interspersed with present day events is Declan's ability to feel and sense Abby's distress as he dreams of long-forgotten times. Lena, too, has eerie dreams and encounters of the past, and in an unusual twist, she senses Lucian's thoughts of old. As Declan and Lena face their desire for one another, will fate intervene a second time, and separate the lovers forever? <br />Ms. Roberts' latest is a sure-fire winner. The mysteries of the bayou abound as the ghosts tell the tales of forgotten times. Hauntings seem to increase as the renovations progress, and emotions between Declan and Lena hit an all-time high. Some readers may have trouble with the idea of reincarnation, especially with Abby living in Declan, and Lucian in Lena. However, the wonderful flow of the narrative, rich with fascinating characters, definitely outweighs any aversion to a twist on the paranormal.	2001-10-17

Fortuitously, she is almost run down by a passing carriage whose lone occupant decides to help her. Elizabeth Wakefield needs a companion and asks Rebecca to aid her in her journey to the colonies with her newborn son, James. Weak from childbirth, Elizabeth does not survive the voyage, and Rebecca is forced to raise James on her own. <br />Employing the skills she obtained at Mrs. Stockdale's Academy for Girls, Rebecca is able to make ends meet for herself and Jamey. She also skillfully fends off any amorous advances by inventing a fictitious Mr. Ford, her now deceased husband. Though Rebecca is a woman to be greatly admired for her ingenuity and fortitude, she is at times a little too sweet, with no apparent faults. <br />Nevertheless, Rebecca does well for herself and Jamey until ten years later when an agent of his father's tracks her to Philadelphia and asks that the boy return to England to live with his father, Samuel Wakefield, Earl of Stanmore. Rebecca travels to England to make sure that James is well settled and meets the coolly aloof Stanmore. <br />The development of the relationship between Rebecca and Stanmore makes this novel a step above many historicals. While Rebecca doesn't initially agree with the manner in which Stanmore relates to his son, she can't help being attracted to him. And while he is at first attracted to her beauty, he slowly begins to see beneath the surface and wants her for more than her physical attractiveness alone. <br />Villainous characters such as Louisa Nisdale, the jealous former lover, and Squire Wentworth, Stanmore's evil neighbor who dabbled in the slave trade, add a sinister element capable of tearing the lovers apart. And the historical depiction of the slave trade provides a unique addition to this novel primarily because the subject is not usually addressed as an eighteenth century English problem. <br />For a sure winner with characters you won't want to leave behind, THE PROMISE can't be beat.	2001-09-05

Throughout this read, we are given excerpts of ENVY, as each chapter is finished and given to Maris Matherly-Reed, editor and daughter of Daniel Matherly, of Matherly Publishing Company. <br />Though Maris discovered the manuscript among a pile of soon-to-be discarded unsolicited manuscripts, she is completely enthralled. She is initially unable to locate the author as he or she only included the initials \\"P.M.E.\\" and the address as St. Anne Island, Georgia. As part of the mystery within a mystery, Maris spends a great deal of time locating this elusive author and trying to delve beneath his gruff exterior. Parker Evans appeals to Maris, though his crassness shines through. The many layers of his personality as well as obvious secrets between him and handyman Mike add another element of mystery. <br />Add to the mix of mysteries, Noah Reed, Maris' husband of almost two years who is yearning to rule Matherly Publishing. His placating attitude towards Maris leads to her unhappiness, and she is not sure that he can be trusted. Even from a reader's perspective, Noah is cannily written as a character that may have a side hidden to the world. <br />As the story line of the manuscript unfolds, it cleverly meshes with the main plot of the novel. Maris makes some great discoveries on St. Anne Island, about herself, Parker, and her relationship with Noah. <br />This unusual work of fiction within fiction makes for a deliciously crafted read. With all the twists and turns of a mountainous road, ENVY will keep the reader hooked until the road levels out on the other side.	2001-08-31

As the lone survivor of serial killer Andrew Capra, Dr. Catherine Cordell escapes the horror she lived in Savannah to go to Boston and starts to put her life back together again. Though she rarely goes anywhere besides the hospital and lives in a very secure apartment, she is able to function very adequately in her position as a surgeon at Pilgrim Medical Center. But her sense of relative security is short-lived as a new serial killer emerges in Boston, and the killings are uncannily similar to those, which occurred in Savannah two years ago. Okay-Andrew Capra is dead, shot by Dr. Cordell, his almost-victim. Thus begins the quest for the new culprit. The endless possibilities add to the allure of this novel: Dr. Cordell, perhaps, a copycat killer, someone avenging Capra's death? Enter Boston's finest, \\"St. Thomas Moore\\", the detective who still brandishes a wedding band two years after the death of his wife, Jane Rizzoli, lone female detective out to prove her worth, Darren Crowe, resident male chauvinist. Moore and Rizzoli are a fine addition to this cast of characters-Moore struggles with his attraction to Catherine while Rizzoli struggles to succeed in a male -dominated profession while trying to understand her jealousy of Catherine. THE SURGEON plays like a finely tuned piano, each chord blending in harmony leading to the final resolution. The skillful use of medical terminology as well as the knowledge of anatomy, while somewhat gruesome, adds a chilling sense of reality to the murders. And, as the clues unfold, leading to the identity of the killer, the reader experiences a sense of dread as to who the next victim will be. Lights will stay on all night for this novel that is impossible to put down, and once finished, you won't want to sleep in the dark.	2001-08-28

When Portia's companion dies in childbirth, John Henry plays the gallant and steps in to marry Pip and provide for the child.<BR>It is almost inconceivable that John Henry would have pined away for Pip all these years after her last callous treatment of him. Selfish to the core, she believes that John H. married her because of her noble birth (he was only a lowly farmer's son). Pip goes so far as to suggest John H. wants to &quot;humiliate&quot; her by asking her to live in a gatekeeper's house at Manleigh Park where he is the steward.<BR>Portia is such an unlikable heroine that it is difficult to believe that she acts the way she does merely to resist a man controlling her life. Even harder to believe is that she has a sudden and total transformation on Christmas Day making her happy with her life and in love with her husband.<BR>Predictably, that love doesn't seem to last long as soon as Pip sees that John H. hasn't been totally truthful with her. In keeping with her true nature, she refuses to see him and calls him &quot;the most horrible deceitful man on the face of the earth.&quot; While the initial plot shows promise, it seems quite a stretch to think that a self-made man such as John Henry would continue to harbor love for Pip considering her horrible treatment of him years before as well as her abominable behavior towards him after they married. Though the spiritual element adds a nice touch, Pip's lack of humility would seem to preclude her relying on a higher power.	2001-08-26

Celia Sands, his beautiful English mistress and star of the play, vanished without a trace the night before the opening performance. <br />Now, some eighty years later, Alessandro 'Alex' D'Ascanio, grandson of Galeazzo, has contacted Celia Sands, a struggling young English actress, asking that she perform the lead in Il Prezzo, a never performed play. The Forlani Trust is restoring Il Piacere, Galeazzo's magnificent villa on Lake Garda, and the play will be performed at an outdoor theater there. <br />Celia isn't certain that she should take this role, since it appears that she is desired merely because she possesses the same name as the original Celia. But her mentor, pseudo-guardian and director Rupert does his best to quietly persuade Celia to take this part. And Celia ventures off to Italy and the disquiet of Il Piacere. The maid thinks that Celia's room has ghosts of its own even as Celia seems drawn to Alex whose comings and goings lend an air of mystery to the place. Add to the mix Daniela Forlani, whose possessiveness of Alex alludes to Francesca, Galeazzo's wife, who was jealous of his relationship with Celia. <br />Written in the first person, SEASON OF STORMS is a top-notch suspenseful novel that evolves into a truly riveting read. The mystery is not in the form of cliffhangers but a more slow-paced discovery of clues that will fall into place like the pieces of a puzzle. Rich with evocatively descriptive language, SEASON OF STORMS will transport you to another place, where murder and ghosts are a distinct probability.	2001-08-23

Secondly, the priest officiating is none other than Joe Russo, Mary's brother, \\"Father What a Hunk\\". Joe was the love of Annie's life when he broke up with her fifteen years ago to enter the priesthood. <br />Joe has never totally gotten over Annie. When Annie miscarried fifteen years ago after Joe had promised to marry her, he felt that he was being punished by God and left her to become a priest. Now he has decided to leave the priesthood-his heart is not fully committed to it. <br />But Joe isn't ready to give Annie up now, even though she wants nothing to do with him. When he gets a job working as a youth counselor in the building next to Goldman's Department Store, where Annie works, the two can't help but run into one another. Sparks fly, and ex-priest Joe and unconventional Annie become an item. Obstacles get in the way as Sophia, Joe's mother, dislikes Annie and wants her son to marry a more conventional Italian girl. And Annie is only half-Italian, with ever-changing hair colors and flashy clothes. Will their love endure these tests, and can Annie ever learn to trust Joe again? <br />For a delightful read, with a healthy dose of humor interspersed with enigmatic characters, this is a sure winner.

Neither is Hart, as together, they embark on a quest to discover the real reason that Gillian was murdered. In doing so, they place themselves and whoever they touch in grave danger. <br />Believable characters, an intricate story line, and climactic suspense make this a read to be savored.

Much to her dismay, she has to go to San Antonio, and her partner in the investigation is Brannon. <br />Marc is unable to forget that the last time they met, there was a courtroom between them, and Josie was insinuating that Marcs best friend and lieutenant governor, Bib Webb, had a motive for murder. Not to mention the fact that on their last date, Marc walked out on Josie in a huff over issues surrounding their intimacy. <br />As their investigation brings them into greater danger and closer to the murderer, walls of the past come crumbling down. But will this be enough to give them a chance for the future? <br />Though the story line has a nice flow, and the dialogue between the main characters is more than adequate, the plot seems to fall a little flat.

Most disappointing, though,is Brannons constant return to the subject of sex and Josette's fear of intimacy in almost every discussion that he has with her.

In 1813, Edinburgh, Scotland, Colin Murray, Earl of Cawdor and heir to the Duke of Argyll, discovered an emerald just like the one worn by the deceased Duchess of Argyll. Mr. Murphy, a Highland farmer, pawned the ring after he took it from Sarah, the orphaned girl he found wandering the moors seventeen years before. <br />When the Duke locates Sarah, he deems her his daughter and asks that she return with him to Inveraray, his ducal estate. Reluctantly, Sarah agrees to return, though she has no memory of the Duke as her father. And Sarah doesn't want to leave behind the animals that she has learned to communicate with using her pan flute. <br />At the Duke's request, Colin returns to Inveraray, to aid in the transformation of Sarah. With the help of Phineas Graham, the Duke's man of business, Sarah becomes a real lady. The attraction between Colin and Sarah is very real, but the Duke has forbidden a match between them. Poor Sarah begins to lose a part of herself, stops communicating with the animals, and almost forgets her quest to find the white unicorn. <br />Ms. Fobes has successfully achieved the task of integrating elements of fantasy into a historical novel. Without being overly fanciful, Sarah's quest of the white unicorn is used in almost an allegorical manner allowing it to mesh perfectly with the main story line. The reformation of the rake, Colin, is more believable than some as it takes place in a gradual and somewhat self-awakening manner. For a story to warm your heart and stay with you for a long time, TO TAME A WILD HEART can't be beat.	2001-08-10

Though Clarissa despised Lord Deveril, her inheritance has given her some independence, which enables her to go to Brighton upon her departure from Miss Mallory's School in Cheltenham. <br />It is not pure chance, which causes Clarissa to go to Brighton but a memorable encounter with a Major George \\"Hawk\\" Hawkinville at a parade in Cheltenham. At Hawk's suggestion, Clarissa was prompted to choose Brighton as a temporary place of residence with hopes of encountering the dashing officer again. <br />And encounter Hawk, Clarissa does, as she enjoys flirting with him and even visiting his family home. Though Clarissa believes Hawk to be a fortune hunter, she is certain he cares for her, but is a little disconcerted when he probes her about the mysterious death of Lord Deveril. Even though Clarissa is falling in love with Hawk, can she trust Hawk with the events surrounding Deveril's death? And will Hawk reveal to Clarissa the true nature of his interest in her even as his passion for her gets in the way of his original purpose? <br />THE DEVIL'S HEIRESS, the third installment in Ms. Beverley's series of the George's is an even juicier read than the previous work, THE DRAGON'S BRIDE. The development of Clarissa's character is a joy to behold, as she emerges from a dreary schoolgirl to a clever and engaging woman. The repartee between Hawk and Clarissa is incredibly clever with enough undertones to keep the reader's constant attention. And the inclusion of the rogues, former heroes in Ms. Beverley's prior works, adds much to the intricacies of this plot. A truly delightful read, THE DEVIL'S HEIRESS will make the reader's keeper list.	2001-08-07

Even though they are attracted to one another, both Viola and Ferdie try to keep their distance mainly because they both want the estate that neither is willing to give up. Will love prevail when seemingly unsurmountable obstacles get in the way? <br />Though this novel begins as a classic Balogh regency, there are quite a few twists and turns along the way. Neither hero nor heroine are what they first appear adding a fresh new spin to the regency. The love scenes are incredibly tender and unique to this hero and heroine.

Henry Atkinson was an acquaintance of Mary's Uncle William back in St. Louis. When William Clark described his niece to Henry, he wished to meet her. Mary, considered a spinster at the ripe old age of twenty-two, considered the General rather old for her tastes at first, since he was in his forties, but she gradually warmed to the idea of marrying him, and later in the month of January, she married him and traveled west to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. <br />Though raised in much wealth, Mary seemed to adapt quite adequately to her new home, though at first she unintentionally insulted the General by asking if the home belonged to the servants she brought with her from Kentucky. She also participated in the planting, an activity that she had never performed before in her life. At the center of the Atkinsons' lives were the ongoing campaigns to find the Indian Black Hawk with whom the General held a twenty-some-year feud. The General did his best to settle matters peacefully between the Indians and whites but was met with much resistance from the militia as well as the powers that be in Washington. <br />While Mary finally declared her love for the General, he had a wall around his heart which she rarely seemed to penetrate. Further complicating their relationship was the appearance of a beautiful young Indian translator by the name of Bright Sun. The General's relationship to Bright Sun was a constant thorn in Mary's side. <br />Steeped in actual historical events inspired by real people, this novel makes the west in the early 1800's come alive. Sparing no punches, Ms. Gilchrist tells it as it really was, rampant dysentary among Army troops as well as tragic deaths from cholera. This is a refreshing return to realism sometimes spared in many historical novels failing to give the reader a true picture of the times. <br />Though the relationship between Mary and Henry wouldn't be deemed a traditional romance, their marriage, though expounded upon with fiction, seems very true to the reader as they endure the trials and tragedies of everyday life. This is a richly descriptive read with an enduring story that shouldn't be missed.	2001-06-24

His quest for a nanny leads him to the home of Beatrice Cavendish, a long Meg of a spinster trying desperately to run the estate she inherited from her father. Bea agrees to let Mac stay at her home until his ship is ready to sail, though she is under the misapprehension that he is a widower and father to the children. In exchange, Mac agrees to teach Bea about the running of the estate. Lady Taubee, Bea's eccentric aunt, visits Bea's home and manages to get Mac to admit his true identity which is soon revealed to Bea. Mutual attraction leads Bea and Mac to marry, though she wants no man to control her future and convinces herself and him that she would be better off remaining to run her estate while he sails his ship and the children back to Virginia. <br />Richly entertaining and frequently laced with humor, this novel sets a pace that will hold the reader's interest. Bea and Mac are the perfect example of the phrase 'opposites attract'. She epitomizes the straight-laced English spinster, while he is the gruff American. Though the children are instrumental in bringing this unlikely pair together, their admiration for one another, both physical and intellectual, gives their relationship sticking power. <br />The supporting players make this book worthwhile, too. They create a sub-plot of their own, especially James, the over-dressed distant cousin of a footman. One can't help but wonder how his relationship to Bea really fits into the storyline. This is definitely a novel worth exploring.	2001-06-16

Walker is equally attracted to Daisy but is reluctant to act on that attraction for fear that a complicated situation will become even more complex.

Though she has had few clients in her first year of practice, she not only aced the bar exam but graduated at the top of her class.  Fellow attorney Grayson Hawthorne decides that Alice would be the perfect person to defend his brother Lucas who has been accused of murdering a prostitute.  <br />    At first Alice declines to represent Lucas, partially because she feels that the case would be difficult to win especially against her father, a veteran prosecutor.  Furthermore, Alice is disturbed by her attraction to Lucas, a known black sheep of his respectable family who has earned his reputation as the owner of a gentlemen's gambling club.<br />    After agreeing to represent Lucas, Alice is a little more than disturbed by his reluctance to disclose to her just why he couldn't have been involved in the murder.  As the attraction between Alice and Lucas grows, she begins to believe in his innocence as more clues surface proving the possibility that someone else is likely the killer. While the trial progresses, emotions hit an all-time high as Alice faces off in court with Clark, the prosecutor and her would-be suitor, as well as her father who has taught her much of what she knows. <br />    What a page-turner!!!  Linda Frances Lee had me glued to the pages as soon as I began reading.  The dark intensity of the hero coupled with the strength and innocence of the heroine are an irresistable combination. Because  the innocence of the hero is never entirely clear from the onset of the novel, the introduction of probable suspects and the manner in which they are connected to one another keeps the reader gripping the edge of the chair until the real killer is finally revealed.  This is a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy of DOVE'S WAY and SWAN'S GRACE.	2001-05-29
