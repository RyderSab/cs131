Born as the second daughter to a \\"so-so family\\" who lived in a \\"so-so town\\", Lily tells of preparation for a life of obedience, first to her father, then to her husband, and finally to her sons.  But when Lily is seven years old, she has the good fortune to make a \\"laotang match\\", something like a sister sworn for life, with another seven-year old girl named Snow Flower.  The two girls share the rituals of having their feet bound, betrothal, marriage, and the births of their children.  Through the years, the girls maintain a relationship that is closer than their relationship to their husbands.<br /><br />In this beautifully narrated story, Lily reflects on the choices she made in her life, and one great wrong that she inflicted on her \\"old same\\" Snow Flower.  Lily's observations on her life and the expectations of the Chinese society of her time for women are poignant and beautifully written.  I was sorry to finish this beautiful book, and look forward to reading more works written by Ms. See.	2005-09-20

This is an indispensable guide for knitting socks that fit great!  I had been wanting to learn to knit socks for a while now, but was unable to make the class offered by my local yarn shop, so I picked up this wonderful guide instead!  I am thrilled with the results.  In addition to the basic sock-knitting instructions, the author offers great tips to make better-fitting socks,  such as using a larger size needle on the ribbing portion of the sock.<br /><br />Gibson-Roberts gives a method to knit a sock to fit any foot, based on just two foot measurements.  I felt that the illustrations in the book were really helpful to learning the special heel and toe shaping techniques.  Also, she explains how to knit the socks from either top-to-toe ( which is the method I used for my first pair) or from toe-to-top.  Rather than purchasing a bunch of sock patterns, I would recommend picking up this book and letting your creativity run wild!	2005-09-12

Ned has a pleasant, although simple life, living as a caretaker for a rich man and working part-time as a lifeguard on the beach.  However, when his boyhood friends offer to cut Ned in on \\"the perfect score\\", Ned can't resist.  The plan is to steal several art masterpieces from a Palm Beach mansion, then sell them and disappear.  When the appointed time for the theft arrives, though, Ned's friends enter the mansion and discover that the masterpieces have already been removed.  The plot takes off quickly at this point, with the FBI and Dennis Stratton, the owner of the art, both hunting down Ned Kelly to find out what happened to the art.<br /><br />The plot takes some enjoyable twists, and Patterson and Gross introduce some interesting characters.  I especially enjoyed Ned's friend Champ, the former New Zealand jet racer.  Authors Patterson and Gross introduce quite a bit of information about the painter Van Gogh, and I really enjoyed this sub-plot.<br /><br />Patterson's trademark style of the very short chapters appears in this book, and I felt that this style worked better in this book than in some of his other books.  \\"The Lifeguard\\" was a quick, entertaining story which I would definitely recommend.	2005-09-12

In this first case, Pepper is retained by Jane Smyers, a University of Colorado Professor of Mathematics, to investigate the deaths of three other math professors around the country.  All three victims were specialists in the field of fractal geometry, a new and quite interesting research area. The three deaths have already been investigated by the FBI to determine if they might be related, but the FBI determined that the deaths were unrelated to each other.<br /><br />Pepper Keane, a former adjutant in the Marine Corps and also a former attorney, jumps right into the investigation.  Pepper lives in the hippie enclave of Nederland, and auther Cohen does a great job of painting a picture of the town.  Pepper himself occasionally suffers from depression and is hiding some secrets from his past, making him a real and livable character.  Along with his lifelong friend and fellow investigator Scott McCutcheon, Pepper follows the trail of the \\"fractal murders\\" and finds himself travelling to Washington state, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Massachusetts to look for clues.  The mystery was great and had me guessing until the last few pages.  This book introduces a lot of information about fractals and their applications, particularly to economics.  In addition to the mystery, there's a lot of interesting technical information in here!<br /><br />The plotting and character development are excellent, especially for a debut novel.  I'm anticipating spending lots mroe time with Pepper Keane and his investigations.	2005-09-05

Gloria's best friend Elaine Cody is getting married in two weeks, and Gloria and Matt are in Berkeley to help with the celebration and have a little vacation.  Just as soon as Gloria and Matt arrive in California, though, trouble strikes when they learn that Tanisha Hall, a young paramedic gunned down at the door to an Oakland hospital is the partner of Elaine's future daughter-in-law.  The plot thickens when they learn that the patient being transported to the hospital (who later dies of his wounds) is an Indian scientist working on highly classifed research pertaining to powerful new explosives using newly discovered nitrogen molecules.  Gloria and Matt begin to suspect that Elaine's fiance Phil Chambers might be involved in the two murders.  When Phil suddenly disappears, no one is sure if he's just gotten cold feet about his wedding or if he is running from the law.<br /><br />There's a lot of interesting and well-tied together plot lines in this book.  In addition to the mystery of the two murders and the missing Dr. Phil Chambers, there are some missing drugs and medical supplies, stolen from the ambulance company, which are found in the murdered paramedic's home.  As in all the stories in this series, author Minichino sprinkles in a healthy dose of scientific knowledge.  The information she gives on newly found nitrogen compounds and their use in new powerful explosives is really fascinating.  The characters in this series are well-developed and very believable.<br /><br />Being a former resident of the California Bay area myself, I thoroughly enjoyed the Berkeley setting.  Whether or not readers are familiar with the previous books in this series, I highly recommend \\"The Nitogen Murder\\" as a very entertaining mystery.	2005-08-27

I discovered the Sudoku Puzzle in my local paper a few months ago, and quickly became hooked on this puzzle.  (The Sudoku puzzle, in its typical form, consists of a large grid of 81 squares, subdivided into nine boxes of nine squares each.  The solver must arrange the numbers 1 through 9 so that there are no repeated numbers within each small box, in addition to no repetitions in  a horizontal or vertical row of the large puzzle grid.  Several numbers are printed in the puzzle as a starting point.)  Solving these puzzles is an exercise in pure logic; no wide vocabulary is needed like when solving a crossword puzzle.  So when I saw this book containing over one hundred Sudoku puzzles, I just had to have it!<br /><br />The best part of the book is the strategy guide at the front, which takes the Sudoko solver from the extreme basics all the way through tips for solving the most diabolical Sudoku puzzles.  I'm enjoying working my way through the book, towards solving the most difficult puzzles in the book.<br /><br />Try these puzzles, and I guarantee you'll be hooked too!	2005-08-17

In this debut mystery, Annabelle is stunned to find the body of the mother-of-the bride at her daughter's wedding reception.  The police quickly determine that the curmudgeonly Mrs. Pierce was poisoned, and Annabelle's friend and caterer, Richard, becomes the prime suspect.  The bossy Mrs. Pierce was universally despised in Washington society, though, so Annabelle and Richard, along with Annabelle's assistant Kate and nosy neighbor Leatrice go to work to find the real murderer and clear Richard's name.<br /><br />The characters in this story were wonderful and funny.  In addition to Annabelle, Richard, Kate, and Leatrice, I really enjoyed the secondary character of Fern the hairdresser.  Annabelle and crew pay a visit at Fern's shop to get the lowdown on the latest gossip.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the background of the wedding planning industry, and I found the excesses of the society weddings amazing and amusing.<br /><br />The solution to the mystery was a bit hurried at the end.  I look forward to the second story in this series, and I hope that all the great characters will be back.	2005-08-13

Her lover and private investigator Paul von Waggoner are out of her life, and as \\"Case of Lies\\" opens, Nina seems to be embracing her life and work in Lake Tahoe.<br /><br />Nina's masseusse asks her to take on a wrongful death case involving her Aunt Sarah, who was an innocent bystander shot in a robbery at a local motel, the Ace High.  It's been almost two years since the robbery and murder, and the statue of limitations is almost up on this civil case.  The shooter was never apprehended, and Nina grabs onto this mission to find the person who shot Sarah Hanna.  A large part of the plotlines revolve around finding the three young robbery victims at the Ace High, in hopes that they can help identify the shooter.  Of course, the robbery is much more complicated than it seems at first, and after finding the witnesses, Nina has her hands full getting them to talk to her.<br /><br />The robbery victims turn out to be grad students at MIT, and one of them is poised on solving one of the great mysteries remaining in the world of mathematics--the factoring of very large numbers.  It turns out that this technology is critical to today's Internet security, and the work of the young math genius turn out to be very valuable indeed.<br /><br />There is a lot of the story devoted to the higher math research.  I found this story line quite interesting.  I felt that this book was quite a bit stronger than the last several in the Nina Reilly series.  I enjoy seeing Nina and her son Bob develop further in each story.  Since Nina has severed many of her old ties to the Monterey area, this book stands alone on its own quite well.  \\"Case of Lies\\" is an intelligent, exciting legal thriller.	2005-07-30

On the eve of a joyful sendoff for the oldest son Luke to attend teacher's college, the Morrison parents are killed in a car accident.  To avoid being split up to live with various relatives who live in widely-scattered towns across Ontario, the two oldest children (Matt and Luke) decide to work to keep the family home in Crow Lake intact for their two sisters Kate and Bo.  The book is narrated from the perspective of the older daughter Kate, who is now a 28-year old adult and a college professor.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.  The writing style was beautiful.  Author Lawson paints a beautiful picture of the rural Ontario prairie.  Especially poignant were the many hours that Kate spent at the freshwater ponds near her home with her brother Matt, observing all the insects in the ponds.<br /><br />The plot was excellent, with the children having to face many trials, as well as just growing up themselves without parents.<br /><br />This is a book that I will read again and again.  It was a wonderfully written story.	2005-07-19

One afternoon, while searching for clues of illegal drug manufacturing,, \\"Ant\\" hears shouts at the Badwater river, goes to investigate, and ends up diving into the river in an attempt to rescue a 10-year old boy who has fallen into the river.  Although Ant manages to pull the boy out of the water, the young drowning victim is declared dead on arrival at the hospital.  Anton questions the people on the scene who witnessed the boy's fall into the river and finds out that the young boy and two of his cousins were harassing  tourists rafting in the river by throwing rocks at them from the cliff above, and Jonah Strasburg, a New York musician, became involved in a shoving match with the boys and accidentally pushed the victim off the cliff.<br /><br />However, with the political climate in town and the local townspeople's hunger for revenge for the boy's drowning, Jonah quickly finds himself being charged with first degree murder.  And Antonio Burns finds himself assigned as the lead investigator for the prosecution.  Antonio is a good cop at heart, though, and feels that a first degree murder charge is way too trumped up for an accidental death.  The drama of small town politics quickly unfolds in this excellent story.  Author McKinzie does a great job of making the small town characters seem true to life.<br /><br />Besides his burning desire to see real justice served, Antonio Burns also has a burning passion for rock climbing.  In particular, Burns is determined to conquer what he believes to be the most difficult \\"fat crack\\" in the world in a canyon near Badwater.  I enjoyed the technical details of the climb as well.<br /><br />This was the first Antonio Burns novel that I've read, although it is the fifth one written by McKinzie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I plan to go back and read the others.  If you're looking for a great police procedural set in the West, I highly recommend this book!he fifth one written by McKinzie.

But after the race, hundreds of runners become violently ill, and a lone terrorist steps forward and claims responsibility for handing out deadly ricin-laced water at the aid station.  The unknown terrorist claims to be a member of the 30 April terrorist group, which the CIA thought was present only in Europe and had been eliminated just weeks before.  The story moves along with rapid-fire speed, as the CIA tries to find the terrorist.<br /><br />Carolyn Carmichael is the CIA protagonist of the story.  Carrie was the CIA agent who assassinated the leader of the 30 April organization, but now she has decided to resign her position with the agency.  But when Carrie founds out that her husband, also a CIA agent who was presumed killed in a helicopter crash three years previously, is actually alive and has infiltrated the 30 April organization in Europe, she decides she must try to save him.<br /><br />The plot twists wildly in this thriller, and the reader quickly figures out that Carolyn doesn't know who she can trust.  The terrorist acts in the United States were plotted realistically, and I really enjoyed the story.  \\"Blown\\" is the second novel from Francine Mathews and features the same cast of characters that appeared in her first novel.  I haven't read that one yet, but I felt that Mathews did a great job of filling in the background information required from the first novel.

Amateur sleth and school psychologist Skye Denison tries to avoid getting involved in the murder investigation, but as usual, she helps sheriff Wally find the clues.  Author Swanson does a good job of tying in the town's history in providing possible motives for the murder.<br /><br />This fourth installment in Denise Swanson's Scumble River series focuses more on Skye's personal life, as she is trying to figure out her relationship with three different men in her life: her ex-finacee, Luc St. Amant, who makes a surprise re-appearance from New Orleans; her current boyfriend Simon Reid; and sheriff Wally himself.  Skye is a wonderful character who really cares about her job the only school psychologist in town, and who also prides herself on doing the right thing.<br /><br />The mystery in this story was a bit convoluted; I've liked the plot lines of other stories in this series better.  However, the description of the town's celebration is told with such humor, for me the setting made up for the hard-to-follow mystery.	2005-07-06

So she's decided to turn in her badge at Vinnie's bond agency and find a new job with more \\"career potential\\".  After a series of very funny misadventures with jobs at a button factory, a dry cleaner, and the Cluck-U-Chicken fast food joint, Stephine sort of returns to what she knows best, doing investigations on the phone and the computer with the oh-so-hot Ranger at his Rangeman company.  But Stephanie's problems with the exploding cars don't seen to go away, and after several car explosions, coupled with threatening notes and packages, she concludes that someone is stalking her. Plus, Stephanie can't really seem to get away from the bounty hunt, as she keeps volunteering to help Lula apprehend a very bad DV (Domestic Violence) fugitive.  Lula's antics as a full-fledged bounty hunter are just hysterical.<br /><br />After a somewhat disappointing episode in the tenth Stephanie Plum novel, I felt that Evanovich is totally back on track with \\"Eleven on Top.\\"  The hilarity abounds, and there's plenty of romantic tension between Stephanie and both Morelli and Ranger. There's even a good little mystery in this story, about four missing businessmen. There's an incredibly funny subplot about the planned wedding of Stephanie's sister Valerie and her boyfriend Albert Klougn (pronounced clown).  This installment is a nust-read!<br /><br />the commitment-phobic Stephanie is beginning to show some signs of finally choosing one man.

Anxious to jump-start her career by prosecuting a high-profile case like this, Melanie gets assigned to this case and finds the case is way more than she bargained for.  As the witnesses to the murder and others involved in the investigation are systematically murdered one by one, Melanie realizes that her own life is in danger.  The very policemen and investigators who are supposed to be working with her are becoming the top suspects in her murder case.<br /><br />Melanie Vargas is very likable character.  She is a Puerto Rican-Italian girl from the gang-ridden Bushwick area of New York City.  As \\"Most Wanted\\" opens, Melanie has just separated from her husband Steve,  As the story develops Melanie and Steve find they are looking for different things from their marriage, but Melanie is reluctant to get a divorce because she doesn't want her daughter to grow up in a divorced home.  But when Melanie feels undeniable sparks for her fellow investigator Dan O'Reilly, her feelings get even more confused.<br /><br />Finding out who ordered Jed Benson's murder was a bit predictable.

Their perfect vacation is rudely interrupted, though, when on the second day of their trip, another resort guest, who happens to be a beautiful single blonde, is found strangled in her deck chair.  Susan and Jed are shocked to learn that the victim is actually their friend Jerry's sister-in-law, who was frumpy and overweight when they know her ten years ago.  She has undergone a complete makeover since they last saw her, so they didn't immediately recognize her.  The local police take Jerry into custody, and Susan springs into action to try to find the real murderer.  Susan ends up spending her vacation interviewing the other resort patrons, looking for another connection between the victim and someone else on the island.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book, but frankly I had a hard time getting through it.  Although I like the four main characters in this story, the other resort visitors were fairly obnoxious characters.  And the clues that the other vacationers gave to Susan were not really pertinent to the final solution.  This book could have used a lot more action to make the plot more interesting.	2005-06-21

Kate is supposed to be gathering background information on the ship's captain Harry Gault, in order to solve the disappearance of two other crew members the previous March.<br /><br />As other reviewers indicate, the mystery is quite thinly plotted.  However, I absolutely loved the description of the hard work and danger on the crabbing ship, and the wonderful story line of Kate meeting the young Aleutian girl who showed Kate the art of storyknifing.  This is a craft where a storyteller tells a story and illustrates the tale with pictures drawn in the sand with an ivory knife.<br /><br />I liked the Alaskan setting enough to definitely read more books in this series.  If you're interested in immersing yourself in a book set in Alaska, read \\"Dead in the Water\\" for that.  Just don't read it for the mystery.	2005-06-13

Gen Bayard, an accomplished quilter, had moved away from Alpine some thirty years earlier under shady circumstances.  When an autopsy reveals that Gen was poisoned by an insulin overdose, local newspaper editor Emma Lord jumps into the murder investigation.  In addition to Gen's sudden death, there has been a rash of burglaries in the normally quiet mountain town of Alpine, and Emma wonders if the crimes are related.<br /><br />The mystery in this story was really well-plotted, and kept me guessing until the end.  I really enjoyed getting to know the cast of Alpine's residents better.  In this episode, Emma's brother Ben, who is a Catholic priest, has accepted a temporary assignment in Alpine while Father Kelley is on a sabbatical.  The interaction between Emma and Ben had some very funny moments.  We also learn a lot about Emma' House & Home Editor Vida Runkle's past.  The continuity of the characters in the Alpine stories really adds to the small town atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"The Alpine Quilt\\" is a strong addition to Mary Daheim's series of mysteries set in Alpine, Washington.  The character development and mystery plot were much stronger than the last several books in this series.  If you haven't read the other books in this series, I recommend you start with the \\"Alpine Advocate\\".  The whole Alpine series is enjoyable reading.	2005-06-12

Warren has second thoughts, though, when that evening he sees that Heather was kidnapped shortly after her reading with him.  As the story quickly develops, Warren is contacted for help by Heather's mother and finds himself involved in the search for the missing girl.  The plot kicks up another notch when Warren finds himself being framed for the murder of Heather's mother.<br /><br />The plot in this first mystery by David Skibbins was well-done, with a satisfying conclusion to the main story of kidnapping and murder.  In addition, there were a number of subplots which added to my enjoyment of this story.  The protagonist \\"Warren Ritter\\" is himself a fugitive terrorist who has been hiding from both the police and his former terrorist colleagues for thirty years.  \\"Warren\\" faked his death in a bomb explosion thirty years before the time of the story.  Warren Ritter is also afflicted with a manic-depressive personality, and the story delves a bit into the highs and lows he experiences.  Finally, author Skibbins paints a realistic picture of the Berkeley area in which the story is set.<br /><br />The story leaves plenty of unanswered questions to look at in the next book in this series.  I look forward to reading more about Warren Ritter and his quirky Berkely colleaagues.	2005-06-08

One of the perks of working for Ranger is that all his employees drive expensive black company cars, so Ranger surprises Steph with a black Porsche for her work.  Readers of the other Stephanie Plum books will know that she has terrible luck with cars, and of course the Porsche is no different.<br /><br />\\"High Five\\" is definitely the high point of the first five Stephanie Plum stories.  The action is non-stop, as Stephanie is stalked by several scary characters from her past.  Steph is also having man problems, as she broke up with boyfriend Joe Morelli in the last book, but now she's having second thoughts about him.  I'd give this book ten stars if I could!  If you haven't read this one yet, grab a copy and prepare to enjoy.	2005-06-02

Meet Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, who is the world authority in the subject of Portuguese Irregular Verbs, and in fact has written a 1600-page book on the subject.  These eight brief sketches introduce us to Professor von Igelfeld and offer the reader some amusing anecdotes.  The book's main characters are Dr. von Igelfeld and two of his colleagues, Dr. Detlef Amadeus Unterholzer and Dr. Florianus Prinzel.  The eight stories are all narrated by Dr. von Igelfeld, who relates his very funny foibles in a completely deadpan manner.<br /><br />My favorite stories were \\"Early Irish Pornography\\" and \\"Holy Man.\\"  In \\"Early Irish Pornography\\", a very young Dr, von Igelfeld accompanies his mentor to Ireland to serve as a scribe in some research on a very old Gaelic dialect.  The young German professor's observations on the Irish were very amusing.  In \\"Holy Man\\", the Professor travels to Goa to attend a language conference, and while sightseeing in the city, he encounters a holy man who gives him a dire prophesy for the future.<br /><br />This book is quite short but very entertaining.  It was a charming character study and thoroughly enjoyable.	2005-05-27

Magdelena Yoder, proprietor of the PennDutch Inn in the Amish country of Pennsylvania, is surprised when a Hollywood film crew leases her bed and breakfast to shoot a B-grade movie at the inn.  Of course, being a good Mennonite who doesn't go to the movies, Magdelena and the rest of town is thrilled.  When the movie's obnoxious assistant director is found murdered (with a pitchfork pinning him to Magdelena's barn wall), Magdalena suddenly finds herself as suspect \\"numero uno\\" in the murder.  So Magdelena puts her detecting skills to work to find the real murderer, with hilarious consequences.<br /><br />I found the characters in this book endearing and very funny.  Magdelena's Mennonit point of view puts a funny spin on many things the rest of us take for granted.  I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to the Amish country, and I look forward to reading more installments in Ms. Myers PennDutch mysteries.	2005-05-23

The words and watercolors in this book work together beautifully to convey Ms. Hinchman's careful observations of the world of The Front.  Her sketches include things as common as seed pods, animal tracks, and ice formations.  What a treasure this book is!  Reading it gave me a new appreciation for the power of keen observation of the world around me.<br /><br />This was the first artistic journal I've come across, and as a new (to me, at least) genre of book, the form impressed me.<br /><br />This is such a calming and inspiring book, one that I will enjoy reading again and again.	2005-05-23

Anna arrives in Rocky in the midst of a search for three missing teenaged girls who've been missing for over a month.  This story has another main character, forth-year old Heath Jarrod, a former rock climber who became a paraplegic in a climbing accident a few months before the time of the story.  As the book opens, Heath is trying to regain her independence, taking a night hike by herself in her wheelchair, when she stumbles upon two of the missing girls.  As the story unfolds, the reader learns of emotional and sexual abuse of these children, mostly at the hands of their \\"family\\" in their extremely conservative church.<br /><br />The character of Heath Jarrod is a well-developed one, and the reader is privy to her struggle to accept that she is wheelchair-bound, but far from helpless.  Heath finds herself taking an almost motherly interest in the two girls, which leads to her involvement in trying to find the fate of the third girl.  Of course, Anna gets involved in the mystery too.<br /><br />Each Anna Pigeon mystery presents some delightful scenery from one of America's National Parks, and this one is no exception.  Prospective readers should be warned of the very dark nature of the mystery in this story, which is not typical of the earlier books in this series.  However, the mystery was a well-told story, and author Barr does a great job with the plot.	2005-05-18

Matt now has a good job working as a paralegal in a prestigious law firm.  As the first pages of \\"The Innocent\\" unfold, Matt and his recently pregnant wife Olivia are preparing to buy a home in Matt's old hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.  When Olivia leaves town on a business trip, Matt receives two compromising photos of her with another man, but he figures out that they have been staged and someone is trying to set him up.  The key question of the story is--why is Matt being set up, and who is behind the setup? Plot details and a plethora of characters are skilfully woven together, making a fast-paced read that is hard to put down.<br /><br />Author Coben did an amazing job of pulling all the details together at the end.  Some other reviewers have noted that the plot is somewhat convoluted, but I for one really enjoyed the story.  If you're looking for an exciting, thought-provoking story, check out \\"The Innocent\\".	2005-05-09

In this installment of the \\"Booked for Travel\\" series, Lynne is taking a real vacation, with no tour group to worry about.  Of course, it seems that wherever Lynne travels, she manages to stumble upon a dead body while on one of her early morning strolls, and this trip is no different.  On her second day in Florida, Lynne discovers the body of her hostess' friend Darcy Gainesborough, and the police determine that Darcy's death appears suspicious.<br /><br />The plot of this story was thoroughly enjoyable, with just the right mix of travel tidbits and development of the mystery.  The subplots include some mischievous pranksters vandalizing the Dos Hermanas resort, some secrets that the murder victim has been hiding, and a search for some pirate treasure.  Ms. Toll skilfully weaves together all these plots with a very likable group of characters.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Lynne and Jenna's visit to Key West and the author's tongue-in-cheek description of the Margaritaville store there.<br /><br />I felt this fourth installment in the \\"Booked for Travel\\" series is the strongest one yet.  Grab yourself a copy of this book and a nice cold ice tea (or perhaps a margarita) and prepare to enjoy this tropical travel adventure!	2005-05-07

The two are thrown together in a Dublin primary school and become best buddies.  We first meet them as they are passing notes back in forth in class.  Their friendship endures many trials and tribulations, with stumbling blocks which prevent them from ever becoming \\"lovers\\".  Without spoiling any of the plot details, I'll say that the tale of their lives was touchingly told and completely heartwarming.<br /><br />What kept this from being a five-star book for me was the format, which was all in the form of notes, letters, e-mails, and instant messages.  For me, this format just didn't fully flesh out the characters as much as I would have liked.  What was charming though, is the importance in the plot of misdirected mail, something all readers can relate to!<br /><br />I loved the character of Rosie, and her ever-optimistic attitude.  This book was such an upbeat read, I would heartily recommend it.  This was my first encounter with Cecilia Ahern's writing, and I was really impressed, especially for an author of the age of only twenty-three.  I hope Ms. Ahern will pen another story to let us know what happens next to these wonderful characters.	2005-05-03

Young John Galigani, Yolanda'a former boyfriend and son of Gloria's Best friend Rose, is the number one suspect in the murder.  In this mystery, Gloria tries to find Yolanda's real murderer and clear her friend's son.<br /><br />Early in the story, a rather long list of potential suspects emerges, with motives ranging from revenge for a secret family feud, covering up some improprieties at the nuclear research facility, preventing the expansion of the town's library,  to covering up a marital infidelity.  The plot in this entry in Camille Minichino's Periodic Table mysteries is one of the best, with lots of clues offered to the reader.  I really like the main characters in this series, the physicist Dr. Gloria and her boyfriend Matt Gennaro, a policeman on the Revere police force.  Another enjoyable aspect of the story is how the author introduces the reader to scientific information about the element boron, which is a critical component in nuclear cooling systems.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, intelligent mystery with great characters, you won't be disappointed here!	2005-04-26

The destiny of the town of Empire Falls, Maine and two families who have long been residents of the town are the focus of this Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Richard Russo.  Russo does a fabulous job of building a living, pulsing town filled with real, touching characters.  The Whitings and the Robys are two families whose lives are curiously intertwined.  The rich and powerful Whiting family owns the town's now idled mill and just about every other business in town.  While the mill was open, Miles Roby's mother Grace worked there for many years, falling in love with the Whiting family patriarch, C.B. Whiting.  Fast forward to the 1990's, and the adult Miles Roby finds himself working for the widowed Mrs. Whiting, managing the Empire Grill which is owned by Mrs. Whiting.  Mrs. Whiting is a very tough, no-nonsense businesswoman, and a large part of the story revolves around Miles trying to pursue his dreams and free himself from the yoke of Mrs. Whiting.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor in this novel, provided particularly by the characters of Janine, Miles' soon-to-be-ex wife and Max, Miles' panhandling father.  Janine can't wait to finalize her divorce from Miles so she can marry the \\"Silver Fox\\", a smooth-talking man about town whose hiding a few secrets.<br /><br />I enjoyed most of this book, except for the terrible events at the end of the book.  Although the ending disturbed me, the book and its characters have remained with me long after finishing the book, a sign of a greaaat story.	2005-04-14

The outrageous pink coat that Nora Blackbird is wearing on the front cover of this book really sets the tone perfectly for this hilarious romp.  \\"Cross Your Heart and Hope to Die\\" is all about an innovative new bra design, Nora Blackbird's continuing struggle to make ends meet and make her relationship work with her boyfriend Mick Abbruzzo, and, oh yes, the murder of Nora's boss, the newspaper's high society editor Kitty Keough.  Kitty's body is found on Nora's front porch, shot execution style and trussed up with a pair of panty hose, which just happens to be a signature of an Abruzzo family hit.  Nora's boyfriend Mick Abruzzo is immediately taken to the police station for questioning, so Nora goes to work to find out who really killed Kitty Keough, and just as importantly, why Kitty was killed.  The plot is an excellent one, with lots of unexpected twists and turns.  Author Martin's descriptions of the moneyed society families of Philadelphia are great.  The resolution of the mystery was well-done and tied the many sub-plots together nicely.<br /><br />My only reservation about this book is the silly job that Nora's sister Libby has taken, which is selling adult sex toys.  There were a few good laughs in the book from this new job, but I though I should mention this sub-plot in case anyone might be offended by this subject.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next story in this series, as the reader is left with several cliffhangers about Nora's future.	2005-04-09

The book is very comprehensive in nature, with detailed descriptions of drives along ALL the roads in the park.  It turned out that during our visit in March 2005, a large number of the roads through the park were closed due to storm damage from this winter's record rains, so the book was truly a godsend in figuring out alternate routes through the park.<br /><br />Another great feature is that the authors tell you pretty accurately the condition of the roads (most of the roads are unpaved), including such important details as washed out areas, how steep are the grades, and the like.  We also really appreciated the details on what mining ruins were to be found at the end of the bumpy drives.<br /><br />We found the information in this book to be very accurate and honest, helping us to decide what we wanted to see in our way-too-short visit to the park.  This book is a great one-volume source for seeing the most when you visit Death Valley.  Enjoy!	2005-04-07

This is the second book in Ms. Starn's Million Dollar Mystery series.  The first few chapters were a bit slow to get into the story, but by Chapter Five I was hooked on Callie Webber, the fresh, witty heroine of this series and the other wonderful characters inhabiting her Chesapeake Bay world.<br /><br />Callie is a thirty-something widowed private investigator who has moved to the tranquil Chesapeake Bay area to start a new life after the tragic death of her husband in a boating accident.  Callie has a new job as an investigator for a philantropic organization called J.O.S.H.U.A., where her responsibility is to investigate charitable groups who have applied for grant money.  During a brief hiatus between assignment for J.O.S.H.U.A., Callie is doing a bit of volunteer work on her own with a local charity that helps collect career-type clothing for impoverished women.  In the course of this work, Callie befriends a recovering drug addict named Shayna Greer, who suddenly finds herself accused of the murder of her boyfriend Eddie Ray.  Shayna turns to Callie for help in proving her innocence, and Callie finds herself driven to find the real murderer.  There are many plot turns in the story, and my the second half of the book, the suspense level is very high!  Author Clark is known for her inspirational Christian writing, and while at first I was surprised with the Christian references, I found myself liking this strong, god-fearing protagonist very much.<br /><br />Callie also finds herself flirting with her good-looking neighbor Kirby Collins, while also being attracted to her mysterious boss at the J.O.S.H.U.A. foundation, Tom.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to reading the other offerings in this great series!	2005-03-31

Maddie and Wes have planned a surprise weekend getaway to the Big Island of Hawaii for themselves, Holly, Holly's best friend Liz, and Holly's four gorgeous blonde sisters.  The trouble begins, though, on the day the group is planning to leave, when Holly confides to Maddie that she was secretly married in Las Vegas on her prom night and, although she hasn't seen her husband during the eight years since then, she is apparently still married to one Marvin Dubinsky.  To make matters even worse, Holly has started to receive anonymous threatening e-mails demanding to know Marvin's location.<br /><br />Undaunted by these little problems, the group takes off for Hawaii and starts enjoying their stay at the posh Four Heavens resort.  Another strange happening, though, is that Holly finds an unknown man lurking in her room when she checks in, and she promptly conks him over the head with a lamp in the room.  That evening, the group enjoys what sounds like the best luau ever.  The next morning, however, while the group is enjoying their luxury spa treatments, Maddie learns that a body was discovered right at the same beach where the group had their luau the night before.  When Maddie discovers that the dead man is the same man who scared Holly in her room, she puts on her detecting hat to try to figure out who the man was and his connection to Holly.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the Hawaiian atmosphere and setting of this book.  The mystery presented here is one of the best-plotted story lines in all of the Madeline Bean stories.  I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book.  Even if you haven't read the other entries in this series, you'll enjoy this story.  If you're a fan of this series, you won't be disappointed!	2005-03-18

Tragedy strikes the River's Edge community again when there is a power outage one evening, and Harrison discovers that the power outage is caused by the electrocution of one of the other tenants in the building, the potter Aaron Gaston.  Harrison can't help but wonder whether or not Aaron's death is really an accident when he learns that the potter always did his work on a manual potter's wheel, and didn't use the electric wheel in his store.<br /><br />Harrison Black is a wonderful character, and in this second story we get to know him much better.  After inheriting At Wick's End, Harrison finds himself a very busy young man, with \\"a business to run, a complex to watch over, and, if time permitted, a murder to solve.\\"  Not to mention trying to find a date in Micah's Ridge.  As far as I'm concerned, the story line of \\"Snuffed Out\\" dealt a little too much with Harrison's every day schedule of running the business, and didn't spend enough time on solving the mystery.  Poof!  In the last ten pages he suddenly solves the mystery.  However, the book was fun and enjoyable.  I hope the next book in this series will spend a bit more time on developing the mystery and giving the reader some clues as well.<br /><br />The recipe for Cranberry Muffins is very good!!	2005-03-17

The geographer al-Idris also dabbled in alchemy, and the ancient objects were all used in this science.  From the first pages of the novel, I was hooked on both stories, and the pages simply flew past.<br /><br />The editorial review here on Amazon compared this book to \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but in my opinion this book is far more enjoyable.  The characterization of the Connecticut protagonists is well-done.  But my favorite part of the book is the background on the fourteen objects that were once part of the famous scholar al-Idris' library in Sicily.  I whole-heartedly disagree with the reviewer who dismissed this part of the book as \\"too much information.\\"<br /><br />Author Fasman carefully develops the plot, tying together the connection between the ancient alchemical tools and the death of the mysterious Estonian professor in Connecticut.  This story is full of beautiful prose and is a finely crafted mystery.  I'd recommend it to all.	2005-03-07

After soldiering in the bloody civil conflicts in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Mozambique, K tries to start a new life of farming in Zambia, where he lives on the farm next to Ms. Fuller's parents.  In a visit to her parents from her adopted American home, the author (nicknamed Bobo) meets the former soldier K, and on somewhat of a lark, gets him to agree to take her on a road trip back to Mozambique, to show her where he fought as a mercenary soldier.<br /><br />There are many ugly, brutal details about the African civil wars in this book.  Although the reading is painful, the message is important...war creates \\"fatal cracks\\" in both the soldiers of war and civilian bystanders, cracks which take the rest of a lifetime to repair.  Bobo undertakes this story thinking that she could better understand the violent man that K has become by \\"walking a mile in his shoes\\".  Yet the reader comes away with the lesson that war leaves a different impression on all who are involved.<br /><br />Ms. Fuller's writing is beautiful and non-judgemental.  The book is interspersed with amazing snapshots of the African people and countryside.  I definitely recommend reading Ms. Fuller's  own memoir first, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\".  And be warned that the images in \\"Scribbling the Cat\\" are quite graphic.  Nonetheless, this story is a compelling look at Africa, both today and during its civil wars of the 1980s.	2005-02-25

His job was to interview captured Arabs and try to determine which ones could give valuable intelligence information.  What was really interesting to me, though, was the author's descriptions of the war in Afghanistan and the methods used to interrogate the prisoners.  The beginning of the book describes the training that Mackey received in the Army's language school, and also touched on some of his training in interrogation methods.<br /><br />While other Amazon reviewers have commented negatively on this book for its lack of military detail, I enjoyed this book for the fact it isn't full of military acronyms and jargon like several other books I've read written on the war on terror.  To me, this book almost read like a fictional spy thriller.  I can recommend this book to other concerned citizens who are interested in learning more about how the US gathered intelligence on the war on terror.  I'm glad that I read it.	2005-02-12

On the day of club'a Chinese New Year's party, Madeline's partner Wesley shows Maddie an antique Mah-Jongg set that he found hidden in the wall of an old house that he is renovating.  Wes knows that the MJ set belonged to old Hollywood legend Dickie McBride, and he wants Maddie to return the set to McBride's widow, Quita McBride, who is a member of the Sweet and Sour MJ club.  Maddie and Wes also discover a silver dagger and a slim red book hidden in the bottom of the game case.  Before Maddie has a chance to give the MJ set to Quita, the case and everything in it is stolen from a Santa Monica farmer's market.  Running after the thief, Maddie and Wes find the MJ case in a dumpster, but the dagger and book are nowhere to be found.   As the story develops, Quita McBride is discovered dead, having fallen down a flight of stairs after the MJ party, and Maddie is convinced that Quita's death is no accident.  Maddie sets out to find out who killed Quita, and she is convinced that the missing red book will lead her to the killer. <br /> <br />This was a very well-written and funny mystery.  I loved the background about the Chinese New Year celebration, the game of Mah-Jongg,  and the culinary background of dim sum.  Madeline's love life takes another left turn, as she dumps boyfriend Arlo, and this time Maddie swears it is for good.  The final dinner shared by Arlo and Maddie is a very funny scene. <br /> <br />Every detail in this plot clicks, just like the Mah Jongg tiles in the games played throughout the story.  \\"Dim Sum Dead\\" is the strongest entry yet in the Madeline Bean series.	2005-02-07

In Minneapolis, the two lead detectives on the case, Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth, are working round the clock to find a serial murderer before he strikes again.  Very early on, they find that the murders are based on a computer game being developed by a local software company called Monkeewrench.  The murderer is playing out a series of twenty murders, exactly as they are depicted in the computer clue-finding game.  The five team members of the Monkeewrench gang quickly find themselves as the prime suspects in the murder.  The Wisconsin murder of an elderly couple in the local Catholic church at first is baffling, until the sheriff finds a clue that possibly relates this murder to the ones in Minneapolis.<br /><br />This book was tightly plotted, and the story was extremely suspenseful.  It's the kind of book that you just can't put down.  The ending was amazing, and I certainly guessed wrong about the identity of the murderer.  I can't wait to read \\"Live Bait\\", the second thriller from this mother-daughter writing team.	2005-01-31

The discovery of Eric's body launches a series of questions.  How did he gain access to the building?  Was his death an accident or murder?  Will Eric's death ruin the relationship that Harvard has with his super-rich family?<br /><br />The Harvard Business School Dean assigns one of his junior faculty members, finance professor Wim Vermeer, to return Eric's belongings to the family.  In the process, Prof. Vermeer finds himself sucked into the school and family politics surrounding Eric's death, and ultimately he ends up working with the Boston Police Captain investigating the death, Captain Barbara Brouillard.  Author Cruikshank has penned a terrific character in Prof. Wim Vermeer....a \\"not-quite-good-enough-for Harvard\\" professor who is basically a good guy.<br /><br />There are a few plot weaknesses, especially towards the end; however, the story overall was really enjoyable.  I hope Mr. Cruikshank writes a second novel featuring the further adventures of Prof. Vermeer and Capt. Brouillard.	2005-01-25

The weeks immediately preceding World War One is the time frame for Anne Perry's novel \\"No Graves as Yet.\\"  This story of espionage and murder is set in Cambridge England.  Joseph Reavley, a lecturer in Biblical Languages at Cambridge, learns the tragic news that his parents have both been killed in a car accident from his brother, Matthew, who is a member of England's Intelligence  Service.  The brothers quickly determine that their parents' death does not appear to be accidental, so they begin trying to find out who caused their car accident.  Matthew reveals that their father had telephoned him the night before he died and said that he had obtained a secret document which \\"could change the face of England forever\\". The elder Mr. Reavley was on his way to give the document to Matthew when the accident occurred.  Just a few weeks later, one of Joseph Reavley's star students is found dead in his room with a gunshot through his head.  Most of the story involves the two brothers interviewing friends of the deceased to try to determine motives for the murders.<br /><br />Anne Perry's descriptions of her characters and the English country are wonderful.  The author evokes a sense of the peace and serenity which pervaded England prior to World War One.  However, there is not much action in the story.  The first hundred pages moved very slowly.  After that, Ms. Perry introduces more information about the \\"secret document\\" that the senior Mr. Reavley allegedly had in his possession, and the pace of the story picks up a bit.<br /><br />The two brothers Joseph and Matthew were characters that I cared about.  I look forward to reading about what happens to them in the War in the next book in this series.	2005-01-17

Janice has just written a best-selling novel set in Hawaii, and she is working to find a Hawaiian location to film a movie of her novel.  Her foster sister Lily is returning to visit her very large extended family, but the reader soon discovers that Lily is also on the trip to keep an eye on her friend Janice.<br /><br />Janice has been invited to stay in the home of family friends Luther and Maude Avery.  The Averys own a large estate near Honolulu, which includes a native Hawaiian village which is the location that Janice would like to use for her movie.  Janice must keep her movie-making plans a secret, though, until she gets the Hawaiian villagers to agree.  However, immediately upon her arrival in Honolulu, Janice is warned by her native friends that her host's home is a dangerous and unhappy place and she shouldn't stay there.  On her second day in Hawaii, Janice discovers the body of a beautiful young hula dancer, apparently a drowning victim in a cove on her host's estate.  A series of apparent mishaps gets the attention of amateur detective Lily Wu, who comes to the aid of Janice and identifies who was behind the drowning of the hula dancer.<br /><br />This was an extremely enjoyable book, and it was hard for me to believe that the book was written more than 50 years ago.  I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Lily Wu's Chinese family.  \\"The Kahuna Killer\\" is the second novel in the \\"Lily Wu quartet\\", a group of four novels featuring Janice Cameron and Lily Wu.  I am very glad to have discovered the Rue Morgue Press, which is publishing a number of \\"classic\\" murder mysteries popular during before 1960.  This particular edition was a joy to read and well-edited.	2005-01-13

In the book, F.L.Y. stands for \\"Finally Loving Yourself\\".  Rather than try to fit you into a cookie cutter program, this book encourages you to make routines that work for you, and then stick to them.<br /><br />The author also gives a lot of really helpful advice, such as identifying hot spots in your home that constantly accumulate junk, and how to control these areas.<br /><br />This book was really supportive.  Many other organizational books assume that disorganized people are just failures, whereas this book points out that being organized is a leanred skill.

It turns out that Stephanie and Lulu with their bad luck of being in the wrong place at the wrong time have interrupted a hold-up of the store, and the Molotov cocktail intended for the store ends up destroying yet another of Stephanie's cars.  However, Stephanie gets a glimpse of the gang member who torched her car, and then she learns that his Gang, the Red Devils, is out to silence her, permanently.<br /><br />After she finds out that she's on the gang's hit list, Stephanie goes into hiding, ultimately spending most of the book hiding in fellow bounty hunter Ranger's apartment.  I felt that there wasn't nearly as much action in this story as in the previous Stephanie Plum books.  Plus, I did get tired of Stephanie moaning about her weight gain one minute, then eating a dozen doughnuts the next minute.<br /><br />I honestly couldn't recommend this book to a reader unfamiliar with the Stephanie Plum series.  \\"Ten Big Ones\\" just doesn't pack the laughs and zany action of the other books.  However, the last few pages are great, vintage Stephanie Plum.  I just wish the rest of the book was of the same caliber.	2005-01-02

Annie, who is always fond of sponsoring contests in her store, has come up with a special promotion for Emma's book signing.  The special contest is a challenge to identify nine mysteries and their authors, based on clues given in an advertising flyer which Annie has distributed around the island.  However, several days before the signing event, another set of mysterious flyers appear on Broward's Rock Island which appear as if Annie is accusing some of her neighbors or murder and other crimes as part of her contest.  In order to clear the name of her store, Annie and her husband Max set out to find the real author of the fake contest flyers.<br /><br />I felt that the first half of this book moved pretty slowly.  I did enjoy Ms. Hart's wonderful descriptions of the South Carolina swamps and wildlife.  The pace of the story picked up for the last one hundred pages or so, when two island residents are found brutally murdered.  Together with her friend Henny, Annie and Max try to discover if the flyers are related to the murders, or if the flyers were just a smoke screen to divert attention from the real murderer.<br /><br />All in all, this was an enjoyable read.  The many subplots in the book are all neatly tied up in the end, and there are many clues to send the reader down the wrong path in figuring out whodunit.	2005-01-01

Being somewhat of an amateur sleuth herself, Lucy tries to find out who murdered Mr. Miller.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the mystery aspect of this story, because the reader is not really privy to many clues to the murder.  It seems that the solution just pops out of thin air!  I love the character of Lucy Stone, though, and her cozy town of Tinker Cove.  The holiday traditions in the story, including a community cookie exchange, are just right to get the reader in the Christmas spirit!  Author Meier has created a believable town and likable protagonist.  I would recommend this book more as a cozy seasonal story, with just a touch of mystery in it.	2004-12-24

What can I read now that will compare with this?  This is Jennifer Weiner's third novel, all set in her hometown of Philadelphia, and her best effort yet.  \\"Little Earthquakes\\" follows four women, all recently new mothers, through their shaky adjustments to motherhood.<br /><br />Weiner does a great job of character development with the four main characters.  The book is set up in twelve sections, covering from April of one year to March of the following year.<br /><br />The first character we meet is Lia, a fairly successful actress in Hollywood who returns to her hometown of Philly after losing her 10-week old son to SIDS.  The death of her child has devastated Lia, and she leaves her husband with no word of where she has gone.  Lia, who used to be named Lisa, had left Philadelphia at the age of 18 and had told her husband Sam that her family had all been killed in a car accident.  I loved the character of Lia.  At first I thought she was just a nut case; however, Weiner does a fantastic job of chronicling Lia's struggle with grief and depression.<br /><br />The three other main characters in the book meet in a pre-natal yoga class.  They are Ayinde, a beautiful bi-racial woman married to Philadelphia 76er superstar Richard Towne; Becky, an overweight Jewish chef; and Kelly, a perpetually perky party-planner.<br /><br />Ayinde, Becky, and Kelly each experience troubles in their lives that we are all familiar with.  However, coupled with the arrival of a new baby, the troubles are magnified.  Ayinde must deal with a surprising infidelity from her husband when a young woman in Phoenix alleges that she is pregnant with Richard's child.  Becky, whose life seems almost perfect, has to deal with an overbearing mother-in-law.  Kelly's husband has been laid off, and Kelly is frustrated by his lack of motivation in looking for a new job.<br /><br />As a final note, I must say that the character of Mimi, Becky's mother-in-law, is one of the funniest characters I've met in a long while.  Mimi is a five-times divorced Jewish matron who insists on buying her grand-daughter slutty baby outfits that say things like \\"hottie\\".  The final crisis in Becky and Mimi's relationship is precipitated by Mimi's insistence on Becky and her husband (both Jewish) celebrating Christmas, complete with a Christmas tree.<br /><br />You'll want to share this book with all your friends.

Bobo Fuller was born in England in 1969, and her family returned to what was then Rhodesia several years later, where her father worked as the overseer of a farm.  Bobo recalls her life in Africa until she left to attend college in Canada.  The period when the Fuller family lived in Africa was a time of great upheaval and strife throughout the continent, as one by one the African countries threw off their British reins and began governing themselves.  Against this extreme political turmoil, Bobo tells of her own family's struggles to overcome the deaths of three children, her mother's fight with alcohol and depression, and constant health threats from malaria and parasites.  Yet through all the challenges, Bobo is resolved in her own love of the African land and its wildness.<br /><br />The Fuller family lived on a farm in Rhodesia (which became Zimbabwe during their stay there) for eight years.  Their farm actually bordered on Mozambique, which was undergoing a civil war of its own.  I can't imagine going out horseback riding in a land studded with land mines, but this gave the Fullers very little pause.  There are family photographs throughout the book, which did so much to make the book more personal.  I especially enjoyed the picture of little Bobo leaving for boarding school at age 8, proudly holding an Uzi for protection on the drive to school.<br /><br />After Zimbabwe, the family moved to Malawi for two years, and then onto Zambia.  In spite of what sounds like terrible conditions, Fuller tells her family's story, which is often tragic, with a great deal of humor.  I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir and look forward to reading her next book \\"Scribbling the Cat.\\"	2004-12-10

The group has stopped to spend the night in the ruin of a church in an abandoned village, and, of course, the Priest's tale is set in a similar church.<br /><br />The ghost story takes place in the English town of Scawsby, which is located near the southeastern coast of England.  In the year 1308, a band of warrior knights of the Templar order mysteriously disappeared on the moors near Scawsby, and it's rumored that the knights were transaporting a fabulous treasure. The main character in the ghost story is a priest named Phillip, who is assigned to the church in Scawsby, only to learn that the last four priests who held that position before him all went mad.  In fact, his immediate predessor hung himself from a tree.  Father Phillip finds that there are haunting eyes painted all over the church, and he and his brother (a fellow priest) hear mysterious voices chanting \\"We are watching you, we are always watching you.\\"  Phillip tries to get to the bottom of the mystery, so the people of Scawsby can be freed from the ghostly haunting.<br /><br />Authoer Doherty did a great job with the medieval setting.

When she was only twenty-two years old, Tami Oldham Ashcraft and her fiancee Richard Sharp took on a job to deliver a yacht from Tahiti to San Diego.  Both Tami and Richard were experienced sailors, with over 50,000 miles of blue water sailing between them.  What should have been a pleasant adventure turned into disaster though, on Day 19 of the trip, when the two were unable to outrun Hurricane Raymond.  The two sailors fought bravely to escape the storm, but to Tami's horror, she woke up after what she thought was a brief sleep below decks, only to discover that the ship was filling up with water, and Richard apparently was washed overboard, his D-ring having broken open.  What follows is a remarkable story of determination, faith, and dealing with a lost love, as Tami survives forty-one days on her own and manages to navigate the demasted ship to Hilo, Hawaii.<br /><br />In addition to telling the story of her survival , Tami includes reflections on the trip she and Richard had taken to Tahiti just before they started their fateful trip back to California.  This book did such a great job of conveying the romance of the sea and long ocean voyages.  Unlike some other tales of surviving disasters, Tami is completely humble in her telling of the story.

This book also introduces the original \\"Bob the Dog.\\"  THe character of Daisy isn't nearly as sassy as Stephanie Plum, but she's very sweet.  This was a quick read, but very enjoyable and funny.	2004-11-05

This book takes the reader through the long process of investigating these murders and also details quite a bit about each of the GRK's victims.  The way that Ann Rule includes biographical information on each victim really helps to humanize them, making the reader realize that Gary Ridgeway murdered forty-seven individuals, each with a family who cared about her and dreams for a better future.  It's true that a large majority of the victims were prostitutes, but many were forced into this life because they had no other options.  Ann Rule's interviews with family members paints a picture of the young lives that were so brutally cut short. Many of the victims were trying to turn their lives around and never got the opportunity to change their lifestyles. It's amazing that the GRK was able to lead a seemingly normal life for so many years in the south Seattle community before he was apprehended.<br /><br />This was a fast-paced and interesting account of solving a series of terrible murders.  Ann Rule's books are always interesting, but this one is one of her best!	2004-10-17

After Eric is found shot to death in his physics lab, we learn that he has found a fatal flaw in the data which could discredit the team's findings.  Was Eric murdered to keep him quiet, or was it for another reason?<br /><br />This very enjoyable novel introduces Dr. Gloria Lamerino, a recently retired physicist who has returned to her hometown of Revere, Massachusetts after a successful physics career in California.  Gloria is hired by the Revere police department as a scientific consultant to help understand the scientific background of the case.

In this story, Gloria is pursued by her former high school flame Peter Mastrone, while SHE is interested in getting to know the police detective Sergeant Gennaro much bettter.<br /><br />The plot development was well done, making this book a real page-turner.

This novel tells the life story of Nella Castelluca, the middle daughter of five, who lives on her family's small farm just outside of Roseto.  Nella aspires to move away from the farm, live in town, and become a teacher.  When Nella is 13, she gets her wish and is able to attend the high school in Roseto, where she excels at her studies.  Shortly after she begins the school in town, Nella meets the mysterious Renato Lanzara and finds herself attracted to him.  At first,Nella doesn't take her attraction to Renato seriously, because he is seven years older.  Nella's father is badly injured in an accident, and Nella's loyalty to her family leads her to leave school and take a job in a blouse factory in town.  Much to Nella's surprise, she also proves to be an excellent worker and manager, and is promoted to the position of forewoman in the factory when she is only 16 years old.

The story goes on, but I don't want to say any more to ruin your enjoyment of it.  Nella's family overcomes a variety of tragedies, that at times seemed like more bad luck than one family should have to endure.  The Castelluca family's ties are of course strengthened by every trial the family endures.<br /><br />In spite of the somewhat maudlin story line, I really enjoyed this book.  The enduring theme of the book is that real love never dies.  The book was a moving, warm, and heartfelt tale.hat real love never dies.  The book was a moving, warm, and heartfelt tale.	2004-10-01

A town resident has discovered dead chickens with  piles of coins nearby.  Another resident has discovered one of his goats killed, also with a pile of money nearby.  To make matters even worse, China Bayles' friend Ruby Wilcox has started teaching a class on reading tarot cards.  Then a Bible-thumping preacher arrives in Pecan Springs and starts accusing Ruby of devil worship.  Are all these strange happening due to Ruby's witchcraft, or are they the work of Mexican santerias?<br /><br />On Halloween night, one of the women in Ruby's tarot class holds an all-woman Halloween party. Then the hostess is discovered brutally murdered the next morning.  The travelling minister suggests that Ruby is the prime suspect of the murder, so China goes to work to find the real killer.<br /><br />\\"Witches' Bane\\" is the second book in the China Bayles series by Susan Wittig Albert.  This is a fast-moving, interesting mystery, with great twists at the end.  There are lots of facts included about growing herbs and other plants.  China is such a smart, down-to-earth heroine and very likable.  I highly recommend this book, both to fans of the China Bayles series as well as readers looking for a fun Halloween-themed mystery.	2004-09-24

After a year in Kahili, she is then sent to the Kalaupapa leper colony on Molokai.  The story of Rachel and her new family on Molokai is beautiful, inspirational and very uplifting.<br /><br />Character development is very strong in this story.  The figure of Sister Catherine Voorhies was perhaps my favorite of the whole story, as she deals with her own personal demons as well as her own doubts of \\"Why does God give children leprosy?\\"  This story is so wonderful as Rachel and her new-found 'ohana (family) rise above their disease and find dignity and love in their isolated home.<br /><br />Simply one of the most moving and enjoyable books I've read in a very long time.	2004-09-21

While attending a band rehearsal before the dance, Skye becomes worried because the band members seem to be fighting amongst themselves.  During the Valentine dance, a fire breaks out in the gymnasium where the dance is being held.  After the fire is brought under control, a charred body is found by the stage.  The victim turns out to be one of the members of the band, and the local police chief seems to be focussing on Vince as his prime murder suspect.  With her proven track record in solving the town's mysteries, naturally Skye tries to solve the murder in order to clear her brother.<br /><br />There have been quite a few strange occurrences in Scumble River of late, with the school fire being just the latest of them.  Skye begins to suspect that some of the high school students may be taking drugs, which could account for their bizarre actions.  So in addition to looking for a murderer, Skye finds herself searching for a meth lab as well.  Also, a slick promoter named Moss Gibson has rolled into town to try to build a new amusement park, and Mr. Gibson is trying to get the local residents to sell their farmland to him.  There's lots going on in Scumble River!<br /><br />This series is really enjoyable in the way it depicts small town life, where everybody knows everybody else.  One of the funny storylines in this book is how Skye and her new boyfried Simon must sneak around the town to keep their relationship out of the gossip mill.<br /><br />All the different storylines are well tied together at the end, but certainly kept me guessing about the murderer's identity.	2004-09-13

In this first book from St. Louis author Rett MacPherson, we meet Torie and her family.  Torie is married to Rudy and has two little girls.  Torie also works as a tour guide of the historic buildings in her home town of New Kassel, even dressing in vintage clothing while giving her tours.  Torie is also an avid genealogist.  As the story opens, she is hired to prepare a family tree for town resident Norah Zumwalt.  Norah has an interesting family mystery, which is that her father went off to World War II and was never heard from again--no official death record from the war or anything.  After finding some interesting information which she wants to share with her client, Torie is horrified when she goes to Norah's house, finds the front door ajar, and discovers that Norah has been savagely murdered.<br /><br />Being naturally inquisitive (or is it nosy?) Torie wonders if there is some secret in Norah's family tree that led to her murder.  Throughout the story, Torie works with the county sheriff to find out the identity of the murderer.  The plot is a good one, with lots of turns.<br /><br />I enjoyed the genealogy aspect of the story too.  I'm looking forward to reading Torie's next adventure in family history.	2004-08-31

Stefan claims he was hired to dig up the bones from a 25-year old grave in the Monterey cemetery.  Unfortunately for Stefan, in the process of digging up the grave, he encounters a fresh corpse wrapped in plastic garbage bags, shallowly buried above the casket he was hired to plunder.  After removing the bones from the old grave (and leaving the fresh body where he found it), Stefan is apprehended by the Monterey police for a defective tail-light on his car, and the police find the skeleton in his back seat.  One thing leads to another, and Stefan finds himself on trial for the murder of the woman found in the grave, as well as a grand theft charge for pocketing a valuable medal from the grave.<br /><br />Enter attorney Nina O'Reilly, who has returned to Monterey at the request of her first employer, Klaus Pohlmann.  Klaus is now well over eighty years old, and has asked Nina to sit as second chair on this trial.  Nina decides to accept this temporary move back to her hometown of Carmel, in order to help out her old friend Klaus, as well as to test her relationship with longtime love Paul von Wagoner.<br /><br />At the very beginning of the book, Paul proposes to Nina, and she tentatively accepts his ring, although she declines to give Paul a firm answer.  Throughly this novel, Nina shares her conflicted emotions about marrying Paul and staying in Carmel permanently, leaving her beloved Tahoe behind her.<br /><br />The legal case is an interesting one, although because Nina was given inadequate time to prepare for the trial, the defense strategy is quite jumpy.  The most interesting part of the case is the alleged connection of the two murder victims to the Russian tsar Nicholas' family.  There is a lot of detail here about the last days of the Romanov family, which was fascinating.<br /><br />This is the tenth novel in the Nina O'Reilly series, and while I enjoyed the story very much, I felt that the authors didn't provide a whole lot of background on Nina's family and law practice in Tahoe, which I think would make this book less enjoyable for readers not familiar with the other books in this series.

In this third installment of Maddy Hunter's \\"Passport to Peril\\" series, Emily's group of quirky Iowans has been booked for the tour along with a group of wannabe romance writers.  Emily seems to be a magnet for misadventures while on vacation.  This story opens with the group's hotel burning to the ground.  After relocating the tourists to another hotel, one of the aspiring roman writers is found dead, apparently having fallen down a flight of stairs int he hotel hallway.  When a second member of the romance writers' group accidentally falls to her death while sightseeing in a church, Emily begins to wonder if these deaths are really accidents, or if there is a murdered amidst the group.<br /><br />Most of the humor in this book is in the form of poking fun at romance novels.  Two of the romance writers on the tour are fierce rivals, and some of the dialogue between these two is wickedly funny.  There are also some amusing characterizations of \\"ugly American\\" tourists abroad.  However, most of the characters in this story just weren't well-enough developed for me to really care about them.  Emily's ex-husband Jack (now known as \\"Jackie\\", after undergoing a sex-change operation) is also along on the tour.  I found Jackie to be a really annoying character.<br /><br />Hopefully, future stories in this series will feature more plot and development of the secondary characters.	2004-08-16

Plus, she discovers some interesting connections between the murder victims and some overpriced art being sold in a local gallery......Could she have discovered  another fradulent scheme??<br />Well, I won't say any more about the plot except that it is a fabulous, twisting ride!

The story develops rapidly from there.<br />Along with solving the Mossman murder, Joanna is kept busy juggling many other personal and professional responsibilities.  Shortly after the murder is discovered, Joanna realizes a happy surprise--she is pregnant!  Joanna is also swamped with campaign obligations in her quest for re-election as sheriff of Cochise County.  Then another incident happens in Cochise County where a car loaded with 20 illegal immigrants overturns and many are killed in the accident.  And did I mention that all this happens over the Fourth of July holiday weekend?  Ms. Jance continues to develop all the characters introduced in the series so far.  However, even if you are new to this series, you should have no trouble picking up the story and the characters.<br />It seemed ironic to me that the general public of Cochise County cared more about the dogs who died in Carol Mossman's overheated trailer than the score of immigrants hurt or killed in a car accident.  Not only was this novel a very enjoyable mystery, but the author's comments on &quot;hoarding&quot; and smuggling immigrants across the border illegally were good points.<br />With all that is going on in Joanna Brady's life, the next story in this series is bound to be another great read!	2003-08-21

In this story, Lousiana police detective Dave Robicheaux is searching for clues to solve the murders of two women.  Are the two murders related?  One of the prime suspects is Legion Guidry.  Legion is an evil demon through and through.  He is a former overseer on a plantation in southern Louisiana and has a shameful history. Burke does a wonderful job developing the character of Legion and other interesting players in the story.<br />The other evil demon is Robicheaux's continuing struggle to beat alcholism.  Robicheaux flirts briefly with addiction to ampehtamines in his own battle with the bottle.<br />James Lee Burke does a great job of sharing the thoughts of the police detective with us.  As always in his books, his descriptions of the Lousiana bayous are fabulous.  You can really feel the humidity and hear the haunting sounds of the bayou.<br />I think this book would make a great movie.  It has it all--great setting, great plot, and memorable characters.  A real five-star read.	2003-07-24

Anna's friend Freida has been injured while on an exploration trip inside of Lechguilla, and Freida has requested Anna to be with her during the rescue.<br />I enjoyed this Anna Pigeon mystery a lot.  The descriptions of the cave were marvelous.  Barr does a great job of evoking the fear that Anna Pigeon feels, being in the cave while fighting back her own extreme sense of claustrophobia.  It's true that there is a lot of technical details on the equipment used in caving, but I felt that this description served to add to the tension and sense of urgency that the rescuers were feeling.  The suspense in this story was well developed.  For a majority of the book, Anna is one of the few people who suspects foul play in her friend's injury.<br />The characters in the caving crew were interesting and well-developed.  All in all, this is a fun read.	2003-06-27

In \\"Las Vegas Comp: Murder at the Emerald Towers\\", we meet detective Fargo Blue, retired Las Vegas cop turned private eye.  Fargo's assignment in this story is to recover a large amount of cash owed to his beautiful poker-playing client, nicknamed \\"Pleasure.\\"  The story quickly turns into a murder mystery, though, when a woman is found murdered by the pool in the Emerald Towers casino.  Fargo finds himself as the prime suspect in the murder.  The story twists and turns through glittery Las Vegas, and features a jewel heist, another murder and several secret identities.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the Las Vegas setting. In addition to Fargo Blue, the McKenzie Borthers introduce several other interesting characters, including Fargo's partner, Sherri, who is a former coast guard sailor, and Uncle Leo, horse addict and attorney who shares an office with Fargo and Sherri.<br />The book contains an excerpt of the next Fargo Blue mystery, which looks like another great page turner.  If you're looking for a fresh gumshoe, I highly recommend checking out this story!	2003-05-21

While Ave Maria Mulligan was growing up in the tight-knit Appalachian mining town of Big Stone Gap, she considered herself a &quot;ferriner&quot;, because her mother came from Italy.  When we meet Ave Maria in this first book of Adriana Trigiani's trilogy, she has just celebrated her 35th birthday. She owns the Mutual Pharmacy in Big Stone Gap and is the town's pharmacist.  Ave Maria is the town's &quot;Old Maid&quot;, but as the book opens, we find out that she is expecting something exciting to happen to her soon.  One of Ave Maria's hobbies is the art of Chinese face reading, and Ave Maria knows from studying her facial features that changes will be coming her way soon.  This novel is a wonderful story of what happens when she learns of a big secret shortly after her mother dies.  Ave Maria must re-evaluate her whole life and decide what's really important to her.  As she examines her own life, she learns about love as she is the recipient of two marriage proposals in the course of just a few weeks.  The story really kept me turning the pages to find out what happens next!<br />I enjoyed all the other characters that Trigiani included in the story.  Iva Lou, the Bookmobile lady, was particularly well-described and was never at a loss for advice when dealing with men.<br />As much as I enjoyed the book, I am only giving it four stars, because I thought some of the plot twists were a little too &quot;convenient&quot;.  I am eagerly anticipating reading &quot;Big Cherry Holler&quot;, though, to find out what happens to Ave Maria next.  Trigiani does a great job of building a wonderful female protaganist that I really cared about.<br />Claire E.	2003-03-13
US	52715445	R3CZN5JI0K6SXQ	037550169X	437002233	Charlotte Gray: A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Interesting story about French Resistance in World War II	This is the story of Charlotte Gray, a young woman from Scotland who volunteers to work with a British intelligence organization in support of the French Resistance.  The book opens with Charlotte's arrival in London, where she begins working in an unfulfilling job as a secretary in a doctor's office.  On her train ride to London, she meets a British intelligence officer who tells her that her fluency with the French language would be a great asset in support of the French resistance movement.  At first, Charlotte does not take this opportunity seriously, but when her new beau Peter Gregory is shot down somewhere over France, she decides to volunteer, motivated both by her desire to help the British war effort as well as to find out what happened to Peter.  As the story unfolds, her efforts to find Peter fall by the wayside as she becomes more involved in trying to help the French people who are resisting German occupation.<br />Key to the story is the arrest of the parents of two young Jewish boys, efforts by the villagers to hide the boys from the Germans, and their eventual capture.  This part of the novel was fascinating. Faulks has obviously done a lot of research into conditions at the holding camps that were set up for Jews in occupied France.  The story set in the concentration camp was truly heart-wrenching.<br />Several other reviewers dismissed this book as \\"pointless\\".  However, I enjoyed it very much.  The story was great, and I feel that the message of the book was Charlotte's growth throughout the novel. We first see Charlotte as a rather silly young woman (at the start of the book) whose greatest concern is what cocktail party to attend on a given evening.  At the novel's close, she is much more concerned about helping people survive the horrors of war.	2003-02-05

The book opens as Alex and John Sampson try to prove the innocence of an old buddy of Sampson's, who's on death row for a grisly murder of three women in North Carolina.  We follow Alex and John through a series of new murders as they try to find the killers and their motive.<br />This was the first Alex Cross mystery I've read.  I can see that other reviewers liked some of the previous Alex Cross novels better than this one.  I found the unravelling of the mystery to be credible, but I was somewhat appalled by the large number of murder victims who were \\"collateral damage.\\"  I can't recall a mystery I've read recently with more dead bodies in it.  I found the short chapters somewhat irritating, as there was very little character development that occurred in this story.<br />I might go back and read the earlier Alex Cross stories.  This one certainly assumed that the reader had a lot of background information on Alex's old cases.	2003-01-21
US	52715445	R12M3NEUI9EFZC	060980619X	849421589	God Save the Sweet Potato Queens	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Not trying to be another "Ya-Ya" Book	Jill Conner Browne's \\"God Save the Sweet Potato Queens\\" continues to dispense her sassy yet sweet advice on live, life, men, marriage and being prepared.  Readers were introduced to Jill and her bevy of Tammys in \\"The Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love,\\"  and the fun continues here.  New subjects added in the sequel include \\"revirgination\\", and \\"How to be a Girl\\".<br />In response to the review which negatively compare this book to \\"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\", I don't believe it's fair at all to compare the two books.  This book is not fiction at all, rather, it is a cross between humor and a handbook.  The anecdotes in this book are based on real life, with only a teensy bit of exaggeration.<br />I laughed on almost every page of this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story about the \\"rubber chicken and schnozzes\\" theme wedding.  Read this book, I dare you not to laugh too!<br />Colorado ...	2002-09-20
US	52715445	ROI0U5BXWWUEO	0312977158	67719251	Remember Your Lies	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Suspense, Romance, and Voodoo	Angela Donahue, a former Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent, left her law enforcement career five years earlier, when an undercover drug operation went dreadfully wrong and she was shot.  Now, Angela has recovered and has a successful new career as a tour operator in her home town of historic Savannah.  Suddenly, Angela finds herself in the Savannah police station, accused of the murder of the wealthy J.J. Slade, a man she claims she's never met.<br /><br />The storyline develops quickly, as several other suspects in J.J. Slade's murder emerge.  Slade's daughter Veronica is a key suspect, as well as a local drug lord who has just gotten out of prison.<br /><br />I enjoyed the inclusion of voodoo in the story. Ms. Jones begins each chapter with an excerpt from a fictional book of voodoo.  The eerie voodoo-related happenings really added a lot to the suspense of the story.<br /><br />The resolution of who killed J.J. Slade was very suspenseful.  I was guessing \\"whodunit\\" until the very last page.	2002-08-28

As the book opens, Nina seems to be on top of her Lake Tahoe world, with both her personal and professional lives moving forward smoothly. Nina finally feels accepted by the Lake Tahoe legal community. The book opens with a nasty child custody case, where Nina is representing the father of two children, who is also a local policeman on the Lake Tahoe police force. It looks like Nina will win this tricky custody case, until the theft of her car from her driveway. One small mistake on Nina's part, leaving her briefcase in the car over night, which contains three client intake files, leads to confidential information being leaked out. In the short course of a weekend, three cases that seemed very straightforward turn into cases with life-threatening implications. Nina winds up in front of the California State Bar, with three counts of legal malpractice made against her.<br />The pace of this book was wonderful, I simply couldn't put it down. The O'Shaughnessy sisters do a great job of bringing life to their characters, and this story was no exception. In \\"Unfit to Practice\\", they do a great job of developing Nina's relationship with Paul, her investigator, and also of developing her son Bob's character some more.<br />The plot resolution was very believable. I don't want to spoil the outcome of the book, but I will say that \\"Unfit to Practice\\" really leaves the reader waiting for the next Nina Reilly book.	2002-08-13

Initially, Stephanie thinks this should be an easy job, since Uncle Mo is one of the burg's most popular residents and has run a candy shop there for many years. The job rapidly turns ugly, though, because her friends and family can't believe that Stephanie would actually try to put such a \\"nice guy\\" in jail. But of course, there's more to Uncle Mo than meets the eye. It turns out that he's somehow involved in a suspicious string of murders of drug dealers in the burg. As Stephanie tries to track down Uncle Mo, she gets involved with the murders, even personally discovering a couple of dead bodies herself.<br />I love the hysterical characters and situations in this book! \\"Three to Get Deadly\\" develops the character of Lula, former hooker and now a co-worker of Stephanie's at Vinnie's bond agency. Lula can sure talk some trash, but when put in a sticky situation you can practically see her knees knocking together, as she hightails it off the scene. Read the book to find out what happens with the body that Lula and Stephanie find in the dumpster. I couldn't stop laughing!! Also, I loved the character of Mrs. Steeger, Stephanie's third grade teacher who is ( of course) Uncle Mo's neighbor. Didn't we all have a teacher just like her?<br />The twists and turns in unravelling Uncle Mo's connection to the drug dealer murders were well plotted. The case gets solved in the last 20 pages, and I thought Ms. Evanovich tied all the loose ends up very nicely.<br />Darn skippy, Janet Evanovich has written another humdinger! Four and a half stars.	2002-08-02

Rookie bounty hunter Stephanie Plum returns to Trenton's \\"burg\\" in the second installment of Janet Evanovich's action-filled series. This story revolves around Stephanie's efforts to find the fugitive Kenny Mancuso, who is on the lam, accused of the murder of his high school friend Moogie. The story twists and turns through Stephanie's New Jersey neighborhood as Steph and her cop friend (and hopeful lover) Joe Morelli seem to be constantly one step behind Kenny. To liven up the story, Kenny sends Stephanie and her family members a number of threats, in order to encourage her to give up the chase.<br />The action in this novel is fast-paced. There's a lot of humor too, as Stephanie tries to deal with her meddling mother. Stephanie's Grandma Mazur emerges in this second novel as a quirky and very \\"hip\\" grandma who is essential to Stephanie's case.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this story and can't wait to read the rest of the Stephanie Plum books.	2002-07-18

I particularly liked the author's reviews of the accomodations within the park, which I found to be accurate, especially his reviews of the accomodations at the Old Faithful area, Canyon, and Lake Yellowstone.<br />The book contains excellent, accurate maps and the descriptions of touring the park contain lots of little-known sites that were worth seeing.  Also, the book contains great information on hikes within the park.<br />I looked at several other guides to Yellowstone, this one by far outshines the other ones that I saw.<br />Enjoy your visit to this wonderful park!	2002-06-03
