'OLYMPIC JUDO: Ground Work Techniques' demonstrated entry methods into matwork, such as tai-otoshi into juji-gatame (p. 18); or Seoi-nage into Sode Goruma [sic] jime (p. 78).  The book also demonstrated on page twelve the 'Rolling juji-gatame' the variation (kazure) on juji-gatame which the author used to win his 1981 World Championship.    Clearly demonstrating eight techniques with several variations and combinations from tachi-waza in a professional and objective manner, 'OLYMPIC JUDO: Ground Work Techniques' is an unusually instructive manual on matwork by a gifted Newaza practitioner.  Chapter Seven, Variations on strangles, is particularly worth studying; and this insightful manual also contained two full chapters on Sankaku-jime and its variations.    World Judo Champion and author, Neil Adams, in his book: 'OLYMPIC JUDO: Ground Work Techniques' has produced a very good informative manual on Judo matwork and shared detailed descriptions of eight of his Tokui Waza which helped him become a successful Judo competitor.  As a good Newaza companion to this work, please read: FIGHTING JUDO (c. 1985) by Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki, for further knowledge on the effectiveness of Judo matwork.	2004-11-09

A training manual written in the form of a story, the book: 'SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS: A Folk Novel of China' (c. 1990) translated by Eva Wong, introduced the reader to a blend of myth and history to both entertain and teach, in the form of lectures, the Taoist philosophy of Wang Ch'ung-yang and Ch'iu Ch'ang-ch'un.  History had recorded that the disciple \\"Ch'iu Ch'ang-ch'un was befriended by Kublai Khan and was appointed court high priest during the reign of the first Yu'an Emporer\\" (p.xvii). And Wang Ch'ung-yang lived during the Sung (1127-1279) and Yu'an (1271-1368) dynasties.<br /><br />Wang Ch'ang-yang (the rebirth of yang, or the rejuvenation of mind & body) was regarded as one of the greatest patriarchs of the school of True Reality (or the school of Complete Reality) and his students, the seven Taoist masters, were of the Northern School of Taoism, that branch of Taoism which advocates the 'singular path', where enlightenment and immortality are achieved through meditation and chi-kung exercises, it is the closest to Buddhism and Ch'an meditation of the Taoist sects.  Ch'iu Ch'ang-ch'un, one of the seven masters, founded the Lung-men (Dragon Gate)sect of Taoism.<br /><br />SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS presentd a mix of myth and history in the most appealing way to the reader conforming to the Taoist pedagogy of story telling to instruct as more accessible in an intuitive reading than as analytic reading of a text.  The main character, Wang Ch'ung-yang, was approached by two immortals, Lu and Chung-li Ch'uan, dressed as beggars, who had to convert mortals into Taoist immortals before the flowering of the immortal peach so that the Empress of Heaven wouldn't have to eat it alone.  While Buddhism emphasizes reincarnation, Taoism strives for immortality, by means of internal alchemy, the actual transformation of body & soul through various Taoist efforts and personal sacrifices of the apprentice.<br /><br />So in the SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS, the experiences of Wang Ch'ung-yangare used as a vehicle to describe the attitudes and situations for Taoist training and the obstacles usually encountered on the road to enlightenment.  The seven Taoist masters each represent seven different approaches to the Tao, and each master must negotiate an obstacle in their own way on the path to enlightenment.  In this particular theology of Taoism is the belief that destiny can be changed by the actions of people, reward and retribution will be given according to one's behaviour.<br /><br />The book, SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS, contained a number of typographical and grammatical errors, such as \\"propserous\\" (p. 89), and \\"emerge\\" for merge throughout the work, and a number of ancient Chinese woodblock illustrations; yet overall, this is an excellent introduction to the Northern School of Taoism using a primer originally written for the training of Taoists priests.  Also, please read TAOIST MASTER CHUANG (c. 2000) by Michael R. Saso, to gain further insight into the life and training of a Taoist disciple.	2004-10-20

Saso, is a book of Taoist religious ritual and liturgy to control and exorcise evil spirits as practiced by the grade four Cheng-i Meng-wei sect (One Auspicious Alliance) priest, Master Chuang.  The author, Professor Michael R. Saso, acted as a \\"participant/observer\\" on Taiwan as he recorded the style of magic from the Ch'ing-wei sect (The Heavenly Pilot, a Tantric Taoist order from the Tang Dynasty), from manuals originally in the collection of Wu Ching-ch'un, and as interpreted and practiced by Master Chuang.    The book TAOIST MASTER CHUANG contained the interesting 4th century Mao shan sect (Highest Purity Order of the Yellow Court Canon) rituals of the Tao of the Left black magic (Chapt. 4) and the Orthodox rituals of the Tao of the Right 'Thunder Magic' (Chapt. 5); and instructions of the use of the 'Lu' which is a register of spirit names.  The Heterodox Tao of the Left black magic emphasized rituals to summon the six evil chia spirits; while the Orthodox Tao of the Right used 'Thunder Magic' to deflect those spirits.  And the ritual of the 'chiao', bringing the priest into direct contact with the Tao itself, was explained to be dependent upon fasting, and a diet of simple foods, whole grains, and vegetables to alter the body's internal alchemy to become receptive to the required ritual.  Also included were the drawn Talismans, finger-formed Mudras, and the chanted Mantras of all Ch'ing-wei sect rituals.    The book TAOIST MASTER CHUANG revealed that esteem and validity amongst Taiwanese Taoist priests seemed to rely on the possession of antique manuals, and that priests were constantly stealing each others books to gain knowledge of the name and descriptions of different spirits and the talismic charms and mantric incantations to control them; plus how to learn to perform various funeral and birth rituals.  It appeared that being a Taoist priest in Taiwan was no different than any other vocation and individuals fell on Taoism as a means of making a living.    The subject of the book, Master Chuang Teng-yun (Chuang who ascends the Clouds) despite his alcoholism and bad temper, was a first rate expert on Meng-wei orthodox Taoism and a conscientious adherent to all the proper liturgy and rites of Ch'ing-wei Thunder Magic.  Master Chuang was also one of the few advanced ordained Taoist priests on Taiwan who knew how to perform the rituals properly.  Such as the dance of the Ho-T'U at the end of the Chiao festival which would bring the priest in direct contact with the Tao itself! Or the proper interpretation of the eight trigrams of King Wen; the Lo-shu (the octagon design you see on placemats at Chinese restaraunts).    Regardless of any scholastic short-comings, the book TAOIST MASTER CHUANG is an important work for the lay student of escoteric religious Taoism, contained a great depth of information which will require several readings, and should be read in conjunction with 'SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS: A Folk Novel of China'(c.1990) by Eva Wong	2004-10-13

Containing common sense advice on preventive medicine plus some very dubious diagnosis, the book: NATURAL HEALING THROUGH MACROBIOTICS (c. 1978) by Michio Kushi, is actually a very good introduction to the concept of the macrobiotic dietary approach to health emphasizing a diet of whole grains and boiled vegetables as staple foods, merged with the Taoist practice of internal alchemy to achieve immortality. <br /> <br />Offering the focused view that \\"only with the biological reconstruction of humanity on an individual basis through the basic means of daily life and diet, could world peace be established\\" (p. 19) coupled with the questionable belief that \\"Almost every modern degenerative illness, inlcuding cancer, heart-disease, and multiple sclerosis, results from the habitual excessive intake of foods which are either too yang, too yin, or both\\" (p. 29), author Michio Kushi then goes on for several chapters categorizing and identifyinig all the foods, diseases, and internal organs as to their yin or yang properties to apply that biological reconstruction of humanity. <br /> <br />Oversimplistic, or possibly even dangerous, views towards illness permeate this work, such as \\"Polio is a yin condition,  and is caused by the excessive consumption of foods like fruit juice, ice cream and sugar\\" (p. 50) and recommended treatment for serious diseases by either varying the diet according to the principles of yin & yang; the administration of plasters (i.e. \\"For the treatment of pnuemonia use a Carp plaster\\" p. 99); or the application of accupunction.  The book also suggested the technique of adjusting the body's pH level by consuming various foods measured by their yin & yang value, which conforms to the practice of internal alchemy by practicing Taoists. <br /> <br />The major value of NATURAL HEALING THROUGH MACROBIOTICS by Michio Kushi, is for the students of Taoist tradition and folklore, rather than for any pragmatic cure for debilitating diseases, mental health, or physical injuries.  To help further understand the basis and reasoning of NATURAL HEALING THROUGH MACROBIOTICS, please read: A TAOIST COOKBOOK (c. 1994) by Michael R. Saso; and SEVEN TAOIST MASTERS (c. 1990) by Eva Wong, to help put macrobiotics and Taoist alchemy and diet into historical perspective.	2004-10-12

RUSSIAN JUDO is a good 92 page paperback booklet containing excellent photos of hybrid Judo/Sambo technique, a historical and interesting account of the author's initial Judo training under the former Soviet bloc system, plus Sambo methodology and why they were incorporated into international Judo competition.  Wonderful step-by-step instructions in black & white photography clearly demonstrated Sambo's over-emphasis on juji-gatame in Judo newaza, and Sambo's obfuscation of kumi-kata which overtly contributed to the IJF prohibition of &#34;unorthodox grips&#34;.  It appeared in the booklet RUSSIAN JUDO that the Sambo/Judo approach to kumi-kata is nothing more than simply entangling your opponent's arms then moving in to throw at the awkward moment.  RUSSIAN JUDO is a must booklet for the  Judo practitioner to own in order to  become aware of Judo's excellent 'Sumi Gaeshi' counter against the Sambo intrusion of the 'belt grip' (page 9); the  leglock (pg. 68); the Sambo version of Judo's Ura Nage called 'brosok cherez drudye' - the chest throw (p. ix),or the many other unorthodox procedures the former Soviet Judo players used against Dr. Kano's 'Classical Judo'.  Clearly  the booklet; RUSSIAN JUDO, demonstrated how clumsy Russian Sambo tactics were merely an act of desperation against the technically proficient Japanese Judoka; and that the basic Sambo counter-attacks were the only former Soviet way of acquiring a few low scoring 'koka' victories against classical Japanese Judo.  The good soft-cover booklet RUSSIAN JUDO also contained photographs of Sato sensei using Tai-Otoshi (body drop) to win a 1970s Sambo match in Riga, which impressed the host Sambo Club; photographs of Sambo/Judo techniques used in international competition; and a very interesting overall history of Russian wrestling, Judo, Sambo, and the author's own Judo training and international competition experiences under the former Soviet Union.  As an informative comparison to RUSSIAN JUDO, please read: FIGHTING JUDO by Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki, and VITAL JUDO by Isano Okano, to compare classic Kodokan Judo with the overt Sambo influence found in RUSSIAN JUDO.	2004-10-02

This seminal work: FIGHTING JUDO (c. 1985) by Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki, the 1981 World Judo Champion, is a useful work in many ways - not only did it present sixty-four excellent black & white photographs of sophisticated entries into Ne-waza, but also contained insight into the life-long training of an elite Japanese Judo champion while sharing some of his profound Judo philosophy.    In some ways, the author's memoirs contained in FIGHTING JUDO are just as instructive as the Newaza photographs, as Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki related that \\"If you have no natural talent you can progress with Ne-waza and progress in Ne-waza is more reliable\\" (p. 10) and how the Japanese sensei's believed \\"It is absolutely crucial to have a firm foundation in the basics before moving on to more advanced techniques\\" (p.10) In this way the Japanese distinguished the 'strong' Judoka from the 'champion' (p. 142).    While merely doing routine Judo randori in Japan, the author noted \\"When I was a high school boy, I broke my right elbow twice and my left elbow once, as well as various fingers and toes ...\\" (p. 141) and how he was ashamed that he only took second place in the All Japan High School Judo Championships.  As an adult, after winning the 1981 World Championships in Maastricht Holland, Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki was bedridden partially paralyzed with an injured neck, another elbow injury, and massive headaches.  Yet instead of retiring from Judo, he took a step-down and avoided entering the All Japan Judo Championships for a sixth time to compete in the international Kano Cup.  Sporting old and fresh injuries equivalent to those received in a car crash, Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki took the gold medal in an international event that few American Judo players are even good enough to enter!  A picture of the author's right hand is shown on page 74 exhibiting the swollen and disfigured fingers from the result of a life-time of Judo.    The powerful work, FIGHTING JUDO, contained photographs of exotic Ne-waza entries used by the author: the \\"Jumping kansetsu-waza [flying juji-gatame](p. 36-37); a one-armed tomoe-nage (p. 56-57); the Susu-jime (p. 76); Kami-jime (p. 77); Koshi-jime (p. 78); and Ashi-sangaku-garami (p.82) just to name a few of the 'tricks'.  The author won ninety percent of his championships with Ne-waza.    The book FIGHTING JUDO would be useful in a college philosophy course as well as in any Judo training center. But this is no hagiography as the self-effacing World Champion Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki reflected: \\"I was the world champion for a minute; at the most for a day. So when you win a championship, enjoy it for one day, feel that you are a champion for one day. But no more\\" (p. 18).     As another example of innovative Ne-waza, please read FIGHTING JUDO along with VITAL JUDO (c.1973) by Isao Okano, BEST JUDO (c.1979) by Isao Inokuma, or 'OLYMPIC JUDO: Groundwork Techniques' (c.1986) by Neil Adams, and if used as a work of anecdotal philosophy, please read FIGHTING JUDO in conjunction with WANDERER (c. 1964, 1998) by Sterling Hayden.	2004-09-28

The manual: 'THE COMPLETE KANO JIU-JITSU [Judo]' (c. 1906, 1961) by Harry Irving Hancock and Katsukuma Higashi, may surprise those who have not seen photographs of combat Judo at its inception.  Filled with 1906 photographs of Judo \\"tricks\\", THE COMPLETE KANO JIU-JITSU displayed a Judo which would not be recognized in today's dojo.<br /><br />This style of 1906 combat Judo portrayed in THE COMPLETE KANO JIU-JITSU was practiced with the standard white Uwa-gi Judo top but with black leggings with leather knee-pads, and while wearing black shoes.  The techniques or \\"tricks\\", as the author described them, resembled free-style wrestling with take downs and few throws.<br /><br />Also, clearly recognizable are the strangle holds and pinning techniques of Tenshin Shinyo Ryu (School of the Natural Way) Jiu-Jitsu and the throwing techniques of Kito Ryu (To Rise and Fall) Jiu-Jitsu; the two styles of Jiu-Jitsu from which the genius Dr. Jigoro Kano developed his Judo.  But some have noted that these techniques may be more representative of Tsutsumi Hozan Ryu jiu-jitsu, as practiced by Katsukuma Higashi.<br /><br />The book THE COMPLETE KANO JIU-JITSU contained the 1906 photographs of two Judo leg-locks (photos No.424 & No.425), and an early Judo leg throw (No. 419), a kick to the groin from standing (No. 416) and from the ground (No. 417).<br /><br />Overall, THE COMPLETE KANO JIU-JITSU is a superb reference source for the hopologist who wishes to delve into the martial arts past and on Judo history.

Containing risible imagery and erroneous demographics, the screed: 'THIS THING CALLED COURAGE: South Boston Stories' (c. 2002) by J.G. Hayes, contained a generic homosexual formula which could be applied to any blue collar neighborhood in the United States, and is nothing specific to South Boston.  In fact, THIS THING CALLED COURAGE entailed no significant insights into South Boston, Massachusetts at all, and failed to render an accurate portrayal of growing up in Southie whether homosexual or heterosexual!<br />Among the many glaring errors is the author's description of the \\"Gate of Heaven Cemetery\\" (p. 2) which has never existed in South Boston.  Or the non-existant haircut, the \\"Regular Boy's Flattop\\" (p. 6) erroneously combining two styles into one (the 'Flattop' went out of style in the 1950s, and the 'Regular Boy's Haircut' is still being taught in Boston area barber schools).  <br />There are more amusing blunders to be found in THIS THING CALLED COURAGE as J.G. Hayes attempted to sound authentic by name-dropping (non)Southie locations such as: \\"Taft Street\\" (p. 28), which is in Dorchester; or \\"Sherman Street\\" (p. 120), which is in Roxbury; or \\"the corner of L and West Broadway [sic]\\" (p. 115) which do not intersect; or the vacuous claim: \\"We cleared out that Westside barroom ...\\" (p. 132), which is inane because there has never been a 'Westside' in South Boston!<br />To the life-long South Boston resident, THIS THING CALLED COURAGE, has no recognizable Southie jargon, argot, slang, or neighborhood locations; and after reading this preposterous econium, I was left with the distinct impression that the author had never stepped foot in Southie in his life. Further, the author's stylistic eccentricities detract significantly from his work, as each chapter's obvious purpose is to lead into some kind of sordid encounter not necessarily related to South Boston.  And frankly, reading about full grown men having sex with each other, or with underaged teenage boys, or committing suicide is revolting - and only emphasized the misanthropic nature of homosexuality.<br />The phillipic, 'THIS THING CALLED COURAGE: South Boston Stories' by J. G. Hayes, attempted to sustain a homosexual fantasy at the expense of a traditional-family Boston neighborhood in absence of any symbolism, allegory, or credible demographics; and lacked the support of strong character development in a ridiculous attempt to take the reader on a sympathetic journey through any of the character's experiences.	2004-06-19

Highly anecdotal and unreferenced, the memoir: 'ALL SOULS: A Family Story from Southie' (c. 2000) by Mr. Michael Patrick MacDonald, simultaneously presented an unquestionable account of the author's tragic family life while presenting a dubious description of the neighborhood of South Boston.<br />Any life-long resident of South Boston who reads ALL SOULS will recognize the many errors in this memoir and the author's reliance on hyperbole for dramatic effect; such as referring to a fist fight as a 'riot' or an orderly protest as a 'mob'. The author further uses terminology not part of South Boston vocabulary, such as: Racist, Scapegoat, riots, molotov cocktails, and 'Lace Curtain Irish' (which is straight out of the book: 'Liberty's Chosen Home' p. 30 and not a Boston figure of speech).<br /> ALL SOULS is further marred by the many suppositions, innuendos, and non-sequiturs used to describe residents and the neighborhood: such as the author's detailed descriptions of Whitey Bulger, a man the author admitted he never met; or the mentioning throughout ALL SOULS of the bar, the *Irish Rover*, which isn't even in South Boston but three miles away in Dorchester.  In fact, the author seemed to have had most of his Southie experiences on the South Boston/Dorchester border, blurring those two distinct neighborhoods.<br />While the careful reader will not question the authenticity of the author's account of his family tragedies, some of which appear self-inflicted, the MacDonald family, as presented in ALL SOULS, had serious issues way before they moved to the Old Colony projects - therefore, 'ipse dixit', those tragedies 'happened' in South Boston, they were not 'caused' by South Boston, as implied in ALL SOULS!  For the vast majority of South Boston's diverse &amp; multi-cultural 32,000 residents, except for forced busing, Southie was a good place to grow up!<br />Neither autobiography nor diary, the memoir ALL SOULS is obviously valueless for serious historical research.The author mistook digressions for correlations, as Mr. Michael Patrick MacDonald presented a heart rendering account of his family's tragedies along with a dubious and mechanistic opinion of South Boston history and events.

Already recognized since 1949 as \\"a masterpiece in scholarship\\" in its field by several eminent architects, the 173 page tome: ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES IN THE AGE OF HUMANISM, 4th ed. (1971) by Rudolf Wittkower; had, incidentally, also provided an in-depth explanation on proportion and ratio as they differed in usage between architectural procedure and Boethian mathematics.  <BR>Of special importance is part four 'The Problem of Harmonic Proportion in Architecture' (p. 101) where the author made the salient point that \\"Although the Pythagoreo-Platonic concept of the numerical ratios of the musical scale never disappeared from mediaeval [sic], theological, philosophical, and aesthetic thought, there was no over-riding need to apply them to art and architecture\\" (p. 159).<br />Rudolf Wittkower unknowingly provided in part four the distinction between an elite Quadrivium education containing Boethian \\"mathematical arts\\" while \\"the 'liberal arts' of painting, sculpture, and architecture were regarded as manual occupations\\" (p. 117). The author explained \\"That the high Renaissance architects shunned theory\\" and \\"that they were practitioners rather than thinkers\\" (p. 30).  And further \\"Italian architects strove for an easily perceptible ratio between length, height, and depth\\" (p. 74).  So then according to this author, all of the Renaissance architects conception of architecture was based on a \\"commensurability of ratios\\" (p. 108).<br />Rudolf Wittkower indicated \\"that the [Renaissance] architect is by no means free to apply to a building a system of ratios of his own choosing, that the ratios have to comply with conceptions of a higher order and that a building should mirror the proportions of the human body\\" (p. 101).  In developing the centrally planned church, Renaissance architects faced the dilemma of the pragmatics of church construction combined with the belief in divinity and the acceptance of Roman Catholic dogma.  <br />The Church was to provide the \\"easily perceptible ratio\\" with the simple logic that \\"As man is the image of God and the proportions of his body are produced by divine will, so the proportions in architecture have to embrace and express the cosmic order\\" (p. 101).  That cosmic order and harmony are contained in certain numbers Plato explained in his TIMAEUS.<br />Assigned to the architects, a Quadrivium trained Roman Catholic friar and musical theorist, Franchino Gaffurio (1451-1522) \\"in a truly Platonic spirit he regarded this principle of harmony as the basis of macrocosm and microcosm, body and soul, painting, architecture, and medicine\\" (p. 124).  It was under this famous Renaissance musical theorist in 1525 that \\"the old belief in the mysterious efficacy of certain numbers and ratios was given new impetus\\" (p. 102).  \\"It was Pythagoras who discovered that tones can be measured in space.  What he found was that musical consonances were determined by the ratios of small whole numbers.  If two strings are made to vibrate under the same conditions, one being half the length of the other, the pitch of the shorter string will be one octave (diapason) above that of the larger one\\" (p. 102).  \\"Thus the consonances, on which the Greek musical system was based - octave, fifth, and fourth - can be expressed by the progression 1:2:3:4.  One can understand that this staggering discovery made people believe that they had seized upon the mysterious harmony which pervades the universe\\" (p. 103).<br />\\"The musical consonances are determined by the mean proportionals; for that the three means constitute all the intervals of the musical scale had been shown in the TIMAEUS.  Classical writers on musical theory discussed this point at great length.  An exhaustive exposition is to be found in Boethius' DE MUSICA, first printed in Venice in 1491-92, and of very great importance for the doctrine of numbers throughout the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance\\" (p. 111).<br />Yet Boethius's DE MUSICA was de-emphasized by Renaissance architects in recognition that the \\"harmony of the universe which Plato had described in the TIMAEUS on the basis of Pythagora's discovery of the ratios of musical consonances\\" prompted the \\"application of Pythagoreo-Platonic system of harmonic ratios directly to architecture\\" (p. 125).  As it turned out (not surprisingly) \\"Gafurio [sic] was regarded by his contemporaries as a critic in architectural matters\\" (p. 125).<br />The author of ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES IN THE AGE OF HUMANISM provided the evidence that although the Quadrivium of the mathematical arts of music, astronomy, geometry, and Boethian proportion and ratio, was known to the Renaissance high architects, they preferred the 'harmonic proportion'; 'proportion of excess'; and the 'proportio proportionum'; derived directly from Plato's TIMAEUS and Pythagoras's three means (arithmetic, geometric, and the harmonic) over Boethius's DE MUSICA, though it was a substantial part of friar Gaffurio's ecclesiastical education.  This resulted in \\"proportionally integrated 'spatial mathematics', which we have recognized as a distinguishing feature of humanist Renaissance architecture\\" (p. 26).<br />In comparison, for the practical application of Boethian proportion and ratios, please read: THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME (2001) by Dr. Ann E. Moyer, where the rules of Boethian proportion found in rithmomachia, had been clearly defined, though inadvertently, by Rudolf Wittkower.	2004-03-10

Moyer [with an edition of Ralph Lever and William Fulke, 'The Most Noble, Auncient, and Learned Playe (1563)] \\"is at times as much about the history and significance of the teaching of Boethius's ARITHMETIC as it is about the game itself.\\" (p. 13)<br />Indeed, the book appeared to be mis-titled as the author seemed to digress away from Rithmomachia and onto Medieval and Renaissance European reaction to Boethian mathematics via the Philosopher's Game.<br />Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (d. 524 A.D.) whose two major texts, the ARITHMETIC (a loose translation of writings by the second century scholar Nicomachus of Gerosa); and the DE MUSICA (which was heavily based on the \\"Pythagoreo-Platonic concept of numerical ratios of the musical scale\\"); were the main text sources for the Quadrivium, the curriculum of monastic schools, cathedral schools, and somewhat in the newly formed universities (studia generalia).  It is Dr. Moyer's contention that \\"rithmomachia had arisen with the promotion of the quadrivium in 11th century-education, so the game's disappearance helps mark the end of this long era of European learning and culture\\". (p. 123)<br />Yet a few problems of consistency arose within THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME which impaired her thesis; as Dr. Moyer stated in her proem that \\"Rithmomachia was played as long as Boethius's ARITHMETIC was taught; the game and the curriculum disappeared together\\" (p. 13) which contrasted sharply with her observation of Renaissance Italy where \\"Boethius's ARITHMETIC did not hold there the place it had held traditionally in northern Europe ... Boethian influence remained as only one aspect among many of mathematics and related studies.\\" (p. 123)<br />The Renaissance Italians, first exposed to Rithmomachia in Florence \\"in the social gatherings at the Racellai gardens\\" (p. 115), were entirely ignorant of Boethian proportions and his text, the ARITHMETIC; and felt \\"the key to correct proportion is Pythagora's system of musical harmony.\\"  (Wittkower, 'Architectural Principles' p. 33).  Rithmomachia was played in Italy (and England) as the 'Pythagora's Game', and Francesco Barrozi (c. 1560), modified the rules by Boissiere by totally eliminating Boethian proportion to expedite the beginner to the game.  Obviously, in contrast to the author's assertion that the game was played as long as the ARITHMETIC was taught, it is apparent that Rithmomachia was sometimes played in total ignorance of the ARITHMETIC, or independently of Boethian mathematics, and well beyond the life of the Quadrivium curricula.<br />Depending heavily on a secondary source, Arno Borst, to claim that Rithmomachia, the 'battle of numbers' was invented  c. 1030 in a German monastic school by a monk named Asilo, who \\"made use of Gerbert's SCHOLION on Boethius's ARITHMETIC in comprising his rithmomachia\\" (p. 20), Dr. Moyer made no effort to document another possible inventor, Herman Contractus, simply understating his contribution.  With Dr. Moyer's emphasis of the interest also taken in chess, she took no consideration of the indigenous games of Northern Europe and their possible influence on Rithmomachia.  For example, the Viking game 'Halatafl' (fox & geese) dating back to before 400 A.D. and played until the 17th century, where the geese are to capture the fox by surrounding him on all sides so it cannot move, is 'a fortiori' reminiscent of 'Ambuscade' found in the Philosopher's Game!<br />Therefore the book THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME is not a definitive work, and contained a number of non-sequiturs, unreferenced claims, foot-noted digressions,  'cum hoc' fallacies, a resort to determinism, and internal inconsistencies.  Despite the large number of useful sources, the author would have made her work more rigorous if she included in her bibliograhy translated copies of her secondary sources along with William Fulke's manual. <br />A work which should be read in conjunction with Professor Ann Moyer is: ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES IN THE AGE OF HUMANISM (1962, 1971) by Rudolf Wittkower, where in chapter four is found a scholarly in-depth treatise of Renaissance Italy's dependence on Plato's 'Timaeus'; Pythagorean number theory; and Plato's musical scales, for the practical application of Renaissance architectural ratio and proportion, without Boethius's ARITHMETIC; while, unintentionally, providing clear and precise explanations of the ratio formulas and proportions found in the rules of Rithmomachia.   <br />This good work: THE PHILOSOPHER'S GAME by Dr. Ann Moyer, is useful to anyone studying the historical influence which the Boethian text, ARITHMETIC, had on a Quadrivium education; but (at $65.00 and 205 pages) might disappoint the serious player of Rithmomachia.	2004-03-04

Blending little known writers with political polemicists & ecclesiastical dissidents, then referring to them as 'philosophers'; the book: PHILOSOPHY FOR BEGINNERS (1993) by Richard Osborne, et al; is a collection of obvious biases, obfuscations, and prejudicial views in an easy-to-read comic book format; which will obscure philosophy from mere opinion to the beginner.<br />Examples of the author's selected preferences runs throughout his work - one example is a short biography of communist agitator Rosa Luxembourg appearing on page 162, in absence of any commentary about Ayn Rand (but then neither are philosophers). Or the term 'libertarian' having been identified as meaning \\"right-winged\\", but the communist euphemism of 'progressive' is not to be found.  Also the economist Karl Marx was referred to as a 'philosopher', but no comment is found on the genius J.P. Morgan!<br />It isn't just that a defunct theory such as Marxism is being preferred over economic rationality such as capitalism; or a dissident like Platonist Duns Scotus Eriugena being preferred over accepted Aristotelian St. Thomas Aquinas; it is just this author had obviously emphasized any mechanistic, deterministic, or behavioristic view over any ideological, existential, or teleological system, without adequate explanation for the beginner to comprehend the difference - the result then is sheer indoctrination.  <br />To the author's credit, he stated on page 149 that the \\"Characteristic of the school (i.e. Analytic Philosophy) is the desire to clarify, through analysis, and a hostility toward metaphysics.\\"  It is this preference for Analytic Philosophy and a \\"hostility\\" towards metaphysics in any form, without defining the differences, which perverts PHILOSOPHY FOR BEGINNERS (and pervades this entire 'Beginners' series)!<br />The book PHILOSOPHY FOR BEGINNERS has amusing cartoons, a general overview of the history of philosophy, a nice selection of marginalized thinkers, loose usage of the term 'Philosopher', and a selective emphasis of radicals, as the author demonstrated his love of polemic over wisdom!	2004-03-02

The simple 107 page expose': THE MARTIN LUTHER KING, jr., PLAGIARISM STORY (1994) by Theodore Pappas, is an excellent work which showed how far left-wing fascism and liberal intolerance pervades the American academic community (except when it comes to expousing their own agenda).  The author clearly showed how the ex-Dr. Martin Luther King plagiarized throughout his career, as an undergraduate at MoreHouse College and as a graduate at B.U.; and the machinations to which the political left have practiced to minimize the intellectual theft of this dishonorable man.<br />Martin Luther King's dissertation was entitled: 'A Comparison of the Conception of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman' BU 1955.  The King Papers Project discovered the plagiarism in his dissertation in late 1987, yet sat on the discovery for a number of years until a British newspaper broke the story.  King copied directly from a former B.U. doctoral student - Jack Boozer.<br />To Theodore Pappa's credit, he further identified that King's 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail'; the 'I Have A Dream Speech'; and his Nobel Prize lecture, also \\"contained significant portions taken from other sources.\\"<br />Yet a liberal committee investigating the plagiarism determined in a September 1991 report \\"because King plagiarized only 45 percent of the first half of his dissertation and only 21 percent of the second, the thesis remains a legitimate and 'intelligent contribution to scholarship' about which 'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree'\\"(p.103).  The tortured reasoning is all too obvious.  But the question is Why?<br />To Theodore Pappas's discredit, he did not delve on Martin Luther King's adultery, his preference for white prostitutes, his close association with members of the American Communist Party, or his long history as a scofflaw, e.g. Martin Luther was not his legal name, it was Michael! Mike King continued his scofflaw career as a willing dupe for the political left, as he broke laws down South, ended up in Birmingham jail for his crimes, and encouraged others to do the same.  Even the late, great Louise Day Hicks of South Boston told Martin Luther King that he was no representative of the American Negro!<br />But in defense of Mike King, his wanton misappropriation of another man's work could have stemmed from homosexuality and other \\"human failings\\" throughout his career, which would make him irrational rather than criminal. And its only fair to Mike King that most of his speeches were written for him by his left-wing entourage. Though Mike King was never a member of the Communist Party, he cooperated with them fully as a willing dupe for the division of America along racial lines (read the Verona decrypts!).<br />A second, 'revised', weaker edition of Theodore Pappas's work has appeared: PLAGIARISM AND THE CULTURE WAR: The Writings of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Other Prominent Americans (1998), which should be read for comparison, as it attempts to minimize the Mike King scandal by submerging King's blatant theft by insinuating the false notion that paraphrasing, ghost writing, and pen names (nom de plume) of other well known Americans is a form of plagiarism.<br />The work: THE MARTIN LUTHER KING PLAGIARISM STORY, should be required reading in every class on American history, English literature, formal writing, and Philosophy on ethics.for the political left, as he broke laws down South, ended up in Birmingham jail for his crimes, and encouraged others to do the same.

Written by a South Boston expatriate [who hasn't lived in South Boston for decades], the book: 'SOUTH BOSTON: My Home Town - The History of an Ethnic Neighborhood' (c. 1988, 1994) by B.C. history professor Thomas H. O'Connor, ignored the usual tenets of logic and historiography and took a contingent and non-teleological world view of the history of his ex-neighborhood, South Boston.<br /><br />Containing all the usual ingredients of determinism - such as: truisms (e.g. \\"The Dorchester Heights monument was completed in 1901 ...\\" p. 107) interpreted with many unreferenced categorical statements (e.g. \\" 'Most' of the Irish who came to America ...\\" p 78, and \\"In 'most' South Boston Schools ...\\" p. 121, or \\" ... the anti-semitism among 'some' Irish Catholics ...\\" p. 186); Professor O'Connor, in an attempt to initiate a self-fulfilling prophecy, simply collected a series of stereotypes which coincided with the media coverage of the anti-forced busing events of 1974-1984 Boston, of which he personally was not involved!<br /><br />This blatant manipulation of information is further enhanced by these curiously irresponsible statements that \\"To a great extent, Irish emigrants brought their traditional drinking habits with them when they came to America.\\" (p. 44) and \\" ... the potato was the absolute mainstay of the Irish diet.\\" (p. 47). In light of the facts that the first beer pump in Boston is found in South Boston at the German bar \\"Amrheims\\"; and in Ireland, the Irish don't just eat potatoes!<br /><br />As a further case in reader manipulation, the book 'SOUTH BOSTON: My Home Town' contained an anachronism as Prof. O'Connor perpetuated a crude specimen of Boston 'Mytho-history'.  On page 254 in Prof. O'Connor's sources is found the screed LIBERTY'S CHOSEN HOME (c.1977) where journalist Alan Lupo related the excited outburst of an anti-forced busing protester in 1974 to then Mayor Kevin White that: \\"No matter how poor we were, Kevin, we always had clean lace curtains on our windows\\"(p. 30).  And through sheer hyperbole, this exclamation from a non-Irish women found its way into 'SOUTH BOSTON: My Home Town' (p. 87) as the 1901 long established tradition of \\"the lace curtain Irish\\"!  It is undocumented that there has ever been a lace curtain Irish in Boston and this description is specious.<br /><br />The book 'SOUTH BOSTON: My Home Town' presented a series of inconsistencies and mechanistically biased views of the author's former hometown:  Prof. O'Connor emphasized white racism and ignored all the black racism found in Boston (p. 219); constantly referred to South Boston as an 'ethnic' neighborhood, but didn't describe at EXACTLY what point South Boston became a 'white' neighborhood when it came to his description of forced busing (p. 209); the author mentioned historical 'forces' throughout his work with no explanation of exactly what those mysterious 'forces' were? (e.g. pgs. 115 & 246); and in confusing digressions for correlations, Prof. O'Connor committed the 'post hoc' fallacy by constantly comparing two disassociate events: the Irish immigrants in the 1854 North End (Boston) as a \\"theme\\" (p. 32) for the behaviour of the Irish American minority in 1974 South Boston, two miles away and 120 years later! (An illegitimate teleology occurs when an author speculates, without sufficient proof, that x causes y).<br /><br />The omission of relevant data also marred 'SOUTH BOSTON: My Home Town' as Prof. O'Connor listed some of the whimsical nicknames (p. 178) found among South Boston residents but neglected to include his poster boy's, former mayor Ray Flynn, sobriquet of 'Mel' Flynn (and why he earned it).  Also omitted from this work was the fact that the Irish American became a vocal minority by 1974, surpassed in the 1950s by Lithuanian, Polish, Estonian, Latvian, and Albanian immigrants fleeing communist persecution by the former Soviet Union - thereby breaking any contingency between the Irish immigrants of 1854 Boston, and the Irish American of 1974 South Boston! There were also 240 Afro-American families, plus a small colony of Mic Mac Indians from the Canadian Maritimes living in Southie when the Federal judge declared the Boston Schools segregated, which escaped the author's attention.<br /><br />Though this was supposed to be a history of South Boston, the author tended to drag in the history of all the Irish no matter how far or removed from Southie; e.g. Irish immigrants of New York city. (This is where Prof. O'Connor's specialty in demographics tended to displace his knowledge of South Boston history.) Then, inconsistently, Prof. O'Connor failed to mention the most segregated and insulated neighborhood in Boston's entire history - Chinatown!<br /><br />Professor O'Connor's collection of generalizations, unsubstantiated allegations, and unreferenced claims, makes it impossible for the researcher to verify his information.

Essentially written by a quisling, the screed; 'SCHOOLS ON TRIAL: An Inside Account of the Boston Desegregation Case' (c. 1981) by sociologist Robert A. Dentler, et. al.; supposedly presented an intimate view of the planning process which put a federal judge's controversial 1974 court order to desegregate the Boston Public Schools into practice, yet surprisingly offered very little insight into the planning stages which did not draw from the general books published on the subject; or the findings of nebulous research institutes; or vague newspaper accounts, which the author listed in scanty notes at the end of each chapter.<br />Demonstrating a clumsily articulated defense of the ruling, the book, SCHOOLS ON TRIAL, was often punctuated by meglomaniac rants (e.g. \\"When a federal court concluded that local or state school officials have engaged in illegal discriminatory actions, it must order an immediate remedy for the wrong.\\" p. 13) and totalitarian tirades (e.g. \\"...free choice and open enrollment options are rejected.\\" p. 13). And throughout the book, the author, like the judge, displayed an egotistical contempt for the democratic traditions of free choice, self-government, self-rule, and the separation of powers.<br />Flawed in his reasoning, Dr. Dentler shifted from pertinent questions regarding forced desegregation (e.g. \\"Who will learn more?\\" p. 19) to inchoate ramblings (e.g. \\"Its [forced busing] social importance is clear, but its real bearing on learning is obscure except for the importance to the advantaged of relying upon what is already known.\\" p. 19) ???<br />Also absurdly incongruous, Dr. Robert Dentler Phd stated: \\"The Boston case was never about busing. Busing, like the neighborhood school, was an invention of antidesegregationists\\" (p. 27) followed by \\"We learned quickly that busing of public school children in Boston was desirable, feasible, and necessary to achieve desegregation\\" (p. 29) which flew in the face of the reality of the protests and counter-suits in 1974 Boston! Please read these solecisms again, and remember that this author was the 'expert' appointed by the offending judge as the primary architect of forced busing which resulted in massive white flight; forced collectivization; the stabbing of two white students; and the academic ruination of the Boston Public Schools, and one might gather an insight as to the socialist agenda of the judge himself.<br />But like a good little toady, the author of SCHOOLS ON TRIAL blamed the victims of forced busing in an attempt to excoriate his master from responsibility of his destructive 1974 decision by this, 'a post priori' 1981 observation that \\"Most of the serious flaws in the court plan that have materialized in a five year period of implementation can be traced back to insufficient and incorrect information\\" (p. 48); to which the author listed all the \\"incorrect information\\", [which influenced the judge's decision], on pages 25 thru 27.<br />Incompetent even as a sycophant, Dr. Robert Dentler unintentionally pointed out that \\"No one had shown during the liability hearings that every school in the system was segregated\\" (p. 40) and how Garrity admitted himself in 'Morgan v. Hennigan' that \\"How many students were intentionally separated on a racial basis cannot be stated with any degree of precision, ...\\" (p. 6). This author showed, in 'ignoratio elenchi' that \\"incorrect information\\" coupled with reasonable doubt were what the federal judge based his court decision that Boston's schools were segregated. Then in 'capro expiatori' scapegoated jurisprudence itself by stating \\"We believe that a court and attorneys for plaintiff are, in this regard, victims of structural constraint\\" (p. 47).<br />As a jumble of dim platitudes, the book: SCHOOLS ON TRIAL, must be eligible for some sort of prize in its fatuity, for it is not a history of the planning of forced busing in Boston, but a poorly written and tortured rationalization for the erroneous decision made bythe federal judge, by one of his own court appointed stooges.	2003-07-11

Stressing a contingent and interconnected historical process while clogged with Marxist rhetoric and apologetic to judicial decree; the mechanistic study: 'DESEGREGATION IN BOSTON AND BUFFALO: The Influence of Local Leaders' (c. 1998) by political science professor Steven J. L. Taylor, ostensibly compared the leadership of two disassociate events - court ordered forced busing in Boston and Buffalo.    Bafflingly admitting that \\"Between Boston and Buffalo there are differences in geographic location, economic structure, size, and neighborhood identification\\" (p. 9) then insisted that in order to form the basis of a study \\"There must be some geographical propinquity between the two locales\\" (p. 201), the author ignored the 500 mile distance between Boston and Buffalo yet continued with his logical inconcatenance. Professor Taylor further expounded that \\"Few American cities could have been different from one another as Boston of 1974 was from Boston of one century earlier\\" (p. 13) without explaining how Boston and Buffalo could correspond under such circumstances.    Methodologically, as well as internally, inconsistent; DESEGREGATION IN BOSTON AND BUFFALO, contained over 104 books and 45 magazine & journal articles in its bibliography, but Professor Taylor saw fit to cite less than 35 throughout his text. Of the tens of thousands of anti-forced busing protesters in 1974 Boston, this researcher interviewed the statistically insignificant amount of three (3), relying instead on anecdotal information, and dogmatic assertions supported by non-sequiturs to bolster his thesis.    One of the dozens of examples of contradictions scattered throughout DESEGREGATION IN BOSTON AND BUFFALO was the author's claim that \\"One would also be hard pressed to label Judge W. Garrity as a stranger to Boston\\" strangely followed by the observation that \\"Garrity was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, just 45 miles east of Boston.\\" Federal Judge Arthur Garrity was born in Worcester, went to college in Cambridge, and settled in Wellesley - the man was never from Boston, and this little factoid seems to have escaped Professor Taylor's selective research.    Omission of relevant data also marred this work as Professor Taylor ignored the 240 Afro-American families living in South Boston in the summer of 1974 (and some were enthusiastic rock throwers at buses!); as well as the small colony of Mic Mac Indians from the Canadian Maritimes; coupled with the fact that the Irish American was a vocal minority in South Boston, outnumbered since 1950 by the Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, Polish, and Albanians fleeing communist persecution from the former Soviet Union (and whom the racists would label as 'white'). Today, South Boston High School is 95% Afro-American & hispanic in a 90% caucasian neighborhood; South Boston High had been declared officially 'dysfunctional' by the Massachusetts Board of Education; Boston's population has dropped from 620,000 to 580,000 due to white flight; and what was once an adequate school system has been reduced to an academic wasteland directly thanks to an insipid court order - which costs Boston taxpayers $55 million a year to implement!    Further weak in his research and vague in his conclusions regarding court-ordered forced busing, Professor Taylor surmised that \\"One of the major lessons is the futility of trying to seek the reversal of a decision when the violations are blatant\\" (p. 215) in obvious oblivion to the judge's own advice that \\"The only routes available are a judicial appeal or a constitutional amendment.\\" [Boston Evening Globe Oct. 10, 1974 p. 1] which was what Boston's elected representatives where attempting in the first place!    In his devotion to determinism, the author implied a 'causal necessity' by stating on page 167 that \\"Historical factors motivated Boston's leaders to behave in the manner they did when faced with the desegregation order\\" but neglected to explain exactly what those mysterious \\"Historical Factors\\" were! Rather than treating intelligent residents as implements in an abstraction called history, Professor Taylor would have been more scholarly if he attempted to explain Boston's politicians behavior due to the recognition of the Federal Judge's egregious violation of the Separation of Powers Act with the busing decree, and of elected officials operating within their training under the tenets of the democratic process.    Geographically and demographically challenged, as well as tendentiously written, illogical, unsupported by evidence, and useless as a scholarly text, DESEGREGATION IN BOSTON AND BUFFALO presented a slanted story which was well below the standards of research for someone in the author's occupation. With his aspiration that \\"This thesis has implications beyond academia, it is also relevant for practioners in public policy\\" (p. 215) Professor Taylor revealed his study to be a mere political pamphlet written by an ideologue.	2003-06-28
US	37169651	RZ48O5D1DXFN0	0486242439	480285695	The Book Before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental (Lettering, Calligraphy, Typography)	Books	4	27	29	N	N	An Exceedingly Convenient Reference!	The chief value of this work is in its collection of photographs of rare and unique manuscripts and its mass of empirical data; therefore this effort of Dr. David Diringer - 'THE BOOK BEFORE PRINTING: Ancient, Medieval, and Oriental (c.1953, 1982), becomes a nice compendium of evidence rather than a plausible theory of the development of the modern book.<br />Indeed this author's use of the word 'book' to designate any written material is a source of ambiguity as Dr. Diringer further refined his definition of a book to only the written word found \\"on perishible material such as wood, leather, or papyrus\\" (p. 48). So according to this author, only the written word found on clay, rolls, scrolls, leather parchments, linen, and waxed boards up to and including the codex are books - but not stone tablets, cave etchings, monument markings or metal stampings.<br />Though other studies begin their histories of the book with the codex (e.g. THE CODEX by Dr. Roberts; and THE BIRTH OF THE CODEX by C. H. Roberts), this author's extension of his book definition back to the furthest reaches of human civilization had inadvertently provided the reader with such a broad survey of data that few students will not be instructed by the many well chosen photographs of the rare and ancient manuscripts the author collected to use as examples of books.<br />In fact, the sheer volume of the photocopied documents almost compelled a reader to turn another page. In chronological order, each photocopy of a scroll, parchment, or codex coincided with Dr. Diringer's explanation of a period in a country's ancient history in which that document was produced. (This is a point where the author's expertise in writing tended to displace his main theme of  book history). Yet some documents have achieved such a mythical quality, as 'Beowulf' or the 'Iliad' that it is striking to see a clear, legible photocopy on a following page.<br />Dr. Diringer made his work further interesting by juxtaposing several copies of ancient manuscripts for either penmanship, language, material, or size comparison. This is exceedingly convenient as the author provided a quick reference of distinguishing artifact features; such as: \\"National Hands\\" (p. 286) of 7th century Merovingian with the Visogothic cursive; and the 9th century Roman minuscule with the 10th century Benevendon script. The author provided a clear view of such esoteric documents as: the Lipit-Ishtar Law Code (4,500 B.C.); the Codex Sinaitus (4th century), and the earliest Japanese written document - the 'Shotoku Taishi (573 a.d.). Thus the mere perusal of THE BOOK BEFORE PRINTING will become a learning experience as the bibliophile might discover a rare document containing an alphabet or language (or the existence of a race) new to his studies. The sheer beauty and antiquity of some of these manuscripts, such as 'The Book of Kells', or the 15th century illuminated copy of 'Chaucer', and the clay Summerian tablet of the 'Hammurabi Law Code' written in cuneiform, are magnificent.<br />Originally published as THE HAND PRODUCED BOOK (c. 1953); THE BOOK BEFORE PRINTING is not so much a history of the book as it is many histories of the written word. Containing few mistakes (I found one spelling error on page 75; and the original title is still extant on top of each text page) Dr. Diringer had produced an excellent and valuable reference tool for the general reader as well as the scholar. If you need to choose a subject topic for an English, History, Archaeological, or palaeological dissertation then THE BOOK BEFORE PRINTING might help you in that choice. So even if you don't believe that a scroll is a book, Dr. David Diringer's work is still worth reading.	2003-05-31

Ed by Edmund Hayes (136P)	Books	4	18	18	N	N	An excellent annotation of a valuable primary source.	Basically, a well annotated primary source, the book: 'LOG OF THE UNION: John Boit's Remarkable Voyage to the Northwest Coast and Around the World 1794-1796' (c.1981) edited by Edmund Hayes; is the sloop's log of a two year circumnavigation by a nineteen year old sea captain during the initial stages of the American republic just after the revolutionary war. The UNION was a 65' 5\\", 94 ton topsail sloop with a crew of 22, heavily armed with cannon, and was fitted out in Newport, RI for a two year voyage to the fur trade in the Pacific northwest, then to the tea & porcelan market in Canton China, and a return trip to Boston. The development of the maritime fur trade along the northwest coast was one of many incentives for that coast's early exploration in the late 1790s.  Primarily of interest to the scholar, the LOG OF THE UNION contained no lessons or instruction in ship handling or navigation, but a word-for-word transcription of a fascinating account of a topsail sloop's journey around the globe. The LOG OF THE UNION is of special interest because it documented the first American sloop to sail around the world; and described, in meticulous detail, an extended sea voyage that was undertaken just before then president George Washington signed the naval act of March 1794 which authorized the construction of America's six original frigates (the USS CONSTITUTION; USS CONSTELLATION; USS UNITED STATES; USS CHESAPEAKE; USS CONGRESS; and the USS PRESIDENT).  The age of captain Boit was not particularly noteworthy in an era where the average lifespan was just twenty-four years old; a nineteen year old merchant sea captain would not have been unusual. British subjects became midshipmen in Her Majesty's Navy at age ten, then became lieutenants at age sixteen. Lord Nelson at age twenty-four was a full captain (equivalent to an Army colonel) of a fifth rate frigate.  The LOG OF THE UNION documented the typical sailing strategy employed by 18th century sea captains in capturingall the prevailing winds, seasons, and ocean currents during the age of sail. To get to the Pacific northwest, the sloop UNION left Newport in January 1794; sailed across the Atlantic to the Canary Islands; down the coast of Africa to the Cape Verde Islands, then crossed the Atlantic again; sailed down the South American coast to the Falkland Islands. The sloop UNION made the bumpy passage around Cape Horn and steered north to reach the Pacific northwest and then landed on Vancouver Island. After completing her trading business in 1795, she steered for the Hawaiian Islands from the Vancouver Islands. From Hawaii the UNION sailed to Canton China to sell its furs (150 sea otter; 300 beaver; and other land furs), pick up a consignment of tea and porcelan, and to recondition the ship for the trip to Boston, Massachusetts. She departed Canton for Boston in January 1796, down the China sea; through the Strait of Sunda, past the 18th Parallel; south in the Indian Ocean; then sailed directly west to take advantage of the south east trades and the south equatorial current. Upon leaving Mauritius, she passed south of Madagascar, around the Cape of Good Hope; up the west coast of Africa, until she entered the northeast trades which pushed her across the Atlantic to Boston.  Of special note are all the detailed drawings by artist Hewitt Jackson showing the UNION, stern to, with her sweeps extended, and all of the sail plans and points of sail of captain Boit's ninety four ton topsail sloop. Hewitt Jackson recorded all of the structures and details of the UNION's ground tackle, armament, storage capabilities, long boat, various cross sections of the hull, and of crewman (the 'people') engaged in various duties as briefly described in the captain's log.  Not only do the excellent drawings by Hewitt Jackson enhance the LOG OF THE UNION, but more importantly are the photostatic copies of the actual pages of the log itself. Captain John Boit had a fine 'round' hand and kept an impeccable record of the two year voyage in copperplate penmanship. The traditional 1794 era handwriting itself would make the LOG OF THE UNION a valuable historical artifact let alone its informational content. There are also copies of John Boit's hand drawn charts of the Falkland Islands complete with soundings.  To add to the scholarly interest, the editor, Edmund Hayes, saw fit to explain the 18th century grammar found in the log. Throughout the journal is found captain John Boit's use of the familiar 'ye': e.g. log entry Nov. 2nd 1795: \\"Caulker on ye main-deck.\\", which is actually a contracted form of 'the' and it is pronounced the same. And 'ye' is an ancient runic letter (known as 'thorn') which designated the 'th' sound in English. (Only the Quakers in America have been known to pronounce 'ye' as 'yee'.)  The editor included interesting incidental information in subsequent chapters such as the method of keeping the log at sea (p. 135) or the short comings of the 18th century use of tangential arcs when ship building (p. 129). Similar to other ship journals, the brevity of the UNION log entries is typical of the seagoing profession (where the less said, the better) and captain John Boit's two longest journal entries for the entire voyage are found in photostat on page seventy-one.  After the completion of his successful two year voyage in 1796, John Boit was still a sea captain when he passed away in 1829. The LOG OF THE UNION is a fascinating account of life at sea during the initial inception of the young American republic. The captain of the sloop UNION, who completed the commercially successful two year trip without a single loss of life, is generally regarded by historians to be one of the outstanding sea captians produced by the early republic and his log is mute testimony to that talent.  The LOG OF THE UNION is a brilliant document which should be read by both scholar and practical sailor alike. Its only shortcoming is that the editor, Edmund Hayes, shouldhave included much more photostatic copies of the original sloop's log alongside the transcription for readers to learn and compare from captain John Boit's own handwriting itself.	2003-05-25

Formisano, is a sanctimonius and inconsistent work that provided few insights into the dynamics of Boston's anti-forced busing movement but \\"demonstrated a kind of intellectual onanism to which the author was dedicated\\". Fundamentally, documented truisms coupled with dogmatic assertions seemed to be the author's methodology to promote his pet theory of 'Reactionary Populism'.<br />The American philosopher, W.V. Quine, stated \\"That nearly any statement can be made to fit with the data, so long as one makes the 'requisite compesatory adjustments'\\". And these 'adjustments' can be found throughout BOSTON AGAINST BUSING as: question begging (e.g.,\\"Anyone who reads Garrity's decision in Morgan v. Hennigan will understand why he found the school committee guilty of segregative practices.\\" p.9); truisms (e.g., \\"The Boston Irish did not feel responsible for slavery or the long history of black oppression. They believed that the blacks should raise themselves up as other immigrant groups had done before them.\\" p. 41); palindromes(e.g., \\"Hicks was just as much a creature of the backlash as she was one of its creators.\\" p. 30) and in 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' - confused digressions for correlations (\\"I know that discord between Irish Catholics and African-Americans extended back to before the civil war.\\" p. ix) as distracting fallacies to emphasize the author's own theory of 'Reactionary Populism'.<br />But Reactionary Populism, defined within chapter eight of BOSTON AGAINST BUSING as \\"a movement that included the organized and unorganized, militants and moderates, terrorists as well as middle-class reformists respectful of democratic norms of civility.\\" (p. 172) is a crude oversimplification in the description of an indeterminate social class found in South Boston. Thus the author's theory of 'Reactionary Populism' becomes nothing more than another universal existance statement - an unfalsifiable assertion! Such divigations only propound the disparity between the author's notes to the content of his text, as the author eschewed the usual canons of evidence and logic to espouse a historically determinist system along the lines of such specious authors as: Hillson, Lukas, Lupo, and O'Connor. <br />Professor Formisano would only have strengthened his work if he had actually included interviews and opinions of Boston residents who were actually involved in the street demonstrations to have realized that the protest against busing centered on the use of 'force' to send kids to non-selected schools in dangerous areas; an acknowledgment of the federal judge's violation of the separation of powers act; and that the Boston schools were never segregated, 'de facto' or 'de jure' in the first place. As even the author indicated, Boston residents were not against the Racial Imbalance Act. But he omited that each of the several thousand protesters were individual eye-witnesses that the schools were neither segregated nor imbalanced. <br /> Instead, admiting he was unaffected and far away, the author's only source on South Boston were his graduate students or colleagues doing most of the research: (\\"...[they] called to my attention countless books, articles, and newspaper stories ... and sending them not only through the campus mail but even to Italy during the 1989 spring semester, where I continued to work on the manuscript while on a Fullbright.\\" p.xv)<br />Obviously this professor did not commit himself entirely to his text, and it showed in his work. So while historian Dr. Formisano was commuting outside of Boston between the city of Cambridge and the city of Worcester, on September 12th, 1974, the first day of forced busing in Boston, my fellow classmates and I walked into Southie High to begin our senior (fourth) year; then on December 11th, 1974, I witnessed a stabbing of a classmate outside the headmaster's office on the second floor adjacent to the trophy case! Yet neither myself nor any of my classmates had ever been interviewed by the journalistic or academic 'experts' on the topic of forced busing.<br />The book: BOSTON AGAINST BUSING, was only written in Boston's seventeenth year of forced busing. Today in its twenty-ninth year, South Boston High School is 95% black & hispanic in a 90% white neighborhood; Southie High had been declared officially 'dysfunctional' by the Massachusetts Board of Education; and the court order costs Boston taxpayers $25 million a year to implement. Yet, thanks to judicial interference, what was once an adequate school system has been reduced to a wasteland!<br />Invalid as history; the book: BOSTON AGAINST BUSING by history professor Ronald P. Formisano is a smugly written, unbalanced, and, considering the author's Ph.d. in history, a surprisingly biased inquiry into the nature of Boston's forced busing protest to promulgate a history professor's unfalsifiable assertion of 'reactionary populism'. This work of 'Ignoratio Elenchi' is neither political science, social science, nor sociology and cannot be recommended.	2003-04-05

Totally absent of critical inquiry; detached scholarship; or skilful historiographic technique, but containing a crude exercise in propaganda, the book: THE BATTLE OF BOSTON (c. 1977) by Jon Hillson, is a meretricious account of the first three years of forced busing in Boston (1974-1977) as presented by a writer for the 'Militant', the socialist workers party's sectarian newspaper. The BATTLE OF BOSTON is remarkable not only for its egregious dishonesty and absolute Marxist dogma, but also for the author's myriad logical fallacies of which two prominently standout.<br />The first is the 'argumentum ad assertion repetitio ad nauseam' (or fallacy of the repeated assertion), and from dozens which litter this book, the best example represented by the author was when the Afro-American president of the Boston N.A.A.C.P., attorney Thomas Atkins, gave a spiel to several hundred out-of-state leftist college students (p. 123) including Marxist groups such as: The Progressive Labor Party; Committee Against Racism; Spartacist League; The Maoist October League; and the All African People's Revolutionary Party in 1974, inside Hayden Hall at Boston University, attorney Atkins mindless advice was: \\"We must resist the dedicated racists who know what they are doing. We must resist the ignorant racists who are told what to do. We must resist the little racists who are being trained how to be big racists. We must resist the good people who aren't racists at all, but who are allowing themselves to be led by racists ...\\" (etc. etc.); and the author, Jon Hillson, permeated his entire book with these many variations of Lenin's 'Big Lie' i.e., that if a false accusation is shouted long enough and often enough, it might be believed. (From a false assertion, anything follows!)<br />The second prominent fallacy committed by Jon Hillson is his consant unintentional proof, in 'Ignoratio Elenchi', of the other point of view; this is one example from several - The large presence of Marxist agitators in Boston and a detailed description of their organizational skills permeates THE BATTLE OF BOSTON, yet the biggest hoot of this unintentionally amusing book is the author's constant emphasis of Marxist inspired pro-forced busing activity against the working class anti-forced busing groups such as: R.O.A.R.; the Marshals; Southie Defense League; and the United Labor Against Busing. Inanely, Jon Hillson provided the evidence, in 'Ignoratio Elenchi', of the working class rejection of Marxism in a photograph on page 250 of \\"two thousand construction workers\\" protesting forced busing. It seems incongruous that the working class would violently clash with members of all the Marxist organizations flooding Boston in 1974 as described in THE BATTLE OF BOSTON, if Marxism was representative of the working class cause.<br />The author espoused a crude conspiracy theory throughout THE BATTLE OF BOSTON but made no effort to substantiate any of his accusations or document any of his sources. The BATTLE OF BOSTON contains no footnotes, endnotes, or bibliography from which to verify any of the author's claims. Hypocritically, when it came to forced busing, this socialist author approved activity to seek court enforcement of the laws on the books (unlike those for Leonard Peltier or Mumia Abu-Jamal). Today, the legacy of forced busing is that South Boston High School is 95% black & hispanic in a 90% white neighborhood, and in 2003 South Boston High has been declared officially 'dysfunctional' by the Massachusetts Board of Education.  Thanks to judicial interference, what was once a viable school system has been reduced to a wasteland!<br />Jon Hillson's unbalanced and unreferenced work is useless as history or political science and it is merely a vehicle for the author to propound his own far-left politics. Yet the book: THE BATTLE OF BOSTON, still has value as a good example of the absolutist, dichotomous thinking and divisive identity politics which pervades Marxist methodology.pervades Marxist methodology.	2003-03-12

Written from the remove of an all-white suburb of Winthrop, Massachusetts, the book: 'LIBERTY'S CHOSEN HOME: The Politics of Violence in Boston' (c. 1977) by journalist Alan Lupo, is less of a scholarly inquiry into the violent aspects of Boston's history and more of an anti-South Boston political polemic.<br />The author exhibited a Marxist monomania throughout his work demonstrated by this statement on page 154, that: \\"Forces born more than a century before had clashed repeatedly, and now they were giving shape and substance to the ultimate battles of class warfare\\" as the left-wing determinist explanation for the vehement protest against court ordered forced busing in 1974 by concerned Boston neighborhood families.<br />By suggesting that the vehement protests against forced busing in 1974 by assimilated Irish Americans (and many others) in South Boston were a direct extension of the violent strikes by Irish Immigrants in the 1854 North End (Boston), the author had committed both an historical and logical error by suggesting that cities and people demonstrate \\"Timeless Qualities\\". In this, Alan Lupo 'Begged the Question' - he assumed the accuracy in his own statements without proof.<br />The lack of proof, 'ipse dixit', is the hallmark of this pretentious phillipic as non-sequiturs follow non-sequiturs to support unsubstantiated allegations. Among Alan Lupo's numerous dogmatic claims that are supposed to be consumed on their own 'a priori' is that: \\"The black street violence of today is as viscious as was the Irish brand a century ago.\\" (p. 16)  But how did the author know that? - He made no attempt to document his source.<br />The contribution to Boston's 'Mytho-history' by Alan Lupo can be found on page thirty, as the author related the excited outburst of an anti-forced busing protester in 1974 to then Mayor Kevin White that: \\"No matter how poor we were, Kevin, we always had clean lace curtains on our windows.\\" And through sheer hyperbole, this exclamation from a non-Irish woman found its way into another polemic as the long established Boston tradition of the 'Lace Curtain Irish'. ('LIBERTY'S CHOSEN HOME (c. 1977) should be read in tandem with the screed 'COMMON GROUND' (c. 1984) for adroit readers to recognize their clone-like similarities.)<br />The author, Alan Lupo, really does not have any insights into South Boston that are not truisms (\\"The strengthening of voluntary busing programs made more sense than forced busing.\\" p. 111); pointless facts (\\"Southie is a peninsula.\\" p. 5); 'ad hominem' attacks (\\"It [South Boston] is, in fact, a white ghetto.\\" p. 5); or well-poisoning (\\"A couple of alleged syndicate figures were in the room ... Nobody realized that day how important that segment of Boston society would become in the busing crisis.\\" p. 171); and coupled with his constant use of vague generalizations (\\"Time made Patriots of wharf rats and brawlers.\\" p. 10); plus three chapters of digressions, to promulgate a tenebrous theory of historical determinism.<br />All the author had to do was check with the Boston City Record to find out that in the summer of 1974 there were 240 Afro-American families living in South Boston; including a small colony of MicMac Indians from the Canadian Maritimes; not to mention that the Irish-American in South Boston were a vocal minority out numbered by Lithuanians, Polish, Italians, Estonians, Latvians, Albanians, Greeks, and Czeckoslavakians, to accurately show that South Boston was not 'all white'.  Also, that the most segregated and insulated of all Boston neighborhoods was Chinatown, not Charlestown! Mysteriously the Chinese-American was fortuitously spared both the color coding process as well as the collectivization process inflicted upon their caucasian neighbors!<br />The writing of History, as \\"the critical examination of source material into a synthesis of an explanation that will stand the test of critical methodology\\", is absent in LIBERTY\\"S CHOSEN HOME, as the author manipulated his information, from the safety of his suburb of Winthrop, Massachusetts, to comply with his historically determinant system.<br />No responsible researcher would use LIBERTY\\"S CHOSEN HOME as source material for an intelligent analysis of forced busing in Boston because of its constant comparison of two disassociate historical events throughout the book. This author had espoused such a tendentiously written tract of Marxist dialectic it is not surprising that LIBERTY'S CHOSEN HOME is out of print. Yet Alan Lupo's book still contains some merit as an example of 1970s leftist propaganda before the 1990 self-destruction of communism and the world recognition of Marxism as a psuedo-scientific cult.<br />For the most accurate examination of South Boston residents, please read: 'THAT OLD GANG OF MINE: A History of South Boston' (c. 1991) by Frank J.

George Orwell didn't seem to pay much attention to his own advice found in 'Politics and the English Language'.<br />The main character, Gordon Comstock, a struggling poet, lived in self-inflicted exile of poverty and decay to flee from the 'Money-God' and to rub elbows with his fellow working class heroes. Living in hovels, eating swill, falling into debt, dressing in tatters, working minimum wage jobs, allowing himself to become slightly malnutrishined, Gordon Comstock had romanticized the proletariat to the detriment of his health, social life, and career. He didn't seem to understand that these conditions are a dibilitating and not a fortifying aspect of working class life. Conditions despised by the very people he tried to emulate.<br />The simple Aspidistra, a potted plant, is Gordon's symbol of the middle class value system he detested. But the plant appears to be ubiquitous as it is found on every window sill of middle class family homes in England, from which Gordon is trying to flee. Then Gordon had a revelation that the middle class were the working class who had kept themselves respectable - had kept the Aspidistra flying. (This is a theme that occurs in later Orwell writings.)<br />Anyone with a college course in psychology would recognize that the character Gordon Comstock displayed symptoms of chronic depression; latent homosexuality; anxiety neurosis; bi-polar mood disorder; and obsessive guilt.<br />If, as some critics have suggested, this work is autobiographical of George Orwell, then the observation made by one of his biographers that, \\"The British are the only people who spend a lot of money to send their children to school to become emotionally damaged\\", was a process that afflicted George Orwell.<br />But who was this book written for? It would seem the author's fellow socialists. The author had to communicate his proletariat values somehow to his international fellow travelers! It always appears that socialists try to out-do each other's counter-bourgeois experiences. And KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING came across as a chronicle of leftist one-upmanship: the - I'm more working class than you are - attitude, by living shoulder to shoulder with the poor, then leaving when bored. (We call this 'slumming' in my working class neighborhood, and its annoying!). What is so original or novel about a struggling youth living his dream? KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING is more of a socialist polemic than an original story with a moral.<br />A good book to compare with 'KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING' is: 'WANDERER' by Sterling Hayden. Schooner captain Sterling Hayden gave a similar account of working class privation as he fled from a middle class background, then tramped around the U.S. following his nautical dream during the great depression, and was deeply influenced by American socialists of the time. Yet Sterling Hayden's poverty was real, not self imposed as Orwell's.<br />I found 'KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING' somewhat disappointing, but required reading as a fan of George Orwell.	2003-01-19

THE KILLING was originally published under the title CLEAN BREAK.\\"  The book, THE KILLING (c. 1988) by Lionel White, is a tightly written 155 page 'caper' novel that combined several personal stories together leading to a slightly anti-climatic ending, all into eleven short chapters.<BR>The author, Lionel White, must be credited for originating the non-linear story telling technique he used for the interplay of several disparate characters cooperating succesfully for a two million dollar robbery of a racetrack, during a major sweepstakes race, in broad daylight.<BR>Surprisingly well written and containing an articulate but streetwise writing-style, THE KILLING is the story of thirty-six year old career criminal Johnny Clay, who conjured-up in his mind a race track robbery during his four year stint in prison for larceny, and while out on parole, placed his theory into practice.  Recruiting five key 'inside' figures to pull off his heist, Johnny Clay then sub-contracted three professional hoods, outside of his amateur entourage, to perform necessary and unique diversions.<BR> Johnny Clay's inner circle included: George Peatty, a track cashier; Big Mike, race club bartender; Marvin Unger, a court stenographer with important connections; and Randy Kennan, city police officer and life-long friend of Johnny.<BR>The out-of-sequence, anti-structure idea of THE KILLING began in chapter eight, as Johnny Clay recruited Nikki, a hit man, who would shoot the lead race horse, 'Black Lightening', from a parking lot in his MG, using a 30.06 scoped rifle with silencer, and after the lot attendent brought him a program, the bit of suspense would end as Nikki drove off the lot, unharmed, mission accomplished.  Then again it dropped back in time as Johnny Clay hired Tex, a thug of a boxer, who then created a diversion at the bar, drawing away several Pinkertons from the 'Private Door'  Johnny must enter, by slapping the bartender, Big Mike, in theface before the shooting and then getting clubbed into submission after creating a minor disturbance.  Then another retrograde instance as Johnny Clay recruited a youth named Maurice Cohen, a skinny ex-con and ex-running back, to divert the police, and whoever else would follow Johnny out the Private Door once Johnny himself completed the two million dollar cash stick-up; so Johnny could do a quick change en route and melt into a hysterical crowd caused by the horse shooting.<BR> The logical plan went like clockwork as each key inside figure played out their role: Big Mike placed a flower box containing a .45 cal Thompson Submachine gun, 'the chopper', into a locker then nonchalantly goes back to work at the bar.  George Peatty also nonchalantly unlocked the Private Door from the inside, then simply went back to his ticket window, his small but important part completed. Then Johnny entered the opened Private Door unnoticed during Tex's barroom brawl, ran upstairs to the employees locker room, took the flower box out and into a toilet stall, assembled and loaded the tommy gun, then put on gloves and tied a handkerchief around his face, ran upstairs to the money office, pointed the 'chopper' at several armed guards, clerks, and secretaries; had them stuff two million dollars of the track's winnings into a green duffel bag he provided.  Johnny then backed out and locked the door, dropping the tommy gun on the floor and throwing the duffel bag out the window without hesitating an instant, then bolted down the stairs and out the Private Door disappearing into the mayhem he had created.  Police officer Randy Kennan, in uniform,  waiting outside the office building, then picked up the discarded duffel bag and tossed it into his police car, then quietly drove away. A well drawn map of the entire race track indicating each position of the participants is conveniently included on page forty-six of THE KILLING.<BR>The author further included some simple subplots in THE KILLINGas the motivations for each amateur participant in the robbery are revealed, most notably George Peatty.  Mr. Peatty's shrew wife, Sherry, instigated her own plots and schemes when her lovelorn husband bragged to her about the upcoming robbery.  She then engaged her ruthless gangster boyfriend, Val, into a plot to hijack their booty after the robbery.<BR>Things go wrong as Sherry had a sexual affair with police officer Randy Kennan enticing her husband's jealousy; then her boyfriend Val beats her half to death to extract the location of the meeting place for after the robbery.  Getting this information, Val and his hoods burst into the apartment where all the inside gang are waiting for the return of Johnny Clay with the money.   The lights go off as gunfire breaks out and several members are shot, including George Peatty, who escaped mortally wounded out a window, down a fire escape, with a revolver in his pocket.<BR>The ending of this interesting story on page 155 took place in LaGuardia Airport as the wounded and dazed George saw Johnny Clay with two suitcases full of money thinks he is cutting out and mistook Johnny's girlfriend, Fay, for his own wife, shot Johnny Clay several times in the stomach, in a fit of rage and jealousy.<BR>The book THE KILLING by Lionel White, was well written and easy to read in a single evening.  It contained the unique \\"axis of time\\" non-linear story telling technique which took a simple & straightforward robbery plot,turning it  into an interesting drama, with its \\"anti-structure\\" idea also transformed the work into a fascinating and  compelling crime novel.  It was no wonder that director Stanley Kubrick chose the work of Lionel White to base his 1956 movie 'THE KILLNG' .	2002-11-09

Oct 2002) by Mrs. Christiane Kubrick, is an insightful photographic odyssey of Stanley Kubrick, America's very original and probably only auteur director.<br />Mrs. Kubrick presented, in chronological order, rare family photographs of Stanley Kubrick from his childhood in the Bronx and through his teenage years in high school and working for LOOK magazine.  This included his very first 1945 photograph of a newspaper vendor he sold for twenty-five dollars to that publication.<br />The chronology then continued as a mix of Stanley Kubrick in his various movie publicity stills and with candid photographs of the behind the scenes activity as Director Kubrick lined up his shots on movie cameras; interacted with his crew; conversed with his stars; \\"having a little game of chess\\"; or the very obvious serious discussions with cast and technicians. (The pictures of Stanley Kubrick cracking-up laughing on the set of '2001' are priceless; as are the touching photographs of him holding his young children.) The photographs continued until the filming of his last movie, 'Eyes Wide Shut', showing a mature and greying director.<br />And for those who follow the interesting lives of the actors in his films, 'STANLEY KUBRICK: A Life In Pictures' provided dozens of revealing off-camera images of his interactions with such noted personalities as: Marlon Brando; Kirk Douglas; Lawrence Olivier; James Mason; George C. Scott; and Sterling Hayden.  Equally as interesting as his cinematographic technique was his managerial style as he presided over some of Hollywood's most powerful movie stars, dozens of cast and crew, and sometimes thousands of extras, which one can only infer from the objectivity of this black & white photographic collection.<br />This collection contained a touch of poignancy as photo #57 showed a publicity still of Stanley Kubrick, Sterling Hayden, and Kola Kwariani pouring over a chess game together in the chess club set of 'TheKilling'.  In this 1956 movie, Kola Kwariani played professional wrestler Maurice Oboukhoff, who instigated a very memoriable diversion for the race track robbery.  In real life, Kola Kwarinani was a real wrestler and expert chess player who played in the same New York 'Chess & Checker Club' (alias The Flea House) as Stanley Kubrick.  The neighborhood changed, and in February 1980 at age 77 while playing in 'The Flea House' Kola Kwariani was beaten to death by five black teenage hoodlums.<br />The book: 'STANLEY KUBRICK: A Life In Pictures' is neither biography nor history but simply an important collection of objective photography mutely capturing the working details, values, and personality of America's only world class movie director.  <br />As a suggestion, first read the biography: 'STANLEY KUBRICK: A Biography' (c.1997) by Vincent LuBrutto, to fully appreciate  Mrs. Christiane Kubrick's impressive photographic compilation.  Only then does the revealing photographs of her husband answer the many questions induced by all the incomplete written biographies on Stanley Kubrick.	2002-11-01

Despite reading 'The Mountains of Madness'; 'The Tomb'; and particularly 'Pickman's Model' in a brightly lit, populated main hall of the Boston Public Library in mid-day, I was still creeped out of my skin by the writing skill of this author - thus I became an H.P. Lovecraft advocate!  But I wanted more.  I wanted the full H.P. Lovecraft experience!   I decided to read 'THE LURKING FEAR And Other Stories' (c.1939, 1985) by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, overnight in the small graveyard on Emerson & E. 5th streets, Hawes,  adjacent to the grade school I attended as a kid.  So with book under arm, I left my local watering hole at last call and walked down a dark street, took a left, and stood in front of the small 1840s Hawes graveyard &#34;where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below&#34;.  Yup, this will do nicely.   So I hopped the low black wrought-iron spiked fence, sat down near a street light, coupled with a bright beacon October moon which casted &#34;charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and streaked the region&#34;.  I sat on a grave and leaned against a chipped and cracked slate headstone, and in this very un-library like atmosphere, began to read THE LURKING FEAR.   I sat comfortably &#34;where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light&#34; and suddenly saw a rat run across a nearby grave. Uh, no problem, since rats are as common as seagulls in Boston; I finished  part-one of THE LURKING FEAR in dark and shadow, when I suddenly jolted an inch off the grave recoiling my hand like lightning &#34;for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination.&#34;   The wind had blown a wet leaf on my hand in the dark and I yelped like a puppy.  I resumed reading THE LURKING FEAR after my tachycardia and hyperventilation had subsided.  The streetlight went out for someunknown reason and I was forced to finish THE LURKING FEAR, appropriately, by moonlight.   H.P. Lovecraft was criticized for a wordy adjectival writing style which his proponents, including myself, admired for setting 'atmosphere' to his storytelling.  His use of the first person narrative only added to the distance of the author from the reader, so the reader would feel absolutely connected with the characters in the story, and, through analogy, feel the terror they experienced. Other writers of horror, particularly the very ineffective Stephen King, have not mastered atmospheric writing.  In THE LURKING FEAR the author conveyed this sense of connection as he brought the reader, through the narrative of his nameless investigator, to Tempest Mountain, then inside the Martense Mansion and in the graves and tunnels of the elusive inhuman quarry.   So by the time I finished reading THE LURKING FEAR in this neglected neighborhood graveyard, the author had done his stuff and I was covered in a cold sweat from head to toe.  My hands were clammy, unusually white and waxlike, and strangely still as H.P. Lovecraft finished the story describing the multitude of ape-like things which swarmed out of the tunnels near Martense mansion as &#34;the ultimae product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome of isolated spawning, multiplication, and cannibal nutrition above and below the ground; the embodiment of all the snarling chaos and grinning fear that lurk behind life&#34;.  This last exposition of H.P. Lovecraft in THE LURKING FEAR suddenly made me curious of the name on the headstone I was leaning.  It was my name!   They found my body in the morning: I had received the full H.P. Lovecraft experience.	2002-10-15

'SEAMANSHIP IN THE AGE OF SAIL: An Account of the Shiphandling of the Sailing Man-Of-War 1600-1860, Based on Contemporary Sources'(c.1984) by John Harland, is probably one of the most informative and valuable collections of useful knowledge on sailship handling in the late 20th century!<br />A major value of this work is its ability to answer the questions developed during today's contemporary square rig sailing.  It fully explained why sailboats are pulled by the wind and not pushed (Bernouilli's Principle); the advantages and disadvantages of square rig sailing over fore &amp; aft sailing (downwinds &amp; length of luff); why large square rig ships don't need a center board (a shifting of CLR, CG, &amp; G); or why all sails were never set on a square rig when simply cruising (courses don't draw in a well).<br />The book is punctuated with pen &amp; ink drawings as well as period photographs and deguerrotypes of ships in the act of a sail evolution or other shipboard activity.  And in a time period where photography was not yet invented, the author used contemporary paintings of vessels to demonstrate an aspect of ship handling.  Going further back into history, the author delved into the archeological record to demonstrate the origin or existance of a ship component pertinent to his ship handling argument.<br />SEAMANSHIP IN THE AGE OF SAIL further provided continuity answers as to why sails are shaped the way they are; or why the steeve of the bowsprit was lessened over time.  The book gave valuable points on how to rig a ship while underway; how to rig the stun'sls; how to rig the braces, lifts, tacks, sheets, clews, and bunts; how to raise and lower heavy sails; how to bend sails to the spars; how to box haul or club haul the ship; and why the main topsail halyard is a heart attack waiting to happen.<br />Just as the serious and ambitious mate or deckhand in the 1700s was caught with a copy of Bowditch ('Practical Navigator') in his seachest; in the 2000s you can watch a mate or an ambitious O.S. walk up the brow to his sailship with a copy of SEAMANSHIP IN THE AGE OF SAIL tucked under his arm.  Despite its large size and bulk, this book is well worth taking along into the cramped crews quarters for an informed reading at night.<br />SEAMANSHIP IN THE AGE OF SAIL is a wonderful archive of esoteric sailship handling maneuvers, equipment, gear, and nautical science.  The author has done a wonderful job in his research and has provided a great resource to all sailing ship captains and mates.	2002-10-12

In his work, THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNOTS (c.2000), Mr. Geoffrey Budsworth, a retired British police inspector and now an important knot tying enthusiast, has provided a 160 page coffee table book with just eighty-two examples of the 3,900 knots found in Ashley's, in big color glossy pictures.<br />Each colored photograph is accompanied by a clear tonal computer drawing of how to form the bend, hitch, knot, or braid, and a brief description of its application. Pointing, hitching, or grafting are absent as well as fender making or rope mats. The work covered only useful knots, and this brevity serves a purpose. By displaying all the practical information on a single page, Mr. Budworth had wisely provided an instant learning forum at a glance. This is important so that no time is wasted while instructing semi-literate co-workers the way a knot is meant to be tied and used while standing in the rain, snow, or under a blazing sun. I hope other knot books adopt a similar presentation style.<br />The size of the book is a drawback though, and since most knot application discussions take place on site, THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNOTS might be covered in paint, tar, or bird mess as it gets carted around under piers, engine rooms, aloft, or other dank places which would injure those glossy photographs.<br />There are a few shortcomings - One is that the book hardly fits the description of an 'encyclopedia', and might be subject to misinterpretation; and two, the book contains two serious knot tying errors: first on page 140, item #2 in the Lapp Knot, and second on page 31, item #4 in that the Miller's Knot is actually a Strangle Knot, which I'm sure the author had no control over the editorial process (including the Granny Knot on the front cover).<br />Overall, THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNOTS contains good knot history, cordage history, and pragmatic tying and use instruction in a brief and thorough format. This book will have many applications other than hitching a ride in a rigger's bucket up a mast, flagpole, or bridge stanchion.THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNOTS contains good knot history, cordage history, and pragmatic tying and use instruction in a brief and thorough format.

Using hand drawings that are clearer than any photograph, THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR (c.1960) by Hervey Garrett Smith illustrated in a 131 page soft cover book a collection of the best detailed renditions of basic knot tying and ropework any beginner can learn to start his ropework career, or for an old hand to refresh his memory.<br />There is no waste as only essential rope skills are shown in clear etchings, line drawings, and pencil sketches, which will make the wooden sail boat owner self-sufficient from a lot of expensive, store-bought textile gear.<br />In a written text accompanying each excellent drawing, Hervey Garrett Smith explained the purpose of each rope related product; such as: knob knots used for drawer handles, baggy wrinkle for chafe gear, coach whipping for stanchion rails, rope shackles for your storage chest, sewing skills to make gear bags and sail mending, netmaking for storage, and rope fenders for hull protection.  The author included no superfluous skills or fancy work (MacNamara's Lace as we called it in the Navy).<br />There is more than a hint of Yankee frugality pervading THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR as Hervey Garrett Smith promotes self-sufficiency through recycling old rope and canvas, or anything else that can be salvaged and made useable.<br />THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR is an important and useful book for the beginner to teach themselves the fundamental skills necessary to quickly make oneself a useful member of any traditional sailboat crew.

Ashley, is the definitive reference work on knots, splices, and ropework in general.  Born in 1881 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Clifford W. Ashley was an antique dealer and artist, who spent eleven years writing his magnum opus, THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS, and died three years after its 1944 publication.<br />In his pursuit of ropework, Mr. Ashley spent six months at sea on the whaling bark SUNBEAM; and six weeks on a Delaware Bay oysterman called a 'bugeye'.  He interviewed tradesmen, such as: steeplejacks, cobblers, truckdrivers, butchers, electric linesmen, and boyscouts as well as sailors and sea captains to document each nuance of knot unique to its trade.  He was taught a few knots by Mr. Ringling himself of circus fame; and taught a knot to Mr. DuPont, a captain of industry.<br />The result of Mr. Ashley's research was a significant collection of 7,000 drawings of 3,900 knots and their application in a 620 page knot tyers tome which has become a veritable bible for rope workers the world over.  In just about any capacity that a rope can be utilized has found its way into THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS.  Mr. Ashley has covered: netting, lashings, block &amp; tackle, splices, hitches, and bends.  He went from purely decorative knots with no practical value to knots applied to industrial use.  He included a whole chapter on rope tricks and puzzles.  There is an amusing catalog of small figures the author drew to rate the quality of each knot described, such as a deuce of clubs to designate 'unimportance', or an kedge anchor to indicate 'reliability'.<br />Equally important as the knot's description was their utilization on incidental equipment.  Mr. Ashley fortuitously included a description of a rope's application on fairleads, belaying pins, H-bitts, cleats, thumb-cleats, fife rails, pin rails, pin racks, and timberheads; as well as escoteric equipment such as euphroe blocks and crows foots. <br />The book also includes the important distinction between the kevel (or cavil) and the quarter cleat.  The glossary in the back makes another refinement by distinguishing the knot from the sinnet, splice, hitch, and bend.  Thus clearing up any misassumptions in knot application (such as that Knot Theory is a branch of pure mathematics and has nothing to do with Knot Tying!) - THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS settles any disputes in nomenclature.<br />The only short-coming to this significant work is that the drawings are unclear and vague in some instances, making it impossible to tye a knot in the example given.  The book is dated in respect to splicing modern power braids such as Liquid Crystal Polymer, Spectra, or Kevlar; and makes no mention of the type of knot or splice found in an Astronaut's tether.<br />Still this can be tolerated in view of the wealth of information and history on knots, splices, and rope contained within its pages.  And THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS has gained a further importance in its power of verification.  For when some nimrod claims to have invented a new knot or splice, immediately the universal response is: &quot;Just look it up in Ashley's!&quot;	2002-10-10

TEACH YOURSELF CHESS (c.1996) by Bill Hartston, is a great book for the absolute beginner in chess for its ability to answer questions, and in its facility to instill a curiosity to further pursue the game!<br />The author immediately brought the novice up through the ranks, step-by-step, with simple direct language, which avoided confusion and dispair. From a good description of all the moves of each individual chess piece; to a prudent explanation of the need to know chess notation if you ever plan on improving your game through other books or just to follow a tournament in a newspaper; to an good introduction of the rules; followed with important basic endgames, and elementary tactics; leading up to endgame strategy, strategic planning, then basic opening strategy. Bill Hartston never applied pressure to the beginner to learn more than they should discouraging interest. <br />The author then did a valuable thing - he included a chapter on illustrative games from Grandmasters in chess and from World Championships.  This can only increase an appreciation of the game and to promote a sense of identity and purpose onto the beginner for the pursuit of more chess knowledge.<br />Still TEACH YOURSELF CHESS was initially a little over my head, and I would recommend SAMURAI CHESS as a primer for its ability to make a comparison with a familiar theme - the martial arts.  Only then was I able to draw analogies and absorb basic chess theory with application from Bill Hartstson's work.  For example, the chess 'Expert' rating was explained in SAMURAI CHESS to be the equivalent of a Shodan, or, a first degree black belt, which immediately imparted to me a sense of proportion to all the chess ratings and abilities mentioned by Bill Hartstson. (For instance; unless you're a prodigy, it takes 8-10 years of hard work for a black belt in Judo and everything that goes with it, so I assume its the same for chess). <br />TEACH YOURSELF CHESS is a valuable tool for the autodidatic chessenthusiast which will allow them to apply its knowledge directly to a game of chess; and with its chapter on chess notation and illustrative games, this book allows one to increase their ability in the game.  TEACH YOURSELF CHESS by Bill Hartstson is definately a well thought out learning implement for self starters. This is a book to give your son, daughter, young relative, or pal as soon as they show an interest in chess!!	2002-09-29

The autobiography WANDERER (c.1963, 2000) by Sterling Hayden, is a narrative written in the first and third person of a man who became enamoured with working sail at an early age, and in its pursuit, acquired a multitude of diverse life experiences few people have achieved, and/or, depending on your viewpoint, would want.<br />The author has compiled a litany of accomplishment simply by writing about the lifestyle he loved best. Sterling Hayden was a dory fisherman in the Grand Banks as a teenager; captained a two masted brig from Boston to Tahiti at age 22; he then became one of the youngest Master Mariners at age 24; sailed around the world twice; sailed to Tahiti several times; was the protege of the top men in his field such as: Robert O. White (Instrument Maker); Irving Johnson, Lincoln Colcord, and Ben Pine. He was also a mate on board the Gloucesterman 'Gertrude L. Thebaud' in its historic race against the big Canadian saltbanker'Bluenose'. He dined with the President of the United States; became a movie star; married a movie star; starred in two Stanley Kubrick productions; became wealthy and became broke; was an enlisted man then a Marine Corp officer; test-ran some of the first PT boats for the U.S. Navy; became an intelligence officer in the Balkans during W.W.II with the nascent O.S.S. and met with its founder 'Wild Bill' Donovan; and testified before the Senate Committee investigating un-American activities in Hollywood.  Even from his best jobs Sterling Hayden would willingly descend down the social ladder as drifter, vagabond, and working sailor, because to him they were all interchangeable.<br />Taking his natural abilities and high innate intelligence for granted, Sterling Hayden essentially gravitated to the forefront of every occupation he fell into, and didn't know why. This is one source for the author's angst, that is, his unconscious attraction to the elite, and then when excelling in that particular field with a talent he is unaware and doesn't understand, developed a mental fugue and leaves.<br />Such is the nature of the existentialist who collects life experiences to build his character rather than material goods to increase his mercantile wealth. Sterling Hayden measured his wealth in a different way and just as a rich man might judge a man who lacked money, Sterling Hayden judged men throughout WANDERER who lacked character.<br />Yet Hayden fled from a broken home and his nomadic existence and unstable environment came with a price; the author suffered from alcoholism, depression, conflict, obsessive guilt, and anxiety neurosis. His autobiography is tinged with regret.<br />But Sterling Hayden's autobiography is valuable for the first hand view of Grandbanks fishing schooners during the 1930s; the actual terminology of the fishermen he represents; his first hand accounts of depression era Boston - his experiences in East Boston and South Boston, his employment with fisherman on Boston's old 'T' wharf; and his friendship with Lawrence Patrick Joseph O'Toole (of the South Boston O'Tooles) who pushed Hayden into his acting career; and Hayden's account of Hollywood agents and 'B' movie contracts.<br />The autobiography WANDERER by Sterling Hayden, should be required reading in any philosophy, sociology, psychology, or political science course; and it also makes fascinating reading of the interesting life of a complicated man.uthor's angst, that is, his unconscious attraction to the elite, and then when excelling in that particular field with a talent he is unaware and doesn't understand, developed a mental fugue and leaves. <br />Such is the nature of the existentialist who collects life experiences to build his character rather than material goods to increase his mercantile wealth.

Vincent LoBrutto concentrates on the interesting behind-the-scenes business dealings Mr. Kubrick contends with in Hollywood.  He also describes Stanley Kubrick's initial inspiration to photography in high school; the exertion and drive Kubrick demonstrated to complete a film; his relationships with some of Hollywood's biggest stars; Kubrick's impartial business decision to make movies in England; his experiences with contracts, lawyers, and lawsuits; the polite opinions of cohorts and co-workers regarding Mr. Kubrick himself; a few of Mr. Kubrick's own views regarding his life pursuing cinema; and his hobbies, marriages, and habits.<br />The biography falls short in one regard that it paints too good a portrait of a director who allegedly never lost his temper; it glosses over any motivation for his two divorces; it emphasized some personal information (such as he liked hot dogs) and de-emphasized others (was Kubrick right-handed or left-handed? or was Kubrick a rated chess player?).  The book further does not explore the differences between brilliance and genius: would Stanley Kubrick have been able to pass the test to join Mensa?<br />Using secondary and tertiary sources typical of biographies, Vincent LoBrutto fails to capture the historic Stanley Kubrick with this work steeped in the mechanical aspects of his subject's life.  Sparing the reader a lot of technical jargon regarding Stanley Kubrick's cinematographic technique, Vincent LoBrutto does delve in the personal view and values which contributed to Stanley Kubrick's initial motivation to make movies.<br />Yet this is just one single biography, and as more information regarding Stanley Kubrick comes to light, more biographies about this auteurdirector should be writtened and read (there are 400 biographies on Ghandi) to fully capture all the facets, good and bad of a brilliant director.  A contrasting biographical technique, to be read in conjunction with this work, would be: STANLEY KUBRICK: A BIOGRAPHY (c1997) by John Baxter, which adds some additional information not covered by Vincent LoBrutto.	2002-09-21

Uncompromising to Stanley Kubrick, STANLEY KUBRICK: A BIOGRAPHY (c.1997) by John Baxter, is a first order inquiry which took the Suetonian view towards biography and depicted its subject as a gelid autuer director motivated by an obsessive/compulsive need to control his environment in order to materialize his artistic vision on film. John Baxter focused on the opinions, observations, and views of those who worked for Stanley Kubrick; and also those who claimed to have been alienated by him.<br />Apparently following the advice of former British prime minister Lloyd George when that prime minister stated:  \\"All biographies should be written by an acute enemy\\", John Baxter picked up on every error, mistake, and indecision of Stanley Kubrick in the course of his career. This gave Stanley Kubrick a historical perspective which included a somewhat realistic account of the man behind some of America's most influential motion pictures ever produced.<br />Yet biography is not history and John Baxter's work contained some obvious logical and historic errors as when he included a photograph indicating actress Ms. Suzanne Christiane as Kubrick's future second wife; or in his bibliography giving Vincent LoBrutto's book of Kubrick a copyright of 1996  - yet in Lobrutto's work, the T.P. verso indicated 1997 as the copyright. <br />Kubrick's intelligence, or motive, was also brought into question by John Baxter as he included in his book an explanation of Kubrick's compulsive notetaking by erudite British actress Ms. Adrienne Corri that \\"All this notetaking is just a way of accumulating what other people know\\" and also, \\"He (Kubrick) was not an intelligent or a curious man\\". But one need only to have seen in 1968 the premeire of  '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 'Cinerama' (with the wrap-around screen) to be convinced that there was a brilliance behind its direction. But Baxter alluded to brilliance only in the sense of a Bobby Fischer or of a Thomas Edison - that is, brilliant in a limited and focused capacity.<br />While John Baxter's bibliography on Stanley Kubrick included some obvious short-comings to the careful reader, it also contained some undeniable eyewitness observations of the subject's character. <br />A good book to read in accompany with John Baxter's view is: 'STANLEY KUBRICK: A Biography'(c.1997) by Vincent LoBrutto, which gives a kinder Plutarchian view of its subject. It would be advantageous to also read: 'STANLEY KUBRICK: A Life In Pictures' (c. 2002) by Mrs. Suzanne Kubrick, with her objective collection of mostly black & white Kubrick photographs, mostly shot in his studios.   <br />With new information appearing all the time, the definitive biography on Stanley Kubrick has yet to be written (there are 400 biographies on Mahatma Ghandi) and both John Baxter and Vincent LoBrutto's account are good starting points on the life of Stanley Kubrick.	2002-09-21

BEST JUDO (c.1979, hardcover) began with the useful emphasis of the basics in the first chapter. Chapter one also contained the author's explanation that \\"Judo practice takes the form of a fight, but no matter how fierce the practice may be, it's object is to improve your technique and train your spirit.\\"  Unlike their Western counterparts, the Japanese Judo coaches have not lost sight of this very important aspect of Judo.    Then the basics are proceeded in the following chapters by what can only be described as photographic evidence of the ferocity and perfection of applied nage waza and katame waza as only the Japanese champions can impart.  Clear and precise black & white photographs demonstrate Tawara Gaeshi (rice bag reversal)p.77; Obitori Gaeshi (belt grab reversal)p.80; and an excellent 1979 photographic portrayal of the Tobi Juji-Gatame (flying juji-gatame)pgs. 144-145.  One need only to look at the faces of these champions, which resemble the battered mugs of professional boxers, to realize the intensity and spirit with which the Japanese practice their Judo. Such motivation surely transcends material acquirement.    BEST JUDO is important for its collection of the proven techniques of classical Japanese Judo that have actually brought the authors to the forefront of world competition.  It is a collection of the practical tournament technique of the Gokyo No Waza which the Japanese use today to outclass the desperate Western reliance on koka or penalty win (or Golden Score) Judo for their individualistic victories.    In the conclusion of BEST JUDO, after dozens of photographs documenting dynamic technique, one of the authors, Mr. Isao Inokuma,on page 236, made the important summation that: \\"Judo is not only a sport to be engaged in only [sic] at the dojo\\".  It's internal message and acquired spirit has application on the workfront, homefront, and daily life - and this is the real genius of Dr. Jigoro Kano's Judo.  Sadly, at age 63, Isao Inokuma sensei committed suicide in September of 2001!  I gave this tremendous book only four stars because as a dramatic presentation of Judo, it is second only to VITAL JUDO by Isao Okano.	2002-09-14

In THE JUDO TEXT BOOK: IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION (C1979) by Mr. Hayward Nishioka, and others, has managed to reduce the thirty-six throws of the Gokyu No Waza into ten techniques he has personally decided, over Kodokan wisdom, to teach to a beginner.<br />Starting off with such fundamentals as obi tying; Judo gi folding; rei-ing; and all the basic falls; the author proceeds to demonstrate his preferred Nage Wazas while shrewdly including photographs of the same technique being applied in shiai by a past Judo great in international tournament: such as Anton Geesink winning with Sotomaki Komi or Isao Okano winning with Ippon Seoinage.<br />The book also contains a copy of out-dated IJF contest rules; sections on the positive power of Judo thinking; pep talks; some basic newaza techniques; excellent historical photographs of Judo legends; some photos from past Black Belt magazines; some interesting historic photographs of Dr. Jigoro Kano; and on martial arts masters unrelated to Judo, as if the author is unaware of the deeper facets of Judo other than tournament.<br />While the founder of Judo and genius, Dr. Jigoro Kano, insisted for good reason, that the ratio of Judo training to be: Randori: 80%, Kata: 17%, and Shiai: 3%; Mr. Hayward Nishioka devotes his book a full 100% to Shiai neglecting the other more important aspects of Judo, such as kata training.<br />Since France has won several Olympic gold medals in Judo compared to America's none, and they emphasize the 'Kaeshi No Kata' (form of counters) training from beginning to end in all their Judo practice, it is amazing that Hayward Nishioka, and other US Judo instructors, haven't picked up on this correlation?<br />The work: THE JUDO TEXT BOOK: IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION is too basic for advanced players, and too inappropriate for the beginner. It is worth the money for the collection of historical photographs and some of the vintage photographs of legendary competitors and masters.  But this is still a contributionof Western Judo trying to undermine the integrity of Japanese Judo!	2002-09-12

With the contemporary emphasis of using unorthodox methods for the mere winning of medals in koka Judo tournaments by both the Europeans and Americans, and with their concurrent introduction of non-Judo technique into the international arena in a 'win-at-all-costs' attitude, the book KODOKAN JUDO by the founding genius Dr. Jigoro Kano has become more important than ever as a baseline and standard for which 'Modern' Judo is to be gauged and, hopefully, corrected.<br />KODOKAN JUDO covers every aspect of Judo from its inception through 10th dan with an explanation for each progression: the reason for etiquette; an explanation of ukemi; the purpose of uchi komi; the need for randori; the absolute necessity of kata; Judo self defense methods; and basic first aid - all in terms to promote maximum efficiency.<br />KODOKAN JUDO also contains historical photographs of advanced Judo players and past masters, including Dr. Jigoro Kano himself, demonstrating all the nage waza found in the Gokyo No Waza; all the hold downs in Katame-Waza; and all of Judo's Atemi-Waza (striking & kicking techniques). Judo contains a number of self defense methods against the knife, sword, kicks, and punches, contained in detailed photographs in KODOKAN JUDO which are totally over-looked in today's Judo books emphasizing mere tournament play.<br />KODOKAN JUDO is the essential book for the dedicated Judoka to study for dan advancement; to answer questions on why one should learn a particular technique or a kata; and to clear up any misconceptions which might develop because of tournament.  Within its tenets are the standards established by the founder for which Judo is meant to be practised; the ratio is - Randori: 80%; Kata: 17%; and Shiai: 3%.  The reduction of contest to 3% of the Judo repetoire was intentional, since Judo was invented by Dr. Kano as a lifelong methodology to improve the human character and not just a sport for the petty pursuit of trophies.<br />There is a ... to change Judounder the euphemism of 'Evolution'; but evolution is a process which also leads to extinction. To overemphasize one aspect of Judo (such as tournament play) diminishes Judo in it entirety, and the founder makes this perfectly clear this was not his intent in his tome.<BR>Judo is in danger of possibly becoming extinct by the Europeans and Americans!<br />KODOKAN JUDO by Dr. Jigoro Kano has been elevated to the most important book on the subject as the unimpeachable standard in today's climate of the manipulation of Judo for Olympic political leverage against the Japanese custodianship of Dr. Kano's legacy.	2002-09-12

JUDO HEART &amp; SOUL (c2000) by Mr. Hayward Nishioka is not an instructive manual to improve your Judo technique (read his book: 'The Judo Text Book in Practical Application' (c1979) for that) but is a 255 page collection of advice and viewpoints on Judo by one of America's very accomplished and influential Judo players complete with a compilation of historic photographs; and is valuable in one can acquire a sense of tournament Judo over the past four decades.  Any American Judo player would be proud to be half as accomplished as this author!<br />Now, the first annoying flaw in this book is Mr. Nishioka's advocacy of the evolution in Judo, away from the traditional Japanese view, while at the same time quoting Japanese advice, wisdom, philosophy, adages, training tips, and his own Japanese training in Japan to validate his knowledge on the subject.  His endorsement of Judo reform had already appeared prior to this book as early as January 1970 in his Black Belt magazine article entitled: 'Judo vs. Wrestling' in which Hayward Nishioka made it perfectly clear that he approved of wrestling technique, or anything that worked, being introduced into Judo, euphemistically calling it  &quot;enrichment&quot;.  Yet the undermining futuristic observation included in his own article was a Judo competitor's prophetic observation that a third type of sport may be born from the combination of wrestling and Judo; as all the while spectators were screaming: &quot;Boo, that's not Judo!&quot; to a shiai they paid to see.<br />I feel the Japanese and the Kodokan are aware of this potential Judo hybrid disaster waiting to happen, and are taking steps to preserve the integrity of the art.  Evolution is a natural process which contains both mutation and extinction.  A small amount of mutation has already been observed in Judo from the introduction of wrestling and S.A.M.B.O. techniques into Olympic Judo of the 1980s and 90s and Mr. Nishioka should understand why the Japanese do not wantJudo to evolve into extinction.<br />The second major flaw in this book still revolves around the author's advocacy of change in Judo (p.110) while insisting that Judo rules remain fixed, for example his assertion &quot;Like it or not, koka is here to stay&quot; (p. 114).  There is an inherent contradiction to promote change then invoke an absolute!  If there is going to be evolution in Judo than both the koka rule and the inclusion of non-Judo technique (or hopefully, the baby blue gi) are subject to change; specifically: be removed!  Again, compounding this fallacy is the author's promotion of koka Judo (p.114) while advocating &quot;Isho Kemei&quot; - Do the very best you can (p.31) which is quite the opposite of accepting and practicing koka Judo.  Just as affirmative action programs have lowered standards in business and education within American society,  koka Judo has similarly lowered standards in the international society of tournament Judo.<br />The Japanese still have the best Judo in the world, and Mr. Hayward Nishioka of all people, having studied in Japan, should promote and not hinder this Japanese gift to the world.  <br />All-in-all, JUDO HEART &amp; SOUL is a good read for the intermediate Judo player because of its insight into what lies down the road for anyone who devotes himself to just winning Judo trophies and medals.	2002-09-12

JUDO TECHNIQUES & TACTICS (c.2001) by Jimmy Pedro Jr., and William Durbin, is a fundamental book on Judo like a dozen other books covering the same basic techniques, except this has one of New England's premiere judokas demonstrating kyu techniques.        If 1999 World Judo Champion and two time Olympic bronze medal winner Jimmy Pedro jr. is through making history and fails to be elected as president of the USJI (Judo USA), then it is hoped that Godan Jimmy Pedro Jr. will become a much needed world class sensei to teach and write for future American judoka! So what we really need is for Jimmy Pedro Jr. and his father, Jimmy Pedro Sr., to collaborate on a book detailing all their best competition judo techniques and philosophy and how they were derived, and between these two active and successful competitors, that book would have the potential as the new bible on American judo!      This basic sankyu level work: JUDO TECHNIQUES & TACTICS falls well beneath the talent and scope of World Champion and Olympian (Godan) Jimmy Pedro Jr..   To read a similar mediocre book on judo by another World Champion, please read: 'OLYMPIC JUDO: Throwing Techniques' (c. 1987) by Neil Adams.	2002-09-11

Smullyan makes inappropriate comparisons with Buddhism and is confused from the historical perspective. Dr. Smullyan seems to be unaware of the major doctrinal differences between Buddhism and Taoism which cumulated in the Taoist Wudang temple's participation in the destruction of the Buddhist Shaolin temple in Fujian in 1768. Further differences include: that Taoist priests wear their hair long while Buddhist monks shave their heads; Taoism emphasizes the internal while Buddhism emphasizes the external; Taoists pursue longevity while Buddhists pursue spiritual development;   Taoist kung fu is a soft style while Buddhist kung fu is a hard style; and Taoism emphasizes immortality over Buddhist reincarnation. For Dr. Smullyan to quote from the Zen Buddhist sutras to illuminate a point on Taoism is as awkward and inaccurate as quoting from the Jewish Talmud to illuminate a point on Roman Catholicism!  This author would have strengthened his thesis if he had actually included the opinions of Taoist priests and Buddhist monks rather than his mathematician's interpretation of a very deep and profound religion!	2002-09-06

THE CHESS MYSTERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by Raymond M. Smullyan was predictable from beginning to end.  Immediately Dr. Smullyan admits he doesn't like or play chess yet proceeds to use chess as a vehicle to demonstrate 'retrograde analysis' as though it were unique to chess.  Any human being who has mastered his trade, craft, or profession has probably routinely reconfigured his work to identify a prior characteristic.  Retrograde analysis is common to anyone skilled at their occupation and the adroit have no need to read this book to learn a commonly acquired skill. (The unadroit will simply continue as they are.) I further think this book will disappoint both chess players and Sherlock Holmes fans, and contribute nothing for students of logic.	2002-09-05

SAMURAI CHESS by Mr. Michael J. Gelb and Mr. Raymond Keene puts things in perspective for the neophyte chess player and gives one a basis of comparison with a familiar theme - the martial arts.  I've poured through several chess books which were all too advanced and gave skant attention to a beginner chess player, but as a dedicated Judo and Jiu-Jitsu practioner, I was finally able to absorb some basic chess concepts through this book and the author's ability to draw a martial arts analogy. Yet the only flaw is that the Japanese already consider the Asian game of 'Go' a martial art equal to Karate or Kendo and they give those 'Go' players hard won Dan or Black Belt ratings; and this is hardly appropriate to Western chess, which is, after all, only a game!	2002-09-04

In his book, BOSTON RIOTS, Prof. Tager is guilty of semantic manipulation as he redefines the word 'riot' to fit his politically correct neo-Marxist interpretation of Boston history.  For example, I was personally involved in a few of the anti-forced busing demonstrations mentioned in 'Boston Riots' yet no riot of any kind broke out.  Professor Tager writes myopically being unaffected and far away from his subject matter. He strangely omits the fact that some of the scuffles which broke out in front of my high school, South Boston High, were instigated by the Tactical Police Force (T.P.F.).  It is a singular point in history that Boston has never had a riot.	2002-07-24

A good poetry book combined with some classic ko-angs (Japanese: koans); spiced with Korean 'Hwardu's; the founding master gives just a hint of his profound inner knowledge of Zen.  Yet, having been in the States since 1974, a level of Chang Sik Kim's Americanization can be discerned from the poem: 'One Cup of Water' on page 83, where he is almost cynical!  Perhaps that is a strength as Zen deals with the most advanced technological culture in the 21st century as felt by one of the most 'PURE' Zen Monks in this country.  \\"The Sky Is Blue, The Water Is Clear\\", like the Stone Lion at the Cross Road, informs those who view it, in the most simplest of terms, an endless Zen lesson.	2002-05-16

This is a good book which illuminates what 'Shim Gum Do' is all about.  It seems to be a standard exposition of Zen Buddhist views and values coupled with an interesting story of how Zen Master Chang Sik Kim was inspired through meditation in discovering his 'Art of Zen Sword'.  Zen Master Chang Sik Kim is a former member of the Korean Buddhist 'Chogye' clergy, a celebant order, but obviously the founding master has modified that practice in Shim Gum Do as his book includes photographs of his wife and children.  This book shows that the founding master is a serious, dedicated, and qualified Zen monk and his martial training is used as a form of dynamic meditation to complement sitting meditation, done from the excellent Korean point of view.  Americans forget that fighting Buddhist monks are priests first, warriors last. And that the karate/kung fu/ho shin sul training conforms with the Zen precepts of cultivating a 'focused' mind and developing a strong sense of character and self-reliance. Zen Master Chang Sik Kim's book: The Art of Zen Sword, deftly draws out this message with photographs, drawings, ko-ang (koan)examples, philosophy, and fascinating anecdotal information from past Korean Zen masters.  In Korea Zen is referred to as 'Son'.  Master Chang Sik Kim also emphasized that humble work such as cooking and cleaning are equally important in the human development as the sword training, and that was impressive!  After reading his book several times, I believe Shim Gum Do has a healthy future in the United States and Zen Master Chang Sik Kim should be congratulated for bringing his discovery to these shores.	2002-05-12
