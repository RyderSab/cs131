Through a web of corporate holdings, he creates a scenario in which seemingly benign mergers mean that a single corporation can delve into every aspect of a person's life. The scope of the Big Brother operations is slowly revealed almost as a second story line in a fast-paced cloak and dagger tale about a deep-cover spy.

Good plot and pacing, with well-developed characters makes for an entertaing read. My only complaint is that there were too many loose ends and unanswered questions in the story (but that kind of story device seems to be so in vogue these days).	2000-09-29

You'll be thinking about the intricate plot twists of this story after you read the last page. As someone always on the lookout for new authors, I must say that Fergusson has written an interesting page-turner, and has laid the foundation for a successful writing career.	2000-09-29

He is brought to justice by a cop whose wife was the killer's last victim. Years later, a copy-cat killer brings the cop back into the hunt. Lots of scientific info packed into this suspense-thriller, with gruesome descriptions of crime scenes. Impressive debut novel from Levy.	2000-09-23

Ex-MP Reacher, although he was blackmailed by the FBI into taking the job, finds that his hunt for the vicious serial killer of young women who were at one time enlisted in the US Army, is a job he is more than qualified to undertake.

Into this tangled web enters Mutt, a contract killer, who is among the most memorable characters in the book.

Wolfe  has populated a world with memorable characters (Cap'm Charlie Croker &amp;  his trophy wife, Serena, Conrad, Roger Too White, Ray Peepgass and so many  others), that will live on in the reader's memory. Turpmtine Plantation  feels like a very real place. Then, with the suddenness of a car wreck, the  story lurches to an awkward and disappointing conclusion.
