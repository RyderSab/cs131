Blame is perhaps the most useless of all words in the human vocabulary, and it is the most useless of all emotions. If you get mad, know you are dealing with yourself and the person you are mad at has provided the excuse  for you to get mad. And you get mad because you are afraid. If you are not  afraid, there is no way you will get mad at someone. If you are not afraid,  there is no way you can blame someone else for making you mad or  uncomfortable. If you live without fear, if you love, there is no place for  those emotions. There is no place for blame. When you feel good about  yourself, everything around you is good. You love everything that is around  you, because you love yourself. If you are truthful to yourself, you will  save yourself a lot of emotional pain. You are never responsible for the  actions of others, you are only responsible for you.	2000-05-11
