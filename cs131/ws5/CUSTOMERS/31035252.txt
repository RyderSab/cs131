US	31035252	RXKA880URE4DT	0871139111	474618201	Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A WORTHY READ!	This has got to be one of the best books I have read in awhile. The author doesnt dwell on the &quot;big picture&quot; or tries to push a political agenda, he just focuses on the soldiers on the ground doing their jobs. This book grabs you from the very beginning and doesnt let you go. He puts you right in the tank/Bradley turrets, M113s and in the bunkers of the enemy. You can feel every RPG hit or bullet pinging off the turrets. He does not bore you with numerous names and the story is easy to follow. Whenever he uses a military term, he is quick to explain it so you as the reader isn't left wondering what a GPS is and trying to leaf through the back of the book to a glossary. The book is very well written and an asset to anybody's military library.<br />What I found very interesting is the level of detail the author presented about the incident when an M1 Abrams round killed some journalist in the Palestine Hotel. The news reported that incident like the US Army was some rogue element shooting up buildings indiscrimanetly. That is total false. The author shows how the soldiers, who were getting shot at, tried their best to verify the location of the hotel before firing. All the angst from the international community over the incident was overblown and just proves that journalist will manipulate the facts to serve their own needs. The whole incident boiled down to soldiers doing their job and trying to keep their people safe. If a bunch of journalist who didnt even HAVE to be in Baghdad didn't like the way things turned out, then oh well. At least this book shows what really happened. This book is worth every penny.	2004-06-21

It is another engrossing read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The two biggest drawbacks was the price (way to expensive for a soft cover) and the ending. I wont give it away, but it semed as if the author was more interested in ending the book quickly then writing more. Overall the book was good, but not worth the price.	2004-06-14

The story flows well and it is obvious the author knows her tactics and military terminolgy. The story is engrossing and kept my interest. The biggest turn off is the price. The book is not a hardcover yet it is very expensive. It is way too pricey for a soft cover.	2004-06-14

The author has written a well balanced account of life as a black tanker during World War II. He goes into detail showing the differences in their training compared to white soldiers and the racism they encountered. For all the humiliation they suffered in the USA, they didn't let it get them down and soldiered on when called to fight. The battle accounts are detailed and the focus is in the soldiers and not the equipment. The only &quot;flaw&quot; in the book is it does not have any maps. It was kind of hard following the route of the 761st as they fought through Europe. Some of the towns I have heard of and others I didnt have a clue. Maps would have helped. But overall this book is an easy read and easy to understand and a well written account of the 761st Tank Battalion.	2004-05-25

The author gives a fresh perspective of the fighting on the Eastern Front during WWII. The author was an infantry officer who &quot;specialized' in riding on tanks into battle. He provides very detailed accounts of tank/infantry cooperation during urban battles (relevant if you are a soldier on the way to Iraq) and dispels the myth that the Soviet Army was a faceless mass that just steamrolled over the German Army. He changes the &quot;face-less mass&quot; belief. He shows the human side of the Soviet soldier and his many tales of life with his comrades shows they were not communist robots, but humans who loved, mourned and lost. Overall this book is worth every penny and worth reading. I highly recommend it.	2004-04-30

Mr. Atkinson writes in detail about the deployment and combat the 101st Airborne Division was involved in during Operation Iraqi Freedom. A majority of the book is focused on the commanding general and his staff, but the author does write about those at the lower levels of command and the problems they faced. His writing is very detailed and makes the reader feel as if he is actually getting pounded with sand during shamals or seeing comrades die during combat. The writing draws you in and keeps you there. Mr. Atkinson is brutally honest in showing how politician's views and soldier's views of how the war should have been waged are vastly different. Mr. Atkinson is not complimentary toward Bush and Rumsfeld. He writes about their trying to go to war &quot;on a shoestring&quot; and how they got upset when the V Corps commander stated his opinion of how the war was going. Recent events in Iraq has proven once again that politicians who weasled their way out of serving their country do not have a clue what it takes to wage and win a war.	2004-04-12

This book is a very interesting read and provides a grunt eye view of Desert Storm from the turret of a Marine Tank. Most of the book deals with deployment and training. When the ground war finally starts you feel as if you are riding in the turret with the author. He does not bore you with tons of names or tries to show you how clever he is by using all kinds of technical jargon. The writing is concise and even if you do not have any knowledge of Marine Corps Armor Operations you can still read this book and enjoy it.	2004-02-16

Every few years a book comes along that is truly impressive and this book is one of them. The author has written an excellent account of an armored division at war. It is very easy to read and understand and he is very descriptive of the battles and movement of the 4th Armored Division. The author talks about the big picture to help the reader understand why the division attacked in certain directions. He also peppers each chapter with small unit actions that conveys the terror and triumphs the men of the division experienced. The chapter on the relief of General Wood was well written and thought out. The author avoids trying to lay blame at one person's feet, but tries to show how certain factors (from COL Withers incompent handling of CCA to Wood's arguments with his corps commander, Eddy) may have lead to Wood's dismissal from command of his beloved division. The only &quot;flaw&quot; if you can call it that is at the beginning of each section he includes a map of the area of operations the chapter is describing. What would have been helpful would have been if the author showed the routes of CCA, CCB and CCR along with what units were on the flanks. It would have helped follow the action a little better. Nonetheless this book is worth every penny and If the author decides to write another book on &quot;Patton's Best&quot; I will be first in line to buy it.	2004-02-16

The authors have written an objective book about what went on over in Iraq from March 2003 to April 2003. It is an engrossing read and worth every penny. The one glaring error in the whole book is when the authors are writing about Desert Storm. They write that LTG Fred Franks commanded V Corps in Germany and Desert Storm. This is wrong. LTG Fred Franks commanded VII Corps in Germany and Desert Storm. Other than that this book is well written and worth every penny.	2004-01-25

It deals mostly with naval actions and hardly any ground combat. I did not find this book enjoyable because I am not interested in naval warfare. The picture of the M1 tank on the front cover should be replaced with a ship since this is what this bookis mostly about. If you are a naval fan then this is the book for you. If you are a ground pounder, like me, then skip it or check it out at your local library.	2004-01-13

This book outlines a possible scenario involving China attacking Taiwan. The battle sequences are breathtaking and makes you feel as if you are actually taking part in the battles. The characters are interesting and it is easy to follow who is doing what. There are a few typographical errors, but not enough to be distracting. About the worse part of the book is it is obvious written by two right-wing Clinton haters. The president in the book is never named, but it is obvious he is Clinton from all the snide remarks throughout the book about the president's personal life and lack of military experience. Also the authors make it painfully obvious that the reason the Chinese were able to field such a strong military is because of all the nuclear secrets they &quot;stole&quot; from the (Clinton) Adminstation and how our supposed &quot;friends&quot; in other countries gave them technology they used against us. There are two unbelievable parts of the book. One is when the Chinese launch a dummy missle at California and millions start to mass evacuate from the cities on the West Coast. Sept 11 proved most Americans arent cowards who will hightail out of there home just because of a threat. The second part is the USA losing its gonads and not doing nothing to stop Communist Chinese aggression in Asia. If China did attack Taiwan during the Clinton Admin I highly doubt he would have sat on his hands and acted like a chicken like the president did in the book. Overall this is a pretty good book and worth the money.	2004-01-12

I just finished reading this book and I was very impressed with it. The authors are all accomplished military commanders and it shows in their writing and analysis of the topics they chose. What makes this book interesting is it is not a boring repeat of historical facts that can be found in any military history book. The different authors mix the &quot;big picture&quot; with many little pictures. They show the grunt's eye view of warfare and how they coped with being outnumbered and outgunned. Many unknown facts are peppered throughout the book such as the commander of the British forces heading to Gallipoli wore pajamas on the bridge of his ship and was equipped with only an old travel map of Turkey. Another author writes about one Israeli lieutenant took two tanks and held of masses of Syrian armor on the Golan heights even though he was wounded. About the only &quot;flaw&quot; in the book is there are very few maps in which to follow the action. Some maps are included, but they are not very helpful. Overall this book is outstanding and you will not waste your money by buying it.	2004-01-07

This book is about a cav scout fighting in a fictious war in the future. Half the time I was reading it I was wondering just what was going on. It seemed all this guy did was ride around sand dunes and complain. The &quot;big picture&quot; is not developed. After reading the book I still dont have a clue as to why we were fighting and whom. Then there is the &quot;UFO&quot; part of the book. I wont give it away, but that part of the book was totally odd. This book could have been so much more. The author could have still used a fictious scenario, but beefed it up more and made it more believable.	2003-12-31

Tack Always having to serve his time in purgatory (the NTC) is an outstanding read. Having served 12 years in the Army as an Armor officer I found this book dead on about tactics and operational planning.

Most military fiction books are set in Europe or the Middle East, very few are set in Korea. COL Antal has woven a great story with interesting characters into an outstanding read.

This book opened my eyes to the daily hardships suffered by the soldiers and marines who served in that &quot;police action&quot;. Mr. Gilbert has written a fascinating book that details small unit armored action in Korea. He doesnt overwhelm you with tons of names you have to remember and most of the book is told in the veteran's own words with Mr. Gilbert adding the &quot;bigger picture&quot; so the reader can fully understand what is happening. There are few maps in the book, but they are extremely helpful when it comes to understanding where the armored units operated at. Overall a very well written book.

I was really looking forward to this book and I finally got it and read it and wasn't too impressed by it. In a nutshell, the book is dull. It seems as if the author just focuses on a few of the independent tank battalions that served in WWII and ignores the rest. The biggest disappointment in this book is there are no maps in it. It is hard trying to follow the flow of the action and not have a clue where some of these locations were that the author was talking about. About the only good thing about this book is the author lists the history of each of the independent tank battalions at the end of the book. If you have some extra cash laying around then buy this book. If you are on a strict budget, get it at the library.	2003-12-15

It started out pretty interesting, but after the writer got to Europe it devolved into, &quot;we drove and drove some more.&quot; There is very little details about any of the battles this unit was involved in, it pretty much deals with the author and his unit driving until the end of the war. I understand he was a &quot;tank driver&quot; although he did command a few tanks during a few times during the war, but it would have been a better book if he had provided more details of the battles his company had.	2003-12-05

It is a good book and accurately depicts what life was like for us overthere. It shows Desert Storm was not some slick footage that civilians saw on television every night, but real soldiers doing real killing in face to face combat. My only problem with this book is the character's angst became boring after awhile. He obviously needed some help but everybody who offered a chance for this guy to unburden on, he hurt or turned away in some manner or another. Overall this book is well written and clearly shows the pain soldiers face after surviving battle.	2003-12-01

I was anxiously awaiting a good book that detailed our latest war in Iraq and I was not disappointed. This book is OUTSTANDING! West and Smith managed to write a book that not only shows you the big picture, but all the little smaller pictures too. They don't overload you with names and their description of the fighting makes you feel as if you are there. The most impressive thing about this book is they don't try to paint a &quot;US Military is always right&quot; picture in this book. They write openly about what some might consider murder of innocent civilians by Marines yet they balance it with the compassion Marines showed to innocent Iraqis caught in the cross fire. Overall this book is well worth every penny and I a glad I purchased it.	2003-09-29

It is an anthology of various books written by Mr. Malensek and once I started reading it, I couldnt put it down.<br />The war (or I should say wars) takes place between 2010 - 2011. Most of the story is told by diary entries or news releases, with some narrative in between. I served in the military 12 years and I can honestly say the author knows what he is talking about and I like how he doesn't include some gee-whiz high tech gadgets that a person in this year can't visualize. He has the various soldiers using equipment that is in use today (with the exception of the aresenal ships).<br />My only real complaint with the book is it seems as if nobody proof read it after it was completed. There are numerous grammtical errors. The biggest complaint is the dates of some of the events do not match up. Example: The author writes how on Jan 31, 2011 the news reports that two US aircraft carriers were sunck off the coast of North Korea, but on the next page one of the characters is writing about the battle and stated it happened that day, the day he is writing his entry is Feb 3, 2011. Also there is a section of the book where the dates are totally messed up.<br />Overall this is a well written and excellent story and it was worth every penny.	2003-07-21

Some of the scenarios were entertaining and kept my interest while others were just plain boring. The scenario involving an Afghanistan-Soviet-Pakistan-India war was downright boring and uninteresting to read. The last scenario dealing with a NATO attack on the collapsing Soviet Empire was ridiculous. I found it hard to believe that by firing bottles of vodka at attacking Russian troops would have eventually defeated them. Overall it was an okay read, but nothing to get excited about.	2003-07-04

I was a M1 tank platoon leader in Desert Storm so I was a little skeptical when I found out the author of this book was just an &quot;Intell weenie&quot;. Well I was surprised at how well written this book was and how knowledgeable the author was on tank operations.<br />This book was totally OUTSTANDING! He does not bore the reader with endless speeches about how right or wrong the war was or trying to explain every facet of training and deployment. He writes just enough about the life of this battalion before, during and after the war to keep your interest.<br />His writing style is easy to read and understand and the few maps included in the book were easy to follow and added to my understanding of what was taking place.<br />I always wondered about the battle against the Iraqi Republican Guards divisions that took place in March and now I know. The author portrays a vivid picture of what went on and shows that it was more than just an &quot;incident&quot; like the news portrayed it.<br />This book was worth the wait and the money I paid for it!	2003-07-04

Sword Point is a great book if you are interested in what a war between the US and the USSR would be like. The only flaw I sound in the book is the supply problem the Russians ran into. I can't imagine the Soviets really running out of gas, especially when their supply lines are far shorters than the Americans. Other than that small item, this book is great. I highly recommend it.	2003-06-09

For a non-military person this book offers a unique insight into what it is like for a unit going off to war. there are flaws though, as mentioned by others it is hard at times to figure out who is doing the talking. One minute I'm reading about the scout platoon leader and the next I am reading about one of the tank platoon leaders without knowing I had left the scout platoon leader. Overall it is a pretty good book once you get past the confusion of who you are reading about on some pages.	2003-06-05

I am a big Star Trek fan and have been waiting for this novel and it has been a big letdown. It is supposed to take place after the Voyager episode, &quot;Endgame&quot;. One of my biggest pet peeves is when the author said it took Voyager a week to reach Earth. In the last episode Voyager emerged very near earth and there is no way it would have taken it a week to reach it. After that part the book kept going down hill. Starfleet acted as if it was no big deal that they returned, and didnt particularly seem interested in 7 of 9 or the Doctor. Overall it could have been far better written.	2003-06-05

This book was a very good book and I was surprised at some of the similarities the Marines had with the Army. The author did a great job, in my opinion, in showing how a company size element operated during wartime. My only complaint is I wish he had included more diagrams depicting various company actions, especially around OP 4 and OP 6. That part kind of got confusing at times trying to figure out where each company in the 1st LAI was located. Overall this is a great book and small unit leaders in the Army would benefit from this book, even though it is about the Marines.	2003-06-04
