While her work is often well-researched, she is not writing journalism exactly, nor is she writing analysis--though she's unafraid of pulling a quotation from Nick Carraway, Huck, or the Corleones into any discussion--nor, despite the strong presence of her own voice, is she writing a pure \\"personal essay.\\"  Her most successful work defies categorization simply by using whatever comes in handy at the moment.  The subtitle \\"Stories form the New World\\" suggests the loose theme of these essays, the bred-in-the-bones idealism of this country that any sensible person resists and feels nonetheless.  Besides being someone worth spending time with, Sarah Vowell creates prose like clear, cool water.  She speaks through words, not into them, and that is a too-rare phenomenon among essayists.	2005-09-17

In 1993-94, Ruhlman returned to his alma mater, University School in Cleveland, to explore the workings of an all-boys school and study its headmaster, the famously idiosyncratic Rick Hawley.  In this context, I'd be hard-pressed to outline all my issues with Ruhlman's project, but his \\"fly on the wall\\" presentation of teachers and classes is consistently evocative--real, familiar, and true to the private school life I experience as a private school teacher.  However, Ruhlman stumbles as he explains. When he tries to make something of his observations--to comment on what's distinctive about boys schools or what Rick Hawley represents or what anything adds-up to--he teeters on rationalization.  If, as he says in the book, Ruhlman wanted his readers to \\"fulfill\\" the \\"dramas\\" he presented, he should have let them.  Better yet, he might have left this task to someone who was not an alum of the school.	2005-09-17

However interest in The Glass Bees (originally published in 1957) is more a credit to the book's prescience than its extraordinarily long-lived author. In the novel, the head of a multinational animation studio develops a new variety of movies using lifelike automatons indistinguishable from real actors. The glass bees of the title are his newest gizmos, as small as bees yet outperforming what they mimic, recreating and specializing themselves until their evolution races past their creators' control. More a meditation than a novel, this work airs the views of its narrator, a former cavalry officer obsessed with the ravages of modernity, specifically the way it makes our lives easier and more unpleasant. More ease, the old soldier says, has made us more prone to complain instead of less. While it's impossible to outline all the ideas in the officer's heady ruminations, they have a common theme: he was better off when his work was real.	2005-09-17

An obsessive compulsive who fears nothing more than curbs, Daniel nudges the narrative with his odd hopes and transparently grandiose expectations. He maintains, throughout, a gentle voice that never rises above a whisper. To call this novel \\"whimsical\\" is to finish it with one word, but Martin has an odd style that begs that one word. Nothing in Daniel's mode of expression conveys his malady--that approach seems a step too artistically virtuous for Martin--and, other than Daniel's quirks, he seems flat, in every way average. Things happen in this book--interesting and funny and creative things--but none of them attains the urgency to which a hungry writer might aspire. To offer faint praise, this novel was quite diverting. However, Martin composes like writing is his hobby.  Though a reader might smile or feel warm at moments, the overall effect of this novel is so muted it sometimes seems half-hearted.	2005-09-17

If you have it, you have sway. Without it, you can be quietly skillful and have sand kicked in your face all day. As many memoirs demonstrate, however, you can be both experienced and artful. I won't mince words--Augusten Burrough's prose seems artless, the sort of this-then-that writing that, with a different subject matter, might go entirely unnoticed. His description of sex with his pedophile lover or, his mother's lover's early abuse on a rowboat creates more shock than substance. Strange, amazing, peculiar, and--yes, I admit it--funny stuff mixes with quotidian detail, but the shock wears off long before the book ends. True, nature abhors a vacuum and so do readers. They fill in the blanks of flat and unaffected descriptions, and unemotional accounts of appalling events surpass events hyped as dramatic. However, the effect of Running With Scissors--to be fair, it appears the intended effect--is to kill the reader's nerve endings. In that goal, it succeeds too well, allowing readers sufficient dispassion to notice just how banal this writing can be.	2005-09-17

Even when his work is entirely predictable--as this novel was--I wonder if he meant for it to be so and if the joke is really on me for thinking I've made a discovery the author intended to be patently obvious. Chesterton can be tongue in cheek about being tongue in cheek. His tone is a a series of nested Chinese boxes; it defies me. The author professes to be shocked at each unveiling in this novel. Yet, by the time the third figure is unveiled in similar fashion, a reader might begin to wonder--could Chesterton have been serious when he has the narrator express shock? I wasn't shocked.  I thought, \\"Should I be shocked that Chesterton is so unshocking?\\" You can't win when the writer seems so much more clever than you are.	2005-09-17

Yet contemporary writers might emulate his devastating calm more often. Camus' only religion is the elemental--light, heat, effort, and movement--and in those basics he saw all he needed to create a story...because we are all makings of the sun. Just before the murder at the core of the novel, and the narrator's asserts that \\"To stay, or to make a move--it came to much the same\\" sets the scene for the senseless act three pages later. This moment, however, is no mere \\"telling\\"; it succinctly describes the emotional inertia, exhaustion of will, and nausea to which humans fall prey. Knowing how it really feels to have meaning drop away, he knows any more elaborate description would seem false. What is more, he says just enough to make the murder both understandable and baffling. Camus' triumph--not just as a philosopher but also as a writer--is telling his tale and feeling its truth.	2005-09-17

The same might be said of McEwan's mastery of syntax and human nature. Vernon Halliday's internal monologues cut against the way we see he really is. While Vernon feels great about publishing some compromising photos of foreign secretary Julian Garmony, his hubris is palpable and laughable. His dreams of changing the world are patently excessive. Nowhere does McEwan need to say Vernon is riding for a fall--or that his parallel main character, Clive Linley, is doing the same. The enthusiasm of the prose allows us to so clearly recognize what they do not: the grander the vision, the more likely the delusion. Beside the two main characters, McEwan places Molly Lane, the former lover Vernon and Clive share. Her messy bedroom and messy affairs remind us of the natural form people take when they are less impressed with themselves.	2005-09-17

The book is an odd combination of fantasy and reality, detailed in its attention to contents of a survival kit and the floating mass of manna/seaweed that proves parasitic of its meerkat (and human) inhabitants. For the most part, Martel balances real and fantastic well, suspending disbelief confidently by just assuming it...until Japanese investigators seek to know \\"what happened.\\"  I almost cried when, in the face of the investigator's objections, Pi retells his tale \\"without the animals,\\" undoing what the book worked so well to achieve and making the novel into an explicit allegory.

That is David Sedaris. So busy is he relaying the experiences of Lisa, Amy, Gretchen, Tiffany, and Paul \\"Rooster\\" Sedaris--all of whom we now know well--he has little to offer from his own life. And most of his own present day stories are anaemic in comparison to accounts of his family and upbringing. The secret of Sedaris' work has always been its odd mixture of humor, discomfort, and pathos. In this collection, the pathos often arises from Sedaris' method, the way he undermines his life to build his accounts of it. In a brilliant passage, he trains his sister Lisa's parrot to beg forgiveness for taking her stories. In this book, he begs us to forgive him as well, repeating--as a parrot does, as a person training a parrot does--the tried and true method he's used before to make us laugh, cringe, and cry. As much as I admire David Sedaris (and I do admire him immensely) I can't help hoping he finds a new vein. His talent is too great to waste on self-imitation, and that seems to be the direction he's heading.	2005-09-17

Stewart imagines Galveston after a storm of magic overtakes the island.  \\"Prawn men\\" wander the jetties with fleshy mustaches hanging over and under their lips, hearts are squeezed into dolls that then take on life, and century old ghosts hold office and lead people around with their icy touch.  Magic demands no credibility because it is firmly beyond question.  Magical realism, in contrast, has never been that real or that commonplace.  And, to me, what works imaginatively doesn't work literally.  Magical realism swims between the metaphoric and the actual and a reader cannot know which it is.  The world is bathed in surreal light.  Stewart's world, in comparison, seems costumed, the end of a \\"what if\\" story.

Shepherd, however, has the worst debriefing habit I've ever seen.  Characters often discuss a scene that has just passed before readers' eyes, gambling that what the character says will align with what the reader feels.  In this novel, people often say how much they were moved.  What happens, however, if the reader wasn't, or, worse, if the scene before left the reader flat?  In Shepherd's novel, we are supposed to believe in Henry's transformation.  Through righting a list of wrongs, Henry \\"The Assassin\\" Chase is supposed to rediscover the idealist he once was.  It's a fun premise, but for me the \\"supposed to\\" was its most vivid element.

Not all the adolescents are confused and conflicted, but they share a changing sense of what \\"normal\\" adolescence is. For a couple, drugs are a normal and expected aspect of being an adolescent, something they simply do. Hersch's strength is that she largely lets her subjects speak for themselves, free from her judgment or censure. This \\"She says...She thinks...\\" approach can become tiresome, but more often it reveals. Statistics and the voices of adults help add perspective to Hersch's account, but, even then, it is not Hersch herself who is speaking. The general effect is to evoke the world of adolescence while recognizing its broader context. A reader feels empathy for all of Hersch's teens because she presents them as innocents, unaware of their own contradictions and their manipulation by forces around them. The book is more horrifying because we like these kids who do these horrifying things.	2005-09-17

Like the ring that gives Mingus flight, he is the magical streak in the otherwise painfully realistic coming of age of Dylan Edbus in 70's and 80's Brooklyn. Mingus' life story, like his father's before him, is superficially about every chance wasted. However, Mingus' peculiar innocence, his \\"unhesitation,\\" illuminates the muted failure of his friend Dylan to take any serious chance or to stand up for himself. Dylan can only wield the ring if no one is watching, his flights barely distinguishable from good jumping. Lenthem pulls off a coup by making readers love Mingus despite his relentless dissolution and disintegration. When Dylan decides to rescue Mingus from prison--I won't reveal how--it makes perfect sense. We feel for Dylan, but Mingus, Dylan knows and we know, was always the special one.	2005-09-17

Some superficial elements of the one state of We reappear in the novels, but the trail Zamyatin blazes is really technical, not substantial.  We's most vivid element--maybe the most vivid element of any utopia--is its insistence on one half of a human paradox.  It makes sense mathematically that reducing freedom to zero will eliminate criminality, but real life arises from the uneasy reconciliation of contradictory, equally viable truths (see: \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder\\" / \\"Out of sight, out of mind\\").  As a half-wit who believes only half of what we are, Zamyatin's narrator consistently misses the point.  Any attempt to suppress an element of humanity is just as likely to inflame it.

See the cover.  The central character, the Little Fool, is a diver with the New York police who becomes too involved in the case when he retrieves a former lover from the East River. That premise might be enough to launch the story, but the voice of Dickie offers prismatic commentary that slices and dices the implications of every event--and non-event--until what actually happened becomes relatively unimportant and certainly much more complicated than need be. The story IS odd, a challenge to a readers' sensibilities, but its deconstruction at the hands of Dickie is odder, especially when you add in ample pop allusion and ironic banter. A reader who might be troubled by the story--I was--is doubly troubled by the sock doll's reading of appalling events as \\"sexy.\\" If you agree \\"creepy is sexy, \\" perhaps you can transcend the gimmick of this book and identify with Dickie, but if you can't, the narrative becomes a sort of mudfest, churning a churning until events are as murky as the river where the Little Fool dives. I wondered whether the story was ultimately an excuse to speak. And as good as the speech sometimes was, I often felt more awe than empathy.	2005-09-17

Perhaps it makes sense that, as with any other instrument, the artistry lies in the spirit of the artist, not in any tool he or she wields. Still, it is baffling to see the broken voices of Juvenile Hall speak so eloquently. At first many of the authors in this book did not want to participate in Salzman's class. Yet each has a \\"forbidden child\\" hidden amid anger, rejection, and remorse, a voice that Salzman, sensibly, offers with little intrusion. Salzman's account of his year teaching at Central is a love letter. Many of the pieces are rife with sliding logic and mixed metaphor. Yet the immediacy of the writing is more impressive because of those \\"mistakes,\\" communicating that ultimately virtuous writing rests on having something to say and a desperate desire to say it. And nothing is as desperate as the hope of the boys who speak in voices as tragic as they are raw.	2005-09-17

They share not only aloof prose, post-modern juxtaposition, and comically baroque detail, but also the same sense of order just below the surface of ordinary life.  In Lullaby, that order is embodied in \\"a culling song,\\" a rhyme that--when read from a children's book, recited, or even thought--kills the listener.  Behind that central premise is another--if something like this can exist, where does it come from and what sort of world are we really living in?  \\"Paranoia\\" is the simple term for that feeling, but it's bigger than that.

Three years later, I just got around to it.  If you believe his aesthetic, that poems create themselves and put the conscious and unconscious in one room and let them duke it out, Dobyns is not your man.  He speaks against \\"earnestness\\" and likes nothing more than a poem that uses humor to blunt seriousness and throw readers off kilter.  At the same time, Dobyns believes a poem should be beholden to no one, that poetry cannot, must not, \\"play nice.\\"  Those two perspectives do not always meld well.  It is tough to be sincerely hard-hitting without earnestness AND evoke a chuckle or two along the way.  In one poem in this collection, \\"Artistic Matters,\\" Dobyns means to locate a scary monster in each of us.  \\"There is nothing he loves,\\" he tells us, and blames the monster for murder and mayhem.  Yet Dobyn's monster seems well under control--not just in Dobyn's witty and neatly even lines--but in the \\"artistic matters\\" that he wears like so many layers of silk.  I've come to the conclusion that it may be unfair to judge Dobyns by his impossible and theoretical standards.  The poems WERE nice--clever and gently revelatory--and that may be enough--but this collection left me wishing he weren't periodically compelled to trot phony monsters out.	2005-09-13

Subtitled \\"A Novel in Two Semesters,\\" The Cheese Monkeys follows an art student and his classmates through his first year.  Dropped in the fifties, the novel flies from one iconoclastic act to another.  Along the way, Kidd conceives some surprising and clever scenes: the second semester design professor drops them on a winter highway with the materials to create a sign that will get them home; the narrator takes some very interesting photographs of the professor to fulfill a project.  However, the novel's organization of experience as assignments suggests fiction driven by design as much as by narrative.  It feels assembled.  One way of thinking about fiction is \\"Wouldn't it be cool if...\\" but this novel made me wonder.  Can fiction arise solely from the impulse to create unlikely scenarios?  In my college days, a roommate and I used to give \\"The McTeague Award,\\"--an imaginary honor named after Frank Norris' novel--to any book that could get a character into an unbelievably bizarre situation.

The central character of the novel, White Mike, is a drug dealer who put off Dartmouth to ply his lucrative trade.  Yet, Mike needs neither the money nor the goods and seems bereft of any powerful feeling or motive at all.  \\"You have seen that before you lies a great stretch of road,\\" White Mike says, \\"it is windswept or blasted by the hot sun or covered in snow, or it is dirt or concrete or shrouded in darkness or bright and clear so you have to squint, but no matter what, it is utterly empty.\\"  White Mike drifts through Manhattan, seeing to prep school clients who are home for holiday breaks and who all seem similarly busy but numb.  There is a murder, but for most of the novel it is only an event stacked beside the others.  The \\"firsts\\" of many of the teenaged characters seem deep in their pasts, as arbitrary and \\"existential\\" as every other first you've forgotten.  Adults, of course, are absent and/or irrelevant.  McDonell is a talented writer who has a gift for observation, concision, understatement and juxtaposition, but the \\"coolness\\" of his debut can be off-putting.  It's alternately eerie and callow.  When it comes time to express uncool emotions, the novel rings false, like Holden Caulfield on zoloft.  Sometimes the novel's silent desperation seems as affected as its characters.	2005-09-13

The little Edumundson knows about Lears becomes the excuse for this high school memoir, and, over thirty years down the line, Edmundson speculates endlessly about what Lears was doing or thinking.  Edmundson acknowledges a second type of teachers, \\"truthtellers,\\" or \\"human incandescensces\\" who \\"burn brilliantly and they are always, always right.\\"  However, it is clear that this memoir would not exist (or that it would purely be Edmundson's senior year of football and fights with his father) if not for the cipher Frank Lears.  In the end, I wondered if Lears were real or a retro-ideal of Edmundson's imagination.  So much of this memoir seemed filmed through cheesecloth.  Edmundson, who I have always admired for asking hard questions, becomes uncharacteristically sentimental.  The truth is that no teacher can be exclusively an ironist or a truthteller; the best teachers simply make good guesses about when to play which role with whom.  What is more important, teachers are human, which--I'm sorry to say--Frank Lears is not.	2005-09-13

Homemade or homespun, Gray's writing is full of ellipsis, repetition, and those sort of \\"A equals B equals C\\" moments that could easily be cleaned up and cleared up.  However, a good part of its immediacy rises from its seeming in-creation rather than created.  A steady stream of wonder courses through wording that--I'm assuming--was deliberately crafted to be appropriately imperfect.  Maybe I'm prejudiced by having heard Gray and by my grief--which persists--but his unpolished prose throws more crafted work into an odd perspective.  At one moment in this piece, Gray describes how seeing street entertainment on the way to David Copperfield made the master magician appear pure artifice.  For me, that's what Gray does--he shows the joys of real and messy creativity.	2005-09-13

One will make sense to you and surpass \\"reasonable\\" or \\"plausible\\" to attain \\"feeling right.\\"  In a similar sense, I enjoy Franzen's essays most when they elicit instant affirmation.  At those moments, you can nod, say he's hit upon something, notice what nifty way he's found to express what you should have known before.  Surprisingly, he seldom achieves that exalted state when he's speaking personally, for himself.  He seems more effective when he triangulates his own views with contributions from other smart people.  Reading this collection of essays, you occasionally detect the prickliness that makes him--rightly or wrongly--a literary bad boy.  His indignation can veer into stridency.  However, you also see a sort of warmth that, for me, The Corrections sometimes lacked.  As Franzen suggests in his essay \\"Why Bother?,\\" I read for confirmation that life is complicated.  At its best, How to Be Alone does so in a way that suggests not just solidarity with Franzen--and with those he quotes--but with what Franzen observes.	2005-09-13

Lombardo portrays Petey with tenderness and understanding without ever sentimentalizing or idealizing him.  In other hands, Petey's evolution might have led to disillusionment, but Lombardo brilliantly captures Petey's internal voice, a voice that never loses its wonder even as he learns the codes of Bridgeport, his tough neighborhood.  Lombardo's collection defies the flat characterization of masculinity too common in contemporary popular culture.  Petey, his father, and even the punks of Bridgeport are three dimensional, outwardly posturing but inwardly real, devoted to the toughness expected of them while holding within extraordinary loyalty, affection, courage, and their own brand of honor.	2005-08-30
