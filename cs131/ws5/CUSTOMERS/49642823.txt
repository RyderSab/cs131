I took this book out of the library hoping for a little more on his personal life.  I wasn't too disappointed, but I would prefer if he had mentioned more about his family.  There was a lot about his skating in it, though, which is what I love about him.  He talks a lot about Calgary, which can get annoying because it happened almost 13 years ago!  Don't get me wrong--I loved reading about it, but I've already read a lot about it.  My favorite part was the tour scrapbook.  That was neat to see.  I also liked very much that people wrote their own commentary on Brian and about different things.  You can read this book for an enjoyable read, but don't expect too much on skating.	2001-02-01

But Rizka cleverly outwits him every time.<br />Rizka only  stays in this town where she has hardly a friend because she is waiting for  her gypsy father to return to get her.  Meanwhile, she becomes good friends  with the warm-hearted Big Franko, becomes the sole admirer of Sofiya Pumpa,  the mayor's daughter, and achieves the status of enemy in the Councilor in  Chief Sharpnack's book.<br />You will laugh as Rizka cleverly outsmarts  Sharpnack and slowly wins the townspeoples' trust fairly and squarely.   (She even helps two couples get married!)  I recommend this book very  highly.<br />P.S.  If the person who gave me this book (you know who you are)  reads this, I broadcast &quot;Thank you so, so, so much for this great  book!&quot;	2000-09-07

Wilbur and Mortimer are bored with staying at home and haunting people.  They decide to go to school.  Wilbur joins the third  grade and makes friends with Willy Snodgrass, while Mortimer plays all  sorts of daring tricks. This is a wonderfully funny, exciting, and special  story everyone will enjoy.  It's a great book to read out loud.  I got this  as a gift in the first grade and now that I'm in seventh I still treasure  it as one of my favorite books next to the three Harry Potters.  I  recommend it for anybody.	2000-06-26

In this book, Stacey's friend T.J. is brought to an all-white trial and charged with murdering.  I usually never cry by books, but I cried and cried by this one.  It is so moving and so lifelike.  Mildred D. Taylor writes in  passive and heart-wrenching tones that make this book a real page-turner.   I recommend it highly to anyone, and also be sure to read the prequel, Roll  of Thunder, Hear My Cry, and the third book, The Road To Memphis.	2000-05-28

When I read the caption on the book, I yelled, &quot;Finally!Tobias finds out who his father is!&quot; And he does!  And who itis-that is a really cool secret.  But Tobias is also in a big dilemma. A woman named Aria has shown up and claims to be his cousin.  Should Tobias go and live with her?  But then he discovers the fatal truth. Aria is really Visser 3-which would mean death if the Visser found out who Tobias really was.  But why is Visser 3 pretending to be Tobias's cousin?  Find the answer in this action-packed, exciting book! (Sorry if I sound like a lying magazine, but it really is all that.) K.A., if you read this, I would like to see more romance between Rachel and Tobias!	2000-05-09

I especially liked the idea of opening all the envelopes and reading the letters which were actually written, not a computer-kid-handwriting font.  The point of the chain letters was to tell a big secret to somebody in a letter (no duh) and within 2 days.  I enjoyed  reading all the secrets (especially Dawn's-that was cool) and just the rest  of the letters.  It's a good book.	2000-05-07

I know there is already over a thousand reviews but I just hadto say something.  Harry is back in Hogwarts for his third year andnow there is an escaped prisoner searching for him!  Sirius Black killed 13 people with a single curse and now he is after Harry.  BUT Harry's trouble doesn't end there.  Hermione has recently bought an ugly cat called Crookshanks who is after Ron's pet rat Scabbers.  As Crookshanks continues to chase Scabbers, their friendship is wearing thin. AND that's not all.  Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher, is totally convinced that Harry's life will end very, very soon. I have read this book over 30 times (It's probably more than that but I'm not sure how many times it really is) and I still find it to be a new and intriguing story every time I pick it up, unlike most books that are spoiled once you read them once.  If I could, I would rate this book five gabazillion stars.  J.K., if you read this, I give you TWO THUMBS UP!	2000-05-07

I practically had to get down on my knees to convince myparents to buy me this book.  When they read it, however, theyremarked that this was one of the funniest and well-written books ever written.<br />Gail Carson Levine is one talented author!  This is a modern look on the fairy tale Cinderella.  It really puts it in a new perspective.  Like, it makes the old Cinderella look about as interesting as old clothes.  And it answers all those unanswered questions.  Like, why wasn't Cinderella recognized at the ball? Because it was a masked one!<br />When Ella of Frell is cursed by the fairy Lucinda that she will always be obedient, Ella lives in a danger that she will be ordered to do something that will harm her.  Ella is friends with only her lovable cook Mandy and her mother, lest someone should find out her secret. When her mother dies, Ella meets two utterly repulsive sisters, Hattie and Olive.  Hattie figures out that Ella must obey everyone and makes Ella her personal slave when they go to finishing school together.  However, Ella also makes a more pleasant friend, the Prince Charmont (by the way, Charmont is French for charming! ).  Ella and Charmont meet again when Ella runs away from finishing school, when Ella saves herself from ogres.  But when Ella meets her conniving father, she is devastated to learn that Hattie and Olive will become her stepsisters!  Ella becomes the slave of the two girls and their fat mother.  She correspondes to Char(mont) secretly.  But when Char tells her that he loves her, Ella doesn't know what to do.  If she marries Char, and Hattie (who has a crush on the prince) tells her to divorce him, she will have to obey her.  So Ella pretends she is Hattie and writes that Ella has eloped.  Will Char and Ella get together?  Find out.  Read this excellent book right away!	2000-05-07

Claudia, like any other baby-sitter would be, is scared when she starts getting the impression that Mr. Nichols abuses his kids.  Another reader said that it's the wrong kind of abuse, but I don't think that's true.  My parents never  gave me a black eye when they thought I did something wrong, as Mr. Nichols  does.  Claudia deals with the problem maturely and composedly.  This book  will give you some idea as to how to act in a scary baby-sitting situation.   Read it.	2000-05-07

If you want to know it all about figure skating, well, here's the book for you!  It struck me as sort of gossipy, though.  But there's lots of info that I'd never seen before (and believe me, I read whatever I can about skating) and it REALLY goes into the lives of popular skaters.  A good book  for anyone who wants to be in the know.	2000-05-02

This is definitely THE STUPIDEST book I have ever read about any competitive sport.  Jazzy, the girl Kirk is trying to get to notice him is the most out-of-place character ever created.  Also, there's not as much of swimming as I hoped for, like there is a lot of gymnastics in the American Gold Gymnasts series, or skating in the Silver Blades series (by the way,  they're both excellent series).  Just read it if you're looking for a book.	2000-05-02

When I first took it out from the library, I thought that it would be a stupid story.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  It's really, really good.  Nikki is a wonderful character, and so are Tori, Jill, and Danielle.  As Nikki tries to juggle being popular at her new school, four hours of skating a day,  mastering a double flip and making new friends, readers will laugh and  sympathize with her ups and downs.  A great beginning to a great series.   And it really focuses on skating, and is very clear with the skating lingo.   This book persuaded me to take up figure skating!	2000-04-30

But when another ice dancer threatens to steal Brent from Whitney, she realizes that she doesn't want that to happen.  But will it be too late?  There's not much about skating or ice dancing in this book, only when they fight on the ice.  It's still good, though, and you'll laugh when you read how  Whitney copes with her strange new roommate.  I liked how everything  patched together nicely at the end.
