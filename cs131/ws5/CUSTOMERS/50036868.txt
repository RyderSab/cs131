It is no different than the other books out there, such as \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" or \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\"  In all of these books, the advice is similar: save, don't spend.  Live within your means and invest the rest in bonds, stocks, and real estate.  For the adventurous, some advise starting a business.   <br /> <br />For me, I don't need to be told that I need to spend less than I earn.  That is so obvious I don't understand why I need to pay someone else money to hear that.   <br /> <br />I just don't know how useful some of the advice in this book can be with children.  For example, with respect to my child's education, do I shortchange him now or pay the piper later when he can't fend for himself because he can't do simple algebra?   <br /> <br />To me, I believe it is more important to give a stable family life.  It means living normally but not going overboard on things living within my means.  It's really simple.  If I spend loads of time reading these books that means I have less time for the kids.  I want to send a clear signal that there is nothing more important than family.	2005-03-27

While the book raises the obvious question when did Steve Case and his minions know that the AOL was slowing down, it doesn't offer much in the way of capturing how Time was duped into accepting AOL.  We can blame the AOL folks but a deal requires approval on both ways.  This is not to say that the Time Warner folks were blind or stupid, it's just that in the end, they had to agree to the deal.  Even if AOL did not lie about their numbers, one had to ask whether this was sustainable.<br />That said, it makes it look Time Warner executives have to share some of the blame for being stolen.<br />But if you look at what some AOL execs did to lie and cheat their way into steaing Time, it raises several legal issues.  First, if an acquiring company lies about its performance and cooks its books in order to merge with another company, can the deal be undone due to misrepresentation and fraud?<br />Second, if it can, what is the proper remedy given that the merged company has lost so much value?<br />Third, if it cannot, how should the executives who engaged in the deception be forced to pay?    Obviously proving that they knew they were cooking the books is a difficult proposition.  And if they are froced to pay, should some of that money go to the investors who relied on the false numbers and lost money as a result?<br />These questions go unanswered in the book and are the critical ones that need to be answered.	2003-06-22

Today's women over 30 have more education, earn more money, and are more fun to be with than ever before. The reason it is so hard to find a man is that the good ones have been taken the good ones that are left are too expensive. But for a man, Whitehead argues, it's much easier if they can get the woman to agree to live together. This way, he can have all the benefits of marriage without all the commitment. Once he tires of her, he can dump her and live with another woman. I know this sounds cruel, but this is what is happening and you would be oblivious if you didn't acknowledge that this goes on. <br />While Whitehead offers a great explanation on why all the good men are taken, she doesn't offer any great suggestions on how to overcome it. But since the problem of finding a mate is such a difficult one, I didn't expect her to. <br />This book overall is great. Its scholarly explanation and documentation make it a great read and her writing is easy to follow. I enjoyed it. Hope you do too!	2003-01-03

Probably the most difficult piece to play in public is Chopin Ballade No. 4, and Chopin offers some incredible insight into how he wanted it played.  As you know, the music notation on the sheet cannot cover every intention of the composer, much like writing cannot capture everything, but most of what we want to say.

There are other supplements you can buy that can introduce you to the subject, but no other book comes close to going to the depth that this book does.  It is helpful to have taken a course in Property before reading this book, so that you will have experience in dealing with the Rule Against Perpetuities.  <br /> Ever since G.W. Bush passed the largest tax cut in history, many people think the rich should not be able to endow their children with a large inheritance as it destroys the democratic system we have where everyone has a equal chance at succeeding.  <BR> This book has given me another perspective about the issue of inheritance.  Suppose for a moment we weren't allowed to transfer anything to our children.  If that were to become law, do you really think people would work as hard as they do now, knowing that everything that they have reverts back to the State once they die?   Do we want to take away that incentive to work hard?  <BR> I don't think so.  <br /> Another aspect of this book that I particular enjoy is the way that it is organized.  If you ever wanted to know all the different types of trusts there are, this book covers it.  It also does a good job of introducing you to tax planning during wealth transfers.  <br /> This book also does a good job of making you think.  Do you know what happens when two people who are married die at the same time or when it is unclear which one died first?  It seems insignificant, but suppose A and B, married, both die in a car crash.  A initially willed that everything go to B and C.  B willed everything to go to her children.  If B died first, A's wealth should go to C.  If A died first, B's children and C should get something.  What if it's unclear who died first?  This book deals with that issue and much more.<br /> Another way that it makes you think is that it offers alternative solutions to the same problems.  Did you ever consider other ways the law could be re-written to avoid probate?  Every good lawyer knows the traditional ways of avoiding probate - joint tenancy property, life insurance, Iras, pension plans, and trusts.  But why do not just re-write the law in probate?  What not have universal succession like they do in France?  This book covers all of that.<br /> Did you ever want to know the difference between an administrator and executor?  What happens if the executor drags his feet during the probate process?  What can the beneficiaries do?  This book has the answers.<br /> In sum, this is a great book for learning about Wills & Trusts.   I highly recommend it.	2002-07-27

But don't judge a book by it's cover: if you are interested in kickboxing for fun and self-defense, this is an excellent book as long as you are not interested in doing it professionally. This wonderful book provides the aspiring kickboxer with all the information to get fit and compete: a little history, facts about the sport, training tips, and a great description of the required strikes, kicks, and blocking techniques. But what really makes this book standout is that it has step-by-step instructions for beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts and conditioning drills that put you in shape. If you have an appetite for even more, there book has an additional 8-week program to get you there. Then if that isn't enough, at the end of the book, it provides self-defense techniques with pictures. This is a gem to anyone who has an interest in the sport or just getting in fighting shape.	2002-07-22

In other words, whether the advice of this book really is of anything that you can act on.  For example, if he knew for sure that the stock market was going to go down, why isn't this guy one of the world's richest men?  He should be able to short a stock he is certain will go down, and make a ton of $$$.  <br />With that said, this book was recently published.  Isn't it a little late to be getting out of the market?  I mean for those of us who lost our life savings in 401k or other investment accounts, it's a little bit late.  <br />If it's true the DJIA is going down even more, well selling is not the answer.  If we all sell the market will go down even more.  Kind of makes for a self-fulfilling prophecy in his book?  In order for the DJIA to go below 1000 something would have to fundamentally change in the economy.  We would have to stop consuming anything but the bare utilities, rent, and food.<BR>I don't think the bottom is that low.	2002-07-21

The only downside to Pimsleur is that it doesn't teach you how to write. Other reviews have suggested that Pimsleur is the ONLY way to learn a language. I respectfully disagree. Is it important to know the difference between \\"right\\" and \\"Wright?\\" Is there a difference between \\"there\\" and \\"their?\\" Of course there is. As English speakers, we are well versed in the difference between the similar sounding words. Are there words in Chinese that sound the same but mean something totally different? Sure there are, just like in any other language. But if we were not taught how to write, there is no way we would know. Writing is an important language skill. To be truly successful in learning a foreign language, you need to be able to read, write, listen, read, and speak it. To say that you only need to hear it and speak it is oversimplying the problem of learning a new language.<br />That said, Pimsleur does a great job of teaching you how to speak it and understand it, which for most people, that is all you need to know when you are travelling as a tourist.<br />Again, this is the best oral Chinese language program out there.	2002-06-16

It makes me think I've been duped......<br />It's sort of like starting a sentence, \\"To be honest...,\\" because if you are honest all the time you don't need to preface what you say by starting \\"to be honest.\\"	2002-03-09

Why can't she wait until she is a little older to tell us all?  Many other people have accomplished just as many things as Charlotte and decided to wait until they had more material to write for a book.  I would seriously question the value of reading something like this, since Charlotte refers to &quot;mum&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; so many times it makes you wonder about the literary quality.  A biography is supposed to document one's life but if you are so young, you really haven't lived.  Hence, there is nothing really to document.  And consequently, there is nothing really of interest to read in this book.	2001-07-09

That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good.	2001-06-23

There are no special secrets in this book that makes it worthwhile to buy.<br />Read the documentation that comes with the Visor if you are into knowing every little feature.	2001-06-23
