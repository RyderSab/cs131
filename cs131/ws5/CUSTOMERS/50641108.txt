There are so many New Age &quot;Self-help&quot; books on the shelves that you can literally get lost, and every book begins to sound the same.  This is the first book I've read in a long time that actually helped me.  Of course, I read most of it thinking, &quot;Sure, it worked for the author--her picture on the cover already tells you that she's got everything going for her, but what about the rest of us?&quot;  I also thought her exercises were too simplistic and would not work.  I decided to try the exercise on the bus--meeting your sub-personalities.  I was absolutely not expecting to see any imagery in my mind, since visualizing is difficult for me.  I was  amazed when a very clear&amp; vivid image of a small, plain, mousey-looking woman with glasses stood up immediately on my bus &amp; said hello. I realized that this was the image I have spent my entire life working to avoid, and talking to her was very enlightening.  This book has helped me a great deal in accepting &amp; even embracing all of the aspects of myself that I have worked so hard to eliminate.  I highly recommend it!	2001-10-31

Skeet was also adorable--got a big kick when he waved at the doctor leaving the hospital. Koontz should concentrate on more humor.  He has it in him!	2001-05-21

This book came out during the 70's when I was a teenager and had just gotten my first job (about age 15) waiting tables.  When I received my first pay check, I was absolutely stunned to see the government's &quot;share&quot; for all of &quot;my&quot; grueling labor.  That was my beginning awareness of how &quot;invasive&quot; the government was going to be for all the rest of my life.  I became very distraught and found Harry Browne's book when I was 16.  It has made all the difference in my life.  I applied nearly every principle in this book, and I can say from experience that it works.  I feel that my life has been relatively free, and I thank this wonderful author for showing me how.	2001-04-09

The build up to it almost leads you to believe that he personally destroyed her family.  I also didn't care much for the ending and the person who turned out to be the killer.  It was almost like an afterthought thrown in.  The story seemed to point more towards Alex.  There was also no real motive given for the torture (such as strangling and reviving) if he was only interested in scientific experiments.  He sounded a little too insane to have maintained such a normal appearance for so many years and even become a well respected figure in the town.	2001-02-23

Her  preaching &quot;sounds&quot; good, but her standards of morality are in  complete conflict with our biological reality.  In Biblical times (and even  in our own timespan a hundred years ago), children did not reach puberty  until mid to late teens (which generally corresponded with the age they  married).  Now, with better nutrition and medicine, children generally  enter puberty around the age of 12 or 13.  We live in a society that  encourages education and college, which means that the age of marriage for  most people would be early to mid 20's.  That means that Dr. Laura is  advocating that a person who is sexually mature do absolutely nothing about  it for a period of 9 or 10 years!  When standards of morality conflict with  biological reality, something will eventually &quot;give&quot; and my bet  is on the morality.	2000-09-05

When I first started reading this book, I was a little disappointed.  I  felt the way one reviewer did that the truths were rather simple and  obvious.  However, I noticed that as I read a few pages each day, my  attitude started changing.  I started feeling less annoyed with people I am  always annoyed with and felt less of a need to fight the battles that I  always feel a need to fight.  It really made me consider that somebody  else's truth is not my truth, and there is no need to take it personally or  become angry about it.  Even though these truths are somewhat obvious, we  seldom actually make them a reality in our lives, and things don't change  until we do.<br />I really love the cover of this book and the texture.

I was recently reading a letter printed on-line by Naomi Judd concerning her efforts in finding a cure for Hepatitis C, and she was assuring everybody that she  receives no pay for her efforts, and she was talking about how important  credibility is to her.  The whole time I was reading the letter, I was  thinking, \\"Why does she waste her time defending herself?  Who would ever  doubt this woman or care if she did get paid?  Her life speaks for itself.\\"   Whatever she gets, she deserves.  It doesn't even matter what she  says-it's what she IS.\\"  Naomi Judd makes me think of those lines that  Elton John wrote for Princess Diana-\\"You were the grace that placed itself  where lives were torn apart.\\"-\\"Called out to our country, and whispered to  those in pain....\\"  I think that when Naomi's life is over, God will smile  and say, \\"In this life, through good and bad, you learned love and  compassion and graciousness and reached out to the world with it.

I was reading some reviews on the various books written by and about Dr. Laura.  One reviewer, who claims to know her personally, basically said she's a joke and calls her &amp; her son, &quot;The obnoxious Dr. Laura and  Deryk,&quot; and says that the person writing the unauthorized biography is  right on.  He laughs at the people he calls &quot;dumb&quot; enough to  listen to her. Several reviewers have made comments wondering why Dr. Laura  seems to become more harsh and vicious as time goes on.<br />The sad thing  about Dr. Laura is that, on most accounts, she does have a good message.   Learning from her own mistakes does not make her a hypocrite (although, not  correcting the ones within her power to correct now, such as her  relationship with her mother, certainly does not help her credibility in  admonishing others to follow the Commandments).  She simply doesn't know  how to deliver her message. There are many people with messages similar to  Dr. Laura's who don't turn half the English speaking world against them in  the process.  She has set herself up as a &quot;Judge&quot; and has  overlooked one of the most fundamental rules of the Bible and  &quot;Laws&quot; of the &quot;Universe&quot;--&quot;Judge not that ye be  not judged.&quot;  &quot;Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap.&quot;   <br />I think Dr. Laura is becoming more &quot;vicious&quot; because she has  come to a point of constantly having to defend herself against other  people's judgments--judgments that she has brought upon herself and her own  family.  The sad thing about what I believe is her &quot;honest&quot;  concern for children and her desire to be a good mother, is that she will  not only &quot;Reap judgment&quot; all the days of her life, but she has  also brought that &quot;judgment&quot; upon her own child, through no  choosing of his own.  People are already watching him and waiting for him  to make mistakes, and he will reap the consequences of his mother's  mean-spiritedjudgmentalism all the days of his life.  To me, this is a  much more &quot;life-altering&quot; consequence than simply leaving a child  in Day-Care for a couple of hours.  Dr. Laura seems to always fail to see  the &quot;big&quot; picture.  I can't help but wonder if &quot;money &amp;  fame&quot; are more important to her than the effects that her  &quot;career&quot; may have on her child's life.<br />Other than some of the  unfortunate judgments she had made on groups of people, (which seem to be  costing her dearly), Dr. Laura's basic message of stop whining and take  responsibility for your life is good.  She might make a few friends of her  enemies if she would stop whining herself and learn to lighten up a little,  have some fun, laugh a little more and be a little less serious.  I have a  feeling the day will come when Dr. Laura will be forced to say, &quot;I'm  sorry.  I judged people, and I was wrong. I was operating from my mind and  not from my heart.&quot;  One day she will learn that humbling yourself and  saying, &quot;Will you forgive me?&quot; goes a long way towards healing  and mending broken bridges.	2000-06-14

I agree with the reviewer who said that he believes the positive reviews were connived by the author or his friends.  I found three or four recommendations for this book on a site dealing with  &quot;Reincarnation&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;--subjects that not  too many conservative, born-again Christians are going to be opening their  minds to study. It looked very &quot;planted&quot; to me.<br />Take it from an  ex-&quot;Born Again&quot;--your depression will return.  The Christian  faith contains the very &quot;seeds&quot; for depression--from their grim,  ridiculous version of an &quot;everlasting&quot; hell to their Old  Testament God who found it justifiable to slaughter people right and left,  to their narrow-minded judgment and intolerance of anybody with beliefs  differing from their own.  <br />I have only one thing to say about this  book--the author has a very narrow view of humanity, and the book has  little to do with the real problems of depression, but more to do with his  personal beliefs.  Anybody with an ounce of real &quot;Spirituality&quot;  or relationship with God would never venture to make the kind of judgments  he has made in this book about basically &quot;everyone&quot; who doesn't  fit into his narrow parameters of &quot;truth!&quot;  <br />If you are even  slightly intelligent and open-minded, don't waste your time, and don't be  fooled by positive reviews that sound like they were all written by the  same person!	2000-06-07

I loved Dooley &amp; the dog.<br />The only thing that I thought was a  little unrealistic about the book was the fact that those  &quot;mountain&quot; people were just a little too &quot;cultured.&quot;  I  live not far from &quot;Blowing Rock&quot; which is the town this book is  supposedly based on, and a lot of my relatives live in that area.  While  the &quot;accents&quot; were accurate, I've never known a single mountain  person in that area to attend an Episcopal Church--most of the people I  know don't even attend church.  An Episcopal church would be a little too  quiet and ritualistic.  Most of the mountain people I know prefer clapping,  foot-stomping churches.  I thought the &quot;grill&quot; where they all  gathered to eat was also a little unrealistic.  Most mountain people do not  &quot;eat out.&quot;  It would have been more realistic to have them gather  daily around a woodstove in some little country store.  (I've sat around  plenty of these stoves, with a bunch of men in overalls chewing their  tobacco).  <br />These books are great, though.  I love the progressive  relationship between Father Tim and Dooley, and the relationship between  Cynthia &amp; Father Tim is great!

Shirley Maclaine is the only actress I ever pay any attention to, and it is precisely because of her spiritual journeys &amp; the valuable information that she has to impart.  It amused me to read a couple of the  reviewers who were surprised that this book was so &quot;spiritual&quot;  and not completley focused on the &quot;Camino.&quot;  Obviously, they had  little knowledge of Shirley Maclaine when they started reading, or they  would have known going in that they were going to be reading about  &quot;spiritual&quot; adventures.  <br />A couple years ago at the age of 40,  completely caught up in Christian traditionalism, I started hearing a voice  telling me that hell did not exist and encouraging me to search and  question my beliefs.  I started having dreams about past lives (one life  during a period of intense racism, where I took a black child and raised  him)--another life as a passionate artist in Italy.  I didn't understand  what was happening to me, and there were times when I honestly thought I  was going crazy.  One night, I found Shirley's book &quot;Out on a  Limb&quot; under my bed.  I didn't have any idea how it got there--I live  alone, and I never purchased it.  But I started reading and realized I was  going through so many of the things that she described in this book.  When  she described her &quot;Out of body&quot; experience, I felt such a relief.   This happened to me several years ago, every single night for an entire  summer.  I didn't understand what was happening at the time.  I would go to  sleep, and the next thing I knew I would be out of my body watching myself  sleep.  My church taught us that out of body experiences were sinful, and I  never told anyone.  At the time it happened, it was confusing to me, and  although I felt that I could have gone anywhere or done anything--I didn't.   I simply sat there every night and watched myself sleep.  I wish I'd had  Shirley's books at that time in my life.  <br />The Camino is her best book of  all.  Thank you, Shirley.  You have been one of my &quot;teachers&quot; and  have helped me on an incredible spiritual journey of my own!	2000-05-22

I'd like to hear her &quot;explain&quot; the people of the Old Testament to whom these commandments were (supposedly) first given.  (I don't actually  believe it  ever happened.  I believe one of Dr. Laura's high priest ancestors from a  few thousand years ago sat down one day and wrote out the commandments he  decided needed to be imposed on society from his point of view).  No doubt,  the ideas and principles are good-I believe in honesty and integrity and  morality.  However--LOOK at the people they were given to, &amp; the  subsequent generations of people who were instructed to keep them.  They  were never able to do it!  As a matter of fact, nearly every generation (if  you believe the Bible) ended up abandoning them completely and resorting to  complete debauchery &amp; evil.  Those RULES placed a burden of guilt on  the people that they were NEVER capable of living up to, and subsequently,  they gave up and quit trying.  God's &quot;chosen&quot; people were some of  the bloodiest and most barbaric people who ever lived--slaughtering their  &quot;neighbors&quot; right and left (at God's command, of course--the same  God who &quot;issued&quot; the Ten Commandments).  If you choose to believe  the Old Testament, which is based mainly on pagan myths.<br />Dr. Laura is  right on in what she believes about moral character.  There is a need for  the commandments.  But she is operating from her &quot;mind&quot; and not  her &quot;heart.&quot;  Telling people what is wrong with them will not  change them.  Telling an alcoholic that he is stupid to drink, will not  stop him from drinking.  (It will only increase his sense of shame and  failure).  Telling a 14 year old who has been sexually abused all her life  to &quot;Honor her parents&quot; will not resolve the inner conflict  between what she knows and what the &quot;rule&quot; implies.  Life just  isn't that black &amp; white.  Dr. Laura will never &quot;fix&quot; the  world with her &quot;rules.&quot;  People are human, and they fail.  It's a  fact of life.  And there are a thousand &quot;gray&quot; areas in every  human life.<br />One day, when Dr. Laura begins to combine the compassion  &amp; forgiveness of God in her &quot;heart&quot; with the knowledge in her  &quot;mind&quot;, she will be truly effective--not in shocking people, but  in honestly helping them.	2000-05-18

The Abdication of Character, Courage, Conscience	Books	3	8	15	N	N	Legalism at its Best	I have very mixed feelings about Laura Schlessinger.  I have devoted my entire life to &quot;knowing&quot; God and certainly agree with many of her positions.  However, there is something disturbing about Dr. Laura and her  relationship (or lack thereof) with God.  She sometimes reminds me of the  &quot;Revered Pharisee&quot; with a &quot;cause&quot;--a lot of nice rules  that are not tempered with the &quot;grace&quot; or &quot;mercy&quot; or  &quot;love&quot; of God.  &quot;Preaching&quot; at people about what they  are doing wrong and their lack of responsibility has seldom produced any  deep change at a soul level for any human being.  Coming face to face with  true love and compassion has always produced deep and lasting change in  people.  Look at the life of Mother Theresa.  Ten years after Dr. Laura's  death, her harsh words will be forgotten.  Mother Theresa left an example  and legacy of love with her life that will never be forgotten. Dr. Laura  sometimes reminds me of Naomi Judd (whom I've met in person at a women's  seminar).  Naomi is deeply concerned about the issues Dr. Laura is  concerned about, but her personality radiates love &amp; warmth and  compassion and tolerance &amp; draws people to her instead of building  walls. Because of her belief in people, she causes them to believe in  themselves.  Dr. Laura tends to forget that people are just people, and  we're all human.   She also tends to be very naive and unrealistic.  I  watched her the other day on some t.v. show talking about how parents need  to plan their jobs around their children, work at home, etc.--whatever it  takes to be home with their children.  It's very easy for someone in a  place of &quot;privilege&quot; to adopt these views.  Dr. Laura needs to  get out in the real world more.  Let her spend a few months working in the  &quot;projects&quot; of any city or go into the poverty stricken coal  mining areas of West Va. and tell those people they need to work their  lives out to stay home with their children.  I know that many people shake  their heads at her &quot;simplistic&quot; views.<br />Dr. Laura would actually  do very well in Eastern religions with a &quot;Reincarnationist&quot; life  view, as &quot;Responsibility&quot; &amp; &quot;Consequences&quot; for  one's actions are the main theme.<br />Having said all of this, I believe that  God is working in Dr. Laura's life.  She is a person that people listen to,  and God is always interested in using people like her to bring his message  of &quot;love&quot; to the world.  One day, I believe God will give her a  &quot;Damascus Road&quot; experience, and she will never be the same.  She  will stop knowing God's &quot;rules&quot; and will truly know God.  It will  change her life and everyone who comes in contact with her.  I will  continue watching and look forward to seeing what becomes of &quot;Dr.  Laura.&quot;	2000-05-17

This interpretation would not only make the claims of Jesus true, (if  they were actually made) but would excuse him from being a liar or a  lunatic.  McDowell is ignoring other possible &quot;interpretations&quot;  of what Jesus meant and assuming that his is the only valid one.  <br />I find  it interesting that in all the &quot;supposed&quot; sayings of Jesus, he  never once validated his miraculous &quot;virgin&quot; birth.  He never  once said to the people (who obviously had a great deal of trouble  understanding him), &quot;My birth was miraculous--no father--I was  conceived by God!&quot;  That obviously would be something concrete that  anybody could understand.  He never said it.  He simply claimed to be God,  which could be interpreted any number of ways.  (I once met a drunk in a  bar who told me he was born of a virgin and was the Messiah sent from God  to save the world.  At least, his statement was definite, and left no doubt  in my mind as to what he was claiming concerning his birth).  <br />I'm tired  of unknowledgeable Christians throwing this book around as if it were  handed to them straight from God.  If you're going to not only believe  something, but try to convince others--at least know why you believe it!	2000-04-25

I am not an intellectual, as many of the reviewers here obviously are, so I could not argue the &quot;rightness&quot; or wrongness&quot; of Mr. Barker's concepts.  I can only say this.  I stopped believing in the Bible,  too.  I did not stop believing in God.  I recognize all the problems with  Fundamentalist Christianity and have chosen (knowingly) to remain in a  Fundamentalist Church.  I spent years teaching the Bible and the concepts  of salvation to women in prisons, to children in ghettoes, to homeless  people in shelters, etc.  (I was very passionate).  Although, I no longer  believe many of the concepts I taught, I do not regret the fact that I  spent many years doing so.  For whatever &quot;evil&quot; the Bible may  contain, it also contains much beauty and truth (whether taken as the  literal word of God or not).  It indeniably changes lives--something I saw  happen again and again and again over the years.  I have known many people  who were hurt by &quot;legalistic&quot; &amp; rigid, judgemental attitudes  in Christians.  I have seen the same happen in businesses, in families, in  any institution where humans are functioning together.  The hurtful thing  in Christians is that it is an underlying &quot;assumption&quot; that these  things should not be so in the church, (as if becoming a Christian suddenly  dismisses a person from being &quot;human.&quot;)  I have also seen some of  the greatest acts of love and giving and sacrifice among Christians (more  so than any other group of people).  <br />My own beliefs shifted from the  Bible to belief in eastern religions, which includes a belief in  reincarnation as opposed to hell. I believe that all of nature attests to  the fact of birth, death, rebirth, etc.  I also believe that where we are  in this life depends on the &quot;age&quot; of our &quot;soul&quot; or how  many times we have existed as humans on this earth.  Fundamentalist  Christianity, for all of its goods and bads and rights and wrongs, serves a  purpose for &quot;young&quot; souls who need the structure of organized  religions and have not yet reached a point in &quot;soul&quot; development  of &quot;questioning&quot; their beliefs.  I believe that Mr. Barker is a  &quot;mature&quot; soul and has come to that place of  &quot;questioning,&quot; (and rejecting) but has not yet opened his mind to  consider other aspects of &quot;God&quot; or &quot;existence.&quot;  I  would not be surprised in 10 or 15 years to see him write another book  reinstating his belief in God (although, he will never return to the Bible  or to his previous beliefs).  <br />We are all on a spiritual journey.  Mr.  Barker, whether any of us agree or disagree, is exactly where he needs to  be at this moment, as we all are (including fundamentalist Christians).   <br />I rememember the moment when God spoke to me and said, &quot;There is no  hell.&quot;  I asked him, &quot;Why didn't you tell me this 20 years and 20  churches ago?&quot;  He answered and said, &quot;You weren't ready 20 years  and 20 churches ago.&quot;  Life is a process and a journey, and we enter  into each higher level of consciousness as we are ready.  There should be  no judgement or criticism for anyone in this process.  I choose to remain  in the fundamentalist church (and not to share my personal beliefs) because  I love the people in this church, and they love me.  I have no need for  them to believe what I believe. One of the greatest lessons in life, which  generally comes in the &quot;mature&quot; or &quot;old&quot; soul stage is  &quot;Acceptance&quot; of all people and all beliefs.  <br />One thing I might  say as far as &quot;hurt&quot; in the church.  Jesus was literally  &quot;unoffendable.&quot;  It was impossible to hurt him because he was the  very essence of &quot;love.&quot;  A person who has reached this point in  life and become &quot;unoffendable&quot; will never be hurt in any church.   Buddha, who was born within 600 years of Jesus was thevery essence of  &quot;truth.&quot;  They were very different in their teachings, but they  both have impacted this world for centuries.  I believe they would have  been great &quot;friends!&quot;	2000-04-14

I spent years in church listening to pastors make fun of Shirley MacLaine and call her a kook.  I never thought much about it.  I enjoyed watching her in movies and thought she was &quot;amusing&quot;, but it never  occurred to me that she actually had something valid to say that would  influence and change my life.  Needless to say, one day I picked up one of  her books and started reading it out of curiousity.  It changed my entire  direction in life.  She makes the comment in her book that &quot;one book  generally leads to another&quot; which was certainly true.  I started  reading every book I could find on reincarnation and spirit guides, etc.  I  feel so much calmer and more balanced now, and I feel a great lack of fear  concerning the future.<br />The one thing I would like to see Shirley address  in future books is her relationship to other people as far as a  &quot;helping&quot; capacity.  In the two books I've read, we know that  she's had plenty of love affairs, and she gives us the history between  herself and her parents, etc.  Generally, a knowledge of our relationship  to God and to ourselves will result in compassion and a desire to reach out  to mankind and help in any way we can.  Shirley certainly accomplishes this  in providing us with her life narratives.  It would be interesting to know  how she incorporates this into her personal life and relationships with  others.	2000-03-29

I have read all of the &quot;Conversation&quot; books now, and I love them all.  I definitely believe God inspired many things through Neale.  However, there is one major area that I have my doubts about, and that is  the lack of accountability for our actions on earth, and God's statements  that he has no preference for what we do or don't do here.  I have just  finished reading &quot;Journey of Souls&quot; by Michael Newton, which is  equally as thought provoking as the &quot;Conversation&quot; books, and  they seem to dispute this completely.  Journey of Souls is written by a  psychologist who hypnotized people back into past lives and also had them  relive their experiences in &quot;heaven&quot; between lives.  They all  reported the same thing.  Souls are imperfect.  Our lives spent over and  over on earth are to do good and to learn and to strive for perfection.   Accountability for one life comes in the next incarnation on earth and is a  mutual agreement between soul and &quot;Spirit guide&quot; or  &quot;teacher.&quot;  I would recommend reading this book before completely  dismissing the idea of &quot;Accountability&quot; as Neale puts forth in  his books, as the consequences can be disastrous if we truly believe there  is nothing we need to do.  Conversations With God has definitely been a  major impact on the way I think about God, but so has &quot;Journey of  Souls&quot; impacted the way I think about myself and what I am doing here.   I think we are definitely &quot;responsible&quot; for what we do here.	2000-03-13

I had never given reincarnation any real thought.  I grew up in traditional churches &amp; accepted the Christian version of heaven and hell, although it disturbed me.  Christianity always seemed to me like a  &quot;victim&quot; religion where we are thrown into this world by God  without the slightest concern about our own preferences and left bewildered  and at his mercy concerning the bad things that happen to us (like Job of  the Old Testament).  It also seemed so unfair of God that each person  should have only one lifetime, and that one lifetime consists of such  horrible things for some people and not for others.  Reincarnation makes so  much more sense.  It makes us each responsible for what happens to us and  at nobody's mercy.  It also makes the bad things easier to deal with.  A  friend of mine, who is HIV positive, said, &quot;As bad as things may be,  it still is easier to feel that we somehow had a part in  &quot;choosing&quot; our circumstances for some &quot;higher&quot; reason  rather than simply having them inflicted upon us for no comprehensible  reason.  I would recommend this book to everyone, whether you believe or  not!  It'll change your thinking about what you're doing here.	2000-03-13

There is absolutely nobody else who has the power of &quot;description&quot; and &quot;Imagery&quot; that he has.   <br />I love Conroy's writing because it is always so contradictory.  He makes  you love and hate his characters at the same time.  I started out by being  completely annoyed with John Hardin in this novel, and then he ended up  being my favorite character--he was so funny and outrageous.  I felt the  same about his mother--loved and hated her at the time time.  I remember  this was also true of his characters when I read &quot;Prince of  Tides.&quot;  He has such an ability to play with the reader's emotions.   <br />Beach Music was harder than his other novels because of so many subplots  &amp; characters, but instead of wishing it hadn't been so long and gone  into so much, I found myself wishing it was longer, and he had developed  the characters &amp; subplots even more.  <br />There is always a feeling of  &quot;letdown&quot; when you finish one of Pat Conroy's novels because you  don't want it to end.  Nobody writes about &quot;dysfunction&quot; with his  sense of humor.	2000-03-09

About ten years ago, I went through a period of several weeks when I started having out of body experiences at night after I went to sleep.  I had never read or heard of anything like that before.  It was during a very  &quot;spiritual&quot; time in my life when I was literally praying and  seeking God continously every day, all day long.  I started waking up in  the middle of the night, except that I could see my body in a deep sleep,  but my spirit was separate and awake.  I didn't understand what was  happening.  I felt like I was somewhere else in a different dimension, and  I felt that I could have gone anywhere, but I never did because I didn't  know what was happening.  I just kept having those out of body experiences  and staying right there in my bedroom next to my body.  It was an  incredible feeling, but gradually I got busy and stopped praying as much,  and the experiences stopped.  <br />This book helped me realize what was  happening during that time.  I've always hoped to have those experiences  again, and now I believe I will.	2000-03-09

I remember years ago reading &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; by Russian author, Solzhenitsyn, and for weeks after I read this book, I could not take a bite of food without thanking God that I  had something to eat &amp; for everything that I was blessed with.   Angela's Ashes is the first book I've read since that has had the same  effect.  <br />America is becoming interested in the Irish, with our first  introduction to beautiful Roma Downey, on Touched by an Angel (who makes  you just want to cry on her shoulder), who also alludes to her difficult  childhood in Ireland with the death of her mother and the constant fighting  between Catholics &amp; Protestants.  She did a show recently on Ireland  that also made me cry, which indicates the Irish capacity to move people to  intense emotion and to almost bring you into their pain.<br />People have  criticized Frank McCourt's style of writing &amp; his long run-on  sentences, etc., but part of what I enjoyed about his book was this unique  style.  It was very easy reading, and I held my breath through every page,  praying he and his brothers would get something to eat before each day was  over.  <br />I will not usually buy a sequel in Hardback--I wait for the  cheaper paperback, but I immediately bought the sequel to this book.  It's  incredible reading!	2000-02-23

(Unless it doesn't)	I cannot resist a comment about the review from the Reader &quot;From Heaven.&quot;  I have never laughed so hard.  The Holy Spirit told him that God did not speak to Neale or anyone else (and yet He spoke to this reader  from Heaven to enlighten him on this fact).  I'm not being critical.  I  enjoyed it.  &quot;A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.&quot;  Another  reader was concerned when Neale said that he might possibly be a  &quot;poor&quot; filter.  I don't think that anyone ever attempts to  present  anything they feel they have received from God without an awesome  awareness of the &quot;responsibility&quot; inherent in the presenting and  some fear of what consequences may result in individual lives.   &quot;Poor&quot; filter or not, one only has to read through these reviews  and the amazing changes that have taken place in people's lives through  these books to realize that something &quot;good&quot; has filtered  through.  <br />I wrote in a review of &quot;Friendship With God&quot; that  there was a time in my life when I could not have accepted Neale's teaching  and would have considered him an &quot;Apostle of Satan.&quot;  On looking  back, I realize that I was actually an &quot;Apostle&quot; of  &quot;Pharisees&quot; and could not open my mind to consider anything other  than the traditions I had been taught.  My most earth-shattering revelation  came from God himself--not from Neale--the fact that every word in the  Bible is not the divinely inspired word of God. I was having these thoughts  during my prayers (without any books or anything to influence me in that  direction)because I was honestly seeking truth and questioning God and  desiring to understand.  It began to occur to me that the God presented in  the Old Testament seemed very similar to the mythological gods dreamed up  by the Greeks and Romans and given their own human characteristics--a  jealous, demanding, partial God who said, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot;  but seemed to haveno qualms about ordering the Israelites to go out and  slaughter entire tribes of people because they were an inferior, pagan race  of people.  (I believe we are all familiar with a man in our own history  who did the same thing).   <br />There is the story of Job, who is supposed to  inspire us all to an unrelenting faith--a man who was true and faithful to  God, and because of that very devotion, is permitted by God to have  everything in his life destroyed, his children killed, his body ravaged  with disease.  (Seems to me ol' Job might have done better to have remained  in another camp).  But, in the end, because of His faith, Job is given a  whole new set of children, along with 10 million dollars and lives happily  ever after! ( And this should be a lesson in faith for all of us.) It was a  lesson for me.  God is not concerned that Job has lost all of his children  and will most likely be a broken man for the rest of his life.  He has  received ample reward for his trials &amp; tribulations, and if we are  truly devoted to God, like Job, we might anticipate having our lives broken  &amp; ruined so that God can settle a personal score with Satan.  (No, I do  not believe this story was inspired by God).  <br />Jealousy is presented as a  deep sin in the New Testament by the apostles, but Christians have no  problem accepting a &quot;jealous God&quot; (which is also a clear Bible  teaching).  Although, it makes no sense to any of us, it's simply because  God is so far above our understanding that we can't hope to make sense of  it.  As far as &quot;hell.&quot;  We all know that not even a human being  (except perhaps the most base) would ever throw his own child into an  eternal hell for any reason, but we are perfectly willing to believe that a  loving, omnipotent God would have no problem with this.  (It's disturbing,  of course, but again, God is so far above us that we can't understand Him  or His motives).  One of the things that God spoke to me in this was,  &quot;Why would I even have a need for hell?&quot;  <br />No, I don't believe  that God tossed down one Holy Book with the entire truth for one group of  people, and those who are unfortunate enough not to come in contact with or  embrace that truth are condemned forever.  Those who choose that  &quot;camp&quot; I believe are truly &quot;Children of a Lesser  God&quot;--however, there is no condemnation in this statement.  We are all  in a different place, and there are many paths to God.<br />Many readers have  been incensed that Neale claims there is no devil.  I have an even more  heretical theory to enrage everyone (something that I truly suspect may be  true).  It's obvious that good and evil exist in this world and serve their  own purposes.  Neale has put forth the theory that joy and sadness are  actually the same emotion in varying degrees.  We know that everything is  God and comes from God.  I know Neale says there is no devil, but sometimes  I wonder if Satan does exist to serve his own purpose in this world and if  God and Satan are not actually the same person in differing degrees.  This  should have the entire fundamentalist world on their knees praying for my  poor &quot;misenlightened&quot; soul.  Who knows.  Maybe it's true.  Unless  it's not!	2000-02-18

The people who hate the books are  &quot;narrow-minded&quot; fundamentalists, and the people who love them are  godless &quot;New-Agers.&quot;  Surely the &quot;contention&quot; between  people in these reviews must be disturbing to Neale, considering the fact  that one of the basic premises of his books is the fact that there is no  one true path but many ways to God, whether we choose to embrace fear in  reaching God, or we choose freedom and love.  I personally relate to  everything everyone has written in these reviews, having been at each place  at different points in my life.  Ten years ago, as a fundamentalist  Christian, having never studied anything except the Bible and the teachings  of one or two mainline demoninations, I would have been completely unable  to &quot;receive&quot; what Neale had to offer and would have, myself,  condemed him as being an &quot;Apostle&quot; of Satan.  In the  fundamentalist churches, I was warned and taught to fear and hate the  &quot;Charismatics&quot; who are too attuned to the &quot;spirit&quot; and  are definitely receiving their information from Satan.  Eventually, I  embraced the Charismatic Church, where I was taught to be deathly afraid of  Shirley MacClaine and any of her &quot;New Age&quot; mumbo jumbo, unless,  of course, I wanted to end up in the fiery pits alongside her.  However,  having a searching heart and a desire for truth all my life and also a  rather rebellious spirit, I sneaked a peek at her &quot;forbidden&quot;  novels and found her to be fascinating and a woman with a sincere and  honest desire to discover true meaning in life.  This led to an earnest  study of all world religons, and I realized what a &quot;little&quot; world  I had lived in before and what a &quot;fear&quot; I had of opening my mind  and letting go of my &quot;self-hatred&quot; and my &quot;need&quot; to be  punished by an angry God.  Bottom line--there is some truth and some error  in every religion.  I think the &quot;Conversations&quot; and  &quot;Friendship&quot; books are wonderful, but I don't accept every word  as being straight from God's mouth.  Neale freely admits that he is a  &quot;filter&quot; the same as were the writers of the Bible and the Talmud  and every other Holy Book in history.  The secret is in doing exactly what  Neale has written about in these books--going to God and letting Him reveal  His truth to you.  God will not deny anyone who has a true desire to know,  but that desire has to come with a willingness to admit that maybe you  don't possess all the &quot;truth&quot; coming in and a willingness to  &quot;hear&quot; truth that may not agree with what you have been taught  all your life.  God cannot reveal anything to someone who already has his  mind made up!	2000-02-18
