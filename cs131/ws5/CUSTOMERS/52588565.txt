This book was one of only a couple available at my nearby bookstore, so I ended up with it by default--and after only a little practice, I hear songs I recognize, more or less! I like the way it is geared to adults and doesn't talk down to me. I am enjoying myself tremendously thanks to this book! But get the CD with it, if you can find it. My store didn't have it and I had to con the local music teacher into recording some of the unfamiliar pieces for me so I could check my rhythm and tempo.	2005-09-04

I remember the 1968 movie based on this novel fondly, but had never picked up the novel itself until just the other day. I was surprised at how different the book is. Although Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang herself is very similar in both, the plot of the story is much different. I enjoyed this simple little story, with Fleming's humorous asides, very much. Those asides reminded me of the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books I have read and I would be interested in learning if Lemony Snicket drew from Fleming's story style for his own series. This is a fun, quick story that most kids will enjoy. I do, however, fear that the admittedly crude illustrations in my original edition would not be as popular with modern children.	2005-09-04

As an English teacher, I am always looking for books to involveteens in reading--and it doesn't hurt if they teach a lesson or twoalong the way! This one fits the bill in both ways. The story, while it leaves some open areas (Terry's completely absent parents, the homosexuality of one of the main characters), and makes use of unfavorable stereotypes (drunken pickup drivers, antagonistic cowboys), is also bound to stimulate conversation in class and may even encourage readers to find out more about Vietnam, the Indian wars, or perhaps John Steinbeck or Shakespeare, who are featured as excellent authors to learn from. All in all, a great story just for reading as well as a book with terrific teaching possibilities!	2005-09-04

Attitude Distracting	Too much of this book strikes me as \\"I'm a Yale man and look at how fast I can solve the NY Times Sunday puzzle!\\" The author, too intelligent, apparently, to even waste his valuable time with the Monday or Tuesday NYT puzzles, reminds readers again and again of his own puzzle-solving times. On one hand, he demeans his efforts in contrast with top competitors, but on the other, we're always kept aware that his times are better than the vast majority of puzzle solvers. That said, I did enjoy the information about Will Shortz, whose puzzles I like trying on NPR and in puzzle books. Less Marc, more Will!	2005-09-03

However, the author's technique of skipping from one person to another, then returning to the first, distracts from the flow of the story. It is informative in its detailed discussion of the early days of weather forecasting by the US Signal Corps.

I don't think any reader will experience a windy, snowy winter's day in quite the same way again.	2005-08-16

Although I enjoyed reading \\"The Restless Sleep\\" very much and will recommend it to friends, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the organizational format of the book. Instead of following each one of the four intriguing cases to its conclusion, Horn divides the cases between several chapters. The large number of names becomes confusing and readers may find themselves flipping back to previous chapters about a particular case to refresh their memories about who was who in the 1951 Sanseverino case, the 1988 Diefenbach case, the 1977 Stapleton case, or the 1996 Leon/Martinez case. The book is wonderfully \\"real\\" and informative, but I will recommend skipping chapters, reading about one case in its entirety first before moving to another one.

It's an entertaining story, only feel free to allow yourself to skim the extensive descriptions if you wish. It's not illegal! After all, in what other book will you read words like \\"superexcellent\\" and \\"ikh\\"?

So disappointing, the way Picoult let me down with her conclusion! I was eager to find out which way the story would go, but to let me down in the end like this story does is a true disappointment.

Gabriel is a realistic depiction of an impatient, uncertain teenager. The plot line certainly keeps the reader involved, as we are curious to learn what new horror Marshall and Caleb will unleash on the people around them, as well as whether Gabriel and James will escape. But Durham's decision to present certain portions in italic with no names given to the people in them--even after we have been introduced to those people--struck me as striving too much for some mystical effect. I'm not clear on what this style is supposed to achieve and found it more annoying than effective.	2005-07-24

It explains yoga's benefits and contraindications. However, at risk of seeming narrow-minded, I'd ask for more use of English names of the asanas, particularly in the chapter which describes four sessions. Asanas are not listed by English names, which means I find myself flipping back to the pages listed to remind myself that Adho Mukha Svanasana is simply \\"Down Dog.\\" Used often enough, I'm sure the names will become familiar, but why not put English names in parenthesis at least? That would make the book much more accessible to beginners. Otherwise, a good book for beginners or experienced yoga practitioners.	2005-05-01

The book overwhelmingly uses melodies for learning, as opposed to chords. In fact, chords basically get only a brief mention at the end of the book. I'm sure this is because the mandolin does often carry the melody, but I was surprised, because Bay's \\"You Can Teach Yourself Mandolin\\" video begins with, you guessed it, chords. This book will improve your note reading abilities, as tablature is rarely used. A CD would be very helpful for hearing the pieces.	2005-05-01

I haven't tried the longer sessions yet for one reason: I lose the flow of the poses when I have to flip back and forth between the portion that shows all poses and the portion that shows each pose in more detail. Do I inhale or exhale here? It doesn't say in the section showing many poses, so I have to stop, flip back to the details, then start again. Sounds minor and it is, but it (and occasionally confusing drawings, as with \\"Threading the Needle\\") are drawbacks to what is otherwise a very useful book.

I didn't much care for the protagonist of this terrific novel--and that's a compliment to the author! I felt sorry for Christopher and I now understand the overwhelming world that autistic children must deal with if they are survive with any chance of success. But Christopher's screaming--he's 15!--at the littlest provocations really provoked a strong reaction in me. For an author to create a character whom I knew I would personally struggle to like, and yet to keep me very involved in his story, is a true accomplishment. I know I would not be a good parent for an autistic child, more like Christopher's mother than his ever-patient father. Christopher is at times likeable, at times irritating (for me, mostly the latter), but I did enjoy the book, I learned a lot from reading it, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who might come into contact with autistic people.	2005-04-03

Yes, there are some plot coincidences that purists may criticize, but they are handled so smoothly and believably that they become accepted events. Indeed, they are so believable that I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading a novel and not an autobiography! So often, the author's voice creeps through and interferes with a first-person narrative, but in \\"The Kite Runner,\\" Hosseini's narrator, Amir, is entirely authentic.

Having read \\"Getting Mother's Body\\" for a library book discussion group, I expected something out of my ordinary reading selection circle. And is it ever! I must say I enjoyed the book, though keeping characters' relationships straight was difficult--who is whose uncle? aunt? lover? brother? Furthermore, the characters' voices are simply too similar. They all sound alike, with their--pardon me for saying it--Ebonics English. Whether it is pregnant teen Billy Beede, her mother's lesbian lover's mother Candy Napoleon, or Laz Jackson, who has long has his \\"cap set for\\" Billy (despite her dislike of him), they all speak the same way--with \\"yr\\" and \\"I'ma\\" and \\"I says.\\" I sometimes thought I was reading a high schooler's email! Finally, I wish authors would take the creative time to come up with original names for their characters, instead of borrowing them from previous literature. My complaint here is with Dill, the lesbian pig farmer. For me, Dill will always be the little boy from Meridian, Mississippi, in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" What's to be gained from attaching that name to another character? The story line moves slowly, but is intriguing enough to keep a patient reader's interest, despite my qualifications of the way it is written.	2005-01-05

This story is filled with his experiments to draw out the beauty of words from a variety of children and can serve as an inspiration to anyone who is interested in children, education, and writing. If only all of us writing teachers had the chance to work so intensely with a relatively small group of students! If only we could talk to them one-on-one about their writing while another teacher worked with the rest of the class! Anyone who reads this and wonders why all teachers don't follow Swope's examples must realize the uniqueness of his situation.

A combination between a travel guide and a collection of memories, this book badly needs at least one more detailed map of Northern Ireland than the small ones provided at the start of each chapter. Fletcher makes the reader truly wish to visit many of the sites he describes, but one could never find them with the maps provided. Second, a few pictures, even black and white, would add immensely to the impact of Fletcher's words.

It was a joy to allow the imagery and personality of the prose to wash over and sink in as I read. The story is interesting and involving, even for a middle-aged male like I am. However, why do so many female writers seem to feel it necessary to create such unbalanced stories? There's not a single positive adult male in the book. Yes, there are minor male characters--the lawyer, June's boyfriend--but such minor personalities cannot compete with the hateful T. Ray and the racists in both towns. Meanwhile, all the women are flawless in their character. So June is hesitant about accepting two more into her household, she eventually comes around.

But this one is a pleasant surprise. Only one short chapter about family background, then much information from interviews with men the elder Woolley served with, but not focused on him in particular. It's informative and interesting and personable. I found new insights into the state of mind of men facing death daily, often before ever encountering the enemy, thanks to unreliable aircraft.

We've all heard of the incredible dedication that success in professional music performance--this book only reinforces that idea. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in classical music, whether a beginner or an informed veteran listener.

I enjoyed the book, which I read for a book discussion group, very much, although I found myself a little impatient for events to move on at times. And Swede is an engaging little girl of 9 who captures one's heart, but, darn it all, I had trouble accepting her precosity at writing. At times her vocabulary is a bit unbelievable, but more so is her use of inverted sentences and interior rhyme for a child raised on the Western prose of Zane Grey and others and on the King James Bible. Even so, the story will grab your interest with its entertaining and unpredictable characters and beautiful writing.	2003-07-20

Like many people, I eagerly awaited the 5th Harry Potter novel and read it cover to cover as soon as I got it. However, as much as I'd like to say it, I can't honestly say this one kept my attention quite as well as the previous books. Yes, it's a wonderful story, with all sorts of interesting new characters--my favorite was the dreamy-eyed Luna Lovegood, new challenges, and intriguing twists in the plot. But I'm afraid I wearied quickly of the \\"toad-ally\\" despicable Professor Umbridge (maybe because her \\"Educational Decrees\\" remind me too much of government interference in my own teaching position!!) and eventually became impatient with Harry's moodiness. Even Hagrid's stubbornness in his devotion to his dangerous \\"pets\\" (and you're in for a real surprise here!!) can get rather old after awhile! Yes, Harry's defiance and mistrust of adults is very true-to-life, but it's as exasperating in a novel as it is in a living teeanager! The climax is definitely up to the standards Rowling set in her previous books and readers must be certain to set aside plenty of time to read the last 150 or so pages in one setting, because they won't want to stop! Will I reread this installation multiple times, as I have the previous ones? I doubt it, except perhaps in the month or so prior to the release of \\"Harry 6\\" in order to refresh my mind on all that's happened. Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed, but they are going to have to be patient with this one for the rewards which are still here to be found. Enjoy!	2003-06-25

The ending explanation, given under a truth serum, is too pat to tie in with the wonderful detail in the rest of the novel. In all three of the previous novels, as well.

If you want your children to know about their heritage, then BUY THESE BOOKS! Don't worry about the person who says it misleads readers about the Native Americans--it doesn't. The original inhabitants of the Americas are highly complimented, with their many achievements described and their staggering variety of lifestyles nicely detailed. Yes, Hakim notes that when hunting became easier for the plains Indians, they tended to waste buffalo meat. She never accuses them of leaving the huge piles of disgracefully-rotting flesh on the prairies. And as much as we might like to think the Indians never wasted a single buffalo bone, well, it's not likely to be the truth. Those hunters were humans and like all humans, when life got easier, wasting became easier too. And to denigrate the entire wonderful series on the basis of one sentence is incredibly narrow-minded. Your children--and you, very likely--will return to this series again and again as the years pass. It's a worthy addition to any home library!	2003-03-28

Having had this book recommended to me because I am a fan of James Michener's work, I eagerly dove into this story of the earliest years of white settlement of Oklahoma. And I stayed immersed in it until the final page! Although Ferber's portrayal of blacks is dated and condescending, readers who can overlook this fault will find a plot and characters that grab their interest from the start. Curiously, although her Indian characters generally are flat and unpolished portrayals, those whites who speak up for the displaced Indians are quite eloquent in defense of those same Indians. The story of the Sooners, the Cherokee Strip, the impact of \\"Oil!\\" and the eventual statehood of Oklahoma is sure to provide an entertaining--and perhaps even informative and enlightening--selection for readers who don't mind the occasional purple prose paragraph. I'd recommend it!	2003-03-20

Lisa Jura's parents did recognize that danger and took advantage of an empty seat on the Kindertransport to send Lisa to the relative safety of the English countryside. Several other reviews have noted the \\"can't put it down\\" quality of this wonderful story. I must add my agreement to that sentiment! The only interruptions in my reading were stopping to play at least a snippet of the Chopin, Beethoven, and Rachmaninoff pieces on my CDs, so I could follow Lisa's enjoyment of them even better! This book should be used by all teachers who teach Anne Frank's story, as it is a beautiful look at the life Anne herself might have had had her parents only seen the danger in time.	2002-07-07

You know you're reading an old book when \\"flaccid organ\\" has nothing to do with sex! And what an enjoyable book this one is. Attracted by the pictures of the dinosaurs on the cover, I finally got around to reading it and recommend it to all lovers of adventure stories. Warning: You may need patience to wade through the wordy descriptions, but it's well worth it for the humorous encounters between the two Professors and the conflicts with the prehistoric world. Yes, Doyle reflects the racism of his day towards Indians and blacks, but readers who see his words as time capsules from an earlier time will not have a problem with them.<br /> My only complaint was that the odd, hopping carnivorous dinosaur is never linked to a dinosaur I am familiar with. Iguanadons, pleisiosaurs and even a stegosaurus are mentioned, but no specific name is given the most dangerous of all. Minor complaint, though.<br /> Grab a copy of this book and enjoy a trip to the wilds of South America's rain forest!	2002-05-25

This is a wonderful, thought-provoking story that my 7th graders have enjoyed very much. The relationship between Jerome and Bix is well-drawn and intriguing. The racist language has not been a problem, but the profanity has caused a little concern with some parents. That said, my personal problem with the book--and one that caused some confusion with my students--is the lack of quotation marks to indicate dialogue. The better readers pick up the flow of speech easily, but the slower ones get quite confused at times. I suppose the idea is to recreate the writing style of a young boy, but I tend to see it as somehow saying, \\"Look at my style--I'm writing like a young boy.\\" Otherwise, certainly a book for basketball fans to enjoy.	2002-04-29

Although it's obviously aimed at teenagers, people of any age will enjoy Sophie's journey of self-discovery and adventure. The adults play peripheral roles, but important ones, even so. They are even dynamic characters who change, much as Sophie and her cousin Cody change, though in more subtle ways. Teachers--I'm one--will find this book an excellent candidate for classroom use, as the female protagonist will appeal to girls, with Cody's own journal entries drawing in even the reluctant boy readers, too. As a further enticement, the edition I read, from Scholastic, has wonderful artwork by David Diaz at the beginning of each chapter. Find it, read it, share it!	2002-04-06

Since I'm usually the only male in the group, I always look forward to hearing female insights into characters like Trudi. By the way, is her last name--Montag--an intentional reference to Guy Montag from Fahrenheit 451, who, like Trudi, keeps the stories alive despite opposition and danger? I'd highly recommend this novel to men who might not normally consider it. You guys might enjoy the look at WWII from the home front of Germany, or you might appreciate the insight Trudi's stature brings her into men's lives. There are positive male characters as well as clearly negative ones, and the two groups make for a well-rounded and entertaining book.	2002-02-03

An English teacher myself, as Rousculp was, I expected to enjoy the book as a look back at the past, the past so often held up as the ideal in education. However, I was surprised at how similar many of Rousculp's dilemmas still affect teachers today--students swallowed by out of school demands, cheating, parents who don't care about their children's learning, budget crunches, low salaries and respect, unmotivated students, and so forth. Like Rousculp, I do truly enjoy teaching and experience many of the rewards he mentions, too. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the directions education is taking as well as where it has come from. My only reservation about the book is the author's occasionally overblown style, which can sometimes strike the reader as a transparent attempt to impress with obscure vocabulary. However, the content far outweighs the weakness in this excellent book.	2002-01-29

The hilarious, pointed observations of high school life alone make the book worth reading, but its understanding and insightful treatment of a serious problem makes it worth studying.<br />Boys may object, calling it a &quot;girl book,&quot; but I predict that they will enjoy the book within the first few pages as they laugh at Melinda's wickedly funny comments on high school and later sympathize with her conflicted emotions about &quot;Him.&quot; Get this book, read it, enjoy it, and pass it on to a high schooler you know!	2001-08-02

As Catherine, Isabel Thorpe, and the other girls their age frantically pursue wealth and status in the form of a fair-faced husband, Austen provides us with a splendid portrayal of a society. General Tilney's treatment of Catherine is only the most obvious of Austen's criticism's of the &quot;Bath society,&quot; for several other characters also behave selfishly.<br />Read &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; for several reasons. First, it is an entertaining novel--and that alone should give encouragement to a prospective reader! Second, it is a pointed description of a society based only on class and wealth, in which one's happiness depends upon securing &quot;a fortune.&quot; Finally, it is an accessible introduction to Austen's works and may encourage you to read more.<br />Enjoy journeying with Catherine Morland from her small town home to Bath and thence to Northanger Abbey and home again!	2001-08-02

This harsh sentence is strikingly similar to the one Jesse Pomeroy received over a century ago. Pomeroy spent over 50 years in prison for two heinous murders committed when he was 14. Of those years in prison, over 40 of them were in solitary confinement. To me, his survival of his punishment is more astounding than his crimes. I wish Schechter had devoted more space to Pomeroy's prison years than he did. I found the descriptions of Pomeroy's ceaseless attempts at escape both somewhat humorous and highly pathetic, as this man, hated across the US, constantly tried a variety of escape methods, even into his 70's. Where he would have gone had his attempts succeeded is an interesting question.  The book, while well-written, fails in its attempt to prove that things are no different now than they were in the 1870s. Yes, Jesse's crimes were terrible, but the main difference between then and now is the number of crimes committed by children. The very reason Jesse was so hated was the unique brutality of his crimes. Today, we hear of similarly brutal acts by children every day, to the extent that we simply shake our heads and then go on with our lives. I disagree with Schechter's repeated premise that today's society has not influenced more children to violence than did the dime novels of the past.  Given that, &quot;Fiend&quot; is still an excellent account of a crime that shocked the nation--and of a punishment that SHOULD shock people everywhere even today. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in crimes and criminals.	2001-03-10

Greene does a fine job of weaving the histories of his father and Paul Tibbets with the presents of both men--his father's last weeks and Tibbet's life in his 80's. Although the abrupt jumps in time and person can be rather disconcerting, links between the topics can be followed with a little care in reading. A couple of problems--1) Greene repeatedly draws attention to how little attention Tibbets draws in public. Well, that is as Tibbets himself would have it, as he has never been a publicity seeker. Although it is sad that many in later generations don't know Tibbets' name, why Greene should find it so upsetting that this man in his 80's is rarely recognized is beyond me. I have long been interested in WWII and Tibbets' deeds were already familiar to me, but I'm sure I would never recognize him in public! That's not tragic, as Greene apparently would have us believe, it's just a fact.  2) Tibbets frequently criticizes the generations that have followed his. Yes, his generation is worthy of high praise for their tremendous sacrifices, but only once--in passing--do Greene and Tibbets ever recognize that it was Tibbets' generation that raised the children who rebelled in the 60's. They blame cultural changes such as music and television, but never clearly accept responsibility for their own role in raising their own children. This is a serious oversight that I have found in several books about the &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot; And no, I am not a member of the first generation of children born to those returning veterans.  Despite these two caveats, I recommend &quot;Duty&quot; highly and plan to use excerpts from it with my high school students. Read it and see what you think!	2001-02-10

Allende takes the interested reader on wonderfully memorable journeys into these times and places. However, she does not neglect detailed characterizations, which makes this novel an exceptional one. Independent Eliza Sommers is one of my favorite characters, and the understanding Tao Chi'en is an outstanding male protagonist, caring, patient and intelligent. Although I never disregard a novel simply because of an open ending, I was disappointed in the relative abruptness of the ending of &quot;Daughter of Fortune.&quot; After 400 pages of exceptionally-detailed character and setting development, I found the uncertainty of the last few pages of this novel a let down. There's no need to draw me a perfect picture of who ends up with whom, but I dislike being left with the impression that the author was not sure what to do with her characters, and so she contrived a quick, ambiguous conclusion.	2001-01-01

Read this novel in an uninterrupted sitting and find yourself swept away by beautiful prose, unbelievable remedies, and the terrors and superstitions of another place and time! The plot of &quot;Of Love&quot; is well summarized in other reviews, but my recommendation is to approach it with no foreknowledge of what's ahead. Just allow yourself to fall in love with the tragic story of young Sierva Maria and her doomed lover, the bookish librarian/exorcist Cayetano Delaura. If you have ever found yourself wrapped up in the love affair of your dreams, you will sympathize with the many lost loves described throughout this wonderful novel! As other reviewers have noted, this novel is a perfect introduction to the luminous prose of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and will draw you into further explorations of his work.	2000-12-31
US	52588565	RU90XARTPJ20N	0684869098	220640963	Lost At Sea	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Insightful and frightening	Although a blurb on the cover of my edition of this book claims that it is superior to \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" I must disagree. Both are excellent stories, but I missed Junger's descriptions of the last moments of the Andrea Gail in \\"Storm.\\" After finishing \\"Lost,\\" I felt that there was more that could have been said--or surmised--about the fates of the two boats so tragically lost. While realizing that no one will ever know for sure what happened to the boats, I anticipated more details about the possible reasons for their loss. Some of those details do appear in the investigation of the disaster, but in a dry, courtroom form. Why call this book frightening? For two reasons. First, I'm frightened and dismayed by the fishing industry's utter lack of concern for the very fisheries that keep it going. Their modus operandi seems to be \\"fish them for all they're worth, until they're worthless, then move on to another area, and to heck with the environmental impact.\\" When will they realize the extent to which they are cutting their own economic throats? Second, the industry is obviously uninterested in protecting the young men and women who man its boats and ships. To fight so determinedly against the logical and reasonable laws providing for simple safety is completely, well, unreasonable and irresponsible. If you're looking for an edge-of-the-seat thriller of adventure at sea, you will be disappointed in much of the book, although the author's own experience as described in the final chapter is fascinating. However, if you're looking for an intelligent and intelligible account of a terrible tragedy and the legal and political maneuvering which followed it, this is a book to read. It's too bad, though, that the publishers did not include any photographs, at least not in the paperback volume. For those of us completely unfamiliar with crab boats and their equipment, photos or more diagrams would be invaluable.	2000-12-30

Maybe it was reading this novel over Christmas vacation, maybe it was the fact that this novel was a change of pace from much heavier reading, but I found &quot;Jemima J&quot; an immensely entertaining story with intriguing characters, some of whom are nicely dynamic, changing as the story moves along. Take Geraldine, for instance. As Jemima seeks her insight, Geraldine is there to offer it. Would Geraldine offer such friendship to a fat Jemima? That's not the point. Jemima does lose weight (unrealistically quickly, I admit!)and perhaps it is the change in her own self-perception that makes people notice her. Yes, many overweight people live full, happy lives, but Jemima is not one of them and losing weight allows her to see herself as the talented, beautiful woman she had long kept hidden as she cut out pictures of models or read books or hid behind her weight.  Ok, so there's a nice Hollywood, fairy-tale ending, but so what? Jemima learns to accept herself as she is, neither boyish nor obese. What better lesson (for those who insist on a lesson in light fiction) could be drawn from a fun, creatively-written novel?	2000-12-28

Should I worry that so many reviewers found the kidnap scene funny? Perhaps, but the true strength of this novel lies in its insight into the confusion and uncertainty felt by Sue and David particularly as they find themselves caught in a plot to scare a disliked teacher which soon spirals out of control. Duncan also does an excellent job of capturing Brian Griffin's dedication to his students and his reasons for being so demanding. Thus, readers are swept along with alternating sympathies, first for lonely Sue, then for the kidnapped Mr. Griffin, then for Mrs. Griffin, who knows Sue is lying about her husband's last hours, finally for David, who suffers a terrible loss himself as the story draws to a close.   This is an outstanding book which will grab and hold the attention of any reader who has ever wished to exact revenge on someone in power, be it a teacher, boss, or even parent.	2000-12-28

The story of retiring Billy Chapel's final game, pitching against the vaunted Yankees, is one for all baseball fans, but the love story which winds itself through Billy's mind between his trips to the mound is one for every romantic. I enjoyed the story immensely, thanks to the character development as a star athlete faces the end of his career. My only complaint is due to the many fragments employed by the author as he attempts to recreate Billy's thoughts and discussions. Frequent uses of &quot;So.&quot; and &quot;But.&quot; as sentences is distracting and left me with the feeling that the novel had not been edited one final time.  Even so, this short novel is a jewel for anyone interested in the men who played the game for love, not for the unbelievable sums of money now demanded by players.	2000-12-28

I felt his drive to experience all that he could of black musicians' unique styles, even whether it meant risking life and limb in unsavory parts of town or playing his best for acceptance on those stages where his idols performed.

Yes, this is a Western, but not in the &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; style so favored by other writers.  Kelton takes the time to develop the hopes and fears of young Joey Shipman as he seeks the family he fears he has lost. Can he find it in the drunken cousin he has met only once? Or in the abused prostitute? He certainly will never find it with the stepmother who seems to live to hate him, or with her murderous second husband. With nary an Indian attack, cattle stampede, or shoot-out at high noon, &quot;Cloudy in the West&quot; is a Western in a style all its own, a style which sets it apart from--and above--the majority of others in the genre.

I'm not normally a lover of Westerns, but I have Mr. Kelton's granddaughter in a class I teach and she talked a lot about her author grandfather, so I finally gave in and purchased a copy of one of his books.  I guess I owe the granddaughter a big &quot;Thank you,&quot; as &quot;Buffalo Wagons&quot; is terrific!  Gage Jameson is an unusually well-rounded character for the genre.  A veteran buffalo hunter, he has seen the northern herd wiped out.  While he mourns the loss of the old ways, he also acknowledges his own role in that loss.  Furthermore, even as he heads south into Comanche country, he agonizes that he is contributing to more destruction of the world he loves.  This does not stop him, though, for buffalo hunting is all he knows.  The antagonists include the Comanches desperate to save their way of life, although they are certainly not romanticized, and some of the white men Jameson trusts to travel south with him.  Kelton's vivid descriptions of the llano estacado take the reader to that inhospitable land, with all of its beauty and danger.  The plot contains enough twists--always credible and logical--to keep the most particular reader satisfied.  I am eager to read more of Kelton's Westerns and am highly recommending them to my students and friends.	2000-12-02

Gangly, unattractive (or so she believes), orphaned, she has only her women friends until handsome, mysterious Aidan Ferrel sweeps her off her feet. Unfortunately, Aidan hides a secret much worse than the inheritance Una keeps hidden from her friends. As her love for Aidan grows, you wonder if he is indeed returning the love in kind. By the end of this memorable, powerful novel, you'll know. Or will you? Some readers will undoubtedly be uncomfortable with the uncertainty remaining at the end of &quot;Water, Carry Me,&quot; but others will thrive on discussing that very ambiguity. This is a powerful, memorable novel which reminds every reader of some of the deep-rooted causes of the &quot;Troubles&quot; which continue to plague Northern Ireland. A word of caution--a basic knowledge of that conflict will help you to understand much of the political discourse in this novel. Although it is subtitled &quot;A Love Story,&quot; it is much more than that, if it is indeed a love story at all! Read it and judge for yourself.	2000-11-05

Why? O'Nan's use of the second person point of view is the primary reason, but his stark, descriptive prose is also memorable.  Because &quot;you&quot; are the main character in this unusual novel, the reader finds himself or herself immediately involved in Jacob Hansen's fight against diphtheria, fire, self-doubt, and fear. Through Hansen's eyes, &quot;you&quot; see the disintegration of Friendship, both as the Wisconsin town he loves and as the loss of companionship and trust inherent in true friendship. Many of the events and desriptions are gut-wrenching, truly visceral, and made more so because they happen to &quot;you.&quot; Beautiful prose makes even the more sickening scenes powerful. If the true worth of a book is the effect it has on its readers, then &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot; is indeed a worthy novel.	2000-11-05

Disappointed in the cynicism of &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; I  approached reading &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; with less eagerness  than I had anticipated when I bought the book.  However, whereas the former  book was full of Bryson's boredom and disgust with much of the U.S., he  finds Australia a continually fascinating country and sparks my interest in  touring it someday soon.  Bryson sprinkles anecdotes about Australian  cultural and natural history liberally throughout his text, which enlivens  his present adventures and sets a valuable context for a vast country.   Personally, I love the historical insights and am pleased Bryson includes  them because so much of what he writes is not found in most history books.   The same goes for the natural history details.  Far too many tourists fail  to appreciate the significance of their natural surroundings, sounding  instead like the woman who, viewing the unbelievably ancient stromatolites,  could only remark, &quot;Are you telling me we just crossed a continent for  this?&quot;  She completely missed the awe which Bryson felt upon  reflecting on stromatolites' role in the development of life on earth!  Bryson's books are invariably informative, almost always funny, and  consistently insightful looks at the areas he visits. His under-the-surface  style of revealing the past and the present of Australia is most  appropriate and he has convinced me that I must put Australia on my  &quot;to-visit&quot; list!	2000-08-05

Books	3	13	14	N	N	Frustration lies in the details	I have enjoyed a number of Ames's step-by-step drawing books and was excited to find this one.  However, I was somewhat disappointed in it.   Here's why.  Whereas Ames's other books show completed pictures very much  like what I could produce by simply following the steps, in this book, the  final results are invariably much more polished with shading and shadowing.   That's not a problem in itself, except that Ames provides no instruction  or steps which show how to accomplish those additional details.  Thus, my  frustration.  I want my final results to resemble Ames's as closely as  possible, but I'm not told how to achieve this.  Otherwise, the basic steps  are, as always, useful and easy.  Just don't expect to learn the details  here, even though they are shown in the final picture.	2000-08-05

If you are going to create the Devil incarnate and place him, with 5 female victims, in the midst of the Congolese jungle in the guise of a white Baptist minister, then the least  you could do is let Nathan Price speak for himself.  Instead, you filter  all of our perceptions of this tortured and hateful man through the eyes of  his wife--who no longer believes in him or his religion, but cannot leave  until tragedy strikes--or his daughters.  All too often children judge  their parents with either too much forgiveness or too much harshness, and  the latter is certainly the case here.  Although I enjoyed &quot;The  Poisonwood Bible&quot; and its depiction of native Africa very much, I  can't help feeling robbed that you never let Nathan speak for himself.  Oh,  he quotes the Bible right and left, but you never let us see what inner  changes have driven him to risk his family's life and health in Africa.   Even worse, once tragedy has struck, you don't even let Nathan preach--all  we hear are rumors passed from mouth to mouth until one of the girls passes  them on to us.  So, although I obviously liked the novel and although I  probably would agree with most of the positive statements by other  reviewers--thus the 4-star rating--I was disappointed in your lack of  balance.	2000-07-31

Ages 9-12 shouldn't get to have all the fun!  &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; is a terrific story for anyone who has ever wanted to fly or gazed longingly at a poster of a favorite athlete, wishing that athlete  could come to life.  JK Rowling makes it happen and if your imagination  hasn't been too stifled and trodden down by the concerns of everyday life,  then this book might be for you, no matter what your age. &quot;The Goblet  of Fire&quot; is exciting, funny, frightening and impossible to put down.  I kept telling myself &quot;just one more chapter&quot; until I had  finished the final 450 pages in one fell swoop!  The hype and hyperbole  proved to be fully justified and Ms Rowling has shown herself to be a  wonderfully creative and insightful writer.  As a junior high and high  school English teacher, one of my main frustrations is the fact that my  students don't want to read for pleasure, even when given time to do so in  class.  However, the Harry Potter series has renewed the hope with which I  began my career 15 years ago, that books and good, old-fashioned  story-telling and imagination weren't yet out of style.  Thanks, Ms  Rowling, for Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron and the rest of the Hogwarts gang,  yes, even Draco Malfoy, the kid we all love to hate!  And thanks, too, for  bringing back my own junior high memories after all these years with your  refreshingly honest and accurate portrayals of young boys and girls  discovering new experiences and getting to know each other again for the  first time.	2000-07-24

First, let's get the nitpicks out of the way.  Like other reviewers, I was bothered by the poor editing of this memoir, with its verb tense switches and simple errors in usage. <br />However,  I was most disappointed that Loung  Ung ended her story with her boarding the plane for America.  I had fallen  for this spunky, strong-willed little girl and wanted to read about her  experiences in her new home in Vermont.  Please, Ms Ung, write a new  chapter to your story! Tell us how you adapted to Vermont and your new  American lifestyle.  Your epilogue only hints and teases at the new life  you found here and many of your readers are bound to want more! Tell us  more about your crusade to banish landmines and about your visits to  various American cities as you speak about Cambodia's past and future.   We'll be looking forward to it!<br />As for this volume, it is as most  reviewers have said--an uplifting story of survival in the most horrific of  circumstances.  Five-year-old Loung's curiosity and perseverance are truly  wonderful to behold as she watches her comfortable world destroyed by the  Khmer forces.  <br />The &quot;dream&quot; or &quot;imagination&quot; passages  in which Loung describes the possible ways in which two of her sisters, her  mother and her father all died are to me the most heart-rending of the  entire book.  It doesn't matter that they may not necessarily describe the  actual events.  What's important is that they describe the events as they  were imagined by a child, a child who should never have had to imagine such  things.  To Loung, the deaths were the overriding fact and the created  details of them were her child's way  of visualizing her loved ones' last  moments, not in a morbid way, but in a sympathetic way.  <br />Another aspect  of the story that struck me was the strength of the desire to reach America  and the deprivation and dangers many Cambodians were willing to risk to  enjoy the life most US citizens take for granted.  Simplyincredible--and  still important today as the US government and people struggle with  immigration concerns and as the gap between the &quot;haves&quot; and the  &quot;have nots&quot; of the world grows ever wider.<br />This is an amazing  story, an inspiring story, and an unforgettable story that will affect you  long after you have read the final sentences.	2000-07-18

Rarely do I find the movie adaptation of a novel superior to the novel  itself, but that is the case with &quot;The End of the Affair.&quot;   Perhaps it's because I saw the movie first and thus formed certain opinions  in my mind before reading the book, but that has not been the case with  other book/movie combinations.  My main problem was that I could not  sympathize with Bendrix, who narrates the story of his love affair with  Sarah.  What an insecure, neurotic man to be blessed with such a wonderful,  understanding woman.  Why Sarah puts up with his whining jealousy for so  long, I cannot figure out.  She seems to draw men like lights draw moths,  so she must have had her choice of them for an affair.  To choose Bendrix  is her mistake, for he is jealous of any past lovers she may have had, of  her current husband Henry, of any future lovers she may have, and  eventually, of God, who &quot;wins&quot; by taking Sarah's life just as  Bendrix and she are about to renew their affair.   Why was the movie  better?  I was more sympathetic to the disfigurement of Parkis' son's face  than to the original in which Smythe is simply difficult to bear.  In fact,  the movie's portrayal of Parkis and his son was fantastic and truly the  highlight of the film.  The sentimental side of me also liked that Sarah  did get to make one last trip with Bendrix, a trip never made in the novel.  Finally, the abruptness with which her death comes in the novel was simply  unsatisfying.  Her death seems rather melodramatic regardless of how it is  depicted, but the movie's showing Henry and Bendrix drawing close to her as  she dies is, well, just better.  If you've read the book, try the movie--I  trust you'll love it.  If you've seen the movie, then let the book be and  enjoy the Hollywood version, rare in its superiority to the novel.	2000-07-09
US	52588565	R20FJCLRZSI38Q	0609603825	602895896	The Forest	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Making history great fun!	Having read &quot;Russka,&quot; &quot;London,&quot; and &quot;Sarum&quot;  and enjoyed them all, I was eager to read &quot;The Forest&quot;--and I  wasn't disappointed, overall.  Some people might complain that the New  Forest area of England is hardly worthy of such a long novel, but  Rutherfurd's interest in and portrayal of the &quot;small people&quot; of  the forest make fascinating reading.  In fact, I'd have much preferred more  about the forest dwellers and somewhat less about the &quot;society  types&quot; who dominate so much of the book.  Give me more Puckle and  Seagull any day!  Even so, the book is well worth the time for anyone who  has ever entertained an interest in England and English history.   Rutherfurd's literary strength lies in his wonderful descriptions of the  natural world in which his characters move and I often found myself  rereading paragraphs in order to soak in that description.  As for his  characters, I enjoyed them, but the copy I read would have benefitted from  a family tree similar to the one found in &quot;London,&quot; although  Rutherfurd throws in enough physical similarities and references to  ancestors to help his readers keep the characters quite distinct.  I also  have a couple of nitpicks about the book.  In one spot, the owl is said to  be able to turn its head 360 degrees, which is incorrect.  Also, the mark  of the arrow in the Rufus tree is said to have grown higher with the  passing decades.  This also is incorrect, as trees grow from the ends of  the branches out and a mark in the trunk never gets any higher.  These are  quibbles with a wonderfully readable story which I am otherwise happy to  recommend.	2000-07-09

He had the chance many of his readers would love to have--travel throughout the US with apparently no money or time constraints.  (Even if a Chevy Chevette may not be everyone's idea of  comfortable travel!) However, the main word Bryson can find to describe  places he doesn't care for is the oft-repeated &quot;boring.&quot;  The  Mississippi River is &quot;flat and dull,&quot; and merely driving is  almost invariably &quot;boring,&quot; unless the scenery is spectacular.   Ah, what's a guy to do when he has book to write?  Carry on, despite  overcrowded national parks, sleepy small towns, ignorant people and the  occasional threatening weather.  Still, in spite of the negative attitude  Bryson so frequently adopts, the book is entertaining and enlightening.   Perhaps I enjoyed it so much because I agree with so many of Bryson's views  about the over-commercialization of America's natural wonders and  historical places. I also sympathize with his regrets for the lost small  towns, particularly the downtowns which have been decimated by the  development of malls, strip malls, large discount stores and fast food  franchises until all small towns look depressingly the same. Perhaps the  best thing one can say about a book like this is that it made me want to  make my own journey of exploration, to discover the country on my own.  And  that, I believe, is the response any travel writer would love to have.   Bryson succeeds and so I recommend the book to all readers who can smile at  the foibles of America and Americans, including, perhaps, themselves.	2000-07-09
US	52588565	R3BX4PTAC1WEYQ	0553379267	284019128	A Canticle for Leibowitz (Bantam Spectra Book)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Still valid after all these years	Imagine North America divided into entities named Laredo, Texarkana, Chihuahua, Denver, and the Mississippi Republic and you have the beginnings of the post-nuclear holocaust world created by Walter Miller in &quot;A  Canticle for Leibowitz.&quot;  Nuclear devastation, followed by a  &quot;cleansing&quot; of all educated people held responsible for the  development and deployment of nuclear weapons, has left a world in which  &quot;Simpleton&quot; is a term of respect and knowledge is considered  threatening.  However, the monks of the abby named for Leibowitz, an  engineer martyred for trying to preserve books and writing, continue to  save every scrap of information from the time before the destruction and  Simplification, even cherishing a shopping list in Leibowitz's own hand.   Through all three sections of the novel, a burlap-clad  beggar/traveler/mystic moves, leading me to wonder if he is not somehow a  reincarnation of Leibowitz himself.  The man is mostly an observer who only  occasionally influences the action, but his presence is always tangible.   He watches as the world progresses (?) from huddled communities connected  only by footpaths beset by robbers and murderers to city-states with  renewed nuclear capabilities--but without the sensibilities and cautions  that should have come from having already seen one disaster unleashed.   Inevitably, it happens again.  What knowledge and beliefs will survive?   What should survive?  Who should survive?  You'll have to discover (or  rediscover) this 41-year-old masterpiece for yourself!  As to why only four  stars in my rating, it's simply that the somewhat extensive use of Latin  phrases left me wondering what I was missing because of my unfamiliarity  with the language and Catholic church custom.	2000-06-04

However, William Least Heat-Moon's  earlier books fascinated me with their combination of travelogue, social  history and natural history, and I expected the same from &quot;River  Horse.&quot;  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I enjoyed this book much  more than &quot;PrairyErth&quot; even though I grew up only a few miles  north of Chase County, KS, the subject of the earlier book.  Although he is  constantly impelled to move onward and westward for fear (unfounded mostly)  of having too little water in the West, Heat-Moon still takes plenty of  time to learn and relate the histories of many of the small river towns he  finds along the way.  This is the sort of personal, anecdotal history at  which he excels and which I enjoy.  Unlike &quot;Blue Highways,&quot; this  book did not necessarily make me want to attempt the trip myself--my lack  of familiarity with boats and rivers would be a major hurdle!  However, it  did send me looking for more information on many of the sites and I have my  own list of places I now hope to visit as a result of reading this book.   In a way, I feel some of the same need for hurry as Heat-Moon did, though,  thanks to the insane amount of control large farming and corporate America  have over what are supposed to be public lands and waterways.  Who knows  but that by the time I can visit some of these areas, they may be flooded  by a new dam or eroded to nothingness by thousands of cattle hooves?  Some  may not appreciate the political bent of this book, but I find it  understandable that if a person loves an area enough to row, push and carry  a canoe through it, then he should speak up for it in every way possible.   Get in touch with the America too few of us appreciate by reading  &quot;River Horse&quot;!	2000-06-04

For such a wonderful, even uplifting story, it seems overly picky to quibble about the author's decision not to use quotation marks.  However, so much of this story involves the give and take between characters, I  found this peculiar punctuation to be irritating and sometimes confusing.  What's the possible reason for this?  Frank McCourt does the same thing in  'Tis and 'tis just as frustrating!  Maybe it's the English teacher in me  for 14 years, but I don't like it.  Otherwise, I can say little more about  the story than has already been said.  It's fascinating and I have been  enthusiastically recommending it to my classes and to my reading friends.	1999-12-07
