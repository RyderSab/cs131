This book is different from every other introduction to general relativity I know. And better. The eminent authors connect geometry directly to physics, bypassing tensors. Curvature in space is detected by very simple length measurements; curvature in time, by the lengthening of periods of oscillations. There are nuggets in almost every page. I loved the demonstration that you don't really need coordinates to describe geometry: the shape of a boat is reconstructed entirely in terms of distances. Their dynamical principle is the maximum proper time principle. The way they derive energy and momentum from this principle is sterling physics. You'll learn a lot of general relativity in this book. Not all of it. But, learning to love it, you'll learn the advanced topics that cannot be treated this way by yourself, in other books. Perhaps in the huge Misner, Thorne, Wheeler.	2002-04-11

However, this is not one of those books which capture your attention, like, say, Kernighan's books, or even &quot;Learning Perl&quot;. You have to fight against this book. This is mainly for the following reasons, IMHO:<BR>1. Jargon is used too frequently. If you are not a hacker (in the good, original sense) you have to work against the language (not Python, English!), too. I had to reach for the &quot;Hacker's Dictionary&quot;, now and then. For instance, the word &quot;hook&quot; is used in a technical sense without being explained.<BR>2. Object is never defined. In the &quot;official&quot; tutorial, which is much shorter, a clear and concise definition is given. This is  badly needed, for &quot;object&quot;, in the python world, is different that in <BR>C++, or smalltalk, world, where it is a class instance. In python it is the triple (type, address, value).<BR>3. Phrases like &quot;Classes are mostly just namespace&quot; don't help the beginner who wants to know what distinguishes a concept from another. These abstractions are premature.<BR>4. The too frequent use of Monthy Python terms like &quot;spam&quot; and<BR>&quot;eggs&quot; is ridiculous, and makes the examples seem totally useless pieces of programming.<br />So, I think this book is perfect for one who is a personal programmer and wants to learn quickly what Python is all about. He will probably like the book for the very reasons I complain against it. The subtitle is correct: Help for Programmers.<br />Still, you'll learn the language. But with a fight!	2002-02-10

This advanced book exposes the mathematical framework of quantum field theory, as discovered by Wightman, who explained, in an article published in Physics Today, that he was led to such abstract language in order to understand the forces that bind the deuteron nucleus! This was only the beginning: present books and papers on the structure of quantum fields employ (and develop!) mathematics which make the Streater-Wightman book look like Harry Potter. Still, this book is assumed reading for all these advanced studies. It is extremely well written, for one thing. The initial chapter introduces the concept of free particle along ideas which I think belong to Wigner: particles are irreducible representations of the Poicare group. So, group theory is necessary for the grammar of quantum field theory. Fields require Schwartz distribution theory, as intuitively discovered by Bohr and Rosenfeld. Then follow general theorems for local field theory, like spin-statistics, CPT (and all that...). There is now an appendix where more modern topics are presented, but the core of the book is more or less what I described. This is a great book, written with great care and wit. It is a pity that most physicists, even quantum field theorists, did'nt read it.	2002-01-26

It is, of course, not a book for beginners: the very Planck, who was the editor of the Annalen der Physik, where the German originals were published, had to ask for explanations a few times, in order to grasp the meaning of the &quot;Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;. The teaching of relativity is now done in a rather different way, emphasizing, from the beginning, the 4-dimensional picture, as in Taylor-Wheeler's &quot;Spacetime physics&quot;. Einstein's paper is on a modification of electrodynamics to make it agree with the tenets of relativity (the particular inertial frame being used is of no effect at all). In order to do that he finds it necessary to change mechanics, and actually the very basic concepts of mechanics. In contrast, the great paper on general relativity &quot;Foundations of general relativity&quot; has pedagogical preocupations, and is quite readable, including an interesting introduction to tensors which clearly shows that, master of the physics of the problem, Einstein was a novice at the mathematics of it. This book is a treasure. There are also papers by Lorentz, Poincare' and others. Great fun. But, learn your relativity first!	2002-01-15

They are magnificent in their clarity and succint as only Pauli could be. Basically they explain how to quantize the basic free fields and introduce in a beautiful way the Dyson method of introducing (perturbative) interactions, renormalization comprised. Fine points, like the Gupta-Bleuler method, get a critical and clear treatment. The language is surprisingly modern, with emphasis in vacuum expectation values, kernels, etc. The last chapter treats the Feynman method of path integrals. This must have been one of the very first published reviews of this method: it is done, of course, quite originally. One should read every scrap of paper left by Pauli, a deep and original thinker who expressed himself with unsurpassed clarity, let alone this lovingly produced book.	2002-01-15

I used uncountable times the copy of our library, as the original English edition, in the excellent translation of R. Silvermann, became very hard to find. I put it in the top of the list of books I wanted to buy. Now Dover put it into their catalogue. Great choice. I already ordered my copy!<BR>This is the best book on the Calculus of Variations. It contains, for instance, a wonderful treatment of Noether's theorem, hardly to be surpassed. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is also treated with brilliance and clarity. Gelfand (and Fomin!) developed a style in which the precision of the mathematics does not interfere with the general panorama. The applications are very well selected and perfectly illustrate  the theory. A great book, a great mathematician who can write, a great translator, by less than 10 bucks!	2001-12-28

Pauli starts witn the Fermat principle and soon finds out the Hamilon-Jacobi equation connected to this variational principle: it's the eikonal equation. He proceeds to get a lot of general results in geometrical optics. After that come interference and diffraction; optics from Maxwell theory,crystal and molecular optics.

Einstein delves here into what his theory<BR>actually MEANS. That is, what must we change (if anything...) in our world conception, in the way we think, as a consequence of his immense discovery. Just think that he meddled with time, a concept static since so long that it is registered deep in our DNA: our concept of time goes back to the epoch where our main purpose was to survive the day<BR>(sounds familiar? No, no, it was different! It was permanent. What you experience now is transient...)<BR>So what? Read it! It is a marvellous book. Perhaps you will have to reach for other, more elementary, books, in this enterprise. All right! That almost characterizes a book worth reading. So... go on! It will repay your efforts. It IS doable. You will come out, for instance,  with a precise CONSTRUCTION OF SPACE! Your brains will be enriched.You deserve that!	2001-12-27

It is NOT the book which contains the original works, which is a very difficult book (just think that Planck had to ask for several clarifications before he understood Einstein's breakthrough paper). Here the great scientist set to himself the goal of explaining to the educated, but not specialized, man.<BR>Einstein was, of course, very deep. When he talked about any topic in physics, chances are that he went deeper than anyone else who thought about the same theme, for a comparable time span. Now, imagine relativity. When he wrote this book he had thought about this matter for several decades. Nobody reached this depth, then and afterwards. The fruits of his thought, like black-holes, are being proved true now, after so much time!<BR>So, the difference between this book and all other introductory books on relativity is proportional to the difference between Einstein himself and the other authors. You don't have to believe me: just read the excerpts! You'll not remain indifferent to the majesty of his ideas. Put yourself in the right mood: Einstein was a very simple man who was, in writing this book, sincerely interested in explaining his creation to you. Follow his path, read attentively, and, above all, think!<BR>The reward will be great.	2001-12-24

In it Dirac reviews his modified Hamiltonian formalism, including constraints, so that systems which do not have a proper hamiltonian can be canonically quantized anyway. For Dirac sustains that one only knows how to quantize a system when it has a Hamiltonian. So, if the system doesn't have one, what is a guy to do? He teaches how to generalize the canonical formalism and construct an effective Hamiltonian which is sufficient to do the job. These ideas gave origin to a flow of papers dealing with the matter, and to several good books. Still, Dirac's original lectures are the best introduction, in my opinion. Not to be confused with the famous &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; , the great expository classic. This book I am reviewing is more of a research document.	2001-12-23

Francis Low is an outstanding theoretical physicist who also happens to have an interest in education. He wrote marvellous lectures on quantum scattering, where the misteries of the so-called Sommerfeld radiation condition were clarified (and derived!) by using wave-packets. His name in science was made  mainly by the epoch-making paper, with Gell-Mann, which introduced the now ubiquitous renormalization group. It is noble of him to dedicate some of his time to write his vision of electrodynamics and gravitation, as examples of classical field theory. This is an advanced book, meant to deepen and unify concepts. But Francis Low would'nt stop at that. You'll find fresh views almost at every page, mainly on the electrodynamics part, his turf. Some criticism has been made, by Robert Wald, for instance, about his treatment of gravitation, which is more or less alla Feynman, or alla Schwinger: geometry is discovered. It is not the starting point, like in Einstein. This is also welcome: it puts your mind to work along different tracks. All in all, a great reading.	2001-12-20

Max Born, who knew both, rated Pauli as good as Einstein. I don't agree, but, OK, it's a nice compliment! Anyway, Pauli was really great, and a great writer, in this case far surpassing Einstein. These are his lectures (mostly) on Thermodynamics at the ETH, Zurich, which, by the way, was Einstein's alma mater.<BR>Pauli lectured on all of theoretical phyisics there, for several years. He was revered, and the students carefully took notes of whatever he said and write. These notes were then carefully edited by senior colleagues, like Charles Enz. The result was a slim, compact, wonderful text of Carnot-cycle thermodynamics which has even some originality: the master deemed it necessary to reformulate the treatment of chemical equilibrium (using van't Hoof boxes)to reach his standards of excellence.<BR>This is not a text-book on thermodynamics for beginners: it is a <BR>exquisite booklet to polish your understanding and reveal the great elegance and depth of the thermodynamical formalism and, most importantly, ideas.	2001-12-20

These lectures on quantum mechanics are not the famous Handbuch article which was, for many years, a main reference on QM. These are notes taken by his students (and carefully edited by senior physicists, such as Charles Enz)at his classes. They are much more accessible, being meant for students. Being quite compact, I woulnd't say they are adequate for standard beginning students. They are, however, perfect for clarifying subtle points and have an exquisite elegance, in their simplicity. A friend of mine, an eminent experimentalist, considered it &quot;his bible&quot;. An interesting exercise in style is comparing these lectures with the analogous ones by Fermi, in his Chicago lectures. Who wins? My favorite is Fermi's. But it is a close match.	2001-12-20

This means a lot for me, for I rate very highly all his books, especially &quot;Infinite in All Directions&quot;. Actually, this is one of the best books I ever read, and it influenced me a lot, for instance, in my reading of poetry. It was in this book that I discovered Yeats (recall that I am not a native English speaker). And it gave me the momentum to read, and appreciate in a quite concrete situation, the second part of Goethe's Faust. The episode of Dyson's vacations with mother and father, and the ensuing discussion on humanities vs. science, is very revealing, and helps to pinpoint the origin of the high degree of understanding and tolerance which illuminates all posterior Dyson writings, and that eventually made him win the Templeton Prize. A surprising, very moving chapter on Teller, introduced as a gifted Bach player at the piano is probably closer to the truth than everything else written on the controversial scientist. Wonderful the chapter on how to detect (large) extra-terrestrial civilizations. A book for many, many readings!	2001-02-25

This book is labored on notes taken by students from his lectures on Electrodynamics. This is the book I consult when I am not happy with the explanations in the usual books. If it happens that Pauli touches the subject, I always get what I looked for: conceptual clarity and very good algorithms. Yes, because Pauli, one of the most profound physicists ever, believed that a physicist must calculate. He even &quot;practiced&quot; in his spare time! I especially like, in this book, the derivation of the laws for RLC circuits, rigorously in the field theory way, and absolutely clear and elegant. This is not an introduction to electricity. It is a rather sophisticated introduction to that part of theoretical physics called electrodynamics. In this role, it is certainly among the very best.	2001-02-25

But most are common people who became much more educated and civilized persons by reading his wonderful books. Ortega was one of the rare species of philosophers who expresse his ideas in a very clear prose. Others in this line are Plato and Augustine, or Bertrand Russell, an Ortega contemporary. Meditations on Quixote is a small book where the master strives to give a synthesis of his thought. A synthesis of this synthesis could be given by two of his phrases: &quot;Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia&quot; (I am myself and my circumstance) and &quot; I only offer a way of considering things&quot; (modus res considerandi).

But, in the domain of science, no one better than Gamow lived to it. The great Russian-born physicist, educated by Bohr, reviews the birth of quantum mechanics and its first applications as an insider, with great panache and as much accuracy as is allowed &quot;by complementarity&quot; (which concept, complementarity, he explains brilliantly). He did everything brilliantly. Once, studying, with the great Brazilian theorist Mario Schenberg, ways of very efficient energy dissipation needed in the stars, they proposed that the energy should flow out in the form of neutrinos. This eventually became the well-known URCA model. Gamow named it after a famous casino at Rio de Janeiro, where money dissipated very efficiently too, at the green tables.Gamow is also the originator of the Big-Bang model of the universe, which is called by many &quot;Gamows cosmology&quot;.

Among them, many are of very good quality, describing sectors of science with competence and, sometimes, charm. The books by Gamow, for instance, are notable, as are those by Jeremy Bernstein. Then there are books which not only explain physics to you, but give you tools so that you can, by yourself, understand new things. These are very rare. I can think of two. Cosmology, by Harrison, allows you to derive by yourself consequences of the universe expansion by the trick of moving mirrors, a nice, simple and useful tool. But it is restricted to this rather esoteric corner of science. Then there is Feynmans QED. This is unique. By the clever trick of a clock attached to each photon and by the use of it in combination with his breakthrough idea of summing over all paths, he succeeds in extracting not only the specialized phenomena of high energy physics, but magically renews the good old optics of mirrors and refraction. Using his simple rules you can understand light &quot;like a pro&quot;, and even do your own little research projects. I published papers on quantum field theory, yet, learned quite a bit from this small and precious book.	2001-02-20

Here the author describes the principle of action in quantum physics. It is not a minimum action principle, like in classical mechanics: you can, however,  derive the classical minimum principle from it, in the classical limit. Why is this important? Well, it so happens that the famous gauge field theories could only be quantized under this formalism. Feynman, of course, reformulates everything with his technique, so that the book is very enlightening: it is a rich experience to see well-known things under a different viewpoint. But there are many new things also. The applications are brilliant, covering just about everything: electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, you name it. A new mathematics is introduced by Feynman, a theory of integration in a space whose elements are curves (path integrals). As far as I know, the rigorous theory of this integration does not exist as of now. Undauntedly, Feynman is able to guide us to very important results by using intuitive methods, and checking the validity of a result by obtaining it by two different ways, for instance. Dont miss, by the way, his discussion on the role of rigor (in the mathematical sense) in physics. There is a section on that!	2001-02-19

Get pencil and paper, put yourself in a calm and contemplative mood and patiently read the words of the master. Hermann Weyl, one of the great minds of the 20th century, wrote this book with utmost care to make it self-contained. Sometimes you have to be deep in order to be brief, so the book requires some thought. But the main ideas are all there, and the connection of group theory with quantum mechanics has here its best treatment, in my humble opinion. But in less humble too: this was the only book concerning physics which Enrico Fermi read as a grown up. Once, Max Born had to write a synthetic exposition of Quantum Mechanics. After he finished it, he saw, for the first time, this book, and Weyl's synthesis of QM. He felt depressed by the superiority of Weyls text. The book was originally written in German, but the translation is excellent, due to the great American cosmologist H. P. Robertson, of Robertson-Walker fame.	2001-02-18

For a long time, in antiquity, Homer (meaning both the Iliad and the Odyssey) was the basis of all education. No wonder that these epic poems permeated the whole culture. The magnificent Greek drama &quot;continues&quot;, so to speak, Homer, and looses any meaning without it. So, reading Homer is essential. Not to mention that poetry hardly, if ever, reached again those summits. The episode of Odysseus and Nausicaa is a love story full of nobility and restraint, a beautiful description of the duties and burden of being a king and a princess. And Odysseus, the great hero, weeps in public as he remembers his fallen friends, for a man is not a god, and that distinction was quite crucial, at that time. Feel the tension created by the terrible presence of Athena, who could be, in a party, say, just about every one.  Fagles translation is a joy. I've read The Odyssey in several languages (unfortunately, not Greek), and my preferred one was the French by Victor Berard. Fagles' is as good as that.	2001-02-18

You learn C and, most important, you learn good programming habits and style. The exercises are extremely relevant and, if not exactly easy, are feasible and make you fix the ideas you were exposed to.

My choice was C++. I tried all the standard, highly reputed, books, and was about to give up, when I first met Pratas Primer Plus. And I finally started to learn the language. Incredibly enough, what Ive found in this book, and only in it, is an exposition of C++ which meets the famous &quot;dictum&quot; by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland): &quot;Begin from the beginning. Go on till you reach the end. Then stop.&quot; What the hell is going on with C++ books, which do the opposite, a sort of &quot;Begin from the end&quot;, or almost so? Why even the obviously highly qualified Stroustrup feels the need to give a premature overview of C++ which alienates many, even technically educated, people? Well, now I read Pratas book. I feel confortable with a reasonable subset of the language. I write code which has little to do with the previous code I wrote under C. So, Ive met a few of the criteria used to gauge your expertise (well, thats too much, yet...) in the language and in object oriented programming.

Imagine what if Maxwell's Treatise had been written by himself in collaboration with Martin Gardner and ... Bill Bryson! Paul Nahin is a great writer, and I can only imagine how great a teacher he must be. I will buy every single book he writes. Don't be misled: this is a very serious book, and the pleasure of its reading comes from a very sound teaching philosophy (called top-down by Nahin) combined with a knack for history, which gives context to every topic. Look at the table of contents, and you will see that the author means business.	2001-02-15

Well, Hamming's is also so good! For Fourier analysis, and the taming of the Gibbs phenomenon, go straight to Lanczos. He knew it all, and was one of the inventors  of the fast Fourier transform. This book is in the class of Sommerfeld's &quot;Partial Differential Equations of Physics&quot; and Lighthill's &quot;Fourier Analysis and Generalizaed Functions&quot;. This is a very high compliment. Did you know he  was also a first rate physicist, and a pioneer of quantum mechanics?	2001-02-14

I just learned it. I also learned that Einstein was in awe at the excellence of the lads review of his theory!  Read attentively his exposition of Weyls theory. A few years later Pauli anticipated Yang and Mills in inventing non-abelian gauge theories, a reformulation, in a different context, of Weyls. He didnt publish a single line, but, when Yang presented his theory in a semminar at Princeton, before Pauli and Einstein, he (Pauli) demonstrated a surprising familiarity with the idea. Perhaps you can find some evidence of it in the notes Pauli added to the second edition. After all, this is one of the greatest pleasures of reading classics!	2001-02-14

This book was not written in haste: there is depth in almost every page. Yet, very little is assumed of the reader, but that he has a genuine interest in learning the subject, and patience to read it sequentially, calmly,  and ponder about it. There is, then, no better guide.Do not think you will miss the computation techniques: they are all there. This is a complete book. It will teach you the orthodox view.

Advanced Quantum Mechanics, on the other hand, is quite the opposite. The treatment of field quantization is very intuitive, based on Fermis ideas, and Physics is always kept to the forefront. Calculations (there are plenty of them; this is not a couch book) are very detailed and, alas, must be redone with much attention, for typos are quite frequent. I believe this to be still the book to be recommended for a beginner. She should, after all, know the physics, and be able to do a back-of-envelope estimative of the size of Lamb shift, by Bethes method. The book teaches you that.	2001-02-13

At its time it was written for Feynmans peers. At that time the method developped by him, though he had total control of it, was not complete as far as derivations are concerned. However, each topic was solidly grounded on the basis of specific arguments. This is how things are done. Usually you have a hundred incomplete arguments which, put together, are, so to speak, stronger than a formal demonstration. And, what arguments! What insight this (then) young guy had already!This book is for pleasure! You probably should read it together with some modern text, like Veltmans &quot;Diagrammatica&quot;, to get the modern perspective and also to see how little, after all, was changed. A companion book, called &quot;Theory of Fundamental Processes&quot; is also a sterling lecture, for the same reasons. Perhaps even more so.	2001-02-12

Still, we should not forget that new students keep appearing! Halmos is a wonderful text. Besides the clarity which marks all  of his books, this one has a pleasant characteristic: all concepts are  patiently motivated (in words!) before becoming part of the formalism. It  was written at the time when the author, a distinguished mathematician by  himself, was under the spell of John von Neumann, at Princeton. Perhaps  related to that is the fact that you find surprising, brilliant proofs of  even very well established results ( as, for instance, of the Schwartz  inequality). It has a clear slant to Hilbert space, despite the title, and  the treatment of orthonormal systems and the spectrum theorem is very good.  On the other hand, there is little about linear mappings between vector  spaces of different dimensions, which are crucial for differential  geometry. But this can be found elsewhere. The problems are useful and, in  general, not very difficult. All in all, an important tool for a  mathematical education.	2000-05-26

Still, it is a very good description of the book. Barry Simon calls it  &quot;superb&quot; and recommends that you read it by trying to do the  exercises,  recurring to the text as needed. But then you would perhaps not  pay attention to how wonderful the text is. I believe this is the  best-written modern mathematical text. The proofs are clean and extremely  elegant. The prose itself is beautiful and frequently witty. Treats  topological and uniform spaces at depth and in detail, so as to be both a  textbook and a reference. Excels in both capacities. This is mathematics  close to poetry.	2000-05-24

I know quite a bunch of people who decided to become physicists after reading it. Two interesting aspects should be mentioned. First, it was really written by Infeld, though thoroughly  discussed, in a daily basis, with Einstein.(Infeld was a refugee under  Einstein's protection, and thought he had to justify his temporary shelter  at Princeton by writing something, which would also provide some income!).  Another book by Infeld, &quot;Quest&quot;, an autobiography, is the source  of this and of many other interesting things about that period. Second,  this book introduces very clearly a revolutionary contribution of  Einstein's which is rarely recognized: a new method in physics which  consists in obtaining knowledge from the comparison of observations of the  same physical system obtained by two different observers. Though this had  been done before (by Mach, for instance), it was Einstein who transformed  it into a new tool for science. Physics was transformed by that, and  quantum mechanics could then go even further, in the role given to the  observer. This story is wonderfully told in this book.	2000-05-20

I felt myself included in the category of  &quot;bibliophiles and polyglots&quot;, who collect more books and learn  more languages than they could possibly use. Not that I changed: I just  added guilt to my innocent vices! It adds to the charm that this book was  written in the beginning of the 20th century when, well, wisdom was  different. I wonder how the great scientist would react to the success of  Marie Curie, Rita Levi-Montalcini, Lise Meitner, Countess Ada Lovelace  (whom he could have met) and many other great women of science.	2000-05-13

I hold the opinion that Richard Feynman was the best physics teacher of all times. I keep his three red volumes always at the main position of my bookshelves, aside Dirac's &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; and  the Landau-Lifshitz collection. What is it that puts them in a class apart  from every other introductory text? A Nobel-prize winner, Giaever, I think,  said that he seldom had to reach for other book of physics than Feynman's.  On the other hand, the very respected mathematician Gian Carlo Rota gave it  a bad review, orienting students to go instead to Halliday-Resnick for  help. Perhaps these opposite opinions give us a clue: Feynman's  &quot;Lectures&quot; are the sole book to present basic physics as a living  subject, as real physics, that thing that researchers slowly build in their  day-to-day toil.For the author, as always, strived to rebuild everything  almost from scratch, sometimes with great originality. This explains why we  never grow tired of it. It explains too why it &quot;lacks&quot; the  organization of a text designed solely by pedagogical purposes. It's an  asset, rather than a liability. If you are a beginner, use both (Feynman  and Halliday-Resnick). In Feynman you'll see the magic and understand the  beauty of a career in physics, as in nowhere else.	2000-05-08

Though not a brilliant book like Dicke-Wittke (which sparked at every page and, alas, is out-of-print), it brings the message. Besides the more usual topics, I  particularly liked the treatment of adiabatic processes and the Berry  phase, which is the best I met in textbooks. The exercises are effective,  and vary from routine to tough. I've met at least one which slightly  strains, in its wording, the laws of electromagnetism.

In the beginning there was ether. Then Maxwell discovered his wonderful equations and Einstein, drawing inspiration therefrom, discovered Relativity. There was no longer an ether. Thank God! For, before, every electric, magnetic and optical phenomenon was supposed to be explained by properties of this ubiquitous ether. For a brilliant account of the physics of the ether, read &quot;Aether&quot;, by Maxwell himself, at the Encyclopaedia Britannica (not the present edition: go to*  and look at the Classics). Since Lorentz it became fashionable, and sensible, to, first, derive all properties of the electromagnetic fiel in vacuum, and, then, to introduce matter and the complications which appear (and which give rise to most of the beauty of the world). This wonderful book deals with these complications, and shows the beauties that come out of them. This is a high class text, the reader being supposed to know all of basic physics, including, of course, quantum mechanics. Thermodynamics is used lavishly for static or quasi-static situations, providing depth and cohesion. Did you know that you cannot, in this age of new materials, concoct one with electric permittivity (the familiar epsilon) smaller than one lest you violate the second law of thermodynamics? The chapter on electromagnetic waves is superb, with the best treatment of light dispersion to be found anywhere. Did you know that you cannot produce a transparent material which would disperse light in a different sequence of colours than that of the usual glass prism lest you violate causality? You have to read this book. Grab your copy while you can find it. One never knows.	1998-10-02

I particularly like its chapters on manifolds, Lie  Groups and bundles. Connections on a principal bundle is extremely well  done, with a translation to physics (gauge theories) performed in detail in  an exercise (so to speak). Some time ago David Ruelle said that the  physicists needed a presentation of recent mathematics in the form of  Bourbaki's &quot;Fascicule des resultats&quot;, a synthesis of the subject  with complete definitions, examples and theorems clearly stated, but with  the proofs ommited.

Sometime ago I read  with great pleasure and profit the book with the correspondence of Einstein  and Besso. Besso was a friend of Einstein's from Berne, at the Patent  Service. An engineer, he had enough knowledge to follow (and contribute,  according to Einstein) to the development of Relativity Theory.

Though the highest  points of his book, to my taste, are those of philosophical character, the  author is also a charming narrator. Consider, for instance, the episode  where he marvels at the sight of Ambrosius reading alone &quot;without  moving his lips&quot;!

The  chapter on John Bell, a reference name in quantum mechanics, should be read  by all students of science: how he, who was a particle physicist and  &quot;quantum engineer&quot;, defied the authority of no  less than John  Von Neumann and constructed what Von Neumann had &quot;proved&quot;  impossible.

From it I first learned about Machs Principle, and how it followed right from the concept that motion is relative. The analysis of Newtons pail experiment is astonishing. It is just a combination of powerful ideas, with no equations. Nowadays, when I happen to teach General Relativity, I begin with this analysis by Reichenbach, also because it is one of its conclusions that Newtons gravity theory is inconsistent with motion being relative. At least you have to accept that a moving mass attracts differently than one at rest. This is already extra-Newtonian. Reichenbach, a member of the famous Vienna Circle was a very sharp-minded fellow, and a very clear one too. This book is a must.	1998-08-10

I still reread it, now and then. It is the source of most of the anecdotes that helped to explain, and disseminate, the Fermi style of doing physics. I am particularly fond of the memories of the youth of Laura Fermi, when Enrico was a young &quot;dottore&quot;, and, together with a group of friends, used to hike the Italian Alps at holidays. Everything was used to teach science, or the way of thinking needed in science (for instance, the thermodynamics of the frying pan!). Later you'll find this &quot;physics at the finger tips&quot; approach used to estimate the power emitted at the first nuclear explosion. A great book.	1998-08-10

Read this book and then keep it at bedside for sheer amusement. Analogies are frequently the key to a discovery, but it is rare that this essential step receives credit. Here there is a collection of them: some of the most beautiful. Perhaps the most famous is Bernoulli's solution of the brachistochrone problem, based on an analogy with the path of light in the atmosphere. But there are many others, with comments and analysis by Polya, who spent a life thinking at these things. It's a pity he didn't include Riemann's &quot;proof&quot; of the theorem of conformal representation, based on an analogy with the physics of electrical currents on a surface. The reader can find it beautifully described in Richard Courant's &quot;Dirichlet Principle&quot;.	1998-08-07

The book is full of profound insight on practically anything, even elementary matters, such as the consideration of continuous spectra and the role of mathematics in physics.

It is the complex analysis part which is superb. Titchmarsh is one of those rare authors that manage to motivate the results, get them with rigour and clarity and, especially, select theorems so well that you always find what you need for applications. It's like the famous short table of integrals in the famous, multi-edition, &quot;Handbook of Physics and Chemistry&quot;. It was so wisely made that it was said that when you could not find in it the integral you  needed, you probably went wrong somewhere. So is the venerable Theory of Functions. It is particularly good in asymptotic theorems like Phragmen-Lindelof's, or in the treatment of analytic continuation. But the whole book is a joy! When the Regge Pole theory appeared in particle physics, I published several papers that were not much more than transpositions of results from Titchmarsh to the language of particle physics. So I earned my living f! rom it, for some years.	1998-08-05

It is, of course, known that Academician Naimark was one of the great mathematicians of this century, and also that he was an inspired writer ( his &quot;Normed Rings&quot; is a gem). In this book he shows another talent: that of choosing the right level for practitioners. Very sound mathematics, kept, however, to the strict indispensable minimal. The examples are excellent, along the whole book. He starts from scratch (group definition) and proceeds up to Dynkin diagrams. In the way to this he gives sterling presentations of topology, topological groups and differentiable manifolds. All of them with perfect measure. A landmark.	1998-08-05

The various constructions introduced by Cartan and others, differential forms, connections, even fiber bundles, on the contrary, pose no difficulties: it is only a question of developing the appropriate muscles and reflexes. R. Darling wrote the ideal book to teach connections on a G-bundle (gauge theories, in the nomenclature of physicists), by refraining, as much as possible, to use explicit topology. As physicists are not a special kind of human beings, I believe what I said above is also true of (beginning) mathematicians. Otherwise, why would Darling choose such course (in the navigational sense). The book starts with Cartan calculus in Euclidean space, continues there up to surface theory, then introduces (intrinsic) manifolds. Perhaps the key concept of the book comes next: Vector Bundles. All previous constructions are extended to bundles, and the concept of conn! ections on vector bundles deserves a special chapter. The book ends with Applications to Gauge Field Theory (mathematics-wise, but quite accessible). There are many pedagogical virtues in this much welcome book. Finally a good alternative to Bishop-Goldberg`s &quot;Tensor Calculus on Manifolds&quot;.	1998-08-03

The Relativistic Quantum Field Theory of Charged Particles with Spin One-half (Texts and Monographs in Physics)	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A very elegant text in quantum electrodynamics	The main text of this book appeared in 1955, still under the spell of the great feat of Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman. It was then considered that, in order to retrieve sensible results from the theory, the formalism should be, insofar as possible, explicitly relavistically invariant. This involved talking about space-like surfaces, instead of time (the authors make a concession by talking only of space-like planes !). Explicit representations of Dirac matrices are also avoided. The theory is presented along the lines proposed by Schwinger in his series of papers &quot;The theory of quantized fields&quot;, the utmost in elegance and compactness. Tha action principle gives not only the field equations, but also the conserved charges and, even, the quantization relations. The book is, in consequence, directed to advanced students (very advanced, I would say). Subsequent texts were written in a more relaxed style, choosing a reference system, what provided an explicit ti! me and, most conveniently, a hamiltonian. Jauch-Rohrlich stands as a monument to economy and elegance. It is, in this context, a very well-written book, and a very useful one        too, once you get used to its peculiarities. It is said that Pauli loved this book. Should one say more ?	1998-07-31

This marvellous book of Landau, Lifshitz is the best adult presentation of &quot;classical&quot; classical  mechanics, that is, leaving aside problems of stability, chaos, etc. With this proviso, the book is perfect. It is very short, not by omitting things, but by choosing (and rigidly adhering to it) a very sound philosophy: exploring the connection between symmetries and conservation laws. This explains why the dynamics is based on the action principle, which, as shown by Wigner, is the optimum language for expliciting the discoveries of Emmy Noether. The whole book follows this line, making the exposition very original and, at points, quite surprising (as when the mass is proved to be positive). In my opinion the climax of the book is the theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, along the ideas of Jacobi. I know of no place where this is so admirably done. Simple and beautiful. After learning it, and the applications contained in the book, you can learn the miracles ! Landau and Lifshitz perform with this equation in all areas of physics, particularly in General Relativity.	1998-07-31

For the private life of the great man and for the less formal aspects of his life, the best book is &quot;Atoms in Family&quot;, by his wife, Laura Fermi. Both are remarkable books. The book by Segre, who himself won the Nobel prize for the first observation of the anti-proton, besides being very well written, has some features of his own. First, there is, in an appendix, a series of letters exchanged between Fermi and Persico, another distinguished physicist, of about the same age, which talk mainly of education:which book to use for thermodynamics (Planck), how to study, progresses in some researches, etc. Second, an interview with a friend of Fermi's father, the engineer Amidei, who had a great influence on the education of teenager Fermi, by lending him books he assumed would be important for his future. Among t! hese books is the Mecanique (mechanics) of Poisson, which remained impressed in Fermi's memory forever. The list of these books, with the dates when they were taken and given back, is there. Fermi's style, the simplicity that comes from deep knowledge, is exemplified in many occasions. Perhaps the best story is that of the malfunctioning of Compton's watch; or the first measurement of the power of the first nuclear explosion, made by Fermi by measurind the displacement caused by the shock wave on little scraps of paper released when the first light from the explosion arrived. I read this book at least ten times. I know I will read it again many times.	1998-07-29

The sequence that leads from the very basic concept of spacetime to the computation of the components of Riemann tensor by using forms and the Cartan equations is unparalleled. A lot of mathematical formulas follow from simple reasoning and ... drawings! The introduction of Schild's ladder to motivate the axioms for a (torsionless) connection is very clever. The introduction of curvature by means of geodesic deviation is very intuitive. The derivation of the expression for the geodesic deviation (and, consequently, of the expression for the Riemann tensor) is, again, completely intuitive. The chapter on spinors is very beautiful and useful. Still, I would never recommend this book for a beginner. For it is absolutely non-linear. I have been told that this corresponds to the ideas of Wheeler's concerning learning. Sometimes an argument at chapter 4 (say) depends on something that is intr! oduced in chapter 8. Also, the three tracks (first, second and boxes)interfere all the time, requiring much discipline from the reader.  If, however, you already learned the basics (for instance, in Landau, Lifshitz), so that you know what you are looking for, &quot;Gravitation&quot; is unbeatable, of a class apart. I've seen mathematicians adopting the language introduced by them to explain tensors: a slot for each argument of the multilinear machine!  Last, not the least, the Index and the References are of the highest quality. This shows respect for the readers. Drs. Misner, Thorne and Wheeler are to be congratulated.	1998-07-28

Mandl's &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot;, from the celebrated Manchester Physics Series. These are books especially planned for undergraduates, so that they are not too long and have hints or solutions to almost all the (numerous) exercises. The author is a famous writer in science. He wrote, for instance, the first redable book on quantum electrodynamics (the &quot;Mandl&quot;, as it was called), another volume of the Manchester Series, &quot;Statistical Physics&quot;, one of the present favorite introductions to the same subject (with G. Shaw) and a wonderful Yellow Report from CERN on Symmetries, now unfortunately very hard to find. Mandl has the gift of anticipating doubts and of providing clear and direct answers. In a book of quantum mechanics there are traditional points where disasters frequently occur. One is the description of the continuous spectra, with the &quot;box normalization&quot;. Mandl excells here. Other is the perturbatio! n theory of a degenerate level. Mandl's is the best treatment I've seen. As is usual in texts of this level, there is no Dirac equation. On the other hand, a chapter is devoted to Dirac's formalism, in terms of bras and kets. At the modern side, a very clear explanation of Bell's inequality, and problems connected to it, is given. To sum up, the whole text is sound and very clear. The exercise are good, and the hints most helpful. Excellent text.	1998-07-27

It contains the handwritten notes prepared by Fermi for his lectures at Chicago. They are marvellously organized, with all derivations clearly given, together with the motivations and examples. Sometimes you find a note like that: &quot;Comment  on the relative cosmological abundance of elements&quot;, and you can only imagine what the master would produce. The table of contents of the book is quite usual, and corresponds more or less to a book like Schiff, Merzbacher, etc, with more emphasis on applications. It is one of the best examples of the Fermi mastery of teaching techniques, using simple models, approximations, clever analogies. The book, as one should expect,  contains the best derivation of the &quot;Fermi Golden Rule&quot;, which is a formula for the rate of transitions in first-order, time-dependent perturbation theory. Fermi used to make miracles with this formula. The essential difference between this book and the usual intro! ductory ones is, of course, Fermi. This means that the problems are treated as they really appear in nature, with no idealizations to make things easier. Fermi could do that as no other physicist, as he was the last universalist: there was a time in which it was not unreasonable to say that he was the best theoretician and the best esperimentalist in activity.A similar set of notes about thermodynamics and statistical physics was offered also by the University of Chicago Press.I wonder if they are still available.	1998-07-26

The idea was very successful, and gives birth now to this wonderful volume &quot;Selected Papers of Freeman Dyson&quot;. The Dyson collection is a joy to read (he is a fine writer, both sacred and profane) not only by the quality, but also by the variety of his scientific production (only his scientific works are included). Perhaps you don't know, but, before becoming a physicist, Dyson had made his mark in mathematics, when still a student, to the point that, when he arrived at Cornell to study under Bethe, he was preceded by a recommendation letter written by Littlewood telling that he (Dyson) &quot;is the best mathematician in England&quot;.Accordingly, the first papers of the collection are mathematical. Then comes the series of papers on quantum field theory which made his nam! e in physics. At a comment we learn the circumnstances under which it became possible for him to coalesce into one paper the three extant versions of QED, Schwinger's, Feynman's and Tomonaga's, which looked like different theories. The great paper &quot;The Radiation Theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman&quot; and a set of lecture notes based on it taught the new wisdom in QED to generations of physicists. Concerning physics I think, however, that his greatest work is the series of papers which proved the stability of matter tied by Coulomb interaction, which, besides its enormous intrinsic value, opened a new area of theoretical physics, where &quot;hard analysis&quot; was crucial, and that, perhaps, culminated with the paper of Lieb-Thirring (Lieb writes a beautiful Foreword for the volume). To give you a taste, the Contents include papers on Number Theory, Analysis, Topology, General Mathematics (including a paper beautifully entitled &quot;A Walk Through Ramanujan's!  Garden&quot;), Quantum Electrodynamics, Field Theory (of J! ost-Lehman-Dyson fame), Statistical Mechanics, Random Matrices, Stability of Matter, Gravitation, Variation of the Fundamental Constants (triggered by Dirac's conjecture on the abnormally small size of the gravitational coupling constant), Scattering Theory, General Physics (including &quot;Feynman's Proof of the Maxwell Equations&quot;,by which, alone, I would have bought the book), Engineering and Biology. And, in a comment,  Dyson's medicine against depression: reading Ramanujan's &quot;Notebooks&quot; and trying to prove some of his conjectures. This is a very great book., Either buy it or ferociously fight so that the library nearest to you do it.	1998-07-26

He made important contributions to applications of dispersion relations to particle physics, wrote a book on quantum electrodynamics that was so good that Dyson compared it to Pauli's famous quantum mechanics article in the Handbuch der Physik, invented the famous Thirring model, a two-dimensional quantum field with exact (that is, non perturbative) solutions, and produced, with Elliot Lieb, the best demonstration of the stability of matter.At a point in his career he decided to show his fellows what they were losing by ignoring the modern mathematics. Having lectured in mathematical physics, he published his lecture notes, and, later, transformed them into a book of 4 volumes. The present book is a translation, improvement and fusion of the two first volumes, covering Dynamical Systems, that is advanced mechanics and field theories, meaning electrodynamics, gravitation and a little of classical gauge field t! heory. Having done work qualified as high-class mathematics, he is one of the very few scientists of our day who excelled both in physics and mathematics. The book reflects this virtue. I would venture to say that his personal basic reference was the monumental &quot;Traite d'analyse&quot; by Jean Dieudonne'. Not only is this  the first of his references, but the way of introducing differential manifolds, and, particularly, tangent spaces, is very close to Dieudonne's. Once you learn what Thirring is offering you, you will adopt the new methods. They are much more natural, which, in mathematics, is tantamount to being deeper. And the methods are also much more efficient for calculations. Take this problem: given a (semi-)riemannian metric, compute the components of the curvature tensor (a problem central to general relativity). You can do it by using classical tensors, as most textbooks do (take Weinberg, for instance), or use Cartan structural equations, which use exterior di! fferential forms (asin Thirring). I benchmarked it: for th! e usual metrics, you gain, in speed, a factor 5 (by following Thirring). Still more important, being much shorter, the calculation is much less prone to errors. In this text I especially liked the sections on the Action Principle and the Noether theorem, in the garb of differential forms, which is, no doubt, their natural language.

The philosopher Paul Schilpp directed, for many years, a series of books like this one, each around an eminent scholar. I recall, for instance, those on  Russell and Popper. They started with an intellectual autobiography, followed by articles by specialists both pro and against the protagonist. They all had, it seems, a very high quality. No one surpassed,though, or even equalled, the volume on Einstein. And that because of the absolutely extraordinary quality of his intellectual autobiography, which he insisted in naming his &quot;obituary&quot;. This is one of the great moments of written expression, rivalling Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot;. Is is written in German, and faced, page by page, with a translation by Schilpp. At a certain point, Einstein engages himself in answering the question he  just proposed: &quot;What, precisely, is thinking&quot;. The defense rests.	1998-07-25

This is a great classic, still the best reference for historical matters and conceptual questions on special relativity. As for General Relativity it is good but dated. The astonishing thing is that it was written by Wolfgang Pauli when he was nineteen, in 1921, that is 6 years after the publication of the great Einstein paper Foundations of General Relativity. In the fifties a translation into English appeared, together with many comments by the author. The book is a joy to read, if you already had a good introduction to the subject. Otherwise, it is too &quot;adult&quot;, as Pauli wrote it with his colleagues in mind, not students. I use to consult it when some conceptual problem is the matter. There is, then, no better place. However, as a text, you have now better ones. The mathematical chapters, in particular, became difficult reading, as differential geometry followed different ways from those predicted by the author.	1998-07-25

Eric Temple Bell was a fine mathematician on his own. And he could write, also.&quot;Men of Mathematics&quot; is a great book and probably a perennial one. I read it first almost 50 years ago, in a Spanish translation. I was immediately fascinated. It obviously influenced me, as, later, on the brink of entering the university, I decided to change from medicine to mathematical physics. The chapters had charming titles: the one that talked about Cayley and Sylvester was called Invariant Twins (Gemelos Invariantes); the one on Galois, &quot;Genius and Tragedy&quot;. Now I have the last edition, and the titles are all there. At the time of my first reading the men which impressed me more were Gauss (unforgetable chapter), Riemann (very moving), Galois and, of course, Newton. Recently I read some comments on his chapter on Riemann, considered overly romanticized. Who cares?	1998-07-25

So you'll find Dirac equation, Feynman diagrams, renormalization, Lamb shift, etc. There are hordes of books devoted to that. So what is the difference? The diference is Sakurai. He just couldn't write badly. And here he chose also a very good point of view: avoiding any excess of formalism. The book uses Dirac equations, basic principles of quantum mechanics and relativity, perturbation theory and common sense to derive approximate and accurate descriptions of all phenomena involving photons and electrons, including Lamb shift. You'll learn lots of physics and also Feynman's rules of calculation (the Feynman diagrams). And also a little renormalization. But only a little.

It is certainly the most useful book of mathematics I ever put my hands on. If you read its page of contents, you'll call it prophetic! Every kind of function he studied became important in theoretical physics some time. String theory was started with an amplitude containing only Gamma functions. Renormalization, reborn from the ashes, discovered the Zeta-function (in Whittaker-Watson, for sure), Legendre's less familiar functions were prominent in Regge pole theory (again, the source was Whittaker), and even the Theta functions became important for some field theory skirmishes. You could travel light: Whittaker, Watson, tooth brush, etc. It's not only what there is in it. It's also the fact that it's done better! Consider this: I had once an ugly series to sum up. These were the days before Maple! I couldn't find it anywhere, having looked into immense mathematical tables. I came back to old Whittaker and there it was: in an e! xercise, asking you to prove that the sum of MY series was some function he wrote in all detail! This is Whittaker-Watson.

This is a collection of fundamental papers on quantum electrodynamics, starting from the very first, by Dirac, and going to the paper by G. Kallen showing that at least one of the renormalization constants is infinite (this paper has been called &quot;poetry in quantum field theory&quot;). This is invaluable for the historian, but much more, I think, for the student and, yet more, for the researcher. These days the students learn these things in classroom. This is all right, but it is only in the good pioneering papers that you find the reasons for the choices made, motivations for treating the problem and a full explanation of what is being done and why it would be wrong to follow that other, seemingly much more natural, way. As examples, you'll find here four of the greatest papers by Feynman. If you think Feynman wrote well because you read his popular books, wait till you read his scientific works! There is also the monumental paper by Dyson, where the founding pape! rs of Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman are made to coalesce into the beautiful formulation that, afterwards, was repeated in all textbooks. My favorite paper is the great &quot;On gauge invariance and vacuum polarization&quot;, by Julian Schwinger, a masterpiece of insight, style, and incredible virtuosity, a paper that still gives rise to original research. The preface by Schwinger is a must for understanding the origin and early development of our main tool in theoretical physics: quantum field theory.	1998-07-24

Well, if you are a  beginner at calculus you will not find it &quot;easily understandable&quot;, for that would mean you didn't learn a single new thing! Calculus is perhaps the most profound and far-reaching discovery of the millenium, and is certainly not trivial. However, this magical book is the best possible introduction. It is written so that your perplexities will always be accompanied by so beautiful results or promises of results, that you will be more than ready to do the necessary efforts. These come, for instance, in the form of exercises and in the details of the demonstrations, which are all there. There is no cheating. Well, the book is not only about calculus. There are many previous chapters on theory of numbers, geometry, algebra, topology. But I think it culminates with calculus, and the preceding chapters serve as steps of a staircase leading to it.

Julian Schwinger was one of the greatest minds of our century. He learned, as I heard at one of his semminars, quantum mechanics by himself as he was about fourteen from the horse's mouth, that is, the great book of Dirac, &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot;. One could consider this book as built around Dirac's. It starts by introducing a pre-Dirac notation, symbols which represent measurements. These symbols &quot;factor out&quot; into Dirac's bras and kets when the system is in a pure state. The mathematical properties of these symbols, therefore, follow from the way quantum mechanics describes experiments. The dynamics is introduced through the use of an action principle, soon explicited in terms of continuous transformation groups whose infinitesimal generators include the observables. This action principle turns out to be a differential version of the now popular Feynman action principle, which introduced the concept of path integrals. Schwinger's book is a!  barely explored mine of gold. Most of his ideas are there, waiting for you! I think this is the second most beautiful physics book I ever met. The first, of course, is Dirac's. I think Schwinger would agree with me.	1998-07-24

More precisely, they proved the thermodynamic stability of Coulomb matter. This was a landmark of mathematical physics, and a huge one: a very long and hard paper. A few years later, Elliott Lieb and Walter Thirring substantially improved the great Dyson result, dramatically cutting its length while improving important estimates. A very good review of these results can be find in the volume 4 of Thirring's &quot;A Course in Mathematical Physics&quot;. Even the book version is a bit hard to read, as much mathematical analysis is required. The &quot;Analysis&quot; of Lieb and Loss is a book on analysis which has as a theme the great result of Lieb and Thirring. It is a real book on analysis. The chapters are named &quot;Measure and Integration&quot;, &quot;Lp-spaces&quot;,&quot;The Fourier transform&quot;, &quot;Distributions&quot;, but also &quot;Potential Theory and Coulomb En! ergies&quot; and &quot;Introduction to the Calculus of Variations&quot;, where nothing less than the Thomas-Fermi atom is rigorously studied. In order to leave no doubt that hard analysis is present, there are two chapters on Inequalities. After studying this splendid text the reader will be a better analist and, if he cares to, can start reading the proof of stability of matter.

Goldstein's &quot;Classical Mechanics&quot; appeared at the right time. The development of quantum mechanics demanded familiarity with methods of advanced mechanics that no student of physics had been introduced to. Dirac told in a semminar that he didn't know what a Poisson bracket was, when he was constructing his version ot quantum mechanics (where Poisson brackets play a fundamental role). Heisenberg didn't know matrices, in similar circumstances. Max Born did know these things, and actually wrote a superb book on mechanics using them, but it was in German, at an advanced level and called Mechanics of the Atom. The book then available in English was the formidable Whittaker &quot;Analytical Dynamics&quot;, whose exercises took sometimes a whole page just to be stated! In this panorama, in the fifties, Addison-Wesley published the beautifully produced Goldstein. It was an instant sensation. In the introduction the author candidly confessed that, in his opinion, a cou! rse in mechanics justified itself only as a preparation for quantum mechanics, and that was clearly the slant of the book. It was extremely well written, except for a disastrous chapter on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The exercises were not at the level of the text: you found much better ones in Slater, Frank's &quot;Mechanics&quot;, for instance. The references were excellent, commented, and gave the reader a sense of perspective (and of awe, in the company of men like Riemann, Born, Weber...). I loved the book and hated the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Later on the slim book by Landau, Lifshitz, &quot;Mechanics&quot;, entered the scene and showed that Goldstein's program could be made better, briefer, and that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, clearly and sensibly derived, was the jewel of the crown. Not only, in the subsequent volumes of their Theoretical Physics course, they showed how invaluable this Hamilton-Jacobi was, by applying it with great skill in all kinds of problems.!  Then, finally, it became clear that mechanics was not dead! : the whole affair of stability, chaos, etc, exploded, and it became impossible to consider mechanics just as a ladder to quantum mechanics. So, even the philosophy of the venerable Goldstein had to be forgotten.  Still, Goldstein's Classical Mechanics is alive, possibly now more Classical than Mechanics.	1998-07-24

Soon followed a second, which was, for a long time, the unanimous choice of QM text-book in English. The third introduced things like group theory, a little of what was then called formal scattering theory (Lippman-Schwinger equation), and other new things. Schiff's text was a minimalist one, in the sense that you found everything, but in a very compact, no frills style. A teacher was required. The ratio of words to formulas was quite small. It entirely dominated the panorama. I, studying by myself, tried very hard, but could not understand, for instance, his treatment of perturbation of degenerate levels. Neither could I understand the infamous &quot;box of very large dimensions&quot; where the systems with a continuous spectrum were trapped so that their spectra became discrete. Even less cou! ld I acquire the much desired &quot;global view&quot; of quantum mechanics. I was very unhappy with Schiff. Someone suggested Bohm's textbook for me, but, at that moment, it seemed too leisurely paced for my impatience. Then I hit upon the newly arrived English translation of Landau, Lifshitz, &quot;and all was Light&quot;. Nowadays I think there is no more place for &quot;ole Schiff&quot;, but I must confess some of my colleagues still swear by their second edition, with the famous greenish McGraw-Hill cover.

Max Born was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, a great physicist and a cultivated gentleman.

This book studies every kind of phenomena which puzzled the physicsts of the early century, like thermal equilibrium of radiation, photo-electric effect, the Bohr model of the atom, specific-heat irregularities, cohesion forces among molecules, etc. Then he shows how quantum mechanics correctly describes each one of them. This is done in a pedagogically very effective way: the ideas are explained in the text, while the more formal derivations appear in a large set of appendices. These are gems of precision and concision, precious by themselves. My favorite one is the derivation of the Van der Waals forces (between molecules), which he shows to be essentially quantal, as they are due to the zero-point energy of the ! quantum harmonic oscillator.

Now and then I like to reread this chapter just for fun! After that statistical mechanics of equillibrium is constructed along the lines of Gibbs, starting from the microcanonical distribution, wherefrom the others are derived. Applications then start. Thermodynamical equillibrium in General Relativity is treated, as is gravitational collapse of stars.

For decades everyone looked for Planck's treatise in order to give unity to his or her collection of facts concerning heat, as well as depth to the whole thing. The careful and elegant exposition still satisfies these needs, though the main trends have changed. The purity of the macroscopic approach championed by Planck (in fact a competition against Boltzmann) may seem now an exageration. You will not find interpretations in terms of molecules, for instance. On the other hand, the charm of the purely macroscopic approach is undeniable. After the introductory chapters the reader will notice an emphasis towards chemical equilibrium. This is, in fact, common to almost all thermodynamics texts of that time (Sommerfeld's , for instance) and is due to the fact that one of the main scientific efforts of that time was to try to synthesize ammonia, badly needed for agriculture and explosives (wars were much mo! re frequent then). The problem was eventually solved, for gaseous reagents, by Planck's students Guldberg and Waage and, especially, by Nernst, with the discovery of the third law of thermodynamics. This, by the way, receives a very detailed and interesting treatment  in the last chapter, named The Absolute Value of Entropy. This alone would be worth the reading.	1998-07-23

This is wonderful reading. After it, the reader should be prepared for a beautiful recent discovery by R.

The approach is very concrete, with little mathematics in the beginning. Actually, the mathematics grows with the book in a very natural way. As one would expect, the apotheosis of this great show happens when light waves, that is optics, appears. There is a small kit of quarter plates, polaroids, etc, which permit you to make beautiful observations. The explanation of how Edwin Land hit on the idea of artificial nicols (polaroids) is one of my favorites.

Hermann Weyl was one of the very great mathematicians of this century. He was also a great physicist and an artist with ideas and words. In this book you will find, at a deep level, the philosophy, mathematics and physics of space-time. It appeared soon after Einstein's famous paper on General Relativity, and is, in fact, a magnificent exposition of it, or, rather, of a tentative generalization of it. The mathematical part is of the highest class, striving to put geometry to the forefront. Actually, the book introduced a far-reaching generalization of the theory of connections, with respect to the Levi-Civita theory. It was not a generalization for itself, but motivated by the dream (Einstein's) of including gravitation and electromagnetism in the same (geometrical) theory. The result was gauge theory, which, slightly modified and applied to quantum mechanics resulted in the theory which dominates prese! nt particle physics. Weyl's unified theory was proved wrong by Einstein, and his criticism alone, accepted by Weyl and included in the book, would justify the reading. Though wrong, Weyl's theory is so beautiful that Paul Dirac stated that nature could not afford neglecting such perfection, and that the theory was probably only misplaced. Prophetic words! The philosophic parts are, alas, too much for our present cultural level, but you can ignore them. The mathematical and physical parts are perfectly accessible and, of course, of the highest class. The pity is that the number of misprints is immense, particularly in the formulas, so that the reading is made much more difficult than it should. Also, the English edition is not the latest one.

Tensors are objects whose components transform in some linear and homogeneous way. This is the original definition, by Ricci, the founder of the theory. Today one prefers to define them as the members of some vector space and avoid  talking of components. However, most physicists adhere to the classical formulation. After all this was the tensor calculus known to Einstein! Anyway the job is extremely well done: you end up knowing about parallel transportation and covariant derivative, curvature tensor and several applications. You'll be able to write the Laplacian operator in any corrdinate system whatsoever, and so on. I think the chapter on Integration is much more difficult than the others, but, then, invariant integration is the realm of exterior differential forms, and building them from tensors is inevitably clumsy.	1998-07-21

The former students of the great Russian physicist Lev Landau wrote a text based on his teaching and his papers, as well as on their own work. The result fits well in the magnificent Theoretical Physics course that carries the names of Landau and Lifshitz. There are differences between this text and the western analogues. Dirac equation is derived in a very elegant way using spinors, and the whole algebra of Dirac matrices becomes, in this way, much more natural, particularly, as one would expect, Lorentz invariance. The renormalization problem is treated in a very lucid way. The derivation of the Ward identities is very simple and amusing. High energy limits are treated in the Landau style, and well complements the more formal derivations based on the renormalization group.

Several years ago what could be considered a cruder version of this book circulated widely as a Yellow Report from CERN. It was an admirable text, from which most of us learned how to write the Feynman rules for gauge theories in exotic gauges, and how to renormalize everything by using the dimensional methods. Now comes the book version, polished so that beginners can use it, and with a little more tissue connecting the bones. The Yellow Report was called Diagrammar and became something of a religion. Perusing the book I see no reason why it should not have a comparable success. I particularly admire the graphic derivation of the Ward identities and the (also graphical) treatment of unitarity, very difficult to find antwhere else. The author, Veltman, is a great!  authority in Field Theory and a fantastic teacher.	1998-07-20

I studied it in depth and then taught from it. I don't think there is any book of PHYSICAL quantum mechanics comparable to it, not even the classical Sommerfeld's &quot;Mechanics of Defromable Bodies&quot;. What I like most in this book is the constant use of thermodynamics, allowing the treatment of much more real (and interesting) systems. For instance, it derives quite early conditions for the establishment of atmospheric thermal inversion, a problem of great practical importance in our days. The introduction of the Reynold's number is also superior to any other I've met. Relativistic fluid mechanics receives also a very good treatment, being an excellent preparation for relativistic cosmology. In this book Landau presents his ideas on turbulence, what is called now the Landau-Kolmogoroff turbulence theory. This is being challenged, after recent progresses on deterministic chaos, by different theories, l! ike that of Ruelle-Takens. Still, in order to really enjoy the progresses in this field, you should know both, and the perfect source of information for Landau-Kolmogoroff theory is Landau's book.	1998-07-20

The reader of it who fails to fall in love with electromagnetism would better change his direction of study, as he will not find anything better, including the marvellous Feynman's &quot;Lectures on Physics&quot;. Following a more-or-less historical approach, except for the early use of relativity, the author strives to get the results from a full understanding of the physical situation. This is obtained by the use of very clever intuitive models. After that comes the mathematics, rendered natural and welcome. An outstanding example is the treatment of polarization of a dielectric sphere, where most of the physics is derived from a drawing! Another feature, to be found only in books written by great physicists, is the ability of stretching the argument up to its limit, getting results we wouldn't think possible with so little formalism. Problems are extremely good and real. The drawings, done by the author himself (so I read some! where) are very beautiful and helpful. Some of the exercises are of numerical character, motivating the use of computers. After meeting this book I could never teach introductory electromagnetism from another text. The author, Edward Purcell, is a Nobel prize winner who discovered, among many other things, nuclear magnetic resonance.	1998-07-19

I've lectured from its first edition, and will continue with the second. It is the only book I know which gives you a global picture of special relativity, both theory and methods for solving problems. What I liked most of it is the intense use of the very powerful graphical methods it develops right at the beginning. In this way you solve with two strokes of chalk a problem which would involve lots of algebra, and get a much better understanding of the whole thing. The concepts are introduced in a very careful, if elementary, way, through a deep analysis of simple experiments. The discovery of the correct relativistic form of the momentum, for instance, is particularly enlightening. It is a joy to see how much and how good physics can be done with almost no mathematics. The exercises are also splendid.	1998-07-19

This was not true of the older classics, like Sommerfeld's &quot;Partial Differential Equations of Physics&quot;. Fortunately, there is this beautiful book by Hans Sagan, now on Dover catalogue, to follow that tradition. A highlight is his treatment of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Having previously introduced variational methods, he shows that there is a &quot;Lagrangian&quot; whose &quot;Euler-Lagrange equations&quot; are just the Sturm-Liouville equations. In so doing, he has all the arsenal of approximation methods of variational calculus at his disposal to apply in the so-called special functions. As a beautiful example he estimates the position of the zeros of Bessel functions. The reader will find many other mathematical gems in this fine text.	1998-07-19

Starts with two very good chapters on linear algebra, adapted to the needs of calculus, and then proceeds to introduce you to the contemporary way to do multivariate calculus, including existence theorems connected to completeness. Very thorough treatment of integration, including integration of forms on manifolds, up to the Stokes theorem, built upon a fine chapter on differential manifolds, exterior differential forms, riemannian metrics, etc. Good illustrations and beautiful typesetting add to the joy of reading it. Plenty of exercises and chapters on applications to physics and differential geometry.	1998-07-18

Landau's (and Lifshitz') knack for developing simultaneously the mathematics and the physics of quantum mechanics reaches here unprecedent levels. Both the theory and the applications are masterfully developed. The chapters on angular momentum, with the definitive introduction to, and application of, spinors, the study of symmetry, including a very lucid introduction to group theory, the treatment of the Thomas-Fermi atomic model, of the Periodic Table, the incredible appendix on the so-called special functions... On retrospect I realize I have been reading this book since it first appeared in English, always learning, always delighted with it.	1998-07-18

Kip Thorne wrote a magnificent book. Though I work on this area I learned quite a bit. Particularly outstanding is the description of how the whole thing of Hawking radiation was born, starting from the ideas of the great, ebullient russian physicist Zel'dovich. The analogy Zeldovich found between electromagnetic waves emitted from a conducting rotating sphere and the waves (which should be ) emitted by a rotating black hole is so aptly dercribed taht I had to stop reading to try my hand on its consequences. I told about this  to a former student of mine, then at Brown University, and he eventually produced a paper based on it!	1998-07-18

Perfect for learning something when the time is short! I recalled having learned AC circuits from it, using complex numbers, one day before the exams, and learned it thoroughly (and passed!). Freeman Dyson lists this book as the one from which he learned most of Theoretical Physics. What more could be said?	1998-07-18

This is the latest rendition of the famous Abraham-Becker, which, in turn, descended from the text by Foppl, where Einstein scribbled his doubts. A great book for anyone, though. Crisp, conceptually very sound. Great discussion, and elegant use of the Helmholtz theorem on vector fields (&quot;if you know the Div and the Curl, you know everything&quot;). Very good treatment of relativistic electromagnetism, perhaps the best, very concrete and tied to experiments. Becker was a great science writer. In this Dover edition you get the bonus of Becker's lectures on Quantum Mechanics, very valuable by themselves. I love this book, and have taught from it many times.	1998-07-18

Without trying to be comprehensive, it sheds much light on the basics of the theory, as well as of the mathematics. His discussion of Mach's principle is brilliant, and ends with a proposal of an experiment to test it with satellites! Very good at computations too, boasting tables for computing the curvature tensor  from the metric tensor which are very useful.	1998-07-18

This is one of the best books I ever read. T.D. Lee, a distinguished Nobel prize winner, wrote this book so that bright chinese students could learn both quantum field theory and particle physics with little more than the book itself. It was a great success. The book is practically self contained, starting from classical point dynamics and going up to quantum chromodynamics, Weinberg-Salam, etc., in a very organized and pedagogical way, which doesn't exclude depth and great originality, even in much treaded soil. Don't think it has been superseded. You won't find such a delightful treatment of field theory and its applications anywhere else. This is my absolute favorite.	1998-07-18

I know I will find the essence of the problem clearly yet tersely written. Some highlights: the derivation of the retarded Green function, where a clever mathematical analogy avoids lots of contour integration; the frequent use of the powerful Hamilton-Jacobi equation, again avoiding long Riemannian-geometry computations; the explanation of why nothing, not even light, can escape the attraction of a black hole. When it overlaps with Jackson's rightly famous textbook on Electrodynamics, you'll see the difference between a good (Jackson's) and a remarkable book. Though not up to date in matters of cosmology, it is still the starting point to be recommended.	1998-07-18

Dirac's masterpiece surely needs no reviews, but I dare to write one for younger people. This is it! The first chapter alone would be worth of the price. Wonderful insights, not to be found anywhere else, in almost every page. Supremely elegant, yet natural and self-contained. The whole way of writing physics was transformed by this gem of a book. Learn, at Chapter V, what led Feynman to his version of Quantum Mechanics. Schwinger started here too (at fourteen!). Unparalleled.	1998-07-14

Being a physicist, not a mathematician, I particularly appreciated its self-contained and down-to-earth, though fully rigorous, style. The very good chapter on integration of forms shows mastery of the authors both in the topic and in the technique of exposition. Terse, yet very clear: a rare combination that reminds one of the best books by Halmos.	1998-07-14
