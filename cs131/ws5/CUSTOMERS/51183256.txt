Rider Haggard)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good later yarn by Haggard	Probably many people who have read widely in Haggard's works would agree with C. S. Lewis, who said that Haggard's later books are better written than the earlier ones, but have less mythopoeic power.  My reading of 16 of the novels (so far) bears out the truth of Lewis's comment.  Haggard himself claimed that his best work was done early one (say, King Solomon's Mines, She, Nada the Lily, Allan Quatermain, Eric Brighteyes, etc.) - - although it's been reported that he thought the relatively late Child of Storm was his best single book.  (I don't know of any Haggard readers who would agree with that.) <br /> <br />Anyway, Allan and the Holy Flower proved to be a fine entertainment.  I rate it 3 stars because it isn't on the level of other books by Haggard; but as a \\"good yarn\\" it's well worth reading.	2005-09-05
US	51183256	RF058KHIUSX60	1587151510	165939420	Heu-Heu or the Monster	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Comment from a veteran reader	It's probably fair to say that Haggard did not do anything in this late tale that he hadn't already done, better, in earlier books.  Hence, having read 16 of Haggard's books, several of them more than once, I'd be inclined to urge readers new to Haggard not to start with Heu-Heu; read She.  Haggard's romance She is, on one level, just outstanding pulp-fiction adventure; as a work of the mythopoeic imagination, its peers are masterpieces such as Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Shelley's Frankenstein, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or George MacDonald's Lilith.  Or, if you've become interested in Allan Quatermain thanks to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, start your reading of Haggard with King Solomon's Mines. <br /> <br />Yet after all there is one, admittedly extrinsic, reason why some readers might begin Haggard with Heu-Heu, namely the likelihood that the original movie of King Kong is indebted to it.  I don't want to give away too much about Heu-Heu, so I will just say that readers expecting a climactic battle with a huge monster will not find that in Haggard's book; but the core situation - - the cyclical offering to a monster, on a forbidden island, of a beautiful chained maiden  - - is here in Heu-Heu.  (Haggard's narrator, Allan Quatermain, points to a parallel from Greek Mythology, the story of Andromeda!)  It is certainly possible that someone involved in the creation of the King Kong movie had read Haggard's book, published just a few years before the movie was released, in time to influence the development of the movie.  If your first Haggard romance is Heu-Heu, though, don't suppose that you can judge this great storyteller's achievement by this book... <br /> <br />Two and a half stars out of five.	2005-09-05

The relations are not only economic but historical and of the soul.  Hedges, foxes, cows, cats and herons are some of the animals in the place (rural Wiltshire) of which the author writes; also discussed are children, circus players, and the District Nurse.  One doesn't often come across a book exuding so much probing intelligence and affection.  The intelligence probes realities of rural life, including unappealing ones relating to agribusiness, plastic, cars, signs, sheds, as well as the more appealing ones that draw ever more \\"incomers.\\"  The affection is centered not on abstractions but on specific people, places and things, including the night sky as known from one place on the earth's surface.  The sensibility thus evident is an attractive one. <br /> <br />Some of the book's most interesting passages, for this reader, concerned the rearing of children.  Scruton doesn't seem to have heard of homeschooling, as it has come to be called in the United States; but, if citizens can do this legally in Britain, that seems to be where Scruton's convictions will lead him.  Indeed, he and his wife are obviously already teaching their children, but apparently as a supplement to the pedagogy of a government school or private school.  The next step is recognition that mass education, with honorable exceptions, inculcates dispositions of the heart that are unwholesome, and manifestly fails to discipline and nurture the mind as it should.  If you seek the monument of modern education, look about you.  That's why hundreds of thousands of Americans have undertaken the exodus from the schools; may this freedom spread. <br />	2005-03-23

First, it brings Tolkien's three closest friends (G. B. Smith, R. Q. Gilson, and Christopher Wiseman) into clearer focus than previous accounts have done.  Second, it provides the most full account in print of Tolkien's World War I service.  In that war, Smith and Gilson were killed.  Garth dispels the idea that Tolkien worked on early versions of his Middle-earth fantasy while in the trenches.  &quot;You couldn't write,&quot; Tolkien said.  &quot;You'd be crouching down among flies and filth.&quot;  It was, he said, &quot;animal horror.&quot;  Garth shows that Tolkien grieved for the loss of his friends and needed months to recuperate from the &quot;trench fever&quot; that got him sent home from France, but did not become spiteful and embittered by the brutality of the war, unlike Robert Graves, author of Good-bye To All That.  Although Garth is exceptionally careful, for a modern biographer, about suggesting transferences or transmutations of his subject's experiences into his subject's writing, he guesses that, if not for Tolkien?s wartime experiences, Tolkien might have become known for the writing of relatively insubstantial fantasy in the vein of William Morris.	2004-04-09

(Maybe it will someday -- who knows??)  There's not the slightest indication that he slipped in turning to Hamlet for this one, though.  With the very important difference that Blood and Judgment isn't corny, this thriller about a handful of Minnesotans condemned to live the action of the famous tragedy reminded me a little of one of the better third-season Star Trek episodes, &quot;Spectre of the Gun,&quot; with people caught in a &quot;script&quot; that sentences them to death.  (Remember how the bodies litter the stage at the end of Shakespeare's play?)  There's an apparition, as in the Bard's play, but here it has the form of a child-abusing clergyman.  Lars Walker has not forgotten his saga lore (so evident in Wolf Time and, especially, The Year of the Warrior) for this new novel -- this time, the background for Amlodd, the original Hamlet.  As Lars Walker's readers expect, the fantasy is linked to our &quot;ordinary&quot; world, which is alertly observed and, occasionally, neatly poked by his satire.	2003-12-26

I know of nothing quite like it, though.  A feature I want, at this point, particularly to commend is the way the author has (1) of conveying his delight in, and the meaningfulness of, the music as he has experienced it, while (2) somehow saying enough that this reader, at least, can distinguish between the sure bets and the iffy ones from the reader's own point of view.  Thus I credit Reilly (and the wonderful Samuel Palmer cover art) for putting me on to the Chandos recordings of the symphonies of Edmund Rubbra -- once I bought and listened to a CD of his symphonies 4, 10, &amp; 11, I knew I would want more.  One of Reilly's fine columns in Crisis Magazine put me on to Joly Braga Santos -- sure enough, I enjoyed the work (Symphony #4) praised there, as well.  The Naxos CD of Douglas Lilburn's symphonies is another example.  On the other hand, while Reilly likes Martinu and Nielsen, what he says about these composers conveys important things about their work such that someone like me who is not enchanted would have sufficient warning that this is someone to hear first before buying.  I hope that in a few years there can be a sequel to this book.  In the meantime, I'm glad to have a copy of Surprised by Beauty and to be able to read Mr. Reilly's columns in Crisis.	2003-12-22

But Undset's early novel Jenny shows the Norwegian Nobel Prize winner as the peer of Turgenev. Jenny is worthy of comparison with something like Turgenev's &quot;First Love&quot; as a tale of the loss of youth and of eros (present or absent), but from the point of view of a woman who is not in love, rather than the point of view of the man who is in love.  There is a suggestion, too, of Turgenev's characteristic interest in cultured, somewhat amoral, and vaguely political artist-poet types who have left their northern homelands (for Turgenev, Russia; for Undset, Norway) for southern Europe.  <br />Emphatically Jenny is not to be thought of as a Turgenev imitation, though.  For one thing, Undset's novel deals -- in some of its best pages -- with its heroine's maternal yearnings and grief, something one wouldn't look for in Turgenev.  The Russian had a somewhat effeminate fondness for poetic melancholy (amusing satirized by Dostoevsky in Demons); in Jenny, &quot;might have been&quot; hurts people more.    <br />There are flat patches of descriptive writing -- here, she is no rival of the Turgenev who wrote the lovely outdoors anecdote &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot;  -- and one must admit that one could become impatient with these rootless would-be artists, as one was meant to, I suppose.  In later works, Undset achieved a greater synthesis of romanticism and stern, classical truthfulness.	2003-07-13

He was fostered by Steinfinn Toresson, but his parents were Audun and Cecilia.  Cecilia was daughter of Bjorn Andersson and Lady Margrete, whose first husband was Erik, their children being Erik and Barnim.  Barnim is important to the young Olav Audunsson.<br />Audun was son of Ingolf and Ragna.  Ingolf was one of five children of Olav Olavsson and Astrid Helgesdatter: the others were Helge, Halldis (who married Ivar Staal), Borgny, and Torgils \\"Foulbeard.\\"  Foulbeard, who is still alive when Olav Audunsson is a youth, was foster-brother with Olav Half-Priest.  Foulbeard sired a son, Arne, on a woman named Astrid.  Astrid's brother was Benedikt Besseson.  Arne was the father of Signe, Una, and Torgunn.<br />Olav Olavsson was son of Olav Torgilsson and Tora Ingolfsdatter.  Olav Olavsson's grandfather was Torgils of Dyfrin, a great estate that Olav Audunsson passes in the third novel of the Master of Hestviken quartet.  The axe of the novel's title has passed down to Olav from the Dyfrin days.<br />Astrid Helgesdatter was sister of Ingolf Helgesson.<br />Olav Ingolfsson is an \\"old kinsman\\" of Olav Audunsson's; Ingolfsson's mother was Bergljot of Tveit, and his siblings include Kaare.<br />Olav Ribbung is a great-grandfather of Olav Audunsson.<br />2.INGUNN STEINFINNSDATTER'S ANCESTRY<br />Ingunn and Olav Audunsson become lovers in The Axe, their youthful desires coinciding with an ambiguous betrothal.  Ingunn is one of four children, the others being Tora, Hallvard, and Jon, of Steinfinn and Ingebjorg.  Tora marries Haakon Gautsson, who at one point might have married Ingunn.  Haakon's sister is Helga.<br />Steinfinn is one of five children of Tore of Hov and Aasa.  The others are Ivar, Magnhild, Herdis and Magnus.  <br />Tore of Hov also sired children by his concubine, Borghild: at least two, Ragnhild and Kolbein.  Olav Audunsson will kill one of Kolbein's sons, Einar.  The other is Haftor.  <br />Aasa, Tore's wife, is daughter of Magnus, and her siblings are Hillebjorg and Finn.  Hillebjorg married a man named Finn, and their son was Arnvid, an important person in the lives of Olav and Ingunn.  Arnvid was forced to marry Tordis; their children were Magnus, Funn, and Steinar.<br />If there are any inaccuracies above, I hope they can be set right!  But I think the above is correct.	2003-06-22

British composer Sir John Tavener has drawn on Ephrem for texts of at least three of his compositions, including the superlative &quot;Thunder Entered Her&quot; of 1990.  I included some of Ephrem's verse in a course and after that, students were coming by my office to tell about how moved by or interested in Ephrem, etc. they found themselves to be.  I also recommend Brock's book of translations, HYMNS ON PARADISE.  Buy both, and read them.  They help Christians to contemplate the Mysteries.	2002-10-23

But she also understood us to be souls, present to but distinct from God.  Hence, even though in a few instances Gaskell's facts may been correctible (which the editor has done for us in this Penguin Classics edition), she is concerned with truth, and this gives readers the opportunity (rarely offered by modern entertainments) to escape from the trivial.	2002-08-28

Fierce battles, passionate romance, stirring orations, even scenes of cosmic splendor succeed one another; there's the sense of real genius here, of an artist who is fulfilling his intention.  This translation reads very, very well indeed.  A remarkably satisfying book.  <br />C. S. Lewis relished this epic poem -- see his essay \\"Tasso\\" in his book of essays on medieval and Renaissance literature.  I wonder if Tolkien also had read it, as a number of scenes reminded me of the Siege of Minas Tirith, etc.  For those who want to move on from the authors and works that everyone knows influenced and/or impressed Lewis (and Tolkien?) such  as Chesterton, George MacDonald, et al., Tasso may be recommended.  I wonder if Lewis didn't get the idea for the severed head, of the criminal Alcasan, who seems to speak, but is really manipulated by a devil, and which the heroine of That Hideous Strength sees in a dream, from Tasso, where a Fury from hell makes a severed head talk (deceivingly) in a dream to one of the Christian warriors. The gruesome descriptions are similar, and Lewis even calls Alcasan \\"the Saracen\\"; and Alcasan certainly could be the name of one of the Saracen knights in Tasso.  Who knows...?	2002-07-27

But -- what a lot of frustration, inhospitality, and breakage!  Boats jam, people lie, an heroic expedition to the North is a flop.  You won't find any great romances here, but a number of maidens who would druther not leave home (especially undesirable if the prospective husband is a &quot;nook-haunter&quot; -- an old man).  A suitor might perform all the tasks the girl's mother demands, and after doing the impossible, he doesn't get to marry her even so.  Heroes arrive in a village to be sent on from one house to the next in an unfriendly manner. A quest for fire leads to calamitous accidental conflagrations. Quests don't end in dazzling triumphs; the great quest-object for this epic ends up plopping into the sea and being broken.  This is indeed the epic of the &quot;luckless lands of the North.&quot;<br />Especially powerful are the cantos about that scary young punk Kullervo.  Where else in traditional literature is there such a portrait of a kid born to make everyone miserable before he takes his own life?<br />It's not all dour stuff, to be sure.  There are a number of passages in which the words practically writhe off the page as the lines describe tingling, squirming magical growing.  There's some humor.<br />The work is suffused with an earthy quality.  It's not ambrosia and nectar we have here, but fish to eat, home-brewed beer to drink, and plain bread -- sometimes bulked up with bark -- to chew. People wear wool, navigate fogs, get up early to light fires and milk the cows.<br />It was one of a select few works that C. S. Lewis cited, in his essay &quot;On Science Fiction,&quot; as works that provide additions to life.  Other things that made the list were Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, parts of the Odyssey and of Malory's Morte d'Arthur, Peake's Titus Groan, etc.<br />Interesting list!<br />This translation seemed to me quite readable.	2002-06-23

P. Hartley's THE GO-BETWEEN.  Aside from a few trivialities -- confusion about when to use &quot;might&quot; rather than &quot;may,&quot; the anachronism of having a child punch the air in satisfaction (kids didn't do that before the Eighties or so) -- the author seems to have written an assured story in the mainstream of the modern British novel and that will please many readers.<br />But the title &quot;atonement&quot; must be understood with characteristic ironic modern quotation marks around it.  What readers learn to be the &quot;atoning&quot; action of the book, is not an atonement in the historical sense of this word -- a word with venerable and profound religious meanings that, I suppose, the author and many of his readers are too much people of their time to believe could be true.  So the pleasant sadness with a tinge of irony that the author presumably intended may itself provoke a deeper sadness in readers who regret that such an &quot;atonement&quot; as the book presents is the only kind of atonement really believed, by moderns, to be available.  <br />And so the book is truly clever, but it's not great art.  Many people will consume it with excitement, it will make the rounds of the reading groups, but few people will reread it.	2002-05-06

Let me preface some comments on this fine book with a quotation from the great Lutheran theologian Martin Chemnitz, from pp. 208-9 of vol. 1 of his Examination of the Council of Trent:<br />&quot;This also is certain, that no one should rely on his own wisdom in the interpretation of the Scripture, not even in the clear passages, for it is clearly written in 2 Peter 1:20: 'The Scripture is not a matter of private interpretation.'  And whoever twists the Holy Scripture so that it is understood according to his preconceived opinions does this to his own destruction (2 Peter 3:16).  The best reader of the Scripture, according to Hilary, is one who does not bring the understanding of what is said to the Scripture but who carries it away from the Scripture.   We also gratefully and reverently use the labors of the fathers who by their commentaries have profitably clarified many passages of the Scripture.  And we confess that we are greatly confirmed by the testimonies of the ancient church in the true and sound understanding of the Scripture.  Nor do we approve of it if someone invents for himself a meaning which conflicts with all antiquity, and for which there are clearly no testimonies of the church.&quot;<br />Mathison should have cited this great passage, in The Shape of Sola Scriptura, where he argues that -- just as we are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is not alone, but rather produces good works and spiritual fruit, so the Reformation doctrine of Sola Scriptura means that &quot;our final authority is Scripture alone, but not a Scripture that is alone.&quot;  Scripture, the infallible and inerrant word of God, is &quot;the supreme normative standard [but, please note,] Scripture does not exist in a vacuum.  It was and is given to the Church within the doctrinal context of the apostolic gospel&quot; (p. 259), which is expressed in the regula fidei, the Rule of Faith, in short, in the creeds, and, moreover, was a means whereby the Holy Spirit guidedthe Church in the listing of certain books as the canon of the New Testament.  &quot;In the final analysis, Scripture, the Church, and tradition (understood as the rule of faith) cannot be separated, but their unique attributes and functions can and must be distinguished&quot; (pp. 232-3).  <br />This doctrine, using a term from the writings of Heiko Oberman, Mathison calls Tradition I.  He argues that it was the stance of the early Fathers and the ancient Church, and was the doctrine of Luther and Calvin.  The Church recognizes the authority of the canonical Scriptures, but does not confer authority on the canon (p. 265).  &quot;The Church [and not the Bible somehow by itself] is the instrument through which God makes the truth of His Word known.&quot; Hence, outside the Church - the visible Church - there is no salvation (p. 268).<br />Over against Tradition I are, on the one hand, Tradition II (the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox doctrine that unwritten traditions are a source of supplementary revelation parallel to Scripture) and Tradition III (the Roman Catholic doctrine that the present magisterium and the papacy are, in fact, the source of revelation) -- and, on the other hand, Tradition 0, the prevalent American Protestant view, which disdains creeds and recognizes no authority in the Church for what is to be believed, requiring instead the false ideal of the individual approaching the Bible with a completely open mind, thus supposedly enabling the Holy Spirit to illuminate him.  Mathison does a good job especially of critiquing the Roman Catholic views and &quot;Tradition 0.&quot;  (His material specifically addressed to Orthodox claims is good, but relatively less developed.)<br />A book that should be of great interest to many Christians.	2002-03-02

VILLETTE is something different.  It could be a good bet for a reading group -- there's a lot to discuss in it.  It's a deliberately slow and un-melodramatic story; the narrator, Lucy Snowe, evidently intentionally does _not_ tell about some of the most dramatic incidents in her life,instead focusing on her emotional privation.<br />In this book, it seems there are three levels of humanity.  There is the majority, focused on material dazzle -- who are made of &quot;vulgar materials.&quot;  Superior to them are those whose hearts and minds are capable of some development, but who are spiritually limited.  Lastly there is an elite, who, perhaps through much suffering and the tutelage of the wise, discover their own inner integrity, and so become free even while being bound to the &quot;prison&quot; of the body.  In short -- don't be misled by the Christian terminology; this is a gnostic novel, even if Bronte never heard the term &quot;gnostic.&quot;  <br />It has a tough-mindedness that makes many novels seem sentimental.  And it really is rather bleak, in seeing this world as unredeemable.  For a Victorian fiction with obvious spiritual/religious relevance, what a Christless thing it is.	2002-02-12

Pearce's book meets the need of public and undergraduate libraries for a very readable, concise, and up-to-date biography of this controversial Nobel Prize winner.  Pearce's book includes some otherwise unavailable recent material by Solzhenitsyn -- the prose poems at the end of the book -- so graduate libraries ought to have it, also.<br />Individuals who have read Solzhenitsyn's own autobiographical works and open letters might not need this book, but for most readers it will be a good introduction.  It has the salutary effect of prompting one to go and (re)read works such as The First Circle.  Pearce doesn't go into depth in discussion of Solzhenitsyn's books, but says enough to quicken interest in them.  <br />Pearce shows affinity between Solzhenitsyn's positive ideas and those of people such as E. F. Schumacher (Small Is Beautiful).  The critique of Enlightenment progressivism and positivism isn't detailed, but there's enough to remind me of writers as otherwise diverse as Phillip Sherrard (The Eclipse of Man and Nature), Russell Kirk, and the author of Ideas Have Consequences. I was also reminded a little of C. S. Lewis's prophetic novel That Hideous Strength, where Lewis presents a distinction between Britain and Logres, as I read Solzhenitsyn as quoted by Pearce, on the souls of nations.  Familiarity with these writers -- who are often not known, or well known, to persons who presume to speak of their ideas -- can help one to understand where Solzhenitsyn is coming from.	2002-01-01

There's a father-son element in these pages which is easy to relate to Naipaul's 2000 collection of letters between himself and his own father.<br />Perhaps the meanings that one senses early in the book are pretty much the ones that one ends with.  <br />The book's not much of an advertisement for humanism.  I imagine that Malcolm Muggeridge would have approved of this book for that reason as well as because its prose is so good. When I had finished Half a Life, I found myself thinking it should be compared to another book whose narrative ends in a remote, exotic, and, to the author, unappealing locale -- namely, Evelyn Waugh's famous novel, A Handful of Dust.<br />Naipaul convinces us that Willie Chandran, the protagonist/narrator, has had various sexual experiences, including, in his late thirties or at around forty, ones that give him more physical satisfaction than he had experienced before - - but that they are recognized as a dead end, so that even while Willie is preoccupied with them (his life has become idle), he tells us that a &quot;half-feeling of the inanity of my life grew within me, and with it there came the beginning of respect for the religious outlawing of sexual extremes.&quot;  That isn't something 99 out of a hundred modern novelists would tell you, and most of them wouldn't tell you that, I suppose, because they aren't smart enough and honest enough to do so.  It doesn't seem that Naipaul falls for the line that, in a world ultimately meaningless, the best chance many of us have for an interesting life is a sexually varied one.<BR> <BR>Willie can write, earlier, that he thought &quot;how terrible it would have been if, as could so easily have happened, I had died without knowing this depth of satisfaction, this other person that I had just discovered within myself.  It was worth any price, any consequence.&quot;  That is something that, I believe, many modern writers believe or want to believe, but Naipaul doesn't leave it at that.	2001-11-29

Tolkien, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield and Their Friends	Books	2	53	82	N	N	Not recommended	Not recommended for purchase, especially by academic libraries (this suggestion is from a holder of a 1985 Master of Library Science degree, University of Illinois).  I admit that I'd have really enjoyed browsing in this book when I was a junior high school student, though.  <br />Many readers who know a bit about the Inklings, and, certainly, scholars, will not find the book to be satisfactory, whether as regards style or as regards content.  There are various usage and even spelling errors that should have been caught in the editing process.  There are curious inclusions -- satanist Aleister Crowley? John Macgowan(1726-80), a Baptist minister, who wrote a book the authors think resembles Lewis's The Screwtape Letters -- though they don't think Lewis ever read it?  It's weird to include entries such as these, and then leave out people such as Pauline Baynes, whose artwork won raves from Tolkien (she illustrated three of his books in his lifetime) and Lewis (she illustrated all seven of the Chronicles of Narnia)!  <br />The authors really deserve censure for neglecting to discuss the major controversy in Lewis scholarship of the last fifteen years, the possibility of forgeries being offered as unpublished works by CSL.  No responsible scholar would &quot;stonewall&quot; such an issue! One cannot understand why their bibliography, while listing some items twice, omits some very important books, such as Scull and Hammond's book on Tolkien's artwork, or Charles Williams's Outlines of Romantic Theology.  <br />I wouldn't have bought this book if I'd known how unsatisfactory it would prove to be when I'd got it.	2001-11-29

The children heard stories from relatives and people who worked on the property, and they experienced the changing seasons.  Something important about the formation of a child's inner world is implied.<br /><br />Santayana wrote that one's lifelong sensibility towards beauty depends on early experiences.  \\"Taste is formed in those moments when aesthetic emotion is massive and distinct; preferences then grow conscious, judgments then put into words will reverberate through calmer hours; they will constitute ... habits of perception, secret standards for all other beauties.  A period of life in which such intuitions have been frequent may amass tastes and ideals sufficient for the rest of our days.  Youth in these matters governs maturity . . . Half our standards come from our first masters, and the other half from our first loves.\\"<br /><br />(What kind of imaginative formation do our own children experience?  Is the human voice not rarely a source of stories and memories for them, or do they hardly ever hear it except for instructions and complaints? -- except for the electronically recorded voice.  What do we pass on to them?  What beautiful things are part of their daily lives?)<br /><br />This book is a kind of love story.  It is also a pleasing evocation of childhood perception.  It's somewhat akin, as a family chronicle, to the Little House books (where there is more hardship) or Sergei Aksakov's Russian classic, Years of Childhood -- which is a little-known gem.	2001-07-02

Lewis, Poet: The Legacy of His Poetic Impulse	Books	4	5	6	N	N	30+ pages of unpublished Lewis	Diehard Lewis fans like me, and any academic library with a good Lewis collection, must have this book, because it publishes for the first time a lot of Lewis's adolescent poetry, as well as some later verse.  You could read Lewis's classic autobiography SURPRISED BY JOY and turn to King's book to read the poetry that so absorbed the young devotee of Norse mythology, Wagner, and pessimism.  Another highlight is King's account of Lewis's friendship, in middle age, with the award-winning poet Ruth Pitter, whose work should be better known.  It's King's contention that Lewis's prose writings, particularly PERELANDRA (on which he is especially persuasive) and A GRIEF OBSERVED, manifest Lewis's poetic sensibility -- and so close did Lewis come in the former book to writing poetry, that Pitter was moved to render passages from it into verse.  <br />Most of the book is just a sturdy survey of Lewis's poetry, which at the least shows that Lewis's practice of poetry was lifelong, and points out for the reader CSL's most accomplished works.  King admires short poems found in THE PILGRIM'S REGRESS as well as some meditations on prayer, and verses on other topics, written later.<br />This book should be a contender for the Mythopoeic Society's award for &quot;Inklings&quot; scholarship, if I, a non-member at the moment, may make a suggestion!	2001-06-29

Luther &quot;naturally shared many of the superstitions then current.  No doubt he often ascribed to the activity of the powers of darkness what was due to natural causes,&quot; wrote Ewald Pless in What Luther Says.  Boyd would return such &quot;superstition&quot; to Christianity.  <br />It is regrettable that, after marshaling so much compelling biblical evidence for the existence and activity of a whole intermediate level of beings between God and mankind, Boyd does not recognize that Christ, in His Church, delivers people from bondage to the devil in their baptisms. <br />Boyd's book should provoke much discussion, and I hope that many readers will turn to the Lutheran confessions (The Book of Concord) and other seminal works, where they may find an evangelical and sacramental Christianity that demonstrates alertness to the theme of spiritual conflict that Boyd discusses.	2001-04-10

I certainly won't say that &quot;You don't REALLY like fantasy if you don't like this book.&quot;  However, giving this book a try will help you self-identify, as to whether you want &quot;The same again, please&quot; as a fantasy reader, or, instead, might be ready to explore a new world of the imagination that exploits the freedom inherent in the genre.<br />There's hardly a more slowly-paced book in the language; perhaps the best way to approach it is in the expectation of a long series of vivid, strange scenes.  I hesitate to use the word &quot;surrealistic,&quot; because that often has the connotation of sexual neurosis (real or pretended).  The comparisons with Dickens are apt, but the closest analogue known to me might be Gogol's masterpiece (read it in the delightful Pevear-Volokohonsky translation), DEAD SOULS.  In both books you have the idea of people who live in isolation (the Gormenghasters in various nooks of the Castle and its environs; Gogol's oddities being residents of isolated Russian estates before the abolition of serfdom).  Both authors enjoyed concocting weirdly funny names for characters.  Both authors &quot;withhold&quot; -- Peake keeping the narrative pace so slow that Titus is only 1 1/2 at the end of the book; Gogol keeping us in the dark about Chichikov's scheme.  Both authors have deceptive rogues as main characters (Steerpike, Chichikov).  Both did relish a kind of bizarre vividness.  Finally, Nabokov's little book on Gogol says that the Russian concept of &quot;posholost&quot; is central for Gogol: meaning that something is outwardly impressive or charming, but really is second-rate or worse, is empty, is life-diminishing.  That fits the Gormenghast rituals.  <br />Frankly, if you've never read Gogol's comic masterpiece, you should consider giving that one a try; but if you love fantasy, you ought to look into Peake, too.<br />There are a few places where Peake's imagination doesn't seem engaged: the Keda-Rantel-Braigon thing is not successful.  But that takes up maybe 25 pages at most.	2001-03-06

However, older readers may want to look that up.  The Charlotte Guest version is easily available online, and the version Alan Garner used, the Gwyn Jones version, is in print.	2001-02-08

If I had to whittle my personal library down from its present size (maybe 3000?) to a hundred books, I'm sure I'd still keep this one.  I read these stories now to my children and remember how I loved the stories when I was their age.  When I'm a senior, I'll remember how I shared this book with my kids, as well.	2001-02-08

This is one of the masterpieces.  It is not a perfect book, but it belongs in the company of the greatest, such as<br />The Lord of the Rings  and   The Silmarillion (Tolkien); Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, That Hideous Strength, and  Till We Have Faces (Lewis); The Man Who Was Thursday (Chesterton); A Wizard of Earthsea (Le Guin); The Owl Service (Garner); Titus Groan  and  Gormenghast (Peake)... books of that caliber.<br />Don't miss MacDonald's magnificent tales such as &quot;The Day Boy and the Night Girl&quot; and &quot;The Golden Key.&quot;<br />Read MacDonald's Lilith.

His influence on 19th century literature was immense.  What's more, he still offers good reading.  You might not know it from the typical undergraduate British literature survey text, though, where he is likely to be neglected in favor of writers more fashionable today.<br />I had to read Scott on my own -- fired by the enthusiasm of C. S. Lewis, whose essay on Scott in SELECTED LITERARY ESSAYS is warmly recommended.  The first one I read, Kenilworth, wasn't all that good.  Better were The Antiquary, Redgauntlet, Rob Roy, The Heart of Midlothian, and Waverley.  This novel, The Bride of Lammermoor, is a good one to start with -- being not as long as many of his masterpieces.  I suggest the first-time reader skip to the second chapter and start there.  Be independent!  Find out for yourself why your great-great-great grandparents loved this guy.  If you like a warm-hearted storyteller, you should look into Sir Walter.	2001-01-11

Lewis wrote appreciatively about Haggard (see the book ON STORIES by Lewis).  There's a fond essay on Haggard by Graham Greene, too.<br />I love the way Haggard fits out his story with all sorts of &quot;authentic&quot; details -- lengthy inscriptions in Greek, Latin, and Renaissance English, found on an old piece of pottery passed down for many generations in the Vincey family.  Really gets you in the mood.  Then our heroes head for mysterious Africa -- a continent about which Haggard knew more than many of his contemporaries, having lived there.<br />The story gets more and more fantastic, delightfully indulging in what Edmund Burke called the SUBLIME.  (Hint: if you're writing a paper on SHE, that is a good topic idea.)  I've been reading this book since I was a kid &amp; am reading it again, with much enjoyment, right now.<br />Haggard's metaphysical ideas, though, haven't worn well.  Haggard wrote a sequel about his enchantress, Ayesha, called Wisdom's Daughter.  As C. S. Lewis quipped, If Ayesha really was Wisdom's Daughter, she certainly didn't take after her parent.	2001-01-11

Walker is telling his own story -- and what a storyteller he is -- but his imagination is drawing on a much richer compost than (it seems to me) most authors command.  Walker knows the Icelandic sagas, and has adapted the terse saga style for the modern fantasy reader.  Thus he provides us with a series of memorable supernatural incidents -- pagan gods, werewolves, ghosts -- and battle scenes, but he doesn't &quot;write them up&quot; in pulp magazine style.  You may find yourself going back and reading again some of these scenes, to savor how really eerie or violent they are.  His locales are generally convincing; they do not seem to have been invented by a writer who is making things up as he goes along.  <br />There's human depth here, too.  Walker gets me interested in characters without halting the story for extended patches to &quot;work up&quot; the description of the person.  Here are men and women with blood in their veins.<br />I'm teaching an undergraduate course on modern fantasy.  If I'd known of this book in time to include it in the reading list -- where it would have been in the company of Tolkien, Le Guin, and Peake -- I'd almost certainly have done so.  I would have liked to include an example of really worthwhile swords-and-sorcery fantasy -- and that's what we have here!	2001-01-01

Talk about a book that keeps you up late because you want to read &quot;just a little more&quot; before lights out.<br />I was reminded of several of my favorites -- a word about them in half a second.  But first, I must say I felt the author was writing from his own passion and wisdom!  The book's robust and entertaining.<br />Well, it reminded me a little of Poul Anderson's classic &quot;Unknown&quot; magazine-style novel Three Hearts and Three Lions; Charles Williams's occult thriller War in Heaven; Russell Kirk's stories of the macabre published by the legendary Arkham House -- specifically &quot;The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost,&quot; in Watchers at the Strait Gate; and C. S. Lewis's Arthurian science fiction tale That Hideous Strength.<br />And it reminded me a bit of Stephen King, too.	2000-12-08

They should know that while this is in many respects a fine  book, it is misleading.  I will offer a couple of examples based on my own  specialization, 19th century literature.<br />The two volumes offer 15 pages  on Sir Walter Scott, that is, 1/400th of the whole anthology, or 1/200th of  the second volume. Yet Scott is, arguably, the most influential writer in  English for the 19th century.  No Scott - - no historical novel - - no War  and Peace. The volume's ill-treatment of Scott extends to the selection of  Scott's prose, namely the first chapter of The Heart of Midlothian.  The  story proper does not begin till chapter 2.  I would advise a reader new to  Scott to skip Chapter 1.  What about printing one of Scott's short stories  instead, &quot;The Highland Widow&quot; or &quot;The Two Drovers&quot;? If  an excerpt must be used, what about the climax of Redgauntlet, with the  dismissal of Bonnie Prince Charlie?<br />The editors and/or publishers have  prepared a book they think will _sell lots of copies_.  Be warned that this  has dictated some distortions.  Giving three times the space to Mary  Wollstonecraft as to Scott is an example.  No doubt Wollstonecraft is  important for understanding the currents of sensibility of the age and the  voice that feminists did have; but then, where are the hymns of Charles  Wesley, taken up by innumerable British people?  You need to know something  about them if you are to understand the period.  Leaving them out really  does the reader a disservice. <br />Users of this book get an anthology that  subtly distorts one's picture of the eras through which the selections  move.  Good luck to its users.	2000-09-05

Lewis often like to read about his life and to become vicariously acquainted with his friends, too.  If you want to know about Lewis as Griffiths' friend, read Griffiths' own autobiography (The Golden  String), his contribution to C. S. Lewis at the Breakfast Table, and The  Letters of C. S. Lewis.  (It is much to be hoped that all of their  correspondence that survives will be published.)<br />However, admirers of  Lewis may be advised that these two men profoundly diverged in their  religious thinking.  While Lewis was an apologist for orthodox  Christianity, Griffiths eventually said he could understand Christ only by  means of the Vedanta; that Jesus rejected the God of the Old Testament;  that only a bit of St. John's Gospel attained to the insight of Hindu  &quot;advaitic&quot; mysticism, etc.  For readers whose faith is close to  that of Lewis -- who said he was as dualistic as possible within Christian  theology, meaning preoccupied with good and evil, and aware of God's  warfare with the devil -- this book might have been better titled  &quot;Into the Darkness&quot; of spiritual error.  The book is readable and  informative, presented by a biographer who wishes to promote Griffiths'  &quot;deep ecumenism.&quot;	2000-06-27

When he met Blake, Palmer confessed that he set about creating works of art &quot;with fear  and trembling.&quot;  &quot;Then you'll do,&quot; Blake said.<br />Harrison's  book contains what look to me like superb reproductions, admittedly small,  of early masterpieces such as the suite of six pictures that includes  &quot;Early Morning.&quot;  Here also are some of the less distinctive  landscapes of his long period (pictures from Italy, etc.); and magnificent  etchings from late in his life.<br />Geoffrey Grigson's Samuel Palmer: The  Visionary Years remains, in my opinion, the best first book to read about  Palmer, but the reproductions in Harrison's book are much better and, in  any event, Grigson is out of print.	2000-06-19

That is, he brings out the side of STC that he  believes will win him to a modern reader -- such as Coleridge's anguished  sexuality -- while putting in the shadow the man's religious writings.  In  a 900-page book, Holmes gives about two pages to one of STC's major  life-works, AIDS TO REFLECTION, a metaphysical-religious tome, and a mere  paragraph to his last book, ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND STATE.   Holmes is much more interested, it appears, in the possibility that  Coleridge saw the woman he loved in bed with Wordsworth -- something STC  himself said he knew was just a &quot;phantasm&quot; of his mind.  Thus,  Holmes's two-volume biography is more readable than it is judicious.	2000-06-13

In his later years in Shoreham, his  artwork is more Tolkienian than Paradisal.  See if you don't think some of  these pictures are visual correlates of Tolkien's descriptions.
