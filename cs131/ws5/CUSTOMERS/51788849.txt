There seems to be a rampant boycott going on about this novel, but I must say I find it ridiculous. All the naysayers are calling this book boring and the author racist.<br />Come on!<br />The book is set in the summer of 1970, and it should be noted that the social climate is captured with pitch-perfect ear. Harriet is a very well developed character and on her back she carries the whole weight of this engrossing, captivating and mysterious narrative, populated by eccentric characters and bizarre situations. Through her eyes we see how life can change in the blink of an eye. The horror of discovering the truth beneath the lies we have come to believe staunchly results in a chilling climax.<br />Maybe I will be stoned by all the readers who don't like this book or don't get it. Anyhow, Donna Tartt's voice resounds long after closing the final pages. And it does what not many novels can: it can make you laugh and shudder sometimes in the same chapter, and that IS the purpose of the novel: it transports you to a place you had not been before, to the skin of someone else, and for a moment, you are Harriet Cleves Dufresnes and live through her, the darkest, most significant summer of her life.	2002-11-16

Hampstead, Connecticut, is almost like a sister community to [the also fictional but] heavenly Stepford: gracious homes, genteel people, all the happiness money can buy.<br />Then, on the afternoon of saturday, May 17,  1980, a local housewife, Susan &quot;Stony&quot; Baxter Friedgood gets  horribly murdered meanwhile her emotional cripple of a husband witness an  accident at a Secret Chemical plant and -- literally, but methodically- all  hell breaks loose, or rather comes to settle, on the perfectly manicured  lawns and beautiful, restored colonial houses on tree-lined streets.<br />This  is one of Straub's most ambitious horror novels... perhaps even more so  than Ghost Story, although the villainess there is quite simply one of the  most memorable characters ever created. But nevertheless, it breaks all the  boundaries of where his work had gone before, or would go later.<br />The main  characters are people who live and breathe and slowly move into your heart  and touch you in ways that surprise you: Take Graham Williams, writer and  demon-chaser, who has battled his very own private horrors for ages;  adorable Patsy Tayler McCloud, sensible and sweet, but also catalyst to  ever so much power just waiting to be used. Tabby Smithfield, a boy who  would go anywhere just to be loved, at least a little; and Richard Allbee,  a man who is always trying consciously and un- to scape himself and his  child-actor past and who has returned to his hometown after 12 years in  London, along with his beautiful and very pregnant wife, the kindly and  very human Laura, to face his destiny and future.<br />Follow these characters  and a few others that you won't be able to forget either (like Ulick Byrne,  Sarah Spry, Wren Van Horne, Clark, Monty and Jean Smithfield, Les McCloud  and the aforementioned, pivotal, and deeply moving Laura Allbee -- who  evokes all the strenght and vulnerability of another memorable pregnant  heroine, Rosemary Woodhouse, whom all of you surely know from a certain  famous modern gothic) through a landscape that slowly but imminently shifts  from a suburban paradise into a breeding ground for nightmares.<br />Ira Levin  meets Henry James and Lovecraft?

One summer day, Julia Lofting buys a lovely home in a quiet street on the fashionable borough of Kensington, in London. This is the first house she sees, so it's rather hasty, isn't it? However, who could blame her?<br />In  Julia Lofting, Straub gives the first foray on the exquisite architecture  of characters that has been a trademark of his craft. Julia, in a way,  opens the path for other memorable Straub women, like Alma Mobley (in  &quot;Ghost Story&quot;), Laura Allbee and Patsy McCloud (in &quot;Floating  Dragon&quot;), Sarah Spence (in &quot;Mystery&quot;) and more clearly, Nora  Chancel (of &quot;The Hellfire Club&quot;), who in more ways than one seems  a sister entity to Julia.<br />Too wealthy for her own good, Julia is a  troubled soul who seems to solve every situation by fleeing. She fled  America for England, then she fled an unbearable freedom for marriage to  charismatic yet voracious Magnus Lofting, a barrister with a name but no  money and a few secrets in his past, then, she fled in tragedy and grief  that marriage and an unhappy household in search for solace and the freedom  she shunned, but in this lovely Georgian house, Julia finds she won't be  able to run anymore, but rather will have to face multiple ghosts, from  within and from the past.<br />Perfectly written, well settled, with an  unforgettable climax, &quot;Julia&quot; is Straub's first foray into the  supernatural and it suceeds where other novels merely tried. The elements  of melodrama and grand-guignol, which seem like recquirements for stories  of this type, are schewed and in exchange, Straub follows the rule of the  classic gothic novel (all the narrative elements are there, including the  heroine, the castle and the ghost)-- including the obsessive fact that the  past will become ever more important than the present itself, leading to  the atmosphere of ominous angst that is one of the best effects of this  memorable novel, that was first published in 1975.<br />Definitely a novel  worth reading; inspiring, haunting, and in more ways than one,  unforgettable.a novel  worth reading; inspiring, haunting, and in more ways than one,  unforgettable.	2000-07-16

It set the pace for what was to be a marvelous career, including several other novels, such as &quot;Cold Moon Over  Babylon&quot;, &quot;The Elementals&quot;, &quot;Katie&quot;, &quot;Gilded  Needles&quot; and the successful serial novel &quot;Blackwater&quot;, to  which Stephen King gives credit as his main inspiration for the &quot;Green  Mile&quot; series.<br />Also, as a footnote, Michael McDowell was the creator  of the screenplay and characters of the hugely successful  &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; movie.<br />Set in the summer of 1965, at the dawn of  the Vietnam war, this is the haunting story of a sleepy southern town  called Pine Cone, and what went on there... After her husband is the  casualty of a bizarre accident, young Sarah Howell slowly comes to realize  that her strange, treacherous mother-in-law, is somehow behind an infernal  plan of revenge.<br />Slowly, as a pendant in a gold chain passes from hand to  hand, citizens of the town begin to die in horrid, violent ways. What is  behind this? What leads a loving mother to set her children and home on  fire? A dutiful policeman to turn against his wife? A friend against the  other?... as the body count rises, Sarah must run against time to stop the  accursed amulet... but slowly it seems to be finding her way to  her.<br />Michael McDowell passed away on December 27, 1999. He was a lecturer  at Tufts college, a Harvard Graduate and a Brandeis Ph.D... He will be  sorely missed on account of his books, wickedly funny, consistently written  and beautifully plotted. His characters stay with the reader even long  after finishing the book. It's too bad he has been overlooked by many a  horror and literature fan, for this si the real stuff...

The blonde goddess with the silversweet smile and figure that drove the world crazy is brought back to you courtesy of that unbelievably prolific author  of the American novel. <br />Joyce Carol Oates' BLONDE is a tour-de-force that  attempts to take us inside the head of the actress who suffered the slings  and arrows of Hollywood life in full view of the postwar public who  alternately adored and reviled her.        <br />This treatment, a novelistic  approach to the celebrity biography, takes us inside the great star and  spends its first pages laying out the reality of life with a crazy mother,  living close to the poverty level --- immediately, we feel for this girl.  Granted, anybody who has read any of the many other tomes on Monroe's life  will find this familiar territory. <br />However, the introspective aspect of  this inner monologue going on inside the girl's head, the honesty of what  Oates contemplates were Monroe's feelings about her lovers, husbands,  friends and associates, makes BLONDE something we haven't exactly read  before. It is like Maguire's WICKED, a more contemporary telling of an old  fairy tale.        <br />MM's life is the stuff of American legend and, as she  has done with the Kennedys (read Black water -1992) and serial killers,  Oates mines this territory with great confidence and elán. In the hands of  a lesser writer, this would be a lurid and awful book. But Ms. Oates  understands the importance of the confessional element of the book and how  it fits into our therapy-honesty-obsessed culture (Marilyn meets Sylvia  Plath, in a way). <br />Although excruciatingly long for most readers, the  book is compelling --- but what did you expect from the ripe mind of our  most hardworking novelist? BLONDE is a book about the ageless story of a  starlet who was martyred by the town that created her in order to make  money. How much more American can you make a story?	2000-04-23

Why?  Because in this novel, Joyce Carol Oates (author of such fabulous novels as  &quot;Bellefleur&quot;, &quot;Them&quot;, &quot;Expensive People&quot; and  &quot;My Heart laid bare&quot;) paints a portrait that is painful and  disturbing to see... in here Marilyn Monroe not as Mailer's Goddess, but as  a woman who was a victim of herself and of the greed of others.<br />This is  one of the best novels I've read in years.

Fans who think they may know it all about Marilyn Monroe possibly should avoid this book.... they take no notion of the exemplary career of Miss Oates.<br />As a reader, you have to make up your own mind, but this book is nothing less than a most breathtaking Epic (in scale) effort of modern fiction, and no one can dispute that with any other argument....	2000-04-20

There will always be a kind of  woman whom we will come to know as &quot;The Stepford Wife&quot;.<br />The  much-commented ending in this story is managed with such subtlety by the  author, (after a taut, panic-laden sequence much similar to the one in Part  Two of &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot;)that you have to read very carefully,  for it will leave you devastated once you realise all it implies.<br />In  short, a must read for both horror fans and dedicated readers.	2000-04-15

Obviously, the context, perception and objective are completely  different. There is no dazzled look or desperate quest for answers as in  other (male) writers books.<br />&quot;Blonde&quot; is grand in scope, in  feeling, in rythm. Once it picks up, it does not let go. Nothing short of  brilliant, it is a majestic novel that deserves a place amongst the modern  classics of literature and yes, it is also a work of passion that is so far  away from the grasp of the common readers.<br />This is a NOVEL, not a  BIOGRAPHY... and should be read that way... a murder mystery told from the  point of view of the victim? A Hollywood chronicle seen from both sides of  the screen? A gothic romance between a maiden and her doom? Yes, it is all  of that... and so much more.<br />If Ms. Oates returns after almost 20 years  to the best seller lists, then it may be a warm welcome. If not, she  probably won't care.

But I think  that if this actress decided to put distance between her and the author of  the book, my, she must have had powerful reasons and this book is one of  them for sure. It's so pat it's realy offensive.	2000-03-21

After &quot;Blood Rubies&quot;, Michael McDowell presented this, the second [and last]of the &quot;Axel Young&quot; novels, which were parodies of the suspense thrillers created by the likes of Sidney Sheldon and which  were so in vogue in the early 80s.<br />In this, he creates the evil and  greedy Louise, (you just can imagine Joan Collins pulling it off  flawlessly)who won't stop at nothing to achieve her dreams of financial  security, even marrying and then killing an old millionaire, and then  playing musical beds with his lawyer.<br />Enter the three children, Verity,  Jonathan and Cassandra, who will have to choose between saving their family  inheritance or just saving their lives.<br />Total, all-out camp in the most  Johnwateresque style, with a memorable punk-rock subplot and lots of the  tepid themes that made Jackie Susann a classic (drugs, sex, tacky dialogue  and cheesy settings) served with hardly a straight face, makes this book a  real hoot (and a real find).<br />A book to read for leisure and revel on the  many talents of his author (also responsible, as McDowell for such great  horror books as &quot;Katie&quot; and the &quot;Blackwater&quot;  chronicles, and as &quot;Nathan Aldyne&quot; for the estupendous  &quot;Provincetown Murder Mysteries&quot; -- Cobalt, Canary, Teal, and  Vermilion-) who has earned a cult status and, sadly, doesn't seem to be in  print anymore.<br />Let yourself be hooked... you won't regret it! And if you  can, make it a double feature with anything else he has written.	2000-01-14

Disch in collaboration with James M. Cain became a full-fledged  &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; send-up.<br />All the ingredients for a tasty  dish are here: the (apparently) ludicrous plot, unbelievable settings,  facetious characters, disco dancin', nuns, mayhem, drugs, murder, bedlam,  more nuns, turgid passions, sex, even more nuns... and in the middle of it,  a pair of twins  (Katherine and Andrea) who coudn't be more different, and  yet more alike.<br />I recommend this book to have fun, and think that the  author must have had really a grand old time writing this campy, colorful  romp, (originally published in 1982) for it is actually quite good and the  ending (if protracted) is no less a stunner.<br />Also recommended is Young's  follow-up &quot;Wicked Stepmother&quot;.	2000-01-14

With crisp, edgy writing, funny lines and  characters one can't help but care for, Kit Craig (pen name for  cult-favorite horror/Sci-Fi writer Kit Reed -- &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;,  &quot;cry of the Daughter&quot;, &quot;Catholic Girls&quot;-)creates a  roller coaster of suspense without the formula that has made such authors  as Sidney Sheldon, Mary Higgins Clark and Iris Johansen so  commonplace.<br />Here, you never know what's going to happen next... and it  is all great fun!	2000-01-07

Certainly, when the very first  dark and disturbing passages appear nothing prepares you to see the horror  that evolves in the pages of this slim novel which spirals towards one of  modern fictions' most haunting (though non-violent) finales.<br />Addictive?  Certainly! This is a good way to start on Carroll as any other... a  fast-paced nightmare full of tender moments and humor, and insight. Miranda  comes forth as a facetious, complicated and utterly unforgettable  character, made (perhaps unconciously) to suit Calista Flockhart  perfectly.<br />A novel that will please horror mavens and novel addicts  alike, whom will want to read, re-read, and treasure it for a long time.	2000-01-03

Its only problem  (in the eyes of the readers, I think) is that it lacks blood and gore and  though it has an erotic undercurrent it also lacks sex, which is what most  people associate with horror.<br />Cora's pilgrimage (so to speak) is actually  a horrifying experience. Her life will NEVER be the same and that is what  horror stands for: the utter, abrupt and irreversible change in our lives  against our wills is what we fear the most. Ms. Arensberg creates a  palpably (if slow-paced) atmospheric story, that uncoils in utter  horror.<br />Nowadays a &quot;good&quot; horror novel must deal with vampires  and/or killers, with lots of gore and smut... this on the other hand is a  novel, and it is a supernatural horror odyssey too well crafted. Pity for  those who couldn't get the point at all. It's like never knowing the  difference between champagne and cheap fizz.	2000-01-03

It captures the sense of dread that permeates the movie and also, it gives some insight  on the motivations of Somerset and Mills... but surprisingly, the  motivations of John Doe (The murderer) come across as too easy and  bland.<br />Still, as far as film novelizations go, this one is actually quite  good and satisfying... and can be read without thinking of the film at all,  which gives it a strenght of its own.	1999-12-30

The story of Tom Ripley's trip to Italy and what he did there stands alongside some of the most hair-raising and well written novels of all time.<br />Discarded by several as &quot;pulp&quot; when it was first  published in the 50s, this novel has many layers to it, revealing each time  one reads it, more insight and quirky turns on the personality of Tom  Ripley which are there from the very beginnig, just too well  disguised.<br />The beautiful european settings, just add a sense of sinister  foreboding to the story as it unfolds... the haunting acts of unspeakable  violence Tom is driven to, are a notorious counterpoint to the sunny  Mongibello and romantic Venice.<br />Marge Sherwood comes across as a most  interesting character, ambiguous yet passionate and an excellent nemesis to  the young and talented (yet terribly scared) Mr. Ripley.<br />A novel that  delivers and surprises.	1999-12-28

And yes we have as much right as the Trekkies, to have our Ally books... but this being the official guide, you'd expect something else, something beyond the average.<br />I think the summaries made by fans  are much better than those presented in this book, for starters; they are  spare and those of the end of the second season seem rushed, as if they  couldn't wait to finish the book properly.<br />High points? the interviews  with Gil Bellows, Jane Krakowski, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Lisa Nicole  Carson, Portia DeRossi, Lucy Liu, Vonda Shepard, et al. It's an insight, if  not overtly deep on the talented players that weekly pull off the magic  trick from their respective hats. Just one complaint on this area: where's  Calista?<br />On the other hand, the interview with David E. Kelley seems  more like a rehash of everything that has been said about how the shiow  came to be and there is no novelty there, to be appreciated.<br />The color  pictures are actually video captures, and sometimes they suffer the strain  of being translated to print.<br />All in all, a very, but very, very nice  book to have, but so bland and superficial altogether that one gets the  feeling of something amiss... and this probes that most  &quot;official&quot; things (either be books or websites) are not exactly  the best sources of information for fans.	1999-12-11

A fantastic look inside the head of one of the world's biggest mysteries! And the guide is none other than the man himself.<br />Under the platinum fright-wig, there was a swiss-made machinery that went on 24/7. This is a  description of Andy's last 9 years. At times funny and piquant, at others  annoying, it offers the closest thing to an autobiography there ever will  be about both man &amp; myth.<br />A veritable who's who and who's what (and  where) of this era is there in vivid detail. From the '54 days, to Bianca  and Mick's ugly split, John Lennon's murder which left Warhol aghast, to  Truman Capote's passing which made him cry. Phone chats with First Ladies  and litterbugs, crushes on rock stars, celebrity weddings and celebrity  parties, taxi bills (oh, how he kept track of money!), loneliness in crowds  and funny, catty comment on friends and foes alike with the deadpan charm  that was his trademark.<br />This is a most precious document on pop culture  and history, as seen through the eyes and lenses of a man who was gifted  with talent and was virtuous enough to be totally observant.<br />Read it and  keep it forever!	1999-12-11

Is it a vicious scheme to drive his fragile and stubborn dad out of his wits? Is this a revenge  from beyond the grave?<br />In the grand gothic tradition of James' &quot;Turn  of the Screw&quot;, the fine line between reality and nightmare is blurred,  and soon enough the reader is trapped in a downward spiral that picks up  speed to collide in a shocking, eye-widening and unforgettable  conclusion.<br />A must read for the horror fan.	1999-12-04

Both were born poor and were  destined to come unto money, though one was to inherit, the other to steal  it. Katie is what you would call a monster. Pretty to look out, but you  wouldn't want her to look into you.<br />On the other hand, Philo is a  heroine in the old-fashioned sense of the word, browbeaten, put-upon and  constantly humiliated, yet always optimistic and resourceful, not to  mention lovable, she is acharacter one roots for from the start.<br />Gruesome  in some details, yes, &quot;Katie&quot; is also an engrossing read,  evocative, well-researched and written, composed with a sense of [very  dark] humor and a prodigious sense of wonder, this is a novel to be sought,  found, and treasured forever.<br />An unsung classic by an obscure yet  marvelous writer.	1999-10-16

But it seems, this cannot be.<br />Also, this book offers  wisdom in many forms, including a quote that may very well make its way to  the core of modern philosophy, as said by Marian: &quot;Art and  psychoanalysis give shape and meaning to life and that is why we adore  them, yet life as it is lived has no shape nor meaning, and that is what i  am experiencing just now.&quot;<br />Definitely a novel to be read many times  and to be kept at hand for a long time to come.	1999-07-24
