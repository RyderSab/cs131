British poet Christopher Logue has been working on his \\"account\\" of Homer's Iliad since the early 1960s, and I've long feared he might not live to complete it, especially when you consider how long it takes him to write.  \\"War Music,\\" published in 1962, was the first piece he released, covering Book 16 of the Iliad.  Over forty years later, and he's only covered Books 1-6 and 17-19.  But now we have Cold Calls, which covers Books 7-8, and is apparently the penultimate chapter.  According to his publisher, Logue is even now working on the final (!) volume of War Music.<br /><br />Logue's installments have been released years (even decades) apart from one another, but the day will come when they are placed together, in order, in one volume, and they will provide a seamless read.  Logue has lost none of his masterful touch.  If anything, he's improved with age; there should be no fears that the decades separating each chapter of this work might spoil its impact.  In fact,  Cold Calls contains some of the best lines Logue's written.  Here's one such example, as Zeus speaks to Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena:<br /><br />\\"Darlings,\\" He said,<br /><br />\\"You know that being a god means being blamed.<br /><br />Do this - no good.  Do that - the same.  The answer is:<br /><br />Avoid humanity.<br /><br />  Remember - I am God.<br /><br />I see the bigger picture.\\"<br /><br />Like the earlier \\"All Day Permanent Red,\\" Cold Calls is filled with harrowing combat scenes, but also contains a healthy amount of squabbling amongst the gods, including a hilarious song Hera and Athena sing about Aphrodite that's too vulgar to recount.  Only here, in Logue's fabulous Iliad, will you find Aphrodite calling Hera a \\"blubber-bummed wife\\" with \\"gobstopper nipples,\\" and Athena an \\"undercurved preceptatrix.\\"  Only here will you find this same goddess appearing in \\"grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold\\" and \\"snakeskin flip-flops,\\" and referred to as \\"Our Lady of the Thong.\\"  Only here will you find Athena screaming for the blood of Troy from a decapitated Greek head.<br /><br />Special mention must be made of the sequence in which Aphrodite, injured by the Athena-empowered Diomedes, goes to the river-god Scamander for aid.  Homer hinted at the erotic overtones here, but Logue highlights them, with an over-eager Scamander screaming in lust for Aphrodite's \\"bum\\" as she steps into him.  It's not only a comical sequence, but also one of the best written in Logue's Iliad.  But then, as expected, Cold Calls is filled with Logue's excellent writing.  Here's another of my favorite sections, and another example of how Logue's \\"account\\" of the Iliad excels over your standard, dry translations:<br /><br />Around the tower 1000 Greeks, 1000 Ilians; amid their<br /><br />  swirl,<br /><br />His green hair dressed in braids, each braid<br /><br />Tipped with a little silver bell, note<br /><br />Nyro of Simi - the handsomest of all the Greeks, save A.<br /><br />  The trouble was, he had no fight.  He dashed from fight to<br /><br />  fight,<br /><br />Struck a quick blow, then dashed straight out again.<br /><br />Save that this time he caught,<br /><br />As Prince Aeneas caught his breath,<br /><br />That Prince's eye; who blocked his dash,<br /><br />And as lord Panda waved and walked away,<br /><br />Took his head off his spine with a backhand slice -<br /><br />Beautiful stuff...straight from the blade...<br /><br />  Still, as it was a special head,<br /><br />Mowgag, Aeneas' minder -<br /><br />Bright as a box of rocks, but musical -<br /><br />Spiked it, then hoisted it, and twizzling the pole<br /><br />Beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,<br /><br />Marched to the chingaling of its tinklers,<br /><br />A majorette, towards the Greeks, the tower.<br /><br />Yet more proof that a nonstandard approach to this ancient poem can produce fantastic results.  I hope Logue finishes his decades-long work, and one day we have the complete WarMusic in one volume.	2005-09-15
US	52938460	R1IAGSGQQMUW76	1401200192	938608250	The Invisibles Vol. 7: The Invisible Kingdom	Books	4	21	21	N	N	The Invisibles, Book 7: The Invisible Kingdom	Here it is, the final book of creator/writer Grant Morrison's Invisibles series.  Books 1-3 collected Volume 1, Books 4-6 collected Volume 2, and Book 7 collects Volume 3 in its entirety.  The previous two volumes had been over twenty issues each, but Volume 3 was only 12 issues, something which seems to spark much debate, these days.<br /><br />I have seen many claims that Volume 3 was only 12 issues due to low sales, that DC/Vertigo requested Morrison to wrap up his series in half the time, to cut costs.  This is simply not true.  Volume 3 is Morrison's full vision; nothing was cut out due to editorial constraints.  Here are Morrison's exact words, shortly before beginning Volume 3: \\"Volume 3 will appear as three four-part arcs-`Satanstorm'; `Karmageddon' and `The Invisible Kingdom'- in 1999. And then it's all done and I can go off and have my mid-life crisis in Tibet.  There are some fears that this may not work and that `sales' will be dealt a permanent blow, but I prefer to have faith in all you wunnerful people out there who've stayed on the bus so far, and I'd like to think you'd rather see The Invisibles completed as intended than have me hack it out to meet a monthly deadline.\\"<br /><br />As it's the final book in the series, you might expect The Invisible Kingdom to answer questions and end the long journey.  Unfortunately, you would be mistaken.  In fact, most of Volume 3 doesn't even feel like the Invisibles we know and love.  Where Volume 1 was slow-paced and focused on characterization, and Volume 2 was focused on action and metaphysics, Volume 3 seems like a totally different series.  The main cause for this is that the Invisibles themselves are relegated to supporting-character status; Mr. Six and his Division X pals and archvillain Sir Miles Delacourt instead get the most \\"screen time,\\" with King Mob, Jack, and Fanny reduced to small parts.<br /><br />To make things worse, when Morrison DOES feature the Invisibles, instead of using the characters we already know, he instead tortures us with a new Invisible named Helga, who is probably the most annoying character in the series.  Morrison obviously doesn't think so, however, as he gives Helga just about every \\"cool\\" line and \\"outrageous\\" action he can think of, in an attempt to make her cutting edge.  Instead, she comes off as an annoyingly pretentious bore, and it doesn't help that Morrison fails to give her any sort of background or emotional makeup.  What makes this all the more frustrating is that he uses this character so much, and totally ignores more interesting female Invisibles Ragged Robin and Boy.  It's like Morrison ran out of ideas for the main characters, and had to come up with someone new to carry the plot; the problem is, he couldn't have chosen a worse lead character.<br /><br />That being said, Book 7 picks up with Mr. Six and Division X, last seen in Book 3: \\"Entropy in the UK.\\"  They're still hot on the trail of Miles Delacourt and the monstrous \\"future king\\" of England.  Meanwhile, Mr. Six strives to help his teammates remember that they're actually undercover Invisibles agents.  In addition to this, Six and Helga attempt to deprogram Sir Miles.  While this is going on, Jack Frost is in Africa with Jolly Roger, where he comes closer to realizing his Buddhahood.  King Mob is mostly out of the picture, off meditating in India, trying to rid himself of the need to kill.<br /><br />After laying to rest 99 year-old Invisible Edith, King Mob et al reunite for the final showdown with Miles Delacourt and the demonic Archons he serves.  This culminates in a satanic crowning of the monstrous king on August 11, 1999, in a horrific ceremony which entails the butchering of children and homeless victims.  Instead of an action scene as in Volume 2, the events play out more along the lines of the mystical denouement of Volume 1, with Jack Frost once again proving he is the most powerful human alive.<br /><br />The above two paragraphs make the events of Volume 3 sound rather simplistic.  This is not the case.  As I mentioned, since this is the final volume of the series, one might expect Morrison to answer questions.  Instead, he chooses to make Volume 3 as opaque and difficult as possible.  Even the dialog doesn't help to sort things out; the characters don't talk to each other, they trade \\"I'm too cool\\" banter.  What makes this all the more grating is that Morrison so obviously has taken his themes and plots from the works of Robert Anton Wilson and Terrence McKenna; but unlike those authors, who always guide the reader through their labyrinthine visions, Morrison instead tosses everything into a blender and hopes it all comes out \\"cool.\\"  Therefore, the chance for any emotional impact is pretty much lost.<br /><br />Volume 3 is saved by the final story of the series, \\"Glitterdammerung.\\"  Fully illustrated by Frank Quitely, this is possibly the single best issue of the Invisibles.  The previous 11 issues of Volume 3 wrapped up the series storyline, but it was up to \\"Glitterdammerung\\" to explain what the series itself was all about.  Set in 2012 , the story operates more as a metaphysical look back at the series than as a linear tale.  It does tie up several subplots, and also ends the series on a defiantly anarchic note, as Jack Frost frees himself from the confines of the comic itself.  This story alone gives Book 7 a 4-star rating.<br /><br />The secret revealed in Book 7 is this (avoid this paragraph if you hate spoilers, though if you know this, it probably wouldn't \\"spoil\\" anything, anyway!): the Invisibles is a game, one that is being played by someone (John A'Dreams?  Jack Frost?  YOU?).  Toward the very end of the series, several characters begin to figure this out, most notably John A'Dreams, a white-suited former Invisible who disappeared before the events in Book 1: \\"Say You Want a Revolution.\\"  The idea is that the Invisibles is a reality-model experienced by those who wish to gain gnosis; hence the many, many times the phrase \\"Remember.  It's just a game\\" was stated throughout Books 1-6.  This entails the characters realizing they are not only works of fiction, but that each of them might even be the same person, only playing different characters, or \\"suits,\\" as one enlightened character calls them.  I've always felt this is Morrison's skewed way of interpreting the gnostic \\"all are one\\" belief, that all humans share one collective, unconscious soul - aka \\"God.\\"<br /><br />The art in Volume 3 is a mess.  Volume 1 of the Invisibles was plagued with a succession of artists, some good, some terrible.  Volume 2 corrected this in a big way.  Unfortunately Volume 3 goes back to Volume 1 territory, only it's worse.  Instead of different artists handling different story arcs, multiple artists work on the SAME story.  This was a terrible idea on Morrison's part, and I think it backfired on him, as the art was so underwhelming in some places that DC/Vertigo had to have certain pages re-illustrated for this collection.  Book 7 starts off promising enough, with Philip Bond and Warren Pleece's cartoonish art, but then it quickly falls to pieces when the \\"multiple artist\\" scenario rears its head.  Quitely saves the day at the end however, and his art on \\"Glitterdammerung\\" is just as phenomenal as his work on Morrison's \\"Flex Mentallo.\\"  Special mention must also be made of Brian Bolland's cover art for this trade paperback.  He's \\"remixed\\" the 12 original covers he did for Volume 3; one in particular, a \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" send-up, would make for a perfect poster.<br /><br />Even though this review has been mostly negative, Book 7 is still required reading for all those who have made it this far.  Morrison finishes the series in the fashion he intended from the start, and the character arcs are unique and inspiring.  For example, what other work of fiction would feature a character like King Mob, who realizes over the course of the series that he's degenerating into a killer?  Bruce Willis can kill umpteen terrorists in the \\"Die Hard\\" films and not once question if he himself is becoming as murderous as his enemies; King Mob instead gains enlightenment, and realizes that all life is precious.  Of course, if something like this happened in a mainstream action film, audiences would write it off as tree-hugging schlock.  But here it works, mostly because Morrison aimed for something higher with the Invisibles.  And most of the time, he succeeded.nosis; hence the many, many times the phrase \\"Remember.

US	52938460	R2I4JFJEJU283P	1563896001	797657928	The Invisibles Vol. 6: Kissing Mister Quimper	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Invisibles, Book 6: Kissing Mister Quimper	\\"Kissing Mister Quimper\\" is my favorite book in the Invisibles series, and in many ways I'd say it's the perfect introduction to creator/writer Grant Morrison's vision: it's chock-full of mysticism, fringe science, bizarre events, and Grade-A ultraviolence.  Unfortunately, since it collects the final issues of Volume 2, most of it would be nonsensical to someone who hasn't read the preceding five trade paperback collections.  So for that reason alone I can't recommend this book as a great starting place for those interested in jumping on the Invisibles train.<br /><br />Events pick up directly after those in Book 5: our favorite Invisibles cell, having \\"rescued\\" Boy from the deprogramming methods of another Invisibles cell, is currently regrouping in New Orleans.  While Lord Fanny, Jack, and Boy dance at a club and hook up with strangers and one another, King Mob and Ragged Robin head to Philadelphia.  There King Mob wants to finally figure out what happened to John A'Dreams, a former member of the cell who disappeared in 1992.  Mob last saw John in a Philadelphia church, where Archons had seemingly activated the Hand of Glory and corrupted the local timestream.  Now King Mob is convinced John \\"went over\\" to the other side; soon after entering the dank bowels of the church, he's also convinced John is coming after them.  What starts off as a horror/action scenario quickly takes a more paranoiac bent, as we learn that King Mob and Robin are really at the mercy of a \\"virtual assassin,\\" an enemy device that preys on its target's nervous system.<br /><br />\\"Black Science II\\" is the second arc, and it's one of my favorites.  A sequel to Volume 2's opening storyline (collected in Book 4: \\"Bloody Hell in America\\"), it features King Mob's cell reunited with fan-favorites Jolly Roger and Jim Crow, as they once again take on the US Army.  The first \\"Black Science\\" arc was a big-budget action film with an NC-17 rating; all technicolor blood, guts, and mayhem.  The sequel starts off similarly, but veers into metaphysics; not only paralleling Morrison's storytelling in Volume 1, but also foreshadowing that of Volume 3.  This arc also throws a huge spanner in the works: we've long known Ragged Robin's from the future, but here we also learn she's also apparently writing the story the Invisibles find themselves in.  This metatextual conceit, though initially befuddling, is something Morrison plays out in Volume 3.  But \\"Black Science II\\" isn't all metaphysics, as it features a healthy dose of action, violence, and reversals (i.e. Lord Fanny's surprise entrance in the military base).<br /><br />The book concludes with two stories that wrap up Volume 2, leading the way into the more surreal Volume 3.  The first story, \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" is one of the best in the series.  A time-fractured tale in which Ragged Robin returns to the future, it's similar in many ways to Volume 1's incredible \\"Best Man Fall\\" (which is collected in Book 2: \\"Apocalipstick\\").  \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" takes the series into areas it's never gone before, as even King Mob begins to wonder how much of what he's experienced is reality, and how much is the product of Robin's imagination.  The story ends with a haunting scene right out of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\"  The final issue, \\"The Tower,\\" concludes with the present-day Invisibles regrouping after losing two members: Robin's returned to 2012, and Boy decides to retire from the fray.<br /><br />Previously I stated that Phil Jimenez was the closest this series ever got to a permanent artist, but Chris Weston could just as easily make that claim.  He provides all the art for this book, and also penciled several fill-in issues in earlier books.  Weston's art is similar to Jimenez's (or vice versa), only Weston's is a bit more skewed, a bit more surreal.  This nicely complements Morrison's writing; whereas part of Jimenez's appeal was that he so realistically depicted Morrison's outrageous events, Weston gives us realism mixed with a dash of the bizarre.  His artwork here is superb, especially in the \\"Black Science II\\" arc; it's no wonder Morrison later tapped him to provide artwork for his \\"The Filth\\" maxi-series.<br /><br />Volume 2 of the series was (and still is) hotly debated by fans; some thought it was genius, others complained it was \\"watered down.\\"  I've always felt it was the best of the Invisibles.  Not only did it have the most consistent artwork, but it was also the most thematically pleasing (one example: Volume 2 opens and ends with King Mob standing in millionaire Invisible Mason Lang's lawn, holding a gun).  Ironically, Volume 3 is just as debated, though for different reasons - you won't find many people who claim Volume 3 was \\"watered down!\\"  However, I heartily encourage anyone who has made it this far into Morrison's twisted vision to pick up Book 7: \\"The Invisible Kingdom,\\" and hang onto this wild ride until the very end.s realism mixed with a dash of the bizarre.

He also wanted to satirize all of the elements of big-budget action films, the desired effect being that his readers would eventually see the inherent problems with them: if \\"heroes\\" can cause so much death and suffering, then how can they be good?  Unfortunately, this went over the heads of most readers, some of whom still claim that Volume 2 was a misstep, the Invisibles \\"Americanized\\" so the comic would achieve better sales.  They're wrong.  Volume 2 was the best of the Invisibles, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Book 5 is composed of three story arcs.  The first, \\"Time Machine Go,\\" finally answers many questions about Ragged Robin.  We see into her \\"past,\\" as we witness her life as an Invisible in 2012.  Robin's future cell is composed of Takashi, a Japanese scientist who features in the 1997 portion of the story (aka the \\"main\\" storyline of the series), a few unknown Invisibles, a heavyset Lord Fanny (who asks Robin to tell him/her to diet in the past), and an older Jack Frost, who doesn't curse nearly as much.  The 1997 narrative concerns a duo of Japanese Aum hoods torturing Takashi for information regarding his time machine.  King Mob comes to the rescue in one of the goriest rescue scenes ever, a scene which features my favorite one-liner of all time: King Mob's \\"YOU look like someone with an interesting story to tell.\\"  This story arc also provides more answers to old questions: namely, what the \\"Invisible College\\" is, and also what exactly the Invisibles and the Archons are fighting for.<br /><br />The next story arc is \\"Sensitive Criminals,\\" which is one of my favorite arcs of the entire series.  Here King Mob travels back to 1920s London, and meets up with an early 20Th Century Invisibles cell.  This arc is very similar to Volume 1 in feel and plot.  King Mob, who visits the past via a trance, appears to the `20s Invisibles as a ghost with substance, and he helps them activate the Hand of Glory.  The `20s Invisibles cell is interesting, with a young Edie (who previously appeared in the series as a 90 year-old woman), her cousin Freddie (whom we know better as the old and wizened Tom O'Bedlam in Book 1: \\"Say You Want a Revolution\\"), and their very own King Mob, this one a goateed soldier who cares little for occult stuff, and would rather just shoot at figures of authority.  Special mention must be made of Brian Bolland's cover art for the final issue of the \\"Sensitive Criminals\\" arc; it's a shot of Edie lying in bed, mostly naked, taking a hit from an opium pipe.  Without a doubt, it's one of the most erotic illustrations I've ever seen.<br /><br />\\"American Death Camp\\" is the last arc collected in the book. Unlike the previous two arcs, \\"Camp\\" mostly takes place during the main narrative, with the occasional flashback to Boy's past.  Picking up where Boy's background story (contained in Book 3: \\"Entropy in the UK\\") left off, here we finally find out who exactly Boy is, what she's doing with the Invisibles, and what her motives are.  King Mob and the other Invisibles search for her, with Jack's godlike psychic abilities aiding them along the way.  There's a great scene toward the end where they break into the building Boy's being held in, and are assaulted by \\"viral words,\\" some which distort their sense of reality, others which make them launch into \\"autocritique.\\"  Speaking of which, Robin's line during this autocritique session is one of the funniest in the series.  \\"Camp\\" is filled with intriguing ideas and concepts, but one thing that bugs me about this arcis that it's all a big fake-out, with cover-story upon cover-story, until the whole narrative becomes flustered; signs of what Morrison would ultimately do with the series itself.<br /><br />Phil Jimenez handles the art chores, and as usual, his work is detailed, crisp, and gorgeous.  Towards the end of the book his art loses a bit of its luster; no doubt due to his receiving scripts from Morrison late, and rushing to finish the artwork on time.  Chris Weston fills in for one issue, appearing for some reason under the pseudonym \\"Space Boy.\\"  Weston and Jimenez's artwork is comparable, so this doesn't imply a drop-off in art quality, something that plagued the previous trade paperbacks.<br /><br />\\"Counting to None\\" also includes an Invisibles short story that was published outside of the series: \\"And We're All Policemen,\\" which originally appeared in \\"Vertigo: Winter's Edge\\" (cover date: Winter 1998).  Simply put, \\"Policemen\\" is a split-second fantasy King Mob experiences moments after the last page of the final issue of the Invisibles (which can be found in Book 7: \\"The Invisible Kingdom\\").  This is according to Morrison himself.  \\"Policemen\\" features cartoonish art from Philip Bond, who later provided pencils in Volume 3.<br /><br />Incidentally, there was another non-series Invisibles story.  \\"Hexy,\\" published in the one-shot comic \\"Absolute Vertigo\\" (cover date: Fall 1995), was a 6-page story with inky but detailed art by Duncan Fegredro, and dealt with King Mob trying to overcome a spell.  Enjoyable but inconsequential, \\"Hexy\\" was never collected in the Invisibles trade paperbacks.  I assume this was either because Morrison and DC/Vertigo forgot about it, or because no one could figure out where in the Invisibles' continuity it took place.

Why?  It's a sad, pathetic story.  Flex, a character wholly created by Morrison, made his first appearance in Morrison's joyously avant garde \\"Doom Patrol\\" series (I believe it was in issue #35; I'm too lazy to dig out the issue to confirm).  When he first appeared, Flex looked more like Alan Moore than a hulking he-man: bearded, grimy, wrapped up in a dirty trench coat.  Eventually he realized who he was: \\"The Man of Muscle Mystery,\\" and regained his normal appearance - basically, he was the spitting image of Charles Atlas, complete with leopard-skin trunks.<br /><br />Flex's origin is also a hilarious parody of those old Charles Atlas funnybook advertisements.  You know: skinny dweeb gets picked on by beach bully, sends away for a muscle-building manual.  Only the manual Flex received taught him all sorts of esoteric uses for his muscles; now, each muscle was capable of a different power.  For example,  flexing his bicep might result in an earthquake, flexing his lats might allow him to see the future.  And just to really hammer home the Atlas parody, every time Flex strikes his \\"hero pose,\\" the words \\"Hero of the Beach\\" float above him: the exact same slogan that hovered above the character in the Charles Atlas ads.<br /><br />The issues of \\"Doom Patrol\\" with Flex didn't cause any trouble, and this series, published about 5 years later, didn't either.  So what happened?  Apparently, an overzealous fan brought the \\"Flex Mentallo\\" series to the attention of Charles Atlas Company representatives, more out of a \\"hey, you guys might think this is funny\\" attitude than anything else.  Unfortunately, Atlas saw no humor in it, and threatened DC/Vertigo (the publishers of \\"Doom Patrol\\" and \\"Flex Mentallo\\") with a lawsuit.  Long story short: DC won the case, but the verdict was that a percentage of the profits of anything published in the future featuring Flex would go to the Charles Atlas company.  It is only now, years later, that DC is getting around to publishing the remaining issues of Morrison's \\"Doom Patrol\\" in trade paperback form, and DC reps claim that it is only sales of these that will promise a \\"Flex Mentallo\\" collection.  In other words, DC has spent so much money on this lawsuit, they now will only publish \\"Flex\\" if the \\"Doom Patrol\\" trades sell exceptionally well.<br /><br />But what about the comic itself?  \\"Flex Mentallo\\" could easily be seen as Grant Morrison's masterwork, though I still prefer \\"The Invisibles.\\"  \\"Flex\\" is not only a celebration of superheroic myth, but also of comics themselves.  Each issue represents a different \\"era\\" of comics, and the narrative is post-modern and fractured to a point.  It's also one of the more literary comics out there, and will no doubt turn away those looking for mindless action and violence.  \\"Flex\\" would appeal to only a select few readers; its fame these days is no doubt due to its rarity, but also to the rising fame of Morrison and Quitely (who later worked together on \\"New X-Men.\\")<br /><br />Issue #1 gives tribute to the \\"Golden Age,\\" those comics from the `30s and `40s with simple good-versus-evil plots, where the hero usually won by knocking the villain out cold.  We see that \\"Flex\\" seemingly takes place in a different reality than the \\"Doom Patrol\\" comics; no mention is made of the Patrol or any other DC heroes.  Flex is about to enjoy an egg sandwich in the local diner when a shadowy figure hurls a bomb at a group of people.  Flex uses his muscles to scan the bomb, and it turns out to be a fake.  The police call Flex in for help in the investigation; turns out these fake bombs are showing up everywhere.  Flex suspects that his old partner-in-crimefighting, The Fact, is somehow involved, and resolves to get to the bottom of it.  Meanwhile, in another narrative, a  young rock star named Wallace Sage,the man who created Flex as a child, has just taken loads of drugs in a bid for suicide, and calls up the Samaritans.  All he wants to do is talk about comic books before he dies.<br /><br />Issue #2 is the \\"Silver Age,\\" the weird and psychedelic comics of the `50s and `60s.  Flex continues his quest to find The Fact.  Along the way he reminisces about his past adventures, all of them Silver Age-type goofiness.  (The issue also features one of the very best splash pages I've ever seen: a shot of Flex squaring off against his Silver Age nemesis \\"The Mentallium Man.\\")  First Flex comes across a group of delinquents who are shooting up with a lethal drug that unleashes the hero within.  Then he discovers there is a group of superheroes who might be able to help him; apparently they're the last such group of costumed fighters left in the world.  They're called \\"The Legion of Legions,\\" and Flex sets off to find them.  Meanwhile, Wallace Sage continues his drug-hazed diatribe with the Samaritans, espousing on his love of comics.  He also tries unsuccessfully to free a buried memory, something that happened to him as a child.<br /><br />Issue #3 is the \\"Dark Age,\\" those `70s and `80s comics that swayed into nihilism, with heroes just as dangerous as the villains: comics like Frank Miller's \\"Dark Knight Returns.\\"  Journeying into the underground of the nameless city this takes place in, Flex begins to question the bizarre adventures he had back in the Silver Age; very nice commentary by Morrison on the incongruity of continuity-heavy comics.  Things get even more unreal as Flex discovers an underground club for \\"adult superheroes.\\"  Here Frank Quitely unleashes every costume he can think of, as we witness at least a hundred different heroes in various, exquisitely-detailed costumes engaging in all manner of \\"adult\\" situations.  It's a costumed orgy, and Flex warily makes his way through it, trying to find the transporter tube that will take him to the Legion of Legions headquarters.  Wallace Sage continues his soul-plumbing, and finally remembers his suppressed memory - as a child, he actually met a group of superheroes.  And in a third narrative, the crusty police chief from issue #1 hooks up with supervillain \\"The Hoaxer,\\" and the two of them set off to find Flex and help him \\"save the world.\\"<br /><br />Issue #4 is the \\"New Age,\\" or what I gather Morrison hopes comics will one day be: positive myths in which readers discover that they themselves are superheroes.  But first we witness how actual superheroes invaded our reality, centuries ago, as their reality was destroyed in a \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\"-type tragedy.  Crashing into our reality, they embedded themselves in our imaginations; this is why comic books were invented, Wallace Sage realizes.  The heroes in our subconscious are using them to show us WHO we can really be; we're all heroes, ourselves.  The crusty chief and The Hoaxer pass through the \\"adult club\\" from issue #3, finding everyone there dead.  The two of them use the transporter tube to go to the Legion of Legion headquarters, and there they team up with Flex to defeat the \\"villain\\" behind everything, a man-on-the-moon faced opponent who turns out to be none other than Wallace Sage.  Or Wally, that is - here he is a cynical teenager who confuses \\"realism with pessimism,\\" as Flex puts it.  Flex gets the best line in the series here, when he tells Wally: \\"Being clever's a fine thing, but sometimes a boy just needs to get out of the house and meet some girls.\\"  The series ends with Wallace Sage rejoicing in the hero within, and the formerly-repressed superheroes of our imaginations being set free into our world.<br /><br />But that's just a recap of the narrative elements of \\"Flex Mentallo.\\"  There's a lot going on in this series.  In many ways it's even an autobiography, as a lot of Wallace Sage's memories are no doubt Grant Morrison's own.  Even the illustrations are post-modern, referencing other comics in bothstyle and manner.  There are also little in-jokes; in issue #2, Flex goes to a coffee shop, and you can easily spot Clark Kent and Ozymandius (from \\"Watchmen\\") dining inside.  Morrison is on-form throughout, and it's easy to see why he considers this to be one of the best things he's written.  (Incidentally, the fact that \\"Flex\\" has been blocked from publication as a trade collection sends Morrison into fits of rage.)<br /><br />Frank Quitely's artwork is a joy to behold.  Quitely's style is a mixture of cartoonish and finely-detailed.  It doesn't look like anyone else I can think of, and his art here is without question the best I've ever seen in a comic.  His work on \\"Flex Mentallo\\" is probably his best ever, and even Morrison stated  it was \\"the most beautiful artwork to ever grace one of my scripts.\\"  Quitely himself once claimed \\"Flex Mentallo\\" was \\"more important than the Bible for comic fans,\\" returning the compliment.<br /><br />So, let's hope one day soon you'll be able to press \\"add to shopping cart\\" immediately after reading this review.  DC has made several positive comments recently about \\"Flex\\" being published in trade form, so don't spend an arm and a leg on those back issues.  Have faith, because it seems fairly certain that this book will appear someday.  The sooner the better - when I'm in the mood for a re-reading, I'm usually too lazy to get the issues out of storage.

Unfortunately, heavily-armed \\"Myrmidons\\" have surrounded them, and what follows is the first all-out action scene since the very beginning of Book 1.<br /><br />After this, things slow down a little, as creator/writer Grant Morrison \\"opens up\\" the world of the Invisibles.  Even though we still don't know much about our main characters (King Mob, Boy, Ragged Robin, Lord Fanny), Morrison introduces new people to the fold, and we see how the exploits of the Invisibles affect the rest of the world.<br /><br />First we are introduced to one of the more monstrous creatures ever witnessed in mass media entertainment, something that just might be the next king of England.  Then we meet Jim Crow, an Invisible witch doctor who's both a world-famous rapper and a host for sacrifice-hungry voodoo spirits.  And finally we are given one of the best single-issue stories in the series, \\"Best Man Fall,\\" which, despite its seeming insignificance to the larger story, possesses more heart and emotion than any other in the series' history.  A nonlinear narrative, this story shows how the \\"other side\\" works, and for once we see how our \\"heroes\\" (King Mob in particular) could just as easily be seen as \\"the bad guys.\\"  This is a great story, and worth the price of Book 2 alone.<br /><br />The book closes out with a story arc that revolves around transvestite shaman Lord Fanny, in which we see his/her initiation as a young boy into the world of the supernatural.  At the same time, the forces of darkness close in on the Invisibles in the present, and the two storylines merge into a narrative that defies the laws of the time/space continuum.<br /><br />This arc is the first glimmerings of Morrison's grander scheme with the series; whereas before the Invisibles worked on an us-versus-them mentality, now we slowly begin to see that there are larger ideas at play.  The volume ends with a story showing where Jack went, after his escape in the book's opening story, and finalizes his character arc from defiant loner to full-fledged Invisible.<br /><br />The artwork is again split among various artists, with my favorite being Chris Weston in the Jim Crow story (Weston later became the regular artist, after Phil Jimenez's run on the title).  Jill Thompson turns in the first story, capping off her run that began in Book 1, and she returns with the Lord Fanny arc, with a few one-off artists filling in on the other stories.  Again, the artwork is nowhere near the level of Morrison's writing, but it's not terrible.  In fact, the art takes second place to the writing in the Invisibles, because this isn't \\"just\\" a comic book: the Invisibles is subversive literature of the highest order.ersus-them mentality, now we slowly begin to see that there are larger ideas at play.

US	52938460	R30A2E7MNPVDXA	1563897288	775785839	The Invisibles Vol. 3: Entropy in the UK	Books	4	6	6	N	N	The Invisibles, Book 3: Entropy in the UK	After the sometimes-underwhelming art of the previous two collections, Phil Jimenez's artwork in the first half of Book 3 of the Invisibles is sort of like a slap to the face: vibrant, detailed, masterful.  Luckily, he later became the regular artist on the series, but here he only illustrates the opening arc, a three-part saga that details King Mob's torture at the hands of Archon agents, and which also provides this volume with its title.<br /><br />In a way, this is the true beginning of what the Invisibles would soon become known for: fast-paced ideas and action, and an onslaught of mysticism, fringe science, and conspiracy theories.  I've never been sure if it was Jimenez's amazing artwork that lead to this, or if Morrison finally thought his readers were \\"ready\\" for the big time, but regardless, from here on out things happen, and events unfold at a maddening pace all the way until the final volume of the series.<br /><br />Having been captured at the end of Book 2, Invisibles King Mob and Lord Fanny are at the mercy of Sir Miles Delacourt, straightlaced and overbearing agent of the demonic Archons.  Here, finally, we get to know a bit more about King Mob, as Delacourt invades his mind and sorts through his past.  This is full-on psychedelia, as King Mob attempts to defend himself in the guise of fictional character Gideon Stargrave, a mod super-spy from the `60s (and author Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius in all but name; something Morrison readily admitted).  This results in Delacourt waging a mental war against King Mob's psychic defenses, with the Stargrave segments providing some outrageous cross-dimensional action sequences.  Very heady stuff, with lots of mystic ideas dropped, this arc is easily one of the high points of the entire series.<br /><br />After this storyline, the narrative slows down for a moment as we have a single-issue peek into Boy's background.  Boy, the black female martial artist Invisible, was never Morrison's strongest creation.  In fact, he eventually admitted this, and basically dropped the character toward the end of the series.  Therefore, her spotlight issue, \\"How I Became An Invisible,\\" is probably my least favorite story in the Invisibles canon.  It hints at interesting developments that later become integral to the series (shadowy government agents taking innocent black Americans prisoner, and shipping them off in mysterious trains), but Morrison ruins it all by having the characters speak in some of the most fake \\"black\\" dialog ever.  You can tell he's out of his element, a Scottish writer creating \\"urban\\" dialog for inner-city black Americans.  It doesn't really work.<br /><br />Things get back on track after this, with the narrative picking right up after the events in the opening arc.  Though King Mob and Fanny have defeated Sir Miles, they're still trapped in a building that's crawling with enemy soldiers and ultraterrestrial beings.  The remaining Invisibles cell (Dane, Boy, Ragged Robin) call in reinforcements, and fellow Invisibles Jim Crow and Mr. Six show up to help.  This results in a multi-issue storyline that features all sorts of high-concept action, as the Invisibles wade through hell-on-Earth protective spells and defend themselves against cancer-inducing nanoweapons.<br /><br />The book ends with a single-issue look at Division X, the swaggering British counterpart of the X-Files (Mr. Six is one of the three members of Division X, incidentally).  This story seemingly has nothing much to do with anything else in the series so far, until much later, when the themes brought up here are developed.  The story does feature the first appearance of the impish, demonic Quimper, a frightening little creature who will cause the Invisibles much trouble in future volumes.<br /><br />As mentioned, Phil Jimenez provides the art for the first half of the book, with Steve Yeowell filling in the other half.  This is pleasing thematically, as Yeowell started off the series, and his finishing up the first major arc makes sense.  However, I've never been the greatest fan of his work.  The Boy/Division X issues are penciled by fill-in artists: one scratchy, the other Todd McFarlane-esque.<br /><br />This trade paperback wraps up what was the first volume of the Invisibles comic run.  After these issues, DC/Vertigo halted publication for a few months, and Morrison revised his approach to the story.  After this, no longer would the story come off as methodically-paced as it had in earlier issues (the Marquis de Sade storyline in the \\"Say You Want a Revolution\\" trade in particular); instead, the series would feature nonstop action, sex, and ultraviolence.  Some say this new approach was a \\"watered down\\" version of the Invisibles, but I say that's hogwash.  The stories collected in this book are great, true, but the best was yet to come for the Invisibles.However, I've never been the greatest fan of his work.

When it started in 1994 I was a sophomore in college, and when it ended a few months into 2000 I was holed up in a soul-sapping corporate job.  Regardless, during those 6 years I was able to get my hands on each issue, despite the fact that I'd \\"quit\\" reading comics in high school.  But there was something special about the Invisibles, and it kept me coming back for more; I even set up a service with the local comic store so they'd hold each month's issue for me, and I'd come in every few weeks, grab them, and high-tail it out of there.<br /><br />The Invisibles, as a whole, is as important to the `90s as \\"Naked Lunch\\" was to the `50s, as \\"Illuminatus!\\" was to the `70s.  I suspected this when reading the comic monthly, but now, years later, I know it for a fact.  Unfortunately, it's doubtful more people will come to this realization, as the Invisibles is simply too big to fit into one handy volume, a la those aforementioned subversive classics.  To digest the entire story, you need to track down seven trade paperbacks.  No doubt this will stunt the virus-like growth the Invisibles would otherwise engender on the innocent minds of those who read it.  This series can change lives; this has been proven and accounted for.<br /><br />\\"Say You Want a Revolution\\" is the first book of the Invisibles, and this early out, things are presented in more of a black and white/us versus them scenario; it is only in later volumes that writer/creator Grant Morrison begins to subvert and reveal the \\"larger picture.\\"  Here we are taken by the hand and led into the underground and bizarre world of the Invisibles by tagging along with Dane McGowan, an unruly, teenaged Liverpudlian street punk who just might be humanity's last hope in the battle against the Archons, demonic enforcers of Order.  The opening half of this book details Dane's initiation, and here we meet the cast of characters who will carry the series till the end.<br /><br />First and foremost, there's King Mob, a multi-pierced assassin excelling in physical and psychic combat.  Next there's Ragged Robin, a sometimes-crazy redhead with psychic powers who claims to be from the future.  There's Boy, the ironically-named black woman who's an ex-cop with all sorts of skeletons in her closet, and a black belt in every form of martial art to boot.  And finally there's Lord Fanny, transvestite shaman supreme.  Dane himself is a ragamuffin of a lead character; you'll probably dislike him for the first few issues, until the human is revealed beneath all of the cursing.<br /><br />\\"Say You Want a Revolution\\" begins with a quick pace, Dane being locked up in a sinister boarding school by agents of the Archons, and King Mob coming to his rescue with guns blazing.  After that things slow down for a while, as Dane is tutored by the magically-powered Tom O'Bedlam.  This section is good reading, as gradually Dane becomes a more likeable character, but the rest of the Invisibles disappear for a while, and some of the dialog (particularly from Tom) comes off as Morrison pontificating to his audience.  It gets to be a bit too much after awhile.<br /><br />At any rate, Dane is soon initiated (which entails a jumping-from-a-skyscraper test that was completely stolen by the producers of the Matrix), and his adventures with the Invisibles proper begin.  However, those expecting the slam-bang escapades hinted at in the early issues will have to wait; instead of more fireworks, the team (or \\"cell\\" as they call themselves) mentally project themselves into the past, to bring one of their own back to the 1990s.  This Invisible of the past is none other than the Marquis De Sade, and this section of the book, complete with sideline discussions between Elizabethan poets Byron and Shelley, is undoubtedly the most \\"literary\\" comic ever written.  Unfortunately, this story arc was also nearly the death bell for the series, so early into itsrun: sales dropped to negligible levels.<br /><br />The Marquis De Sade storyline is wrapped up in time for the volume's end, however we're left with one heck of a cliffhanger.  And that's pretty much it.  If my review sounds a bit negative, don't be fooled.  It's just that these opening stories seem very static when compared to what comes later.  I realize this was not only intentional but necessary; had the series began with the whirlwind events presented in later volumes, a lot of people would have jumped ship in confusion, and the series might never have been completed.<br /><br />Morrison's writing is his trademark bevy of ideas, one-liners, and profundities.  Some of it can come off as a bit too self-serving (King Mob's conversation with Boy in the club, for example), but not so much as to annoy.  The Invisibles in a way works as Morrison's autobiography; no doubt it will be what he is remembered for, in decades to come.<br /><br />The art, however, is where the trouble comes in.  The Invisibles was plagued with a procession of artists throughout its run, some talented, some workmanlike.  The closest the series ever got to a \\"regular artist\\" was Phil Jimenez, and he only lasted for about fourteen issues.  Here the art chores are split between Steve Yeowell and Jill Cramer.  Yeowell's art is a bit too scratchy and ragged for my tastes, but it gets the job done.  Cramer's is a bit more \\"artsy\\" and elegiac.  Both artists are fine, but future volumes boast great material by Chris Weston, Phil Jimenez, and the unrivaled Frank Quitely.<br /><br />This first book of the Invisibles is your introduction to one of the greatest works of the 20th Century (and I truly mean that).  Once you read it, you're either in or you're out.

During this hiatus,  creator/writer Grant Morrison revised his approach to the series.  Deciding that the previous volume had been \\"British\\" and that the new one would be \\"American,\\" Morrison abandoned the methodical pace of Volume 1 and filled Volume 2 with nonstop action, sex, and ultraviolence.  Some say this new approach was a \\"watered down\\" version of the Invisibles, but I say that's hogwash.  The stories collected in this book are the cream of the crop, and fulfill all of the promise of the very first issues of the series.<br /><br />Book 4 collects the first four issues of Volume 2, and the change is immediately noticeable.  First and foremost is the return of artist supreme Phil Jimenez.  Last seen in Book 3's \\"Entropy in the UK\\" arc, Jimenez is probably my favorite artist who ever worked on the series.  His art is detailed, clean, precise, and beautifully rendered; everything you could ask for, really.  Morrison scored a huge coup when he brought Jimenez on board as the regular artist, something the series never had before.  Therefore, there are no drops in artwork quality in this collection, as there were in the previous three trade paperbacks.<br /><br />Picking up a year after the events at the end of Book 3, Book 4 opens with the Invisibles (King Mob, Dane, Ragged Robin, Lord Fanny, Boy) recouping in upstate New York, residing in the colossal mansion of millionaire Invisible Mason Lang.  Lang is an interesting character, a neurotic Bruce Wayne-type who obsesses over the \\"hidden meanings\\" of mainstream films.  The events depicted at the end of Book 3 nearly killed our favorite Invisibles cell, but now King Mob thinks the team is ready for more action.<br /><br />Sure enough, Jolly Roger shows up, looking for help.

Among them was \\"The Apocalypse Unsealed,\\" published in 1910, an esoteric dissection of Revelations.  In 1914 Pryse published an even more ambitious work, the mammoth Restored New Testament.  Once again Pryse attempted to unveil the Hellenic origins of Christianity, while at the same time revealing the esoteric aspect of the texts.<br />A noble effort, and all those who seek to understand or discover the rumored \\"hidden meanings\\" of Christianity should look no further.  Whereas most books on mystical Christianity only mention that the New Testament can be read allegorically, but never explain how exactly this can be done, Pryse does all the work for you; this book clearly defines the allegorical interpretations.  In doing this, Pryse utilizes research similar to that of modern historians; only Pryse veers off into a more mystical direction.<br />It is Pryse's theory that the Jesus myth was \\"stolen\\" by Hellenized Jews who came across a document that contained the secret teachings of a Pagan Mystery cult, one devoted to Dionysus, Mithra, or the like.  These \\"exoteric priests,\\" who were nothing more than \\"thieves\\" who wrote in \\"uncultured Greek,\\" took this secret document and changed it, replacing the \\"Sun God\\"  (i.e. Dionysus, Mithra, etc) with a Jew named Iesous, aka Jesus.  These forgers then grafted onto the Pagan Mystery document Judaic fragments, such as references to the Old Testament and a lineage that made Iesous appear to be a descendant of David, in order to make the story acceptable to their Jewish target audience.<br />There are several problems apparent with Pryse's thesis, of course.  One, there is no evidence of any stolen Mystery document.  (Or is there?  Could this be the long-rumored \\"Q\\" document??)  Secondly, Pryse blames the forgery on a nameless group of Jews who had gained access to the hidden secrets of a Mystery cult.  But on closer inspection, this is no different from the theory advanced by modern scholars, most of whom have proven how severely the gospels have been edited over the ages.  And three, Pryse veers into speculation by claiming to know, just from reading, what parts of the Testament gospels are genuine, and which have been mutated by the forgers.  Pryse offers no notes, and can give no testimonials to the accuracy of his claims.  All he has is his classical education and considerable knowledge of Pagan religions, astrology, and Indian metaphysics.<br />That being said, it is uncanny how accurate much of Pryse's scholarship turns out to be.  His theory, that Jesus was a nonexistent character based on dying and resurrecting Pagan godmen such as Dionysus, is much in line with the theories of such authors as Earl Doherty, Timothy Freke, and Peter Gandy, who wrote their own, similar books nearly a hundred years later.  But whereas these modern writers just offer speculation that the Jesus myth was \\"lifted\\" from the Pagan Mysteries, Pryse proves it; quite believably, I should add.<br />As a matter of fact, this book served as a lightning bolt to my senses.  I had just read Robert Eisenman's \\"James the Brother of Jesus,\\" a weighty tome on the existence of an historical Jesus.  Eisenman makes clear in his opening that ALL of his research stands on one assumption: that some (certainly not all) of the gospel accounts, epistles, Dead Sea scrolls, and Acts of the Apostles document are based on historical truth.  Pryse, however, theorizes (and goes about proving) that all of the characters in these documents are fictional creations.  In fact, The Restored New Testament can be seen as the opposite image of Eisenman's book.  Both authors make the same assumptions: that names have been changed in the gospels to fit the whims of Literalist editors (i.e., Judas being replaced by \\"Peter,\\" etc), but whereas Eisenman takes the documents at face value, Prysetakes them with a large dose of salt.  And, if you go with Pryse's theory, it makes Eisenman's work seem like a big book about nothing at all.takes them with a large dose of salt.

The first is titled \\"The Anointing of Iesous,\\" which is a combination of the synoptic gospels into linear order, excluding all mention of Jewish religion, with commentary.  Next is the \\"Crowning of Jesus,\\" a metrical re-telling of the gospels, again only retaining the portions that Pryse sees as obviously Hellenic.  (Pryse states that he feels the Mystery document \\"stolen\\" by the Jewish priests was a poem; therefore, he feels that the gospels themselves should be poems.)  Pryse follows this with a summation and study of parts of the fourth gospel.<br />Next Pryse goes over the letters of Paul that he finds to be genuine (again, Pryse's estimation of which Paul letters were and weren't genuine are amazingly in keeping with today's scholarship), and once again covers the Apocalypse, though in this book he re-writes it in metrical form.  He ignores Acts, as he finds it to be complete fabrication.  The book concludes with literal translations of the Synoptic gospels, including the Jewish \\"additions,\\" with commentary explaining why Pryse finds the Jewish religion parts to be interpolations to the original, Hellenic text.<br />This part is great, as Pryse's detestation of fundamentalist Christianity is full of acidic wit.  This was my favorite part of the book, and I think the first-time reader should start off with this section, before diving into Pryse's re-writing of the Jesus story, the \\"Anointing of Iesous.\\"  I feel that it gives a better reasoning behind Pryse's theory; you understand more fully why he chose to edit out the Jewish parts of the gospels in his rewrite.  Also, it points out obvious mistakes and forgeries in the gospels (most of which I'd never even realized) that, if read by an intelligent person, should put the final nail in the coffin of one's fundamentalism.<br />Again, though Pryse takes many liberties with the texts and makes many assumptions, his findings will prove to be on the mark for fans of Freke/Gandy/Doherty, and all who ponder the existence of a historical Jesus.  I found Apocalypse Unsealed to be the more Earth-shaking book (Christendom owes Pryse many thanks for the writing of that book, as it gave freedom from the doom and gloom, mistaken idea that Revelations offers a future history of the world's end), but the Restored New Testament will provide insightful reading for those interested in the subjects it covers.  Though James Morgan Pryse seems to have been forgotten by the modern reading public, his books are still relevant, possibly more relevant than ever.  Let's hope a legitimate publisher brings this book back on the market; all we have now is this Kessingner edition, which is cheaply photocopied from an early printing, and, even worse, is split into two volumes.for fans of Freke/Gandy/Doherty, and all who ponder the existence of a historical Jesus.

Since these books feature the first battles in the Iliad, this book is action-packed from first page to last.  An online reviewer compared this book to the first twenty minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and that's a very apt comparison.  Like those twenty minutes of film, the fifty pages that make up All Day Permanent Red are a hectic, heart-pounding melee of bloodshed.<br />More importantly, this book marks the first appearance in action of my favorite character in the Iliad, Diomedes.  Though here he is called Diomed, or the Child, as Logue occasionally refers to him.  Diomedes is like a replacement Achilles; while that famous hero sulks in his ship, Diomedes takes up the mantle of \\"wartime hero\\" and destroys every Trojan in his path.  Logue's handling of the character is excellent, especially in the way he is introduced.  As Odysseus witnesses his Achaean fellows being slaughtered on the battlefield, he prays to the god Athena for help.  What follows is the best line in the book:<br />Setting down her topaz saucer heaped with nectarine jelly,<br />Emptying her blood-red mouth, set in her ice-white face,<br />Teenaged Athena jumped up and shrieked:<br />\\"Kill!  Kill for me!<br />Better to die than live without killing!\\"<br />Who says prayer does no good?<br />As you can see from this quote, Logue's is not a standard translation of the Iliad.  As any reader of his earlier collection \\"War Music\\" knows, Logue re-writes and changes the Iliad to suit his tastes.  In fact, the man can't even read Greek.  But his version of the book is adored by Homer-ophiles.  If you asked me, I'd rather read Logue's cinematic bursts of action-packed, freestyle verse over any of the more noted, straight-up translators, such as Fagles, Lattimore, and Fitzgerald.<br />This book is highly recommended to anyone who's read the Iliad, and wants to see a master writer at work.  The only problem is that it's so short, and I fear that Logue won't be able to finish the whole of the Iliad itself.  We can only hope.nts to see a master writer at work.

Writing in the early 20th Century, Pryse got to the very root of Christianity, proving via the Gospels themselves that Christianity began as a Jewish version of the pagan Greek Mysteries.  In his Apocalypse Unsealed (1910), Pryse showed how the so-called Book of Revelations is actually a gnostic text on spiritual salvation; in 1911 he published Reincarnation in the New Testament, which used several incidents from the Bible to prove its title; and in 1914 he published his most ambitious book on the subject of Christianity: the mammoth Restored New Testament, which is required reading for all would-be gnostics.  However, Pryse wrote the Magical Message in 1900, and here the acidic wit that was later directed toward Fundamentalist Christianity is nowhere to be found, or at the very least, is much more subdued.  In this book Pryse takes the reader by the hand and guides him or her through the mystical treatise known as the Gospel of John.<br />Scholars and churchmen alike have long known that John is the most mystical of the canonical scriptures.  In fact, when the Catholic Church put together the Canon, the inclusion of John was hotly debated; most of the Literalists felt that it was too Gnostic.  That most Christians have glossed over the obviously mystical and Gnostic message of this gospel is unfortunate.  The words John uses, such as \\"logos,\\" meekly translated into English as \\"word,\\" are Pagan terms that prefigure Christianity, and prove the Greek Mystery origins of history's most enduring world religion.<br />James Pryse proves in this book that the Gospel of John is an initiation allegory in which Jesus, aka Iesous, ascends from his role as an adept into a reborn Gnostic, fully aware of his divine nature and thus acquiring all the esoteric knowledge and power that entails.  And, just as Pryse proposes that Jesus himself is an allegorical figure, representing each adept on his or her quest to self-knowledge, he proposes that every other character in the gospel is but a manifestation of Jesus' other natures, such as Peter, who represents Jesus' lower self.<br />One thing I really liked about this book is that Pryse takes up for one of my favorite segments of this gospel, which scholars today are quick to categorize as spurious.  Even in Pryse's day this part was considered to be a later addition, but Pryse explains in a detailed footnote why the segment is not only central to the entire gospel, but is also completely original to it.  The part I mean is where the Jews bring an adulterous woman to Jesus, and want to stone her, which leads to Jesus' famous \\"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\" line.  Whereas scholars these days tend to ignore this part of the gospel, Pryse explains why it is important for all who want to understand the Jesus myth.<br />The book is arranged with a few opening chapters in which Pryse explains his methods of uncovering the Pagan Mysteries origin of the gospel, as well as explaining Pagan theories on life, death, and the afterlife.  Then on to the translation of the gospel itself, which is supplemented with copious, and detailed, footnotes.  James Pryse certainly knew his stuff, and reading the notes alone proves to be an enlightening experience.<br />Though it isn't as revelatory as his Apocalypse Unsealed, or titanic as his Restored New Testament, James Pryse's Magical Message of Ioannes is still required reading for the modern-day mystic.ept on his or her quest to self-knowledge, he proposes that every other character in the gospel is but a manifestation of Jesus' other natures, such as Peter, who represents Jesus' lower self.  <br />One thing I really liked about this book is that Pryse takes up for one of my favorite segments of this gospel, which scholars today are quick to categorize as spurious.

I've only recently become aware of Christopher Logue's retelling of Homer's Iliad.  Logue's been working on his translation for decades, though.  This volume collects all of his Iliad material from 1962 to 1995, which is a measly three books.  Chronologically, these books are \\"The Kings,\\" which is the first book in this collection.  Published in 1991, it covers the first two books of the Iliad.  Next up is \\"The Husbands,\\" from 1994, which covers books three and four.  Finally there is \\"War Music\\" itself, originally published in 1980, and comprised of books 16 through 19.  This includes \\"Patroclea,\\" written in 1962, \\"GBH\\" (a British legal term meaning \\"Grievous Bodily Harm\\"), apparently written in 1980, and \\"Pax,\\" written in 1967.<br />As you can see, Logue takes his time releasing books.  This collection came out in 1997, and since then he has published only one further volume, \\"All Day Permanent Red,\\" which came out in February 2003 and covers books 5 and 6; the first battle scenes in the Iliad.  Being that Logue was born in 1926, I'm really hoping he'll live to re-write the remaining books of the story.  But judging from his past rate of output, I'm afraid it's not very likely.<br />The problem with Logue's Homer is that there's no turning back.  After reading this, even in its unfinished state, all other translations of the Iliad pale in comparison.  I even read the Penguin book \\"Homer in English,\\" which features samples from the majority of English translations of Homer, and Logue's struck me as better than any of them.  The reason he excels over others is that Logue jettisons all parts of the Iliad that are not cinematic, that are not moving, and that are repetitious.  We're left with a fast-moving narrative in unrhyming, free-style verse that features some of the best writing and most memorable dialog I've ever come across.  This is a book that demands to be read and re-read, due to the quality of writing.  And I'm a guy who usually avoids poetry.<br />I wouldn't recommend this to the first-time reader of the Iliad, however.  Logue refers to some characters and gods in off-hand, casual ways that might confuse those new to Homer's world.  For example, Apollo is several times referred to as \\"the Mouse God\\" before he is actually referred to as Apollo.  Likewise, Logue flat-out makes up names for several characters, even re-naming some of the lesser characters.  This is more of a book to be enjoyed by someone who's already read a standard translation of the Iliad; that way the changes and deletions Logue has made to the story become more apparent, and more appreciated.ldn't recommend this to the first-time reader of the Iliad, however.

Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy have attempted to unveil gnosis for the modern reader, taking away the complexity of the scrolls that have come down through the ages to us; they make gnosis accessible to all who seek it. They also do what the ancients would consider unthinkable: Freke and Gandy reveal the goal, and secrets, of gnosis.<br />Freke and Gandy hinted at the secret teachings of the original Christians in their previous book, \\"The Jesus Mysteries.\\" Wisely, they chose only to give a glimmer of these secrets there, as a full-blown examination of gnosis would've been outside of that book's boundaries. However, Jesus and the Lost Goddess is devoted to nothing but, and the authors are to be congratulated on their skillful presentation of gnosis for the modern reader.<br />In particular, I am indebted to them for finally making me see the positive side of gnosticism. In fact, their clear-cut view made me kick myself for never having noticed it before. After reading several other books about the gnostics, I was turned off by what seemed to be their total hatred for life. For example, the followers of Mani didn't marry, lived the lives of celibates, and basically waited for death. A horrible life-view, and to me seemingly a waste of the gift of life.<br />Freke and Gandy turn this view around; of course the gnostics believed that the body and the world were at heart a tomb, but at the same time, just as they practiced and preached docetism (that everything is composed of conflicting natures), they believed that, just as life can be bad, it can also be good. A simple view, but so much better than that presented by Literalist Christians. When asked how a \\"just God\\" could allow all of the human suffering that has been witnessed in human history, the fundamentalist can only offer vapid excuses. The gnostic, however, can say that of course life is bad, this world is hell; but good can happen just as easily, and everything, both good and bad, is just a test on our character. More importantly, it's just a movie we're watching; like the Platonists, the gnostics deemed Consciousness immortal: though our frail bodies might suffer and die, our soul is merely a spectator of events. So smile, even though you suffer, for nothing can truly harm you. And the \\"All is One\\" concept has never been advanced as breezily and believably.<br />In short, this is the type of book I've been searching for. It can give one a new lease on life. It wisely doesn't preach a return to gnosticism; Freke and Gandy explain why this would be absurd in their final chapter, \\"The New Improved Testament.\\" This part of the book is especially affecting, as the authors point out several \\"bad ideas\\" that have corrupted our minds, and offer \\"good ideas\\" to combat them. Their response to the \\"bad idea\\" that God is a male is both hilarious and enlightening.<br />I would love to give a copy of this book to those people I know who are fundamentalist Christians. I think it could reveal to them how they've been mislead by two thousand years of \\"Christian\\" oppression and suppression. That it's time to grow up and leave the old cultural prejudices behind. But I don't think they could handle it. They'd probably end up stoning me to death.<br />The truth hurts.oth good and bad, is just a test on our character.

Found several faults with John Dominic Crossnan's left-wing theories?  Think John Marco Allegro was way off and Jesus was in fact NOT really a mushroom?  Then Bart Ehrman's first-class Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium is the book for you.<br />Ehrman writes with an amazing combination of historical acumen, detail, and whit.  That last is the most important.  After untold dry, boring tomes about the historical Jesus, it's refreshing to read something from a learned scholar who knows the importance of a well-timed joke or two.  The opening of the book is a perfect case of this, in which Ehrman gives a humorous run-down of the many people over the past 2,000 years who've declared that the world would end, but ended up just embarrassing themselves.<br />The meat of the book is comprised of a thorough (yet accessible) synopsis of the historical pursuit of Jesus.  Ehrman gives all the facts, from what documents exist to who presumably wrote them, which of course will be a lot of common knowledge to those familiar with these books, but will be fascinating for those who have never read a book about the historical Jesus.<br />Ehrman is a follower of Albert Schweitzer's theory: namely, that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet who believed Jehovah would return within his own lifetime.  However, Ehrman doesn't completely follow Schweitzer's nihilistic theory, that Jesus put himself on the cross under the mistaken belief that his death would hasten Jehovah's arrival.  Ehrman convincingly promotes this \\"apocalyptic preacher\\" theory.  Along the way he also takes time to look at the views of others, namely John Dominic Crossnan.  And though Ehrman is professionally polite when inspecting Crossnan's (and the Jesus Seminar's) notions, you can read the acid between the lines.<br />One thing that bothers me is that Ehrman tries so hard not to step on any toes.  Several times he reassures the reader that it's not his intention to put-down one's religious views; he's only looking at things from a purely historical view.  After the in your face, love it or leave it approach of Crossnan and his ilk, this is admittedly a preferable tone, but still, Ehrman almost seems to pussy-foot around certain issues.<br />What makes this my favorite historical Jesus book is the freshness Ehrman breathes into these well-told tales.  It also serves as a great refresher course.  With only a few sentences and paragraphs, Ehrman conveys what other, less-skilled scholars might take several volumes to get across.  Ehrman also has me believing his thesis, that Jesus believed the end was coming, if not within his own lifetime, then within the lifetime of his followers - and, after he and his followers were gone but the Earth still remained, Christian copyists inserted words into his mouth, lessening the apocalypsis of his preachings.ention to put-down one's religious views; he's only looking at things from a purely historical view.

US	52938460	RMAR4UDWLBAMP	0679735259	135528120	Dispatches	Books	5	63	68	N	N	Apocalypse Now, the book	Maybe it's because Michael Herr wrote the narration for the film, but reading Dispatches, you can't help but feel that you're getting another peek into the thoughts of Martin Sheen's character Captain Willard, from Apocalypse Now.  Willard if he was wimpier, actually; Herr makes no bones about the fact that he was scared out of his wits throughout most of his stay in Vietnam.  One of the pieces in Dispatches, \\"Illumination Rounds,\\" really slams this point home; Herr comes off like a paranoid wreck in it.<br />Beyond that, Herr's writing is almost poetic.  His descriptions of the war and the men who fought in it are impressive, borderline masterly.  In addition he throws off gems of impromptu character studies, almost throw-away sentences that describe the very core of the soldiers he met.  One of my favorite lines that Herr wrote for Apocalypse Now is when Willard meets the PBR crew; he says they're \\"rock and rollers, with one foot in their graves.\\"  Dispatches is filled to the brim with such lines, and if you enjoyed Martin Sheen's voice-over in the Coppola film, you'll really enjoy this book.<br />I've read Dispatches a few times, and each time I've taken something new from it.  The \\"Khe Sanh\\" section is obviously the centerpiece of the book; it dwarfs all of the other stories.  Stuck in the bombed-out, besieged base, Herr effectively conveys the sense of doom and paranoia that gripped the Marines trapped inside.  This section features one of the more memorable soldiers in the book, the black Marine Day Tripper, as well as a mysterious grenade launcher who provided the inspiration for the character Roach in Apocalypse Now.  In fact, the \\"Khe Sanh\\" article, as it originally appeared in magazine form, was a prime source of inspiration for John Milius, when he was writing the Apocalypse Now script in 1969.<br />There are a host of intriguing characters in this book.  My favorite is cast aside quickly, however: a drugged-out LURP who appears briefly in the opening chapter, \\"Breathing In.\\"  Herr apparently was too frightened of this guy to get closer to him, so all we get in Dispatches is an intriguing glimpse.  We do get to see more of Herr's colleagues, though, such as Errol Flynn's son Sean, who treats the war like a day at the park, riding to and from battles on a motorcycle.<br />Readers looking for detailed combat description are out of luck.  In fact, it appears that Herr didn't see much fighting at all.  At least, if he did, he doesn't mention it.  Instead, what you find in Dispatches are illuminating reports from the front lines, insightful character studies of the men who fought and died.  You also get a heavy dose of the pop culture of the time: the spirit of Morrison and Hendrix and Zappa so permeate every page that you can almost hear their music blaring in the background.<br />So, just as Apocalypse Now rises above being just another \\"war\\" film by mostly not being about the war at all, Dispatches rises above your average combat journalism.  Instead, it comes off as a moment in time, caught and contained forever in text.  It is to be read first and foremost by those who wish to understand Vietnam, the mindset of the men who fought there.  It's also just a plain engrossing read.pter, \\"Breathing In.\\"  Herr apparently was too frightened of this guy to get closer to him, so all we get in Dispatches is an intriguing glimpse.

I collected and read them religiously from ages 10-17, but pretty much quit cold turkey, other than the occasional, brief period of renewed interest.  When I saw the first X-Men movie, I was impressed that the producers were able to make these previously-byzantine characters accessible and cool.  I picked up one of the countless monthly X-Men titles, to see if their creators were keeping up with this standard.  Of course, they weren't; but a few months after the movie, Grant Morrison took over the New X-Men series, and in many ways the comic became more cool than the movie itself.<br />Morrison is a good writer, and his Invisibles series is one of the few that I've read all of the way through.  One thing that always gets me is that Morrison is one of those guys who thinks he's too cool for his own good; while this came off as grating in his previous books, it mostly works with the X-Men.  Maybe it's due to the way he reimagined a previously-boring character: Cyclops, refashioned by Morrison and incredible artist Frank Quitely, is now a leather-wearing bad-ass who, in my book, looks cooler than Wolverine will ever be.  Morrison saves most of his best lines for Emma Frost however, a new addition to the X-Men roster whom most fans will love.  Another character Morrison introduces to the X-roster is  Xorn, a mutant healer who looks like the mascot for a heavy metal band.<br />This hardback book collects Morrison's first year on the title, along with the 2001 annual.  The stories are generally arranged in arcs, with the last one, Imperial, mostly the best.  One thing the book suffers from is the lack of Quitely; the man takes so long to draw a page that Marvel must always have back-up pencilers in the wings.  And the unfortunate thing is that one of these back-ups, Igor Kordey, is perhaps one of the sloppiest artists I've seen.  The occasional page is okay, but in general Kordey can make the average character look like a monstrous ghoul.  The other back-up, Ethan Van Sciver, is mostly very good, but incomparable to Frank Quitely.  Quitely draws half of the stories in this collection, though, and his work here is among his best, just as good as his art in Morrison's Flex Mentallo mini-series.<br />Morrison's stories are great for readers new to the X-Men.  In fact, his goal seems to have been grabbing the attention of fans of the film, people who had just been introduced to the characters and might like to see something more of them.  You don't need to know very much about the X-Men's history at all; a nice change from the old days, in which you had to keep up with countless back issues just to understand one page of the current issue.  Morrison's stories do in fact feature subplots that carry from one story arc to the next, but the main storyline always predominates.<br />In short, the issues featured in this hardback are cinematic and feel like the two X-Men movies on paper.  In fact, Morrison's stories are more edgy than future films could possibly ever hope to be.  So even if this isn't on the same level as near-literary masterworks like Alan Moore's Watchmen or Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, Morrison's 2001-2002 run on the New X-Men is great reading for X-film fans who wouldn't be caught dead in a comic store.ul.

Like its predecessor, \\"The Short-Timers,\\" The Phantom Blooper is comprised of three novellas, but each seem to have been written by a different author.  The first, \\"The Winter Soldiers,\\" is just as great as anything in \\"The Short-Timers;\\" the second, \\"Travels with Charlie,\\" comes off like \\"Dances with Wolves\\" in Vietnam; and the third, \\"The Proud Flesh,\\" almost reads like a political book, with long diatribes against the US government.  In short, it's an unfocused novel that might not only grate readers with its unwillingness to be \\"The Short-Timers, Part Two,\\" but also with its heavy anti-US politics sentiment.<br />What most frustrates me is that the first novella in the book is so promising.  In fact, I enjoyed it more than anything in \\"The Short-Timers.\\"  Starting off with rumors and legends about the Phantom Blooper, it features an apocalyptic, night-time battle that is beyond any of the action in the previous novel.  However, the second novella, \\"Travels with Charlie,\\" abandons the characters and writing style Hasford previously employed, and instead, as another reviewer so accurately depicted it, comes off as Snow White with guns.  Perhaps my main problem with this section of the novel is that I just don't buy it.<br />It's hard to believe that a village of Viet Cong would so readily accept a US Marine as one of their own.  I can't recall reading about any real-world American POW's in the Vietnam war who experienced the idyllic, almost hippie-like existence Joker enjoys; it seems to me that most US prisoners were too busy being abused and tortured by their Viet Cong captors.  And it also rubs me the wrong way that Hasford can have the VC commit atrocious acts, yet for them it's justified, whereas when he has US soldiers commit atrocities, it's just because they're basically inhuman.  Hasford doesn't paint a very balanced picture, and though he dedicates this book to veterans of the war, he portrays the US soldiers as murdering, uncaring monsters.  I can't imagine too many vets who would be flattered by their representation in this novel.<br />Another thing is that the Joker who narrates this novel is very different from the Joker we knew in \\"The Short-Timers.\\"  Gone is the stone-cold view of the world.  Instead, the Joker of the Phantom Blooper is a caring guy, who seems to just want to live off the land for the rest of his life.  This is totally against the grain of the blank-slate Joker in the previous book.  It really seems to me, especially in the second and third novellas, that Hasford mostly just used Joker to promote his own opinions.<br />Whereas the previous novel had several interesting characters, with even more interesting names, The Phantom Blooper only features a few.  In particular there's Black John Wayne, in \\"The Winter Soldiers,\\" a black activist Marine who protests the war and refuses to fight.  To tell the truth, I would've preferred to have seen more of this character than just about anything in either \\"Travels with Charlie\\" or \\"The Proud Flesh.\\"  Fans of the first novel may feel a bit let down that we barely get to see any of the characters from \\"The Short-Timers.\\"  Even Animal Mother, who most people know from his appearance in \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" only gets a small mention, in the beginning and end of the novel.<br />In short, I would say this book should be read by those who enjoyed \\"The Short-Timers.\\"  However, I wouldn't say that it's necessary for anyone else, unless you want to read an unusual novel about the Vietnam War, one that offers a very different message from any other.he US soldiers as murdering, uncaring monsters.

US	52938460	R50CANO563GWO	0553279459	961266186	The Short-Timers	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Flawless novel of the Vietnam War	This must be the best Vietnam War novel I've read.  It's a perfect piece of literature.  The writing is incredible.  Poetic, sharp, and to the point.  I've read great things about Stephen Wright's \\"Meditations in Green\\" and O'Brien's \\"Going After Cacciato.\\"  I've read both of those books.  They're excellent, but neither of them hold a candle to Gustav Hasford's The Short-Timers.  The irony being, of course, that this novel is little-known, and not even in print.<br />Written from the point of view of combat journalist Corporal Joker, the book reads as if it's narrated by one of the Marines Michael Herr followed around in \\"Dispatches.\\"  That same dark sense of humor is in place, that same tone of voice that one moment is expounding on something profound, the next joking about something mundane.  Hasford was a vet, he was a Marine in the middle of it all, and his words drip with realism.  But there is a surreal aspect to the book as well, as is expected from any Vietnam novel worth its salt.  The fate of Rafter Man, as well as the delusional sequence in which Joker believes he's been killed, are macabre bits of surrealism that leave a lasting impression.<br />The book is spilt into three connected novellas.  The first two, \\"Spirit of the Bayonet\\" and \\"Body Count,\\" were adapted by Stanley Kubrick for his film \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\"  However, the final novella in the book, \\"Grunts,\\" which details Joker's experiences in the besieged Khe Sahn base, rivals the Do Lung Bridge sequence in \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" and it's a shame Kubrick didn't include this section in his movie.<br />To increase the impact of the prose, Hasford writes in present-tense.  His sentences are lean and mean, making the book a quick read (it's also very short).  All of this just makes me scratch my head.  Hasford was obviously a talented writer.  The novel reminds me of Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" not due to content, but due to the quality of writing, a perfect mixture of modicum and depth.  So why did Hasford die in obscurity?  There's just no justice.<br />The only recent author I could compare to Hasford would be Thom Jones, who includes several excellent Vietnam short stories in his three collections (i.e., \\"The Pugilist at Rest,\\" etc).  Jones, though, mostly writes character pieces; with Hasford, you not only get that, but also extremely realistic and bloody action sequences.  Simply put, he's a great, forgotten author, and his books need to be put back into print, as soon as possible.id Hasford die in obscurity?

US	52938460	R1PSMWEZRQELF9	0306810468	742694223	The Apocalypse Now Book	Books	4	29	30	N	N	A wealth of information, with some glaring omissions	Talk about bad timing.  After years waiting for a good Apocalypse Now book, Peter Cowie's comes out, right around the same time as \\"Apocalypse Now Redux.\\"  The irony being that Cowie wrote the book in 2000, a full year before Coppola unveiled his reworked masterpiece.  This means that, due to how long the publishing process takes, the book has hardly any information about Redux, which is a shame.  As Cowie's interview with Coppola took place in 1999, there are no quotes or thoughts from the director about what lead him to create Redux.<br />That being said, the rest of the book is very informative, in some cases too informative.  The background, pre-production detail is nearly staggering.  I would have liked to have learned more about screenwriter John Milius' original script idea, \\"The Psychedelic Soldier,\\" which, after he was inspired by the idea to do a modern tribute to Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" became Apocalypse Now.  Cowie, however, does do a great job of mentioning many of the early drafts of the script, even quoting from the rarely-seen first draft, in which the VC speak in goofy subtitles, and Colonel Kilgore is known as Colonel Kharnage.<br />The level of research Cowie has performed leaves me wondering over many glaring omissions.  For example, the highlight of the book is a chapter titled \\"Buried Treasure,\\" in which Cowie goes over the 5 ½ hour work print.  Though he gives detailed descriptions of the major scenes that are in the work print, but were not included in the original version (or the Redux), there's no mention of the Photojournalist's death scene, which is a major revelation of the work print.  Likewise, Cowie doesn't mention how deadly Martin Sheen's Willard is in the work print; for example, in it he kills a child in the climax.<br />Cowie also fails to cover little bits and pieces that are interesting in the film.  For example, he doesn't mention that Lee Ermey, who would later make film history as the drill instructor in \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" plays one of Kilgore's helicopter pilots, during the beach raid sequence.  And there is no detail about what scenes, exactly, Harvey Keitel filmed during the few weeks he spent on the set.  But these little matters are trivial.  The fact is, the book is a pretty good compendium of information about my favorite movie.  There are no color photos, but there are some nice behind-the-scenes shots and stills, including a very nice one of Willard's head coming out of the swamp, enshrouded in fog.<br />The main thing I found interesting in the book was that cinematographer Storaro advised Coppola to end the movie on a pessimistic note.  Watching one of the early edits, Storaro urged Coppola to integrate the scenes of Willard hacking at Kurtz with the caribou sacrifice, as well as the shots of Kurtz's compound exploding.  The way Storaro envisioned it, Willard would kill Kurtz at the exact same time as the air strike, which would obliterate all of them.  A very dark ending, but Coppola obviously didn't like it.  The footage of Kurtz's compound being destroyed, by the way, is included as an extra on the Apocalypse Now (original version) DVD.acket,\\" plays one of Kilgore's helicopter pilots, during the beach raid sequence.

Books	5	4	5	N	N	Fascinating look at early Christianity	A long-time reader of \\"historical Jesus\\" books, and books on the early Christians, I was surprised to discover this book, which somehow slipped under my radar. Usually I'm skeptical of books that try to prove that Jesus never existed; even Time magazine recently declared that \\"most intelligent people no longer question if Jesus actually existed,\\" or something to that effect. However, that Jesus was a literary hybrid of Osirus-Dionysus and the Jewish Messiah is authors Freke and Gandy's theory, and they propose this theory so convincingly and meticulously that I was hard-put to think of a solid argument.<br />The similarities between the ancient Osirus-Dionysus-Mithra mystery religions and early Christianity can not be denied, and shall prove to be startling to the fundamentalist Christian. What's even more startling is that these similarities were well-known to ancient pagans; in fact, several of them wrote treatises in which they put down the Christians for \\"stealing from\\" other religions! Many of these sources are painstakingly cited by the authors; likewise, they cite countless sources that justify their theory of a mystical Christ.<br />One thing that concerns me is that the authors do not mention James Morgan Pryse; perhaps they just aren't aware of this author's works. Pryse unveiled all of the \\"secrets\\" Freke and Gandy expound in the Jesus Mysteries almost a hundred years ago: his \\"Apocalypse Unsealed\\" and \\"Restored New Testament\\" not only promote the theory that Jesus didn't exist and was merely a mystical allusion, but also go about proving as much, by revealing hidden, gnostic themes in the gospels themselves.<br />It seems that most of the negative reviews on here come from those who disagree with the authors's contention, that Jesus did not exist.  Though this theory has been advanced in the past (i.e., via James Morgan Pryse, Earl Doherty, and many others), the basic assumption made by most scholars is that Jesus in fact did exist.  Freke and Gandy, however, choose to stick with their thesis, and their boldness is to be admired.  However, I also suspect that they are so resolute because they desired the publicity such a claim would no doubt gain (it worked).<br />The authors might have been better off postulating that Jesus did live, but his life story was mutated by a batch of Hellenized Jews, which grafted fragments from various Pagan Mystery rites onto his story.  This theory is even offered by Robert Eisenman, in his magnum opus on the historical Jesus, \\"James the Brother of Jesus.\\"<br />In any case, I found this book to be very readable and enlightening.  It's one that the reader can return to several times.  Though Freke and Gandy aren't your typical \\"scholars,\\" they are still to be admired for the depth and focus of their research.

It could have at least contained one of the later Milius/Coppola rewrites, such as the final revised 1975 version, which is easily found online.  The simple fact is, those scripts provide a better reading experience; you're better off just watching the movie than reading this one.  And, if you're a fledgling screenwriter, you're certainly not going to learn anything about the craft of scriptwriting from this book.<br />The reason being, as any viewer of the excellent documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" knows, is that Coppola basically gave his actors free reign in expanding and ad-libbing their dialog on the set.  Having read the earlier Milius/Coppola rewrites, I know that a lot of the lines in Apocalypse Now were in fact from the script.  But many more of them (particularly Brando and Hopper's dialog) were in fact made up by the actors themselves.  So to publish this book and say that it's a pure creation of Milius and Coppola is a bit misleading (something which Coppola himself vaguely asserts in his introduction).<br />A straight-up publication of an earlier version would have been preferable, if for the simple fact that it would give amazing insight into the twisted path this film took, from script to celluloid.  For example, the '75 version mentioned above (the script Coppola started with on the set, but eventually rewrote day by day) not only opened with a psychedelic action scene, it also ended with one: a surreal, apocalyptic (of course) set-piece that involved untold VC, rampant destruction, and drugged-out GI's, with \\"Light My Fire\\" blaring over humongous stereos.  It's interesting to imagine what the movie would've been like, had Coppola stuck with this ending, though from the beginning he claimed he had a problem with it; he found it too much like a comic book.  Still, many have complained that the ending of Coppola's actual film is a bit underwhelming; there are many who would have in fact preferred the climactic sequence Milius envisioned.  As for myself, I like both.<br />There are other interesting differences in the early Milius/Coppola drafts.  For example, Willard is more of a devil-may-care super-soldier; he shares his joints with the PBR crew, and takes easily to murder: in one well-written sequence, Willard, realizing the French Plantation owners are attempting to trick him out of crucial fuel and ammo supplies, fools them by murdering some Vietnamese guards and planting their bodies in empty supply crates - crates which the French believe contain fuel and ammo.  Kurtz as well is different, a blond-haired he-man who kills hundreds of VC single-handedly.  Hardly the character Marlon Brando played in the film!<br />Actually, it's unfair of me to review these earlier incarnations of the script.  The fact is, the version published here is far removed from them.  But even though I'm unimpressed with this book, I still can't give it a poor review; even though it's mostly just a transcription, still, it's a transcription of my favorite movie, so that means it can't be ALL bad.s a bit underwhelming; there are many who would have in fact preferred the climactic sequence Milius envisioned.

It could provide the jolt that most other Japanese films lack.  A surreal, over-the-top, blackly humorous and violent saga, Bakune Young is far removed from any other manga I've read.  Unlike boy-fantasies like \\"Guyver\\" or \\"Fist of the North Star,\\" Bakune Young doesn't have any heroic characters, it represents life as a slap to the face, and generally the worst things that can happen normally do.  It also has a hectic, blood-spattered pace.<br />Bakune's an ox of a character, with the brain to match.  He stomps through this volume like an unstoppable monster, oblivious and uncaring of the damage he causes.  First beating a yakuza thug senseless, Bakune proceeds to wage a war on the mafia, taking the Don of Nippon hostage and holing himself up in the Osaka Castle.  A colorful group of characters try to stop him, including a goofy pair of cops, a multitude of the Don's henchmen, and Bakune's former gym coach, whose face is \\"deformed with anger\\" at the memory of the humiliation Bakune put him through.<br />My favorite character is probably Johnson Membodeath, a French (?) ninja who appears in the succeeding volumes, as well.  Johnson has a knack for going buck-wild and attacking anyone in his way, at any given moment.  A fearsome character, but still no match for the Hulk-like Bakune.<br />The artwork is a match for Bakune's mentality.  It's harsh and jagged, the work of a deranged child.  Like something Bakune himself would draw.  Generally I like crisp and detailed art, but here the rough penciling only adds to the book's charm.  (I should mention that the artwork gets better with each volume, with volume 3 being exceptionally good.)<br />Highly recommended for fans of Japanese/Hong Kong cinema, Quentin Tarantino's movies, dark humor, and the violently absurd.  And it just gets better with the next two volumes.h for the Hulk-like Bakune.<br />The artwork is a match for Bakune's mentality.  It's harsh and jagged, the work of a deranged child.

The first half of the book almost reads like a few short stories, linked by Parker's on-going search for someone who tried to kill him.  We follow along as Parker goes from one botched job to the next, all the while waiting for any information that will bring him closer to his target.<br />Once that thread's taken care of, the second half of the book kicks in, and here Parker almost becomes a secondary character.  We meet and follow his associates in an art heist, one which starts off fairly well but goes downhill fast.  The mob gets involved, and Parker has to figure out a way to get out with both some money and his life.<br />A quick, enjoyable read, but more of a dark comedy than a crime caper.  Doesn't have nearly as much action as \\"Slayground,\\" but then again it has a more dynamic narrative.	2003-01-22

Here's what I've gleaned from King's notes in \\"Nightmares & Dreamscapes,\\" as well as from interviews he's done over the years:<br />In the early `80s, King was working on a crime novel that he intended to publish under his Richard Bachman pseudonym.  The novel was going to be titled \\"My Pretty Pony,\\" and it was about an independent hit man named Clive Banning.  In the story, Banning was hired to gather together a group of fellow hit men for a big job.  Their mission was to kill a large gathering of mob bosses, who would all be attending a wedding.  Banning and his men perform the job, only for Banning's clients to pull a double-cross.  First they kill off Banning's associates one by one, and then they come for Banning himself.<br />Apparently King completed six chapters of the novel, one of which was a flashback of Banning's to a time when he was a young boy, and his grandfather told him about the nature of time.  This chapter was eventually published independently under the title \\"My Pretty Pony,\\" appearing in both an expensive, limited-edition pressing, and \\"Nightmares & Dreamscapes.\\"<br />Thinking the novel itself wasn't any good (which is a shame, because it sounds excellent), King lost interest in writing it.  Apparently he toyed with the idea of re-writing it and publishing it as \\"Machine's Way,\\" under the name \\"George Stark,\\" which was - get this - RICHARD BACHMAN'S pseudonym.  I guess King eventually came back to his senses, and dropped this idea as well; having a pseudonym for your pseudonym is a little psychotic.  It was around this time that King was discovered to be Bachman, and he dropped the idea entirely for a few years.<br />Finally, King decided to combine all of these divergent stories into a straight-up horror novel that would also deal with authors and their pseudonyms.  Making George Stark the crime-writing pseudonym of his main character, literary author Thad Beaumont, King used portions of the \\"My Pretty Pony\\" novel (including the gory wedding hit) as excerpts from Stark's novels.  Ever since I first read The Dark Half when it was published, these excerpts have been my favorite part of the book.  This just makes me wish all the more that King would've just finished, and published, \\"My Pretty Pony\\" in the early `80s.  The man has a great crime novel in him, and this could've been it.  It's unfortunate that he decided it wasn't up to par.<br />As for the Dark Half itself, it's actually one of King's better horror novels.  The idea of an evil pseudonym who somehow comes to life and wreaks havoc was obviously vivid in King's mind, and it comes across so on page.  King intended to have the book published as a collaboration between himself and Richard Bachman, which is such a goofy idea that it's actually pretty neat.  King's publisher's rejected the idea, though, and all Bachman got was an acknowledgement on the dedication page.<br />In a confusing side-note, King stated in an interview in the early `90s that he was going to publish a novel called \\"Steel Machine,\\" which is the novel Thad and Stark collaborate on in the end of The Dark Half (we get to read pieces of it in the book).  Apparently King's publisher came up with the idea of King writing one of the George Stark books himself, and in this interview King claimed it would be \\"Steel Machine.\\"  However, in the Notes section of \\"Nightmares & Dreamscapes,\\" King states that the George Stark book he was going to write after giving up on \\"My Pretty Pony\\" was \\"Machine's Way.\\"  But regardless, I think it's too late, the time's passed, and I doubt we'll ever see any of these novels, whether \\"Steel Machine\\" or a completed \\"My Pretty Pony,\\" in print.used portions of the \\"My Pretty Pony\\" novel (including the gory wedding hit) as excerpts from Stark's novels.

US	52938460	RPTE7Z7NSG48R	0380688662	393729072	Slayground	Books	4	3	4	N	N	If Lee Marvin had starred in Beverly Hills Cop 3	Beverly Hills Cop 3 is also known as \\"Die Hard in an amusement park,\\" due to the climactic battle in which Eddie Murphy, holed up in a deserted amusement park, takes on a tide of villains.  I don't know if the filmmakers realized it, but this is the same plot as Richard Stark's Slayground, published in 1971.<br />The narrative is as linear as an old pulp novel.  The book opens with an armored truck robbery that quickly goes wrong.  Parker, alone, escapes with a satchel of money by climbing the fence of a nearby amusement park, which is closed for the winter.  Parker walks right into a meeting between a local mob boss and a few crooked cops.  Parker escapes into the park, only to find there's no other way out.  And he can't just leave, because he knows those mobsters out there will be waiting for him.  He also knows that soon enough they'll realize he's the robber being mentioned in the news reports, the robber who has seventy grand on him.  So Parker sets up as many traps as he can in the park.  That night the mobsters come in after him, and what follows is a nail-biting thriller that would be fit for the screen, if not for its single-track mind and lack of subplot.  It's survival of the fittest all the way, as Parker does whatever he can to [detour] anyone who comes after him, and escape with his life.<br />The novel itself doesn't start out so linear, as first we follow Parker through his botched robbery, and then we go back to before the robbery, and meet each of the mobsters and crooked cops.  Once these pleasantries are out of the way, it's straight-up action and adventure time.  Parker is his usual cold, calculating, monosyllabic self, and the assortment of mobsters and cops after him are each well-drawn and memorable.  There are also several reversals and surprises strewn through the plot, such as when Parker \\"lucks out\\" and kills the last person you'd expect him to.  However, what at first seemed like a lucky break soon turns out to be Parker's misfortune.<br />All in all, Slayground is an entertaining, quick read, but has apparently not yet been reprinted.  I'd suggest finding a copy at your local library, instead of paying a fortune for a used edition.r />All in all, Slayground is an entertaining, quick read, but has apparently not yet been reprinted.

Roadwork starts off suspensefully, as a crazed man with a knack for carrying on conversations with himself buys a high-caliber rifle and a .44 Magnum revolver.  However, the explosive result of this purchase, which you might expect to be soon coming, doesn't arrive until the very end of the book.  To get there, we must wade through some very dense, overly-detailed (but very well written) exposition.<br /><br />Bart Dawes has finally been pushed too far; at age 40, he's lost his only son to a brain tumor, and now the public works commission has decided to build a new highway system, which will not only go through (and thereby erase) the building Bart's worked in for the past twenty years, but also his home.  Bart must move, but he refuses to.  In the process, Bart will lose his job, his friends, his wife, and his sanity, but he stands strong in his refusal to leave his home, reminiscent in a way of Hank Stamper in Ken Kesey's \\"Sometimes a Great Notion.\\"<br /><br />Roadwork is different than anything Stephen King (well, Richard Bachman, to be precise) has written; it's more a character study than anything else.  As King himself wrote in his \\"Why I Was Bachman\\" introduction to the first edition of The Bachman Books, \\"Roadwork is probably the worst of the lot, because it tries so hard to be good.\\"  And that's the whole of it: Roadwork reads like it's been written by a young writer who's trying hard to appeal to the literary crowd.  It's verbose, packed with introspection, and moves along at a snail's pace; the total opposite of the Bachman/King extravaganza The Running Man.<br /><br />It's no surprise that King relates that Roadwork was written at a time when he was trying to impress those elitists whom would ask him at cocktail parties if he'd ever write \\"something important.\\"  (Interestingly, in the second edition of the Bachman Books, in a foreword titled \\"The Importance of Being Bachman,\\" King states that Roadwork is now his favorite of the Bachman bunch.)<br /><br />This is not to say Roadwork is a bad book, or even a boring book.  It takes dedication to keep turning those pages when you begin reading it, but in time you adjust to the casual pace of the narrative, you begin to learn (and respect) who Bart Dawes is, and you root for him, no matter how nuts he's become.<br /><br />The ending finally picks up the pace, as Dawes accepts his fate and brings those guns into play, as well as a generous supply of explosives.  In that regard, Roadwork packs the suspenseful punch you'd normally associate with the books under Richard Bachman's name.  But with its slow pace, grim view on the world (the Bachman view is generally that life sucks, and terrible things happen for no reason), combined with its firm rooting in the 1970s (which might make it inaccessible to those who weren't around in that decade), Roadwork might not appeal to the average King/Bachman fan.  However, for those looking for an intense character study that slowly builds to an explosive climax, it comes recommended.ork is a bad book, or even a boring book.

US	52938460	R31C6JYD1OOSJT	0451197968	321732450	The Running Man	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Fast-paced action, one of Bachman's best	I've read online reviews of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's novel The Running Man, and some of them claim that this book lacks a certain something that relegates it to being the worst of the Bachman Books.  For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would think that.  As far as I'm concerned, The Running Man is not only one of Bachman/King's best books, it's one of the best straight-up action novels I've had the pleasure to read.<br />When you think about it, there are a ton of action movies out there, but not very many action novels.  Sure, you have a plethora of low-grade action series, such as Mack Bolan, Remo Williams, etc, but there aren't very many stand-alone, pure action novels.  The Running Man is one, though, and from beginning to end it's a thrill a minute.<br />I grew up in the `80s, and of course loved the Schwarzenegger film, loosely based on this book.  Matter of fact, I still do.  But the movie just doesn't compare; whereas it's goofy, WWF-type fun, the novel is dark, brutal, and brimming with mean-spirited, hardcore action.  Ben Richards, the scrawny, underfed, cynical protagonist of the novel, is a far cry from Schwarzenegger's he-man.  This is one of the best features of the novel, witnessing the \\"pre-tubercular\\" Richards (per King's description, in his \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" foreword) take on the forces sent against him.<br />According to King, the novel was written over a 72-hour period, and the published version supposedly isn't much different than that first draft.  This speed of writing is reflected in the novel: it chugs along like a No Doze-popping trucker.  Whereas most King novels are bogged down by excessive description and detail (something King is normally criticized for by the literary critics), The Running Man  is a trim, fat-free exercise in the concept of \\"less is more.\\"  A grander scheme (and theme) is hinted at in the subtext of the book, but like all good novels, it isn't beaten over your head; the story itself is the star, and after reading it you'll reflect on the little details ingrained within.<br />Since this is a Richard Bachman novel, expect his trademark, downer ending.  However, the ride there is exciting and excellent, and this is one of the few Bachman/King books I would consider re-reading in the future.  The novel begs for a more faithful film adaptation; the modicum of description, the streamlined action and characters, and the black humor dripping from the dialog all make the book read like a well-done, action-packed screenplay.<br />It's never been considered a part of the subgenre, but I think The Running Man is an early example of what has become known as cyberpunk.  Though it doesn't feature the trademarks normally associated with the genre, such as computers and hackers, the atmosphere in which the novel takes place - a grim, technology-ravaged, depressing world in which a large wall separates the rich from the poor, and the media reigns supreme - could come straight out of William Gibson, or even the film \\"Blade Runner.\\"<br />Simply put, The Running Man comes highly recommended, whether you're an action fan, a King aficionado, or even if you're looking for an introduction to the world of Stephen King/Richard Bachman.is the star, and after reading it you'll reflect on the little details ingrained within. <br />Since this is a Richard Bachman novel, expect his trademark, downer ending.

But Price's commentaries on these two Gospels are the main factor in this book.  He utilizes something that's missing from the &quot;detective kits&quot; of most other Biblical scholars: common sense.  I've read a great majority of the books on the &quot;Historical Jesus,&quot; each of which - as the old saying goes - reveals more about the author than the subject.  Instead of going off into groundless supposition, as most other Historical Jesus questors are known to do, Price gives us the evidence that we have and makes common sense conclusions on who wrote the Gospels: when, where, how, and why.  He doesn't make any mention of the so-called &quot;Secret&quot; Gospel of Mark, true; but I think this is less Price being unaware of it and more of him just realizing it's a phony and unworthy of mention.  Read Akenson's Saint Saul, which brutally brings this forgery to light.  Price's extra Gospel, which he wrote himself, is interesting, but ultimately the selling point of this book are his commentaries to the two ancient Gospels themselves.	2001-03-30

First, he proves Morton Smith's &quot;Secret&quot; Gospel of Mark to be an outright fraud - a fraud that the Jesus Seminar have yet to realize it for.  Next he ridicules the attempts to backdate the writing of Gnostic texts such as the Gospel of Thomas to dates as early as Mark itself.  This is something else the Jesus Seminar is quite fond of doing.  Finally he tears into the overblown &quot;Q Gospel&quot; issue.  Akenson writes with a great, biting wit throughout the book, and his debunking of current trends and myths in the Historical Jesus quest alone are enough to recommend the book.  However, Akenson's writing also lacks a certain rhythm.  Countless times he'll be writing about something, getting to the point, and then he'll go off into a tangent, either offering a short history lesson or a commentary on why he's come to believe what he does...then finally he will get to the point, several pages later.  Also he stresses too much the destruction of Jerusalem's Second Temple; you only have to write that it was the equal of a nuclear blast once, Dr. Akenson.  We get the point!  Many scholars, Akenson included, believe that the Gospels are suspect because they were written after the Temple's destruction, which scattered the early Christians and no doubt affected their world-view.  One thing I've never seen mentioned by any writer is that perhaps the Gospels were written precisely BECAUSE of the Temple's destruction; the early Christians realized that their flock was spreading, and so came to the decision that the life and lessons of their teacher needed to be written down, so that his word would be spread wherever his followers went.  As for Akenson's actual dissection of Paul's letters, it takes him quite some time to get to it, and in all reality Akenson doesn't shed much new light on the Historical Jesus.  Early First Century Jerusalem is a murky, far-away place, and we're never going to know all we want to about it, or the people who lived in it.  But again, this book is recommendable not so much for the study of Paul's letters, but for Akenson's commentary on the problems with the current quest for the Historical Jesus.time to get to it, and in all reality Akenson doesn't shed much new light on the Historical Jesus.

Yon is long-winded and his story is aimless.  An editor was most definitely needed for this book.  But there is something else I noticed.  Yon writes about all of these people who have given him a hard time in life; bullies, if you will.  From kids at school to the guy he accidentally killed in a bar.  All of these people, Yon writes, just attacked him for no reason.  As far as Yon is concerned, they were just jerks out looking for a fight, and he was an innocent lamb who had to defend himself.  However, this is the same man who writes that he decided at one point to ignore anyone whose intelligence he felt didn't match his own, the same man who threw rocks at cars as a child for fun, the same man who perpetrated more practical jokes in high school than an entire detention class of pranksters.  Yon's writing reveals him to be  opinionated and slighly arrogant.  Who's to say he isn't like this in person?  Who's to say he didn't bring all of these bully attacks upon himself?  That's the main thing I noticed from this book.  Other than that, it's the usual motivational junk.  Yon has been through some hard times and I feel badly for him, and also respect him for getting through them, but still, an editor really needed to take a pair of scissors to large sections of this book.	2001-03-05

Why?  Because this is the only writing book you'll ever need.  So if you had it, you wouldn't have to spend your money on books like &quot;How to write a best-selling novel in 5 minutes&quot; or &quot;YOU can write a classic,&quot; or other such stupid &quot;guides,&quot; which usually are written by authors who have nothing else to their credit.  Why read a book that claims it will show you how to write a best-seller, when the author himself hasn't written a best-seller?  Gary Provost doesn't claim that he'll help you write a best-seller, he merely claims that he will help make you a better writer.  And if you read the book, follow his instructions, and practice, you will become one.  Provost wasn't a best-seller himself, and most of his books are out of print, but that doesn't matter.  What matters is, he knew what makes good writing, and what makes writing work.  And more importantly, he knew how to TEACH these principles.  Hopefully one day this will be back in print.  Until then, scour the used bookstores until you find a copy.  You will be very glad you did.	2001-01-31

It will definitely open your eyes to many things, but I doubt it will make you want to toss your television out the window.  After all, if this book makes you do that, then you are just as &quot;impressionable&quot; as the TV slaves the book derides.  And that's the funny thing about this book.  It claims that TV is bad because it will rot your brain and tell you what you should think; then the book TELLS you to throw away your TV.  Basically what I am saying is, this book is just as opinionated and commanding as the industry it is trying to lambaste.  Read the book and see what you think.  Let it open your eyes, but don't let it change your life.

Pryse shows how all of the symbols and mysterious figures in The Apocalypse (666, the Dragon, etc) are really (not so) hidden puzzles and clues, that once discovered and solved will enable the reader to use the book as a helpful guide in conquering the material world.<br /><br />But if this is just a helpful guide, why is it so occultic?  Pryse claims that John knew the church would one day get rid of it's esoteric foundation and become more exoteric - the 1958 discovery of portions of a so-called \\"Secret Gospel\\" of Mark, which was possibly kept hidden by the Church alone prove this, not to mention the Church's total subjugation of the gnostic sects.  So John wrote his book in a code that could be understood by those with the gnosis, the knowledge, and he even made sure that it wouldn't be butchered by future editors by inserting a warning that the text should be left alone, in order to avoid God's wrath.<br /><br />Some of the things Pryse uncovered are very interesting, such as his claim that 666 is nothing but the numerical transliteration of \\"he phren,\\" ancient Greek for \\"the lower mind.\\"  The Lamb, 888, is Iesous (Jesus - be prepared for Pryse's usage of the original Greek names for all New Testament figures), the higher mind, whereas 1,000 is \\"ho nikon,\\" Greek for \\"the conquerer.\\"  There are other numbers besides, such as 777: \\"stauros\\" - the Cross, and Pryse shows that there is a numerical chart hidden in the Apocalypse, showing in numbers the progress of a man's journey, from the lowest reaches of his carnal desires (333, \\"akrasia\\" - sensuality) to his total mastery over them, and return to his true spiritual self - \\"ho nikon,\\" the conquerer.  This number chart is one of the more interesting aspects of the book; ancient Greeks and Hebrews used letters for numbers, and so by figuring out the word equivalents to the numbers in the Apocalypse, and vice versa, Pryse was able to crack one of the book's many codes.<br /><br />As I said, this was written in the early 1900s, and it shows.  Pryse is about as prudish as an old maid.  This book can be read as a code of its own, one which totally sneers at sex.  For Pryse, sex is contemptible and profane; he very much has the celibate attitude of an old-school mystic.  He also has that old-school mystic disregard for women.  In ancient times, women were considered to be the source of all ills, for tempting men away from the pursuit of spirituality.  Pryse is an adherent to this pattern of thought.  For a better, more modern view of Pryse's thoughts, one which refutes his no-sex, anti-women beliefs, I would recommend Michael Wassil's \\"Dance of Ecstacy,\\" which is available for free on-line.  All you have to do is search for it.<br /><br />I could go on about this book...there are so many ideas and information in it that it's hard to grasp until you've read it at least a few times.  It's also hard to explain what Pryse has written, unless you're talking to someone who's read the book.  Also, I don't particularly like Kessinger's version of this; they're just selling a cheap-looking photocopy of the original manuscript.  You might be better off finding a used copy of the original edition, or the 1972 trade paperback re-release, which will look a little better on your bookshelf.sting aspects of the book; ancient Greeks and Hebrews used letters for numbers, and so by figuring out the word equivalents to the numbers in the Apocalypse, and vice versa, Pryse was able to crack one of the book's many codes.<br /><br />As I said, this was written in the early 1900s, and it shows.

Therefore, when Homer composed the Iliad, he didn't worry that his audience might be left hanging by the poem's &quot;abrupt&quot; ending, which occurs directly after the funeral games for Patroclos, with Hector recently dead and Achilles still alive.  Homer's audiences knew all that would happen, and weren't concerned that he left out the death of Achilles, the Trojan horse gambit, and even the fall of Troy itself.  Likewise, his audience wasn't troubled by the fact that the Odyssey begins ten years later, with Odysseus long gone from Troy, and the War but a memory.  Homer's audiences knew all of that, they just wanted to hear a good story.<br />But we need more than that.  It goes without saying that the happenings of the Trojan War are no longer public knowledge; they had even slipped from the public consciousness by the time of Quintus of Smyrna, roughly around the 3rd Century A.D.  A poet of medium talent, Quintus took up the noble task of writing an epic that would bridge the events in the Iliad with those of the Odyssey, hence the title of this work, &quot;What Homer Didn't Tell.&quot;<br />Besides Quintus' annoying, overly-consistent usage of metaphors, there are a few problems with this epic.  For one, there is no central character to identify with.  Whereas the Iliad told the story of Achilles' wrath and the Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus' craftiness in overcoming his many challenges, this story has no central theme, other than constant battle and the eventual fall of Troy.  Several new champions arrive to help the Trojans, kill a bunch of Greeks, and then are killed themselves.  This is the usual pattern for the first few hundred pages; soon after, Odysseus and Diomedes enlist the aid of Achilles' son, who provides the impetus (along with the infamous horse) for Troy's fall.  The funny thing is, Achilles' son is basically Achilles himself, in power, ability, and charisma.  Quintus went a little overboard with this character: he's just as superhuman as his father, and, reading the book, you can't even tell the difference between him and Achilles.<br />As for the characters who appeared in the Iliad, all of their stories are tied up in this.  Odysseus doesn't take that great of a part in the book, other than his contest with Aias and his idea for the horse.  Nestor provides his usal wisdom, we see the ending to the triangle of Paris, Helen, and Menalous, and we see how morbid and joyless Priam has become, now that his son Hector is dead.  Diomedes appears and disappears throughout the book, though, sometimes aiding the Greeks greatly, other times nowhere to be seen: he's set up as almost superhuman in the Iliad, but Quintus diminishes his powers somewhat, so the new heroes he introduces can take the spotlight.<br />All in all, a useful addition to your library if you're into Homer's work, if at least to fill the gap between the Iliad and the Odyssey.  Just understand that Quintus is not nearly the poet that Homer was, and this is through no fault of the translator, who provides his own critical judgement of Quintus' skill in the foreword.  If Quintus had tightened the plot with a lead character, cut out some of his rambling metaphors, and written the events in a manner that made them seem less repetitive, then maybe this book would still be in print and also be better known.us went a little overboard with this character: he's just as superhuman as his father, and, reading the book, you can't even tell the difference between him and Achilles.<br />As for the characters who appeared in the Iliad, all of their stories are tied up in this.

Passing itself off as &quot;The Acid Novel,&quot; it  details the hidden side of the 1960s: Ken Kesey, Jack Kerouac, Neal  Cassady, and Alan Ginsberg were all Government dupes, whether they knew it  or not.  The CIA is behind them all, trying to create a superman through  LSD.  An interesting idea, maybe, but Fahey destroys the entire concept  with his incredibly ham-fisted and labored writing.  Luckily though, he  keeps the book short.  Rumor is that this book was turned down by nearly  every major publisher because they feared it might be incriminating; Fahey  uses the real names of all the dead personages, such as John Kennedy and  Jack Kerouac, etc, but uses fake names for those who are still alive (save  for Hunter Thompson): Ken Kesey becomes Franklin Moore, Alan Ginsberg (who  was alive when this was published) becomes Carlo Marx, etc.  But it's still  obvious who these characters really are, and therein lies the reason behind  the publishers' supposed worry.  I think the real reason this book wasn't  picked up by a major publisher, though, is because it's atrociously  written.  Fahey uses the most hackneyed metaphors and descriptions, and his  grammar isn't the greatest either.  Commas appear to break up sentences  where they aren't even needed, and I feel like I'm reading something by a  junior high student who's really, really trying.  As the book progresses,  what happened in real history is changed around, with Kesey's character  spending time in jail before being abducted by Government operatives whom  intend to erase his existance; a rescue maneuver right out of some lame  action film ensues.  And that's another thing: Fahey throws in these  useless action scenes throughout the book, obviously trying to spice things  up (as if his concept wasn't interesting enough), but these action scenes  just come off as forced and unecessary.  And finally: the About the Author  page, at the very end of the book, which is very obviously written by  Fahey, claims that the author doesn't submit his material to writing  contests because that's not the sort of thing he does, so this is why he's  never won a writing award.  Sure.  Maybe he should start submitting to  them, and when he doesn't win, he can suspect yet another conspiracy, one  which is laboring to keep him out of print, to keep his wild ideas away  from the public eye.

It's very British - it takes place in London, after all  - and makes many references to early '80s musical artists that the modern  reader might never have even heard of.  Plus, the characters don't seem to  have much going on other than their musical preferences.  But despite that,  The Lonely Planet Boy is a pretty entertaining read.  Plus, it's very  short.  Kip Wilson, a shy English youth, discovers rock chanteuse Mina (a  combination of the VU's Nico and the lead singer from Missing Persons),  writes a glowing review of her for the rock magazine that barely employs  him, and soon enough both his writing career and Mina's rock career take  off.  Kip soon becomes nothing more than a slavish fanboy, obsessed with  Mina, even flying to the US out of his own wallet to cover her tour.  It is  here in America that the first of the book's two shocking incidents takes  place; the way Mina shows Kip what she thinks of him was pretty jolting.  The end comes rather quickly after this, and the second devastating act  takes place in the last pages of the book.  These two incidents alone  change the entire tone of the novel, which started off as an almost  nostalgic look at early '80s pop and music journalism, but ends as a grim  reflection on the strange relationship between artist and fan, and how some  fans can become slightly obsessed, even fanatical.  It isn't the feel-good  book of the year, that's for sure, but I got a few chuckles out of it.  Of  course, I got a bunch of laughs out of Moby-Dick, too, so that's not  surprising.	2000-08-02

I'm giving this book 4 stars mainly for the parts that were from the toys' perspectives.  The scene where the cowboys destroy their enemies is great, but the best part of the entire book is when the Action Pack (or whatever  they were called) fights Lord Tyco in an apocalyptic battle which results  in the freeing of daredevil stuntman Dan Occansion from Tyco's mind  control.  After that the toy stories drop by the wayside, and The Toy  Collector becomes just another Gen X tale of sex, drugs, and the search for  something better.  Sure, it's written well, but it's been done to death.  Even the childhood scenes are great, like when the kids try to run away,  and I wish more print had been devoted to that, as well.  But the story of  grownup Jim just didn't do it for me.  He had some funny comments and  thought-provoking musings, but give me a break.  I felt nothing for him.  Mostly because Gunn (the real one, the author) threw too many last-minute  curveballs, like saying how his Dad would beat him, or how he lost one of  his dearest friends.  These revelations come near the very end of the book,  and we're supposed to buy it that they are responsible for the narrator's  current state of affairs.  I didn't buy it.  I wanted more Dan Occansion,  or maybe even more trips to Charlie's Fun Antiques store.  The whole plot  with Evelyn was fairly interesting, but more realistic than anything.  How  many times has it happened to you that you could only think about pursuing  that one girl, only to realize too late that you've made a mistake once  she's yours?  Most other books would've ended with a happy resolution, and  I will give credit to Gunn that this book didn't.  It's ending reminded me  of the film Bringing Out The Dead; like that movie, The Toy Collector ends  on an uncertain note, and you wonder if Gunn (the character) will truly  find what he is so desperately seeking.  But still, I also wonder if I even  really care.	2000-07-25

This is a very thick and heavy book, and looking through it, I can understand how someone might be hesitant to read it - every page is packed with dense text.  No dialog breaks up the long paragraphs; it's almost as  if you're looking at a history book.  And in some ways, that's all Deus Lo  Volt really is.  It's like the history book I always wanted to read.  Whereas the texts you read in school were dry and boring, Connell has  spiced everything up with gory battle descriptions and popular rumors of  the day.  Every Crusade is covered, but most attention is given to the  First and Third, and later on the narrator's experiences in the last  Crusades.  What Connell has done is conglomerate a ton of historical texts  on the Crusades, most notably that of Jean de Joinville, and expanded upon  them.  It's hard to categorize this book.  It isn't a novel and it isn't  history.  I'd say it's something like Truman Capote's In Cold Blood; like  that book, which was deemed creative nonfiction, I'd say Deus Lo Volt is  creative historical nonfiction.  It also has a healthy dose of Cormac  McCarthy-type prose; even Blood Meridian wasn't this descriptive about war  and death.  I also got a good chuckle out of the narrator's zeal; anytime a  Turk is killed, Jean is sure that his soul will go immediately to hell.  And anytime a Crusader falls in battle, his soul immediately ascends to  Heaven, even if he was in the process of pillaging and destroying.  The sad  thing is that these Medieval jokers really believed this was true; I don't  think they really understood the hypocrisy of their war.  In their effort  to &quot;serve&quot; a Christ who preached peace, they murdered hundreds of  thousands and razed most of the Middle East.  But that's not to say the  Turks were completely innocent.  But anyway, that's a historical debate  that's been going on for ages.  The point is, I found this book very  entertaining and rewarding.  The entire First Crusade impressed me the  most, especially when the battle-weary Franks would experience &quot;divine  visitations,&quot; which would increase their desire to capture Jerusalem.  Particularly funny is when one of them discovers what is obviously a  Saracen spear, but claims that a vision told him that it was really the  spear which pierced the side of Christ.  Also, the Templars are featured in  the book, and that's always good.  All things considered, I'd recommend  this book, but only if you're into history, or if you really want to delve  into another time and place.  Because unlike most other &quot;typical&quot;  historical novels, Deus Lo Volt isn't just a period piece, with characters  much like us who just happen to live in the Middle Ages; it is much more  realistic than that, and the characters who populate it and the bloody  events that transpire are very indicitave of the times.  I wouldn't say  it's a fun book, but I got some laughs out of it, especially the Fourth  Crusade, when the pilgrims skipped Jerusalem and pillaged Constantinople  instead.  Those crazy Crusaders.

For one,  Matthews seems determined to put Huck through hell in the course of this  very long novel.  I understand that he was trying to show how it's  sometimes hard to grow from a naive kid into a man, but he went a bit too  far...think over all the hardships Huck had to endure in this book.  And  every time he would overcome one, another would materialize instantly.  There are also more coincidences in this novel than your average sitcom.  Despite the fact that Huck is traveling through the entire Wild West, he  consistently meets and re-meets the same people over and over again, not to  mention the Detective who is after him, who must run off Duracel batteries.  My main problem with the book, though, is how bloodthirsty Matthews is.  By page 50 he's already killed off half the people you know and remember  from the Huck Finn books Twain wrote (Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer  Abroad, Tom Sawyer Detective).  And that's another thing, Matthews totally  ignored these final two books, sequels which Twain himself wrote and which  continue Huck and Tom's adventures.  As far as this novel of Matthew's is  concerned, those books never happened.  His portrayal of Tom Sawyer is off  as well; Tom changes into a girl-smitten tool within the first five pages,  and proceeds to ignore his best friend Huck.  And let's not mention how  much personal hell and torment Matthews puts Jim through.  Let's also not  mention that Matthews has to create plot devices by resurrecting characters  that Twain killed off - I'm talking about one character in particular whom  he has brought back, for no other reason than to add even more torment to  Huck's unbearable lot in life.  I tell you, the main thing this book left  me with was sadness for old Huck and Jim.  They deserved better.  And they  got it, at least in the books Twain himself wrote - Tom Sawyer Abroad and  Tom Sawyer, Detective, and also the unfinished stories which are collected  in Huck and Tom Among the Indians.  I would recommend them, unless you like  your Huck with a lot of angst.  Not me, though.  I'll save that for the  real world.er.

Apparently, they were both very popular back when they were first published, in the late 1890s, but have become  mostly forgotten.  They're more novellas than anything; Detective isn't  even 100 pages long.  The illustrations are really good, and I plan on  buying the other volumes in the Mark Twain Library, each of which include  the original illustrations that were present in the first editions.  Both  Abroad and Detective are entertaining, but they're not in the mold of the  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  You know how in Huckleberry Finn, Huck  goes through all these little misadventures, all the while growing up and  gaining all kinds of wisdom, and then in the end, the book takes a harsh  turn and goes back to the juvenile exploits of Tom Sawyer, when he and Huck  try to free Jim?  It's like the end of the book really doesn't have much to  do with the rest of it, it's just Huck and Tom doing dumb, yet funny, kid  stuff.  Well, both Abroad and Detective are like that; only very  occasionally do you get any of Huck's unique flashes of insight.  Jim  himself only appears in Abroad, which is a fantasy tale in which he, Tom,  and Huck happen to be kidnapped onto a high-tech balloon (!) and go across  the Atlantic to Africa.  There's really not much of a plot or resolution,  they just float along over the desert, Tom tells them about the Arabian  Nights, and Jim gets stranded on the head of the Sphinx for a little while.  Abroad picks up not long after the events in the Adventures of Huckleberry  Finn, and apparently Detective picks up not long after Abroad, though the  events that transpired in Abroad are never mentioned in Tom Sawyer,  Detective.  Maybe Twain considered Abroad more of a whimsical tale,  something that never really happened.  Who knows...but I think Detective  was the better of the two, even though Jim doesn't even appear in the book,  and it's more of a mystery novel than anything.  Huck basically plays the  role of the reporter in Detective, just relating all of the incidents he  witnessed in an unusual murder/crime, and describing Tom Sawyer's  scene-stealing exploits in the trial that follows.  Many of the characters  that appeared in the last half of Adv. of Huck Finn make a return  appearance in Detective.  But anyway, both books are enjoyable to read,  especially considering that both are written in the 1st person, from Huck's  perspective, yet don't read them expecting the depth and emotion that are  found in the Adv. of Huck Finn.  I think these books were written for a  younger audience, and that's how they read.  But, for a frustrating, yet  very interesting look into what might have been, had Twain finished his  other two planned sequels to Huckleberry Finn, you should check out the  book &quot;Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Among the Indians,&quot; which contains  two unfinished sequels that are both heads and tails better than Abroad and  Detective: Among the Indians and Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy.

Once you know this and watch the movie,  especially the Director's Cut, it becomes pretty obvious.  I mean, first of  all the guy gets beaten around unmerciful by just about every other  replicant in the movie, yet it doesn't really seem to faze him (except for  the broken fingers).  He pulls himself up a building using only one hand,  too.  Then of course there's his Unicorn dream, and at the end of the film  we see that Gaff has left a Unicorn origami for Deckard, clueing him in to  the fact that Deckard himself is a replicant. Gaff knows what Deckard  dreams about because he knows everything that's been implanted in Deckard's  head.  Of course, if this isn't enough to convince you then there's also  the fact that Ridley Scott, the director of the movie, has stated that it  was always his belief that Deckard was a replicant, he just never  implicitly stated that in the film.  My take on the end of the movie was  that Deckard was slowly realizing he was a replicant (hence his fascination  with playing and re-playing the interview Holden did with Leon) and then  once he saw that Gaff had left the Unicorn he decided to hell with it, and  went on the run with Sean Young's character, Rachel.  I was hoping Jeter's  book would follow this, maybe pick up right after the movie, answer some  questions that the movie didn't, but instead he's just done a re-hash of  the film's plot and merely given us a dry hump instead of the real thing.	1999-07-21

Oswald	There's a certain school of thought that states that authors generally don't make good scriptwriters; they're too much in love with words, not dialogue.  DeLillo falls into this category.  His sentences are beautifully written (though some times he seems to be trying too hard), but his characters don't talk TO each other, they talk AT each other.  Every person in the book seems to have some knack for speaking like wanna-be nineteenth century poets.  Anyway, the novel itself is enjoyable, but DeLillo tries to cover all the angles.  Oswald WAS a lone nut.  But, unbeknownst to him, the CIA was really pulling his strings, designing their very own &quot;patsy&quot; before the fact.  What?  Isn't this an either or situation?  Or maybe this is closer to the truth than DeLillo realizes; on November 22, 1963,  just about anything seemed to have been possible.	1997-10-03

I bought this book for fifty cents on a lark; don't waste your time looking for it.  I remember the hype that surrounded it ten years ago, and now, after another decade with no &quot;miraculous&quot; discovery of Elvis still being among the living, I thought it would be kind of funny to see what claims the author had made.  Instead, I found this book to be a thinly-veiled advertisement for the author's novel &quot;Orion.&quot;  She claims over and over again how this novel, which she wrote right after Presley's death, mirrored reality.  Apparently she found this strange, as she just swears she was never a fan of Elvis.  Anyway, this book of hers she keeps plugging shows some famous performer faking his own death to live a life of anonymity.  After a few people read the novel many approached Giorgio with their belief that she was writing about Elvis.  She claims she was unaware people believed Presley was still alive, and went ahead with trying to get the book publsihed, which it eventually was.  And, sure enough, there follows a conspiracy in which her book suddenly disapears from bookstore shelves across the nation (she hints Colonel Tom Parker might just have been behind it.)  Supposedly her novel got too close to the truth, or something like that.  The actual information pertaining to Elvis's death is slim compared to the detail Giorgio puts into talking up &quot;Orion.&quot;  Then of course there is the transcript, allegedley of a phone conversation between Elvis and some unknown person in 1981, but unfortunatley I don't have the tape (which  I remember was sold seperatley, thereby increasing the profit for all concerned.)  It's kind of funny to read for a laugh, but then after awhile even that wears thin.	1997-10-03
US	52938460	R1JF0LZR6I5UV1	0380703122	455954925	Whirlwind	Books	4	81	84	N	N	Out of familiar territory, Clavell still writes a great book	I bought Whirlwind at a used bookstore with a mixture of anticipation and regret.  Anticipation because Clavell always writes one hell of a good book.  Regret because, besides &quot;the Children's Story,&quot; this was the only Clavell book I hadn't read, and, due to his unfortunate death in 1993, I guess we won't be seeing anything new from him ever again (will anything be released posthumously?)  Instead of his normal Japanese or Chinese locales Clavell delves into Iran, circa 1979.  The Revolution is going on and it's looking bad for the European and American members of an Iran-based helicopter company, secretly owned by the Noble House of Hong Kong.  Clavell flawlessly combines the small struggles in life, like taboo, cross-cultural loves, business, life and death, with the religous zealously that swept across a nation and changed it dramatically.  All of his familiar plots and subplots are here, not as manifold as &quot;Noble House,&quot; but still the novel is much deeper and far-reaching than just about any other modern fiction.  And character?  Every one of Clavell's characters seem to be cut out of real-life, with their own dreams and desires and challenges.<br />  One last cool thing  is that certain characters from Noble House appear in this book, letting us see what's happened in their lives in the past seventeen years (Noble House takes place in 1962.)  My recommendation:  if you like Clavell, you'll like this, even though it all takes place in the Middle East, with no Asian locales.  If you can, read it in order, after Noble House, as chronologically this is the last of the Eastern Saga, even though &quot;Tai-Pan&quot; was written in 1993.	1997-10-03
