I was spellbound by RELIC and not particularly captivated by any since. <br />NOT ANY MORE as DANCE is as spellbinding as RELIC and achieves the enviable goal of a book you simply cannot put down until finished. <br />Pendergrast is haunted by his consumate evil brother Diogenes and the chase, if you will, is on. <br />Returning once again to the hallowed halls of the Museum of Natural History allows your imagination to run wild in those spooky and ancient halls/walls.  <br />The flow of words describing the frustration/horror/chase of the good guys vs. the bad guy is riviting. <br />We do not know what is going to happen next, our hero appears to have met his match, people are killed left and right, etc. etc. <br />If you look in the dictionary under \\"thriller\\" there needs to be a picture of \\"Dance of Death.\\" <br />The ending is outstanding and should not be discussed in a review. <br />Run, don't walk to your nearest bookstore and buy this book. You will NOT be disappointed.	2005-09-13

Haig is a keeper and so are his books. <br />Read the dust cover if you want a review and then buy it.	2005-09-04

Most authors today, I believe, are pressured by their publishers to crank out book after book after book. <br />Consequently, they often reach the point of writing for $$ rather than a productive story line. <br />Connelly seems to be beyond the hype and writes one good book after another. <br />Pick this up and enjoy.	2005-05-31

Coben is good but this is simply not up to some of his best in the past.<br /><br />You will be entertained with a tangled plot but perhaps I expect too much.<br /><br />Lots of surprises and a review of the plot would take multiple paragraphs.

Absolutely riviting & frightening. <br />There were many opportunities for the Germans to succeed and,fortunately, the American soldier and his British allies prevailed. <br />This book provided information that I had not read in the past.

Elvis is a \\"character\\" as is \\"Pike\\" and I found each previous book impossible to put down. <br />I did not care for Forgotten Man as we learned about his past (Elvis) and much relived via flashbacks. The story was a bit convoluted as an excuse to tell us about the Elvis as a child, etc. Don't need it. <br />Frankly, I do not care about the past of Elvis because I enjoy him as he is. Also felt this book did not give us the wisecracking gumshoe that is so much fun with Elvis and Pike. <br />I guess I don't think you need to flesh out something that is perfect to begin with. As they say, \\"if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.\\" <br />Elvis lives but not to my taste in this book. <br />Bring back more of what we have in the past. I would find it hard to recommend this one. <br />	2005-03-24

I methodically lined them up from the date of publication and each has been a treat. Elvis and Joe are the best. <br />And then I read Sunset Express. <br />ABSOLUTELY the best detective novel I have ever read. This book is more than good, it is a CLASSIC. <br />Publishers Weekly named it as a \\"Best book of the year.\\" No question about it. <br />The only \\"negative\\" is that you finish it. I am not going to keep my copy, I am going to circulate it to friends. <br />I don't want to discuss the plot, just go out and buy it and enjoy. <br />I can hardly wait to go to the book store and get the next one in this series.

They know how to make a buck BUT caveat emptor. <br />This is the second hunk of junk from Patterson after London Bridges. More of the same. <br />Miniscule plot, tired and repetitive theme done before. <br />A complete waste of time - won't bore you with capsule comments on the plot and characters. <br />The goal must be $$ rather than a book to treasure. <br />Buy something else - like Robert Crais Or Lawrence Block.	2005-02-24

The premise seemed OK but 90% of the text tells us infinitely MORE than we want or need about the characters. <br />Solution takes a minimal amount of effort. Anyone who reads this book ought to get a 37 hour lapel pin for putting up with it.

This was my first Crais novel and not, by any stretch, my last. <br />Finally, a detective series when the gumshoe doesn't spend his downtime at a AA meeting. <br />Elvis is real, bad, funny, and different. Joe Pike makes it even better. <br />If you enjoy a very readable mystery - this is the one. I have only read one but I have got to believe they only get better. <br />Super book.	2005-02-20

I enjoy reading about Jack and generally like all novels by Wilson. <br />This may sound nuts but I wish Repairman Jack did just that. He has methods and a mantra unlike any other good guy taking matters into his own hands to squash the bad guys. <br />But the supernatural aspects do not work for me with Jack. I dislike the far-fetched Other in this context. <br />Get the bad guys Jack and leave it at that. <br />Without reviewing past Jack novels this one \\"clearly\\" leaves us hanging and we know the serial shall continue. <br />Maybe in the next book Jack can vanquish the Other and lets move on to other (no pun intended) things.	2005-01-05

So reading and appreciating those sacrifices is paramount to me. <br />I found this book \\"disturbing\\" (in a good way) in that the book literally took the reader inside the walls of Stalag 17. <br />It was a fearful experience and filled me with dread and agony for those who lived through that experience. <br />Some of the material mirrows what the movie \\"Stalag 17\\" depicted but certainly not with the Hollywood context of stalag life. <br />Ned Handy is one of countless heros who served all of us. God bless them, each and every one. <br />This is a book to cherish and help us understand the horror of war and the sacrifices of so many. <br />	2005-01-05

The executive members of Enron and Arthur Andersen and V Elkins should all be under the jail. <br />They knew what they were doing and rationalized their decisions based on greed and ego. <br />If they were so smart, why could they not do the right thing? <br />This book should be required reading for any business major and perhaps a college course. <br />Read it and weep.

We bring back the WOLF and the WEASEL and perhaps these \\"rats\\" are a reflection of the text. <br />But an even bigger problem is what Mr. Patterson has done with the pages. A classic example of caveat emptor. <br />The book is 391 pages but then again, it is not. <br />FIRST, the font size is much larger so let's assume that reduces the text by 20 pages. <br />SECOND, the book has a Prologue and 5 Parts. Each one allows for blank pages that total 14 pages included in the total. <br />THIRD, we have 123 chapters, all of which start mid-page and end mid-page. That deducts another 123 pages from the book. <br />So we reduce the readable text from 391 pages to 234. And, guess what, the price did not shrink. <br />This book and the manner in which it is presented is a bummer. <br />Future books by Patterson, if I read them, will be on the library list so I may save my money for OTHER authors.	2004-11-18

Don't want to spoil the broth. <br />This is a good book and entertaining and I think you will enjoy. <br />My only complaint is that it mirrors others of the same genre. <br />But it is worth your time. <br />	2004-11-05

My mistake but not to be repeated. <br />The hype, in my opinion, comes from the premise of a \\"good guy\\" serial killer.

In any case, I have no desire to read about them. <br />This is sick stuff and I hated the book. Understand he is writing a sequel.
