Eremon is a nephew of Lleminawg (Lancelot) but becomes the pawn of Vortepor of Dyfed and is enlisted to find the holy \\"chalice.\\"<br /><br />I was finally rewarded after reading a third of the book when it became a genuine page turner.

They are both blessed/cursed with great magic.  William is also the reincarnation of King Arthur (which I found extremely difficult to swallow).  It follows William and Matilda from 1047-1066 in primarily Normandy & England.  The overall story was ok but it was not riveting.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this novel is the idea that William is actually King Arthur reincarnated.  I find it difficult to believe that \\"William/Arthur\\" would have been able to justify the slaughter of his own \\"countrymen\\" to rightfully rule again.<br /><br />I enjoyed Judith Tarr's \\"Pride of Kings\\" & \\"Kingdom of the Grail\\" much more.

This is a book about multiple medieval characters: King Ethelred, Earl Godwin of Wessex, Edward the Confessor, Canute, Harold Harefoot, Hardicanute, Emma of Normandy, Harold Godwinsson, Duke William (who eventually becomes King William I, the Conqueror, of England) and most of all of Cedric, friend of Harold I, King of England. The first part of the book is primarily about Aelgifu, daughter of King Ethelred, who in history was also called \\"the Unready.\\" Her first husband is the Earl of Northumberland and is murdered. She soon finds herself exiled to Normandy with a life she neither wanted nor expected. Still she plots to put a true heir of Ethelred on the English throne.<br /><br />Kings come and go in this novel but the most memorable is King Harold who had the shortest reign. Cedric who was originally one of his Harold's father's thegns of note becomes Harold's best friend and supporter. His loyalty to Harold and the life he could have had costs him dearly but he never doubts himself or Harold.<br /><br />The book encompasses a huge span of time, fifty-three years, and leaves no stone unturned and many questions are given logical historical answers. Even though the Norman culture is said to have given much to the English, one can't help but wonder what a different, less brutal England might have existed had King Harold I won the battle at Hastings in 1066. If he hadn't had to battle his brother Tostig, things might have been very different indeed. I too rooted for Harold even though I knew the bloody outcome.<br /><br />Read this book, it is an exceptional story of love, betrayal, loyalties divided & lost, kingdoms won & lost, but most of all the spirit of human persistence and hope prevails!	2005-07-08

I've read a few historical novels on the life of this enigmatic King, Alfred the Great. None have compared in the sheer depth of character study the author exhibits here of this great leader. We get to know Alfred through all the phases of his life, from childhood to manhood and eventually king. His life is showcased in a way that lets the reader experience his every emotion, adventure, battle, health crises through his eyes and through his brother's and eventually his wife's, Elswyth.<br /><br />He was a nobly born man, however, he was the fifth son and was never expected to be king, nor did he want to be. The twists and turns of his family's lives changes all of that. From his father's death, King Ethelwulf of Wessex, to all of his brother's deaths, including his favorite brother Ethelred, who bequeaths the throne over his eldest son to Alfred, his destiny, is forever changed. He is a leader who refuses to give up his dream of a free Wessex and rallies his countrymen to him to continue the fight against the Vikings. He does this with the help of his wife Elswyth, Princess of Mercia, who is a force of her own to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Together, they will endeavor to save their kingdom, their lives and their people's lives, from the pagan invasion the Danes constantly threaten them with. This is the king who worked so diligently to bring learning to his devasted land. Joan Wolf states in her Afterword: \\"The educational system of Anglo-Saxon England had been founded on the great monasteries, and these had been devasted by the Danes, leaving Wessex in a state of absolute poverty in regard to learning.\\"<br /><br />The only complaint I have regarding this book is the lack of a \\"regional map\\" at the time of Alfred the Great. I had to refer to another map from another book. I prefer to refer to a map, as I'm sure many other readers like to do, when locations are so important to the storyline in relation to battles, etc., that I really can't do without one. I believeit's integral to the story.  More authors need to realize that readers really do need these maps to follow the storyline.	2005-06-09

This is the compelling, never boring story of Ceawlin, illegitimate Prince of the King Cynric, of the West Saxons & Ceawlin's soon to be unlikely bride, Niniane, Princess of the Celts, a captive of his father's.<br /><br />It begins in the middle of the 6th century, in Wessex, England. Ceawlin is challenged to a duel by his younger legitimate brother, Edwin, who is in league with his mother to kill the popular prince. Prince Ceawlin wins the duel but at a great cost and he and Niniane must flee to escape the wrath of Guthfrid, the bitter and jealous Queen.<br /><br />The adventures of these two are the sweeping tales of well-loved and often told sagas (or should be). The plots and subplots abound and the desire to know what happens next to Ceawlin, Niniane and their friends and enemies is gripping. The differences between pagan and Christian are intricately described as are the differences in the Celts and the Saxons lifestyles.<br /><br />I've read the first in this \\"loose\\" trilogy, \\"The Road To Avalon.\\" This novel picks up 80 years after the death of King Arthur and continues with the story of Alfred the Great in \\"The Edge Of Light.\\" In fact I've just started on \\"The Edge of Light\\" and it looks to be a genuine page turner as the first two.

This is the story of Arthur, and his more than humble beginnings, until Merlin tells him years after he \\"adopted\\" him that he is the heir to the British throne after Uther.  He is Uther and Igraine's legitimate son.  While Merlin is preparing him to be a leader whilst living in Avalon with his daughter Morgan, the two children develop a lasting friendship that turns into love.  He doesn't know for years that Uther is his father, Igraine his mother, Merlin his grandfather and Morgan his aunt until he is to be king.  By then it is too late to stop the love between Morgan and Arthur.<br /><br />He becomes king but he still wants to marry Morgan.  Merlin & Morgan warn him that the threat of incest will impede his reign and tell him it's impossible to marry her. He does eventually marry Gwenhwyfar in a loveless marriage to produce an heir while continuing his relationship with Morgan.  Meanwhile, Gwenhwyfar finds comfort with Bedwyr with Arthur's knowledge and unspoken permission.  Morgan has been keeping a secret from Arthur for 15 years that also comes out.<br /><br />Read this book!  It's a refreshing storyline that I haven't encountered before.  Bedwyr is Gwenhwyfar's lover and there is no Lancelot to fuddle things up as usual.  Mordred is portrayed as a very unwordly teen and unsure of himself and others.  Agravaine is as obnoxious and cunning as he usually is in other novels.  Gwenhwyfar is in love with two men. Finally, the relationship between Arthur and Morgan is not a simple one but a lasting one.	2005-05-09

The fourth installment in this series sees Justin de Quincy's adventures as the \\"Queen's man\\" continue.  I found the first part of this story hard to delve into, probably because of the large gaps between books in this series.  However, once past some of the more unfamiliar names and events the story began to come alive again.  Justin is enlisted to help Prince John prove that a letter implicating him in a plot to assassinate his brother King Richard is a forgery.  He unwillingly teams up with the man who originally tried to murder him at John's command, Durand.  Plots and subplots abound in this story and Justin is also pressed upon to find the murderer of a lady, whom he grew to like and who was also an ally (spy & lover) of Prince John's.<br /><br />Surprises are found around nearly every corner, mysterious characters are revealed and the plot thickens. Constance the Duchess of Brittany (widow of Geoffrey, John & Richard's brother) is believed to be at the center of the plot against Prince John.  She wishes to see her own son, Arthur, John's nephew on the throne instead of another Angevin.<br /><br />This mystery was a veritable page turner and ended much too soon for me!  Alas, we will just have to wait to see what Justin is up to next as we await the next book in this series. Read this series, in order (The Queen's Man: A Medieval Mystery, Cruel as the Grave and Dragon's Lair), as any one of them are really not a \\"stand alone\\" novel and are deeply entwined with one another.	2005-04-24

A thoroughly interesting read that should have been a much shorter read.  Although the subject matter here is about the legendary Hound of Culain (Cuculain), the incredible story of this Irish hero would have been a much better and/or more readable one, if it hadn't been such a lengthy one.  At times the story dragged but overall was a very good read!<br /><br />This is the story of Culain (Cuculain), Ireland's & Ulster's greatest hero descended from the Sidhe, Meave, Queen of Connacht, Fergus Macrogh an Exiled Chieftain from Ulster, and Calatin the Queen's evil Druid advisor.  It is also a story of all those who were caught in the crossfire between these strong personalities, personally and eventually mortally.<br /><br />It is definitely worth the read, all of Kenneth C. Flint's (also known as K. C. Flynn/Casey Flynn).  This was not the most exciting of all his books I've read to date but I was intrigued by a different perspective of Cuculain and was overall satisfied with this work.

Martin and Richard have known each other as children and their friendship picks up where it left off and they become the best of friends. They grow up and face nearly every life adventure together. Martin's viewpoint during the novel is witty, insightful and at times humorous. He follows Richard through nearly every aspect of his life including his ascent to the throne of England. Theirs was not an easy life even though Martin is privy to the royal lifestyle.<br /><br />The author also discusses what could probably, if not possibly, have happened to the Princes in the Tower. Her theory on this makes a great deal of sense that I found very believable. This was an incredible page turner and I was up late many nights, into the wee hours of the morning, devouring every page.

I must be honest my first impression of this book wasn't the best.  I read a few pages into it when I encountered the phrase \\"unridered stallion\\" in a paragraph.  I thought to myself, if this novel is full of more \\"different\\" phrases/words such as \\"unridered\\" I'm going to have a real problem finishing it.  I'm happy to report that there were no more occurrences of these types of words (I don't even think that \\"unridered\\" is a genuine word) and I sailed through the rest of the book.<br /><br />It takes place in the later part of the 12th century in Wales.  The in-depth characters will have you hooked in no time!  The Welsh King of Maelienydd, also called Noble (King Maelgwyn ap Cadwallon) marries Isabel Mortimer, niece to Roger Mortimer, a ruthless Marcher Baron in England.  He hopes to quell Roger's constant forays into his kingdom to conquer more Welsh land.  Things do not turn out that way, and to add more woes to his kingdom and his court, his friend and fool Gwirion is constantly at odds with his Queen, Isabel.<br /><br />When Noble goes off to fight a battle with Roger he leaves Isabel and Gwirion behind at his castle.  Things take a decidedly bizarre twist between Isabel and Gwirion when their castle is taken by a rival prince's band of men, and they are held prisoner together in a small room.  From then on I was really captivated into reading more about these complex characters.  Noble eventually returns to his home after being notified that his castle is under siege by an \\"enemy\\" force.  He knows something is different between Gwirion and Isabel but he isn't sure what.<br /><br />The ending in this book is so shocking and unbelievable that you'll just have to read this novel for yourself!

However, that being said, one can only read and reread Ms. Llywelyn's books so many times before they begin to hunger for a different perspective.  This book adeptly delivers that!  Although, the beginning of the novel moves rather slowly it quickly gains momentum in the character conflicts of Sentanta & Cormac, Queen Meave & King Conchobar, the druids Cathbad & Calatin and many more.<br /><br />Ancient Ireland itself is a mystical, magical place and its inhabitants are no less interesting in this book.  It actually was a spellbinding tale I had a hard time putting down many nights!  I've read everything I can find in this genre of historical fiction/fantasy and this is one of the best I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Authors that write any type of fiction must learn to draw their readers in and hold them there for the entire duration of the novel and Kenneth Flint has managed to do this very skillfully.

Uhtred, the son of an Earl becomes an orphan at ten and is captured and adopted by Ragnar the Dane. He is taught the Viking ways and Ragnar becomes more a father to him than his own father ever was. He loves the unrestricted, impious ways of the Danes and learns to become a formidable warrior.<br /><br />King Alfred, (later known as \\"The Great\\") is portrayed as an over pious but clever King of Essex. While Alfred is not a well-liked King, he is an intelligent one and soon comes to bind Uhtred to his cause against the Danes.<br /><br />The brutally descriptive battle scenes are exciting and repellant at the same time. Battles and wars are not described here as glorious and heroic circumstances but as what they really were, brutal, bloody, and often times fatal.<br /><br />This title was an excellent read and I just couldn't put it down many times at night. I've read it until the wee hours of the morning. I believe this is the best BC title I have ever read to date, even though I haven't read any of the Sharpe's novels (that era and place settings are not of interest to me).

That aside, let's get on with the review.<br />This is the story of Clothar the Frank, who will later on be known as Lancelot.  He was raised as the son of King Ban of Benwick in Gaul, the land of the Franks.  He discovers at the age of ten that his parents were actually murdered by a usurper soon after his birth.  However, he has all the talent of a skilled warrior and leader, who will eventually avenge his parent's deaths.  In the meantime, he is caught in a war between his cousins, formerly his older brothers, for the crown of Benwick.<br />Before this, and shortly after he finds out his true parentage, he is sent with Bishop Germanus to attend his school.  Here he learns to become a warrior as well as become a more introspective individual.  Germanus eventually sends him on a mission to Britain bearing messages for Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Bishop  Enos.  Little does he know that his destiny will lie in this alien country and with the new Riothamus, Arthur Pendragon &amp; Gwinnifer.<br />It's been quite a while since I've read the other books in this series, but for me, Clothar the Frank, was a well-written, page-turning novel that kept me engrossed for many nights, some into the a.m.!  I believe that this is perhaps Jack Whyte's best effort yet, and I am hoping the publication of the next book in THE GOLDEN EAGLE series is in the very near, not distant, future!	2004-07-21

But following the disgrace of Harry Percy and the death of his son Hotspur, they were stripped of their power, which fell to the Nevilles, deadly rivals and mortal enemies of the whole Percy clan.  When a dynastic marriage-to a Neville-brought Hal Percy back from exile, the whole brutal saraband was to start again:  Percy at the throat of Neville whether campaigning with Henry V, or skirmishing round the throne held so tenuously by Henry VI.  In an age when calculated brutality and a talent for intrigue were the basic building blocks of survival, the savagery of the Percy/Neville contest was a by-word.&quot;<br />This is the second book in this trilogy and proves itself to be as exciting and fast-paced as the first!	2004-07-04

While I love reading historical fiction the beginning had me somewhat taken aback by all of the characters (and their titles) thrown at me.  I've read quite a bit in this genre and even I was confused and can only imagine the trouble first time readers of this era had with it.  Also, aside from the occasional typographical error (usually text that was missing, I was determined to stick with it and I'm not sorry it did!<br />This is an exciting tale of Constance of York who is married to Thomas Despenser.  She is involved in many plots to overthrow the new king, Henry Bolinbroke, who has usurped the crown from King Richard II.  Constance is a relative of both kings, however, she prefers Richard over Henry as many other nobles and commoners do.  Her brother, Edward, who eventally becomes the Duke of York, is a very shady character who cannot even remain loyal to his sister in the best of circumstances.  The intrigues are endless and exciting!  After the initial shock of the magnitude of the cast of characters was untangled the story quickly became a page turner!<br />Constance is a character that the reader cares about, what she thinks, feels and does in any given circumstance.  From the men in her life, Thomas Despenser, Edmund Mortimer, and Edmund Holland she stives to retain her independence in an age where this sort of thing just wasn't done by ladies.  And, the amount of research that went into this novel is impressive!	2004-05-04

Her father has promised her to an evil sorcerer, Euberacon, when she is of age.  This was the pact made between these two to save the life of Risa's mother, who was dying at the time.<br />As Risa is growing up she suspects something is wrong as her father refuses all of her suitors for marriage.  When she finally finds out the truth she decides to run away and live elsewhere, anywhere but with Euberacon.  On the way, she is saved by Sir Gawain of Camelot who vows to protect her with his life and bring her plight before King Arthur and Queen Guinevere. He also needs to inform them of the plot against them to take over Camelot by Euberacon and his minions.<br />However, many adventures and nightmares await both of them along the way.  The plot moves quickly and is a genuine page turner from start to finish.  I've read probably every type of Arthurian fiction available and this novel was a true winner, in every sense!  I can hardly wait until her next novel in this series is published in 2005!	2004-04-20

He never fails to keep me enthralled.  This time the tale is about a Norman family, in particular, Gerlaine, that strives to bridge the gap between Norman and Saxon.  Gurth, the Saxon who catches Gerlaine's eye, is forbidden to touch her by her father.  However, love finds a way, and not without tragic consequences to be paid by both lovers.<br />The plot had many twists and turns and towards the end the book and a few surprises are revealed that even I didn't see coming.  The story tells what may have happened between many Saxons and Normans and their startling cultural differences that cannot help but play a major part in their lives.<br />Read this novel!  If you haven't read anything by Parke Godwin you're really missing out on a major storytelling talent.  All of his books are as good as this one including: Lord of Sunset, The Last Rainbow, Sherwood, Firelord, The Tower of Beowulf, Robin and the King, and Beloved Exile, just to name a few.  Three of these are a trilogy and should be read in order, just check on Amazon.com to discover the correct order in which to read them in.	2004-03-28

It would seem the story of Tristan and Essylte would be a much told, tired story by now.  However, this author puts some new twists on the old legend and breathes life into its characters.  The fates are against these two lovers from the beginning but they try to make a valiant showing throughout the book.  Essylte's maidservant, Branwen, is not what she seems and she brings about many of the circumstances Essylte and Tristan endure.  King Markion, who is now high king of Britain is Tristan's uncle and wishes to wed the Welsh Princess to bring unity to Britain.  Unfortunately, his scope is very limited and Tristan and many others only support him because there is no one better to do so.  Except for Tristan, of course, however, he does not desire the high kingship, only Essylte, someone he is never destined to have.<br />It is a wild ride with much intrigue and many interesting twists that will keep the reader enthralled from beginning to end.

He engages Daracha, a practitioner of the \\"dark arts\\" to help him achieve his goal.<br />This time Marcus and Claerwen are trying to prevent the asassination of the new high king, Uther.  Along the way, things go wrong and they are falsely delcared fugitives by the people they seek to protect. They begin to trust no one but themselves but are alternatively captured, rescued and escape with great drama.  Considering how many times they need to spy on their enemies, the ratio of them being captured is still very low. The ever prevalent risk of being discovered spying is what enhances the exciting action and makes this book a real page turner!<br />This is an incredible novel, and just as riveting as the first in this four-book series.  These books are not to be missed! Try it from the beginning with \\"Into the Path of Gods\\" and you'll be hooked!

This is a sweeping epic of a story that will span four books in the series of the turbulent and exciting years before King Arthur's reign.  The scope of this story and the way the author keeps you guessing from moment to moment, in suspense, to read the next passage is \\"magically\\" amazing.  I was not prepared for such a wild ride!<br />This is the story of Marcus ap Iowerth, Welsh spy and \\"master of disguise\\" and Clarwen, a woman touched by the \\"sight\\" or \\"fire in the head,\\" as precognition is known.  Their adventures are never ending and leave the reader breathless, craving more and more!  The plot centers on Macsen's Treasure, which is composed of a crown, torque, sword, spearhead, and grail.  Whoever has any or all of these in their possession can claim the high kingship of Britain as they carry a sacred history. Also, in this novel we are introduced to Myrddin (Merlin), Aurelius Ambrosius, Myrddin's father and High King and the mysterious loner warrior named, \\"The Iron Hawk.\\"<br />Read this book, otherwise you'll be missing out on a major talent: the author, Kathleen Cunningham Guler!

These questions and more are entertainingly answered with many surprises.<br />I bought this book knowing it was for young adults, which I definitely am not, hoping for an alternative and entertaining story that was fresh.  I didn't think it could be done (I've read hundreds of Arthurian Literature books) and certainly didn't expect the surprise this book turned out to be!

Original Review Submission: 12/21/2003<br /><br />Even though this is a story about Elizabeth I and Grace O'Malley, the Irish Pirate, it seems to center more on the Queen's current favorite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex and her relationship with him.  I thought this would be a novel about Grace and Elizabeth when they were in their younger years but it is not.  It is mostly a tale of Grace recounting her life for Elizabeth's own duplicitous agenda.<br /><br />While this was a good read, it was not what I expected.  The constant struggles between Essex and Elizabeth for power, love and respect were tiresome.  Elizabeth was clearly \\"losing it\\" in her later years as she dealt with her advancing age, loss of sexuality and mortality.  It somehow detracts from her earlier glorious reign.<br /><br />If you want to read an excellent novel about Grace O'Malley in her younger years including all of the excitement and daring she must have experienced in her life read: \\"GRANIA: SHE-KING OF THE IRISH SEAS\\" by Morgan Llywelyn.  I read this novel several years ago, before the recent re-issue of it and the incredible story has still remained with me!	2003-12-21

This is the story of Lin, slave of Queen Morgause, in Dunn na Carraice in the Orkney Islands.  She is a proud girl determined not to bow to the slavemasters and Modred who takes special delight in tormenting her in horrible ways.  The realism is very stark and brutal, but there are also moments of gentlenss and tenderness from her &quot;brother&quot; Dafydd in their daily, drab, overworked lives.  Is she really just Dafydd's younger, brave sister?  Or is she something more that no one could ever have imagined?  Some of Lin's strengths are also her weaknesses, but her indominable spirit eventually triumphs for both her and Dafydd.<br />This was an extraordinary read!  I can't recommend it highly enough!  The stark reality of slave life is portrayed heartbreakingly but also with dignity and compassion.  Lin's determination to not lose her humanity or soul to those in power over her is incredibly amazing and admirable.

Treachery abounds with King Mark, his nephew and Tristan's cousin Andred, and finally with Blanche, another Isolde, Princess of France.<br />The story plods on with Tristan and Isolde losing each other, and finding each other again and again.  It is an okay read but the tale is not told with much passion or intensity.  The mushy prose expressed by Tristan and Isolde, of their inner thoughts, is at times somewhat nauseating.<br />I've read all of Rosalind Miles novels and this is by far the worst one to date.  It's passable read if you have no other book to occupy your time.  It is not in the same class of novels as Mile's novel &quot;I, Elizabeth.&quot;  This was a novel that surpassed all my expectations of a captivating, all encompassing novel.	2003-11-02

Now Henry V must keep what his father had won.<br />So Henry turned to his brothers for support and Humfrey of Gloucester gave it unstintingly, though he later tried to wild power during the minority of his nephew, Henry VI.  There was also another side to Humfrey's character.  As a genuine scholar he loved books in an age when learning was for cloistermen, not courtiers.<br />However, Humfrey inherited not only the Plantagenet charm and energy, but also their talent for strirring up trouble.  He quarrelled bitterly with the more prudent memebers of the family over his marriages and love affairs, for Humfrey's wild passions always attracted women.<br />Soldier, scholar and lover, Duke Humfrey embodied the best and the worst qualities of the Plantagenet dynasty.

This one concerns the person of King Edward II of England.  A not so popular king which probably accounts for my less than enthusiastic review.  It chronicles Edward II's passion for Piers Gaveston which roused his barons against him.  The de Montacute family continues to play a major role in this book as it did in the second novel in this series.  William de Montacute shared hatred for Roger Mortimer with the King and together they sought his downfall and a resurgence of the royal Plantagenet line<br />This was perhaps the slowest moving novel of this series so far, but I believe it is important to include it in the reading all of the books in the series as it gives a somewhat more favorable impression of Edward II as compared with other author's perspectives I've read.  He is portrayed as being  naive (to what extent I'm not sure) but also weak and frivolous in catering to his friends at the exclusion of some of the most powerful lords of the land.<br />It is an out-of-print book that I found easily available.<br />This review is from the hardcover edition of this book.	2003-10-02

The first is &quot;A Pride of Kings.&quot;  This novel concerns the beautiful and temperamental Princess Eleanor, who is born the year before her father, King John, died.  She remembers no other King than her Brother Henry III.  She was pampered all of her childhood and grew up very conscience of being a Plantagenet Princess.  Tragedy strikes her first marriage and she is shattered and only gradually does she eventually fall in love with a man who had his own place in history, Simon de Montfort.<br />He is the younger son of a Norman family who rose to a position of power in England.  His friendship with the story King changes to bitter hatred.  Simon becomes the champion of all those who wanted a curb set on the King's power, from the lowest peasant to the some of the highest lords of the land.  He was also he who called a great gathering to 'parley' - the first beginnings of Parliment.  Eventually, he grew too powerful in his own right and came to blows with both Henry III and his son Edward I, who was also known as &quot;Longshanks&quot; and &quot;The Hammer of the Scots.&quot;<br />This books covers most of the 13th century.  It's unfortunate that Simon and Edward I became such staunch enemies as they were once very good frieds and, after all, Simon was his uncle by marriage.  Eleanor stays true to her husband and his beliefs and stands against even her brother and nephew.<br />Another out-of-print novel that is well worth searching for and reading!	2003-09-29

Robert King's Arthurian trilogy.  Moran le Fey is showcased in this novel.  And what a novel it is!  We follow Morgan from her innocent childhood, cut short by Uther Pendragon's lust for her mother Igraine, to her obsession with the goddess Gaga whom she is determined to bring back to life in Britain.<br />Arthur, unfortunately, is her sworn enemy, even though he never realizes it, of all she reveres.  Arthur is the embodiment of destruction for Britain because he will be a bringer of constant war.  Morgan wants to bring back the old ways of Gaea and therefore beauty and peace to the land and its people.  She also intends to empower women and give them something they aren't familiar with, power and control over the men in their lives.<br />A wild exciting ride through Morgan's visions of what Britain and eventually the world should be is riveting and imaginative.  This book is fairly reminiscent of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; by the late Marion Zimmer Bradley.  This story contains much more edge of your seat reading with immense magic, the visions of Morgan and her quest to destroy Camelot before it destroys Britain and the world.<br />All three novels in this trilogy stand alone, however, read them all to experience the wonder that is author, J. Robert King!	2003-09-19

This is the continuing tale of Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot also known as Black Leg (who is also a wolf-shapeshifter).  In this second of Alice Borchardt's Guinevere series, Guinevere strives to save her people from the Saxons raiders at any cost.  She calls upon the spirit of the dead to aid her in her quest and takes on the fearful pirates on their own home turf.  She also has her own nifty set of weapons, self-protecting armor, and the ability to call upon fire to help destroy her enemies.<br />Meanwhile, Arthur and Lancelot are on quests of their own.  Arthur battles minions from King Bade and Lancelot learns much from The Lady of the Lake.  Merlin, Igrane and Uther also have their own ordeals showcased briefly.  The story switches around to each main character's individual adventures, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more.  The detailed descriptions of flora, fauna and everything else in the story was incredible and staggers the imagination.<br />I was sad to see this novel end as it was at an exciting and pivotal part in the plot.  Be sure to read The Dragon Queen first to get a firmer understanding of this latest novel.  Excellent Arthurian fantasy! Very much looking forward to the next in this series/trilogy!	2003-09-03

His love and later Queen, Anne Warwick is portrayed here as a strong female individual, not the simpering, scared woman who appears in other novels.<br />The cast of characters includes:  Edward IV, King and brother to Richard, Warwick (the Kingmaker) himself constantly making a bid for power, George Duke of Clarence, also brother to Richard, who plans to take the crown for himself, Louis XI, the Spider King and a surprising appearance of Thomas Mallory, author of Le Mort d' Arthur, who plays an integral part in the plot, plus many others.<br />This tale also showcases how Richard III, in the face of constant treachery, remains loyal to crown and country.  It also depicts what life may have been like for those living and dying in the turmoil of medieval England, and how the Plantagenets paved the way, for good or bad, for the Tudor Dynasty.	2003-08-09

I'm not even sure that one existed until Andre Norton wrote this one.  It's a mixture of historical fiction and science fiction that puts a unique face on Arthurian literature.  I was sceptical about reading this novel when I first picked it up.  However, I was hooked from the first page on.  It's written with such a different perspective that it grabs your attention and keeps it right through to the end.  In fact, I wish she would have continued this book in a trilogy or even a series.  It's that good!<br />In this story of Merlin, Nimue and Arthur, their characters are given an extra dimension.  Merlin and Arthur are half human, half alien (of the light-good), and Nimue is of the half human and alien of the dark forces.  Their struggles of good vs. evil are captivating and exciting.  Kept me turning page after page.<br />Pick up this novel and read it.  You will not be sorry you did, even if you are a fan of traditional Arthurian historical fiction.  This title is out-of-print but I found it quite by chance at a yearly library book sale.	2003-08-09

I thought it would be primarily about Richard III, however, it seems to be more about the historical fictional characters that are supposed to be telling his story.  They talk about thier own experiences much more than we hear about Richard's.  Very sad, as this could have been an excellent novel about him.  The fictional characters POVs touch very little on Richard but when they do they are very insightful and at times touching.  The day-to-day living descriptions of England are very realistic and not always rendered as fairy-tale like conditions even for the nobility.<br />If you want to read excellent historical fiction about Richard III try Sharon Kay Penman's &quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot;, &quot;Treason&quot; by Meredith Whitford, or even &quot;Desire The Kingdom&quot; by Paula Simonds Zabka.  Any of those novels far surpasses the content and readability of &quot;We Speak No Treason.&quot;<br /><br />I do have a soul when it comes to reading historical fiction, just much better taste.  If you really want to struggle through 576 pages, find it at the library and read it.	2003-08-09

This is the third book I have bought authored by Elizabeth Chadwick and even though I had to order it from the Great U.K., and wait well over two weeks for it, it was well worth the wait!<br />This story begins with the relationship of Waltheof of Huntingdon and Judith, niece of William the Conqueror. It also details the complex friendship Waltheof nutured and strained with Simon de Senlis, originally King William's squire and royal messenger. Things do not go well for Waltheof, who is easily led by rebels that happen to be his friends and he is eventally executed at the King's command.<br />Meanwhile, Waltheof's daughter Matilda and her mother Judith continue to run his estates in England. However, all that is about to change as Simon is commanded by the new King, William Rufus, to take over the control of his estates much to the chagrin and disgust of Judith and much to the delight of Matilda, her daughter.<br />The story is epic, sweeping through the countries of Normandy, England, and the Holy Land. Matilda and Simon have a stormy but eventually loving relationship that has weathered the worst of storms. Read this latest Elizabeth Chadwick novel if you crave excellent historical fiction!

In the beginning, Galahad, poisoned in mind against Lancelot, learns to hate his father.  His mother Elaine, with the help from a \\"priest\\" Aidan, work together successfully to turn Galahad against him.  While Elaine has her own reasons, some of them her own fault, for hating Lancelot, she enlists Aidan in her plans to shame him, not knowing that he has his own reasons for revenge.<br /><br />From all of this, Galahd has learned to despise his father and desires to avenge himself on Lancelot for the perceived cruelness imposed on his mother over the years.  He finally breaks free to go to Camelot to serve Arthur, the High King, but peace eludes him there also.  Eventually, he learns that all he was taught by his mother and Aidan was false and he then turns his mind against women, judging them all to be liars and the weaker of the sexes.  He also continues to hate his father but after awhile of gradual maturing he comes to understand Lancelot but finds it difficult to forgive him until he himself commits the same mistakes as his father did.<br />He goes on a quest for Arthur to find the treasures that will heal Britain and once again make her invincible to invaders.  For awhile, he travels with his cousin Percival who worships him as a hero figure.  Galahad's pompous, aloof behavior changes when he meets Dane, the twin sister of Percival.<br />Things then begin to change his preconceived ideas and he learns to eventually love and to quest for something more tangible and earthly to bring him peace of mind. The novel switches back and forth between Galahad's past and his present life and shows how he matures in mind and body over the years.<br />This is a real page turning yarn that will delight and enthrall any follower of Arthurian Literature.  I thought this would be a boring saga of the saintly character Galahad, but was pleasantly surprised to find it anything but.  Galahad is portrayed as a man struggling with what hehas always been taught to believe is right and what the true reality really is.  A totally believable human being  is showcased here with faults of his own that he must learn to conquer in order to find true happiness.  Read it, you will not be disappointed!	2003-06-29

The story takes place in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.  The story is told by several narratives of main characters in the novel such as:  Geoffrey Chaucer, Lady Hanmer of Flintshire-later his wife, Griffith Lloyd-Owen's bard among other characters.  Owen is the last Welsh Prince of Wales with a personality and physical presence that is striking for a man, from what was considered a wild and subject courntry of England.<br />He struggles with his desire for peace while at the same time he wages war on England to recognize Wale's independence.  A complex, exciting story of a man who would be king of Wales, but really didn't want to.<br />This is an out-of-print books, however I found a copy easily enough, and is well worth the effort and time to read.  Like all of Rofheart's books they are narratives of several characters, some historical, others fictional.	2003-06-06

Focusing primarily on her younger years before and directly after becoming a queen.  There is much detail to be found about early Celtic life and their customs.  While some parts are very interesting the author seemed to rush through some of the more important historical battles and results.<br />If this was indeed a first effort by the author, it is good.  However, with time and experience he could produce a higher calibre novel.  If you are interested in Queen Boudicaa this is a worthwhile read but by no means the best on this topic.

Each person, who, by the way really existed (with the exception of Blondelza and other minor characters), has their own chapter or book in which they give their personal view of Richard and his life and how these events affected both of them.<br />The horrible, gruesome battles and seiges of the Crusade are well defined here.  Almost too much so, however, it gives a more realistic picture of what both sides suffered in the name of God.  Richard is portrayed here as a complex prince and ruler who tries to do the right thing but being human sometimes fails in that endeavor.<br />It is a very worthwhile read and there are many interesting viewpoints from the most common of people, traveling entertainers to the Queen of England, Eleanor.  Each offers unique insights as to what life must have been like in medieval times.  This novel is out-of-print but should be found, read and treasured.	2003-04-06

Well, Arthur doesn't recover and eleven years later Bedwyr returns from fighting for Rome to right the wrong he committed.  However, one thing leads to another and he finds himself being asked by Irion, Arthur's grandson to help fight against the Saxons.  Irion is the son of Medraut, but is in no way like him.  He resembles Arthur in both appearance and personality.  Bedwyr refuses, saying that Britain's troubles are no longer his and continues to search for Excalibur.  As Bedwyr continues on his quest to find Excalibur Irion tries to find a way for the Britains to reclaim Britain and Camelot.  Will their two paths cross again?<br />The story is exciting and never lets up.  The ending is climatic and engaging!  It's just too bad it's only 209 pages long.  I was sad to see it end!  This was an excellent novel and didn't find any discrepancies concerning history because this was more an alternate historical fantasy novel and leaves the author much license to do with his story as he pleases.

Pay no attention to Kirkus Review.  It almost sounds as if they read an entirely different novel.<br />This is the story of Judith and Guyon of Ravenstow & Ledworth.  She was given into marriage with Guyon before even meeting him.  Her image of marriage is not a pretty one.  She imagines it to be like her mother's, full of violence.  Her \\"father\\" is half-brother to the infamous Lord Robert de Belleme.  Judith, for several months to a year is filled with distrust for her new husband, Guy, even though he has yet to exercise his \\"full martial rights.\\"  As time goes on, however, she learns to trust him in nearly everything.<br />However, there is a secret that even she does not suspect about herself, but others, including Guy, do.  In addition, Guy suffers a personal tragedy and surprisingly Judith, is empathetic about it.<br />The characters in this novel are complex, compassionate, realistic human beings.  The story is fast-paced and never dull.  The details of what life must have been like during William Rufus' and Henry I's reign are wild, sometimes brutal, but always interesting.  If you want to read a medieval book that does not disappoint, then this one is for you.  Beware, however, the modicum of sex that does appear in this title is neither gratitious nor vulgar, it is appropriate to the storyline.  It is out-of-print, but it can and should be found and read!  Also, be sure to read the rest in this trilogy, \\"The Running Vixen,\\" and \\"The Leopard Unleashed.\\" \\"King of the Wood\\" is also an excellent novel by Valerie Anand that uses William Rufus' reign as a backdrop.	2003-01-02

This sweeping saga of Great Britain, known then, as the ancient Albion, chronicles the lives of several outstanding defenders of freedom.  First is Caradoc, the son of a Celtic king, who tries to unite the people of his country against the invasions of Rome.  It is also about his sister Gladys who stays behind to fight the Romans while her brother escapes to fight them again.  She falls in love with a Roman despite her strong Celtic ties.  Finally, it is about Boudicca, (everyone spells it differently) and her devotion to carry on the work of Caradoc.<br />This book was one of the best I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down at times (even though I had to force myself to so I could go to sleep at night).  You are brought back into time and feel as though you are with these people, silently watching and cheering on the Celts, while at the same time cursing the Romans and their greedy grasping ways.  It is a long book but it doesn't seem so as the pages fly through your fingers as you become enveloped in the Celt's cause against Rome.  The book is wonderfully detailed with ancient pre-medievalism descriptions of people, places, etc.  You just have to buy this book, and read it, to believe how incredible it really is.  The characters are so three dimensional and emotional that you feel their pain and their triumphs with unbelievable passion.<br />Yes, this book is out-of-print, but if you find it, buy it, and read it and treasure it for years to come.  You will not be sorry that you turned the first page of the first chapter.<br />If you enjoyed this book I think you would also enjoy &quot;Warrior Queen&quot; by James Sinclair (also out-of-print but an excellent read), and &quot;Ashes of Britannia&quot; Warrior Queen Series by Haley Elizabeth Garwood.  These titles delve deeper into Boudicca's  fight against Rome.	2002-12-28

This rendition is about the small kingdoms of Britain being harassed by its various enemies, Picts, Irish Pirates, and Saxons.  Rome has long since left, however, Artorius remains as a brutal Roman general trying to protect Britain from her enemies.<br />A surprising twist to the story is Gwendaello (Guenevere), who instead of remaining in the background is a ruler in her own right, and is the successor to the Pendragon title not Artorius.  Merlin (Merddin) plays but a small role in this tale and I would have liked to have seen more from his character.<br />The bottom line is that Artorius tries to convince all of the small kingdoms to band together to fight the invaders.  He makes a strong case for it, because if they don't and continue to squabble among themselves there will be no Britain left to squabble over.<br />There wasn't nearly enough action in this book considering all of the battles \\"Arthur\\" actually fought, which was disappointing.  However, what was more disappointing was the verbosity in the book.  Descriptions of ordinary things was way overdone and/or done in a most tiring manner.  This story could have been very good if the author had fleshed out the characters more and treated them more as human beings than characters in a stale play.

I did not much enjoy the &quot;Middle East&quot; travel descriptions as I wanted to read only about the Norman Conquest.<br />If you like pure historical fiction not cluttered with obscure references to things otherwise boring-DO NOT READ THIS NOVEL.  There are many other novels about this era in history that are more well written and engaging!  Harold the King by Helen Hollick, Gildenford, The Norman Pretender &amp; The Disputed Crown by Valerie Anand, and The Conquest by Elizabeth Chadwick are much better reads to name just a few.	2002-12-03

The first being, Of The Ring Of Earls, the second, Henry Of The High Rock.  I thought this third book would be about the continuation of Henry I's reign.  It isn't, it is about Brien Fitzcount, Lord of Wallingford, and loyal supporter of the Empress Maud (Matilda) who as we all know battles her cousin Stephen, who betrays her and seizes her crown after pledging himself to be a loyal vassal to her.<br />Much of the story between Maud and Stephen we have read in detail already.  Here Dymoke makes Brien Fitzcount the main character in this book and all the others background characters.  At times the story was very intriquing, but in my opinion there weren't enough intriquing times, and the story became rather wordy and frequently lost my attention.<br />This was perhaps because I was expecting something else, but her other two books, mentioned previously in this review were outstanding historical reads and well worth the time to find as they, as well as this title, are all out-of-print.  However, Juliet Dymoke, even when not at her very best, is still superior to many historical authors at their best.	2002-11-06

This is the story of William of Normandy's, now King of England's, struggle to be recognized as England's sovereign lord.  He doesn't succeed very easily and sometimes overreacts in his choices of punishment that affect the common people more than the rebels.  He is not a very easy person to understand and like, however, he constantly tries, to either win his English nobles over with force or with uncharacteristic compasssion and understanding.<br />Meanwhile, Brand of Fallowdene and his daughter Wulfhild struggle in their own ways to come to terms with a Norman England.  Wulfhild decides to compromise to keep her family's English manor Fallowdene, while Brand, having made oathes to continue the fight against the Normans, joins the rebels in the attempt to put an Englishman back onto the throne of England.<br />This is an excellent conclusion to the first two novels in this trilogy, \\"Gildenford,\\" and \\"The Norman Pretender.\\"  These books make you feel as though you are living the lives of the characters, historical and fictional.  It brings the middle ages back to life and you can't help but feel the passions, love, anger, and all the emotions of the conquerors and the conquered.  They are all out-of-print but can be found and should be as this is a trilogy of the Norman Conquest that should not be missed!	2002-09-08
