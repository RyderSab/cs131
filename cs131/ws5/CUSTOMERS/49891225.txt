I discovered the slow-cooker when I moved in with my boyfriend; he had one.  Later, I found this book by accident, and put down Rachael Ray's books to buy this one.  I am VERY glad I did; I can't say enough good about it.  My favorite so far is the creamy blueberry french toast casserole (I think that's the correct title.)  OHMYGAWD.  Uses a cup of Splenda but it's INCREDIBLE.  I do miss French Toast, but not anymore with this creation.  Five or six meatloaves, and that's just for starters.  I will be using this a lot more than Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meals 2, and I like Rachael Ray!  <br />Get a crockpot or two, and get cooking!  You can't go wrong!!!	2004-03-10

If you have an interest in yoga at all, or your friends are telling you that you need it (like mine do) then this is a good place to start.

Biscotti was &quot;hot&quot; at that time, and she has an easy recipe for it to bag and give as gifts. Gift baskets are included as well as something called a &quot;crazy quilt,&quot; which looks easy and I hope to attempt one day (mostly to use up all my fabric scraps.)  <br />While some of the other reviewers called it &quot;girly,&quot; and I agree, but there are more ideas than most people would use.  Mrs. Warner's other books also contain the same types of ideas. <br />The overblown bridal &quot;industry&quot; will have you believe that if you want a &quot;proper&quot; wedding, spending $10K to $20K is reasonable. It's not. It is NOT necessary to mortgage your future on a one-day event. That kind of money is a degree!  Enjoy your day, of course, but don't blow it on a party.  Reasonably priced weddings with all the trimmings are possible. I did it, and it was because I did research before I spent a dime.	2003-04-11

The projects are great, some bigger than others, but I was really hoping for a definitive saw blade case. It's &quot;use your own imagination&quot; for that plus a few others. That's fine, but I was looking for more stuff to make, more practical, and something different.  Still, I'll get some good use out of it, the water bottle holder, the lunch sack, apron, tool roll, and the visor caddy will get made for people, but not the stuff like Mary Mulari makes.	2003-03-22

I was hoping for something closer to a big briefcase or other suitable bag that didn't look like a tote bag. The \\"Two Totes in One\\" I made recently is great, and I hope to make more. I suggest a heavy fabric if you are going to be carrying heavy books like I do.  The \\"Double Duty\\" bag is also one I like, and will try that when I find the right fabric. The City Pack is another for \\"one day,\\" I really like it. I plan to make several other of the projects eventually, but for right now I'm going to attempt the ones that look the easiest.

It takes a little measuring and drawing, but once you make your template I'm sure it works fine.

Books	5	13	14	N	N	More good food from the best.	This newest book has more \\"homestyle\\" food than that previous ones, plus more information about health, real nutrition, and a huge section for Frequently Asked questions.  Also, for a number of reasons, more of these recipes utilize SomerSweet, her non-chemical sweetner available only online.  It's good, I've used it, but it tends to be expensive and I have to wait to buy more.  Somersweet does the job perfectly, and until it's available in grocery stores. . .well.  But you do not have to have the Somersize food products to use this book--they work well without them too. Even if you never buy her food products--which happened because of public demand for them--you will enjoy this book.  Our favorites so far are Cheeseburger Pie, Stuffed Bell Peppers, and Somersized Shake it and Bake it Chicken.  You can also chat with other Somersizers at SuzanneSomers.com (go to Community, then Discussion or Chat.)<br />I have all of them.

Not only is this book more of the same delicious food that fits the Somersize guidelines, it's additional information plus the \\"rules\\" for Somersizing, which was not in the 3rd book. One caveat, a few of the recipes call for something only available on Suzannesomers.com.  It's not a big deal, but for Somersweet you can substitute pure crystalline fructose or saccharin, both of which are less expensive and easy to get. (Splenda, I don't know, I haven't tried it yet, but she eschews chemical sweetners.)  I made the Southwest Eggs-In-A-Pan Casserole, and it's fabulous, and easy to make ahead, as is the Spinach \\"Bread\\" for Green Eggs and Ham, or any other concoction you'd like.  Flexibility is another plus for Somersizing, but if you have been doing this a while, you know that.  A lot of pictures of her family, a lot of insight, and as one would expect, a lot of good food.

While I'm still Somersizing, I wasn't ingesting enough carbs and doing &quot;Level Two&quot; so I can get more carbs, like brown rice and whole wheat bread (especially after I get a breadmaker in here.)

I can't seem to get past the easiest projects, but this is a complete collection of baby gear to start on when the test is positive (and the rabbit is still warm!)

The rustic bench in the middle of the trees is a great idea, ditto the outside shower, but only if you live where there will be no peeping Toms. While you may not be able to duplicate her ideas exactly, these should give you inspiration to work with what you have at home, wherever that may be.	2002-03-20

I have used this book so many times I can't even count. My apartment is a testament to Martha Stewart, and when I buy a house, it will be even worse.  I can't tell you how the dishwashing soap bottle just improves the look of the kitchen, not to mention using the concentrated stuff and diluting it with water saves money and the environment.  Just so many things, I can't count. . .little things, that make it go a long way.  See also Good Things For Organizing, which gave me four things to use the night I got it.	2001-09-20

Although, like the rest of the &quot;Christmas with Martha Stewart&quot; books, they are republished features from the magazine, this one is pretty good. You do not have to use red and green every year; Silver, white, and even pastel colors can be used festively.  I love the neat snowman article; unfortunately, here in Houston, we don't get much snow!

I can personally vouch for the pear bread pudding and the torta di riso--a lot of work but like a lot of things, WELL worth the effort. I don't know if I could do all of those things at once for one activity, especially the wedding at home.  But in addition to all the recipes and chapters, it's idea-inspiring.

It's almost mechanical, but that's the idea--to explain this Buddhism to the Western World (especially Americans!), are accustomed to reading things like technical manuals and reading newspapers online. It's just the way we are \\"hard-wired,\\" and it's written BY Americans FOR Americans, or anyone else who would like to read it. Less theory, more substance, and more of what you check out Buddhism for. It's an easy read, too--about 210 pages, double spaced, big margins.  ... <br />As I tell new members (as well as a few old ones) \\"It's all about the practice.\\"  That's it.  Everyting else is superflous. The practice is everything, and it's explained in this book--how, when, where, what and why, as well as \\"case studies\\" of members who changed something with the practice and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo.  Millions of people can't be wrong.  Again, it's all about the practice, and how to go about it.  <br />So--what are you waiting for?	2001-07-06
US	49891225	R229F1Z1SHD0UY	0609607502	150226186	The Martha Stewart Living Cookbook	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Perfect companion to The Martha Stewart Cookbook	This book is culled from 10 years of the magazine, and that's great--if you don't own a bunch of the other books. I do, and I've noticed that a lot of stuff gets republished. I didn't buy the book \\"Comfort Foods,\\" because I already had much of it elsewhere. But guess what? The Gingerbread Snacking Cake from \\"Comfort Foods\\" is also in this book. I am, however, disappointed, that my favorite apple snacking cake from october or November 1996 was not in this book; that has to be my all time favorite cake, where you make the applesauce and then make the cake--my Auntie still talks about that cake, and I hope to make it agani one day (if I can find the recipe in the old magazine.) It's actually a very good book, \\"the best of the best,\\" they say, especially if you have only become a subscriber or viewer recently. But still, if you're buying lots of the other smaller books, you'll find some repetition. That being said, the Bacon and Egg Pie, which was published in May 2000 in an article on doing breakfast, is without equal. Rich, creamy, (any low-carbers and Somersizers paying attention?) and full of what you eat breakfast for. Mushrooms, fried crisp in bacon grease, slivered bell peppers, bacon (of course) Parmesan and goat cheese (I've used other white cheeses with great success)and--YES!--cream. Cup and a half. Make this on the weekend for the entire week, and maybe some home made sausage too, if you're of a mind to do so. Fabulous. The Lemon Poppyseed Snacking cake went over well at a religious activity, as did the Gingerbread Snacking cake. Not too sweet, and VERY good. Yum. If you like to cook (or eat), this would be a good addition to your collection, especially if you don't subscribe to the magazine. Enjoy!	2001-07-04

Attention Somersizers and other low-carb devotees--REAL good food in this book, and much of it low-carb!  Who can resist sugar snap peas in a bit of sesame oil? I can't. (I also can't get them washed fast enough to get them into the oil.) Since you eat the whole pod, they're veggies. I've always been a veggie eater, but I HATE Brussels Sprouts.  Ina Garten roasts them, and they are absolutely incredible as well as low carb.  The Grilled Salmon Salad and Lemon Chicken Salad will hold you up for a while--all low carb, too.  Granted the scones are anything but low-carb.  If you're doing an office party, or another kind of gathering, trust me--there won't be a crumb left of those cheddar-dill scones.	2001-06-21

But after years of gaining weight on a lowfat diet, I can't deny that I dropped 20 pounds with the Somersize system. I feel better since going totally decaf, an important part of this plan.  Caffeine does more damage than anyone realizes (See &quot;Caffeine Blues&quot; for more info on that subject.)  I'm not hungry all the time like I used to be, I'm satisfied after eating lunch, and I enjoy eating again.  I don't miss potatoes, carrots, bananas, and the other high-sugar/starch things I used to eat because I was told they are &quot;healthy.&quot;  Eventually, I hope to get rid of the rest of the weight I need to lose--but that's coming.  There isn't anything in the 7 rules of the plan that any nutritionist would argue with, although they would probably argue about the food combining business. I don't--it works, and the lady who loaned me the first SS book lost weight on it too.  <br />Some of the info is repeated, agreed, and one or two recipes were also repeated for the sake of new readers who might not yet have the first two books.  But still, the food is very good, no arguement about that.  If you start doing the deprivation thing, you'll never keep the weight off. And that's the whole point.  Yes, the family pictures get a bit much, but she writes from experience.  That's her experience, but she was also a teenage mother at one time, living paycheck to paycheck, like a lot of other people in this country.  She wasn't born into that lifestyle, she earned it.	2001-05-03

This is NOT a book for beginners--you must know what you're doing before attempting some of these things.  You at least have to know basics and have  some experience first.  But when you get the experience, you will like this  book!  I used this book to trim a rather blah-looking two piece light blue  suit, consisting of a skirt and short-sleeved, princess seamed top that  comes down to the hipline. (One of those &quot;See and Sew&quot; patterns  for $1.97.)  The cut was great, the style looked great--on paper.  I don't  know what it was, but despite my best hopes and efforts to pick the right  fabric, it just didn't look good.  I wore it twice but still didn't like  it. (Everybody else did--go figure.)  Flipped through this book, and  decided to give the Chanel-style trim a try.  If I ruined it, so what?   Worked like a charm.  Okay, my stitches aren't perfect, but it looks  infinitely better than it did before.  I also tried that YSL trick of  edgestitching the binding after topstitching it down--WOW.  I may try a  black suit with white trim next time. THAT will be great. <br />I have tried,  but unsuccessfully, the slanted welt pockets for skirts and pants from  Calvin Klein. Guess I'm just a math dummy--I couldn't make it work for  anything!  Next up: try to duplicate that Christian Doir top that's done up  in orange.  <br />I guess if I'd actually READ the book instead of flipping  through it like a reference book I'd get more use out of it!	2000-08-14

This is a collection of projects you can do in a short period of time, such as on a weekend. One or two, not ALL of them. I've done the simple bed canopy and I love it. Didn't take long, either! I've been doing flavored vinegars for Xmas gifts for years, and everyone loves them. The projects are easy and leave a lot of room for creativity and personal expression, and no right or wrong way to do them. They're also not as expensive as you might think. This is a good book for people who think that \\"decorating\\" means lots of loud flowery wall paper with upholstery fabric to match, new objects de art, and of course, lots of money. No, these are neat things that you can do to \\"redecorate\\" without \\"refinancing.\\" There are great gift ideas as well, although I've not tried glass etching just yet! May I respectfully suggest that you do a good spring cleaning before considering decorating. Can't tell you how many people I know that want to redecorate, but never think of cleaning up first. Clear out your closet, neaten it up, donate or dispose of unneeded things, (See Suze Orman's The Courage to be rich), repair anything that needs repair (upholstery, vacuum cleaners, replace a picture frame's glass, furniture/chair/sofa legs, etc.), then think about the colorwashing on the walls, or something else.

It's embarassing how many &quot;low fat and healthy&quot; cookbooks I own, and of course, not one has helped me lose anything.  No matter what I do, I can't lose any weight. . .until now.  I've only been on it since 3/1/00,  and lost a small amount, but that's partly because I haven't started  exercising yet.  Once my metabolism kicks in and I start burning off the  fat reserves, look out beach!  The scientific side of this theory is  explained by Dr. Schwarzbein, which I sincerely appreciated.  So THAT'S why  I can't lose any weight! This is the first time in 5 years that I've ever  seen myself shrink; no matter how &quot;healthy&quot; I've been eating, I  cannot lose any weight.  I recommend this book to anyone who is having the  same dilema.  Finally, I can cook food for my spouse who has since quit  griping about my &quot;experimental cooking.&quot; The spaghetti squash (he  won't eat that) is fantastic--first time in my life I've ever tried it, and  now I can't get enough of it. Even though I'm a level one, I recently made  the very easy lemon meringue pie for us that came out not only perfect, but  perfectly delicious.  It's gone, but I'll make it again.
