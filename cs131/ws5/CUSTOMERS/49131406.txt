I find it to be very effective and slick.  The students find the topics interesting, and the examples of language are real and useful.  This student's book is supplemented by a workbook, an audio cassette, a resource book and a teacher's book. You have to buy these separately.  There's also a video you can get, but we don't have it.<BR>The advanced course has twelve units: identity, taste, city, talk, luck, mind, cyberspace, law, first, stories, word, and conscience.  Each unit lasts a good 15 or so hours.  The workbook contains a separate writing course within it, which is well constucted, and I use it a lot.  The writing topics are perhaps a little on the dull side, but it's very helpful for structured writing practice.<BR>Inside Out is much better than Cutting Edge or Headway, in my opinion.  The activities are more interesting, modern and international, and the emphasis is more on using the language in context rather than on gap-fill exercises.  <BR>Perhaps it could update the music it includes, though.	2003-10-30
US	49131406	RYOJU98E0EKPZ	0345311485	12581581	On the Beach	Books	3	0	1	N	N	immensely depressing	After nuclear war wipes out the Northern hemisphere, the radiation gradually creeps South, killing everything in its path.  In Melbourne (at the time, the world's southernmost city), people realize they have only a few months to live, that there is no escape, and they sit and wait to die.  Pretty grim.  Of course, everyone is just finding ways to fill in the time and distract themselves. ... <br />'On the beach' has been quoted widely with regards to Australians referring to England as 'home' even though they'd never been there.  It's the only time I've ever come across that phenomenon.  I actually found that these 1950s Australians quite familiar and interesting: much more British than Australians nowadays, still in that stiff duty mode from the second world war, and facing certain death.  I think the listless writing style was very successful in conveying the sense of despair and doom. <br />It's a powerful novel, profound probably, and quite awful.	2002-09-03

Normally, I find them OK but irritating.  Miraculously, this one is different. <BR>Firstly, it's not too big (unlike, say, the Indian one) and is not afraid to leave some good stuff OUT.  Secondly, it's very well researched, which is impressive in Bangladesh because information isn't all that readily available.  Nor is it patronising in tone!  <BR>Best of all, though, is that reference to women travellers isn't restricted to a nauseating passage on what women &quot;shouldn't&quot; do because of the dangers, and then special women's diseases.  Instead, it actually suggests that there are advantages to being a woman and special places to visit (such as women's development programs) that might interest women in particular.  Yay!  Welcome to the 21st century LP!  I don't know what this sudden change in tone is due to, but I hope it spreads throughout the LP philosophy.<BR>Otherwise, the information is helpful and up-to-date.  The maps are a bit dodgy and could do with some work.  For example, Thanchi does NOT lie between Ruma and Keokradung, and nor is Keokradung the highest peak in Bangladesh.  The Chittagong map, in particular, is fairly useless. <BR>Still, a very nice job.  Very impressive.  Very interesting and well written.	2002-01-17

In retaliation, violence against Hindus spread across Bangladesh.  Thug violence is not uncommon in Bangladesh (particularly around election time), and Bangladesh is not a high-profile country, and so little comment was made about these events internationally.<BR>Naslim - originally a muslim herself (although now she claims to be an athiest) - wrote Shame in protest.  It took her 7 days, and it shows by being a raw, occasionally awkward book.  It follows the activities of the hindu anti-hero Suranjan, and his family, during the period of violence.  This is not a particularly extreme book.  In no way does it suggest that hindus are good and muslims are bad.  Instead, it explores the effect of violence and oppression on the psychology and relationships of people.  It feels very real.  It reminds me of David Grossman's writing on Israel: that the oppression contaminates both sides.  Grossman describes the situation there as two apples pressed together and rot spreading on both.<BR>Nasrin does not lie or exaggerate what happened in Bangladesh.  True, she does not include the full politics of India, Pakistan, British rule, partition etc., but that's because this is a novel about a family in Bangladesh.  Its scale is intimate.<BR>While Nasrin's novel is not extreme, the reaction to it is.  Islamic fundamentalists have offered a large cash reward to anybody who murders her.  She now lives outside Bangladesh.<BR>I like Nasrin.  I like her honesty, intense intelligence and courage, all of which come through in this book.  Elsewhere, she has made comments about abolishing Quranic law because of its discrimination of women.  I like that too.<BR>Bangladesh is a forgotten country.  Inside it, controversial, informed voices (especially women's) are rarely heard.  The country needs people like Nasrin.  People should read books like hers, whether or not their views are the same.  It's intelligent to do so.	2002-01-17

Obviously, the epics are much condensed (the original Mahabharata is over 100,000 stanzas of verse and the longest composition in the world).  Narayan describes his method as writing from memory the stories, focusing on personalities and plot, and ignoring the massive philosophical interludes (which can run to hundreds of pages - the Bhagavad Gita for example - and are often published separately in the English interpretation) and so this is a retelling rather than a translation.<br />The stories themselves are wonderful, the Mahabharata especially.  They are thought to have been writen several thousand years B.C., and still important in India today.  In the Ramayana, the demon Ravana is given protection so that he cannot be killed by a supernatural being, so Vishnu comes to earth in human form (as the perfect prince Rama) to defeat Ravana.  In his task he is assisted by various people including the monkey god Hanuman.<br />The Mahabharata is the story of the conflict between the five divine Pandava brothers and their one hundred cousins who want to destroy them.  This story is particularly interesting, and wise, and sometimes funny.<br />I found the stories to be fascinating and a good insight into Indian culture.  I'm in India at the moment, and a lot of things have become more clear to me after reading this book.  It's fun to read.	2001-12-07

Their plan is to not interfere in any way, not to give charity, but just to learn Bengali and observe and learn about life in the village, and then to write a book about it.  The result is fascinating and moving.  Each chapter is dedicated to a particular person or situation, and the dynamics and different constraints are carefully described and explained.  Sometimes, the stories are quite confronting - one story is about a very poor family who sell everything they own and can't get enough work, and slowly starve to death.  A strong theme in the book is that some of the very poor people in Bangladesh are in a situation that they can't get out of.  Even if they are smart, even though they work to their maximum all day every day, circumstances mean that they often slip further into poverty and starvation.  They also do a nice job covering the different roles and experiences of men and women, hindus and moslems, and rich and poor.<br />Hartman and Boyce always try to be objective and just.  The last few chapters are an analysis of the economic situation in Bangladesh.  They write very well.  I picked up this book reluctantly because I am going to Bangladesh and feel obliged to read about it.  I could barely put the book down.  I strongly recommend it to anybody who is interested in different cultures and, in particular, in the balance of wealth and why it is that the world ends up so unequal and so full of poverty.<br />Just a little note: since this book was published, other schemes have taken off in Bangladesh, including the microlending scheme to women.  Perhaps the view is a little bleak now?  I'm not sure.	2001-11-24

Danziger spent several months in Afghanistan while they were at war.  I found it a little bit obsure, in places, but he seems to have roamed around with a gang of Afghanistan men, met rebel leaders, and survived appalling conditions.  For example, he described Russian helicopters hovering over a village and destroying while he watched on a hillside.  He was so taken up with his experiences there that he kept on his Afghanistan outfit for the rest of his trip, and even wore it for the first few weeks back in Britain.  Nick sounds a lot like a hard-eyed idealist.  He put his safety in the hands of others a lot, and took a lot of risks.  Much of his time was spent trying to cross borders, and dealing with officials.  <br />This is a very nice answer to all those types who claim that there is nowadays there is nothing more to explore, and no adventures to be had.<br />Travel writing can be annoying, but I found this book fascinating and very readable.  Afghanistan, one of the most dangerous and closed-off places on Earth, is always going to be interesting.	2001-06-20

Katherine Paterson writes well, but this book does not have the complexity or the punch of Bridge to Teribithia.  Park, an eleven year old boy lives with his mother.  His father died in Vietnam, but his mother won't talk about him.  At Park's insistance, he is allowed to go on a visit for two weeks to his father's family, where he finds out about the family history.  Park is fascinated with stories about King Arthur and knights and chivalry, and he often day dreams about his life and his father in those terms.  Predictably, the truth is a grim contrast.<br />This is not a particularly happy or comforting story.  Nor does it have the emotional depth of Katherine Paterson's other books.  I would not have liked it much when I was in the 10-12 age-group.  At 27, it was worth the 40 minutes it took to read.	2001-04-26

It's nice, and it's funny.  It's about a girl/woman and what she learns about people/men/relationships.  It's been compared to sex and the city - it's more intelligent, sweeter, and less raunchy than that; but that's the general idea. It's book candy, but much less offensive than normal stuff in the genre.  I think that the reason is because the heroine has other important relationships in her life other than Men, and that she is able to maintain her dignity most of the time.<br />On the other hand, there is nothing more profound here than can be found in girl magazines.  I don't really mean to compare her to Austen.  <br />I was disappointed when it ended and there was nothing more to read.	2001-02-17

He spent his whole life studying the middle east, and he lived in Lebanon and Israel for years as a reporter.  He (deservedly) won fame and fortune for that book.  It's revolutionary.  If you haven't read it, do so.  Then, the new york times brought him back to the US, and made him their globalization expert.  Why?  Who knows.  He spoke to some economists and other experts, travelled a lot, and got really excited about his success and new job.<br />This book, about globalization, isn't nearly as good.<br />Oh sure, he can still Write, and the book is easy to read, full of entertaining anecdotes, and fairly thought provoking.  It's when he tries to pull together his Grand Theories of Everything that it becomes embarrassing.  He just doesn't seem to have a good grasp of his subject.  When talking about free trade, for example, his argument goes something like this:  &quot;Well, it works and nothing else does, so you'd have to be pretty stupid to want anything else because it doesn't work.  It just doesn't.  So there.  Now, let me tell you about that cool, cool time when I was in a small village in Kazakhstan...&quot;<br />Thomas himself is much more present in this book.  In Beirut, he took a back seat to his description of the people and events he was seeing.  In The Lexus and the Olive Tree, there is a distinct thread running through it:  Look at me, look at me, how cool am I? Frankly, I think he deserves to be a tad conceited, but it affects his writing.<br />Still, this is still an interesting book.  There's nothing better out there as far as I'm aware.  I just wish I hadn't read his other book first.  It's sad to see someone go from brilliant to good.	2001-02-17

It's a selection of short, non-fiction, stories about different aspects of mountaineering and the types of people that do it.  Krakauer is very, very good at writing.  He's funny and entrancing.  This book is more about people than about mountaineering.  Read it even if you're not into the sport, or if you're put off by macho posturing.  It's not like that at all.<br />The articles in the book include a description of ice-climbing; a horrifying account of a particularly murderous year on K2; various profiles of particularly interesting mountaineers; a very funny description of what to do if trapped for days in a tent in a storm; a history of glacier flying; and some of the author's personal climbing experiences, including some awkward cross-cultural encounters with French climbers.	2001-02-17

In 1928, Virginia Woolf (in A Room of One's Own)complained they we don't know how women in the past spent their time.  We don't, and it's extraordinary how much a little bit of information about these women can change the way we think about society, women and history.  The brilliance of this book lies in its ordinariness.  Martha Ballard's life is not described in such detail because of anything she did that was unusual or exceptional.  She was an ordinary women who worked hard and raised her family like so many have done.  No, the fascination comes from the fact that such women (and their impact on society and social change) are usually invisible to us.  Sometimes, as a modern woman, I find it hard not to despise many of the women you read about in history books: pathetic, passive, ignorant, helpless, victims, or Great Heroines.  Martha Ballard is just like a woman we might know today: bossy, sensible, often (I would imagine) fairly stubborn.  She had great influence on the society in which she lived.  It's a mistake to think that this book is only for feminists or history buffs(as some have written) just because it's about a woman.  It involves a qualitative shift in the way we think about history, and as such it demands our respect.  This is one of the most important books I have read for years, and I can't recommend it highly enough.	2000-12-03

Psmith isn't in this book; it's about the early school experiences of his pal Mike in the days before they met.  While it's funny in places, it's by no means up to Wodehouse's usual standard.  Possibly for it's target audience (young English boys) it works well, I'm in no position to say.  Given the very large number of books by Wodehouse that are superb, there seems not much reason to bother with this one.	2000-11-17

Part of  the book is travel writing - the wacko Australian situations and characters  he meets are fully described - part the history/psychology/philosophy of  nomadic living and human aggression, and part a poetic description of  Aboriginal culture.<br />The link between a human sedentary existance and  human aggression has long been described; Bruce presents sedentary living  as an unnatural state, and the nomadic lifestyle as cleaner, more beautiful  and better.  It's very convincing while you're reading it, and certainly  deeply interesting.  It's certainly a refreshing counterpoint to thinking  about all those land-related wars and situations (Israel, for example), to  all the nastiness of European colonization in America, Africa, and  Australia, and it has a certain intuitive appeal - land belongs to  everyone!<br />I'm not certain how accurate Bruce's description of Aboriginal  culture is, but I don't think it really matters.  This is not a carefully  constructed sociological or anthropological analysis, but rather a lyrical,  and fairly romantic, description of nomadic life and a way of thinking.   Most importantly, I think, the message is: the ways the Aboriginies think  and relate to the land are powerful and beautiful and so different to what  we're used to that it's very difficult for Westerners to appreciate them  immediately.  <br />I strongly recommend this book, because it outlines a way  of thinking about the human condition that is nice, and that lingers in  your mind for a long time.	2000-09-02

It was completely  perfect in that it covers the fundamentals of neuroscience in slightly more  detail than one needs (unlike most textbooks which always seem to do  everything in slightly less detail).  Just like you always feel that you  have to be clutching a calculator when you're studying physics, so you need  this for any kind of neural science studying.  It has clear, lavish  pictures and everything is thorough and easy to understand.<br />And, oh boy,  what a Book!  You really feel that you've got something for your money.  It's hefty, it's intellectual, and it looks damned good on the bookshelves.  The paper is glossy, everything's set out well, and you feel good every  time you refer to it.<br />When I was a student, my general principle was to  BUY NO TEXTBOOKS, and this one was very expensive for me at the time, but  it was worth it.  Probably the most valuable book I had in all my 8 years  of formal studying.  It contained everything I needed in terms of  information on this topic, and on the rare occasions when I had to go  further into something, there were very useful references at the end of  every chapter.<br />I strongly recommend it.  You'll use it for years, and  when it's time to move on, it'll be easy to sell.	2000-08-16

It's a great read.  This is my bias (and was  before I read this book): I don't like Freud's stuff.  I think it's absurd,  unhelpful and particularly damaging to women.  Furthermore, I have come  across no evidence to support it.  For this reason, reading a book bashing  Freud did not in any way offend me.  I enjoyed it.  People who quite like  Freud, however, might not like this book so much. Actually, there is not  very much at all about Freud's theories and publications(except his very  early stuff), it's more a summary of Freud's acts of dishonesty and faking  of evidence, and a general description of an obnoxious character who  somehow sucked in an entire generation.  <br />There's a broad description of  the precursors to modern psychology at the end of the 19th and the  beginning of the 20th century, which I found fascinating and recommend to  anybody interested in the history of psychology.	2000-08-16
US	49131406	R1SJ8QE4BSHWUE	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	11	13	N	N	brilliant prose	Nabokov's genius is even more bewildering when you consider that English is not his first (nor even his second, I think), language and that he moved  to America well into his adulthood.  This is the only thing by Nabokov I  have ever read (but will not be the last unless I die suddenly in the next  few days) and his prose is extraordinary.  It's direct, biting, and yet as  lyrical as poetry.  This is a book that can be read many times without loss  of richness.  <br />The content of this book is notorious.  It is also very  touching.  It's a perfect tragedy.  Now then.  Lolita is far from being a  sugary sweet angel.  She has had sex before, she is manipulative,  self-contained, seductive, crass...but  so clearly through the voice of  Humbert (the older man) you can see how young she is, how horribly abused,  and how he is slowly destroying her.<br />Why would anybody ever want to read  such a thing?  For two reasons (in my opinion).  Firstly, as I mentioned  above, because Nabokov is a great artist.  Very few books I have read come  close to his craftsmanship in terms of stringing words together.<br />Secondly  because abuse happens.  People will gain control over others and then not  act in their best interests.  It happens, it can be horrible, and so it  makes sense to examine it as part of the human condition.  On the cover of  this paperback edition, Vanity Fair claims it is &quot;the greatest love  story of all time&quot;, which seems a little weird, given that this  &quot;love&quot; is completely one-sided and involves assaulting, trapping,  manipulating and destroying a young girl. <br />But don't get the wrong  impression.  The content is dark, but the mood of the book is surprisingly  light; and there are distinct passages and descriptions that are downright  beautiful.<br />There are a lot of books around, but very few of this quality.   Really.  Read it.	2000-08-15

It's fascinating, and the characters are so vibrant and real that you can  almost smell them.  There is a lot of talk in the introduction about how  Napolean is treated as a villain in England, and how this book runs counter  to that.  I have never been exposed to that bias, so it didn't affect me.   What was interesting, though, was how Napolean's early success set him up  for his later, spectacular defeats.  The book covers the events from  Napolean's birth to his death, and even if you end up not entirely in  sympathy with his actions during his life, you still can maintain sympathy  for him as a person, and for France at that crazy time in its history.  The  best thing about this book, though, is its readability.  You can swap it  for some popular adventure/romance/light reading novel, and actually learn  something without your brain hurting at all.	2000-08-09

There's no question that  this short, intense pamphlet is very interesting (harmless review so far,  right?) Valerie Solanos is famous for having shot Andy Warhol, and on the  whole I don't believe in reading books by criminals. Why encourage them?  On the other hand, VS has long since passed away.  The facts of her life  (shooting people, being a prostitute, living on the streets, studying  psychology at college) are important to consider because otherwise it might  be easy to toss this thing off as a joke (it's actually very very funny in  my opinion) when of course, it's serious and potentially (I suppose)  harmful.<br />An interesting thing to consider is: how would it be if the  genders were reversed and we had instead (and this is, I think, where I  have to choose my words carefully) and man who proposed to eliminate women  from the earth, and then gave reasons why.  I console myself by thinking  that this manifesto would still be funny and absurd and disturbing and  thought provoking.<br />I have never got much into the whole anarchy thing  before, but I think that it's interesting and intelligent to consider it,  and especially to clarify why you might be against such a path of  action.<br />This pamphlet describes what Valerie Solanos believes in.  I do  not question her sincerity, given her history.  I must say, when I consider  the world that she must have perceived from her position and her  experiences; then it is possible to see why an intelligent and brave woman  could reach such conclusions (although I heartily disagree with them of  course).  I strongly recommend this book, because it's very much outside  the normal way of writing and thinking.  It pushes the boundaries (of  thinking, I mean, not of acting), and that's good, right?<br />Also, it's very  short.	2000-08-09

Ah, Peter Carey, writing at length about Australia without ever resorting to cliches.  If you are not Australian, I don't  think you can really understand what a relief it is to read something like  this about Australia.  First of all, there is a nationalistic hero  (nationalism and pride in (white) Australia is something so rare that the  novelty is enough to sustain the entire book); secondly, the characters  (including the women) are interesting and convincing; thirdly, I am  completely homesick and this is so Australian; fourthly, he creates a new  kind of poetry (new to me anyway).  I didn't like the part about snake  dancing, and the characters change too quickly (for example, Charles and  Phoebe) and you kind of lose the thread.  I like the way he dances about  with truth, and I like the deep sadness about us losing our identity  (whether or not it's true).  I recognize a lot of the characters and the  patterns of events from my own relatives and ancestors.  I've never seen  these things outside Australia, and you forget them, so thank goodness  someone's documenting it all.  This is so impressive if it's his first  book.  Read it.	2000-08-02

You can see over a thousand reviews on the same book if  you spell memoires with only one 'e'.  I liked this book very much but I  was deceived into thinking it was a biography, when of course it's pure  fiction.  I think a lot of its success comes from that deception.	2000-08-02
US	49131406	R3GBHDD3N1PZIF	0804115761	785795777	A Thousand Acres	Books	2	1	8	N	N	boring and awful	I gave this book two stars, because it's not actively offensive, but I found it to be next to unreadable because it is so boring!  It's about what  happens to these people who live on farms (in midwest America I think) and  all sorts of family crises and estrangements.  I'm new to the midwest, so  perhaps I'm missing something, but I found all the characters to be  unintelligent and drippy.  They spend a lot of time moaning about, and not  a lot of time actually doing anything proactive.  It's yet another story  about weak, passive women who come to the realization that they are  Victims.  For baby boomers only.	2000-08-02

This book, as far as I can remember, is cool.  It's about pioneer types and who loves who and who rides with who through  the bush and floods and fire and stuff.  As far as I can remember, this  isn't really meaty literature like some of MF's other stuff; but it's a  good read!  Kind of like a tougher, Australian version of all those Anne at  Green Gables books.	2000-07-24
US	49131406	R2TK2C8XH2RMUW	0671459155	123326531	My Brilliant Career	Books	5	23	23	N	N	astonishing book	I'm not exactly sure, but I think that MF wrote this book when she was still fairly young (16 or 17), and it sends shivers down my spine to think of a young girl with such energy and pride so long ago.  This is a story  about a girl in Australia end of the 19th century, and what happens to her  when she visits other families and places and the decisions she makes.   Some of the decisions she makes seem to be fairly self-destructive, and  it's interesting to think about why she made them - too young to know  better, too scared, not able to compromise.  The heroine is a very strong  character, flawed but understandable.  I really, really like this book  (incidentally, my ex-boyfriend found it almost unreadable).  I think of it  as relating to feminism; but that's just my bias.  It's actually just a  good yarn. <br />Hmm.  Australian women have their own history.  Is this  interesting to anyone other than myself?	2000-07-24
US	49131406	RTFS4LZOSQHKS	0297815989	223878080	Over Here	Books	4	6	7	N	N	most interesting diplomacy	I love the way diplomats talk!  Here is someone joking about American and English culture in a way that seems sharp, but is really so smooth it offends nobody (I assume.  I'm not British or American, so I'm just  guessing).  I love it.  It's most educational.  I especially like the part  where he describes M. Thatcher and the way she treats American senators.   Ah yes, what a woman!  Towards the end, he describes his fall from grace  with the American president.  It was kind of glossed over, but since I was  expecting nothing of the kind from the former ambassador to London, it  seemed to be fairly honest bitterness.  Overall, I really liked this book.   It was funny, and it was a glimpse into the lives of the privileged.  Nice.	2000-07-24

It's about this two English boys at school.  The school-story genre is fairly grim, I know, with all it's  moralizing and weird relationships between students etc., but this is so  completely funny.  It's probably my favorite of all the Psmith books  (although, Leave it to Psmith is fairly excellent as well).	2000-07-24
US	49131406	RQ81CWT6E7MZ0	0571118372	484283017	Run Away Home	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Worst of the best	Of course, I adore all of Antonia Forest's stuff, and it's a privilege to read them since they are so difficult to get hold of. That being said, this is probably my least favourite of all the books I've read in the series. It's kind of like she just tossed this one off. It's the christmas vacation just after attic term, and Mrs Marlow has to head off to France, so the family (including Giles, and except Ginty who's at Monica's place) is left alone. The run away home part refers, I think, to this young French boy who is trying to escape from an orphanage in England and who the Marlows interact with a little. But what's new in this novel? Where is the usual stuff of characters being stretched? New interactions? Unresolved misunderstandings? Where's the excitement that I normally get from her when quietly, slowly you see these people (who seem completely real) reveal themselves, develop into the beginning of adults, become suspended in some kind of new situation, or new light? Not here. Not really. Like I say, it just seems that AF did it quickly. Of course, (and this is why I give it 5 stars) it's still excellent stuff. I would rather read AF than not. I would rather read run away home than 99% stuff I find on bookshelves (I can't of course because I don't have a copy, and it's nowhere to be found. I read a photo-copy of it).	2000-07-22
US	49131406	R15QBD1TBDZJJW	0156935805	757354521	Virginia Woolf: A Biography	Books	4	6	10	N	N	Woolf group	The most interesting thing about this biography was the voice of the writer: Quentin Bell who was Virginia's nephew.  The assumptions he makes, and the way he judges things are kind of foreign to me, and I think it  gives an idea about how things must have been for the Bloomsbury types.   Virginia has written that you need to have a clear, unbiased mind to write  good fiction; perhaps for non-fiction, bias can be interesting. This is the  only biography of Virginia Woolf I have ever read.  He made her seem fairly  weak, which was hard to reconcile with how strong and bright her writing  is.  This is a lot more than a collection of facts, and I recommend it.	2000-07-21

It's good for you, because by making you feel ignorant and stupid, it keeps you humble.  It tired out my brain quite quickly, not because it was hard to read, but because the content makes you  think!  I really recommend this book.  It's about (I know what it's about  because for this 20th anniversary addition, DH writes an intro explaining  what it's about) how self-referencial systems behave, including the human  brain. But of course, there are massive digressions.  DH is playing with  you in places, just for fun.  I really like the sharpness of this, the cool  logic of it, the playfulness, and of course the challenge!  The other thing  is that I never really appreciated Escher's art until I got my hands on  this book.	2000-07-21
US	49131406	R1CBH3SPJZF078	0027357813	608912926	A Long Way from Verona	Books	5	18	19	N	N	favourite book of all time	This is my favourite book of all time.  I never get tired of reading it.   It's about this thirteen year old girl in England during the second world  war, and stuff that happens to her over a year or two.  It's one of those  books where the girl is narrating and perceiving one thing but you (with  your superior wisdom and experience) can see more than she does.  I think  it's very real and subtle and a true statement of what it's like to be a  teenage girl.  This part is so true, that I feel like I'm really learning  about how it must have been like during the war in England.  So often I  feel a disconnect when people write about this age group.	2000-07-18

Three Guineas is VW second book that is an argument and not  fiction (the first is a room of one's own).  It's about how women can help  prevent war, and it says a lot of stuff, one of the things being to link  male vanity to aggression. It's controversial, and a lot less pleasant than  a room of one's own.  It's weird in retrospect, too, because her argument  stands in another time - before the second world war - and we've all  changed since the holocaust etc. It says a lot about feminism, too, and  women entering the professions and getting an education.  Like I say, it's  more aggressive than ARoOO, and this makes her less likeable. Whether or  not you like it, though, or agree with what she says, it's an argument that  should be out there.  It's something that should be said.	2000-07-18

It comes in two broad sections: the first part talks  about the geology of Africa and about how people lived in relation to the  land and how they survived there.  This part is about people who lived with  no (or very scarce) written records.  It's done very well. Reader is very  knowledgeable about the most recent theories and discoveries in human  evolution .  It's relevant, of course, to the history of the world and not  just Africa. The second part is about what happened once Europeans and  other types headed back in to Africa.  This part reads a bit like a news  summary.  It's interesting, it's detailed (horrific in places), and it's  only part of the story.  That's fair enough, though.  Goodness me, you  can't have everything in one book. My position was: I know nothing at all  about Africa.  I need to start somewhere.  This was an excellent book for  that purpose.	2000-07-18
US	49131406	R1C57WFIAIL0HO	0156787334	891560072	A Room of One's Own	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Completely likeable	Ah, Virginia!  Never is she more charming or likeable than when she writes  this book.  This is a very important book nowadays, I think, when a lot of  women who have gained a lot from the feminist movement are now saying  &quot;I'm not a feminist&quot;, perhaps because the word is now associated  with aggression and intolerance.  Let's not get into that argument!  But  anyway, A Room of One's Own, is cool because it makes you feel good about  being a woman, and it highlights so gently and kindly and humorously the  biases that may exist in your own mind and in society around you about what  women can and can't and should do.  I read somewhere that VW was motivated  to cheer up young women who seemed so depressed.  It works! I don't know  what other people think: is there irony in the way she talks about how  women must flatter and please and be charming to get their way; and then  she herself is so flattering and charming in this book?  I don't know.  I  learnt a lesson, though, about how to argue. I wish VW were alive.  I've  wanted for years now to contact her and say thankyou, and then to tell her  how things are going these days.	2000-07-18
US	49131406	R16S5OBQILFDWQ	9997966635	258336141	Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Reads Slaughter House Five (Swc 1376)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	time disjointed	I didn't like this book the first time I read it (or even the second  time), but by the third or fourth time, I was beginning to get it, and by  the fifth time I was bawling. The book is made up of a series of short  passages that don't really follow each other chronologically.  Some seem to  be from KV's own experiences, some from his hero, some are obviously  imaginary, others not.  It's confusing. I guess the point is (I don't know  if this was KV's point, but this is what I get out of it) that when you  come face to face with something so horrible, then time kind of shatters.   I've found this in my own experience.  So, Dresden was firebombed.  Is that  over now?  It is, but if you were there, it's still playing in your mind (I  suppose).  I've seen people die in pain, and although it was years ago,  sometimes it feels like it's happening right now, I can feel the pain  physically. Other times not.  In any case, it shapes everything I  experience.  Every detail of life interacts with what happened years ago.   Slaughter house 5 is the only book I have ever read that even comes close  to capturing this experience. I think it's a very important book.	2000-07-18

I have never been to Israel, but  I've met israeis out and about.  The violence of the opinions that people  hold about israel etc. are difficult to handle sometimes.  My admiration  has always been for people who can discuss such intense issues squarely and  without losing their cool.  Oz does this.  I don't know how fair the book  is, or how reasonable, but was like holding dynamite in my hands.   Each  chapter develops the arguments presented by a different person/group of  people.  It leaves the impression of brave, passionate people in an intense  country.  Usually I can read a book from cover to cover, but this time is  was like: read a chapter, recover for a few days, read another one. I  strongly recommend this book.  In some places it's beautiful.	2000-07-18
