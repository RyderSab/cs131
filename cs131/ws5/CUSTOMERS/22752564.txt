That would probably be Annie Dillard's \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.\\" I wouldn't recommend that to everyone, though, because not everyone likes such ornate prose, and not everyone cares that much about nature.<br /><br />The list goes on and on - books that have one or more qualities that are superior to their parallel qualities in \\"Dinner.\\" Books that have more gripping plotting or juicy characterizations or unforgettable settings.<br /><br />What makes \\"Dinner with a Perfect Stranger\\" a book that I would recommend to everyone I know?<br /><br />\\"Dinner\\" presents Christianity in a way that might prove to be accessible to audiences that have not been able to understand it.<br /><br />There is one fact about Christianity that Christians, non-Christians, and those hostile to Christianity can't deny: Christianity is very, very powerful.<br /><br />Because Christianity is so powerful, those hostile to it have devoted epic amounts of energy to distorting it. For a sampling of this distortion, one need only take a glimpse at an \\"editorial review\\" of this very book that Amazon features on the page for this book. \\"Publishers Weekly\\" claims that Gregory's book makes \\"misleading statements about . . . Islam\\" in an \\"unfair caricature.\\" Here Publishers Weekly is voicing the doctrine of Political Correctness.<br /><br />Let's set the record straight: David Gregory's book makes not one single \\"misleading statement\\" about Islam; it offers no \\"unfair caricature.\\" The book does mention that Mohammed, when he was in his fifties, married a six-year-old girl. Political Correctness denies us the right to be aware of that historical fact, and so any book or author who mentions it is calumnied by enforcers of Politically Correct thought.<br /><br />By the way, Shame on Publishers Weekly for printing that libel of David Gregory, and shame on Amazon for using that libel as a featured review. It would really be a shame if Publishers Weekly libelous review were to turn readers away from this marvelous book.<br /><br />So, yes, there are those out there, right-wingers, left-wingers, self-identified believers, and self-identified skeptics who recognize the great power of Christianity and do everything they can to distort Christianity in the public's eyes. Why do they do this? Because they want *their* distorted version of Christianity to be the accepted one.<br /><br />The gift, the universal gift, of Gregory's book is that he uses a wonderful little device to allow a reader to see and assess \\"mere Christianity\\" with new eyes.  And that is why I would recommend this book to everyone I know.<br /><br />Gregory writes, with subtle sophistication, to *everyone.* He's not honing his words to meet the needs and expectations of any given audience. He's stating the simple truths of Christianity in the kind of basic language that Jesus used.<br /><br />As a believer, I was entranced by this book. No matter how short, I rarely read a book in one sitting. I read this one in one sitting. I was crying throughout the final portion.<br /><br />I would really like to read reports of non-Christians reading this book. I suspect that it will reach audiences that haven't been reached by other media.<br /><br />So, yes, I want to recommend this book to everyone I know. I had one other reaction to \\"Dinner with a Perfect Stranger.\\" I wanted to contact David Gregory, and thank him.denies us the right to be aware of that historical fact, and so any book or author who mentions it is calumnied by enforcers of Politically Correct thought.   <br /> <br />By the way, Shame on Publishers Weekly for printing that libel of David Gregory, and shame on Amazon for using that libel as a featured review.

I don't know how to fix that, so I'm going to write another review.<br /><br />I love this book. It is as generous, salty and wise as a good grandmother.<br /><br />I can't think of a person, or type of person, who wouldn't enjoy this book.  Well, all right, all right, maybe a serial killer wouldn't like it, but, other than that ...<br /><br />Really. Insights about love, about hearts, presented in a fun and warm way. That's what you get in this book.	2005-08-08

I opened to the first pages, waiting for the inevitable Follett moment when I'd be so hooked that I couldn't wait to just sit and read to the final pages. That moment never came.<br /><br />I didn't care about what was at stake here, which surprised me. Like many, I am fascinated by the prospect of bio-terror and the power of tropical diseases. I also find security devices pretty interesting. How do you contain lightening in a bottle?<br /><br />I liked Toni Gallo, the female lead. The scenes where she interacts with her loser ex-boyfriend were insightful, especially so given that they were written by a man.<br /><br />But then too, too many other characters and subplots were introduced for the story to sustain. There is not just one bad guy here, but several, including Diana, aka Daisy, a nudist female assasin who likes to work in swimming pools.<br /><br />Too much complication for such a slight work. One antagonist -- with one name -- would have been enough. Diana / Daisy was just too much.<br /><br />I'm sure that nudist female assasins who work in swimming pools have their audience, but to me she just seemed terribly strained, silly, and completely unbelievable. I wasn't frightened by her at all; rather, my suspension of disbelief was ruined and I found myself thinking, \\"Wow, Follett is straining too hard here to come up with something new.\\"<br /><br />Toni Gallo, a really cool character, is mated with a geezer old enough to be her father, and that was disappointing.	2005-06-22

Darnton won the Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his reporting of the Solidarity Movement in Poland. Interested readers will forever be grateful to him for that work.<br /><br />Too, I like pop thrillers and I'm interested in paleontology.<br /><br />\\"Neanderthal,\\" though, must be described with a highly technical literary term: \\"dumb.\\" This book is, simply, dumb.<br /><br />I just couldn't believe how dumb this book was. \\"Neanderthal\\" fails on every point, featuring leaden writing, superficial characters that never, ever take on any life at all, and a plot that the author never gets anywhere close to getting off the ground.<br /><br />In fact, this book could be used to teach what not to do when attempting to craft a fantastic thriller. As I was reading it, I kept thinking, \\"Now, this scene / premise / character is completely not believable. How would another artist present this unbelievable material, and make the reader suspend disbelief and believe it?\\"<br /><br />I thought of writers and filmmakers who made me believe that dinosaurs could be brought back to life, that a golden fox lives in a suburban wardrobe, that children can fly.  Darnton doesn't do what these authors do.<br /><br />I didn't believe. I didn't care. I wasn't scared. I didn't feel any compassion for prehistoric life forms in a modern day world.<br /><br />I felt uncomfortable and embarassed.<br /><br />Why did I keep reading? I really like Darnton's writing for the NYT, and I kept holding out hope that someone as talented as he would pull out an amazing ending that would tie up all the loose ends and redeem everything that had gone before.<br /><br />Didn't happen.	2005-06-08

Jayne Ann Krentz, has written a huge number of books ... is it a hundred?<br /><br />After reading three of her works, I have to wonder ... has she written a hundred different books or the same book one hundred times?<br /><br />I picked up \\"Paid Companion\\" by chance at the library; loved it.  Reviewed it here.<br /><br />Then I went out looking for Amanda Quick books; picked up \\"Wicked Widow.\\" It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as much fun as \\"Paid Companion,\\" and it used many of the same materials as found in \\"Paid Companion.\\"<br /><br />I thought, okay, I really enjoyed \\"Paid Companion;\\" let me give this author another try. I did, with \\"Affair.\\"<br /><br />I can't say what I'd think of this book if I had not read the previously mentioned books, but I had, so ... all I could think was, I've met these characters before; I've read these scenes before; I've read this exact same dialogue before.<br /><br />The heroine is a spunky, high-born virgin who has lost her fortune because of nasty male relatives. The hero is unconventional but still very manly behind his glasses. The same intimate acts are performed, and they climax with the same exclamations.<br /><br />There's even the same villain who makes the same appearance in the same costume at the same masquerade ball.<br /><br />I know that genre novels are supposed to minimize surprises in order to maximize readers' comfort, but I find it really strange to encounter a series of men in Regency England who say the exact same thing upon completing intimate relations.<br /><br />In any case, Quick is obviously doing many things very right. She does write sparkling dialogue, she does keep the plot moving along briskly, and she does create heroines a woman can like, admire, and cheer for.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Quick books I've read so far, but given how similar they are, I don't know if I need to read another...although, given how much I enjoyed \\"Paid Companion,\\" if someone here sends me an email saying I have to sample her favorite novel before I give up on Amanda Quick, I promise to do so.if someone here sends me an email saying I have to sample her favorite novel before I give up on Amanda Quick, I promise to do so.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-30
US	22752564	R3S48UVGEYCNSG	0385477090	302329004	The Life of Thomas More	Books	5	17	25	N	N	Intimate Encounter with a Larger-Than-Life Historical Figure	The moment I finished Peter Ackroyd's \\"Life of Thomas More,\\" my strongest impulse was to close it, open it up to the first page again, and start -- immediately -- reading it all over again, word by word, page by page.<br /><br />I hung on every word of this text. I wanted to understand Thomas More.<br /><br />I wanted to understand a man whose misogyny was obvious in his many derogatory statements about women. For example, when asked why he liked short women, he said that it was best to choose the lesser of evils.<br /><br />When a mature man, More married a mere girl and got her pregnant so many times in such rapid succession that she lived only a few short years after marrying him.<br /><br />More married his second wife, as the saying goes, while still in mourning clothes for his first. He mocked that second wife, Dame Alice, publicly. He wrote texts that associated women exclusively with sex and disgusting bodily functions like vomiting and diarrhea.<br /><br />And, yet, More was exceptional for his time in educating his beloved daughter, the one great passion of his life, Margaret More Roper.<br /><br />More persecuted his countrymen who deviated from the Catholic faith, and published vile condemnations of Luther, and eventually, knowingly, and humbly, sacrificed his own life to his own interpretation of that faith.<br /><br />More rose, through obediance, flattery, and dogged labor, from relatively humble circumstances to being Henry the VIII's chancellor, and a wealthy man, and then tossed away his considerable worldly goods and power to die an ignominious death.<br /><br />You want to understand a man who could encompass so many passionate apparent contradictions.<br /><br />And, so, I hung on every word of Ackroyd's detailed and yet economical text.<br /><br />My attention was amply rewarded. Ackroyd marshalls the kind of authentic, telling details of the Medieval life that More lived that can make an era, and its inhabitants, come alive. Even so, Ackroyd is never wordy. When he has said enough, he simply stops.<br /><br />Along the way, Ackroyd brings to light the life and impact of a woman he says has been nearly forgotten: Elizabeth Barton, a seeress and nun in Kent. Barton spoke against Henry VIII's divorce of his wife, Catherine of Aragon.<br /><br />Her voice was considered so important that Henry himself visited her.<br /><br />For her trouble, Barton and her priestly followers were tortured to death.<br /><br />As I read, I could not help but reflect: in our own age of \\"celebrity,\\" we know too many details about non-entities we don't care about at all -- the Britney Spears and Paris Hiltons enjoying their fifteen minutes of fame. We can view film footage of their most intimate moments on the internet; hear their every thought in televised interviews.<br /><br />Thomas More lived five hundred years ago. We can't ask him to reconcile for us his hateful diatribes against women and his love of Margaret, his ant-like accumulation of worldly goods and his sacrifice for his beliefs.<br /><br />The records just don't exist.<br /><br />And, yet ... even though the More in these pages has to remain something of a cypher, even though More, as was the norm in his time, wrote with extreme caution in ambiguous, tradition-bound, unspontaneous and sometimes flowery prose, I felt I had an encounter, through Ackroyd's book, with a remarkable human being. I was in tears throughout the final passages leading up to More's death.<br /><br />A final word: I am a fan of \\"A Man for all Seasons.\\" Again and again, reviewers pit Ackroyd's book against the Robert Bolt play and subsequent movie.<br /><br />One does not necessarily cancel out the other...both the film and this book work, for me, from what I know about More, as explorations of his life and impact, and his famous final choice.<br /><br />I never saw Paul Scofield's More as a Thoreau-like figure, as some reviewers have said; he was not depicted as living in a house in the woods, after all, and he did base his decision on adherence to a greater principle than personal conscience, i.e., the law, just as Ackroyd's More does.<br /><br />So, yes, do see the movie, and do read this book.s, after all, and he did base his decision on adherence to a greater principle than personal conscience, i.e., the law, just as Ackroyd's More does.<br /><br />So, yes, do see the movie, and do read this book.	2005-05-25

Read it. Give it to friends. Require, before anyone talk to you about Nazism, about Polish-Jewish relations - or, for that matter, about heroism or human suffering - that they read it. Demand that lecturers, students and journalists know it before they attempt to speak with authority on World War II. If they aren't familiar with it, acquaint them. You may want to carry a copy for that purpose.<br /><br />Many of us have sat around a dying fire, or an emptying bottle of vodka, while Polish loved ones recounted their WW II experiences. We've wanted others to hear these sagas before being quick to judge. We've used these narratives to inspire ourselves: \\"If he could survive that, I can get through this.\\" Now such stories are available in book format. It's high time. What took us so long?<br /><br />\\"Forgotten Survivors\\" presents twenty-eight, first-person accounts of Poles who lived through WW II. Now-and-then photographs illustrate each account; there are also fifteen Jan Komski drawings of concentration camp scenes. Tellers include former camp inmates, slave laborers, underground fighters, and Zegota members.<br /><br />As much as I appreciate this book, and that is very much, there are aspects of it that either troubled me or will trouble others, or at least deserve comment here. First, of course, there is the title. These stories are powerful, and they are transcendent. They are valuable today, and they will be valuable as long as human beings face life-and-death challenges.<br /><br />The polemical title does not best serve these accounts and their authors. The word \\"forgotten\\" implies that important audiences have ignored Polish suffering. Another way of understanding post-war discourse is to acknowledge that Jews have done an admirable job of broadcasting and canonizing their story, and Polish non-Jews have, for whatever reason, been less successful at this.<br /><br />Our best strategy is to honor our own story, not blame others for honoring theirs. \\"Heroic Polish Survivors,\\" would have honored the narrators in this book, without positioning them as a rebuke in a feud whose importance - unlike the stories themselves - is transitory.<br /><br />\\"Christians\\" is also problematical. Some Poles were neither Jewish nor Christian, and suffered under Nazism; some were openly hostile to organized religion. Many Polish Socialists were not Christian and were heroic in their resistance to Nazism.<br /><br />These Poles do not deserve to be \\"forgotten\\" any more than their Christian fellow nationals do. The term \\"non-Jewish\\" - one Lukas does occasionally use - acknowledges the impact of Nazi racial policy without eliminating the stories of non-religious Poles.<br /><br />Readers concerned with ethnographic technique will be frustrated by Lukas' omission of his transcription method. The accounts do bear many of the hallmarks of oral personal experience narratives, including colloquial language and lacunae where readers expect orienting details.<br /><br />But some editing surely took place; there are none of the pauses or repetitions found in raw transcripts. Too, two separate accounts use the rare words \\"hegira\\" and \\"leggings.\\" One wonders if Lukas didn't insert those words into the accounts while editing.<br /><br />With the exception of Irena Sendler, all narrators emigrated to Canada, England, or the US. An ethnographer will want to know how survivor accounts told by Polish emigres differ from accounts told by survivors who remained in Poland.<br /><br />Most narrators are highly placed, white-collar workers: college professors and engineers, for example. These narrators are not representational of a nation whose wartime population was majority agricultural. I wondered, as I read, have we become so intimidated by negative images of Poles that every Pole who survives WW II must be shown to be a high status, model citizen?<br /><br />In the United States, piety is observed in discussions of the Holocaust, as many Jewish writers have protested. Some readers will be shocked to read Poles who lived through the Holocaust speak of their Jewish neighbors less than reverentially; others may welcome the frank humanity in these accounts. At least two Polish survivors recount being slapped or beaten by Jewish police or capos. One survivor who risked her life to help Jews reports being annoyed by \\"those hands stroking their beards\\" during a tense meeting.<br /><br />\\"Non-Jewish Poles were just as likely as Jews to suffer at the hands of the Nazis,\\" reads the book jacket. Page one of Lukas' introduction implies that Poles as a group and Jews as a group \\"shared\\" - a word he uses twice - equal fates. They did not, and histories of the Nazi era in Poland must state that clearly.<br /><br />It must be stated clearly because it is true, and it must be stated clearly because there have been attempts by the Soviets and by government and popular culture entities in the US to dejudaize the Holocaust. Irena Sendler's account acknowledges the difference in scale: \\"Hitler created hell for all of us in Poland. But the kind of hell he made for the Jews was even greater\\" (166).<br /><br />Like others interested in the Holocaust, I have pored over hundreds of photos of Polish-Jewish victims, both those who perished, and those who survived. I've often thought to myself, \\"He looks Polish; I could never differentiate this person from a Polish non-Jew by their facial features alone.\\"<br /><br />Gazing at the Poles in Lucas's book, I didn't encounter a population completely alien to the Jews in other books; I saw heart-wrenching sameness. One Polish narrator reports that he \\"looked Jewish,\\" and he exploited this in his underground work helping Jews.<br /><br />He's not the only Polish non-Jew in \\"Forgotten Survivors\\" who looks very like the Polish-Jewish portraits of innocence, endurance, and courage in other volumes. Wordlessly, these photos testify: Poles and Jews are not so separate as many would insist.<br /><br />In the end, it is the power of the stories that matter, and these stories are among the most powerful you will ever read. Not only Poles, or students of Nazism, but anyone interested in examining cruelty, heroism, and simple, blind, fate, will find this book rewarding, fascinating, and humbling.is observed in discussions of the Holocaust, as many Jewish writers have protested.

US	22752564	R3GR965IODUS5F	083083267X	903201853	The Gospel Code: Novel Claims About Jesus, Mary Magdalene and Da Vinci	Books	1	11	68	N	N	Mean, Misogynist, Inaccurate	Like millions of other readers, I was delighted by Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" I've never read a book quicker. It was a roller coaster ride: jolting, fast, fun - and no more nor less than that. I'm Catholic, and it never occurred to me that Brown's readers might conclude that Catholics are a bunch of self-flagellating albino hitmen, like one of the novel's main characters.<br /><br />Apparently, though, some fear that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is part of a vast conspiracy to wrest priestly power and prestige from whence it so rightly belongs - in the hands of heterosexual males. Ben Witherington III - could his name - as in \\"withering glance,\\" multiplied by three - be more perfect? - is one of those very frightened heterosexual men.<br /><br />I picked up Mr. Witherington-Three's \\"The Gospel Code\\" hoping for what the cover of the book seems to promise: a fun, pop theological investigation of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"'s more outrageous plot points, including, perhaps, the loopy claim that Harvard has faculty devoted to \\"symbology.\\" (Poor Harvard - yet another potential victim of the vast conspiracy by Da Vinci Code fans imagined by Mr. Witherington-Three - no doubt Harvard has been inundated by freshmen hoping to major in \\"symbology\\" as a way to meet cute French chicks.)<br /><br />What I found between the covers of \\"The Gospel Code\\" was *not* fun. It wasn't theology, except in the scariest sense of that word, a sense best reserved for discussions of the Dark Ages and bloody religious strife. What \\"The Gospel Code\\" offers is a mean, misogynist, and inaccurate ride through one man's paranoia, arrogance and anger.<br /><br />Mr. Witherington-Three opens, not with Christian virtues like compassion or love, but with scorn. On his first page, in his first paragraph, he makes contemptuous, arrogant mockery of a ditsy California woman (page 11); he goes on to finger homosexuals (12).<br /><br />That's right; gay men are somehow part of the vast, world-destroying conspiracy that includes \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and its fans. And women are so ditsy that they don't know the right way to Christ; Mr. Witherington-Three, whose bona fides, listed on the back of the book, include his appearances on \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" must manfully guide this woman for whom he shows no compassion, patience, or respect whatsoever. Jesus wept.<br /><br />Who else is on Mr. Witherington-Three's \\"Da Vinci Code\\" Enemies List? Americans who oppose having the Ten Commandments monument erected in an Alabama court; Episcopalians who voted Gene Robinson their bishop; and Mayberry's own Opie Taylor, aka Ron Howard.<br /><br />Mr. Witherington-Three's problems with women start on the first page of his book, but they don't stop there, as you might expect from a man who establishes his authority to speak on the savior of humanity by citing his relationship to Bill O'Reilly, who was recently involved in a scandal involving charges of sexual harassment in the workplace.<br /><br />Witherington-Three devotes a chapter to Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene supported Jesus' ministry out of her own pocket (Luke 8:1-3). Mary is celebrated as the \\"Apostle to the apostles,\\" since it was she who was the very first person in history to perform the task that all Christians feel honored to perform - she was the first to announce the \\"Good News,\\" or gospel, of the crucified Christ's resurrection from the dead. Finally, Mary Magdalene's encounter with Jesus after his resurrection is one of the most exquisitely intimate, and yet breathtakingly magnificent, passages in the Bible - or all of world literature, for that matter. I can't imagine anyone reading this and not being moved (John:20).<br /><br />No wonder the sixth-century Pope Gregory, with zero biblical evidence, introduced the fiction that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute; misogynists needed to discredit her, and they did, the way that misogynists usually discredit women - by aiming at their gender.<br /><br />What does Witherington-Three title his chapter on Mary Magdalene, the Apostle to the apostles? \\"Something About Mary.\\" That's right - the title of a cheap, gross-out comedy best known for a scene where a woman named Mary is tricked into dressing her hair with an unmentionable male body fluid. How low can you go?<br /><br />Witherington-Three must be playing limbo, because he manages to go even lower. He casts Mary as a sort of first century Ouija Board aficionado (72). Here Witherington-Three manages to discredit Mary Magdalene with a maneuver that tops even the slander that she was a prostitute.<br /><br />Witherington-Three isn't just mean to women; he's mean, period. People who disagree with him show a \\"failure of faith and nerve\\" (148); are \\"illiterate\\" (a word he uses repeatedly), are engaging in \\"sleight of hand\\" (118) to delude an \\"ignorant\\" public into accepting \\"narcissism\\" (19) or \\"gumbo\\" (19).<br /><br />He offers faux psychoanalysis of the scholars who disagree with him, guessing that these scholars failed personal lives have knocked them from the truth as he knows it (94). This is just plain malicious. And it's more - name-calling like this is called \\"ad hominem;\\" that is, an insult to a person, rather than a true analysis of ideas.

How low can you go?  <br /> <br />Witherington-Three must be playing limbo, because he manages to go even lower. He casts Mary as a sort of first century Ouija Board aficionado (72). Here Witherington-Three manages to discredit Mary Magdalene with a maneuver that tops even the slander that she was a prostitute.  <br /> <br />Witherington-Three isn't just mean to women; he's mean, period. People who disagree with him show a \\"failure of faith and nerve\\" (148); are \\"illiterate\\" (a word he uses repeatedly), are engaging in \\"sleight of hand\\" (118) to delude an \\"ignorant\\" public into accepting \\"narcissism\\" (19) or \\"gumbo\\" (19).  <br /> <br />He offers faux psychoanalysis of the scholars who disagree with him, guessing that these scholars failed personal lives have knocked them from the truth as he knows it (94). This is just plain malicious. And it's more - name-calling like this is called \\"ad hominem;\\" that is, an insult to a person, rather than a true analysis of ideas.

I asked myself why I was reading it so quickly.<br /><br />I read this book so quickly, I think, because it fascinated me, of course, but also because it disturbed me and, given how informative the book is, I kept expecting that I'd turn the page and find THE EXPLANATION that would make it all make sense to me, and give me peace of mind.<br /><br />The \\"it\\" I wanted explained, of course, was the absolute evil of Nazism.  The Nazism in this book is not -- for the most part -- the public Nazism of \\"Trimuph of the Will\\" or the notorious Nazism of Auschwitz.<br /><br />It's the Nazism of cookie bakers and apron wearers. It's the Nazism of women breast feeding their children and dreaming of a Judenrein Germany; their hearts aflutter at thoughts of their fuhrer.<br /><br />Koonz has amassed a trove of data, including personal letters, memoirs, and newsclips, that one is unlikely to encounter in other volumes.<br /><br />Inevitably, her book emerges as a social history of Nazism, the Nazism of the hearth, as it were, rather than the headlines.<br /><br />As alien as Nazism is, the reader cannot help but draw parallels to the present moment.<br /><br />Social reformers who oppose any birth control, and who have deep convictions about woman's place being in the home, having as many babies as possible, and quietly and unobtrusively devoting themselves to making life easier for their husbands and sons who serve the state, are not exclusively a thing of the past.<br /><br />This book, in passages, made my skin crawl. It certainly made me think. It did make me cry.  It is a worthy addition to the scholarship on the Nazi era, and an invitation to deep thought about misogynist ideologues' control over women's lives.	2005-02-27

I recommend this book without reservation.  I just wish all scholarly books were as well-written and socially engaged as this one is.<br /><br />Cynthia Eller's work was cut out for her. She had to debunk a very popular myth that has given comfort to thousands of women beaten into the mud by misogyny.<br /><br />Everywhere women turn, they are told that they just aren't as good as men, and, further, that their very status as women makes them frivolous and good for one thing and one thing only: to support and please men, including giving men lots of children.<br /><br />We've been told that women's status is so debased that she can't function fully as a spiritual being. Even God, who is meant to represent peace, justice, and transcendence, cares so much women's anatomy, that God *him*self discriminates against women, and does not want women in his pulpits. Or, so we are told.<br /><br />The Goddess Myth -- the idea that \\"once upon a time\\" all humanity worshipped a female deity and life was bliss -- came along and offered women salvation from misogyny's most pernicious form, the denigration of women in the eyes of God -- a denigration that paves the way for, and supports, everything from battery to rape.<br /><br />Eller has the courage to point out that no matter how good a falsehood makes us feel, it is still a falsehood, and lies have their price.<br /><br />Eller also manifests the grace and sensitivity to speak these difficult truths with care and concern for women like her who are invested in freedom and dignity for women. She points out the flaws in the Goddess theory with expertise, not with arrogance, cruelty, or mockery.<br /><br />Eller's command of the scholarship of a variety of fields -- the classics, folklore, archaeology -- is impressive.  She introduces the information the non-academic reader needs to know to assess evidence, but she never does this with alienating academic jargon.  The average educated reader should have no problem with this quite scholarly text.<br /><br />Eller does the job of debunking the Goddess myth with admirable thoroughness, but she does more. She writes a fascinating book about ancient peoples and their cultures.<br /><br />The final word about the Goddess myth has not yet been spoken. Eller's book, given its combination of thoroughness, accessibility, wit, and decent concern for readers with a variety of belief systems, will continue to be a key contribution to the ongoing conversation.She introduces the information the non-academic reader needs to know to assess evidence, but she never does this with alienating academic jargon.

This book focuses on males, as well.<br /><br />Female stars are given very short shrift. Example: unless I missed it, there is not a single photograph of Greta Garbo in this large, heavy, 960 page book, with photographs on almost every page.<br /><br />Greta Garbo?  Greta Garbo? Not a big enough star?<br /><br />Okay, it's understandable that a 14 year-old male fan who thinks of \\"Star Wars\\" as an example of the Dark Ages of filmmaking would have never heard of Greta Garbo, but when a book christens itself with the pretentious title, \\"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die,\\" the reader is entitled to expect a bit more knowledge.<br /><br />I guess Garbo's sin, in these editors' eyes, is that she was never stabbed to death in a film, or eaten by a giant, slimey monster. (One can almost hear the editors of this book thinking, \\"Man! Cool!\\")<br /><br />Another star completely missing from this book -- Rudolph Valentino.<br /><br />Umm ... do I need to explain this?<br /><br />See, boys, half of the human race consists of women. Women like to watch movies, too. Once upon a time, Hollywood gave women beautiful men to ogle. Valentino was the first male megastar. His funeral was one of the most important events in the twentieth century history of the celebrity.<br /><br />Guess you missed that ... while watching \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" one more time.<br /><br />Readings of the relatively few women-friendly films that are mentioned are hopelessly off-key and uninformed.<br /><br />\\"Broken Blossoms\\" is lauded for its use of oil-coated lenses.<br /><br />Never, in the full page review, is it mentioned that \\"Broken Blossoms\\" is a full-length, mainstream Hollywood movie treatment of domestic violence, and that it contains a scene where the film's female protagonist, played by Lillian Gish, a huge star, is *beaten to death,* on camera, by her father.<br /><br />It is remarkable that an early, silent film was so brave. No mainstream Hollywood film since has treated domestic violence against women with such power and frankness.<br /><br />Even if you didn't care a whit about domestic violence, even if your only concern were for technique, you'd have to mention that Gish won praise for her ability to depict the girl's terror as her father breaks in on her hiding place.<br /><br />The book never utters a word about the film's treatment of domestic violence, or even Gish's legendary handling of it.<br /><br />The book has other flaws. Many of the more recent films listed are pleasant, but are not films that you should worry about dying before seeing. So, breathe easy about a lot of these pleasant but mediocre films.<br /><br />In at least one case, a spoiler -- the ending of a movie whose ending you should not know before seeing the film -- is revealed. There may be spoilers in other comments, as well. I don't know, because, after a while, I stopped reading.

It goes over ancient documents with a fine toothed comb. As such, it will be an easier read for readers familiar with early church history. That warning should not put anyone off from reading the book; one should know what to expect, though. This is *not* pop history -- it's light years from something like \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  It is serious scholarship.<br /><br />Jensen introduces the reader to a world in which women preached, women prophesied, women made important contributions to theology, and, most importantly, believers saw Christ in their women leaders.<br /><br />Step by step, Jensen analyzes how misogynists, in no way representing the teachings of Jesus Christ, carefully denigrated and ultimately erased the very important women in early Christianity.<br /><br />Predictable steps were taken to wipe out the female presence. Women leaders were denounced as prostitutes. They were denounced as seducers. They were denounced as insane. Finally, their names were taken away from them. Ultimately, they were completely erased.<br /><br />Important names -- female names -- that were once well known to early Christians, such as Thecla, Blandina, and Prisca, go unspoken today.<br /><br />Sadly, we are far more familiar with the misogynist theologians who did everything they could to destroy these women's legacies.<br /><br />One step in reclaiming a *complete picture* of early church history and the very important women who played vital roles in passing Christianity down to humankind today is the purchasing, reading, and passing on of this important book.<br /><br />There are, no doubt, Blandinas and Theclas among us today; knowledge of the facts in this book will help them to thrive and to keep Christianity vital.	2005-02-11

It was \\"Paid Companion\\" and I just picked it up from the new book shelf at the public library.<br /><br />I was delighted by it, as I said in my review.<br /><br />I was eager to read more of Amanda Quick, to see if she could, again, provide me with a book that would be easy and fun to read, but that would not insult my intelligence.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a Quick book; there are so many. I picked up \\"Wicked Widow\\" because it mentioned ghosts and haunting, and I expected a fun, scary book.<br /><br />\\"Wicked Widow\\" disappointed me.<br /><br />In \\"Paid Companion\\" I found the lead characters delightfully idiosyncratic, believable, and not at all the types I'd expect in a romance novel. In fact, one reviewer of that book said that the male lead was grumpy and the female lead was annoyingly politically correct.  They were! And that's what I liked about them. They seemed real.<br /><br />In \\"Wicked Widow,\\" though, the leads are stereotypical cut-outs and they never came to life for me. Artemis Hunt is masterful and domineering; Madeline Deveridge is beautiful and captivating.  Sorry, but, ho, hum.<br /><br />Another reviewer here, Jen from Jacksonville, implies that \\"Vanza,\\" the \\"secret society\\" in \\"Wicked Widow\\" is about as secret as a delivery boy. She's right. There's nothing mysterious or alluring about Vanza.<br /><br />Almost every character in the book seems to belong to it, or know all about it. It crops up in every other sentence.  The name \\"Vanza\\" is applied to the silliest things; as Jen says, a guy hiding in a corner is \\"Vanza.\\"  Remember that the next time you play hide and seek -- you are a Vanza master!<br /><br />Memo to Amanda Quick: sometimes, especially when you are talking about a secret society, less *is* more.<br /><br />As for the plot, well, it never grabbed me. I found myself skipping pages to get to the end quicker.<br /><br />I was especially alienated when characters in \\"Wicked Widow\\" said, basically, exactly the same things, and did the same things, as characters in \\"Paid Companion.\\"  The comfort of familiarity is one thing; it's no fun, though, when you are reading what looks like cut and pasted dialogue and scenes from one book to the next.<br /><br />So, I'm still eager to be educated about the romance genre. If there are other books out there like \\"Paid Companion\\" -- fun, with bouncey dialogue -- I'd like to find and read them.

It was so stupid, so hateful, and so without any redeeming features such as humor or eroticism or even just interesting use of language that I often felt that merely to pick it up I should be wearing a haz mat suit.<br /><br />I didn't read it for pleasure. I read it as part of long-term study of images of Polish people in American popular culture. The books contains gems like the following:<br /><br />\\"The ash-blond Polack hair that feel like shimmering gold around her face, the wild wide mouth slashed sensually with scarlet, the slightly parted lips and white teeth just showing beneath their shadows\\" (page 10).<br /><br />And this:<br /><br />\\"The hot Polack blood is still runnin' around inside yuh, and yuh can't change that\\" (page 194).<br /><br />Robbins can't even manage to spell the simplest of Polish words. \\"Fluudjincki,\\" his character's last name, doesn't exist in Polish, or in any other language, for that matter.<br /><br />But to call Harold Robbins' Marja Fluudjincki a character would be like calling a blow-up doll a human being. Robbins moves his pen on the page, not to give life to real people and real issues, although he'd have you believe that.<br /><br />Rather, he wrote of a large breasted (you're reminded on almost every page), long legged, white blond Polack female who is relentlessly tormented by a world full of men who are eager to hurt her, and do. Robbins' creation is molested by a shop keeper, molested by a school chum, raped by her stepfather, screwed over by the criminal justice system, molested by a guard, forced to put on lesbian performances, betrayed by several fiances, her child is kidnapped and threatened . . . no need to continue. You get the idea. She is *not,* though, tied to a train track.<br /><br />Please don't get the idea that this is a sexy book. It very much is not. There are no descriptions of humans engaging in sexual activity. None. The fewest number of words possible are used to inform the reader that Marja is about to be raped again, or has just been raped again. The only activity described in any detail are kisses, and these descriptions are flat and complete in four or five words.<br /><br />Of course, the book offers zero verisimilitude. Robbins' inability to so much as find one believable Polish name for his character is reflective of a complete lack of reality on every page of the book.<br /><br />Robbins repeatedly calls Marja \\"intelligent,\\" or even, redundantly, \\"bright and intelligent\\" (page 10), savvy, and worldly wise beyond her years.  Then, when he wants her, again, to be raped or mistreated or involved in some idiotic, easily cleared up misunderstanding that ruins her life, he gives Marja the IQ of an ashtray.<br /><br />That's right. Though he tells us again and again how \\"bright and intelligent\\" this girl is, he never, in 406 pages of torments, gives her even the most basic IQ necessary to escape from the many torments he throws her way. This \\"character\\" who, in the previous paragraph, had displayed a wisdom of the world that mature adults might envy, appears to have had her entire brain erased, and she becomes the helpless, squirming, all too female female, ripe to be tormented again.<br /><br />When it is convenient for Robbins to wrap up the book with a happy ending, again, he completely rejects any concept of verisimilitude and uses a crow bar to force a completely unbelievable happy ending into a text that, previously, had consisted solely of scenes of the humiliation and abuse of his heroine.<br /><br />That Harold Robbins did very well, financially, writing this garbage speaks volumes. There are millions of people who will pay money to read empty, misogynist accounts of a beautiful \\"woman\\" being raped and tormented on page after page after page.<br /><br />That nothing erotic ever happens in this book also speaks volumes. The erotic thrill Robbins provides and readers get has nothing to do with human pleasure; rather, it has everything to do with images of a helpless, squirming woman humiliated, disempowered, disappointed, and in pain.<br /><br />The pivotal event that spirals young Marja's life into complete catastrophe, and removes her from her lifelines to any decency or hope, and the \\"nice guy\\" who loves her, is her rape and impregnation by her stepfather, an unemployed, lazy Polack drunk. Immediately after being impregnated by this rape, Marja is incarcerated, thus preventing her from terminating the pregnancy. It is this pregnancy, the book lets us know, that turns Marja from a teen tease who will probably settle down and marry her \\"nice guy\\" boyfriend into a full bore whore.<br /><br />This episode, in this book, speaks volumes. For some, removing women from control over their own bodies and their own reproductive capacity is the supreme act of sexual sadism and misogyny.<br /><br />Robbins provides this population with its ultimate sexual fantasy, not a fantasy involving mutual pleasure or life affirming activities, but the control of a woman with too much power, that power being the inappropriate power over men her body gives her.<br /><br />The ultimate control over female power is to deny her autonomy over her own reproductive capacity.

It was that kind of book -- the kind that, when you were a little kid, you couldn't stop reading even though it was well past your bedtime.<br /><br />This isn't deathless literature and no great problems are solved within these pages. So what? It isn't easy creating characters that are sexy and likable and yet utterly believable as real, and situations that are daring and fun and provide a wonderful escape from real life but that still reflect on real life, and dialogue that's inviting but also every bit as smart as what you'd find in literature that gets taken more seriously.<br /><br />I'll bet that there are plenty of \\"great\\" novelists who would give their eyeteeth to be able to do what Amanda Quick can do, and even more who would never admit it but who could definitely learn a thing or two from her.<br /><br />What amazed me most about this book was how real I experienced the main characters, and how much I liked them. I've tried to read other popular genre novels in the past and just couldn't because I could never take the characters seriously; they always come across as such cliches of masculinity or femininity.<br /><br />I really believed \\"Paid Companion\\"'s Arthur and Elenora, though; they reminded me of people I know in real life.<br /><br />And I greatly appreciated Quick's amazingly deft and clever dialogue.<br /><br />I do have a few quibbles with the book, but they are minor, and did not interfere with my enjoyment.<br /><br />I do wish the writing were just a tad richer. While I appreciate a fast read, I like descriptive detail. I wanted to know more about the smells and sights of this book's world.<br /><br />A bit more verisimilitude in terms of language would have been appreciated -- characters often sounded, to me, to be twenty-first century speakers, rather than nineteenth.<br /><br />While I enjoyed them, I did have a few problems with the book's detailed sex scenes. Readers are very familiar with British novels from that era, including those by the Brontes and Austen. Those books do not contain such graphic scenes, and, so, when you read the sex scenes here, you are very much taken out of the nineteenth-century feel of the narrative.<br /><br />Too, there's something to be said for restraint. If a poet remarks on the expanse and the mystery of the night sky, we all can share in that evocation of our own reaction to the night sky. If a poet starts cataloguing constellations, he stops being a poet and becomes an astronomer.<br /><br />If a writer tells me that a character is swept away by a sensation that erases place and time, I know exactly what the writer is talking about. If a writer, as Quick does here, inventories every caress, I feel I've switched from reading a novel to reading a manual.<br /><br />Also, it always, ultimately, disappoints. I really liked these two characters and wanted them to experience everything. After reading these detailed scenes, I couldn't help but think, \\"Oh, so they didn't do this, this, and this?\\" with some disappointment.<br /><br />These are minor quibbles, though. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a virtuoso writer to provide them with a ticket to romance and adventure whose price is no greater than the price of a book.s often sounded, to me, to be twenty-first century speakers, rather than nineteenth.  <br /> <br />While I enjoyed them, I did have a few problems with the book's detailed sex scenes.

If a poet starts cataloguing constellations, he stops being a poet and becomes an astronomer.  <br /> <br />If a writer tells me that a character is swept away by a sensation that erases place and time, I know exactly what the writer is talking about. If a writer, as Quick does here, inventories every caress, I feel I've switched from reading a novel to reading a manual.  <br /> <br />Also, it always, ultimately, disappoints. I really liked these two characters and wanted them to experience everything. After reading these detailed scenes, I couldn't help but think, \\"Oh, so they didn't do this, this, and this?\\" with some disappointment. <br /> <br />These are minor quibbles, though. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a virtuoso writer to provide them with a ticket to romance and adventure whose price is no greater than the price of a book.   <br />	2005-01-06

It's purely by chance that he survived; his family was murdered.<br /><br />You may be thinking, \\"Why would I want to read that?\\"<br /><br />Well, just pick it up and find out.<br /><br />This book was forced on me. I didn't want to read it. Someone else wanted me to read it and gave me a copy. He told me that he regularly buys copies in used book stores and gives them away to others.

Alice Sebold's assessment: \\"If I could eat this novel, I would,\\" graces the front cover.<br /><br />Given that, it may just be the perfect book for you.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book didn't work for me at all, and here I'll report why.<br /><br />It was the great reviews, by the way, that brought me to the book, and caused me to keep reading. I wanted to explore the mystery: why could intelligent people disagree so strongly about the worth of a novel?<br /><br />As you've learned from other reviews, or just from the title, the book records the meetings of a book club devoted to reading all the works of Jane Austen. The club's members are discussed in sequenctial chapters, via significant memories from their pasts.<br /><br />In the final chapters, the previously single people are now either dating or married.<br /><br />Quotes from critical commentary about Austen are scattered throughout the book, and concentrated at the end. So, you get to read assessments of Jane Austen's work by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling and many others.<br /><br />Sounds great. What's not to like?<br /><br />This was some of the most forced, schematic writing I've ever read. Never for one second did I believe that any of the characters were flesh and blood people, or that any of the events described within actually happened, or that they mattered at all.<br /><br />I read works written by college freshmen who have almost no interest in writing. Even these tyros just about always, almost without even trying, wright moments that provide warm, idiosyncratic windows into the human experience that the reader would never access had she not picked up and read just that one homework assignment.<br /><br />Student writers do this with a bit of too much passion, too much truth, idiosyncratic word choice that shakes up your ways of looking at reality. You come away with insight, and a sense of connection, you didn't have before you started reading.<br /><br />I never got that experience while reading \\"The Jane Austen Book Club.\\" Rather than windows opened by passion or spontaneity, I stared at a carefully masoned brick wall.<br /><br />I got the sense that Fowler got this clever idea -- that she'd honor her heroine, Jane Austen, by rigging up some \\"characters\\" who would experience \\"life events\\" that could somehow be used to complement a salute to Austen.<br /><br />One character was sexually molested when she was younger, and another had a psychotic mother, and another had a father who didn't much want to be a father.<br /><br />These flashback scenes are as dead and unbelievable as the characters inhabiting them.  When I read the scene of sexual molestation, I felt no sympathy, no arousal, no interest. I just thought, okay, what point is Fowler trying to make by writing this scene? Like anyone who either is a woman or reads works by women, I'm not unfamiliar with such scenes. There was nothing in Fowler's treatment of this too common theme that worked for me on any level.<br /><br />Given that it didn't work, I was just, coldly, offended by it.<br /><br />It may have come to believable life if later impact of the molestation were allowed to show in that character. But that character, like every other character, was just an interchangeable California middle class WASP who likes to read Austen. There was nothing tellingly distinctive about this character.<br /><br />The scene where a character realizes that his father isn't much of a father was one of the most forced and artificial scenes I've ever read. I didn't believe a moment of it. Why not just slap a label on the character saying, \\"I'm a bad father\\"?<br /><br />Amazingly, these diverse characters who grew up with psychotic mothers or having been sexually molested or with loser fathers end up all being exaclty the same person, basically -- a nice -- emphasis on \\"nice\\" with all the blandness that implies --  middle class California WASP who has plenty of disposable income.  No one is poor, no one is not, at least functionally, a WASP, no one has any distinctive traits that would disturb the nice, neat pattern.<br /><br />Life doesn't work that way.  People who have been through diverse life events sometimes grow up into being diverse people whose diversity, whose vitality, whose unpredictability, would not fit in a wallpaper pattern designed to honor Jane Austen.<br /><br />Years ago a movie came out titled \\"Jane Austen's Mafia.\\"  It was a funny title. I'd like to see someone salute Austen that way -- emulate what was best in her, her insight, her facility for capturing the spirit of her milieu, but include the kind of flesh and blood people who surround us everyday, people who can't -- successfully -- be reduced to unobtrusive elements in a nice, neat little schematic diagram.\\"nice\\" with all the blandness that implies --  middle class California WASP who has plenty of disposable income.

Most Americans do want decent treatment for gay people, reproductive freedom, and economic policies that diminish poverty and increase well being.<br /><br />The Right, Lakoff says, has won more and more votes -- today we have a Republican president, legislature, and, significantly, Supreme Court -- because Republicans have expended extraordinary amounts of money and effort to refine their own language use so that their way of talking about issues dominates national discourse, and voters' ways of thinking.<br /><br />\\"The Right\\" = \\"Republicans\\" = \\"The Religious Right\\" = \\"Reactionaries\\" = \\"Conservatives,\\" for the purposes of this review.<br /><br />Lakoff calls his approach \\"reframing.\\"<br /><br />It can be compared to the business term \\"rebranding.\\" Businesses, and even countries, pay consultants top dollar to \\"rebrand\\" products that have lost appeal. This isn't about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear; it's calling sow's ears \\"porcine silk.\\"<br /><br />Lakoff's own analysis of what constitutes the key difference between a Rightist and a Leftist is a family model. Rightists believe in families with oppressive fathers, Lakoff says, and apply that model to national and international life and policy.<br /><br />Leftists believe in a supportive, egalitarian family model, and apply that model to national and international life and policy.<br /><br />Lakoff offers concrete suggestions on how Leftists should use language. He offers suggestions both for the microcosm -- one-on-one debates about gay marriage, for example -- and for the macrocosm -- big steps that Leftists need to take in the future, developing think tanks, for example.<br /><br />The book is short. You can read it in less than one day.<br /><br />The book is repetitive. Lakoff, rather than going into greater depth, repeats himself in a way that's rather insulting to the reader, and annoying. He repeats because the book contains texts of speeches Lakoff has given at various locations. He repeats his contrasting family models, for example, without adding anything new.<br /><br />The book's biggest problem, though, is one of substance, not style. The book insists on something that is not true; it delivers a false promise to Leftists: the only problem with the Left today is that we aren't \\"framing\\" our ideas correctly.<br /><br />Sorry, George, that's just not true. There are problems of substance with the Left, and until we admit to them  and fix them, specimens like George Bush will be able to exploit our failures and win the White House.<br /><br />Problem one, unaddressed by Lakoff: In his book, Lakoff thanks personnel at Alternet. That's interesting. After presidential election 2004, Alternet ran an article by Lakshmi Chaudhry dividing the world into people who believe in \\"tolerance, justice, and equality\\" and people who believe in God.<br /><br />Lakoff's colleagues at Alternet also host a discussion headlined, \\"Christianity, the Core Problem.\\"<br /><br />These examples, from a plethora of examples, by Lakoff's own colleagues, demonstrate that the Left does, indeed, host elements who intensely hate Christians and Christianity.<br /><br />In a country where most people are Christian ... that isn't gonna win you many votes. Rather, it's going to -- tragically -- drive voters into the camp of a George Bush, whose advisor, Karl Rove, has learned to exploit Christians' fears and hurts.<br /><br />Second, Lakoff does not address the Left's epochal gaffe of relentlessly focusing on race and all but forgetting issues of class. Richard D. Kahlenberg offered a brilliant analysis of this failure in his 1995 New Republic article, \\"Class Not Race,\\" and his later book, \\"The Remedy: Class, Race, and Affirmative Action.\\"<br /><br />Poor Whites feel abandoned by the American Left's leadership. That's because, in signficant ways, they have been abandoned by the American Left's leadership.<br /><br />They are also widely held in contempt by an American Left that often throws around terms like \\"white trash,\\" \\"trailer trash,\\" \\"rednecks,\\" \\"Christian fascists,\\" etc.<br /><br />So, as Lakoff points out, poor whites often vote against their own ecomonic interests. Lakoff is wrong, though, in thinking that they vote against their own self interest just because of problems of style -- problems of language, or \\"framing.\\"<br /><br />When people regard you as a loathsome \\"Christian fascist\\" (a term often used at Air America Radio) \\"redneck,\\" you are not going to vote for the people you associate with those terms.<br /><br />One could go on. In short, Lakoff is looking, and writing, through rose colored glasses. Unless and until Leftists - Democrats - Progressives - However We Are \\"Framing\\" Ourselves Today -- admit to and change the very real elitism and contempt that are a very prominent veins in our bedrock -- we are going to continue to hand elections over to the likes of Karl Rove.

It goes down easily. Martin creates a sustained mood of low level suspense.<br /><br />I cared enough about this book to have been disappointed by the ending, though.<br /><br />I'd still recommend the book, for its powerful and appealing heroine, and its stylish evocation of Victorian-Gothic Romance -- three contrasting historical periods, but one fun literary genre.<br /><br />Warning! This review will hint at the book's ending, but will not spell it out. If you are familiar with Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide,\\" on which \\"Mary Reilly\\" is based, you won't learn anything new.<br /><br />\\"Mary Reilly\\" has one of the most riveting openings I've ever read, if not the most. It's a description of an episode of child abuse.<br /><br />For the first time in my life, I was hooked from the very first line of a novel, and could not put the book down. I had to know what happened to that child -- even though, of course, since the child is the Mary Reilly of the title, I knew that she would survive.<br /><br />Martin doesn't plunge to the depths of child abuse, but she writes of the surface with such power that I had the feeling that I was in the hands of a master.<br /><br />Martin deeply impressed me with the terror and vulnerability of the abused child, as well as that child's resilience and drive to survive, and the twisted sadism of the abuser. All in a very few brief words and pages.<br /><br />But that's just the opening pages.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is made up of Reilly's crush on her \\"Master,\\" Dr. Henry Jekyll. Reilly's history of having been an abused child is mentioned as part of the reason why Mary has this crush; like her master, Mary has a horrible, hidden wound that drives her apart from the rest of society.<br /><br />It's the classic Gothic set-up, enshrined in literature at least since \\"Jane Eyre.\\"  Mary Reilly is a bright, principled, and spunky girl consigned by fate to a lowly life, that of serving her \\"Master.\\"<br /><br />Her Master, of course, is intense, mysterious and unconventionly attractive.<br /><br />Like his spunky young servant, he does not fit into society's pre-ordained classifications.<br /><br />And he pays an inordinate amount of attention to his servant.<br /><br />He doesn't make clumsy or lewd passes at her; rather, he watches her, converses with her, confides in her, conspires with her in a way that breaks social expectations, and expresses frank admiration of her intelligence and spirit.<br /><br />As is traditional in Gothic romance literature, Mary and Master's flirtation consists mostly of muted and aborted conversations. They have to be aborted -- for this upper class doctor and his serving girl to converse is against the rules.<br /><br />Again, if you've read \\"Jane Eyre\\" or the thousand other Gothic romances modeled on it, you've read all this before.<br /><br />If you enjoyed it in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" you'll enjoy it here. This reader certainly did.<br /><br />I did yearn for, and did not encounter, something more, though. This book is more of a novella than a novel; Mary has little to no life outside of her truncated encounters with her Master, and the novel has little to no other plot.  This singleness of narrative strand makes the book a quick and easy read, but also something of a lighter read than I wanted it to be.<br /><br />There is one extra feature here that Martin could have done more with, but she did not. The taboo intimacies between Jekyll and Mary reek of the power abuse of an older, established man of a young and vulnerable woman.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll is obviously arousing expectations in Mary that he will never satisfy.  He uses her, on her day off, to do some truly vile tasks for him.<br /><br />How does Martin feel about this? How does the novel want the reader to feel?<br /><br />Most importantly -- Martin did such a fine job of depicting a believably perceptive, articulate, courageous, spunky, integral creature in Reilly that I never really believed the scenes in which Reilly lets Master walk all over her.  I wanted Reilly to at least acknowledge that she knew that she was being used by someone who would probably only hurt her.<br /><br />Too, Mary was as fetching to me as she was to Dr. Jekyll, and, so, I wanted to spend more time with her, and observe her inhabiting a richer world.<br /><br />At a certain part in the novel it began to drag, for me; I felt that I'd gotten the point of all these hushed, rushed conversations between Mary, usually on her knees, with her skirts tied up, scrubbing something, and her Master, standing Masterfully over her, observing her carefully, complimenting her, finding some excuse to touch her hand, etc.<br /><br />And I wanted to something else to happen.<br /><br />When something else did happen, I was disappointed by that something else. Without revealing the ending, I can say that Mary behaved in a way that went against her every act so far, and that, I felt, betrayed both the spirit of the book, and of the genre.<br /><br />Part of the point of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" a book that this book bases itself on as much as on \\"Dr. Jekyll,\\" is that Jane had so much self-respect that she was not, ultimately, willing to destroy herself to have the man she loved.<br /><br />Again, I'd still recommend this book. I liked 99% of it so much that I've already \\"rescued\\" it by inventing an alternative ending to it, one in which the final Mary we see is more like the Mary of the rest of the book.believably perceptive, articulate, courageous, spunky, integral creature in Reilly that I never really believed the scenes in which Reilly lets Master walk all over her.

There are two reasons.<br /><br />You should read it because it is a classic of Western Civilization, and you should read it because it articulates, in an historically important and artistically excellent way, the insistence of one lowly born female on being a full human being.<br /><br />When this book was written the words \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\\" had already made history -- for men.<br /><br />We still await the world where women are men's equals.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" has the courage to say, in relentlessly feminine language -- Jane never has to resort to a karate kick to make her point -- that women have just as much value as men. Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.<br /><br />I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being.

I was told not to use photographs or even drawings in class because Nepali villagers, who haven't seen many or even any photographs, might not know how to visually decode them. (FTR: I did use visual aids, and my students did learn to decode them.)<br /><br />The average modern American is very different. We are so inundated by images that we can walk by an exquisite Ansel Adams print or a map of horror like Picasso's \\"Guernica\\" and not see or feel anything.<br /><br />My American students have to be taught, not how to to decode photographs, but how to get in touch with their own response to photographs -- to learn that images of violence or sexual exploitation do have an impact, an impact they've been taught to ignore.<br /><br />When a photography book, from its front cover to its last page, grabs me and doesn't let me go, when I can feel a photography book reach into my visual cortex and move around the furniture, I know that that photography book is something special.<br /><br />\\"Bound for Glory\\" did just that.<br /><br />E. H. Gombrich, in his book \\"Art and Illusion,\\" talks about \\"schemata,\\" or visual formulas that limit how artists can represent the world, and, thus, how consumers of art can view the world, in any given era.<br /><br />As I gazed at \\"Bound for Glory's\\" images, I could feel my \\"schemata\\" being set in motion as if they had been wallflowers at a dance, and this book got those \\"schemata\\" up and dancing around, assuming positions they'd never assumed before.<br /><br />The 175 photos span an era from the late 1930's to the early 1940's. I did not live through that era, but my parents did, and I have spent many an hour gazing at their black and white photos of that era.<br /><br />Too, I am a classic movie fan, so I've spent hours watching and rewatching films like \\"It Happened One Night\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" that depict the same world this book depicts: that of small town American life.<br /><br />When I first opened this book of COLOR photographs from the 1930s and 1940s, I thought, \\"This is WRONG.\\"<br /><br />Now, I know that that reaction is factually incorrect. I know that people in the thirties and forties had pink, beige, and brown skin, blue or brown eyes, red dresses. But because I've been so trained by the family photos and classic films of that era to expect black and white, the color of these photographs completely messed with my head.<br /><br />The people looked too real. My contact with them felt too intimate.<br /><br />That effect has not, as yet, worn off. I've gone through the book several times and the rich, lovely, saturated colors still shock me. The chipped red nails of the homesteader wife. Her clashing yellow flowered apron and blue flowered dress.  Her blond hair. Wow.<br /><br />Color is not the only reason to appreciate this book. The photographs are well-lit and well composed. They are amazingly clear. You see strands of hair, shoe straps, bruises, facial expressions, clearly.  Really, it's as if you bought a ticket on a time machine and walked into a church service, or a country fair, from decades ago.<br /><br />You see that very poor Americans from that era had not yet become obese. A crowd of wonderfully dressed African American women gather outside a church; each is as slim and strong looking as an athlete. In a gaggle of white homesteader kids, not one is overweight.<br /><br />You see that very poor Americans from that era put much effort into grooming. A white homesteader man wears a white shirt that is quite filthy, but he has tucked it into his pants; he wears a hat at a jaunty angle. An African American boy in overalls also wears a hat; his shirt is buttoned up properly. Someone put a great deal of care into his appearance, even though the clothes he wears are evidently old.<br /><br />You see the creeping \\"uglification\\"of America in billboards and industrial sites.<br /><br />You see resignation and quiet disgust on the face of one girlie-show dancer, and goofy eagerness on the face of another.  You see how we permed our hair sixty years ago.<br /><br />I love this book.

Not with this book. Its excellence shut out the world and placed me firmly in its world.<br /><br />I reread whole passages, just to savor them.<br /><br />This book is a delight; it is also good for you in the very best way imaginable.<br /><br />Our cultural pendulum has swung too far; we have abandoned, or demonized, many of the old WASP, New England values that made John Adams great. Values like hard work, dedication, delayed gratification, community, home, family.<br /><br />Now is a good time to again familiarize ourselves with these values, via this biography of a man who made them come to magnificent life.<br /><br />If you haven't rewarded yourself by buying and reading this book yet, what are you waiting for? It really is as good as everyone says.	2004-11-16

She did give us the salient facts, she does present them in a brisk, humorous and pithy way, and she does put solid support behind everything she says.<br /><br />In other words, it's not Molly Ivins' fault.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not too late to read this book, and, along with other books by folks like Richard Clarke, Joseph Wilson, and Paul O'Neill / Ron Suskind, I recommend that you do. Especially if you live in a red state. As the evangelical pastors say, it's never too late to repent, no matter how much damage you've done.	2004-11-08
US	22752564	R7C6V96WU2AU	0316093831	892605059	Leaving a Doll's House: A Memoir	Books	4	67	79	N	N	Frank, Poignant	Claire Bloom's \\"Leaving a Doll's House\\" is poignant in its honesty, but a bit underwritten. The first time I reached for my highlighter pen was on page 104, where Bloom describes a distraught Vivien Leigh.<br /><br />Leigh, of course, was the incomparable beauty who portrayed Scarlett O'hara in \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"  Leigh's marriage was unsteady; she suffered from mental illness. Leigh kept her emotions in check, but one night Bloom entered Leigh's dressing room and found her in tears.  \\"Vivien in tears was not like anyone I knew; no red nose, sniffles...she simply sat at her table, in her beautiful scarlet [how appropriate] costume; diamond tears rolled down her cheeks, her beauty undiminished, her make-up untouched.\\" What an image.<br /><br />Page 149 includes a similarly brief, and pointedly telling, anecdote. Bloom's husband, the author Philip Roth, insists that a skunk has anti-Semitic feelings toward him.  This anecdote goes a long way towards explaining Roth's new book, \\"The Plot Against America.\\"<br /><br />For the most part, though, the book is frank, and underwritten. For example, Bloom's father was a feckless businessman and gambler who abandoned Bloom, her mother, and her brother. Years later, when she became a successful actress, Bloom's father reappeared, backstage in her dressing room, with a new, rich wife in tow. Bloom, by her own account, was pointedly cold and humiliating to him. Three days later, he died. \\"I believed,\\" Bloom writes, \\"that it had been my callous behavior that had killed him\\" (79). Bloom does not pause after this remarkable confession; only one sentence is offered as denouement, \\"I picked up and went on with my life.\\"<br /><br />Bloom played an essential role in a superlative film, \\"The Haunting.\\" This film is unsurpassed in its genre; its psychological and sociological undercurrents raise it far above most horror films. Though made in 1963, in black and white, and since remade, it regularly makes top ten lists for \\"the scariest movie ever made.\\" Bloom never mentions it here.<br /><br />Too, Bloom partnered some of the biggest names among twentieth century actors: Richard Burton, Yul Brynner, Rod Steiger, Anthony Quinn, Laurence Olivier. If the reader had never seen a Burton film, I'm not sure he would get an adequate impression of Burton from this book.<br /><br />Bloom's Burton has intense green eyes; she quotes a critic who says, beautifully, that his voice is so powerful \\"he carries his own cathedral with him\\" (50). But this reader never understood why Bloom risked the pain she reports feeling being his lover while he lived with, and loved, his first wife, Sybil Burton.<br /><br />Bloom's brief fling with Brynner is enlivened by a late night visit to a Paris nightclub where Brynner, who mythologized his ethnic and professional roots, was adored, and sang with, the Gypsies he said raised him. The night was capped in Russian fashion, Bloom reports; drinking glasses were thrown against the wall.<br /><br />Pages 195-220 contain, without comment, Bloom's diary entries from a particularly rocky time in her marriage to Roth. This is the best, rawest, most detailed writing in the book.<br /><br />As others report, Philip Roth is depicted here -- believably -- as a demented and sadistic man. He is also clearly depicted as an object of genuine pathos. It must be hard to be Roth's wife; it must also be hard to be Roth. Without ever using the term, Bloom creates a vivid portrayal of Roth as a kind of idiot savant with Borderline Personality Disorder.<br /><br />Reading of Roth's self-induced wounds of greed -- he demanded that Bloom pay him huge sums of money as compensation for the time he spent with her -- paranoia, and sheer unhappiness is like reading of a patient tormented by self-induced skin rashes. It's simply hard to watch, and you can't help but say a prayer for his speedy recovery.<br /><br />\\"Leaving a Doll's House\\" is an easy read, and poignant in its honesty. It offers insights into Claire Bloom that will cause me to view her performances, and other women I meet, in a more expansive, and more compassionate, light.sty.

US	22752564	R1JVBTV5QKYXWV	0618509283	528177434	The Plot Against America: A Novel	Books	3	29	68	N	N	An Alternative History, or a Lie?	Question for fans who champion Philip Roth's \\"Plot against America\\" as a brilliant, moral analysis of anti-Semitism: How would you review a Palestinian \\"alterative history\\" that depicts Israelis feeding Palestinians into gas chambers? How would you review an \\"alternative history\\" by a real aid to former President Bill Clinton who depicts Clinton raping her, though he did not? A point blank question: what is the difference between an \\"alternative history,\\" and a \\"lie\\"?<br /><br />\\"Don't invent; just remember:\\" Roth announced as his dictum when he was writing \\"Plot.\\" Thus Roth implicates himself as a case of self-induced False Memory Syndrome. This notorious condition, created by overzealous therapists, resulted in the jailing of innocent adults who had never harmed any child. *Real* child abuse -- like real anti-Semitism -- must be fought. It is exactly because anti-Semitism is so heinous that false charges of anti-Semitism are themselves so heinous.<br /><br />Some individuals are so self-important, so divorced from common standards of decency, and so ravenous for unearned pity that they announce that they have been victimized when they have not. Philip Roth insists on imagining himself, Philip Roth, as the main character, the primary innocent victim, in the history of anti-Semitism in America. Like the woman who cries rape when she's never been touched, Roth does not care whom he slanders with his phony charge. He also does not care how much of the spotlight he hogs from real victims.<br /><br />Slander Roth does. Yes, there was anti-Semitism in America in the interwar period. There was murderous hostility to largely Catholic Eastern and Southern Europeans, Asians, and blacks as well. But statistics speak volumes. So do the rows of white crosses above places like Normandy. Over sixteen million Americans fought fascism in WW II. Almost three hundred thousand Americans died. In \\"Plot,\\" these lives were never lived, nor were they ever sacrificed.<br /><br />Roth further lies about history by stating in so many words that Jews, and Jews alone, are the only imaginable victims. In fact, one would not have to imagine anything to write a genuine history of organized terror and mass murder in the case of twentieth century African American history. Too, not only Jews, as Roth insists here, were victimized by the Nazis; Gypsies, Homosexuals, Poles, Soviets, Jehovah's Witnesses, trade unionists, etc, were also targeted.<br /><br />Roth's further twisting of facts abounds on every page. Pacifists and others who did not want to enter WW II had reasons other than anti-Semitism for their hesitation. Millions, including Americans, had just fought in WW I, and, by many assessments, had thereby accomplished nothing. Lindbergh and others who resisted America's entry into the war often criticized the British \\"race\\" as much as they criticized Jews, because Brits wanted America in the war. Walter Winchell, Roth's hero, was a vicious homophobe who destroyed careers of those who would not play along with him.<br /><br />Hog the spotlight from real victims Roth also does. As the book makes its splashy debut, a real genocide is taking place in Darfur. If Roth were the least bit moral, he could use his fame to draw attention to the tens of thousands already dead in Darfur, and the millions slated to die.<br /><br />As literature, the book is empty. Roth's opening descriptions of Newark are pedestrian. That's to be expected. Readers will rush these early passages to reach the \\"money shots,\\" the titillating, \\"true\\" depictions of rabid Kentucky goyim burning Jews alive.<br /><br />Roth's distortions are not random. They are part of a struggle to redefine Nazism. Authors like James Carroll, in his \\"Constantine's Sword,\\" have been working to define Nazism as an expression of Christianity. For this definition to make sense, many historical facts must disappear, for example, that Nazis persecuted Christian populations, and that Nazis defined their own movementas an expression of ancient paganism and modern science.<br /><br />In this profoundly immoral view, all Christians are essentially anti-Semites, and all Jews are essentially victims. This view can never explain genocides like that by Muslims against fellow Muslims in Darfur, and so, that genocide is best ignored. Much else must be ignored, including the millions of Americans who fought against fascism. One can see how \\"Plot\\" services this worldview.<br /><br />Roth has lived, and now lives, a comfortable life, rich with rewards that any human might envy. He has written two books, \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" and \\"Goodbye Columbus,\\" that earned him hatred from Jews who denounced him as a self-hating Jew. With \\"Plot,\\" Roth is trying to have his cake and eat it too. Don't swallow it.<br /><br />Read Romeo Dallaire's \\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\" to understand genocide in our own day. Read Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" to discover how one real survivor dealt with his real Holocaust experience. Read more recent books by survivors like Bernat Rosner and Betty Schimmel. And then read Roth.

She spoke of Metalious, and \\"Peyton Place,\\" with respect. Metalious, she said, had made a serious effort to address ethnicity, class, and incest.  Since I'm a writer myself who has addressed these same issues, I decided that one day, I had to read \\"Peyton Place.\\"<br /><br />I picked up a copy and fell in love with the first page. It is a description of Indian Summer. This description is lush and beautiful and displays a love and sympathy for the natural world that can't be faked. I put the book down, resolving more firmly to read it someday.<br /><br />We're having a beautiful autumn, and so I went back and picked up \\"Peyton Place,\\" still a bit intimidated, expecting to find the trashy, titillating romance novel I expected it to be. I never encountered that book.<br /><br />I didn't encounter a deathless classic that moved me deeply, either. What I did encounter was a very well written book that depicts a small New England town and its small-time characters with intimacy, familiarity, and unfailingly consistent, well-crafted prose.<br /><br />A few features stood out. First, Metalious' familiar, unflinching, loving tone. Metalious' writerly touch is like the touch of a nurse. She is on the clock; she can't go too slow. She's done this before; she knows what she is doing. She touches spots you normally hide. Metalious knows the citizens of Peyton Place inside and out, how they present themselves in public, and what they think in their private thoughts. Some writers, this familiar with their characters, learn to hate them, and teach their readers to hate them, as well.<br /><br />Not Metalious. Even as she describes men and women doing the most venal things imaginable, she conveys her patient love for these characters. She seems to love them just because they are hers. This love, and sense of possession and belonging, comes out most strongly in the book's climactic trial, when Peyton Place is overtly pardoned for its sins, and loved for its community.<br /><br />Two, Metalious's style impressed me greatly. This book would be ideal for adult readers with poor literacy skills. Metalious never gives the impression of being less than intelligent and penetrating, and yet she uses very consistent short sentences, short vignettes,  and easy vocabulary.<br /><br />Here, this straightforward style is not off-putting, any more than it is in a fairy tale. One gets the sense that there is more here than meets the eye. These brief vignettes, or portraits of small town types, reminded me of \\"Spoon River Anthology.\\" Third, Metalious escapes into nature.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />For example, as in an urban legend, one very brief moment of sexual thrill - - a boy gets a glimpse of a girl's naked breast - - is followed immediately by his accidental death.<br /><br />Some complaints with the book. I don't think it will stay with me; none of the characters moved me that much. At times the piling of one gossipy tale on top of another got to be a bit much. Did the high Protestant minister really have to have a secret, illicit craving for Papism?<br /><br />I would have preferred that the author stuck with one thread a bit longer and allowed the characters to blossom a bit more under her touch. And, the book is misogynist; in a series of merciless characterizations, Dr. Swain and Tom Makris are simply too heroically male to be real, and the female characters tend to be silly nellies that just need a good slap and a good lay.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />All in all, though, I do recommend this book. It's an easy read, and it really is not what pop culture might lead you to expect. It's better.conveys her patient love for these characters. She seems to love them just because they are hers.

US	22752564	ROTO3OM2XGBFI	0312034296	513993002	The Song of Bernadette (Religious Miracle Fiction Series)	Books	5	68	74	N	N	I recommend this book to *you.*	My title of this review, \\"I recommend this book to *you*\\" may seem rather bold; after all, I don't know who may or may not come along and read this review.<br /><br />But I stand by that title. Whoever you are, gentle reader, I recommend this book to you. It is one of those universal classics that powerfully, skillfully, and with thoroughgoing integrity, addresses a truly universal phenomenon: the encounter of mortal, corporeal, limited human beings with the numinous.<br /><br />That's something we all share, no matter our language or religion. One day we are walking along, leading our workaday lives, and -- something happens. Something that just does not fit in what we can conceive of as real. We have a dream, we see, however fleetingly, a ghost, we know something we should not have known.<br /><br />How do we respond? What is the proper response?<br /><br />A related question: Human suffering. Why? What is God *thinking*? Or, isn't human suffering proof that there is no God?<br /><br />Franz Werfel's \\"Song of Bernadette\\" takes up these questions, questions that every sentient creature must ponder at least once in his or her lifetime. And Werfel does a bang-up job.<br /><br />Werfel himself was no stranger to either phenomenon. He knew suffering, and he knew the numinous. He had previously written of the Armenian genocide. He was a Jew escaping from Hitler when he, inspired by a trip to Lourdes in his escape, undertook to complete a vow and write something that would honor what he experienced there.<br /><br />I was wary of this book. Mindful of the Jennifer Jones - Vincent Price movie (what a combo), I expected a spongy, pious, icky book. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />From the start, the reader realizes that no matter what else he is, Werfel was an excellent writer. Born in Prague, he was a peer of Franz Kafka and had an established reputation before he began \\"Song,\\" having been voted the most popular author in the German language in 1926, and having won the Grillparzer Prize, the Schiller Prize, and the Czechoslovakian State Prize, among others.<br /><br />One of Werfel's great gifts is that he doesn't try to sell you anything that you don't want to buy. He uses his literary skill to recreate a humble peasant's life for you, to drag you into a grim dwelling where an ordinary peasant girl is doing her chores, and coughing asthmatically. Believe me; this is not a child you feel any temptation to worship. She could be anyone, anyone. From these particulars, Werfel creates a universal tale.<br /><br />Now, the tough part. Werfel, of course, is writing about GOD. That topic that makes people get crazy with each other. And he's writing about a miracle, an event that, by its definition, defies human belief.<br /><br />I'll be frank. I'm a lifelong Catholic. And *I* find Bernadette Soubirous' story hard to believe. Were I sick, I would not seek healing at Lourdes; I'd go to a medical doctor.<br /><br />This is where Werfel's skill as a writer really shines. He does not even attempt to describe the miracles in a believable way. Rather, he describes the *reactions* of observers in a way that I found completely believable. I believe that average people, when confronted with the numinous, would react exactly as the characters in Werfel's book are described as reacting.<br /><br />Werfel never converted to Catholicism. After reading his masterful book, I, a Catholic, have more questions than answers about what really happened - and about what really continues to happen - at Lourdes. Indeed, those not at all Catholic, but interested in the power of the mind to heal the body, have included Lourdes on their research itineraries.<br /><br />It was Werfel who first gave me pause about Bernadette, and about Lourdes. Without having read his book, I think I would have dismissed Bernadette, had I given her any thought at all, as a hoaxer, or as someone with some mental disability. Isn't that how we usually respond when confronted with the numinous, but at a distance? Werfel provides us with portraits of people who respond exactly that way, and others who have to handle the numinous when confronted with it at first hand. The contrasts are wonderfully drawn, as are the occasional conversions.<br /><br />As Werfel so wonderfully says, \\"for those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation is possible.\\"<br /><br />We all, at some moment or another, wrestle with ourselves to discover on what side of that line we take our stand. At such moments, we could do worse than pick up Werfel's \\"Song of Bernadette.\\"nd when confronted with the numinous, but at a distance?

By this point, most of us have read at least one of these documents, if not more.<br /><br /> For example, the entirety of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be read on the Internet. Quotes from the Gospel of Thomas are frequently heard in Christian circles, and have been for about twenty years. For surprise and inspiration, reading or even just rereading apocryphal writings in which early Christian women describe their acceptance of Christianity as radically empowering acts would raise more hairs on your arm than reading &quot;Beyond Belief.&quot;<br /><br /> Pagels writes about debates over whether Jesus was merely human or divine. Again, nothing new here. There have been debates among Christians on this issue for a long time. Anyone with a front door, for example, has probably had at least one brush with the Jehovah's Witnesses. Pagels argues that the Gospel of John is unique among the gospels in proclaiming the divinity of Jesus. Jehovah's Witnesses often use a verse from that very gospel to refute that divinity. In addition to the JW's, there are less known groups, like the Arians, and Unitarians.<br /><br /> Pagels posits two opposing viewpoints, one from John, that locates divinity exclusively in Jesus, and one in Thomas, that locates divinity in all. Hmm . . . isn't it in the canonical Matthew that Jesus says, in so many words, &quot;You are the light of the world&quot; and &quot;the kingdom of God is within you&quot;? Was it not Paul who wrote, &quot;The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit&quot;?<br /><br /> And were not the Gnostics, Thomas included, terrifically elitist, arguing that true enlightenment was possible for only a select few? &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; fails to mention this.<br /><br /> In other words, for this reader, there was not much new here. Too, as a book reviewer, I have to say that Pagels' prose did not move or inspire me. I did not come across a single sentence I had to jot down or underline, a rare experience for me in reading. I heard Pagels interviewed on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and her delivery struck me as extraordinarily halting. Just so with her writing. This is nothing if not a quiet book.<br /><br /> Too, Pagels speaks of the death of her child from a rare disease in a way that just did not work for this reader. The child's death is mentioned in passing, and isn't well-related to the book's wider point. One wonders why it appears in this book at all.<br /><br /> What was newsworthy here, for this reader, is what was never said.<br /><br /> Pagels positions herself as on the side of tolerance, and the Catholic Church as on the side of intolerance. To support this, she discusses the creation of a New Testament canon, one in which John is accepted as a worthy gospel, and the Gospel of Thomas is rejected as heretical. Pagels also discusses Constantine's conversion and the church's subsequent move from a persecuted sect to a state authority.<br /><br /> The moral of this story: Catholicism, or any organized Christian religion, is intolerant, and, the early church, which lacked a canon, and state power, was more tolerant, and better.<br /><br /> Pagels critiques others, who have a position, for being intolerant . . . because they don't share *her* position.<br /><br /> Can we say, &quot;Irony&quot;?<br /><br /> In fact, Pagels' terminal flaw is a terminal flaw as yet unaddressed by all the voices arguing for &quot;tolerance.&quot; (It should be stated that &quot;tolerance&quot; is a wonderful word, which speaks of a glorious virtue, that has been ill-used, if not prostituted, in recent years, so much so that it begins to look tawdry.)<br /><br /> To say, &quot;My position is good, and all who do not share my position are intolerant,&quot; is, in itself, to be intolerant.<br /><br /> Had Pagels' addressed that little glitch in her argument, and the argument of others' in the &quot;tolerance&quot; camp, *that* would have been something new, indeed.<br /><br /> Instead, some recent events demonstrated for us vividly the flaw in the &quot;tolerance&quot; position. Mel Gibson made a movie called &quot;The Passion&quot; that unleashed a firestorm of intolerance - no quotes necessary this time, as we are talking about the real thing here - that is truly unprecedented. Scholars and pundits argued that the film would cause riots.<br /><br /> Elaine Pagels spoke out against &quot;The Passion&quot; in The New Yorker, which was utterly intolerant of the movie.<br /><br /> It's hard to talk about that kind of intolerance without resorting to Orwellian language. He'd have something to say about all ideas being worthy of tolerance, but some ideas being more worthy of tolerance than others, I suspect.<br /><br /> Too, Pagels' quoting of anti-Jewish material from early Christian writing is, simply, intellectually, a cheap shot. Contemporaneous Jewish writing contains an equal amount of venom for and condemnation of Christians. Anti-Jewish quotes, alone, don't explain anti-Semitism, Pagels and comrades like James Carroll notwithstanding.-used, if not prostituted, in recent years, so much so that it begins to look tawdry.)  <br />  <br /> To say, &quot;My position is good, and all who do not share my position are intolerant,&quot; is, in itself, to be intolerant. <br />  <br /> Had Pagels' addressed that little glitch in her argument, and the argument of others' in the &quot;tolerance&quot; camp, *that* would have been something new, indeed. <br />  <br /> Instead, some recent events demonstrated for us vividly the flaw in the &quot;tolerance&quot; position.

I laugh so hard when reading this I double over.<br />This humor is not for everyone -- it is for people who, like Franken, are both intellectuals and political junkies.<br />On the down side, I do have trouble with the title. It's funny, but ... it's rude and mean. I don't have a solution here. I don't know how to create humor that never hurts anyone's feelings, and I don't know the best way to respond to hatemongers like Rush Limbaugh.<br />If nothing else, the title of this book, which has become a classic, got us thinking and talking about the Right's muddying of public debate and its abandonment of civil discourse.<br />Too, at times I do find Franken's ability to be impressed by his own intelligence and high-power connections a bit hard to take, but ... I forgive him for that, he is such a valuable resource.	2004-07-17

Its foundation is a love of America and a desire to better the human condition and live up to the promises of our Founding Fathers and Mothers. Its method is rigorous research, applied tactically and courageously, combined with humor.<br />I'm a stickler for civil discourse. I reject ad hominem commentary and obscene language.<br />Yet Franken gets away with both and is very funny to boot.<br />He says things about Ann Coulter that I suspect many of us have been thinking since first seeing her on TV, but haven't wanted to say, out of courtesy's sake. Franken says these things in a way that is so funny you are laughing too hard to monitor your laughter to make sure it is polite.<br />In his own defense, he points out that his targets, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, etc, have made ad hominem commentary their stock in trade. Franken reports on Limbaugh referring to the teenage Chelsea Clinton as the &quot;White House dog,&quot; for example, and Ann Coulter naming a list of ugly Democratic women. After Franken exposes the venom, the distortions, and the mean-spirited sneakiness of his opponents, you see the logic behind his own exasperated and yet precise attacks.<br />Too, Franken points out the simple, basic lies that these same folks have promulgated as facts. And he has had the courage to confront his opponents in person.<br />&quot;Facts are stubborn things,&quot; as John Adams said. Franken has done considerable research to use facts to expose his opponents as basing their positions on sand.<br />And yet, for all its genuine erudition, its core of compassionate and patriotic outrage -- this is a very, very funny book. This is the kind of book that is dangerous to read in a public place. You can't help but laugh out loud and draw attention to yourself.<br />This book aroused in me a great admiration for Al Franken, and a feeling that if liberals want to regain power in America, they might do well to learn from his humor, his armory of facts, and his considerable courage.power in America, they might do well to learn from his humor, his armory of facts, and his considerable courage.	2004-07-17

In intimate and vivid detail, in accessible language, Finefrock takes the reader so thoroughly into her day that the reader begins to feel as if he were living in Nepal, rising at five, walking uphill for hours on an empty stomach, overwhelmed by natural beauty, intestinal parasites, serendipitous companions, and the occasional surly high-caste man.<br />In a day of body-shattering labor, rice is transplanted during monsoon. Finefrock travels to a conference; en route, she must share her crowded tea-shop sleeping quarters with six Brahmin men. Stepping over them in the night to relieve herself would ruin their caste status and her reputation. Another night, she sleeps with an entire family whose baby, mistaking her for his mother, demands her (...). The baby's father, to this day, chuckles over that anecdote; Finefrock does not. Finefrock's students, living, as they do, miles from roads, electricity, running water, use common items to construct toys, including an \\"electrified\\" letter, really a prank, that has Finefrock jumping in fright, and then urging the kids to play the same prank on an unsuspecting, elderly neighbor.<br />Finefrock ponders the big questions: \\"What am I doing here?\\" and the smaller ones: \\"Do water buffaloes always chew clockwise?\\" She informs her neighbors about ideas like family planning; they inform her about hospitality. She aches over long trails, while reading of those who have gone before: the author of \\"Seven Years in Tibet,\\" she is saddened to learn, came to be fluent in Tibetan while walking to Lhasa. She hopes her walks will not be *that* long. She prays never to become blase about Nepal's natural beauty, from a paradise flycatcher that, overhead, appears to be a large white fish swimming in a tree, to the ever-awesome Himalaya. At times her prose reaches the sublime, as when she records of Nepal's heavily deforested slopes, \\"The mountains cry a landslide of tears.\\"<br />Finefrock's book closes with three stunning bits. First, there are excerpts from recent news accounts describing the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The battle between the Maoists and government troops has shattered Nepal's status as a \\"Zone of Peace\\" and broken many hearts that had hoped that Nepal could continue being the dreamed-of Shangri-La it was when they first encountered it.<br />If \\"Mountains\\" has one weakness, it is this: Finefrock hints at the tensions that would explode in mass bloodshed a few years after her departure, but does not bring them to the reader's attention in a detailed way. One wonders if, perhaps, Finefrock had succumbed, however slightly, to the \\"happy savage\\" syndrome. I say \\"however slightly\\" because, otherwise, Finefrock is sharp enough an observer to record encounters not just with hospitable, kind, enthusiastic Nepalis, but also some who are very much *not* happy savages, but who are money-grubbing and rude. It's important to note that Finefrock does suggest the tensions that plagued even a pre-insurgency Nepal. While Brahmins, who monopolize the best land, kibbutz during the crucial rice transplanting, for example, it is Magars from the hills who arrive to do the backbreaking labor, all for five rupees a day (.35 cents) and flatbread. Too, one can only guess that the presence of foreigners like Finefrock, even dressed, as she dressed, in a sari and walking the trails rather than riding the jeeps, and speaking Nepali, also contributed to the crack in Nepal's peaceful facade.<br />The book closes with two startling essays. They are by students who had known Finefrock in Nepal and have since become students and/or professionals in the West. They inform the reader that the Nepal that Finefrock inhabited is not just far away in place, but also in time. Since Finefrock's departure, Nepal has entered the modern world, with telephones, electricity, and roads in her once-isolated world.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you've thought of doing something like this but have hesitated, reading this book will be like having the experience without risking the intestinal parasites.far away in place, but also in time.

We hoped to find in it a worthy depiction of what we value in Catholicism, in spite of its failings.<br />On July 1, the NYT published an article detailing Tony Hendra's daughter's account of her being subject to incest.<br />Outsiders can't know if Jessica Hendra is telling the truth. I can say that the details provided in the article, including corroboration by Jessica's mother and Tony's ex-wife, by therapists who treated Jessica, by Jessica's husband and by friends of Jessica who have known her for years, struck me as compelling.<br />On the other hand, Tony Hendra's protest struck me as not only not compelling, it struck me as suggesting that the story might be true. For example, Hendra referred to his *adult* daughter as \\"my beautiful little daughter\\" who \\"has a pathology.\\"<br />Hendra's current wife said that Jessica's claims were \\"a ploy to grab publicity.\\"<br />Surely, Jessica could have made these claims public at any time, and given that her father is a famous satirist, she could have become famous in the past. She made the claims public now, she said, because her father has written a memoir about being a good person, a good Catholic, a good spiritual person. *That* is what agonizes her. He never addressed what he did to her, though she confronted him.<br />Her words, from the NYT article. Hendra's spiritual memoir, she wrote, is<br />&lt;&lt;... being seen as completely confessional, totally honest, the whole story,'' Ms. Hendra said. ''It's not the whole story. By not saying anything, I felt I was being complicit in it. This book is an erasing of what happened to me. I want people to understand these things don't go away.''>><br />Too, if she merely wanted to be famous, she could have taken any number of other routes to fame on her father's coattails. Many daughters have capitalized on their father's fame -- from Natalie Cole to Jane Fonda. It is not necessary to make a claim of incest to become famous.<br />Finally, even if she were merely making these claims to be famous, what does it say about Hendra's grasp of spirituality that he raised a daughter who would make such a heinous claim falsely, and what does it say about his grasp of spirituality that he would so virulently denounce her?<br />When Cardinal Bernardin was falsely accused of similar abuse, he did not vilify his accuser. Following Christ's dictum, \\"Resist not evil,\\" Bernardin merely let the investigation proceed and let it makes the facts known, facts that ultimately exculpated him.<br />As a woman, as a human being, and as a practicing Catholic, I despair at this story; I despair so very profoundly because its misogyny and its blindness all feel so very familiar to me.<br />For years I have seen Catholics use Catholic ritual, costume, and drama to depict Catholicism as the ur source of good in the world, even as Catholicism preached and practiced a misogyny and a love of power that made the erasure of women's lives and pain so inconsequential as to be unworthy of note.<br />In Hendra's book, covering forty years of his life, he gives scant mention to his wife and children. They are, by his own admission, footnotes, props, for the important drama, the drama that centers on Tony Hendra. His imprimatur, his validation of worth, is that he has a relationship with a Catholic priest, another man.  What role do his wife and children play in the central dramas of his life, either his career, or his spirituality?<br />A clue can be found in the NYT article. His first wife, Judith, said that Hendra had told her that he had his daughter, Jessica, engage in sexual activity with him in the household shower.<br />Judith did nothing, she said, though she was \\"horrified\\" and \\"ashamed\\" because she was so afraid of Mr. Hendra.<br />(...) The man who created that household has now written a best seller that talks about how to reach spiritual enlightenment through Catholicism and through the intervention of a Catholic priest.  And  dismisses the wreckage of his family, his wife, his daughter.<br />Well, they are all female, after all, and, in a misogynist world view, one tragically upheld by the Catholic hierarchy, unworthy of his concern.is daughter, Jessica, engage in sexual activity with him in the household shower. <br />Judith did nothing, she said, though she was \\"horrified\\" and \\"ashamed\\" because she was so afraid of Mr. Hendra.<br />(...)

The four leads, Ash, Lamott, Mitchell, and Bailey, remained, for page after tedious, self-indulgent page, nothing more than cyphers on a page, and painfully obvious writerly exercises. I could see the \\"[wo]man behind the curtain,\\" Byatt, much more clearly than I could see any of her fictional characters.<br />Had Byatt been consciously working to push the reader away from the life and individuality of her characters, she could not have done a more thorough job of it.<br />This is rare for me. I am so moved by Disney's \\"Pinocchio\\" that I can't watch it -- I can't stand to see a cartoon character suffer!<br />But the characters of \\"Possession\\" forever remained a collection of typeface letters to me, Byatt's efforts at writing, rather than real people.<br />Characters never develop their own voices. One character speaks more or less like any other. A departion from this pattern, an American professor, is caricatured as using a lot of obscenities and being very hostile. She is fun, but very obvious. She sticks out like a sore thumb.<br />One exceptional character achieves life -- Beatrice Neff, a very minor, disliked, and irritating character, is vividly enough drawn that she did feel real to me.<br />\\"Possession\\" is shamefully BULBOUS. Its episodes and shifts in narrator and time strain and sag and twist and droop in really ugly ways. The novel never takes on the taut, gracious contours of a work of art.<br />Other writers have been able to produce sleek works that, like this one, consist wholly or in part of fabricated communications -- Bel Kaufman's \\"Up the Down Staircase\\" comes to mind. Byatt does not do what Kaufman achieved there.<br />The book, as its title and subtitle suggest, is meant to be about really hot stuff: human passion. And yet, for this reader, it never stirred one iota of passion, one moment when I felt that something true was being said about love or sex or men or women or how they relate to each other. I never felt a moment's tension for the fate of any of the lovers, or their works. I just did not care.<br />I kept wondering if maybe the book's real audience are the hard-core anglophiles who think that if anything has a British accent it is superior and worthy.<br />The book truly is in love with Britannia.<br />Also, great fans of ornament, of, simply, *adjectives,* will adore this book.<br />The adjectives are the fancy kind: \\"ivory,\\" \\"shining,\\" \\"glimmering,\\" \\"crimson\\" -- you get the idea.<br />The items being described are all fancy, too: dragons, feathers, fairy queens, limpid pools.<br />With all the gilt and faux ivory, the unconvincing dragons and lifeless fabricated folklore, reading \\"Possession\\" is like being in a kitschy gift store in late December.

US	22752564	R1Y5EGZQZO8MO6	0684823411	853290256	Lord Will Gather Me In: My Journey to Jewish Orthodoxy	Books	4	14	18	N	N	Some Flaws; Many Precious Moments	I first became aware of David Klinghoffer when I saw articles by him on the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson's movie \\"The Passion.\\" I appreciated his comments and wanted to read more by him. So, I picked up this book.<br />I have mixed feelings about it. At times I got the strong sense that someone had informed the author at some point in his life that he was brighter than other people and that he didn't need to do the same intellectual work that others do. Further, I got the impression that, thanks to that perception, the author is a bit contemptuous of other people and a bit lax in presenting the facts.<br />I don't mean to make ad hominem attacks on this author, but if my perception is correct, it is unfortunate. Klinghoffer writes about Judaism and Christianity and troubled interactions between the two faiths. This interface is of world importance. One must be very circumspect when addressing these issues. For this reader, Klinghoffer was not adequately circumspect.<br />An example of intellectual laxity: Klinghoffer claims that Paul converted to Christianity from Judaism because he did not want to, or could not, follow Torah. This statement alone renders every reported fact in Klinghoffer's entire book suspect.<br />People who know nothing else about Paul often know that he converted as a result of one of the most famous conversions experiences in history. Paul's dramatic conversion is so famous that \\"road to Damascus\\" has become a phrase to describe a conversion experience of any kind, Christian or non-Christian, indeed, religious or secular.<br />Too, Klinghoffer implies that Catholics sing \\"Deutschland Uber Alles\\" as part of the mass. I'm a lifelong Catholic and I've never heard the German national anthem sung during mass. There is a Christian hymn that uses the same music, but I've never heard that in mass, either. Klinghoffer never makes any of this clear, which is unfortunate, given one incorrect current trend that equates Christianity with Nazism.<br />Klinghoffer is no kinder, in some ways, to Judaism. His description of a synagogue bar mitzvah in Los Angeles where rude Jews speak at football-stadium volume while a rabbi inveighs against evil \\"Goyim\\" creates, however inadvertently, a negative stereotype of Jews. This may be an accurate description of a real service, but it was not presented with enough context to render this passage comprehensible as anything other than an anti-Semitic caricature.<br />An example of the author's condescension is the misogynist way he discusses his Catholic girlfriend, Maria. Three times when talking about her, he says, \\"Women cry so easily.\\" When Maria creates something artistic, the author describes her as \\"adorable\\" in a very condescending way.<br />Also, as a person of faith who struggles with the misogyny and homophobia in my own faith tradition, I found Klinghoffer's attempts to explain away the Levitcal association of menstruating women with abomination not at all convincing, and his association of homosexual love with death to be truly alienating.<br />In short, Klinghoffer works too hard to make God -- or our human understandings of God -- rational. In general, this reader was uncomfortable with Klinghoffer's tendency to set Judaism and Christianity against each other as if they were horses competing in a race. Certainly, Klinghoffer himself set these two traditions in competition with each other when he was deciding, like the nuns in \\"Sound of Music\\" how to solve the problem of Maria, his Catholic lover, but the stance of competition is not the happiest one for Judaism and Christianity to be assuming vis a vis each other right now. Rather, the two faiths had better learn to coexist.<br />On the other hand, this book offers truly precious moments that make up for the book's failings. At times the author loses his arrogance, his lax hold on important facts, and his contempt, and he writes of his own experiences from his own heart, and it is at those moments that this bookis most valuable. When the author is most himself, and most vulnerable, he is the most powerful as a writer.<br />When the author, early on in the book, compares Judaism's appeal to him with the appeal a sunken ship holds for an explorer, his writing reaches its poetic height. When the author confesses that Catholic Maria married someone else and has children, and, yet, when he sees her, his former love for her seems to hover in the air as an almost palpable presence, when the author admits his yearning for his roots, biological or spiritual (the author was an adoptee), the sensible reader will not be able to avoid being moved, being taught, and being changed.<br />Too, at other times, Klinghoffer does a good job of presenting key facts. He is entirely correct in telling Maria that Jesus did not fit every model for a Messiah as presenting in Jewish scripture.<br />This reader hopes that Klinghoffer will continue to write in a confessional, memoirist vein, which was his strength here. This reader further hopes that Klinghoffer will sharpen his fact checking skills, and consider the impact of episodes like his description of his visit to the LA synagogue, and place such episodes in some illuminating context, if he does use them. This reader also hopes that Klinghoffer will lead with what he revealed here as his greatest strength -- reporting with courage and honesty his own unique experiences.his book is most valuable.

There's much to admire. For example, he takes a progressive attitude towards issues of gender, including the status of women and of homosexuals, and he takes this stance as an Orthodox Jew. As a church-going Catholic who actively supports Gay Rights, I admire Boyarin both for his faith and for his support of gender non-conforming people.<br />In a world of intolerant, rigid, and destrucitve so-called \\"fundamentalists\\" and \\"fundamentalisms\\" insisting that there is ONLY ONE way to read a text or a tradition, including scripture and the history of Judaism and/or Christianity, insisting that the ONE WAY to read the Judeo-Christian tradition is to read it as male supremacist and oppressive, I greatly appreciate that Boyarin says, as he says so clearly in his introduction to this work and in another book, \\"Unheroic Conduct,\\" that there are many ways to read texts and traditions.<br />For example, as Boyarin says here, if one uses as one's starting point in Paul the verse, \\"In Christ there is no male; there is no female; there is no slave nor free man\\" one will read Paul very differently than others who see, in Paul, an oppressor who upheld slavery and the oppression of women.<br />I also admire Boyarin's wide-ranging store of knowledge, his humanity, his enthusiasm, and his humor.<br />And he takes on issues that this reader enjoys reading about.<br />On the other hand, and it is a big other hand, Boyarin is a self-indulgent writer who has lived a sheltered, purely academic life. He writes as, one imagines, he would talk when talking to someone who shares his interests, his references, his enthusiasms, as closely as would a doppleganger or an imaginary best friend.<br />Boyarin just about never shows any consideration for any audience who might not be an exact duplicate of him.<br />So, the reader has to slog through paragraphs or pages not knowing what Boyarin is talking about, not because the ideas at play are all that complex -- they never really are -- but because neither Boyarin nor his editors have taken the time to frame what Boyarin is saying in a way that will be readily understood by someone who is not sharing the exact same brainpan as Boyarin himself.<br />Oh, how I wish there were an edited version of Boyarin's books, in which references that need not be obscure are presented in a way so that someone who has not lunched with the exact same clique of grad students that Boyarin has lunched with would be able to grasp what Boyarin is saying, without reaching for outside references -- which, sadly, I always have to do when reading Boyarin -- or slogging through his endless, and, yes, self-indulgent footnotes.<br />This is a positive review. Boyarin is, again, well educated, enthusiastic, and he takes a humanist approach from a tradition, the Judeo-Christian tradition, that too often has been used as an excuse to oppress others. His work is a marvelous antidote to intolerant \\"fundamentalisms\\" and \\"fundamentalists.\\"<br />But, Daniel, if you would -- please be a bit more mindful of your audience.

One conclusion is that the Shroud is a diabolical, intricate fake. It was designed by some Medieval forger who could predict how scholars, in a variety of fields, centuries hence, would seek authenticity, using features no Medieval audience would require or even accept - for example, Jesus' nudity and nail marks through the wrists, rather than the hands.<br />The other conclusion is that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. *That* conclusion is so stunning, so truly terrifying in its implications, that the intelligent person, while intrigued and delighted by the Shroud's mysterious features, struggles to find conclusive evidence that the Shroud cannot possibly be what it very much appears to be.<br />In any case, the evidence to support either conclusion is finite. If you read this book, or Mark Antonacci's book, or any number of other publications on the Shroud, you will be going over similar intellectual terrain. You will read of neutron flux, the sacking of Constantinople, the Knights Templar, and the peculiarities of Jerusalem's flora. As an artist, Wilson pays more attention to artist Isabel Piczek's theories than other authors have -- and that is a very good thing -- but, otherwise, Shroud fans will have read about much of this material before.<br />What set Ian Wilson's book apart for me was the author's style. Amidst the hard evidence, Wilson was willing to give us his own subjective response to seeing the Shroud for the first time. Wilson was willing to quote others' astounded reactions as well. Wilson wrote of scholars whose theories he does not accept with wit and graciousness. He was also willing to share with those of us outside Shroud politics the ins and outs of the Shroud world's gossip and infighting.<br />For these reasons of style, humanity, humility, and humor, Wilson's is my favorite Shroud book so far. I like it that he doesn't allow the pressure to prove the Shroud's value via hard science to silence his humanity. Wilson strikes me as a wonderful chap; reading his book, I wished I could be discussing the Shroud with him in person in a pub somewhere in the soggy English countryside.e response to seeing the Shroud for the first time.

Mark Antonacci provides an exhaustive introduction to several shroud theories, from several different scientific fields. There are, for example, the Mandylion theory from international art history, the VP-8 3 D theory, from high tech imaging, the paint theory, from microscopic examination, the pollen theory, from botany ...<br />Antonacci writes well, but there are places where his prose could have benefited from a careful copy editor. Compared, though, to the often execrable writing found in many best selling books today, Antonacci's prose is just fine. There are a couple of places where he makes minor errors of fact, for example, when he refers to Veronica's veil as one of the fifteen Stations of the Cross. There are fourteen Stations of the Cross.<br />The insurmountable problem is, of course, that shroud scholarship is very much alive. Visit Barrie Schwortz's excellent website [...] and you will read active, living exchanges between high powered scholars who are convinced that diametrically opposed points of view are correct. Are there traces of paint on the shroud, or aren't there? One can find opposite opinions, firmly attested, by equally prominent scholars.<br />In short, the mystery of the shroud *is not* something that will be solved for you by this book. You will merely be introduced to a mystery that has gripped minds for over one hundred years, since it was first revealed, through the first photographs of the shroud, that what the naked eye sees when viewing the shroud is a blurred shadow compared with what the camera reveals in its *negative* images of the shroud.<br />What does all this mean? I came to Antonacci's book knowing that no definitive answer has yet been produced, and that scholars in hard sciences better qualified than I to assess evidence are convinced of the fantastic premise that the shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus.<br />Even though I know that the issue is not settled, Antonacci's book was a real page turner for me. I read late into the night, hoping that I would hit upon that one bit of evidence that conclusively proved either that the shroud is a fantastic forgery, or an even more fantastic artifact.<br />That final, conclusive bit of evidence has yet to surface, but that did not interfere with my considerable enjoyment of this book. I do recommend it, to skeptics and believers alike.of Jesus. <br />Even though I know that the issue is not settled, Antonacci's book was a real page turner for me.

Scientists, academics, journalists and politicians in the US, during this era, decided that Eastern and Southern Europeans were different and lesser peoples than those of Northwestern Europe, whom they labeled \\"Nordics.\\"<br />This racism was so powerful that these Eastern and Southern Europeans, along with East Asians, became the only immigrants in American history whose numbers were limited by the US Congress on the basis of their racial inferiority.<br />It is more than ironic, it is utterly fascinating, that the most desirable man in America at this time, a man whose very name has come to signify romance, and whose film role, \\"Sheik,\\" has become the name for a brand of prophylactics, was an Italian immigrant, once so poor he had to sleep outdoors, and his consorts were Natacha Rambova, a WASP who took a Slavic name, and, then, Pola Negri, a Polish-born actress.<br />Emily W. Leider does an excellent job of presenting the popular press reaction to the racial and sexual threat Valentino posed.  I wish she had had presented more and wider background on the racist literature of the day, but readers can find this literature elsewhere, in, for example, Higham's \\"Stranger in the Land.\\"<br />I also came to this book as a feminist. Valentino may have been unique. He was a star of the first order whose career was built on his ability to arouse women. Valentino had other talents - he was a dancer, and, as his performance in \\"The Eagle\\" shows, a fine comic actor. He was no bimbo; Leider notes that copies of Proust, in the original French, were among his possessions. He could converse in several languages.<br />But his career was ultimately about his ability to please women erotically. That cost him. The press hounded him. Men criticized him. Panic can be sensed in some reactions to him. Would his career, his willingness to wear such a feminine item of apparel as a *wristwatch,* cause \\"matriarchy\\" to break out? This panic is, again, fascinating.<br />We are missing the point if we consider ourselves to be more advanced than those in Valentino's day. No star has taken up the mantel that was dropped when Valentino met his untimely death. And attractive male stars today have to work to prove themselves to men by, for example, fighting and damaging their prettiness, as Brad Pitt did in \\"Fight Club.\\"<br />I came to this book for an in-depth discussion of issues of race, class, gender and eroticism, issues that have, by no means, been settled in our own day.  I got that discussion, and so much more. I found Leider's style to be distant and careful. She dots her i's and crosses her t's; her sources are cited and she is careful not to cross the line into intense psychoanalyzing, or into fervent or even just highly detailed critiques of the Valentino filmography.<br />But I was unexpectedly moved by the Valentino I met in these pages. Leider quotes H.L. Mencken's account of his encounter with Valentino, shortly before the star's death. I came away from Leider's book feeling similarly to how Mencken felt after his real life encounter with Valentino. I felt as if I had crossed paths with a tender, boyish, charismatic, uniquely gifted/cursed, somewhat lost young man, whom I would never forget, and whom I couldn't help but, however distantly, cherishing.e sensed in some reactions to him.
