Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince starts out with an ominous scene that, throughout the book, we must wonder about, as to whether it will lead to the certainties that will finally settle our doubts. J.K. Rowling does well at setting up situations that foster doubts, even as the problems in the book get more awful, and things we may or may not have expected pan out, whether to the vindication of our theories or not. A maddening book in that respect, the book is a feast of growing dread, a horror of lost youth, a sobering tome of feats, and unrelentingly pays bittersweet joy and sadness to its readers. J.K. Rowling trusts her readers to understand.	2005-08-22

The Midwich Cukoos starts out in a mysterious and ominous way, but these events pan out and the book goes stagnant. I've read half of this book, but I lost interest at the quarter pole in it. It shows promise for the future halfway in; I might finish it. Wyndham has a good reputation for a writer. But Midwich Cukoos is written with the detached, analytical rationalization that H.P. Lovecraft did much better. Don't get me wrong-- Midwich Cukoos starts out GREAT: On a night when the narrators have, by chance alone, left Midwich, a mysterious force has rendered the town SILENT, COLD, and WITHOUT POWER. Everyone is powerless to enter the town and find out what happened, for reasons you'll just have to read and discover. This really worked for me. I was stoked, and desperate to read more. It enabled me to read half of the book in little over an hour. At that point, the first of Midwich's evil children is born. And the nature of that evil is revealed, and quickly. But it is disappointing that the book has so little physical action or threats at this point. Where's the fun in that?	2005-05-31

This is the fourth book in the Wheel of Time series that I have read back-to-back in trying to catch up. I feel it is written in the most muscular style of any of the books in this series since The Great Hunt, moving briskly without compromising the established approach of heavy world development. I liked that about this one. In this book, also, I was thrilled to see Mr. Jordan surprise me in an unexpected way: he cracked the stubborn facade of one of his leading men, and it seemed to have given the character pause, for growth. In what is probably one of the most suspenseful, imaginative and well-choreographed trials of peril for anyone in the series, we see one of the Seafolk's ships sink under fire, taking Nynaeve down with it. What happens then? Read the book. Few passive scenes exist in it, although the book has its courtly intrigues and road-trips. In earlier books, scenes like this might have cooled the reader's heels. It ain't so, here. I enjoyed this book, and I think it gives hope to Robert Jordan's faithful readers.	2005-05-17

The plot is thinly developed, and the relationships are not focused or emotionally acute enough to make me care. I read this after I finished Shadow Rising, with the relationship of Perrin and the Bashere woman fresh in mind. (I think that she was from house Bashere-- the Hunter of the Horn, whom he loves.) This one, despite the sparkling relationship between Aviendha and Rand, saw these highlights come few and far between. The best thing in the book for me was probably the rise of Matt as leader of the Red Hand, a re-instated military group from the Age of Legends. Matt does not use Age-Of-Legends warriors or anything to man his army. He just runs it. Also, this book relates some great tragedies, and course changes. The book gets three stars because Jordan's prose is still actually pretty lucid, and he seems to have a point to make. The thing is, these points are explained with little vigor.	2004-10-11

In this book a highly successful lawyer falls into deep depression over a death in the family. To fight this crisis he decides to do something brash: answer an ad he sees in the newspaper: to buy a magic kingdom for one million dollars. To the shock of his partners, he leaves his law practice. Then, having bought the kingdom, he discovers it has...quirks, which he has not expected. As king, he must rid the kingdom of a dark paladin and other evils. This book was good, with a spiritually resonant ending. I enjoyed it, and I will read its sequels. But it is not the refreshing, zealous sort of work he took delight in writing in Sword of Shannara and Elfstones of Shannara. This is sometimes a sad book, sometimes speckled with humor. Overall, it comes across as a mysterious adventure. I award it three stars instead of four because of occasionally strained humor that did not make me laugh, and a few thematically heavy turns that initially dragged me.	2004-06-23

An Army of Angels is beautifully written, infused with light, faith and a conveyable sense of how this righteous, teenaged peasant girl uplifted the hope of nations. Of how she, despite the dogged stubbornness that moved her and her army beyond Orleans to the Siege of Paris in the face of sensible political opposition, was able to keep the faith in what she felt was right to do. Though her angels warned against it, as she had already fulfilled their task for her. Though doing so led her to be captured, tried and executed.	2004-06-21

The Shadow Rising takes place on at least four major fronts, three of which I'll mention here: Tear, Rhuidean, and The Two Rivers. In Tear, we see Rand Al'Thor taking command of an Aiel army and fighting off Trollocs and trying to avoid falling in with Lanfear, who apparently is in love with him, or what she can use him for, in a well-described and choreographed close quarters battle. Matt Cauthon is as irrascible as ever about Aes Sedai meddlings, and soon follows Rand, Egwene and Moiraine Sedai to Rhuidean, a sacred and restricted city of the Aiel that is located deep in the waste. Meanwhile, Egwene Al'Vere has been stretching her skills at entering the dreamworld of Tel'Aranrhiod and has accompanied Rand into the waste not to explore Rhuidean as he has, but to gain dreamsleep instruction with the Aiel Wise Ones. In a really meaty section, Perrin Aybara travels to The Two Rivers to give himself up to the Whitecloaks. Faile follows him. What happens there is some of the most vivid storytelling yet in the Wheel of Time, with tremendous character and relationship development, and invention at showing us how the Wheel can warp events around the Ta'veren. An outstanding book, which I may well follow up soon by reading Jordan's book 5.	2004-06-15
US	52554393	R1T5QIKNQBSSTY	0670030643	89209679	The Eyre Affair	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A pleasing foray into a different world...	The Eyre Affair is really a book about a world somewhat like ours, but vastly removed from it due to the widespread love of plays, fiction and poems, which achieve such focus as we have afforded the movies today, and the commonplace supernatural creatures who live there, and the peculiar technologies that people develop. The people in Ffordes world are so obsessed with the written word that a Special Ops division has been set up in England to investigate literary crimes. The Eyre Affair revolves around a series of these crimes, which culminates in the kidnapping of Jane Eyre right out of Charlotte Bronte's novel, a feat afforded by a strange technology, misused by a megacorporation and the government. This book is an eyepopper, a fresh and unusual fantasy. Although it has several subplots that occasionally left me considering how things tied together, I kept reading. This is a great one for a bibliophile, but most could read this and understand the literary references Fforde expounds on. As a thriller, it had me turning pages all the way to the end.	2004-03-11

The first thing I thought when I read this book was that Tony Ruggiero has a very keen idea of how the special ops military really works, and that he uses what he knows about that to great effect in this novel. Through his descriptive prose, he really knows how to put us in Kosovo. It helps us to know how the Kosovars feel about occupying forces; we feel the effects of dust and weather. And we learn about Balkan legends, in this case about vampires. Tony has a great ability to choreograph special military operations, even to the extent that in this novel, they feel \\"real\\". We see the soldiers' diplomatic- and combat-related concerns. Maybe it's the realism that helps us to see TEAM OF DARKNESS as a different vampire novel; one that, despite its supernatural elements, enthralls us with sumptuous detail that never supplants action.	2004-02-03

The best thing I can say about Stephen King is this: in his best books, he writes like a guy you've known all your life, who flops back in your lazy boy with a drink as he tells his story. He speaks directly, and plain, and it's clear he means what he says. J.K. Rowling does the same, but secretively, and whispery. ON WRITING suggests that Stephen's run-in with a van has not ended his ability to write well. This book was finished after the accident. It has conviction, and I loved it. (While I personally consider his next novel, Dreamcatcher, one of his weaker books, it also had fine moments.) In ON WRITING, the first part tells us some of his isolated memories, which he believes have helped him become a writer. He avoids calling it a biography. Some interesting points discussed are Stephen's term as a newsletter writer (as a boy); his period as a manual laborer; teaching, and selling CARRIE. In the second part he gives advise to writers. He approaches this like a regular guy. For example, he compares his writer's rules to a \\"toolbox\\" that you should keep with you. Otherwise you'll get frustrated and give up on your project. I find it interesting that Stephen finds characters \\"more important\\" than plot. Some writers I've read and spoken with say that characters ARE plot. It shows how a writer develops their own methods, and that they'll use whatever works for them.	2004-01-23

Wrath of God is one of those books where heroes out of history are brought together through science fiction to fight an encroaching evil. It is an end of the world novel set in the  west of a future United States. In a twist of fate, a Mongol Khan has returned with his army to seize control of the land. Through the use of a time travel contrivance, Amelia Earhart, Stonewall Jackson, George S. Patton, and others are assembled to fight the horde. The land itself is important. A girl hikes into the mountains in one case to detonate a bomb in some caverns causing a cataclysm to help the resistance effort. Gleason's book does have an old woman similar to the lady in Stephen King's The Stand. But where the Stand builds suspense over a long time, Wrath of God is written to move fast. That, I believe, is its biggest failing. Post-apocalyptic novels usually steamroll the reader, building tension behind heavy-handed prose. It's a technique that works well, which Gleason seems not to have noticed. Still, I read this four hundred pager, didn't get tired, and didn't feel that badly cheated. It's written at the surface level without much underlying psychology to govern the characters, relying instead on the awesome group Gleason has assembled. It's like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen done better than the movie, the Alamo, or the Marvel Secret Wars comics. I'll recommend this if you like the premise, and accept the idea of the tale moving faster than usual fare.	2004-01-20

I read this 870 page monster off and on for two weeks in order to finish it. I am an adult with less time to read than I used to have, so two weeks is a really fast read for me. I did not get tired at all in witnessing Harry's anger, a sustained, startling difference from the earlier books. That J.K Rowling has explained her reasons for using that trait, that Harry is reacting to his plight as a hormonally ravaged teenager, makes sense. If you want to sympathize with him as a human. Other new features are the way Mrs. Rowling keeps us guessing at the identity of the next person to die. I won't give any details as to how she does that, except that these tactics are rendered cleverly. I am amazed by certain reactions of the Dursleys in this book. And I like the love story here, but I fear Mrs. Rowling may moderate this due to revelations made in Order of the Phoenix. Harry's spiritual outlook will change forever. This is my second favorite of all the Harry Potter books after The Prisoner of Azkaban. Azkaban's timeslip aspect was done so well that it will be hard to beat, but Order of the Phoenix may overtake the top spot in due time-- the flowing prose is better developed than the earliest books, in a surprisingly less cumbersome, wooden way to read, and very expressive.	2003-12-23

The story proceeds well, but it was a bit hard to follow, as it is a tale of political intrigue in a fantasy setting, and I have found intrigue hard to follow whether it comes from John Le Carre or Robert Ludlum. The religious and mythological back-story necessary to a reader's delineation of the political groups here ought to be bookmarked for easy reference. It comes in the form of a story told to a young thief who accompanies the knights. Be sure to do that. It will help you to keep things straight. Also, read the prologue about the Troll who enchants the stone carefully. This also doesn't come up again, but it ties into the political struggle and you need to understand it. THRONE gets three stars for its natural, even style, unobtrusive, which never gets rushed as it does sometimes in the Belgariad, and for its good characters and decent plotting.	2003-12-04

Friedman's coldfire trilogy is composed of Black Sun Rising, When True Night Falls, and Crown of Shadows. As a series, it is excellent. In Black Sun Rising, Ms. Friedman introduces us to a truly original world, one so important in its mysterious ability to manipulate and feed on a person's fears that it seems like a character. There is enough high, magical weirdness to her world to fill the novel, and Friedman builds her story around that in Black Sun Rising. For instance, I remember the magical wards she placed on homes to thwart danger. Also, an evil forest exists where it is rumoured that an ancient sorcerer lives by the name of Gerald Tarrant. In his youth, he committed a terrible crime to achieve an exalted status, and now he has become a sort of fear-consuming vampiric demon. Friedman knew the potential of this material, and she took advantage of it. As good as Black Sun Rising is, I liked When True Night Falls even better. At over six hundred pages, it posed no difficulty for me to read half in one sitting. My car was in the shop, and I was in an alien world.	2003-06-20

In reading this book, we see the enthusiasm of Willis Conover at fifteen years old, as he starts the Science Fiction Correspondence Club with some penpal fans. When interest in that dwindles, he and another boy from the group decide to refocus their efforts onto producing a good fan magazine. Conover starts by soliciting material from several science fiction and fantasy writers in order to fill the early issues of it, the Science Fantasy Correspondent. Little does he know that his letters to H.P. Lovecraft are taken very seriously by the great writer. As this becomes more apparent, we see Willis cautious at first, then more and more open and exuberant. Lovecraft at Last is an in depth look at their correspondence, with letters arranged chronologically so we can see the flow of their conversations. Within its pages, we get a fascinating view of a relationship between two unlikely friends.	2003-06-11

Tom Deitz became one of my favorite fantasy writers when I read this book, and he has only amplified that standing with each of his successive novels. Since then I've never failed to buy his new books as they come out, and I've read six of the novels in this series, which I'll call the Sullivan's Cove novels. In this one, his very first book, Deitz introduces us to the high schooler David Sullivan and his friends, as stalwart a band of adventurers as there ever was. David, a fantasy and medievalist fan, stumbles across a rare book called The Secret Commonwealth. He buys it, and when he takes it home, he accidentally casts a spell he finds inside. The resulting ability he receives is to see the Golden Roads of Faerie that crisscross the Blue Ridge Mountains. This leads him to Tir-Nan-Og, the land of the ancient faerie gods of Ireland. A frustrating geas of secrecy placed upon him by these warriors creates dramatic tension in a tale where his little brother is swapped for a Changeling, and in which he adventures both within the borders of our world, and beyond.	2003-04-08

It would be impossible to give you much of an outline of this book. The thing is too big. I can, however, say a few things. Firstly, I enjoyed it and read it quickly. Jordan's style is driven and flows well, allowing for comfort in the reading. Secondly, this is book one of what is currently ten books in an unfinished, continuing epic. All the books are gigantic. In this book, a boy named Rand Al'Thor and his friends begin a saga involving a Tolkienesque dark lord, magical women and men who are doomed if magical. One of the best things about this series is the world-building feat. Another is the interesting relationships between men and women. As the series progresses, a plethora of legendary characters come into play, and there is much of interest to say of the political intrigue.	2003-04-08

Jonathan Carroll has written a world fantasy award nominee in his book The Wooden Sea. I have read such announcements about it, and I have read it. In the Wooden Sea, his hero is a small town Sheriff named Frannie. Frannie is a guy with a past that is tied to the central locale depicted in TWS. He has a wife and a stepdaughter. Early in the book, inexplicable happenings set up the fantasy in the story, and for a good part of the book, Frannie is trying to unravel this fantastic mystery. And the story works incredibly well as such. I think many readers will enjoy the story until the mystery is resolved well before the end of the book. When it does, however, Carroll chooses to bulldog his way through, making his points as he has intended, regardless of anyone's opinion. I loved this book all the way through to the end, and to me Carroll seems to be making these points: In The Wooden Sea, people themselves are alien and can only understand themselves in hindsight, and that outsiders cannot hope to understand anyone in particular. This seems plain to me when Frannie is asked to save humanity, with he himself a member of it.	2002-12-27

I hadn't heard of Geraldine Harris when I found volume three of this series in a Lexington bookstore. The title impressed me, however-The Dead Kingdom, and I bought the book based on a nice comment printed on the dust jacket. Over the next couple of years I accessed the internet and scoured stores for the other three installments by Harris. They proved elusive, or available but expensive buys on the net in those days. Persistence pays, however, and I found them. I began reading with the first volume, this book: A Prince of the Godborn. Godborn sets up the story, filling us in on Harris's world, providing an image of the main character, the godborn prince of a besieged kingdom. It seems some neighboring warrior tribes are threatening attack, and the Prince of the Godborn must act heroically, undertaking a quest that'll by no means be easy: to recover the keys to 7 ominous citadels, scattered pell-mell across Harris's landscape. The quest expands across the four books, the Prince encountering the kingdoms and citadels one by one, until the final, sobering encounter, as he ascends the enigmatic seventh citadel. FYI- The four books that tell this story are the following: A Prince of the Godborn, The Children of the Wind, The Dead Kingdom, and the Seventh Gate. A great series in my estimation, and a story I completed in back-to-back readings of the four books.	2002-01-20

When I started reading Ron Sarti's Chronicles of Scar, I was lucky to have heard only a little about it before I brought it to the table. If you had told me that it was a science fantasy tale about warring nations, I might not have picked it up; discounting David Weber and Philip Caputo (A Rumor of War), I haven't read many such tales that truly moved me. Fortunately, it suffices to say that  Mr. Sarti is a serious writer who loves history and knows about war. In Scar, he does his very best to entertain us with his knowledge while providing realistic battle situations. And he succeeds. So who is Scar? Simply put, he is a waif whose rise we see, from a life of burglary and poverty to his destiny as a prince apparent to a kingdom. The rise is not easy, a path strewn with seditious lands plotting the overthrow of his kingdom and the ending of the governing codes. We see Scar in love, and his stubborn attitude towards responsibily running  contradictory at times to his willingness for accepting great peril in the name of his father, the King. Summing up, Scar is a well rounded character. And the scenes in this novel ring true-- chillingly so. While reading the last few chapters, I could hardly believe the developments of the story. It just seemed too real. Have fun with this one!	2001-08-20

In The Haunting of Hill House, Mrs. Jackson employs one of her most effective tools in the telling: she's chosen to write about a girl who's chasing her heart's desire, a child determined at all costs to fulfill her singular needs. In this case, she's out to prove to her controlling sister that she can live happily, after losing the mother she'd cared for. Toward that end, she answers an add to participate in a para-psychological experiment at dreaded Hill House. What follows is an unauthorized trip via the family car to the remote location, where she meets a kindly man who runs the project; two more participants: a young man and another lady; and the creepy tenants: an irrascible gatekeeper and an odd housekeeper who speaks in Jackson's weird, trademark mono-phraseology. Soon thereafter, the young ghost hunters are subjected to maddening psychological horrors, like rooms that seem to reposition themselves, cold spots, etc. Mrs. Jackson's central character, the yearning girl, is continually placed in jeopardy, as she tries to cope. This whole book is filled with the haunting prose, both spooky and yearning, that seems to me a trademark of Shirley Jackson's work.	2001-05-08

Moran became a cult writer with the publication of his first book, the Armageddon Blues. Let me give you some idea of what this book is like. Good? Well, I think that some readers will find enjoyment in reading it. But Moran doesn't seek the middle ground with his readers. I found it disjointed and hard to read as a continuous narrative, with some clever ideas. Unusual features of the Armageddon Blues include: (A)its presentation, in short, punchy vignettes that feel like single scenes rather than full blown chapters. Chapters?! (B) A sense of some grand, plotted machinery occurring someplace offstage in the universe, with aliens and stuff. Drama?! Only the personal stuff, about Jalian D'Arsenette y ken Selvren, his female lead, and a couple of others, guys. She doesn't like them. (C) Time travel into the past through a negative entropy universe-- where time flows backwards, basically. The best thing about this book is the tightly focused scenes, some being pretty exciting. At times I found myself laughing and saying WHAT IS HIS PLAN HERE? The book gives you just a hint of what he has planned for later books in this timeline, which he calls the Great Wheel of Existence. This book is not a part of his Continuing Time series. The Continuing Time is set on the Great Wheel, but it gets better kudos than the Armageddon Blues.	2001-04-02

I've only read two books by Jonathan Carroll so far, this one and The Voice of Our Shadow. This is my favorite of the two, mainly because Voice of Our Shadow is closer to being a true horror novel. And I don't usually read horror. But Sleeping in Flame is one of the finest fantasies I've ever read-- Extremely fine. Consider this: The hero of Sleeping in Flame has professional ties to the movie industry. As the story begins, he's walking down a city street when he looks back. A strange little man is trying to run him down on a bicycle! The story becomes one of self discovery for the hero as he tries to unravel the mystery of the strange little guy. Typical? Nope.

As I read this book, I began to see that Pullman's so far beyond me in terms of depth and the understanding of his characters that I don't really have much business reviewing The Golden Compass. Suffice to say, it's easy for the reader to see they're in the hands of a master. All I'll say about this book is that Pullman has an expertly hidden backstory in here. The story unfolds without the least bit of strain, however, and the reader never feels lost. That's because Lyra devotes the focus of her action to righting wrongs that are related to the backstory, and yet don't require you to know what that is, right off. The reader is lulled into a sort of fairy wonder and then is blown away by the complexity of the story to come when certain revelations come at the end. This book is the first of three: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife and during the year 2000, The Amber Spyglass. Pullman really does rank with Guy Gavriel Kay, Madeleine L'Engle, Poul Anderson and Alan Garner as one of the  best fantasy writers since Tolkien.	2001-01-13

This book and the previous review of it reminded me of something Stephen King taught in his On Writing memoir. King, as I've come to understand from reading On Writing, considers plot to be less of a focus when he writes fiction than his characters. He'll put a character in some &quot;situation&quot; and let them react to it, to see the outcome. Barbour and Raleigh seem to have done as much in Shadows Bend. In the novel, Howard and Lovecraft seem almost powerless to control their destiny, driving across the New Mexico desert until they are attacked, and the car is damaged, and an old Indian shaman laughs merrily on finding them. HE'S certainly expected this, if they haven't.     I did find Robert E. Howard pretty stiff as a character, what with his &quot;gettin' some grub&quot; and whatnot. Especially early on. To understand, you ought to read One Who Walked Alone, the first-hand memoir of Howard's life. But Shadows Bend shapes up nicely as REH and HPL attempt to overcome their situation. Their goal of finding Clark Ashton Smith gives the  necessary thrust to the story.	2000-12-20

Varley's Gaian series gave me an adrenalin surge unsurpassed as of yet in all my eighteen years of reading science fiction. This is the purest fun you could have reading, and I believe it's one of the finest science fiction series ever published. My hands might as well have caught fire when I read this! I read this over sixteen years ago, and I still count it among my top five reads, of any kind, EVER. And my personal top ten book list includes UBIK by Philip K. Dick, Varley, Tolkien, Stephen King's Night Shift and The Mist!	2000-12-20

But I bought an early printing over the internet recently, and I just had to let people know about the inspiring  cover art. It features a dark haired girl and a boy on a blue background.  It's pretty in an old world sort of way. I've not seen many other covers  that are painted in this style.    Only one set of three books that I own,  three early fantasy novels by H.M. Hoover, might be by the same, possibly  oriental, artist. I'll check them tonight when I get home.    I've got to  read the books!	2000-09-11

This is a quietly written space exploration novel told from the  perspective of an explorer whose ship came home. I was afraid  that I  wouldn't enjoy this after-the-fact story. But Mann makes this surprising  approach work, for he's more interested in the spiritual change that such  journeys are bound to cause. As such, I found myself drawn into the  mysteries of motivation and action shown by Mann's antihero. Wulfsyarn is a  staggering work of oddball psychology and spirit.	2000-08-09

Howard's stories about ten years ago when a very intelligent friend informed me that Howard had been one of the best writers, along with H.P Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, for Weird Tales  magazine at its beginning. These stories swept me away into Howard's  incredibly savage Hyborian age, with their action, devilish plotting and  larger than life heros.    I realized, before reading the introductions  about Howard, that the man who had written these stories was larger than  life himself. So when I saw the movie of his life, The Whole Wide World, in  the grocery store, I rented it. At the end it credited Novalyne Price  Ellis's memoir, One Who Walked Alone, as its inspiration.    N. P. Ellis  was Howard's girlfriend during the last four years of his life, the period  when he was writing his Conan stories. Mrs. Ellis, a great high school  speech teacher and drama coach at the time, kept diaries and observations  of her time spent with R.E.H. and had them transcribed much later into the  memoir.    N.P.E. had wanted to become a selling writer for most of her  life, and the memoir shows that she had a tremendous eye for detail,  assessing what drove people, and the speech patterns of the time. This is a  fabulous book told as dramatized encounters, arranged with  perfectly-captured coversations she'd had with Howard and others, and  carefully detailed scene development.    I enjoyed the story so well that I  actually went to Howard's house in Cross Plains, TX which they like to show  as a museum. I spoke with many people there who knew about the Howards.	2000-06-30

William Morris is sometimes called the father of modern fantasy. Curious as to the validity of this statement, I searched and found The Wood Beyond the World in a low-cost anthology I had in my library. Much to my delight as I read the novel, I found that this fantasy of visions, quests and magic  could have been plotted today.     But the prose style itself is so  beautiful, so archaic that I wonder if anyone living today could have given  it the tone of Pre-Raphaelite Morris. It contributes greatly to the  reader's immersion in Morris' created world.     The basic story is one of  a prince wanderer who leaves his father's kingdom, is besieged by visions  of a mysterious young woman who is in  terrible danger. The young woman  turns out to be a real person shortly into the book. The core of the story  becomes the wanderer's efforts to save her as they fall deeply in love.	2000-03-24

They have a naming ritual for infants which occurs at a cove. A giant sea creature surfaces there and names the baby.   The baby in  question becomes a heroic warrior named Eyas. The only problem I had with  this book came at the two thirds mark. There was a jarring change in focus  that could have easily ground the book to a halt.    Still, I'll probably  read this book again.	2000-02-22

Verso)	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Kenyon's book is a good, basic story	I just finished reading what I could manage of this book. That was all but the last 120 pages. A new reader of science fiction, an adult reader,  might find this book enjoyable to read. Indeed, I liked most of it myself, except for the beginning of the second part of the book, which rambled so  that I gave up.   Clio Finn is a dive pilot, one of only a few who can  pilot a dive ship through time without  sleeping through the experience.  She is the best dive pilot, having performed a string of dives much longer  than average without burning out. She uses drugs to do this.    Clio is on  the run from DSDE agents who short-list her for extermination because she  killed an agent when she was a child. While running, she had taken this  dive job when her proficiency tested positive. Now she dives to find plants  to transplant in an ecologically devastated earth.    There is action,  mutiny, killing, science, etc in this book.  If I hadn't already read so  many science fiction and fantasy novels, this might have seemed fresher to  me.	2000-01-27

I bought Liege-Killer in its first paperback printing back in the late eighties.  I recall reading the book soon thereafter.  And for once, the recommendations were right.  This book is shockingly good.     Liege-Killer  is the story of a cadre of bioengineered assassins who return to harass  humanity 500 years after being banished to deep space. The assassins are  unusually original in a way I'll let you discover.    The story is set in a  post-holocaust future, where people, if I remember correctly, live on  orbital platforms high above the burned-out earth. I can't remember whether  they travel back and forth to earth.  Anyway, the world is fully realized,  with space pirates, cryogenic stasis, and plenty of details to flesh it  out.      When the assassins return, two five hundred year-old hunters are  brought out of stasis and put to work on the problem...	1999-12-08

I'm writing now to let you know that some of the ideas and images are so visual in this book, and the plot is carried off so well at  times, that the book has stuck with me for the last several months.

In this review I'll ignore all the hype I've read about this book. Instead, I'll list what I found to be its strengths and weaknesses. In the first 40 to 80 pages or so, Clemens' book was visually stimulating, almost cinematic. And it was highly original as he sets up the girl's story, which he clearly has planned to use as the central plot thread. The book, however, is divided into several well-defined storylines. He introduces new characters in each of these. Personally, I think the Ogre's subplot was thinly-developed, merely lip service at this point. I really hope the Ogre's story is fleshed out more visually and compellingly in the sequels. Then there's the witch's one-armed leigeman's story-- it seemed important, and spiritual with his personal struggles. The way he encounters a certain relic was really neat. The elf's quest also seemed good. He is searching for one of his royal family members. And his mojo seems pretty powerful so far. All in all, fairly good. But the separated sections made it seem like I was almost reading three or four unrelated books at times, and this broke the sense of urgency. I wanted to hear more about the girl.	1999-08-23

I am giving this book a very liberal 3 star rating because I was quite impressed with it, even though I believe some people will find the prose quality somewhat lacking.      I myself found it a bit silly at first, but  then I realized something.  McKiernan must picture himself, first and  foremost, as an entertainer, one who  has been forged within the fiery  prose of Robert E. Howard, and other wayfarers on story roads of grandeur.      I began to buy into his archaic, old-fashioned prose.  McKiernan has  great drive as a writer, rendering the story at breakneck speed. He  surprised me at the beginning of the sequel to this one, for he actually  jumps back in time to events occurring offstage during the first book.  I  haven't seen that done elsewhere.     It's a surprisingly good read.	1999-08-11

The thing I found most interesting about this book was Dalmas' description of his hero's day-to-day life and travels in the European wilderness. The author's ability to transport me there was strong, and his knowledge of  ancient Scandinavian culture seems quite convincing to my unschooled ear.   For Dalmas has invented a world where his Neo-Vikings live in tribes, and  wander to towns and cities ruled by warrior kings, and where the hero Nils  Jarnhaan earns the wrath of an evil king. Nils suffers a terrible setback  which he tries to circumvent. And so the saga begins.    This book includes  the first 2 novels in the Yngling saga: The Yngling and Homecoming, along  with some bridging material which explains the holocaust. I found them  highly readable.	1999-07-29
