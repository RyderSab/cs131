I'll just add that I am amazed by Vance's ability to create so many distinctive and funny characters. I have no idea how he does it. There is nothing forced about his humor; it flows naturally with the story. It seems like such an unknown skill to write funny lines which truly sound like they belong to the characters rather than the author behind them.	2005-06-08

Slowly in the sense of reading one or two per year, not as in reading the book slowly. In fact this novel only took about one day. Compared to the others I've read so far (Motherless, Amnesia, and Gun), ASCATT was more romantic and touching. It seems odd to say this as the novel occurs in the realm of academic science.<br />You can get the main outlines of the plot from any of these other reviews, but I find myself drawn to think about Lethem's influences and references. As with Motherless Brooklyn, I found rather strong affinities to some of the work of Oliver Sacks here, particularly in the characters of the two blind men. <br />An obvious refence is in the name of Alice's character. Is the hole that has been opened a door, a mirror, a dream or wish, or maybe a nightmare?<br />I would also assume that the protagonist, Philip, is named for the late Mr Dick who was always trying to make sense of the concept of reality and explore some of the holes in the ways we think about it. I'd be curious to see what other references and influences others have picked up.	2004-06-26

That said, John Howard Yoder's contribution, Practicing the Rule of Christ, is worth more than its weight in gold. The article was originally written as a study guide on forgiveness, complete with study questions. Some additional material was added a bit later in a more standard essay form. This article was, without any doubt, the most provocative thing I've read in quite some time. The ideas from it still swirl around in my head on a regular basis.<br />Plenty of other good stuff on Christian conception of virtues as well.	2004-05-28

I found myself reflecting on it today as I was thinking about the slow death of &quot;classical&quot; music. The author makes the case that rock music is the product of the ideas of 19th century on democracy and individualism, the celebration of things common.<br /> While there has always been a divide between the music of the upper and lower classes, I suppose it was not until late in the 19th century and continuing on that the &quot;lower class&quot; music began to be celebrated by the established musicians. I'm thinking specifically of the folk tune inspired works of composers like Brahms and Dvorak.<br />My reflection on Pattison's book now is that his thesis has been more than adequately proven with the continued growth of bottom-up trends in fashion and music. While rock and roll, as he argues, may have a mythical relationship to African music, modern hip-hop seems to have a very real relationship to current lower class culture. Other authors since then have dealt more generally with this theme I am sure (Theodore Dalrymple comes to mind), but I thought Pattison did great work showing how the ideas of the 19th century thinkers have influenced this development.	2004-03-24

Yes, the book is now almost 20 years old, so it takes some memory stretching to get back to some of his examples, but it is perfectly clear that nothing about television has really changed, at least not for the better, since publication.<br />Even though this book has very little to say about religion, I would love to see churches study this book in small group meetings. Since pretty much nothing has a greater influence on our culture than television, it is worthwhile to take some time and look at what telesision means and how it works as a medium. For those unfamiliar with the book, I will just say that one of the greatest insights I saw in it is that tv is at its worst (and possibly most dangerous) when it attempts to be &quot;serious&quot;.<br />Just read it.	2004-02-22

However, let me start with a description of some of the strengths of Matera's book, which I did find quite worthwhile overall.<br />First, professor Matera writes in clear English. This fact by itself puts him above the great host of biblical studies writers. One is not expected in this work to be fluent in several languages--foreign words and phrases are always translated. This fits well with my view that one of the jobs of a scholar is to make available to interested non-specialists valuable works in other languages. Also, there is very little use of jargon, which sometimes I think is a crutch for some. He does not &quot;dumb down&quot; his subjects (and I'm still not quite sure what &quot;paraenesis&quot; means), but still manages to be lucid throughout.<br />Second, and probably much more importantly, the book's treatment of the Pauline epistles is amaong the best I've seen anywhere in terms of cogent and likely reconstructions of the messages of the books. The section on Galatians stands out as a wonderful example here.<br />There were a few flaws which disappointed me though. One, more of a distraction really, was that there seemed to be a bit too much discussion of the &quot;introduction&quot; subjects, more specifically a lot of pages spent on authorship issues. While this is certainly important and relevant to a degree, it just seemed that this took up more of the book than was really warranted.<br />Another problem, one I think that would jump out to almost any modern reader, is that there is very little sense of trying to connect the ethical teaching of the NT books to modern societies. One gets the feeling oten that this is a museum piece where one is merely looking at a mor or less carefully preserved record of an ancient society. To be fair there is some discussion of the subject of applicability in the later part ofthe book, introduced by this sentence: &quot;Since I have identified this owrk of New Testament ethics as primarily descriptive, I have generally refrained from discussing the normative value of the texts under study.&quot;(p225) This is followed by two pages of discussion of our cultural distance from the NT. I would have preferred, perhaps, to have seen this discussion somewhat earlier in the book.<br />This leads to my last criticism, namely that prof. Matera spends very few words on the context of NT ethics, either in terms of how ethics functioned differently in the 1st century mediterranean world, or in terms of the historical circumstances in which the NT appeared. To be sure, this is not entirely absent, but it occupied so little space that it seems that he didn't find it important of relevant enough to warrant much discussion.<br />All of that being said, the failings of the book (in my mind at least) were in things which the author had not really intended the book to do. Simply as a survey of the teachings of the NT on ethics, I would undoubtedly sy this was a worthwhile contribution.	2004-02-11

Stephen Fry is clearly a gifted writer, and based on this book I might try some of his fiction. However, a great deal of the middle of this book, say 100 pages or more, are devoted to his explaining and defending and preaching on his homosexuality.<br />While I certainly don't begrudge him his right to tell his own story the way he wants and to spend time on what he finds important, this section really dragged on far too long. Aside from this, his story is really quite interesting and provocative. Go ahead and read it.	2003-11-10

I've been preparing, over the last several months, to teach a class at my church on the New Testament in its historical/cultural setting. Out of the dozen plus books I read this was one of the most informative and best written of them. Certainly one needs many other sources to get a full picture of what is going on in the NT and in Matthew in particular, but this book gives a great amount of info you probably won't get from anywhere else. Also, since the author is writing about the context in which Matthew was written, he seems to have no interest in the traditional critical questions such as authorship, date, sources, etc. This makes it friendly to those interested in the Bible from either side of the conservative/liberal divide.	2003-05-27

This volume, like the rest in the series, contains a frsh new translation from the Greek, along with a short (3-4 page) devotional with each section. The translations seem very good to me in terms of putting the author's meaning across in contemporary English. He does take some liberties, preferring to get the general sense/feeling of the text right rather than necessarily sticking with strict word order and close translation (like the NASB does). To make up for this the comments on the sections often highlight some of the translation issues.<br />I found not only the translations, but also the devotionals quite inspiring.

Particularly of note is his treatment of the Mobile, AL public school textbook case, a case in which he served as an expert witness.<br />The overall theme, amply demonstrated and hinted at by the title, is that the constitution of the US has acted as a conservative (or preserving) force on the way our government functions, and how this has helped preserve a somewhat consistent and peaceful way of life here.	2002-04-05

I had not read anything by him previously, though I had heard him on the radio and was impressed by the good work of his John Locke Foundation here in N Carolina. <br />I say suprised because the subtitle led me to believe that the book was primarily a study of the effect that a growing class of american investors is likely to have on future US policies. What I found instead was a history of the relationship between govetnment and investing from prehistoric times to the present.<br />Fortunately Mr Hood doesn't get bogged down in some of the dead ends which such a history might entail if followed too rigorously, such as the common opposition to the charging of interest on loans throughout medieval Europe. He gets pretty quickly to US history where his strengths shine through.<br />A fair chunk of Investor Politics studies the history (and future) of the Social Security Administration, and is honestly the most even and thorough discussion I've seen. His recommendations for policy reforms are carefully thought out and backed by numerous, well explained studies.<br />My reasons for not giving a fifth star are that te book seems to bite a bit more than it can successfully chew, and its somewhat deceptive nature as I described above. But those things aside, the book is quite an exceptional balance between historical research, clear and simple explanations, and sensible policy prescriptions.	2002-03-21

Having just completed _Ethics_, I feel it is a superior work. I was constantly challenged as I was reading to rethink many of my assumptions about ethics from a Christian perspective. The portion at the end about &quot;telling the truth&quot; is alone worth the price of the book.<br />A couple of difficulties I had were that many sections were left incomplete with a bare outline to indicate where he was heading. Also, some of the latter portion of the book was very heavy on historical Lutheran wrtings, of which I am quite unfamiliar.<br />It was certainly stimulating for me as an american to read a quite different perspective on some issues, e.g. submissive relationships. It is typical in this country for people to feel that all rules should apply equally to all. Of course this is absurd when applied to parent/child or teacher/student or ruler/subject relations. Since ethics has to do with how people act towards other people, the actual type of relationship involved has to play a role in how to think about ethical behaviour from one individual to another.	2001-10-21

I'm still trying to sort through the parallels I'm seeing in this book to other great pieces of literature. Perhaps I'll start with G.K. Chesterton who said (I'm paraphrasing here) the world is being destroyed, not by our vices, but by our virtues run amok.<br />The moral heroes in _The Thanatos Syndrome_ are fairly suspect morally. The main character was just released from prison for traficking in narcotics. The villains are brilliant men who want to reduce crime, unwanted pregnancies, medical expenses, violence, and to improve learning, memory and good citizenship. All this by adding a touch of chemicals to the water supply, just like flouride.<br />Other parallels which come to mind are Dostoevsky's novels, or perhaps Robert Penn Warren's _All the King's Men_, where an interlude from a completely different time sheds light on the current action. In this case the interlude is told by an old and senile priest who remembers his youth in Germany in the 30's. He recalls how he felt that his friends were better people than he, and only by accident did he return to the US.<br />The pace of this book does occasionally seem a bit slow, but it was well worth the time put in.	2001-09-25

One test of a good book is this: does it change the way you live your life or how you look at people. Reynolds Price, professor of English at Duke University, explores in this work a theme that hits everyone but that we don't often consider, or wish to consider, that is, the effect of major trauma on one's life and the life of one's friends, and perhaps everyone else around you. <br />RP tells the story of his own experience with spinal cancer in a bold, unflinching, but intensely personal way. One of the themes of the work is how profoundly a patient is affected by the attitudes and communication habits of medical care professionals. While he has tremendous praise for those who showed loving concern for him in his difficult times, he also wonders why some were so callous. For instance, he was informed of his tumor by two doctors while lying on a gurney in a crowded hallway. &quot;What would those tow splendidly trained men have lost if they'd waited to play their trump til I was back in the private room for which Blue Cross was paying our mutual employer, Duke [University], a sizable mint in my behalf?&quot;<br />Also wonderful in this book are his lessons/recommendation for those who have undergone similar tragedies such as this: &quot;Generous people - true practical saints, some of them boring as root canals - are waiting to give you everything on Earth but your main want, which is simply THE PERSON YOU USED TO BE.&quot;<br />For me at least, this book helped change how I look at people, and I hope, will give me strength to deal with the traumas that will undoubtedly come someday to me and those I love.	2001-09-25

Indeed they offer little comfort to the holder of seemingly any position. The great strengths of his thought were in his great perception of the popular lines of political/economic thought of the 20th century, and his unapologetic criticism of all of these ideas.<br />This however, to me, is also the weakness of his thought. He seems to want to stand outside the fray, having no position of his own. This doesn't really get in the way of enjoying his essays though. I do have to admit that many of my thoughts about political ideas have been seriously challenged by this work and think that he brings a valuable contribution the debate about the future of American politics, even some 60 years after origianal publication	2001-03-06

For those Gilder fans out there you know George's inimitable style of erudite and hip prose. He doesn't disappoint in this volume.  So what's it about? It's about the determination of individuals to succeed. It's about people who fail, and fail and fail again but don't give up. Some of the stories he tells are almost beyond belief. The story of the Canadian geologist (I don't remember the name--it's been 21/2 yrs since I read it) frankly inspired me. The chapter on Cuban immigrants to Miami should, if there was any justice, be anthologized widely. The story of the founding of the Honda Corporation stunned me. Gilder's book made me take a hard look at my assumptions about what causes success in the business world.	2000-10-06
