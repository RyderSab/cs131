This one is not so much a mystery as it is a travelogue and explanation of Jewish life in the modern world.  It has always been a bit of wonder that he could present a rabbi who could make such interesting deductions and solve mysteries so easily.  There are always examples of this rabbi thinking outside the box in his books.  It is quite refreshing to read these quirks of logic that are so reasonable and yet unexpected. <br /> <br />This story has a bit of a long workup to the mystery, but then some stories seem to have so many people getting killed, it is a wonder there is anyone left to solve the crime.	2005-07-07

The effort to do what he loved was, ultimately, overwhelming.  He was a school teacher who became a sheep farmer and an author. <br /> <br />I really liked his growth through all the trials and tribulations of life in the Kentucky hills as a school teacher.  He shows how dedication to an ideal, with a bit of imagination, can create a quality that was missing.  Mr. Stuart truly loved teaching.  His greatest success was in helping others learn and come to love the profession as he did.  He has written a paean to the teaching profession and you feel proud for him and all teachers to be able to do what they can do for so little renumeration, and, sometimes, outright hostility. <br /> <br />This is a sad story because the teachers he works with are lured away from where they grew up and are needed, to teach in other districts where teaching is valued a bit higher.  Mr. Stuart, himself, quit school teaching to become a sheep farmer and writer because he could not foresee being able to raise a family on the earnings of a schoolteacher and writer.  But this was in 1920's and 1930's Kentucky where the teacher's motto was, &#8220;Thank God for Arkansas,&#8221; the only state with standards below Kentucky's. <br /> <br />Here is a thought, at one point in his story, he and his teachers were not getting paid, but still teaching and all.  He mentions that he was not expecting this, but was pleasantly surprised when he saw it happen.  I suppose this was in 1929 or so.  But my question is, would our teachers of today do that?  I know that the system and society of today make it highly unlikely for it to happen at all, but still the notion does present a quandary, since teachers today are not farmers or gardeners able to provide for themselves, as those in the old days were.	2005-05-16

The Child is introduced and the story grows from his perspective, but at times the Father is explaining his thoughts and feelings.  I think there is only one time that the Mother is the narrator. <br /> <br />I hate to say to much, in case a reader of this has not read it, but that the Child has returned from a mental hospital to high school is pretty obvious.  I thought the treatment of the depression from the Child's point of view was excellent, and the mentioning of his masturbating was necessary.  The lose of control at the point of extreme insanity, the point when the subject does not know nor can he explain his rationale for doing something, was missing.  But that is minor, the focus of the story is the healing and social growth of the Child, and the Parents.  Not everything comes up roses, but enough does that you feel good about the future for all in this story. <br />	2005-05-16

Abe was captured as an eaglet in 1860 and donated to the company that was forming near there.  It is most telling of the effort from the point of view of the basic infantry that fought the war.  At times you understand the confusion surrounding any battle and other times you feel proud that folks just like you and me could acquit themselves so well in face of horrendous circumstances.  You do not see the blood and guts but you know that it was there and awful. <br /> <br />The bird may as well have been any other animal, but for some reason, the aura of the bird and, maybe, the name, created a situation that made Old Abe into a symbol of the war effort.  This continued for the rest of its life and on into its afterlife as a stuffed bird. <br />	2005-04-23

This one has the oddity of changing narrator from a character to an observer.  There is one point that the narrator gets confused, but it is very minimal and the story goes along very well. <br /> <br />It is unusual to read about bad weather (rain, mist, cloudy days) in Los Angeles.  To those of us from the Midwest, we just do not get the feeling that there is ever bad weather out there. <br /> <br />I liked the development of the daughter, Cindy, into a better person.  She acquires a boyfriend and truly helps people get their lives together.  It is amazing how wonderful these characters are, like in the John Grissom novels, they are above average, even superhuman.  This is not bad, just odd and really good stories.	2005-04-10

I was surprised to find myself reading it from cover to cover.  Usually I read a book like this for a while, read a mystery or adventure or science fiction, then read some more, but not this time.  While I am not up on my German history and this book expects some knowledge to be had, it was still very interesting.  At times you feel that the author is an apologist for Count Von Bismarck, but other times, you can see he is just giving a true to life account, warts and all.  Count Bismarck may need someone to apologize for his excesses, because he would not do it, and because he was a very great man, who should be remembered for his greatness. <br /> The politics of the day are a bit hard to understand for me (I just do not understand why certain wars are fought or not: why were the Balkans so important to Austria-Hungary?  Was it defensive? Was it land and people power (income from the farms and woodlands, etc.)?  Was it social, id est, families and clans fighting for each other?), but to read about the philosophical and personal interplay of Count Von Bismarck and the other heads of state, brings to life some of the challenges the politics of the day.  It also brought to light the real start of the German Federation.  No one ever taught me that Germany was not a country before because it was like the United States before the constitution was adopted, as opposed to France or England, who had royalty overseeing the whole of the country. It is no wonder it did not have colonies before 1860 or so.	2005-03-23

Starting from the introduction of the hero in prison, to the end, you feel that this could happen.  The oddest part of the story is that when you reflect on the happenings, you feel that to describe them a person would be thought insane, these things can not happen in real life, yet, in the story, it is very real and possible.<br /> It may be trite, but his reference to Greek girls is funny.  (Who does he hang out with that he heard this?  I did not hear this until I was 45 or so.)  The little poke at modern pagans is truly interesting.  I really got a jolt when he had a bit in there about a genie who was not like the one in 'Aladdin'.  I wrote a story in that genre, but, alas, he beat me to the publisher.

It is not often I give five stars to a book, but this deserves it.  The stories reveal a society and culture, both English and Indian, that is past and takes some knowledge of history to really understand.  Some are sad, some are happy, and at the end he writes a biography that gives a lot of information about stories included and not included.

President Jackson supporters are variously referred to as \\"Democrats\\" and \\"Republicans\\".  At times it seemed as if Aaron Burr was on his side and at times against him.  My knowledge of history is not sufficient to understand all of these nuances.  This is a book for educated folks, those who have studied the post-colonial, pre-civil war era. <br /> <br />I read it through because of my faith in my ability to garner some facts from it (some other book may build upon what I have learned from this book) and it became interesting when he broke down the voting polls of the elections surveyed, 1825 through 1840 or so.  These breakdowns showed the fallacies of our prejudices of historical persons and events can be seen in statistics, if we define and collect the relevant statistic. <br /> <br />The author is referred to as a 'revisionist historian' and this book is one part of what he was trying to revise - Jackson, the populist candidate, was supported by all parts of the population and some of his policies were not populist at all, id est, the New York banking system.	2005-01-23

It always refreshed the story.  The discription of San Francisco was really good.  It made you want to visit, but it also gave you a feel of the weather and the lay of the land, some stuff you do not normally get in travel books and stories about places. <br /> I was bothered by the lack of notice of the fired bookkeeper.

To anyone who studies Ethics, it may be to simple, but to me, who has barely encountered the notion at all, the ease of understanding was important.  There are parts that I read a couple three times to understand, and parts that just went over my head, but these parts are few and far between.  For the most part, I could understand the ideas he wrote about.  The sad thing was that I have come away with the idea that there is no Ethics but what we bring to it.  But then, what good is a man's grasp if it cannot exceed his reach?  No wonder they still study Ethics: they are trying to bring some universal Ethics down to us from on high.	2004-12-30

She had the great privilege and advantage of wonderful parents who taught her to live by God's word, be humble, giving and to not try to be 'white'. <br /> <br />There are some seriously sad parts in this story, but they are part and parcel of being black and human in this country.

This is obviously based on southwest Asian, or Indian, culture.  I really enjoyed reading and learning about this new world.  It is just about a juvenile story (you know, youth coming of age, growth and development towards fully adult status and good versus evil) but it avoids it by having so much information of sexual and highly developed religious social conventions explained. <br /> The denouement was quite out of whack with any expectation, a very good surprise.  It was quite entertaining to wonder how far the author was going to take his hero towards greatness (prince status, leader of a coup d'ta, etc.).

There is some mention of the ancient Crete civilization that is rather puzzling and is related to the ancient Black Sea culture. <br /> He uses an odd notation system for dates: Roman numerals for centuries, -xx for before common era, and +xx for common era.  I found that I was translating the centuries to numbers to make it understandable to me. <br /> The writing is more interesting than Sir Burton&#8217;s &#8220;The Book of the Sword&#8221;.  There are quite a lot of good ideas and his explanations for the quirks of the ancient people, is really good. <br />Tuesday, July 13, 2004 <br />	2004-10-26

Clarke's story \\"Rama\\" and \\"Rama II\\", though this one ended within one book and it did not have the social dilemma.  The ending was a bit disappointing, but, what else to do?  At least it was positive and did not dwell on the problems that would be encountered in real life.	2004-10-12
