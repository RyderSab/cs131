The spark and sizzle between the former heroes and their ladies was missing with Gavin and Christabel.  Gavin's character develops throughout the novel. He is revealed to be more than just the rogue he presents to society.  Christabel is purported to be goodness personified to the \\"souless\\" Gavin.  Sorry, I'm not buying it.  I found Christabel's goodness self serving and circumstances surrounding her first husband confusing.  Did Lord Haversham orchestrate the attack on Christabel?  The author insinuates that he did and that Christabel eventually found out about it.  Whereas, Mr. Byrne, a complete stranger, treats her with greater kindness and yes, restraint and his reward is Christabel's childish antics which put her in compromising situations of her own making.  Her toying with the nefarious Lord Stokely brings to mind \\"burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me.\\"  I didn't like the game playing jealously gambit.  <br />However, I did like Byrne's character. I just think he deserved better. I still do recommend reading this book as it wraps up the series.	2005-07-19

Ms Evanovich is once again finding her stride. I especially liked Lulu's and Stephanie's analogies with jelly donuts. The secondary characters were in the groove and the cake fight well, hurray for Plum's mum!   <br /> <br />Now the 1 star part, I am getting bored with Stephanie's lack of maturity or commitment in her romantic relationship. I can buy the repeated slap stick antics of cars blowing up, sugar fixes, being thrown in the air and then the garbage. Hey, I watched \\"I Love Lucy\\". But, Lucy committed to Ricky, sure she'd get goofy over some Hollywood hunk and that made for humor. I think we, as readers, have been strung along with the Morelli/Ranger,which one will it be,line long enough. If, it's beyond the realm for Stephanie to move forward at least let either Ranger or Joe have some development.	2005-06-26

The premise was good and the beginning of the book was promising with Nora trying to engage Ewan in dialog. The lenghts she went to and the responses she ellicited form Ewan were fun but, then the sex started and the dialog became practically nonexistent.  I realize Ewan had a lot of angst but after each \\"love making\\" the formula became; he couldn't live without Nora and then he couldn't have her. Of course, none of this was explained to Nora.  I began to lose interest in the plot mainly due to the fact I was tired of Ewan's lamentations. I am hoping for more when I read Lochlan's story.	2005-06-15

The dialog was witty and engaging between the characters and the plots if not real were what romance books are for.  This book fails on all levels. First the premise is irresponsible and rather frightening.  I hope younger readers don't think that an anonymous roadside sexual encounter with a stranger is romance. The dialog between the protagonists lacked spark and their inners angsts became whiny. Whatever Ms Donovan was attempting to portray in this novel was lost on me. If you must read this book go to the library and borrow it.	2005-05-10

If 1/2 stars were possible my rating would go up.This was my first book with this author and it won't be my last. I disagree with another reviewer as I thought Pauline's bumbling around as an apprentice sleuth made for some interesting situations. She reminds me of a beginning Stephanie Plum and her cast of supporting characters.  <br />However, the author needs to get rid of \\"ACK\\". It was used way too much and took away from the flow of the story. Beyond that I think with some seasoning Ms Sokol's adventures will become even more entertaining.	2004-11-10

However, and I think this is an important \\"however\\", if her next book is as bland as TEN the fan index will drop off. Bland and regurgitated, which although not bland isn't inviting either, describe the dialogue and subplots in this Plum novel. Of course, as readers we are spoiled by previous episodes and have come to expect laugh out loud plots and dialogues. These were few in TEN. I agree with another reviewer, I just couldn't find the humor in the dog humping episode, and the unidentified glob in Stephanie's hair,(think \\"Something About Mary\\" but really weird and kinkier) went on too long and fell flat. <BR>Perhaps, it is the total void of humor when dealing with gang bangers, although Ms Evanovich managed to make a book around a sociopathic boxer humorous, but in TEN Ms Evanovich seemed tired and uninspired. Even the sexual byplay was pretty pathetic. Ms Plum has been having regular relations with Morelli (who apparently is rather proficient) so the Ranger shower gel overkill was just that overkill. It didn't work. Finally the ending, I realize this is fiction but after being slugged so hard your teeth go through your bottom lip, manhandled by men who are going to gang rape you, and then watching numerous people get shot to death, I think a bit more of a reaction would have been elicited by Ms Plum and by the men in her life. Personally I think the wedding shower would have made a more humorous comic situation with a chance at introducing different facets to regular Plum characters.<BR>Finally, I think Ms Evanovich needs to \\"fish or cut bait\\" with the never resolved Morelli vs Ranger. The part where I was rather intrigued was the Stephanie pregnant or \\"is she just fat\\" incident, just think of LuLu as a godmother or Morelli's grandmother's reaction if Stephanie refuses to marry or ...well I'm not an author but it does give one something to ponder.	2004-06-28

My review will be short as 2 other reviewers have summed up my feelings.  This book was poorly written. The plot was a disjointed patchwork of subplots. The dialog was static. The writer would randomly hint that a character might have something forthcoming and then drop the thread.  There was no flow from one chapter, really paragraph, to another. No explantion was given as to why Father Cyrus felt such anomosity towards Marc, for that matter what had Marc's father done to have a whole town hate him so much? It was never explained and became annoying and stupid when &quot;town folk&quot; treated the owner of at least one half the town with such open hostility. It didn't make a lick of sense and that sums up my review of the book.	2004-01-12

I disagree with another reviewer's criticism of &quot;wooden dialog&quot;. I appreciated the insight into the different characters backgrounds.  Where so many authors expect the reader to accept at face value why something happened Ms Slaughter gave the reader some history as to why. Parts of the book were violently disturbing but I could understand the descripton as necessary for giving the reader a sense of the horror that was happening. <BR>So, after reading the first paragragh you might ask, &quot;Why only 2 stars?&quot;  It is due to the language used to describe the macabre rape sequenses. The rapist was violent, disturbed and demeaned his victims.  Why the author chose to use the word love and have one victim say, &quot;He made love to me.&quot; is beyond my comprehension.  This has nothing to do with political correctness but everything to do with decency. Apparently the author has never had to counsel a rape victim nor must she have any friends who have gone through the horror of rape.  If she had she wouldn't use the word love in such an obscene manner. It wasn't just a victim but the author describes the rapist as making love to his victim who is staked out on the floor with nails through her palms pinning her down.<BR>Ms Slaughter wrote what could have been an excellent book.  As an author she knows the importance of language and I am sorry she didn't take care with hers.	2004-01-12

Freyja is a difficult heroine but I think could have been made more likeable if those glimpses of humor were fleshed out more.  Joshua was a likeable rogue with a quick wit.  Freya's character needed to loosen up.  The storyline got tiresome and it was a chore to finish the book.  I understand pride but Freyja's became mulish.

I expect by Full Blast the authors will have a smoother style. Can you tell I'm a true half cup full person?  This book is definitely a step up from Full Tilt although I disagree with a review I read that said this book has a Nick and Nora repartee....not quite there yet. <br />Things are still a bit stilted in dialog and plot.  I like the premise of Muffin's interaction but the sizzle is still lukewarm between Max and Jamie.  Dave's paranoia doesn't quite catch if he was to be the comic foil. The writing is still to static...for a visual think pop-up videos.<br />If you are a Stephanie Plum fan consider these books the half hour TV sitcom to Ms Plum as the feature presentation. But as I said before I am optimistic.  I anticipate that Ms Evanovich and Ms Hughes will become more comfortable in combining their writing styles and hopefully future books will display this.	2003-09-14

When I first read This Calder Range I wanted to and did read some of the rest of the series as they became available.  Perhaps it is now with a maturity I didn't have 15 years ago but I just can't give a book 5 stars where the author places partial responsibility for [physical abuse] on the victim. This is a poor message to be sending readers.  A woman should, especially in the marital relationship where there is a promise of love, be able to argue without fear of physical violence. Ms Dailey mentions more than once about Benteen strong moral code of the West and at the same time more than once mentions the [physical abuse] with Lorna accepting partial responsibility. Apparently Lorna is held to a much higher standard than Benteen, as she is responsible for Benteen's actions. It bothers me that Lorna faults herself for a statement made under extreme duress and I might add after Benteen had callously thrown away something very precious to her. Lorna rather quickly forgives Benteen's behavior but on the other hand she has to continually prove herself to him for something said in anger and during extreme physical hardship. So, I guess I have to ask Ms Dailey is it the woman's responsibility to be constantly on guard as to mood and speech?  Not a very satisfying relationship.  Give me heroes and heroines that can have verbal conflicts without violence being the end result. <BR>The other problem I have with the series is how they have become so predictable.  The reader ultimately knows that one of the Calders is going to meet with an untimely death.  It would be nice if one generation since the original Benteen and Lorna would have a happy ending in the tradition of the romance gendre.	2003-07-28
US	52696955	R1VJIHPFMOUSCM	0821773178	365571406	True Bliss	Books	2	1	2	N	N	True Mess	I won't go over the plot as other reviewers already have.  As for the rating if possible I would have given this a 2 and a half star because the story line had potential.  What bogs the story down and is at times confusing is the dialog.  It is so stiff and stilted reading it becomes the same as watching bad actors reading their lines.  The book from dialog to plot was too static for me.  Ms Cameron never developes a flow.  <BR>Also somewhat alarming is the lack of communication between the main protagonists.  Sebastion falls back to the 1980s romantic hero where sex is used to work through any problem.  Bliss, a woman we are suppose to believe stood up to her domineering parents,but when dealing with Sebation she just melts, or runs and then melts, or says no but doesn't mean it and melts, or......I hope you see a pattern here.<BR>Finally, the apparently savy Sebastion has no clue as to the rather sexually deviant people around him. I found this aspect  overdone and rather gratuitous.  I think I'll take back that 1/2 star.	2003-07-02

I read the reviews of Kiss the Moon and figured another winner, not so.<BR>The story is based on the plot that quirky irrepressible Penelope finds a 45 year old crashed plane.  She is under the impression that the crash victims are still within.  So, she does what every adventuresome person would do.  First, she alerts the media and then, &quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; she retracts her statement because she doesn't want the town's hermit nor her not as adventuresome but equally quirky cousin to come into the limelight. Never mind that everyone and their mother knows of both. <BR>Okay, let's say I buy this premise but wait there's more.  The nephew of one crash victim comes to town to find his missing uncle.  Does our heroine show any compassion? No, she's still hung up on saving the privacy of a hermit she isn't even sure is nonthreatening.  But she has her reasons because said nephew is a SINCLAIR.  Now so far the reader has learned that Sinclairs are thrill and adventure seekers....oh how diabolical, so of course Penelope and the rest of the residents regard them as people of dubious reputation and I guess not having the same emotions as &quot;normal&quot; people.  I mean really why would the Sinclair family want to bring home the body of a loved one especially when Penelope has determined the forest is a great resting place.  <BR>So enough already, this book was a complete disappointment.  How anyone could consider Penelope anything but irritating is beyond me.  Get over the constant reminder by the author that she was spoiled as a child, that's suppose to be a legitimate excuse? <BR>The final insult to the reader's intellect is on page 359 (paperback ed.) when Harriet is referred to as Wyatt's half sister, I don't think so...do the genealogy here.<BR>I'm as happy as the next person to escape into a good suspense this was neither.	2003-06-15

Unfortunately, I am new to my area and have no one locally to discuss the book with and I need to discuss this book.  It is a novel that invites dialogue. The historical element and insights were new to me. Thus, this novel opened up a new frontier starting with the &quot;Great Game&quot;.  <BR>But it was the ending of the book that brought about my need for discussion. Any book, article, or speech that invokes or almost demands discussion is 5 stars.  So, here I am awaiting my friend's reading so we can have a discussion as to the &quot;whys&quot; that are rumbling around in my head.	2003-06-11

I'll begin with what I liked.  The historic introduction at the beginning of each chapter.  Although, I have a cursory knowledge of Buffalo Soldiers it has made me want to learn more.  The development and insight into Alfred's character.  Using Alfred as a catalyst to bring about changes in Laura's character, opening her up as it were, was poignant.  The secondary characters of the Heberts brought some lightness into a rather dark novel.<BR>But, and now here it comes,I find it difficult to believe that every child in the town would be so callously prejudice.  Especially when Alfred is described as handsome, intelligent and athletic. Or that the class teacher is so indifferent to the &quot;new&quot; kid, rather a brutal commentary on the education system in Vermont. <BR>My biggest problems however, were the relationship between Terry and Phoebe,his character, and the ending of the book.  First the relationship,this struck me as an everyman's fantasy.  A girlfriend/lover that wants nothing from the relationship. Phoebe was just too good to be true, no demands, no expectations and no recriminations.  I suppose I am to feel sympathy for Terry because of the death of his daughters.  Does this also mean I am to condone infidelity to his wife and indifference to a foster child?  If Alfred hadn't saved his life would the distrust/indifference have remained?  A rather stringent lesson to prove one's self worth.  I found Terry weak, self centered, manipulative and a hypocrite.  Never once did Terry or Phoebe consider that eventually the unborn child might want to locate his father and what results that might have on Laura's and Terry's relationship.  Infact, the ending was just too pat. Phoebe quietly leaves with no ill will towards Terry, Laura forgives Terry....but wait how can that be as she has no knowledge of the unborn child?  Does this suggest a sequel where she will be just as understanding when the &quot;child&quot; comes a knocking on her door 20 years later?  How can a relationship exist between Laura and Terry with this rather onimous cloud hanging on the horizon.  No, there are too many problems with Terry's character and the author's lack of accountability with it for this to be a satisfying book.	2003-06-11

I realize romance is fiction but must be a bit pausible.  If our hero, Kyle, can stay away from a one weekend stand for 4 years why can't he, with numerous lives on the line, keep his zipper up for 5 days?  Delanie was suppose to be the brains of her family, a scary thought. Why did she do everything possible to foil a mission, risking a lot of lives to do absolutely nothing of value?  She hated playing the bimbo yet she did so without any prompting.  I bought this book right after reading Kiss and Tell.  What a disappointment, whereas in K&T the hero and heroine are both competent in H&S this is not the case.  I'm still looking forward to ST John's book but I hope his heroine shows more common sense and likeability.	2003-04-26

Within a chapter we are told about Morgan's search, Serenity's secret and then it's all tied up in a bow...the end.

I found it rather shallow that Eve can forget all the support she has received by one ill conceived action by Joe.  I can't figure out what she has ever, in previous books, done for him.  Or when she has ever thought about any one else's situation first.  I still rated this book 3 stars because I liked the plot.  Scary enough in this world to be believable. It reminded me of some other mysteries where there are secret organizations and the forensic sculpting just adds another dimension.  In fact, this is a first for me to like the plot but not the main character.  I can't figure out what makes Eve so desirable to the men around her.  She is selfish to a fault and certainly expects more than she is willing to give.  She has become an unsympathetic character.  I enjoy her conversations with her daughter Bonnie but even a ghost has to get a bit tired of always bolstering up the adult.  Why Joe has stuck around is a mystery to me.  Unless he likes being walked on and over.  Galen's character brings the spark necessary and Jane, I disagree with reviewers who think she is too precocious. But unless Eve can become less whiny please don't make her the lead character in any more books.  Not unless it's one where Joe finally leaves Eve and she has to become a less selfish individual.	2003-04-02

I hit the jack pot for this is vintage Krentz.  Now that I have read the book and the reviews...a backward approach....I am delighted that the readers are again charmed by Ms Krentz's signature style.  I too, have been disappointed in her recent works but all is forgiven with this charming tale. The story line grabs your interest from the first sentence, the plot twists and intrigues keep you on your toes and the interesting support characters are the icing on the cake.  <br />My response to the negative reviews regarding Zoe and Ethan is I definitely felt the spark and liked the other sly hints of sparks with the other characters....rather interesting. I also disagree that one husband should mirror another.  Life experiences alone can change the relationship needs of an individual.  I liked the fact that both characters were strong enough to stand up to one another but not  so much so that every scene became a battle of the sexes. The dry humor exhibited by both was a delight.  Now all I need to make the literary world right is for this level of writing to carry over to Amanda Quick novels.	2003-03-03

I appreciate her strong heroines.  They have pluck without being obnoxious.  They have feminine strength and grace and give as good as they get.  My only problem and I'll just address Master of Seduction is the need to tie up loose ends with forgiveness for horrific behavior.  In Seduction I could understand Jack's forgiving his mother for her treatment, though that in itself took Christian charity to the limit.  But, I find it very hard to believe that anyone could forgive his father.  He abandons Jack three times, first with his mother, second after his mother's death leaving him in slavery to a sexual predator, and finally by not letting his maternal grandfather reach him before his death or after with an inheritance that would have sustained him. Ms Mac Gregor creates cruel mean characters to innocent children and then in the last few pages of at least 2 of her books  expects all to be forgiven.  What is truly hard to fathom is her heroines would facilitate these acts where the victim is expected to make the first move.  She should stick to her good use of lively dialog between her lovers and if she wants to have vile characters don't try and wrap it all up neatly in a bow at the end.	2003-02-27

This book is definitely not in a league with Ms Evanovich's Plum series.  The characters were not as vivid,the dialog was not as laugh out loud funny, and the romantic tension in &quot;Tilt&quot; was tepid rather than steamy (be still my heart Morelli and Ranger). But,I've read far less engaging books, a back handed compliment if ever there was one. So, hopefully the second book, and I will buy it, will have gotten the kinks out and will begin to come up to the level Ms Evanovich's readers know she is capable of producing.	2003-02-18

Obviously I like romance novels but there is, to me, a fine line between the totally annoying I will be independent at any cost heroine and the simpering Miss heroine.  Ms MacGregor has, in this book, walked the line very well. Maggie comes across as a likeable, charming person who can match wits with Braden quite well.  Braden is the charming likeable rogue. The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star was I had trouble with the end of the book when Braden decides to overcome his fear of commitment. I just wish it had been a bit more firey with Maggie. But that was slight and I've already got Sin's story on order....interesting men the MacAllisters and the women who claim them.	2003-02-18

I like the introduction of new character lawyer Klough and Lulu is still a \\"lulu\\". I do agree with negative reviewers in the need to broaden Stephanie's character.  She can be intelligent and still be surrounded by craziness.  As to romance it needs to move forward either put her with Morelli or let her have a big affair with Ranger.  I can see it either way, a Nick and Nora relationship with Morelli or I don't know what with Ranger!  Personally I can see Ranger pairing off completely out of type with an older homebody type just to make everyone wonder and be crazy. I will still be preordering my books.  So far this one has made the rounds of 2 friends with more waiting for their turn.	2002-06-30

I agree with previous reviewers who found this book slow and dull.  There is no spark between the protagonists.  The repeated formula of distrust and the juvenile behavior is tedious.  I had hoped Ms Krentz was going to get back on target but to find out this is first in a series is disheartening.  The slightly good from all this is I have time to read and discover new authors.	2002-04-02

The Daphne books twist was original and fun reading at the beginning of each chapter.  The book lost it's umph at the ending when Phoebe and family appeared.  Molly IS a 27 year old woman and I rather doubt that anyone that age, especially someone who's had to partically raise herself would put up with that much family interference but even that I was able to overlook.  What capped my rating was the proposal and Molly's need to have Kevin &quot;prove&quot; himself yet again.  The man had just given up his career plans, faced down her powerful family and she still needs more?!  Too emotional needy for a truly loving relationship.  Left me wanting to say grow up.	2002-02-21

I liked Meggie's character, she has a sense of humor, a refreshing outlook and a quick mind.  What bothered me was the wedding night scene.  I don't like the use of violence to subdue Meggie.  I thought romance writers had caught on to that fact.  The scene in the tavern afterwards helped make up for it partially but obviously not entirely thus my rating.  Thomas does redeem himself although it would have been nice if once in the book he actually helped rescue Meggie or better yet partnered in helping her instead of just gnashing his teeth.	2002-01-22

There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me.  He didn't have the gumption to break off his &quot;engagement&quot; before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed.	2002-01-05

(Time of Your Life)	Books	2	6	9	N	Y	Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz	I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis.  After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing.  Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character.  Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy.  The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further.  That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character \\"melts\\".....pun intended.  I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ...  I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library.	2002-01-02
US	52696955	RFC637J3AGP0C	1551662701	256053596	Lady'S Choice	Books	1	1	6	N	Y	A Bad Choice	To put it simply I didn't like the heroine nor her family, my question is where was the &quot;hook&quot; on Ms Krentz's part to engage me with this nest of vipers. Juliana's family has no redeeming value unless you think the loyalty shown towards each other off sets the lack of ethnics to all others outside the &quot;family circle&quot; in other words think Medici.  Juliana's forcefulness would be considered abusive or at the very least not very PC if Travis had exhibited the same behavior towards her, not a likeable heroine.  I am glad I borrowed this book.	2001-07-27
US	52696955	R9ZMYPY474ZK	0312252617	272135612	Fast Women	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Fast women but loose story	[...] I start out with a disclaimer, I enjoy Ms Crusie's books, I do I do, for I too, have bought her books hot off the press.  This one left me confused as I thought the storyline became too disjointed.  I enjoyed the beginning and had recommended it to a divorced friend after the first 100 pages. There are some close to home comments on marriage and life after.  I am now hedging on the recommendation.  First, what's up with the proof reader? On the first page there's a typo, which as a teaching assistant during my college years I got reamed for not finding a comma operator on the first page of a paper I was correcting for a professor.  I am referring to,&#34;Yes, I think you better to look into that,&#34; maybe picky but the first page??!  Second, by the end of the book what exactly did Nell and Gabe resolve?  When the lust fades what chance does their relationship have? Fighting constantly is not being strong it's just being wearing. Female leads from Ms Crusie's other novels were strong without the constant one ups-manship.  I had hoped after Nell makes some correlations between her past marriage and her relationship with Gabe there would be some peace or at least I don't know, I guess I was looking for some hope besides the physical thing.  Also what about Margie will she drink herself into oblivion as her personal life has been turned upside down with some rather shocking revelations.  Finally the whole china conversation as to who was who, with the exception of the walking egg cups and their final symbolism, was too rambling with names being thrown in and out.....Now this review sounds harsh and that wasn't the intent. I envy Nell her friends both male and female and their ability to stick it out together. The story is a good read but I guess the author has spoiled me for I expected a great read, ah anticipation, I still look forward to her next book.	2001-06-02

But hopefully I'll save someone some money.  I read the reviews and bought the book, just goes to show we are living in a very different world.  The book was about lust not relationships nor love.  I thought the premise and the first few pages were good and that's where it ended.  Where the authors could have taken character development and a snappy dialog they just fell back on sex.  Why does Brook fall in love with Alex?  Why does she think he's such a wonderful person?  Is it because he lies to her, blackmails her and uses sex to control her?  And the authors say Brook is loyal and so family oriented yet she can't spend one hour in Alex's company ( a man she thinks got her sister pregnant and then dumped her ) without wanting to jump his bod.....that she waits for maybe a day is commendable? Or that she continually feels guilty absolves her of her actions.  All I can say if that's your idea of a noble sister well, I'm glad I have brothers.  If you took out the smoldering sex scenes or the angst of wanting sex and broke this book into plot and dialog it would be a quarter of it's size.  Don't think I'll be giving these authors another go round.  I'll save my money for Krentz, Crusie, and Evanovich.	2001-04-13

Seems rather impausible to me. Plus I don't understand all the hostile reaction to Dougald.  He was highhanded but the reviewers are putting 21st century morays on him.  I was more upset with Hannah, I mean the man did try to find her for 8 years and in the ninth year he didn't &quot;out&quot; her.  He seemed to genuinely fear for her safety those first years.  The reviewer who pointed out that both individuals had grown up over the intervening years helped give me a more favorable perspective to this book.   However,Hannah's character was too  selfish and immature for me to really enjoy. She didn't trust her friends and left her spouse to reap all the ill will with her disappearance not very admirable traits in a heroine.	2001-04-03

And it is not this book.  I should have placed higher value on mrsgiggles review.  I, too, don't appreciate a juvenile, petty, abusive, self pitying hero.  Unfortunately the heroine in this book didn't have much to choose from in the hero category.  In most cases give me Amanda Quick aka Jayne Krentz, Julie Garwood, Catherine Coulter and Nora Roberts.  Their heroes and heroines may have problems but they are also entertaining and not constantly sniveling about their lot in life. A man can be rough around the edges, that's character, but forever misunderstanding and wallowing in it and then taking it out on the woman who stands by him...well no thanks.  Even when Adrian &quot;acknowledges&quot; his love his first thought is how Lillie can &quot;save&quot; him...so much for his love, it's still all about him not them.	2000-10-14

Both his meddling grandfathers are for this loveless match.  Then when he finds a woman,Sabrina, who is also his best friend, at least one grandfather is against any match because it's not love.  Like the unknown first beauty was.  Then Duncan places honor above his personal preferences to save Ophelia while at the same time he has compromised his &quot;best friend&quot;. So the moral of the story is be honorable IF others may be aware of an dishonorable act but be dishonorable if you don't think you'll be caught.  Sounds like politics to me.  Sabrina was a bit too understanding and self effacing,and I couldn't figure out what inspired the loyal feeling to the Scottish grandfather, not a very likeable character.  All told too many mixed messages.  Perhaps the author will get it right if she uses Rafe Locke for her next hero but please not a reformed Ophelia as the heroine.  She was the only character besides Rafe, whom I enjoyed. She, I enjoyed disliking.	2000-10-03
US	52696955	R1ZIB3YWI8DCRF	038080736X	946460613	Bride for a Night	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Digging Through	This is the first book by Patti Berg I have read and I had to really &quot;climb&quot; my way through it. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book.  The main characters were too immature and irresponsible  to become likeable.  If anything I am amazed that Duncan would forgive  Cairo for misleading him for five years. There's got to be more than  &quot;long legs and a lush tush&quot; to sustain even a romance novel's  love.  I realize the author tried to get the reader involved in Cairo's  issues however the author negates any sympathy when she points out how  Duncan HAD been there for Cairo  while she was growing up......so why does  Cairo forget all this and  heap on her parents' mistakes on his head?  It  doesn't make sense especially when Cairo leaves her own son for her own  career. Basic fact, if you don't like the heroine in a romance novel this  is a major stumbling block to the rest of the novel.  <br />I am going to give  this author another go as the reviews that knocked BRIDE FOR A DAY praised  WIFE FOR A DAY. Although I'll look for the book at the library before  gambling my hard-earned money on this author.	2000-07-13

My problem was with the 2 female leads.  I couldn't sympathsize with Rosalind and found her at times  annoying. Obviously, since I buy and read romances I like escape but up  until the end her mousy and her escapist behavior was irritating. Given a  flesh and blood Lance or a ghost...it was very difficult to believe her  dilemma.  Effie was just irritating and too self centered to be found even  amusing......the glinpses of Kate however show promise and I have high  hopes for a sequel with Kate, Val and Rafe (whom I feel should be given  some happiness...dare I suggest by marrying one of Anatole's  daughters----just a thought.	1999-09-12

The reader was to feel  empathy for a character who had none to offer unless it was on the brink of  or after brutal death....  NOT a very likeable woman.
