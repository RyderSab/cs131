A CULT	Melody Carlson got me quick and deep into Cassandra's thoughts and her rough and tumble faith journey of survival.  It was hard to pull away from this book, so I didn't.  Cassandra's first person account tends toward self-pity at times but in a true-to-life type of way.  A bunch of kids make stupid mistakes and learn that doesn't weaken God's power.  LOOKING through Cassandra's troubled eyes paints a full landscape of developed characters in an upside down world.	2004-11-29
