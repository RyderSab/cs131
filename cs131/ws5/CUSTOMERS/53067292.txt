I was transported back to a time and place I never knew and felt as if I were there. I had heard of the unidentified little blonde girl, but thought I had read that she was indentified. After reading this, one is left wondering once again. I read this in one sitting and I would imagine you will also.	2003-05-20

This unconditional bonding between mother and child exists and never is broken, although the two may reverse roles a bit when approaching death. I cannot read this without tears streaming down my face.  It ranks up there with \\"The Giving Tree.\\"	2003-01-09

Except for the hype, one would not know these two were brothers by the writing.  However, at times it is uproariously funny, but the drunken larks and women seem to get somewhat repetitive and tiresome. For the most part, it held my attention, but it's one of those books you could open about anywhere and not have missed that much.  Pretty good for a book to read on a plane.	2003-01-09

The copy I read was passed on to me from a friend...there was no cover, the pages were loosened and all was held together with a large rubber band.  That was evidence of how many times it had changed hands. I read it and passed it on.  It may still be circulating somewhere. I now own a signed first of this book.<br />  The book is set in WWII and is expansively told from the point of view of different characters...both those on the homefront and those on the front line. From time to time, their lives intertwine, although not always directly.<br />  If you love historical fiction, WWII, or simply a page burning novel, you will love this book.  Read it...caress it...pass it on...and, if you happen across the one with the rubber band, handle it lovingly.	2003-01-08

Give them a microphone and have them describe their life and surroundings. This book is the result. It is appalling what conditions are like there.

I was about a hundred pages into this when I realized he was no longer giving me an historical setup.  There were not going to be any spies in this book.  By then, I was hooked in both the study of cathedral building and the characters. The characters have depth and you can hardly put this down. He also has a way of hitting you smack in the face. For example, you get very interested in one of the main characters and then...BOOM...he kills him off. <br />  Of course, I highly recommend all his spy novels, but I think I've come to like his historical fiction even better.  This and \\"Passage to Freedom\\" are remarkable.	2003-01-08

It turns out this was a real hotbed for the KKK and they were extremely powerful controlling cities, police, the governor. If you think of the KKK as Southern, this book will set you straight. The head of the Indiana KKK was D.C. Stephenson who was tried for rape and murder. A truly scary book, but a page burner and dead-on historically.	2003-01-08

It's well written, but I have a few problems with it. First of all, it's fairly obvious that he thought most of us from rural Ohio were a bunch of nincompoops...or, gnarled apples. Secondly, the religious nut guy in the field was a stretch and, perhaps, downright ridiculous. So much has been read into this book that it has become overwrought. Everyone should read this, but not necessarily believe it.	2003-01-06

I had heard something about nanotechnology, but really didn't understand its potential implications. Jack Forman the leading character has depth. There are the usual Crichton precocious kids, but he doesn't use them to explain the science...thank goodness. A few of the other leading characters are cardboard, but it is with reason.	2002-12-22

It took me a little over a week.  I would read some and then put it aside.  The premise of the book held promise.  A handyman on an estate inhabited by an ancient woman finds an abandoned baby.  He turns into a wonderful father, and the old woman seems to have found new life. But, alas, all for naught because the old woman doesn't trust him after all. While the robbery seemed contrived to me, there had to be some way to end this.  Given the brevity of the novel, apparently Anna thought the same thing. The last fifty pages were the best.  Once again, Anna did show her ability for fine writing, but the characters were a bit one-dimensional.  I would have like to have explored them a bit more in depth.	2002-11-13

Wannabe President Kerry Kilcannon is a great character study of someone who is unsure just how much to lose or compromise to ascend to the highest office.  What's nice is that he is an honest to goodness good person.  I wish he were running for office in real life.  I recommend this book.

This was a fun book because it takes us inside the Library of Congress and into the very expensive and illusory world of rare books.  I have yet to read a book in this series that I have not liked.  I find Margaret Truman to be a bit underrated and ignored in the mystery field.  She puts me in mind of Agatha Christie as she also spins a good mystery without all the blood and gore.	2002-03-14

The three novellas are connected through Davita (of \\"Davita's Harp).  The \\"Ark Builder\\" is a sensational story that captures the emotions of a young survivor of the Holocaust.  The second story concerns an ex-KGB officer and professional tormentor whose position was to extract confessions from people, both the guilty and innocent.  Finally, we see a man facing his own mortality and his wife's impending death from AIDs.  This is stortelling at its best from the master. Perhaps the best thing about Potok is his ability to write for all ages.	2002-03-03

It is the classic tale of adultery and what happens if you go astray and refuse to be contented as a cow.  The writing was magnificent.<br />  I can sympathize to an extent with Emma.  She was a true romantic, trapped in a dingy provincial town.  Of course, if one is too jaded, one might find the ending akin to a country western song where the woman dies, the child dies, the lovers desert, and the long-suffering (albeit boring) husband dies.<br />  If for no other reason, read this one for the sheer brilliance of the written word.	2002-02-03

Brinkley is able to re-create how Washington DC went from a sleepy village to the thriving community it is now.  Read how those crummy government buildings were only supposed to be temporary.  How those girls came for work from the farms, bought leg makeup, and stayed.  How the Japanese and German ambassadors were placed under guard in a mansion and still couldn't get along.

It shows what can happen when anti-semitism is preached from the pulpit year after year.  In fact, it shows what can happen when any one group is ostracized or shown to be less than by a willing clergy.  Anti-gay sentiment has given us Matthew Shepard and anti-jewish sentiment gave us the Holocaust.  It is a well known fact that both the Catholic and Protestant clergy was highly anti-jewish.  I recomment this book highly.  Not an easy read, but well documented.	2002-01-20

I guess if you were one of those people who drew horses during art class in school you might like it.  I wasn't one of them.  I like Lidie Newton and Moo, but this book??? NEIGH...NEIGH....	2002-01-17

I was 10 in 1958 and attending Catholic school in Ohio.  This fire scared me to death.  I remember praying in class for the dearly departed.  Like other reviewers, I, too, tried over the years to find a book about this fire.  I did and it is one fantastic read.  You simply can not put it down.	2002-01-06

It held my interest to an extent.  However, I got the feeling he knocked this one off in about the time it takes to type it.  It takes about 3 minutes to figure out his daughter is coming home for Christmas.  Wait for the paperback.	2001-12-16

My husband and I read aloud to each other while on vacation in the mountains.  A roaring fire and much laughter.  One of the best books ever!  When, oh when, Fannie are you going to write more books?	1998-07-18

Conservatives find it preachy.  Liberals love it.  Some Republicans were even offended by it.  I think that was the point.  I loved it!  I had not been able to finish a Grisham book since Pelican Brief, but I was enthralled by this one.  I am going to give it as a gift to all my conservative friends who have bought such inane things as Random Acts of Kindness for me.  Go Grisham!!!!!!!!  (By the way, I'd love to see James Earl Jones as Mordecai Green.)	1998-02-22

My favorite line was, &quot;If brains were made of dynamite, he wouldn't have enough to blow his hat off.&quot;  Ting-a-ling.  I will miss Vonnegut's work so much.  For those trying to find a plot, a plot is not always the point.  Vonnegut is not for everyone.  But, he is for me.	1998-01-01

This was a good airplane book.  Kept me interested from Florida to Nebraska.  Yes, the characters are somewhat immature, but so is the author.  Let's give this guy a chance.  This was his first book.    I have to admit the ending was hokey, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  And, while there will be a movie, it at least didn't read like he had written one.  Grisham could take a lesson	1997-06-02

I found it boring.  Does anyone else get tired of his explaining the too complicated techie stuff to some inane character?  This time is was the assistant; usually it's some precocious child.  And what about that assistant?  Didn't know what to do with him at the end?  So, you made him a drug dealer (no hint of that in the rest of the book).  This book stunk	1997-04-27

This book sold me on Koontz; although, I must say some of his later contributions disappointed.  I read this beginning in the soft shadows of twilight and finished early in the morning.  I had to sleep with the lights on.  What better kudo can you give to a horror novel	1997-04-27

It just didn't deliver.  And, it was factually inaccurate as it concerned the internet. It is mildly amusing, but most readers will figure it out in the first few chapters.  Read Pillars of the Earth or A Place Called Freedom instead	1997-04-27
