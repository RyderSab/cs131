Nichols type illustration done in pastels on the front cover---so reminiscent of the high-strutting Parisian walking her (yikes) dog on the cover of popular diet book \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\".  At first, I thought this was yet another dieting treatise, yet another way to capitalize on America's love/hate relationship with our cheese-loving, wine-scarfing, chocolate-chomping buddies from across the ocean who somehow after all this eating manage to fit into those tight little couture pencil skirts and red and white apache tops.  And then I saw the cat featured in the drawing---mais oui, it was a cat. Bien sur, I said, ce livre, ce n'est pas serieux; c'est une blague.<br /><br />And then I got passed those cute little illustrations and actually read it.<br /><br />Okay, I'm being a little obnoxious, but believe it or not, Henri de la Barb, in the guise of a parody, has written an even more entertaining and informative book than Mireille Guiliano.  Guiliano's book, a sucre-filled memoir containing a French arsenal of vague tips detailing how she was defeated by the battle of the bulge  America-style and had to retreat back to France and the methods of a certain Dr. Miracle to re-attain her Gitane-slim physique, contains anecdotes and recipes spread over 200+ pages.  De La Barb, offers equally compelling information that can be utilized to actually lose weight with less than half the verbage, Veuve Clicquot-free advertising and ooh-la-las.<br /><br />Okay, some of the recipes are a bit on the 'cat'astrophic side---our feline amis/amies certainly recommend mice and not mousse---but the idea of eating real food (in this case, for humans) prepared well and partaking of only a small portion seems to eptomize the best of common sense / highly nutritional dieting. Les Chats de la Barb actually eat seasonally, recommend purchasing only enough food for a day, and sum up all their tips in a shameless abbreviated mimicry of Guiliano rather arrogant much ado about nothing.<br /><br />But his cats are practical too, knowing that they will not be able to run off on a whim to the local Dean & DeLuca's just to buy the best triple cream and Valrona truffle, he makes allowances for those situations where convenience is key.<br /><br />Consequently, De La Barb's book is much more fun and speaks la verite; we laugh out loud at his prissy little pussies and their over-the-top antics, but we are not quite sure whether or not to laugh at Guiliano's pandering of her nationality and the odd mystique it has over many Americans.<br /><br />C'est une blague, n'est-ce pas?  Mais pas de blagues, buy this book instead, its funny, doesn't take itself seriously and its much faster to read, delivering the same message without the hype.  Of course, its a humorous treat for cat-lovers, too.n a shameless abbreviated mimicry of Guiliano rather arrogant much ado about nothing.<br /><br />But his cats are practical too, knowing that they will not be able to run off on a whim to the local Dean & DeLuca's just to buy the best triple cream and Valrona truffle, he makes allowances for those situations where convenience is key.<br /><br />Consequently, De La Barb's book is much more fun and speaks la verite; we laugh out loud at his prissy little pussies and their over-the-top antics, but we are not quite sure whether or not to laugh at Guiliano's pandering of her nationality and the odd mystique it has over many Americans.<br /><br />C'est une blague, n'est-ce pas?

I was disappointed.<br /><br />Jesse Sullivan's mother has amputated her own finger, and no one knows why or if she will mutilate herself again.  Jesse leaves her empty nest and her handsome pychiatrist husband and rushes back to the South Carolina island of her childhood and to the eclectic group of women that make up her mother's circle of friends.  While attempting to the discover the meaning behind her mother's actions, Jesse must face some issues of her own, primarily her instant attraction to Brother Thomas, a member of the island's monastery, seeking spiritual asylum after the death of his loved ones, the guilt she feels over her father's death and her own quest for her lost identity.<br /><br />Sounds entertaining and unsettlingly insightful, but instead, Kidd does not reproduce the nuanced yearning of the adolescent Lily of \\"Bees\\" as heard from a megaphone of experience, instead she creates a rather uncomfortable portrait of a woman unsure of herself and her place in the world on the many levels, of woman, mother, wife, daughter, artist, child, friend and lover--a rather sad commentary on suburban American life which isn't explored in all its possible complexities. None of Jesse's subsequent actions or revelations are necessarily earth-shattering, instead they seem almost unimportant and a waste of a reader's valuable time, making no real statement about life in general or 21st century life as 'Bees' did with regard to attitudes in the South during the Civil Rights Era or the delicate unfolding of a budding wonam's soul.<br /><br />More particularly, whereas the Calendar Sisters of \\"Bees\\" are rendered with a deft hand for character without being stereotypical, Nellies' longtime friends were too familiar as mundane parodies of the overly commericalized Ya-Ya sisterhood.  Unoriginal.  Again the character of Hepzibah could have wielded great literary power as the apex of all of the island's mysterious goings-on as symbolized by the Mermaid's Chair, instead, she is reduced to a mangled soliloquy on the beach in front of a canned fire without even uttering anything vaguely as memorable as a single 'Ya-Ya'.  How sad.<br /><br />Bottom line:  for me, this book only worked on the level of adequately describing the lush nooks and cranies of the Carolina low country set against the roiling of the grey Atlantic.  For a better portrayal of southern sensibilities, stick to the old masters: Faukner, Welty and Katherine Anne Porter. If the key to self-discovery is what you want, almost any other book will do.haracter of Hepzibah could have wielded great literary power as the apex of all of the island's mysterious goings-on as symbolized by the Mermaid's Chair, instead, she is reduced to a mangled soliloquy on the beach in front of a canned fire without even uttering anything vaguely as memorable as a single 'Ya-Ya'.

Using full color photographs and diagrams, the book's 360 pages offer fairly comprehensive groupings of nouns with appropriate verbs and some idiomatic phrases for the different categories of People (body parts, expressions, family) Appearance (clothing and grooming), Health (ailments, exercise), Home (house, workshop, decorating, gardening), Services (emergency, banking, telephone etc.), Shopping(markets, florist, pharmacy, etc.), Food (fruits, vegetables, dairy, etc.), Eating Out(restaurant, breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)  Study (school, science, math etc.), Work (office, computer, farm, etc.), Transportation (roads, cars, trains, buses, planes etc.), Sports (Soccor, basketball, hockey etc.), Leisure (arts, music, games, outdoor activities, camping, etc.), Environment (Space, the earth, landscape, plants, animals, etc.), and reference( time, numbers, weights and measures,maps, useful phrases etc.).  The book also includes a full index of Italian to English and English to Italian words cross-referenced with the page number where they appear in the book.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is its failure to be Italian specific.  As I also have the French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary published by the same company, I can say with some regret that the format and the pictures are identical in both books.  In the Food section, for example, there is no section that introduces specifically Italian cheeses, concentrates on depicting Italian desserts or gives some rudimentary introduction to the Italian  amero or digestivo.  I would have liked to see specific Italian brand names depicted so that when I do go to the market or the coffee bar in Italy, I would already have an idea of what the packaging or product looks like as well as the correct word because I was using the book as a primer prior to my venture.  In addition, in the building section, I would like to have seen Italian specific buildings i.e. Il Colosseo  along with the generic buildings of the church, the mosque etc.<br /><br />Although not absolutely necessary, I would like to see the edges of the pages color-coded or indexed like a dictionary with fingertabs which would enable the user to better find the appropriate section with less skimming through the entire book.<br /><br />As I think this is a great reference for the traveler, I would have loved to have brought it along on a recent trip to Italy.  More importantly, as a student of Italian, I fully appreciate the visual cataloguing which jumpstarts any essay writing or conversational skills building in Italian on any of the detailed subjects.<br /><br />Recommended as a concise, attractively formatted book in the style of other easy to read Eyewitness publications.o my venture.

The painting's focal point is not Christ, but the devil.  The devil wears no horns nor sports a pointed tail; he is attractive and extremely alluring.  This seemingly benign appeal, Daniel discovers augurs the spell the city has yet to cast upon him,  adequately mirrors the human avarice of all the novel's players and offers a bit of a biblical metaphor for the events of this partial police procedural/battle between good and evil.<br /><br />From the moment he arrives to catalogue the library of the ancient Scacchi family he is surrounded by its eclectic members entrenched in their own whacky sophistication-a sophistication  that camouflages needs and desires that are as corrupt and beautiful as any old palazzo crumbling into the Grand canal, When he finds the manuscript of a brilliant violin concerto written during the time of the maestro Vivaldi, he suddenly knows what it is like to be Tintoretto's Christ and to mistakenly turn the devil's stones into bread.. When his employer asks him to buy a priceless black market violin, and pretend that he is the author of the found manuscript, Daniel feels he is about to fling himself off that temple wall and prays that the foretold angels will  break his fall.  Ultimately, Daniel sees the devil for what he is, and instead of accepting the wealth of all the kingdoms of the world, he saves his own soul and the souls of a two beautiful women seduced by the magic of the violin concerto and the world of power and music that brings such beauty to the life in an otherwise corrupt world..<br /><br />Juxtaposed with Daniel's story are the letters of 19th century Lorenzo Scacchi, another tempted Christ  who knows first-hand the secret of the violin concerto, the mysterious violin and the lovely Jewess caught in a web of intolerance where her genius must go unrecognized and her spirit remain trapped forever in both a real and metaphysical ghetto.<br /><br />As Daniel becomes more aware of his role in this ancient drama and emerges triumphant to conquer his devil, Lorenzo reveals his own very human desires, and succumbs to that which he fears the most.<br /><br />Hewson does a wonderful job of recreating that mystery of corrupt sophistication that so intrigue all visitors to La Serenissima.  His descriptions of the Jewish ghetto and the worldy resignation of its inhabitants horrify almost as much as his denouement of both characters and the woman in their lives thrills.unrecognized and her spirit remain trapped forever in both a real and metaphysical ghetto.   <br /> <br />As Daniel becomes more aware of his role in this ancient drama and emerges triumphant to conquer his devil, Lorenzo reveals his own very human desires, and succumbs to that which he fears the most. <br /> <br />Hewson does a wonderful job of recreating that mystery of corrupt sophistication that so intrigue all visitors to La Serenissima.

Called by Sir Arthur Evans, the Minoans, little is known about this ancient yet advanced society who as far back as 1680 BC actually had such modern innovations as the first drainage system with flush toilets.  More importantly, these people had created a system of  non-aggressive egalitarianism with religious and sexual freedom that has yet to be rivaled in our so-called modern age of equal rights and tolerance.<br /><br />Although the writings of these sea people have not as yet been deciphered by historians, Hand makes good use of the religious interpretation of scholars with regard to the meanings behind the pottery, frescoes and other artifacts that have been unearthed on Crete and its satellite island of Santorini to reconstruct the lives of these first civilians of Western Civilization.  She weaves a rather intricate cautionary tale of a peaceful weapon-free society challenged by its more aggressive and bellicose mainland neighbors who under the guise of religious differences covet the Keftian's wealth.<br /><br />Epitomizing the almost stubborn reluctance to change the Law of the land in order to halt the encroachment of the Achean mainlanders is Leesander, a maiden/wannabe temple priestess whose sensitive telepathy with the maternal Goddess figure enables her to hear the sacred voice of the Great Mother that leads her to a life in the great temple at Knossos. By her side is Alektrion, seafarer, childhood friend and eventual lover who wisely believes that only through military attack can Keftiu be saved.  Through their concurrent narratives, Leesander and Alek plunge the reader into their separate realms; we participate in the intense training Leesander undergoes as a temple priestess from her initiation into the ancient women's mysteries, to the significance of the Cretan bull dance, and to the inner sanctum of the Mother's womb, where like the Pythia of Delphi, the Goddess speaks under the haze of the poppy.  Alektrion's vital masculinity and questionable half-breed status allows us to roam the wine dark seas with the more objective eyes of one confused of his status and place in a society unwilling to convince itself of its own imminent demise.<br /><br />The love story between the two is secondary; Hand neatly builds up to their happenstance re-acquaintance at a good moment in the story although the use of the cave in the rain may be perceived by those a bit jaded as typical romance genre tedium.  The real genius of this tale is the recreation of an ancient world of both the male and the feminine essences and its almost metaphorical leaning towards the history being constructed today.<br /><br />For although perhaps not intended, Hand's sorry story of envy and cultural distrust can be seen in the wake of 9-11 as a metaphor for  impending disaster if the lessons of such a history are not heeded in our more modern world.  The natural disasters of 1680 BC depicted in the novel, when the island of Kalliste (Santorini) exploded, causing earthquakes, days of black rain and a tsunami the size of which Southeast Asia recently experienced in all its  fury, can certainly be appreciated by those of us living in the Gulf where the devestation wreaked by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will hopefully cause those in authority to reevaluate their proud, stubborn and out-moded fiefdoms of power to better protect the infrastructure of such no-brainer staples as communication and safety that must support the people in the future.<br /><br />Recommended to all who enjoy dreaming of ancient lands with an eye to understanding the present and to anyone who just likes a good story built from a foundation of good references.er's womb, where like the Pythia of Delphi, the Goddess speaks under the haze of the poppy.

Adroitly recreating the Cold War era, it also hints of the former majesty of the opulent Ottoman Empire with its secret societies that more that helped its Sultan gain a foothold in the Balkans and onwards towards Vienna.<br /><br />However, like the suppressed political ideologies the book depicts, all the carefully planned details and skillfully drawn secondary personalities ultimately cannot support the book's rather bald main theme:  the historical Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, undestroyed by Van Helsing and Co. as chronicled in the Bram Stoker classic, lives to find fresh blood not just to sustain himself, but for a purpose I will not disclose for those readers who really must have the desire to plough through \\"The Historian's\\" 600 plus pages.<br /><br />And blood is exactly what this rendition of Dracula sorely needs.  Kostova's Dracula barely makes an appearance and when he does, all of the sensuality and allure that have become trademark attributes of vampirism from as far back as Bela Ligosi's ever-important portrayal and successfully epitomized by the likes of Gary Oldman, Frank Langella, Christopher Lee, Brad Pitt, and their ilk, has been drained by Kostova's rather stodgy treatment.  Here long life has endowed our Vlad the Impaler with as much soulful motivation as a Wall Street day trader.<br /><br />As the age old battle between immortality and damnation does not even come into play here, the moody, harried and dolorous Bram Stoker-ish atmosphere that Kostova does manage to convey to the reader comes off as a black, white and grey stage setting akin to that used in the 70s Broadway play starring Frank Langella.  Back then, the blood red of that Dracula's cape lining suggested something mystical and mysterious that acted as a lure to his victims.  It called to the audience with its timeless romantic charisma of forever life and promised non-stop physical sensuality that went well beyond human.<br /><br />Kostova's characters demonstrate only the horror of contact with such a creature.  Dracula's bites and those of his minions are not the lazy sensuous soul kisses of men who have the time for a forever courtship or the contemplation of the meaning of life.  Rather they are razor sharp jabs of the rapier, quick and pesky mosquito bites with no such attached longings or thoughts of maybe immortality.  The slow search for the soul and its ensuing magnetism that spawned a generation of Forever Knight fans and Anne Rice's LeStat lovers is scoured clean until this well-read and well-intentioned Impaler becomes a musty old pair of easily dismissed bat wings that neither snare nor scare.audience with its timeless romantic charisma of forever life and promised non-stop physical sensuality that went well beyond human.  <br /> <br />Kostova's characters demonstrate only the horror of contact with such a creature.

Montignac, a long-time proponent of eating real food as opposed to processed junk, urges us to forego the old dieting adage of counting calories and all the newer macro nutritional phobias with regard to too much or too little fat, protein or carbohydrates and instead analyze each food choice with an eye on the food's metabolic reaction with regard to fast and easy bloat-free digestion and elimination.<br /><br />Rose agrees, emphasizing that whereas natural foods are easily recognizable by the body and therefore easily broken down, utilized and eliminated, the processed foods that make up so much of the typical American diet are deemed by the body as the worst kind of illegal aliens that sadly deteriorate into waste that the body can neither utilize nor expel.  Waste in this case, has no other recourse than to morph into a variety of problems like weight gain, a degeneration of the organs, a slowing of the metabolism and premature aging.<br /><br />By utilizing a method of food combining where mixing foods in different categories is verboten, similar to that of the  Montignac method (minus the glycemic index factor), Rose further expands this theory by grouping nuts - an iffy category on most food combining plans (Somersizing immediately springs to mind) - as a separate category (starches, fleshes and fruits being the other three categories) , to be combined only with dried fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />She provides an extremely helpful hierarchy of eleven types of quick exit foods, where level number 1, the best, contains fruits and vegetables and level number 11, the worst, contains chemicals and artificial colorings and sweeteners.  She adds that as eating from quick exit levels 1-8 is doable by everyone; the higher levels of health will be reached when eating only from levels 1-5.  In addition an indispensable transitional food grocery list is included to provide brand name items that act as substitutes for mainstream comfort foods that must be eliminated to insure success on this program.  She is not a big fan of dairy and as expected pans the consumption of power shakes and bars.  Surprisingly she eschews the current 'soy is nirvana' bandwagon, labelling soy products as mucus-forming poisons. Neutral foods, those which may be eaten with any category except fruit  include such treats as nut milks, 70% chocolate, olivess and olive oil.  how refreshing! Way to go, Ms Rose!<br /><br />On the practical side, the book abounds with menu plans, recipes, and suggestions on what to eat in a restaurant or at social occasions.  For the aspiring raw foodist, separate chapters are dedicated to detoxifying all aspects of your lifestyle including your bathroom, your living space, your kitchen, your family, fasting, traveling, holidays and your colon.<br /><br />I emailed Ms Rose with questions that pertained to the diet as juxtaposed with my lifestyle and was extremely pleased that the author very pleasantly answered all my questions promptly and professionally and made suggestions that I was able to implement quite easily.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Ms Rose achieves the impossible, a raw food diet that doesn't force you to eat only raw foods, but urges you to discover your own lifestyle at your own pace for achieving optimal health.  With a combination of guidelines, recipes and a fresh common sense five part transitional approach, Ms Rose sends you out into unknown territory, with the option of staying on one particular phase of thediet for as long as you wish.	2005-06-09
US	53093124	R1CP5EXEMK22JQ	1576872513	819190540	The Karl Lagerfeld Diet	Books	3	163	165	N	Y	Strict Caloric Intake Based Plan	Dr Jean-Claude Houdret, architect of the Spoonlight (his supplement brand name) program -- renamed here \\"the Karl Lagerfeld Diet\\" after the famous haute couture designer lost over 88 pounds and maintained a weight that enabled him to wear clothing that he had last worn when he was 18 years old -- advocates a simple-to-understand but perhaps difficult-to-implement regime of three phases where the emphasis is eating mainly protein and certain vegetables and maximizing muscle retention by adding his pre packaged protein supplements.  Mr. Lagerfeld freely comments throughout this pleasantly formatted book in blue-fonted asides, relaying dieting tips and offering support in the form of his own personal experience complete with line drawings, photographs and even a poster summarizing the plan to hang in your kitchen pantry door.<br /><br />Speaking strictly from a practical level, as certain phases of this diet rely on substituting Dr. Houdret's protein supplements for actual meals, -- Dr Houdret's dieting concept hinges on the fact  that the unhealthy loss of muscle mass during weight loss can be avoided by adding extra protein to each meal -- this diet plan may not be feasible simply because the Spoonlight product is not easily obtained.  That is not to say that Houdret does not advocate the consumption of real food - the recipes that make up the bulk of this book require great seasonal ingredients.  These actual meals debut in the second phase of the plan and their frequency increases as reliance on the protein sachets decreases in phase 3---  But don't get confused and think that this is just a recant of other recent European idea imports like  \\"the French Fallacy\\", the \\"Montignac Method\\" or \\"French Women Don't Get Fat,\\"that advocate enjoying real food in limited quantities.  Houdret's Spoonlight program, while heavy on the protein, limits fat intake to almost nothing and recommends only eating carbs in the form of most green vegetables.  Dried fruit, peas, dry beans and lentils are not allowed.  Neither are cheese or dairy products unless their fat content remains within the 0% to 20% range.  The usual top offenders of white flour, pasta, rice, chocolate and sugar remain taboo on this plan.<br /><br />Houdret warns that there will be some physical and mental discomfort on the most limited phase of the plan and requires further supplementation that runs the gamut of a general cocktail of vitamins and minerals to natural hunger suppressants, cactus extracts, doses of ginseng and yarrow and a metabolism balancer consisting of spirulina, chromium yeast and lithotamus.  All are packaged by the good doctor and sold on his website.<br /><br />On a nuts and bolts level, Phase I of the diet consists of consuming only 800 to 900 calories a day and is only suggested while under the care of a monitoring physician. This level which is recommended for only 2 weeks consists of Spoonlight protein sachets ingested with 8 ounces of vegetables, three times a day.  As a less aggressive starting point, Level II is not as depriving (1000- 1200 calories per day) , with slightly more variety on the protein intake as you are allowed a fish, poultry or meat choice in the evening rather than the mandatory protein sachets consumed at breakfast and lunch.  I found Houdret's suggestion of following up a meal with some low-fat cheese or yogurt interesting as well as timely in light of study results that find low fat dairy beneficial for weight loss and disease prevention.  Level III allows the participant to consume 1200 to 1600 calories a day with the addition of whole wheat toast at breakfast and fruit following dinner in the evening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  As this plan seems to incorporate low-fat, low carb and protein balance into one minimalist plan, I can't see how you could not lose weight, especially if the strict guideline of meal replacement fits into  a busy schedule that does not allow for time to think let alone plan or eat a good healthy meal.  On the other hand, even though I found some of Houdret's less conventional dietary no-nos food for thought and plan on experimenting with them in my own eating plan, I don't want to spend most of my food budget on consuming proteins packets and supplements instead of real food.  I would rather learn how to eat right for the long term without having to rely on a quick pre-packaged fix.good healthy meal.

Eat real food with a low average glycemic index.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Montignac's theories which were rather flagrantly adapted over ten years ago by the creators of the Sugarbusters regime and Suzanne Somers' Somersizing system and worked over to create million dollar dieting empires replete with how-to books, recipes, web sites, food products and a variety of other spin-offs including teeth whitening agents,  will appreciate this compact volume that spits out the dieting principles in a minimum of pages, succinctly explains why the diet will work for life and facilitates even the most unimaginative dieter with complete menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner with accompanying recipes.<br /><br />In the mid-eighties, Montignac wrote \\"Dine Out and Lose Weight,\\" in sympathy for business people everywhere like himself that had gained too much weight from heavy business dinners and couldn't see a way to remain polite without the need of going up a waist size.  Simply stated, he forbid the consumption of high glycemic carbohydrates with fats and proteins, explaining that the insulin release from increased blood sugar levels stores the fats ingested rather than burns them for energy.  Montignac Method meals then, were either carbohydrate based or protein/fat based.  Only on the maintenance phase of the diet were some lower glycemic carbohydrates allowed to ride side-car with their fattier macronutritional counterparts.  Strictly forbidden on any phase were the usual suspect high-glycemic demons of sugar, white flour and other processed foods.<br /><br />In \\"The French Diet,\\" Montignac no longer seems caught up with adhering to his former strict dichotomy between carbs and fats.  Now refreshingly, he turns his attention on the concept of GO or glycemic outcome as an explanation of the so-called French Paradox.  Roughly speaking, GO takes an \\"average\\" look at the glycemic index of the entire meal, rather than its individual components.  For example, eating a potato (admittedly a bad example as potatoes are forbidden on phase 1) with a high GI should be balanced with the consumption of really low glycemic, high fiber vegetables, keeping the entire GO to a level of 50 or less.  For Montignac, keeping a meal at a GO level of less than 35 will result in weight loss.  Anything above 50 will start packing that fat back into its favorite storage location -- your abdomen.<br /><br />In addition, he throws out standard nutritional definitions categorizing carbs as either slow of fast burning, refuses to believe that caloric input and output (in the form of exercise) monitors weight loss or gain and adheres strictly to the premise that selecting foods based on their nutritional value and the effects they have on metabolism is the secret to maintaining one's weight for life.  Under Montignac's plan, carbs are no longer public enemy number one and fats, the bad boys of the AHA regime are, no surprise, great if they are either omega 3 or monounsaturated fatty acids-saturated fats are used sparingly and trans fats are a no-no.  As expected, proteins should be selected by origin - the best choices, of course, being fish, chicken, turkey, etc.  Foods labeled as `funky'(combinations of carbs and fats like nuts and tofu) by similar food combining plans are thankfully no longer `funky' on this one.<br /><br />If you thought \\"French Women Don't Get Fat,\\" fun to read, but contained little dieting tenets, you will like Montignac's \\"The French Diet\\".  His easy-to-understand format feeds into the American need for empiricism with  just enough layman friendly science backed by hard facts and medical studies.  The bottom line?  Following a balanced diet of real food while tweaking the glycemic index to your best interest puts all current dietary fads to shame.t of real food while tweaking the glycemic index to your best interest puts all current dietary fads to shame.	2005-05-03

Rather than pay dear prices for some of the wonderfully textured yarns out there without a clue to how they are going to work up, purchasing a book like this aids you in almost every way.<br /><br />Authors Schreier and Kimmelstiel show you the basics in an illustrated introduction -- their instructions on double knitting is wonderful for those who want to make those professinal looking scarf projects where both sides are reversible-- and then move on to chapters focusing on today's latest textures, like cashmere, eyelash, fur,suede, lattice, ribbon, sequins, silk, and old favorites like wool, angora and mohair.<br /><br />Because of the beauty of the texture created, a little goes a long way: all of the projects cited in the book are small ones: scarves, shawls, gauntlets, purses and caps.  Each of the projects is worked in two types of yarn sets--one to show a more evening look and the other a daytime one.  One only has to look once at the \\"Black Tie Wrap\\",  the \\"Trellis Stole\\" or the \\"Ribbon Wrapped Scarf and Shawl\\", to know that texture alone rules the day.<br /><br />Simple patterns show off these magnificient yarns to full effect -- with the right yarns sophisticated creations are only two sticks and a few hours away.  Now that I own the book, does anyone out there know where to get such lovely yarn at even lovelier (lower than knit store) prices?	2005-04-24
US	53093124	R3MKT5S0NQ7V25	1400053250	553681170	Suzanne Somers' Slim and Sexy Forever: The Hormone Solution for Permanent Weight Loss and Optimal Living	Books	3	91	101	N	N	For Somers, Bioidentical Hormones are the Answer	Although Somersizing seems to be nothing more than a more mainstream version of the ten-year old New Orleans based Sugarbusters program  and France's popular Montignac Method - I use the adjective \\"mainstream\\" only because in terms of sheer volume (this is the fifth Somersizing book, not including paperbacks solely dedicated to testimonials and favorite recipes of devotees of the diet)  and television exposure, Ms Somers certainly and admirably seems to know how to harness and utilize the power of the media to inform the public of the choices available within her dieting empire.  Making free usage of her Somersizing fan base to procure dozens of testimonials replete with before and after photos, and very cleverly incorporating them in a chapter dedicated just to allowing her public to speak doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />That said, this latest volume follows the familiar and successful format of the other books:  chatty prose, recipes, cute line drawings of Suzanne Somers-like blondes in various stages of dieting awareness and progression, candid black and white shots of family and friends glossy photographs of attractive Somers groupings partaking of equally attractive and seductive groupings of appetizers, entrees and desserts.  As Somers recommends using fresh ingredients, eschews eating high glycemic carbohydrates and forbids the intake of additives, preservatives, corn syrup and trans-fats, I can not fault her overall dieting concept in any way.  The three hour hiatus between meals puts the breaks on the desire to snack on anything other than fruit.<br /><br />Although Somersizing does not eliminate any of the basic food groups, it does promote the idea familiar to all those fans of the Montignac method - that of eating proteins and fats together along with low glycemic vegetables separately from higher glycemic carbohydrates in the form of legumes and whole grains.  On this first phase of the diet, there is no limit to amount and I can attest to two facts:  your digestive system will be pleased with the lack of bloating and discomfort and you will lose weight.  On the second (maintenance) phase, Somers allows some denser carbs to be combined with proteins and fats, but then limits the portion size of the entire meal.  Bottom line:  eat the way suggested in the latest diets (like Fat Fallacy, Martini Diet, Volumetrics or French Women Don't Get Fat) that advocate eating real food in moderation and you are set.<br /><br />The difference in this volume is Somers' focus on the aging baby boomer and his/her depletion of youth retaining hormones.  If strictly following the Somersizing tenets does not result in weight loss, she claims, the failure is due to an imbalance of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, HGH,  etc.,  and can be measured by either blood or saliva testing.  As covered in her other book, \\"The Sexy Years\\", Somers tackles the difference between her preferred homones of choice: bioidentical hormones made from soy and wild yam and synthetic hormones prescribed by most doctors and demonized in 2002 Woman's Health Initiative Study and if anything will bring to the forefront that not all medical doctors prescribing synthetic hormones for relief of menopausal symptoms are savvy with regard to alternative compounded pharmaceuticals.  Perhaps, if this option is not available to you in your corner of America, thanks to this book and other books about the use of natural hormone replacement, that compound pharmacy may just move into your neighborhood just a little bit faster.<br /><br />Somers also talks about adrenal burnout (serotonin depletion) and the over-secretion of the stress hormone cortisol with relation to weight gain.  Again balancing the diet, getting plenty of sleep and avoiding anti-depressants seems to be the common sense Rx for these issues along with some deep thinking about one's overall purpose in life.  In relation to this, Suzanne touches on other dieting FYIs:  she will tell you why the lowcarb lifestyle is not the ultimate answer for long term health, and  how to jump off that dieting plateau with suggestions and tips that seem more psychological (isn't it always) than tactical.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you loved Suzanne Somers other weight control books, you certainly will like this one.  Yes, as in the other books, some of the dieting information is redundant - each of the books can stand alone.  However, with 100 new recipes, all emphasizing using real foods, you really can't go wrong.  There is a chapter dedicated to selling Suzanne's pre-packaged wonders - sauces, rubs, marinades - you name it.  Great -- if you want to make an extra purchase, but not obnoxious enough to write off as being overly commercial. Does Suzanne look as great in the flesh as in the beautiful photos in the book?  Who knows?  The real issue is whether or not you are willing to try synthesized bioidentical hormones or not, especially after reading Suzanne's comments about having a period for the rest of your life.  She provides factual grist for your mill-you make the ultimate decision.ll you why the low carb lifestyle is not the ultimate answer for long term health, and  how to jump off that dieting plateau with suggestions and tips that seem more psychological (isn't it always) than tactical. <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you loved Suzanne Somers other weight control books, you certainly will like this one.

Think about southern France until your mouth waters with culinary expectation and then turn to any page in this book for a perfectly lovely explanation or recipe of the gastronomical treats that await you.  Wells covers a variety of topics that more than amply seduce the reader to discover each and every one of them individually and in the only way possible -- by visiting France and enjoying its simple pleasures first-hand or by enrolling in one of Ms. Wells' cooking adventures as advertised on her informative website.<br /><br />The 300+ page book presents a smorgasbord of earthy Mediterrean food that ranges from appetizers, salads, and soups to fish, poultry, rabbit and meat with sides of pasta, rice, grains, vegetables, potatoes, eggs, cheese, bread and finishes with dessert.  Each recipe is prefaced or enhanced by a one of Wells' personal stories, a recount of a Provencal tradition, the history of a merchant or restauranteur or the background of a particular wine or herb. A wine suggestion follows complete with information about the wine and its availability.<br /><br />For sure, the ideas in this book are meant to be executed with only the finest ingredients and complimented with an array of local wines. Unfortunately, for an American audience with limited access to such luxuries as butcher shop meat/poultry selections, market fresh vegetables and fruit, truffles or Moulin-Cornille huile d'olive, the results may not be the burst of simple flavor that stresses the taste of the food itself that Wells intends.  Inferior produce, lackluster condiments and grocery store meat cuts may need that extra zing of a complicated preparation to be more fully satisfying.<br /><br />However, if you find yourself planning a trip to the Midi and new food experiences rate high on your to-do list, utilize the restaurant and merchant names, addresses and telephone numbers and marketplace schedules to formulate a gastronomically elite itinerary that will surely live forever in your taste bud's memory.

Why?  The hormone insulin is most efficient at this time of the day which enables the hypothalamus to flip the neuropeptide Y switch off thereby stopping the body from going into carb-crave overdrive.  At lunchtime, its best to eat what Costain calls \\"alertness\\" food, a balanced combination of proteins, low glycemic carbs and fats which gets the body through the post lunch dip of tiredness and neutralizes the effects of galnin whcich stimulates that afternoon desire for all things fatty. Dinner consists of a prep-for-sleep lighter blend of low glycemic carbohydrates, healthy oils and lean protein.<br />The book also focuses on problem situations of sleeplessness, jet-leg and premenstrual syndrome by including case studies  and the usual common sense Rx of exercise ( to release endorphins  and control cortisol) and the elimination of food no-nos like  caffeine and alcohol.<br /><br />All in all, if you are well-versed in diet literature, you might fnd \\"The Body Clock\\" a bit of a no-brainer, but if you want just  one book with good readable information which includes menus and  uncomplicated recipes, this book may just fit the bill.<br /><br />What I like about this offering is that it promotes the eating of real food.  There are no trick breakfast bars to buy or meals prepared from a box-- in fact there are really no short cuts allowed:  the eating of real food is a must on this plan.  All foods are included -- not one food group is left out in the cold.  Portions are defined for those who are used to a little more supersizing than necessary. Taking a page from the South Beach Diet and the popular French diet, the Montignac plan, the Body Clock plan utilizes the glycemic index to help the dieter make better choices to keep the powerful hormone insulin at bay and hence prevent unwanted fat storage.<br /><br />Bottom line:  None of the information here borders on the extreme or comes as any great revelation; the attractive format of the publication focuses on both vegetarian and non-vegetarian eaters with a full 14 day menu plan for both.  The message, one part common sense and one part science, appeals to the American reader who desires a little more structure complete with portions defined and day-to-day eating plans that a simple memoir like the popular \\"French Woman Don't Get Fat\\" does not provide.t this offering is that it promotes the eating of real food.

Now, in her second tome - utilizing the same lush squatty trade paperback format as the first, Debbie explores what she calls the \\"Stitch N' Bitch\\" Nation, a veritable sorority of knitters from all around the United States.  Simply put, this volume adds the dimension of camaraderie and grafts in a sense of mutually shared satisfaction that every knitter has experienced individually after gazing at his/her finished craft.  Essays from the nation's knitting \\"sisters\\" succeed in generating a newly-found 21st century pride in an update of an age-old tradition as they attempt to explain their fascination with the art of creating a garment or work of art with two sticks and a ball of fancy string.<br /><br />The theme of this common thread runs through the book with the quick and unexpected downward thrust of a wayward ball of yarn.  Stoller garnishes about 50 new and very funky pattern contributions for all knitting aficionados and their ilk ( cats, babies, cars and couches are decked out in knitted splendor)  with lush color photos, diagrams and creator's bios,  and by including fun-to-read tips in highlighted \\"aside\\" format by sisters-of-the-stitch alumni.  Some of my favorites include:  \\"making perfect side to side seams\\", \\"pre-knitual agreement\\" making a nicer decrease,\\" and \\"knitting two pieces at the same time.\\"  Although some of the patterns may not appeal to the traditional knitter, the contributors nonetheless offer a sparkling array of fresher ideas that can be tweaked to produce whatever effects the creator wishes to achieve.  Of note,  Jesse's Flames sweater screams out to knitted for that edgy man in your life or yourself while the Poster Boy tote bag gives a rocker's riff update to the carry-all seen in all major knitting magazines. at least once a season.<br /><br />\\"Stitch N' Bitch Nation\\", while by no means a must purchase- the first Stitch N' Bitch provides all the technical information necessary for you to begin your knitting odyssey, adds a modern stitch to your knitting compendium with its eclectic collection of contemporary ideas that you will not find in most of the publications about the craft.

That said, the author, a medical doctor with a family practice, gives good old-fashioned, albeit limiting, guidelines regarding what to eat and what not to eat.  The idea, simply put, is to avoid foods that God did not create, leaving a wide variety of good clean fruits, vegetables and protein sources, but unfortunately, eliminating wine and other man-made substances that use \\"God-made\\" substances and through fermentation or other processes create other types of \\"illegal\\" foods.<br /><br />While I commend the author on her suggestions to partake of \\"real\\" as opposed to over-processed foods or so-called convenience foods loaded with trans-fats, corn syrup and unnecessary sugars, I think condemning a moderate amount of wine, cheese, bread and yogurt(without preservatives) is excessive.  Perhaps her experience as a family physician, however, indicates that these products may cause some problems which are best handled through avoidance.  She does exemplify her program with case studies that make for a convincing arguemet.<br /><br />The format of this very slim volume is simple to follow--the read a breeze and the message clear.  Just eat real food that has not been tweaked.  You will definitely lose weight and probably feel a lot better feeding your system simple, easy to digest staples although, I would think that eating in such a raw or clean way would make dining in a restaurant a bit difficult.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading diet books that use the Bible more literally, try \\"The Maker's Diet\\" or \\"What Would Jesus Eat\\"  -- both books along with God's Diet are for folks that are tired of figuring out carbs/protein/fat ratios and just want to eat real food.	2005-03-30

Unlike Mireille Guiliano of \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\" fame, author Barbara Rolls has all the right nutrition-savvy credentials, which will definitely appeal to those lifetime strategists needing a nod from the medical community.  As different as Guiliano and Rolls are in terms of in-the-trenches experience, both books have the same message, albeit Guliano's formats hers as a memoir with recipes and Rolls provides a more theoretical approach again with the requisite recipes.<br /><br />During numerous trials, Rolls noticed that despite the macronutrients involved, (the current trend in dieting divides everything into three groups: carbohydrates, protein and fat) people still ate the same amount of food each day.  What was different and what caused people to gain weight was that they ate different caloric amounts.  Rolls realized that since people eat a specific volume of food daily, if they chose foods that would provide that same comfortable volume with less calories and more nutriments, weight loss would be achieved and easy to maintain without calorie counting.<br /><br />Rolls suggests making up a large portion of one's diet with category 1 foods: foods that have fewer calories in a serving than their weight in grams -- most water and fiber rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy product fall into this category. Rolls defines 4 categories, touting also a more expansive enjoyment of category 2 which includes foods with calories equal to or slightly greater than their weight --- ie., fish, chicken without fat or skin, potatoes, pasta, rice, beans, and low-fat salad dressings. The usual suspects like beef, cheese, pretzels, full-fat salad dressings, chips, cookies,ice cream,  bacon, oils, and french fries that have two or more times as many calories as their weight can still be eaten, but need to be controlled.<br /><br />Think of it this way:  if you started off your meal with a fruit salad of sliced apples, strawberries and pineapple slices, you immediately have moved the gauge in your brain's satiety monitor towards the 'full' position.  You have also provided your body with water, fiber and vitamins.  If you followed this starter with a small bowl of soup containing all sorts of vegetables, chicken pieces and stock, you are providing your body a variety of nutrition form different sources.  Finishing with a smaller cut of fish or chicken or whatever, only stands to reason - you are already \\"full\\" and your need to eat more dissovles as your brain registers the fact that you have provided your body enough nutriments.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Common sense epiphany whose positive functionality is demonstrated by years of observation and test studies.  High calorie no-no foods that are usually forbidden on many diets are allowed here in moderation --  carb rich foods that are verboten on high-protein diets like Atkens and South Beach are okay here as the message is similar to the premise in \\"Fremch Women Don't Get Fat\\" and \\"The Fat Fallacy\\" -- eating real food, rich in nutriements and variety provide your body what it needs and fulfils the body's need for satiety.

The face of the dreamy young woman, the Roman soldier looking brash and bold in his armour and helmet give the impression of a typical bodice ripper set in ancient Rome.  Author Michelle Paver, however, achieves a rather nicely paced story set in London and a small town in the French Pyrenees that calls to mind all the emotional tension and misplaced trust of two meant-to-be self-conscious lovers of the early Barbara Taylor Bradford in her story of misunderstandings and manipulations  entitled \\"Voice of the Heart.\\"  Like Bradford's two main characters, Antonia, an archeologist, and Patrick, an American student attending Oxford,  are swept away by an emotional longing the moment they set eyes on each other, but selfish human forces do their utmost to ensure that the pair never quite get together.<br /><br />Paver, successfully, fleshes out a bevy of characters with so many hang-ups and selfish motives that the reader cannot help but believe in their authenticity.  The book's pages seem to turn on their own accord as the reader devours the sophisticated and complex natures of Pavel's universe.<br /><br />Most enjoyable for me was the authors juxtapositioning of the object of Antonia's occupational obsession:  the riddle of Cassius, a Roman poet and soldier whose suicide was prompted by a  failed long-ago love affair that served as the inspiration for his verse but left for posterity the mystery of the woman's identity and the cause of their break-up.  Pavel attains the reader's attention by intermingling her major present-day plot with fist-hand snippets of the Roman tragedy and the zealous and insightful ponderings of Antonia as she puzzles through Cassius' poetry and clues buried deep in historical archives.  Pavel is never pedantic, but she is  academic enough to make the quest seem real.  The reader does guess at the root of the Cassius mystery, but the riddle itself remains unsolved until the very moment present day Antonia and Patrick become enlightened.  This formidable achievement maintains the momentum until the very end - no mean feat -- with just the right amount of emotional response garnered from the reader to make it all a very satisfactory experience.<br /><br />My only critism would be that at times, the happenstance thwarting the present day lovers becomes almost frustrating. Although Pavel does an admirable job of keeping a sense of reality that underlines the inferiority complexes of both the main characters, pages of this negative interplay  could be reworked to include more of the psychological denouement of the characters of Debra, Myles' mother and Imogen, Myles sister.  I would like to hear more about Imogen -- maybe a whole novel's worth about her reconditioning.<br /><br />Otherwise, I commend Ms. Paver for a most enjoyable 2 days of rainy-day reading.  For those purists, this is not great literature with shades of meaning and message.  But when it comes down to it all, as Cassius proclaims in all of his poems, it comes pretty close to what is truely worthwhile in life.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Too bad there is not more access to this author in the US.  I was lucky to have seen this novel written up on Amazon.UK and to pick up one of the only copies inexpensively available on the Amazon Marketplace.  I would love to read Paver's other novels and will when they are made more accessable to the American reader.  In the interim, Ms. Pavel. please write on!day Antonia and Patrick become enlightened.

I found myself engrossed by the story from early on; the details of the police investigation and Alex's frenzied response typifies Case's unique gift of getting the reader to empathize with another of their very human narrators-- a regular guy who either through greed, cleverness or, in this case, simple happenstance, stumbles onto something so macabre and labyrintine, he must uncover a vertitable Da Vinci Code of oddball trivia lore to regain his sons.<br /><br />In this one, the Cases lead us on a merry chase that explores serial killings, magic acts in Las Vegas and occult voodoo practices in Louisiana fascinating, page-turning segments that moves the main character around many US cities while hynotisizing the reader with a wealth of researched information that adds volumes to the credibility of the plot and keeps the old grey matter folding.<br /><br />My main criticism with this novel and with Case's other novels is that the team doesn't maintain the mental momentum.  In \\"Murder Artist\\" in particular, the story works so well on a thinking level that the action of the characters seems a let-down.  The final piece to the mental puzzle should click in as the action winds down so the reader gets a double karate kick on both a sensual and cerebral level.  As with many novels of this genre, once our narrator discovers the trick to the Chinese conundrum, the brain rush shuts off and the actual denouement -- the rescue, in this instance -- always a step or two behind, flails painfully,  almost seeming like a mundane \\"going through the motions\\"  and a telling of boring secondary events the reader doesn't even need to read because the thinking aspect of the character has been switched off. The result?  A  feeling of reader burn-out that after all that research and clever workings, the authors simply do not deserve.<br /><br />Another aspect of the story that I thought needed work was the use of dialogue rather than strict narration to convey key facts on which to build the story's main points of interest.  Dan Brown  succeeds in giving the reader plenty of obscure facts to string together to form an interesting platform from which to jump into the realm of the imagingation; Case tries hard, but the use of dialogue between characters almost comes off as attempting a  nonchalance that comes off as forced.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Good page turner that kept my brain busy until the almost unnecessary action kicks in at the very end.sh shuts off and the actual denouement -- the rescue, in this instance -- always a step or two behind, flails painfully,  almost seeming like a mundane \\"going through the motions\\"  and a telling of boring secondary events the reader doesn't even need to read because the thinking aspect of the character has been switched off.

For me, hibernation means keeping busy, especially at night -- so I whipped out the old knitting needles and checked my store of yarn skeins---my only problem was I was so out of touch with the craft of knitting, I forgot what to do.  I needed a quick and upbeat way to refresh both my mind and fingers.  Enter \\"Stich N' Bitch\\" by Debbie Stoller--I noticed this hardy trade paperback on display at a local store and decided that instead of ploughing through my stash of Vogue Knitting with their complicated patterns and instructions, this book may be just what I was looking for in terms of new and fresh ideas with easy to follow stitch details.  I was so right.  Not only is this book fun to read, it tells you just what you need to know and remember without the bog-down of other more \\"granny\\"-friendly knitting guides.  If I didn't remember how to add a stitch, I just looked it up in the convenient index; when I needed to join to pieces together -- pages of easy-to-read explanatory text with illustrations helped me to pull it all together in a fun way with professional results.  Best of all are the cute patterns -- in particular, the alien scarf and the devil/cat hats.  Really cute and fun and easy to make.<br /><br />Not only did I create lots of great gifts for the coming year -- I actually shaved my yarn supply down to almost nothing -- meaning I can now buy more without feeling guilty!<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is  a fun way to get into a  great life-time craft.  You may still need mom, gran or an aunt to cast-off for you, but I promise you will be soon doing this on your own as your fingers start to fly.	2005-03-02
US	53093124	R1CCKBKQFAC5YN	0446615145	734205902	The Lake House	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Too Much Cooing Bears Heavily on the Wings of this Tale	Does Patterson's sequel to \\"When the Wind Blows\\" FLY, like his fantastically bio-engineered characters with wings?<br /><br />Well. . . the innovative liftoff of the first installment of the bird childrens' story unfortunately can no longer soars as high in this tale which begins with veternarian Frannie O-Neill and FBI-agent Kit Brennan attempting to get custody in a media- saturated trial that rivals the likes of the current Michael Jackson fiasco. Burdened with a repetitive storyline and way too many atta-birds, \\"The Lake House\\" -- a reference to the idyllic dream dovehouse of the bird children -- fails to refeather the nest so wonderfully conceived by Patterson's first foray.<br /><br />As with in first story, Patterson enjoys writing about his wunderkind; soaring descriptions of flight and formation of the \\"flock\\" literally fly off the pages.  But some of his praise quickly gets stale; yes,thank you very much, the reader becomes aware right from the start that the kids' IQs are \\"all off the charts\\". Patterson's  penchant for attempting to narrate from a child's perspective with a child's limited vocabulary also lays an egg; his transition into the more mature voice of vet-lady Frannie remains at the same immature level where the most over-used word of the book is some form of \\"creepy\\". Yet even this juvenile feel rings false when the children chirp songs from another era and relate to pop culture that is surely far older than even the eleven year old elder of the flock.<br /><br />If you can get through these flaws --- and how I wish I didn't have to expend such energy and well, charity on this offering---- Patterson does tell a fast-paced albeit repeat story with some predictable side issues which urge the reader to turn to the next page, or in my case. listen to the next cassette simply because the reader wants to satisfactorily confirm what he believes will coming next.<br /><br />At an attempt at a higher plane, Patterson takes some jabs at today's fixation on the media and his feelings about science running amok, but these ideas although well juxtaposed with his fantasy, are almost lost in the too false and cooing rah-rah enthusiasm of the kids and their almost overly indulgent make-shift parents.<br /><br />The audio edition of this book is well-produced complete with thematic music.  A female and male actor perform the larger roles of Frannie and Dr. Ethan Kane.  Bottom line: if you enjoyed the first book of the series, than by all means, give this one a shot; its okay as a mind-engager while you exercise, but if you are like me, you may find yourself grimacing in pain at the somewhat silly dialogue and hoping that if a third book is in the works, Patterson at least checks to make sure his voices ring with some sense of consistency befitting an imaginery species.and his feelings about science running amok, but these ideas although well juxtaposed with his fantasy, are almost lost in the too false and cooing rah-rah enthusiasm of the kids and their almost overly indulgent make-shift parents.   <br />The audio edition of this book is well-produced complete with thematic music.

I am a big fan of the King Arthur legends, and so when I read the blurb on the back of James A. Hetley's \\"The Summer Country\\", I will admit to being excited.  It seemed the world of Arthur, Merlin and Morgan Le Fey was being explored as a parallel sort of universe in this paperback of around 350+ pages.<br /><br />While the premise is admirable. it falls short in the execution.  Hetley describes the usual Irish American world of bars with free-flowing Guiness and fey fiddling  musicians and their red-haired, green-eyed women.  Maureen and her sister Jo are virtually physical twins, but that's where the similarity ends. While Jo achieves a sexiness that Maureen only dreams about, Maureen runs amok, talking to trees and having hallucinations she thinks are triggered by an abusive event in her earlier life.  When the call to the alternate reality of the Summer Country comes in the brawny package of Brian Pendragon, Maureen and her family find themselves unprepared for the adventure that spirals into the land of eternal green like a quest straight from the pixels of the Legend of Zelda.<br /><br />Does it work?  Not really.  Hetley sets up Maureen in too many semi-nude situations with enough blood and guts to make anyone other than the most adolescent audience a little wary as to its similarity to a Mature rated video game.  While the grittiness of the story does move it along, the characters are neither likeable or disalikable enough for any of them to be memorable.  The Ancient Ones come off more like quarrelling Greek Gods with an Irish flavor rather than immortal beings fighting for control.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Hetley does a nice job in the side story of sister  Jo and her musician boyfriend who unwittingly get involved with some potent green magic that proves to be a little too tough for them to handle.  Even so, I would have liked to have put this story in the hands of Elizabeth Hand of \\"Mortal Love\\" fame, who does some wonderful things with language while contemporalizing myth and maintaining a fey air that cannot be and needs not be comprehended.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Entertaining in a video game genre that could have had much more dimension.zing myth and maintaining a fey air that cannot be and needs not be comprehended.   <br />Bottom line:  Entertaining in a video game genre that could have had much more dimension.	2005-02-16

On the last night festivities, she appeared in the dining room in an elegant dress that was at least 30 years old, but one which displayed her still attractive figure and proclaimed to the world that the wearer had maintained her weight and her proportions for at least the age of the dress. She epitomized the old adage of growing old gracefully. I asked her what her secret was, and quite simply she told me that she tasted a little of everything, but never finished whatever she sampled.  When I thought back to the meals I had shared with her on board the ship, I realized that she indeed had appeared with plates peppered with goodies from the various buffet tables -- desserts included---she would take a little bite from whatever gave her pleasure, trill over each savoury mouthfull and then taste something else.  In a cruise situation, where food overflows from every table nearly every hour of the day, she never wiped her plate clean as everyone of my generation was taught to do with the constant parental reminder of those \\"starving children\\" who weren't lucky enough to have the good fortune of three full meals a day like we were.  There wasn't any guilt involved when it came to nurturing her palate; she ate what she wanted, but never walked away from any banquet table with that horrible \\"I-ate-too-many-mashed-potatoes\\" apres Thanksgiving dinner feeling that borders on utter gluttony.<br /><br />When I read Mireille Guiliano's memoir and lifestyle regime, \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\", memories of Viviane, the intrepid world-explorer and cruise gourmand instantly flashed through my thoughts.  Mireille Guiliano's common sense advise echoes older Viviane's  food sentiments exactly.  Viviane would never crowd her system with too many potatoes or bread; she left ample room for what her body really needed:  good nutritious foods topped off with a mildly sweet finish.  Feeling stuffed would destroy the sensory pleasure one gets from food and at the same time  stops our bodies from receiving nutriments it needs from a wider variety of food sources. Makes sense, right?<br /><br />After a constant barrage of 30-40-30 ratios, low-fat or carb-consciousness, for this concept to fully register requires one to understand that when the body receives what it needs to function optimally, it needs far less of that nutriment than one would think.  If you eat a huge steak dinner and nothing else a la the low carb craze, your body still yearns for something else -- maybe some vegetables, maybe some grain, some fruit . . . Guiliano simply restates what every grandmother knew intrinsically -- give your body what it needs in small but adequate proportions and it will work for you not against you.<br /><br />On the technical level, the author provides no menu plan of the proper carb, fat and protein ratio; she wants to eat food. And so she merely make suggestions exemplified with family stories from her childhood of how to get the most pleasure out of every bite.  She suggests eating seasonally, meaning buying fresh produce from farms when the produce is at its peak and actually cooking, allowing all those fresh flavors to permeate your home so that all your senses are engaged throughout the day.  A delicious fresh picked early summer strawberry packs a lot of flavor when compared to a fruit frozen and flown in from some other state or country.  Eating better food means eating less -- your contentment level is obtained far faster. She suggests soup as a great way to incorporate great flavor with many different types of nutrition.  Making yogurt without the preservatives and added sugars, experimenting with different seasonings, and searching for quality rather than quantity while shopping, are some of the helpful suggestions to be incorporated in your life, allowing you to have your cake and actually eat it too -- all without gaining a kilo.<br /><br />On a more nuts and bolts level, Mme. Guiliano's one dieting stipulation is that you assess your eating habits to discover in what food item you are over-indulging. Her Rx? A weekend of leek soup to kick-start your new lifestyle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a plan with specific measurements and combinations, you will not receive one here, albeit the author does suggest using a small scale to better acquaint oneself with  smaller portion sizes and does provide some examples of seasonal menus.<br /><br />If you are tired of the dieting yo-yo; of figuring out the balance of carb to fat to protein and just want to eat real food that actually tastes good, do purchase Mme. Guiliano's book.  If you are already familiar with Will Clowder's Fat Fallacy or  enjoyed the dolce vita-like existence of Arbor in \\"Joie De Vivre\\", you will nod your head in agreement while reading \\"French Women Don't Ger Fat\\".  \\"The Martini Diet\\" and the \\"Chic and Slim\\" series also commend the same approach.  They all urge you to take a page from Viviane's stylish notebook:  limit your intake, but  don't censor yourself from enjoyment.  The reward?  Sliding into that thirty year old classic sheath with no snagging zippers!On a more nuts and bolts level, Mme.

Agreed, this is not a literary masterpiece filled with innuendo and angst making the big statement about humanity in the 21st century.  But, it does intrigue with its snipets of information, some commonplace, some obscure regarding topics of a wide-ranging spectrum.  I admit to wondering what adventure Langdon will get up to in the next installment --- hopefully Brown has not quite made enough money on this novel's record sales to retire nicely in a villa that resembles a mini Versailles.<br /><br />In this edition, Brown includes some wonderful full color facsimiles of the art, architecture and historical personages mentioned in the novel, adding that old \\"one picture is worth a thousand words\\" extra that piques the reader's interest just that much more. Instead of saving you moments of search time on the web, the tantalizing images reproduced in this book will motivate you to find out more.  The edition includes the original text of the novel liberally intersperced with photos and reprints all printed on lovely artbook stock.  A wonderful holiday gift for the conspiracy theorist in your family.	2004-12-02

Although he can envision her pale face and smoldering eyes gracing each of his macabre death-themed canvases, he cannot seem to view her as an adult woman with emotions or desires.  In fact, Henry seems to have many quirks regarding women in general stemming from childhood fixations on religion, purity and his mother and validated by the trend by physicians of the time to label women as hysterics and dose them with laudanum.  Even though Effie plays the role of helpless child, addressing her husband as \\"Mr. Chester\\", sitting on his knee and unwillingly taking her \\"medicine\\", Henry continues to be annoyed as well as frustrated, frequenting the bordello he used before he was married.<br /><br />To set the plot along its gruesome path towards the supernatural and murder mixed with the usual gothic touches, Harris injects into this unhealthy marriage another strange couple: the roguish Mose,  a gentleman with ungentlemanly habits and the malevolent Fanny, the bordello owner whose desire to avenge her young daughter's death changes the foursome's lives forever with disastrous and ironic side effects<br /><br />Not as compelling as Harris' more recent offerings, \\"Sleep, Pale Sister\\" nonetheless has its moments where the author's skill for creating unforgettably unscrupulous characters shines through despite the murky backdrop and sound effects necessary to recall the foggy gothic London of Jack the Ripper fame.  Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view and your desire to read \\"Holy Fools\\", the two most interesting characters, Mose and Fanny are given less a voice than Henry and Effie---Harris employs the technique of using different first person voices to relate turning points in the story from various perspectives---as she later uses to a fuller fruition in \\"Holy Fools\\" where the character of Mose becomes more fully fleshed out as the redeemable Le Merle and Fanny takes on a younger, less harsh and more romantic persona in the character Juliet.  Look also for Harris' more familiar themes of the unconventional versus the conventional and the role of magic, superstition and tarot readings to add spice to otherwise straightforward situations --- all features that kick the story up a notch in that way that Harris' fans have grown to love and expect from her.<br /><br />Read \\"Sleep, Pale Sister\\" only if you are true believer in the almost lost art of the Gothic novel or if you enjoy reading anything by Joanne Harris.g characters, Mose and Fanny are given less a voice than Henry and Effie---Harris employs the technique of using different first person voices to relate turning points in the story from various perspectives---as she later uses to a fuller fruition in \\"Holy Fools\\" where the character of Mose becomes more fully fleshed out as the redeemable Le Merle and Fanny takes on a younger, less harsh and more romantic persona in the character Juliet.

I can only think that when author Grossman finished his novel \\"Codex\\" and delivered it to his publisher, his publisher called in the editors and a larger, more cohesive novel was whittled down to blockbuster sales size.  Yes, I am being kind, but I think that there is definite potential in this fairly short read that revolves around a young career-in doubt investment banker turned private librarian with an after-hours penchant for role-playing computer games.  Yet the pages within the pressed board simply leaves out too much information to make the book work in a satisfying way on as many levels as Grossman might have intended.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for the reader, Grossman starts off shakily, asking the unaskable:  suspend belief on common sense without any preparation---at least give us a \\"Once Upon a Time\\".  He isn't really clear about why Edward is lured into the geek world of role-playing when he is scheduled to begin a new and improved level of employment at his firm's London office within weeks.  Neither are we told why he decides to roll up his sleeves and begin unwrapping the private book collection of the fabulously wealthy Duke and Duchess instead of just getting on with his 2 week vacation. Grossman does such an enthusiastically entertaining job of characterizing the assortment of counterculture computer nerds who gather around empty pizza boxes and diet Coke cans that I get the sense that the same detail was or should have been afforded to the rest of the narrative.  Perhaps in the unedited version of \\"Codex\\", Edward's life better parallels the mysterious codex or medieval novel that he is told to find and the sense of time-wasted within the cyberworld better alludes to the sense of redundancy in the land of Cimmeria and the waffling Edward does with his own life goals.  If only the reader had been allowed to soak in that dreamy quality and become as addicted to Edward's further discoveries inside and outside reality as Edward is to his gameplaying inside and outside his own reality.<br /><br />Grossman has his moments:  the discovery of the actual codex parallels nicely with Edward's growing awareness of the powers-that-be who control the MOMUS game.  His characters don't ponder to death the obvious like they do in many of the other popular \\"let's find the hidden message in the ancient/medieval/Renaissance text\\" literary offerings of the last few years.  Discoveries happen at a fairly believable rate which the reader hardly has time to figure out beforehand. Bravo on this aspect of the novel!<br /><br />The ending, however, left much to be desired.  More detail may have made it more understandable.  But I would have liked more of a connection paralleling the message secreted by the medieval author and Edward's life--not just its relation to the cyberworld of the game.<br /><br />Bottom line:  \\"Codex\\" has potential, but it seems more an outline to a much bigger more complicated book that could have been a real cult classic rather than the muddled 300+ page literary thriller that it is marketed as.ide and outside his own reality.   <br />Grossman has his moments:  the discovery of the actual codex parallels nicely with Edward's growing awareness of the powers-that-be who control the MOMUS game.

With her short chapter format, Clark tempts the reader to read just one more page that leads to one more chapter and before the reader knows it, he/she is so hooked that he/shee needs to figure out who the guilty party is before turning in for the night.<br /><br />\\"On the Street Where You Live\\" is a beach reader's dream.  Higgins Clark successively toys with the idea of a dual murder set in a lovely summer hamlet in New Jersey at the turn of the century---asking the question if somehow the soul of the murderer found its way into a modern day persona, how would modern sensibilities fueled by present day forensic techniques deal with the horrendous repercussions of another set of murders?<br /><br />As in her other offerings, Higgins Clark keeps you guessing as to the identity of the murderer---and there are many would-bes from which to choose.  As with many of her tales, that last defining act which leads us to discover the murderer's identity hinges on a systematic plan to do away with an attractive young professional woman and some last minute bad calls by the police and the gentlemen interested in the clueless target.<br /><br />Similar in technique to her other novels, Higgins Clarks doesn't throw us any curve balls, just delivers what she has come to be known for---a good tale of suspense which keeps one guessing until the end.  Just don't expect any of the characters to leap out on the page at you---Clark deals more in building a story around a media event current day issue rather than delivering a more subtle univeral message. Great quick airport read.	2004-10-18

A huge tome of over a 1000 pages, this earlier novel relates the story of Arthur and his Camelot from the perspective of the three women closest in his life: his mother Ygraine, his sister, Morgaine and his wife, Guinevere.  believe me this is a novel to be savored and reread many times.  That being said, I was excited when Zimmer Bradley came out with her two prequels, firstly, \\"The Forest House\\" and \\"Lady of Avalon\\".  Sadly, neither of these two books are worthy enough to complete a trilogy, but if you, like myself, were intigued by the idea of a closed society of people using magic to effect the early history of Britain, you will also grudgingly like these.<br /><br />\\"Lady of Avalon\\" starts off where \\"Forest House\\" left off.  In order to span the gulf between the time sequence of Forest House and Mists of Avalon, Bradley scrambles a bit and tells the story of three different generations of Avalon high priestesses.  How disappointing . . . each of these vignettes would have made a wonderful more fully fleshed out novel of its own.  Granted, each of the women are strong and they all have their particular mission with regard to Avalon with respect to the outside world.  However detailed certain acts of magic are within storyline, Zimmer Bradley's own sparkling brand of magic so evident in \\"Mists\\" is unfortunately missing. But one postive note:  however disappointing this trilogy of tales is, it still continues the tradion of Zimmer Bradley's brainchild and it is supremely better than Diana Paxson's sequel called \\"Priestess of Avalon\\" which cannot hold a candle to Zimmer Bradley's work.<br /><br />I both read the book and listened to the audio performance; the abridged version leaves far too much out to be considered serious.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who simply love Zimmer Bradley's interpretation of the Arthurian tales and must have more.	2004-09-09

She does an admirable job, creating a cast of characters that inspire, conceive and successfully execute these beautiful weavings to perfection.<br /><br />Behind it all is Nicolas des Innocentes, a woman's court minaturist with more than a lustful eyes for the ladies.  Commissioned to create a battle scene, he convinces his patron to approve of a series of panels depicting the famed story of a woman seducing a unicorn.  For Nicholas, the story is one he tells often in baudy double entendre meant to seduce the daughter of the house of his patron.  Claude, the intended victim, falls precariously to his charms, but before Nicholas has the opportunity to sow this one wild oat, Genevieve, Claude's mother, finds a way to move Claude safely out of Nicholas' sights.<br /><br />Instead Nicholas finds himself in Brussels, where the second cast of characters, the family of Georges de la Chappelle,  explains their part in the creation of the tapestries and the influence the appearance of Nicholas des Innocentes has on all their lives.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel and found the performances to be admirable.  Chevalier uses different characters to narrate different chapters so a more valid story is revealed rather than one told by only one point of view. The actual process necessary to create tapestry from painting is related in fascinating detail.<br /><br />Although by no means as compelling a masterpiece as \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring,  \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" nevertheless successfully weaves a set of interesting \\"What-ifs\\" that are reminiscent in their no-holes-barred bawdiness of the Canterbury Tales in content and depiction of the age.  As little is known about the tapestries, I can only commend Ms Chevalier on her inventiveness and ask her to conceive and write quickly as her ever increasing fan base increases with each art conception novel she writes.conceive and write quickly as her ever increasing fan base increases with each art conception novel she writes.	2004-09-09
US	53093124	R1XGOMRPFMXOEB	0440241073	782272714	The Summons	Books	3	2	2	N	N	As Expected	Grisham writes a great \\"in transit\\" novel.  By this, I mean, you buy it in transit, at the airport, you read it on the plane and you dispose of it in the nearest waste bin at the next destination point.<br /><br />I listened to this one on audio tape after swearing a dozen times never to waste my time again on another of these Southern-set-lawyer's tales, but having seen the film Runaway Jury, I decided to give Grisham another chance.<br /><br />I exercise while I listened to this offering about Ray Atlee, a UVA law professor. dealing with his Mississippi judge father's death and the lack of estate that the old man left him and his substance abusing brother.  As many of the other reviewers have suggested, the novel's plot is weak, yet it was sufficient enough to keep my attention as I ran through my paces.  When Ray finds boxloads of money amounting to over 3 million in cash secreted in the judge's run-down house, he doesn't quite know what to do with it, but knows he has to keep it away from his brother who will only blow it all on his expensive and life-threatening habits.  Unfortunately, someone else knows about the money and as the threats begin, Ray realizes that he must figure out how the judge got the money and why he didn't list it as a part of his estate.<br /><br />Grisham makes his point clear when both good and self-serving intentions run amok.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found the ending not well but sufficiently planned to round out this tale of greed and Southern family.<br /><br />As I live in New Orleans, I find that Grisham does a good job of depicting his Southern types--so much so it sets my Yankee teeth on edge. His characters are unlikable and practically cliches---still waiting for the Civil War to have a different conclusion while gambling away their money at the Gulf Coast casinos.<br /><br />Recommended only to those who are going to listen to this while engaged in some other activity.	2004-09-05

That being said, I admit to having no idea as to whether or not Vreeland successfully portrays the artist and the woman validly.  I will say that the Artemeia who speaks in first person in this novel certainly knew what she wanted most in the world and took great pains to get it at the expense of many other people in her life.  Vreeland uses her literary license to the extreme in conveying Artemesia's sensibilities as that of a modern day feminist even though she also does a fine job of exploring the focus of religion and God so prevalent during the historical period.  Vreeland's Artemesia is an angry woman as is her right; she was raped by her father's collaborator and treated shabbily by her father who more or less chose his art over her respectability. But Vreeland uses this event, which is not related in the novel, to drive the character and at times her modern rationalizations do not match her 16th century inability to lash out about it.  Even though Vreeland suggests that Artmesia realizes through her analysis of her father's actions regarding his family and how it fit in with his art, that her motivation was to manifest the beauty and ideal of God, the reader assumes that perhaps her quest for respect with regard to her rape drove her to create great art rather than her purer need to simply create.<br /><br />Whether or not Vreeland is correct in her portrayal matters not, \\"The Passion of Artemisia\\" should be of interest to anyone who likes the Renaissance and novels revolving about the great art of the time.  Mainly a character study of the title character, the novel suceeds in chronologically detailing the motivation behind Artemesia's major works while weaving the story of the artist's life after the rape.  Artemesia's relationship with Galileo is especially of interest, like Artemisia, Vreeland's Galileo is wise and too astute for his time--- The depiction is devoid of any real romantic alliance, Vreeland's Artemisia sadly misses key components with the important men in her life with which she attempts to replace, sometimes successfully, with her art.  All in all, Vreeland's Artemesia is wrought with frustration and a bitter anger. True?  I don't know.  Anyone who created such beauty could not have been suffering so during that creative surge---perhaps afterwards. The author resolves this angst at the very end of the novel in a key scene invovling the artist and her father, but overall the reader does not get a real sense of satisfaction----instead one feels that the rushed ending should have been supplemented by some additional information where the fruits reaped by a mellower Artemesia are observed and nodded over.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this book so I have no idea if an appendix exists which sheds some light on what Artemisia did with the rest of her life once she had rectified her feelings of her anger towards her father as the author suggests. The audio version also contains some filler music used to punctuate particularly sad scenes which I thought unnecessary and a bit overdone.<br /><br />This all said, I still liked the book and I recommend it to all who like novels about art and artists.  Keep in mind however that the feminist tinge to the telling of this tale does not make it truly representative of the period and therefore suspends belief at times.  I found myself wanting this modernly depicted Artemisia to have it out with her father,  turn the page and get on with her life.  Something tells me that in real life, this is exactly what she did do.  However erroneously portrayed, Vreeland's character represents a strong woman with much angst on her plate whose life will keep you turning the pages and wanting to look up her lovely paintings to see what she really was all about.what she really was all about.	2004-09-04

The theme of the book does not emphasize the normal grammar structures or verb drills nor does it highlight naughty French gros mots.  Instead, author Natalie Shorr extends an informative welcome to enter the inner circle of native French speakers in both understanding and imitation.  She hits upon ten topics that will bring your formal textbook French to a more comfortable level where you and the person to which you are speaking are more in tune with each other, resulting in less cultural misunderstanding. Her hints cover a wide spectrum from nonverbal cues, sound effects and interjections, through manners, table talk, practical idioms, slang to the all important use of wit and improvisation in language (think the magnificient French film \\"Ridicule\\").  By explaining the French response to certain expressions used by an unsuspecting native American speaker, the student reader becomes aware of the nuance behind his conveyed mannerisms, his words, the intended meaning and actual interpretation of any of the numerous expressions detailed by Schorr. The text demystifies many all-important ideas like how the French use more words to convey one word ideas in English, the French idea of food and a meal, the way slang is interpreted more negatively when used by a non-native speaker and the very European way of expressing the positive while using negative expressions.  Schorr unlocks the door to understanding this centuries-old civilization by illustrating that language is alive and changing through numerous examples that are gastronomical, historical, philosophical and above all uniquely French and hence somewhat alien to the average American listener and observer. She stresses that once realizatiion of what the recipient of your dialogue understands and interprets,dawns, the non-native will be better equipped to use the right phrases, expressions and gestures to ensure that the correct point is being transmitted.<br /><br />\\"Tune Up Your French\\" is by no means a diatribe about language.  On the contrary, the information for each tune-up or chapter is presented in the following easy-to-read manner: a preview, explanation, list of top ten expressins and some reheasal time to review.<br /><br />The book includes a wonderful CD which runs for about an hour which contains listening and repeating of expressions; the male and female French speakers will review some of the text's highlights and then use dialogue to allow you to practice usage.  Very enjoyable.<br /><br />This book is not for the beginner.  The student purchasing this book must be pretty well versed in French basics.  Some of the phrases used as examples are not translated; others are.  The dialogue portion of the CD is rapid fire (spoken as French is truly spoken) without translation and without repetition.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I most whole-heartedly recommend this very readable and enjoyable departure from most language textbooks.  I would love to see a \\"Tune Up Your French II\\" with another fun-to-listen-to CD.  Tres Bien, Madame Schorr!  Please, McGraw Hill, do a \\"Tune Up Your Italian\\" also,  s'il vous plait!r />\\"Tune Up Your French\\" is by no means a diatribe about language.

I have reduced my overall review by one star only because the book needs to be updated with regard to newer products such as soymilk and newer information regarding certain foods which supposedly is covered in later Montignac editions.<br /><br />For the most part the format of the book is easy to follow and a breeze to read despite some highly technical information regarding the manner in which the body processes certain foods.  The only disadvantage here is the lack of an index which makes refreshing one's mind regarding particular issues a nuisance.<br /><br />The method itself is one of food combining achieved in two phases.  Simply explained, while on Phase One, on does not combine grains or any other carbohydrates in the range of 15 to 50 on the glycemic index with fats or proteins.  Any carb above 50 simply is not eaten.  Montignac urges you to ingest this carbo meal in the AM so that the body has enough time during the day to burn said carbs.  For lunch and dinner he suggests a fat/protein meal which pretty much follows the criteria of any of the popular low carb diets like Atkins and South Beach.  Unlike Atkins and South Beach, Montignac stresses the eating of real food, similar to Will Clower's mandates in \\"the Fat Fallacy\\".  Above all an abstinence from sugar is paramount.<br /><br />After most of your weight is lost and your digestive hormones are back in sync, Montignac suggests phase 2 where a little mingling of fats with higher ranked carbs, sugar, wine and chocolate are allowed in moderation.  His comments regarding chocolate, wine and exercise are extremely astute and a welcome change from the usual calorie burning scenario most diets are based on. Montignac swears that although beneficial in other ways, exercise does not help you lose weight---a fact to which I can relate and attest.  He provides a wonderfully entertaining list of ailments and wine prescriptions of which any wine connoisseur would approve.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This diet works and works well.  I have lost weight while eating delicious foods.  Unlike other more popular diets, Montignac does not cut out any of the major food groups.  You can have your bowl of oatmeal and eat your fruit and not worry about where that extra fiber is going to come from as you would on a low carb regime.  Nothing is missed, if you crave crackers or yogurt, you certainly can eat them; you just rethink the time that you eat them.  Somehow psychologically, this works very well for me.  When I craved something, I just promised myself that I would eat it tomorrow in the AM.  No problem unless you are craving sugar---and even this after a few inital days will subside.  I can honestly say that I have not craved any snacks in between meals since I have begun this regime. During phase 1 there is no portion control, so while you are retraining your body there is no annoying measuring or hand analogies to make.<br /><br />If you are intrigued by the French Paradox, this book may help you demystify it.  For further reading, I recommend Will Clower's \\"The Fat Fallacy\\". a good adjunct that will help you understand the idea of moderation while spoiling yourself on only the best of food.<br /><br />If any of this sounds familiar to you as in Somersizing or Sugar Busters, supposedly Montignac did it first and is sueing Suzanne Somers and the three doctors that wrote Sugarbusters.  This is a good thing---if you are a product person and want to purchase some sugarfree condiments or mixes, these two other diets provide nice websites to accomodate you as Montignac's fare is only available in France and Quebec.e burning scenario most diets are based on.

Amazon's recommendations pointed me to this little novel written by Deborah Moggach, and although very different from Chevalier's work, that creates an imagined scenario from the emotional impact procured from the view of a noted masterpiece, \\"Tulip Fever\\" successfully depicts the Delft of the Grand Masters as it relates the controversy of doomed love and ironic circumstance so admirably executed in the works of O. Henry and Wm. Shakespeare.<br /><br />Sofia, a young girl forced to marry much older widower, Cornelis, because of the impoverished state of her family, falls deeply in love with painter Jan when he comes to their home to paint the couples' portrait.  Always priding herself on her practical sensibilities, Sofia finds herself swept away and suddenly willing to do the unthinkable.  Amidst a backdrop of wild tulip bulb speculation, Jan and Sofia gamble on their love as their thoughtless and inflamed actions swirl out of control and influence everyone that touches their lives.<br /><br />This novel provides a quick read urged forward by short chapters narrated by different character voices---even the painting has its own moments in the reader's spotlight.  I highlight the sub-story of Sofia's maid servant and her hapless fisherman lover as almost enjoyable as the main storyline.<br /><br />This fast and pleasant reading experience that contains some predictable and unexpected moments should make even a better full length motion picture with Jude Law playing Jan and Keira Knightly as Sofia.  The scene of the Tulip marketplace should be exciting and as memorable as the twist ending.  Not as compelling or introspective a read as Girl With a Pearl Earring, but good just the same.	2004-09-01

Instead, we are treated to dual narratives; one the voice of Isabelle, a young woman of the 16th century, caught between her innate devotion of the Virgin Mary and her in-laws Huguenot beliefs, and Ella, Isabelle's modern-day American descendant adjusting painfully to life in a small town in France under the careful guise of researching the French branch of her family tree. Ella's search is prompted by disturbing dreams of the color blue---the color worn by the statue of the VIrgin revered by Isabelle centuries before. When Ella's ancestral discoveries presage the next chapter in Isabelle's sad life and simultaneously pinpoint problems of self identity in her own, the plot takes both characters to Switzerland, a known historical haven for 16th century Huguenot &eacute;migr&eacute;s where one particularly gruesome discovery puts much of the novel's angst into perspective.<br /><br />Although Chevalier's prose moves the story along at a fast pace, I still got the impression that certain aspects of it were not thoroughly worked through. The motivation of many of the characters in the time-passed story were not fully detailed or explained to support the ensuing actions even in retrospect. Ella's romance with her jazz-playing Frenchman almost seemed clich&eacute;d; her difficulty with her husband not really explored to warrant relationship rupture.<br /><br />Nevertheless, readers of Girl With a Pearl Earring will glimpse at the birth of ideas that Chevalier uses to brilliant fruition in her more successful work. The interplay of Catholic versus Protestant, the focus on the covering of one's hair and the idea of a painting expressing otherwise untold emotions are tweaked to perfection in \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\".<br /><br />Read this one, not for the mystery of the murky resolution, but for Chevalier's insights on small town European pragmatism as compared with American optimism.rplay of Catholic versus Protestant, the focus on the covering of one's hair and the idea of a painting expressing otherwise untold emotions are tweaked to perfection in \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\".

Living in an age where classic thought and sensibilities are revisited and possessing an acute mind and an acrid tongue, she must resign herself to a more conventional role as a woman of the Renaissance, bound by duty to marry and bear children rather than be the philosopher painter she wishes to be.  From the moment she encounters the painter from the North that her father has commissioned to paint the family chapel, she is relentless in seeking him out.  While her first desire is to learn the secrets of color and brushwork, she finds herself attracted to the painter in ways she had not expected, and finds herself frustrated in more ways than she bargained when she must follow her appointed path as a Florentine woman.<br /><br />The plot itself follows a rather straightforward course steered by somewhat predictable but well-crafted characters.  Blended expertly with historical details of the age:  the reign of the Medici family, the invasion of Florence by France, the paranoia of the city while under the helm of the monk, and the dropping of famous names like Botticelli, Michelangelo, Fra Angelico and Da Vinci, the author presents us with a fictitious view of what life could have been like back in the early 1500s.  Alessandra's mindset is indeed, that of a 20th woman, a bit cynical and slightly world-weary for one of such tender years, but this adds to her appeal to the author's intended audience.  Overall, the storyline compels one to read on and contains enough hints and little mysteries to keep even the most well-read reader turning the pages.<br /><br />However, what fails miserably is the author's lack of solving any of the mysteries that she so tantalizingly provides for us.  Alessandra fixates on the form of the snake tattooed on the man in the square, so much so that she has one tattooed on her own body---but the reason for her action is muddled and I for one do not understand the actual significance---an act of defiance?  Empathy with Eve and her sin?  Ironically, the significance of one of the most compelling symbols in the book remains coiled but never unfurled.  Similarly, the author hints at the great artist that Alessandra loves and gives us enough clues to make some sort of guess to his identity, but then never actually tells us who he is or if he even existed.  We know he is Flemish from the descriptions of the North Sea and the low country.  We know he studied anatomy when it was forbidden with the likes of Michelangelo at Santo Spirito.  We know that after the fall of Savonarola, he goes off to Rome to escape further persecution.  He returns much later, worldly his sexual and artistic techniques honed like a razor, but again, we do not know his identity.  Personally, as I read, I assumed he was a creation, but enough of my fellow reviewers have voiced that he was a real historical figure for me to investigate.  Lastly, the title, calling to mind Botticelli's masterpiece, has little or nothing to do with the plot.  As this book was published in the same time period when books like Vreeland's Girl in Hyacinth Blue and Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring have great popularity, one cannot help but think that the title suggests another imaginative story behind a great work of art.  The Birth of Venus, however, is the story of a woman and her duty rather than her act as muse for a great painting or sculpture.<br /><br />Bottom line:  if you are looking for a Girl With a Pearl Earring type confection, you will not find it here.  However, if a story told from a woman's perspective, albeit imagined, piques your interest especially told in the colorful velvet world of art and enlightenment of the Renaissance (even in the shadow of Savonarola) you will enjoy undertaking this short journey of duty, love and art.ne tattooed on her own body---but the reason for her action is muddled and I for one do not understand the actual significance---an act of defiance?

What wonderful lifestyle books have come out this past year!  All of them eschew either the old dieting axioms of counting calories or the newer dieting crazes which call for a complete removal of an entire food group, be it fat or carbohydrates, and actually celebrate the enjoyment of eating FOOD.  What a delicious concept:  living life passionately.  Advocating the same message of Arbor's lovely \\"Joie De Vivre\\", a luscious account of the French lifestyle and \\"The Fat Fallacy\\" by Will Clower, an easy-to-read scientifically founded entreaty asking Americans to embrace real food rather than ingest convenience faux food alternatives, Author \\"Gin\\" Jennifer Basye Sander writes a fun book bulleted with interesting insights and hints on how to lavishly eat yourself thin.  Understandably, Gin's role model is Julia Child, the queen of cream, whose long and well-lived life is a testament to all that Gin extols in \\"The Martini Diet\\":  moderation and food snobbery of the highest and most decadent level.  If your idea of dinner is a delectable soup followed by a course of  succulently cooked roast chicken smothered with a wine-based sauce and surrounded by fresh vegetables and finished with a glass of vino and a small chocolate dessert, then by all means, read on, Gin will teach you how to enjoy all this and lose weight at the same time.  No more measuring or arranging your plate to ressemble an annoying food clock; no more skipping the potatoes and the rice or passing on high priced olive oil and vinagrette dressings.<br /><br />Gin's rules are easy enough to follow.  She suggests eating only the best a la the French and their famous French Paradox, eating slightly less of the best, meaning no more supersized, wow-look-at-all-the-food-I-got-at-the-all-you-can-eat-buffet-for $5.99, and eating the best only at mealtimes, where snacks don't count as meals, they simply don't exist. Common un-American sense that embraces the slow-food movement and pushes aside fast food and its convenience as treating yourself with much less than you deserve. Think like a queen, eat like one and look like a princess.<br /><br />With these concepts under your belt, her advice for avoiding the typical American feed troughs is simple and amusing to read--she calls it her Cinnabon Avoidance and in true Proustian style relates a familiar and deadly temptation--that succulent aroma wafting through the airport and the sight of those wonderfully gooey cinnamon buns that are sized like a mini-birthday cake instead of a typically sized muffin.  Her practical tips include using everything under the sun, including breath and tooth whitening strips to get the thought of snacking on treats out of your mind; overall her comments border on breezy, wise-cracker funny and have you head nodding in agreement.<br /><br />Admirably, unlike other lifestyle authors, Gin labels the popular style icons---Jackie O. and her ilk---as TOO SKINNY, commenting on their diets of consomme and lettuce as way too boring and restrictive.  HOORAY for GIN!  Im with you girl--I'd much rather be a size 8 and healthy--with the curves I was born to have!<br /><br />Bottom line: this book is FUN and SAVVY. Its message doesn't only pertain to food, Gin discusses clothing and exercise with the same lavish approach.  Buy well and look well.  Partake in activities you love and you'll never skip a \\"workout\\" again.  Why spin when you can ride a bike in the countryside?  For a different perspective of the same concepts, pick up Clower's \\"The Fat Fallacy\\" and Arbor's magnificent \\"Joie De Vivre.\\"  Read all three with a glass of wine and a square of 70% dark chocolate and forget about the scale because you have satisfied all your cravings---in moderation.ce as treating yourself with much less than you deserve.

Summering on the Greek isle of Mykonos, Delphine ponders the relationship she has with her mother, Nicole, a confused and immature beauty who runs through men like other women run through lipstick, her father, David, Harvard graduate and historian with a penchant for the bottle and Amanda, her eleven year old sister, as different from her as night is to day.  Considered a troublesome child, Delphine carries the knowledge of being an unwanted child throughout her early years and into her adolescence which we learn through Warburton's technique of using the events on Mykonos as a frame for a chronological flashback of Delphine's life.  On Mykonos, Delphine struggles to make sense of herself and her feelings for her family and its strangled history while simultaneously careening head first into a sexual relationship which she later regrets.  It is only through her meeting with Valerie and her 17 year old son Simon, does Delphine find the nurturing and understanding she needs and embarks on an idyllic sojourn which includes the security and affection she so badly needs.  An accepting reconciliation is reached as the summer draws to its conclusion.<br /><br />Written in 1979, this novel captures the free spirit of life on Mykonos with its nightlife and sun bleached vistas.  Warburton does a fine job of conveying the loneliness of the newborn Delphine as she yearns for her mother's love, finds some comfort in the arms of the stern hired nurse and loses respect for her prissy controlling father.  Warburton expertly details the feelings Delphine has for her sister, before and after her birth; in fact, these passages are rather painful to read, so real is the emotional discharge and disintegration of the little girl and the abject misunderstanding of her by the adults.  I particularly enjoyed Warburton's portrayal of Valerie--a bit of a 70s nurturer who although well aware that the day will come when her son has his own separate life, nevertheless dreads her time alone.  Warburton's insights here are quite lovely.<br /><br />Although the \\"love affair\\" and Delphine's sophisticated attitude regarding the ephemeral quality of relationships in general seem a bit blase, the author manages to convey the world weariness of the girl quite well and hence renders her character's actions and musings as psychologically believable.<br /><br />All in all, this sad little story reflects a distressing emotional abyss that two self-centered parents unwittingly transfer to an innocent child and causes this reader to reflect on how disasterous unthinking words and neglect condition a young mind.trayal of Valerie--a bit of a 70s nurturer who although well aware that the day will come when her son has his own separate life, nevertheless dreads her time alone.

Take it from me, Elizabeth Hand writes a good multi-layered olfactory-pleasing book; her descriptions of fragrance and the stirring way they affect the senses lingers in memory with the redolence of the Spice Market in Istanbul. Her prose regarding the other senses singes the reader with a sting like the after image of a neon sign on the retina or the swipe of the finest velvet on naked skin. As the implementers and manipulators of these sensations, all Hand's major characters are extremely and painfully human (except, of course, the supernatural entities that are never quite defined) with weaknesses that we can all relate to and cheer on as they support and move the more sinister and intriguing aspects of the plot along rather nicely. In a nutshell, (or should I say acorn?) Hand's musicality implodes the brain with phrase after phrase of imagery that colors emotions and thoughts with a rainbow palette of intensity I can only imagine is like an LSD trip.<br /><br />On this level, the novel surely succeeds--the reader, never bored, flips from one point of view (there are three masculine protagonists) to another, from one century to another with great fascination, wanting to know, to discover and finally to understand. In the same way that the object of the men's affections, called many names throughout the different time periods, entices the men who seek her out, wanting to capture her on canvas, in print and of course, between the sheets, we are also enticed to the point where we want to pinpoint her genus and specie. We realize from the start that the woman is not human, and we are given hints as to what exactly she is and what exactly her motivation might be, but mysteriously this is never fully resolved. A little investigative work is necessary to at least grasp the essence of the associated myth and even this does not tie up all the loose threads that run through this novel like the frazzled end of a bolt of cut fabric, albeit a lovely rich  brocade. Ms. Hand was kind enough to explain to me that Larkin embodies many mythical creatures emanating from a fairy world with little contact with the more fragile human existence.<br /><br />There is so much that is not explained and this adds to the slightly fogged out feeling that we share with the male protagonists as they interact with this supernatural situation.  I speak of allusions to the scissors of Dr. Learmont, the green light, the fantasy world glimpsed by all the artists and sought after---metaphors for the creative process? I am uncertain. From Larkin's obsessive objective, who was Val and how were we to make the connection? The character of Juda---sometimes a woman, sometimes a man, sometimes as fluid as water---acts as a sentinel of sorts; Ms. Hand likens her to Puck, mischievous yet responsible for Larkin's escape from the other world.  Nevertheless, as fun as this novel is, I would have totally enjoyed more of an explanation, or at least another chapter that would have gained me more insight and more of Hand's deliciously edgy phrasing.<br /><br />As far as the storyline, however, none of this really matters.  As she does in Waking the Moon and the Glimmering, Hand compels us to enter this strange world where we are left a little mystified yet are better for the journey.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the otherworldly quality of this read and recommend it to anyone who likes a glimpse at the creative process. The interplay between real historical characters and those crafted by Hand works well as do the backdrop of the insane asylum and the labyrinthine back alleys of London. Hand does a fine job of capturing the despair and frustration of each of the men as they lose what they think they desire most.<br /><br />As my knowledge of Welsh myths is slim, I would have appreciated some of Hand's insight in an afterward, maybe an explanation of the myth of Blodeuedd  or the connection to the Dog that JumpsDown.  Fans of 'Waking the Moon', will surely enjoy this novel especially with its cameo of Balthazar Warnick, but, they like myself and the male protagonists will find themselves craving more to make the entire sensory experience click with that satisfactory flash of ultimate understanding.the Dog that Jumps Down.

If you liked the movie version of this semi-autographical breeze of a read, you certainly will enjoy Frank Abagnale Jr's madcap recap of a scant few years of his life starting when he was barely sixteen.  Endowed at an early age with a power physique and an attitude to match, Frank has no difficulty in getting people, especially \\"foxy\\" women to believe that he is ten years older.  He blames his short life of crime on a perpetual case of spring fever-where ample loads of cash are needed to fuel this heavenly fire.  A modern day P.T. Barnum, Frank gives his audience what they crave, cashing bogus checks that he becomes more adept at making as time goes on, while embarking on a spree of impersonations that range from doctor, lawyer, airplane co-pilot to university professor.  Even with the full knowledge that crime doesn't pay, the reader cannot help but cheer Frank on as he \\"dead-heads\\" his way across the country and eventually around the world.  As his descriptions of his stay in a French prison makes you wonder if any of this free-loading was worthwhile, we commiserate with his dread of being prosecuted by every country in Europe and are pleased when he finally serves his time in the US and actually escapes.  Unlike the movie, the book devotes little time to the FBI agent who shares the cinematic spotlight or to the actual dynamics of Frank's family life.  In fact, only in the book's afterward is Abagnale's actual present day career of check-fraud expert even mentioned.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who want to shake their heads in wonder at teenaged audacity.	2004-07-23

Craving more, I happened upon this little story by Katharine Weber. Not quite what I expected, it nevertheless moves freely after a deliberately murky and introspective opening by narrator art historian, Patricia Dolan. Divorced, Patricia is forever haunted by the death of her only child in an unfortunate school bus accident. Memories of her mother, also deceased, further complicate and plunge her shaky emotions into the subterrean depths of the depressed mind. Enter Mickey, the younger man, a sweet and all-male Irish relation, who charms even Patricia's ex -Boston cop father after reawakening her sexuality with his rough and tumble bedroom savoir faire. Soon Patricia finds herself in Ireland, the sentinel to a tiny priceless Vermeer painting stolen in transit from a museum show back to its owner Queen Elizabeth herself, by Mickey and his band of Irish Republican sympathizers. When Patricia realizes she has been duped, used all along for her art historian's knowledge of the painting and its crating, she must scrounge up all the courage she buried deep within her after the death of her child and her own innocence.<br /><br /> Slow at first as it should be, this tiny novel flounders a little as the voice of Patricia recounts her sadness. Once she establishes her emotional foundation, however, the story picks up a well-appreciated momentum, where the reader feels as if she is moving along with the tide, feeling Patricia's pain firsthand as revelation after revelation clicks into place like the pieces of a sick little jigsaw puzzle. Satisfying ending with delicious descriptions of the fictitious Vermeer and the feelings of beauty, perfection and peace the painter instills within Patricia even after all she has gone through.	2004-07-22

I listened to it on unabridged audio cassette, a particularly well done production that is performed by Jonathan Davis and peppered with a liberal sprinkling of original music composed by the author himself.  At the more than satisfactory conclusion, I found myself in an emotional quandary:  saddened that the last sentence recounting a most exciting sequence of events was echoing in my head, smiling from ear to ear at the pleasing way Zafon ties all the loose ends for all his protagonists, major and minor and needing desperately to wipe my eyes at the last most lasting and endearing images.<br /><br />Zafron is second to Scherazade, herself; he is a master storyteller, well deserving of the famed Victor Hugo/Julian Carax Mont Blanc pen of which he writes.  He binds his tale of a pair of parallel personal histories with the sure skillful hand of a rope maker, twisting and braiding one episode after another in an assured free flow of narration that never fails to compel the reader to desire more, to turn that next page and begin that next chain reaction in a double helix of adventure and personal discovery.  Set against a backdrop of the magical city of Barcelona during the 40s and 50s, narrator Daniel Sempere, living with his widowed father, a seller of books, comes of age.  From the very first page, he plunges headlong into his recount of circumstances that sweeps the reader along with him in a sumptuous indulgence that one can only incur from reading a good book such as this one.  We are privileged to hear age old truth from the wise and lusty Fermin; we encounter truth and beauty from all those who protect the memory of Julian Carax.  Our eyes mist at the simple selfless love between parent and child, community for its individuals and that extended to the elderly through the middle aged.  Evil crawls within the shadows of  a city tainted by war and treachery and personified ingeniously by the ruthless Inspector Fumero.  Yet, romantic love flourishes as Daniel finds and loses his dream girl and then curiously seems to relive the moments in the life of the mysterious author, Julian Carax to whom he is indelibly bound.  Above all, we are treated to a novel about that which we readers love best:  a lost book and its unappreciated author, pining for his lost love in a exiled garret in Paris while his life?s work is destroyed by a crazed madman.<br /><br />I will not give you any more details concerning ?The Shadow of the Wind.?  Know only that I believe it to be the most satisfying novel that I have read in at least the last 10 years.  After a listening session, I found myself pondering the permutations of possibilities, yet never once did I see the entire picture until the very end. I looked forward to predictabilities but as this novel differs from any that I have recently read, there are none.  I was happily spellbound throughout and give it my highest recommendation.  I will humbly ask Mr. Zafon not to sell the rights to this masterpiece to any film producer; like Beatriz, I desire only to filter in the images and the dramatic persona through my own sieve of experience.  I want no interpretation embodied within the medium of film.  To see, to smell, to hear and feel the undercurrents coursing through this work within the boundless confines of one?s own mind, is all that is necessary.  Bravo M.

US	53093124	R2FPNPJWHEH5P5	0151010749	382155161	The Ghost Writer	Books	3	9	12	N	Y	Boo!	Author John Harwood creates a page-turner of a story seeped in atmosphere bordering on the unreality that defines a true Victorian ghost story. The novel contains all the right ingredients: spectacularly thrilling backdrops and chilling happenstances. In Mawson, a dead-end town in Australia, young Gerard lives with his quiet yet intensely possessive mother.  From her fondly reminiscent stories, he learns of the fabled Staplefield, her girlhood home, an old English estate, a manorhouse surrounded by green grounds and an old gazebo and once ruled by his great-grandmother,Viola, a published ghost story writer whose odd little stories have a peculiar way of presaging the outcome of her descendants.  The discovery of an old photograph of an unknown woman and his mother's subsequent rage over his distrubing her private papers, further piques Gerard's already engaged mind with regard to his family history. His acquisition of female penpal Alice Jessel, a nod to Henry James' &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot;,incites more anger from his mother; her Staplefield stories abruptly end yet her frozen frightened silence motivates Gerard to turn Sherlockian in his quest for family information.  As he grows from an adolescent to a young librarian, he travels to England to uncover the truth with Alice his faithful &quot;invisible lover&quot; (whom he never meets until the tail end of the novel) spurring him on through letters and  e-mails.<br /><br />As Gerard finds them, the reader is privy to Viola's strange ghost stories--these told in an authentically dry pre-20th century style---and little by little the warped history of Gerard's life begins to come into focus, albeit a fuzzy one.  The ghost tales, deliberately ambiguous, supply details and only some motivation for the actual reality.<br /><br />Harwood succeeds quite well with this technique of interspercing of Viola's incomplete manuscripts with Gerard's rather straightforward narration, although I will admit to groaning aloud at times in the break in the momentum.  As readers, we are intrigued and simultaneously somewhat bored with the climactic discovery of the real Staplefield, a quintissentially spooky old place, ruined, as all such houses are, by time and circumstance and with Gerard's (an Harwood's) overly ambitious efforts to plow through the dust and put the mysteries to rest so that he and his Alice can live happily ever-after.<br /><br />Does it all work?  Almost.  Harwood shrouds all the major characters except our narrator with a boundless eccentricity that delivers enough adrenaline to keep those pages turning until the last quarter of the book.  Alice, disabled from a car accident, does not wish to meet with Gerard until she is healed by a serious of operations.  Phyllis, his mother, is obsessive in her maternal diligence to the point of questioning her sanity; Viola's literary protagonists all mirror the family truth in some oddly deliberate way that only becomes clear at the novel's close. Miss Hamish, the little old lady key-keeper of the manor, stands out like a red herring with fun Dickens-esque coincidence. It is only the last portion of the novel that does not deliver the necessary jolt to the nervous system that other ghost stories achieve with one phantom arm tied behind a white-sheeted back.  Sadly, the major end bit of horror borders on the predictable with not enough time spent on building the necessary cold-sweat reaction.  On a whole, the novel is crafted admirably --- all of the stories within the larger narrated story and the particulars of the family history remain completely unknowable until revealed --- but, the denouement is ultimately muddled and hence unsatisfying.  Viola's ghost tales hint at the outcome of each of the hapless male protagonists, and therefore we understand the consequences of Gerard's investigative actions.  But in this case,where we expect more, we receive less: the novel fails in its mission to generate enough horror to cause that satisfying crawl of gooseflesh along the skin.  Nice try though, with wonderful literary references to classic tales of horror and detective fiction.wl of gooseflesh along the skin.

Like &quot;Blood-Red Rivers&quot;, this novel defintely falls into the Jean-Claude Van Damme class of thriller, with a tough, world-weary protagonist who is never ruffled by weapon-wielding thugs jumping out from behind museum displays, a ghost town nuclear reactor mysteriously turning on full blast or life-long acquaintances stepping surprisingly into the role of first class Judas within the blink of a well-trained eye. None of this is really offensive; Grange's method of storytelling makes you want to believe in the improbable; his heroine, wild-life observer and martial arts expert with a twisted past, although a bit modeled on Angelina Jolie's Laura Croft persona, depicts a bizarre vulnerability beneath the outsider's aloofness.  Her desire to adopt an Asian orphan, the premise which drives the story, is never fully explored, but nonetheless, provides a different starting point from the typical group of unexplained murders that usually jumpstarts this sort of book.<br /><br />Grange weaves politics with violence and the supernatural to create a very different story that will definitely catch your attention.  Unfortunately, I believe that the translation leaves the American reader groping for character motivation and a little more description when first encountering the streets of Paris, the provinces and the other more exotic international terrains. M. Grange, please insist that your translator have a better grasp of American colloquilisms.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite the rough translation, I do like Grange's storylines.  They are different and unpredictable; the third person narration moves the story nicely; the French venue adds a foreign quality to the mystery which allows the reader to explore and ponder cultural differences. I would like Grange to examine the characters more from a flashback perspective.  Instead of being told about Diane's teenaged tragedy, I would have liked to go back in time and experience it from her adolescent mind and then re-explore it from her more seasoned mindset.differences.

But after this bout of fuzzy thinking, the fast pace and non-stop excitement narrated in the intelligent and frat boy confident voice of Washington staffer Harris Sandler. moved me along at breakneck speed, unraveling a mystery as labyrinthine as the old gold mine in one of the novel's most exciting sequences.  Bored to an unhealthy cynicism with the Washington CYA scene of political manuevering, Harris and his best bud Matthew have spiced up their otherwise mundane careers by doing the unethical:  gambling on Congress in a little wagering fun known only by a select few as the Zero Game.  Very early on in the novel, the sure thing turns bad, and Harris finds himself in an unthinkable position: on the run for his life from a maniacal assasin with a black box tool that simulates a heart attack when used on its intended victim, with 17 year old Viv Parker, a senate page from Michigan as his only ally.<br /><br />As Harris and Viv weave from DC to South Dakota and back attempting to uncover the secret of the Zero Game, the reader unearths vital information about the smooth and clever Harris Sandler whose pin-striped perfection hides a disillusioned knight unhorsed by over ten years of back-stabbing DC wheeling and dealing.  The innocent, idealistic and religious Viv plays the light to his shadow and together they make a wonderfully precocious and unforgettable team.<br /><br />The denouement is not predictable, the science interesting, the Washington insider scenes informative and the thrills lasting  until the epilogue. If listening to the audio performance, Scott Brick does a more than admirable job of depicting Harris' fallen angel personality; his Viv is brilliantly bright-eyed and wholesomely winsome.<br /><br />At the end, the two protagonists part ways, but I would like to see these two reunited in the future, say 10 or 15 years down the road; perhaps difficult for the author to envision a future political climate, but fun nevertheless to imagine what could happen to these two down the road.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to all those who like a little espionage with a domestic rather than Ludlem-esque international flavor.to see these two reunited in the future, say 10 or 15 years down the road; perhaps difficult for the author to envision a future political climate, but fun nevertheless to imagine what could happen to these two down the road.   <BR><BR>I recommend this book highly to all those who like a little espionage with a domestic rather than Ludlem-esque international flavor.	2004-07-02

From cutting edge software and hardware development companies to Palo Alto think tanks, the plot follows the creation of a less than $300 computer from a list of low priority projects at the think tank level to the actual modeling of a prototype that gets one rival top dog engineer's undies in a knot.  The trials and tribulations that face the group compare to the highs and lows of an EKG with enough back-stabbing, personality manipulation and corporate espionage to keep the reading at a wonderous pace up until the last 20 or so pages.  The crafting of the dramatic persona, especially the four progtammer/hardware specialists hinges closely to the usual stereotypical portrayals of techno geeks seen in movies and television shows.  However this does not detract from the fun level of the story; indeed one gets the sense that these portrayal closely model reality.  What does detract is the rather abrupt ending which winds down what could have been an all out page-turning business adventure with a stop-on-a-dime conclusion that certainly did not satisfy me.<br /><br />Perhaps having seen the rather burlesque film version of this novel, I naively was expecting more bells and whistles and a more thorough troncing of rival engineer and threat Benoit.  It never came, but perhaps that is due to the fact that I know nothing about the world of Silicon Valley where Bronson's could-be spoofs on the computer industry's behind the scenes star would lose their bite.  Happily, the novel does not force a romance between Caspar and his housemate as in the movie version; here the attraction is noted and the reader can use his imagination to determine the outcome. Thank you, Po.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the novel; I just wish it had a longer ending.	2004-06-28

Although many readers of these three novels, &quot;Thornyhold&quot;, &quot;The Stormy Petrel&quot; and &quot;Rose Cottage&quot;, feel that Stewart's storytelling techniques within them had weakened, I do not find this to be the case.  I agree that these storylines do not revolve around a situation involving murder or any other sort of mayhem that provides the focal point of her internationally set so-called suspense thrillers.  Here, the first person narrators are in a transitional period where the discovery of self becomes the primary mystery and the gentile north country setting provides part of an answer rather than an exotic backdrop. The lack of alien setting or heart-pumping life and death circumstances does not, however, detract from Ms. Stewart's overwhelming ability to place the reader inside the head of the narrator and see the world from her perspective.  The same talented hand that wrote &quot;My Brother Michael&quot; and &quot;This Rough Magic&quot; is ever present in the warm and comfortable scenes depicted within the Rose Cottage.  As her uncanny ability to reproduce a scene for all five senses works as powerfully here as in any of her other works, I merely think the novel contains a smaller story, yet maintains the same perfection in storytelling.<br /><br />Specifically, &quot;Rose Cottage&quot; relates the &quot;coming of awareness&quot; of Kate Herrick, a young woman in a state of transition. Born on the wrong side of the blanket in a small northern village, she faces the future alone in London after the death of her young husband during WWII.  Her grandmother's illness calls her back to the village of her childhood to close up her old home and retrieve some beloved items of her grandmother's before the cottage is converted into a rental.  Here, in her inimitable way, Stewart flourishes as a writer.  Her descriptions are beyond comparison and her ability to introduce us to the strong, plainspoken and unforgettable country personalities that she herself must know and love, locks us into her beloved territory where gardens are all secret and incredibly beautiful, cats and dogs make the most satisfying companions and neighbors, however annoying, make the most wonderful apple pie. Expertly, Stewart manipulates the interplay of the village curiosity with Kate's happy but reluctant past, serving to simulataneously rewelcome Kate into the old fold and to alert her to strange goings-on at the cottage that unbeknownst to anyone relate directly to Kate's questions about herself and her future.<br /><br />I recommend this simple story to all those who love Stewart's way with words.  I listened to this book on unabridged audio and found myself not only well-acquainted with all the adorable quirky characters but quite willing to give-up my semi-urban existence for a life in a lovely rose cottage where the milkman still delivers whole milk in a glass bottle and a cup of tea competently takes the place of any prescription drug.Stewart flourishes as a writer.

For protestant Griet, just 16 years old and forced into service as a maid due to her family's poverty, the very Catholic household of the famous Delft artist bears little ressemblance to her life as the daughter of a tile painter.  Although assailed by mountains of laundry and other monotonous and never-ending kitchen duties, she nevertheless has the acute perception of an artist's daughter to notice the odd dynamics that bind the inhabitants of the household together as deftly as Vermeer's brushwork depicts the light shining on the face of one of his models.  &quot;He&quot; as Griet awefully refers to Vermeer, lives only for his painting; his mother-in-law agrees to any of his whims to insure a faster end-product with happier patrons and hence more revenue to keep the household from slipping into financial ruin.  His wife, Katerina, desperately wants to be a part of the world Vermeer sees with his painter's eye; she smoulders pettishly when she realizes that Griet is admitted into his world wordlessly as Vermeer recognizes something within Griet that defines her as a kindred spirit.<br /><br />Chevalier fills the novel with the tasks of an everyday Delft so real, one marvels at the magnificence of her invention.  Her simple concentration on Griet's cleanliness; the whitness of her cap, the studied way in which she wears it with the two ties hanging on either side of her face to hide her expression, reminds us of the Biblical maxim &quot;Cleanliness is next to Godliness.&quot;  Yet, the author ingeniously uses this bit of clothing and its accompanying characteristics to display Griet's dual nature: a Protestant girl who wears her snow white cap fears gossip in the marketplace and frowns upon what she calls &quot;Catholic art&quot; displayed in the Vermeer home and a girl with unruly hair that needs hiding within the cap's entrapment hints at an equally inruly spirit that would not hesitate to go into the alley with the handsome butcher's son and have him grope under her wanton skirts.<br /><br />Chevalier paints a lovely portrait of a young girl's resignation to a live the limited life to which she is born yet to live again in innocence, beauty and expectation forever captured within the medium of canvas, paint and linseed oil.<br /><br />I thorougly enjoyed this novel.  I listened to it on unabridged audio and never once was I bored at the simple straighforward narrative told in Griet's controlled voice.  Here the love affair takes place in the world of canvas; so if you are expecting romantic fireworks set in a skyrocketing July 4th tableau, forget it.  This novel concentrates on a full spectrum of emotions that burn underneath the skin with the steadfastness of an eternal candle rather than the &quot;appearances-be-damned&quot;, &quot;no-holes-barred&quot; passions that are snuffed out after carnal lusts are spent.eeds hiding within the cap's entrapment hints at an equally inruly spirit that would not hesitate to go into the alley with the handsome butcher's son and have him grope under her wanton skirts.  <BR><BR>Chevalier paints a lovely portrait of a young girl's resignation to a live the limited life to which she is born yet to live again in innocence, beauty and expectation forever captured within the medium of canvas, paint and linseed oil.  <BR><BR>I thorougly enjoyed this novel.

In the South Beach Diet, author Agatston punctuates not-so-new dieting ideas with recipes created by notable restaurants in the Miami area.  Other than that, there is really nothing new about this book in terms of the actual diet itself. Although, sadly, he does not address exercising at all,  Agatston does do a marvelous job of describing the typical yo-yo syndrome where the dieter does well for a few weeks and decides to remain on the induction and most limited format of the plan in order to accelerate their success.  In this case, the dieter then discovers that the limitations of eating just eggs, chicken, fish, green vegetables and good fats are way too restrictive; they get bored and abandon the diet in stages.  First a few cookies, then a slice of pizza and then before the realization is made, old ways that put on weight are back on a daily basis.  For this reason, the author demands that the dieter moves onto the next phase after the first two weeks. Great recommendation! Limited carbohydrates are then included, but these never include the usual low-carb suspects of white rice, white flour or potatoes in any abundance.  He suggests an old Zone trick which I will attribute to Karen of Karen's Kitchen in San Diego of using steamed cauliflower, low-fat milk and some oil to create a tasty substitute. As a doctor, he makes using the glycemic index which has already been utlilized in other insulin balancing diets like Sugarbusters, easier to understand.  His more basic explanation puts the Zone's rather complicated block break-down also based on glycemic index and saturated fat reduction to shame.  Likewise, his discussion of the maintenance phase is better understood than the Atkins maintenance phase where tweaking carb amounts plays a big role in discovering the body's carb allowance.  In addition, Agatston also recommeds full usage of low-fat products like milk, cheese and yogurt and doesn't seem to have a problem with recommending sugar substitutes like Splenda.<br /><br />Bottom line: the SBD seems to be an Atkins plan that eliminates the Zone's not-so-good protein, carb and fat choices in the second phase. Whether or not it is satisfying or you can do it for 20 years is a question to which I don't know the answer. It can certainly be done in intervals, but eating salads 24/7 gets old.  The ricotta dessert suggested in the first phase tasted like paste.  I'd rather eat nothing.  But that's just it---is there really a reason to eat everything that the author suggests in a day?  Is it a formula like the Zone? Or is it just a matter of balancing insulin?  Which is correct---the little meals theory boosting metabolisms or the three meals a day no snack regime?  What I don't quite understand is what people did to maintain their weight before the influx of low fat dairy and other diet-type foods? I seem to remember cutting back on starches and cutting portion size because calorie intake was what mattered.  Then the dieting industry went into full swing and my mom was drinking Metracal!  Why not simply not have a smaller portion of whole milk---a third of a glass is certainly more satisfying than 8 ounces of low-fat or skim, isn't it? Two tablespoons of whole fat yogurt without all the added junk is all I really want to have with my breakfast---but, is that a problem?  I am not sure what the message is---is low fat diary better than whole fat dairy---or is it just a quantity issue? These reduced fat ideas work if you can stick to it.  Will Clower's book &quot;The Fat Fallacy&quot; addresses this issue and many of his followers have achieved dieting success and satisfation and have lowered their cholestrol.  Perhaps using SB to jumpstart and then simply eating less real food may be the real answer to the dieting dilemma..  <BR><BR>Bottom line: the SBD seems to be an Atkins plan that eliminates the Zone's not-so-good protein, carb and fat choices in the second phase.

US	53093124	RSIXVL1ZEX2G	0446363669	666253702	The Doomsday Conspiracy	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Dated But Still Fun	I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book read by David Dukes.  He does an admirable job of conveying Sheldon's minimal dialogue and page-turning episodic scenes.  The plot is classic Sheldon with a Sci Fi twist, which I confess startled me at first, had me laughing for a second and then once I suspended disbelief held me until the end of the story, although loosely.  The main character, Commander Bellamy is a supposed excellent field agent for naval intelligence, his final assignment before throwing in the towel leads him on a world wide search for a bus load of tourists who have witnessed what the Navy wants people to believe was a weather balloon.  Shades of Roswell!  Unfortunately with series like 'Roswell' and Sci Fi Channel mini-series like 'Taken', this plot line has definitely been done before in full technicolor conspiracy which reduces the power of the book to intrigue and keep the pages turning.  Bellamy's past---he is grieving over a failed marriage whose reminiscences at times can be downright sickening---perhaps makes him a bit dim-witted regarding the fate of the people he tracks down---he discovers the identity of all of them before he realizes that something isn't quite right with his assignment in the first place. What takes weeks for him to puzzle, the reader already suspects and expects.<br /><br />Similarly, the ending is ultimately disappointing because it seems rushed; so much time is spent on Bellamy's quest and his superior's subsequent action but little time is devouted to the climatic finish.  The last tape cassette consists of Sheldon's notes to the reader, itemizing strange events and cover-ups that are associated with the US space program and hint at a real-life Doomsday Conspiracy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite its flaws, the novel entertains as only a Sidney Sheldon novel can.  Its not one of his best, but I think this is probably due more to the over exposure of the subject matter.	2004-06-13
US	53093124	R4UBD34OJHNFF	0312275374	286136965	Sacred Ground	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Generational Tale of Discovery	When Erica Tyler, a controversial archaeologist, takes a stand regarding the discovery of the 2000 year old bones of an aboriginal woman found after an earthquake disturbs a cave in the Los Angeles region of Southern California, she embarks on an incredible journey of love and self-discovery while uncovering the story of an unknown Indian tribe whose history parallels that of the state of California.<br /><br />As Erica battles both the Native American tribes who disagree with archaelogists interfering with the graves of their own, and her boss who is intent on turning the cave into a museum financed by a wealthy and influential benefactor, she relates the troubled story of her own past, an ordeal of abandonment, foster homes and trouble with the law.  Concurrently, in an every other chapter format, Wood retells the bittersweet history of the Topaa tribe, founded by medicine woman Marimi, an outcast from an Arizona tribe forced to traverse the desert and settle her family near the Pacific ocean.  Unbeknownst to Erica, the strength of Marimi and her descendants, warrior women who suffer from the dehabilitating headaches of prescience, infuse her with willpower and steadfastness of her own and with the help of lawyer and love interest Jared Black, she finds her way as did Marimi and her kin.<br /><br />As always, Wood weaves a powerful tale of healer women whose compassion and sense of obligation acts as a strong repellant for all things negative.  Her pages on the Topaa tribe fascinate; the reader cannot help but finish this novel in one or two days.  Reminiscent of Michener's 'Centennial', without the cumbersome geological first chapters, her personal stories regarding the different generations of women remind me of an adult version of the American Girls series, where individual stories are intertwined with great moments of American history to allow the reader to empathize with the times and the time's emotions.  Here, Wood delivers a page-turning tale of a strong yet subjugated people who make up the backbone of today's California.  Nicely done.<br /><br />If you are looking for a romance tale, this novel focuses more on self-discovery and the resolution of identity.  As in other examples of Wood's work, Jared, although a fine masculine specimen, is depicted as more of a helpmate playing second fiddle to Erica's strong first. I also thought that the ending was a little rushed, but perhaps this is due only to the fact that usually I expect a Wood novel to be almost 500 pages.<br /><br />All in all this is recommended to all who are fans of Ms. Wood or like novels depicting strong women in less than perfect situations.subjugated people who make up the backbone of today's California.

The \\"Jesus Thief\\" crosses the thriller boundary with a predictable story line where the emphasis is on faith and sacrifice rather than dodging the bullets created by a temporarily mad scientist's desire to vanquish the guilt of the Jews with regard to the killing of Christ.<br /><br />Felix Rossi is the angst-ridden microbiologist and member of a team of international scientists commissioned to study the Shroud of Turin.  When he discovers that his late beloved parents were actually Jews who had renounced their heritage to escape Hitler's Europe, Felix runs emotionally amok.  Although, he debates the ethical consequences of his actions, he, nevertheless, steals threads from the Shroud, harvests the DNA from dried blood and implants it within the willing body of his loyal yet out-spoken New York maid.<br /><br />In this regard, Lankford seems to know her stuff, and if all the details are simply imagined, she does a thorough job of specifying procedures and examinations, so much so that I found myself wincing and cringing more than once. However, if Lankford intended her story to be primarily a thriller, this necessity for technical perfection, at times muddles the pace of the book, as do the exacting manifestations of the devout faith all the main characters possess.  Felix, his sister and cohort, Frances and Maggie, the modern-day Mary enviably begin each activity however mundane with communications with the Almighty, causing me to wonder whether the story line was meant to convey the power of such simple yet perfect faith rather than masquerade as a vehicle that has possibilities of becoming a feature film or a television movie.<br /><br />If so, the real strength of Lankford's power as a storyteller does not lie in recreating a Christmas story for the 21st century with themes of racial acceptance (Maggie as an African American contributes a percentage of her gene material to the holy clone), identity crisis (Felix's uncomfortable feelings about his unknown heritage) and scientific ethics (the cloning question is looked at from a variety of aspects in general), but in her uncanny ability to demonstrate love between two unlikely people.  The scenes between Sam, the Irish doorman, and Maggie sparkle with honesty, affection and mutual respect yet are infused with so much sexual heat, their passion glows from the page into the reader's soul as if by magic.  Brava and encore, Ms. Lankford!<br /><br />Because the story does border on perfection in these instances, the reader is ultimately let down by the events of the story, revolving around the sacrifice necessary to preserve the life of the great experiment at the expense of all four of the main characters.  Instead of triggering an uplifting sense of the future where the knowledge of Christ's 'second coming' should exact some jubilation, the reader empathizes with the resigned attitudes of all the major players.  A feeling of doom presages a repeat performance of the first coming 2000 years earlier, as augured by the symbolic usage of the thorns and dogwood cited in the very last paragraph.<br /><br />The novel's villain, a King Herod-wannabe outwitted by Joseph (Sam the doorman) and guided by a magi of his own fears the birth of the child foretold in an astrological chart, remains a viable threat. Although trounced, he seems ready play a big part in a sequel perhaps currently in the workings where further confrontations with the growing child will prove challenging in a sort of reverse Omen type trilogy.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who love a retelling of the Nativity story.  Subtract a star if you dislike too many pages devoted to medical how-to or if you are a romantic at heart and would have liked a happier ending involving two of the most deserving characters.themes of racial acceptance (Maggie as an African American contributes a percentage of her gene material to the holy clone), identity crisis (Felix's uncomfortable feelings about his unknown heritage) and scientific ethics (the cloning question is looked at from a variety of aspects in general), but in her uncanny ability to demonstrate love between two unlikely people.

Those readers expecting Brown's page-turning assured puzzle solving hero, easily reducing age-old mysteries encrypted within easily recognizable masterpieces to child's play while single-handedly fending off adversaries trained to disseminate the likes of the Terminator, will most definitely be disappointed in scholarly Tom, his adjunct Paul, political Gil and duty-bound Charley.  Similarly, the &quot;four&quot; Princeton tradition entrenched students depicted within the pages of &quot;the Rule of Four&quot; have little in common with the elite Latin scholars experimenting with authority and the Dionysian mysteries gone wrong in Tartt's &quot;Secret History&quot;.  Granted, a whiff of a historical conspiracy locked within the scholar-stumping word games of an obscure Renaissance text and murder committed on an elite university campus does call to mind these two novels, but that is where the similarity ends.  The Rule of Four is in a genre all its own and should be explored for its own merit.  Its themes of friendship, father/son expectations and loyalties and the formation of guiltless self-identity are far more essential to the novel than thrill-a-minute murders tempered with mainstream pleasing conspiracy theories and climatic Indiana Jones genre revelations. The novel's epiphany is a private one rather than one that will shake world beliefs.<br /><br />Tom stands alone in the shadow cast by his late father, a scholar whose obsession with hidden 500 year old messages supposedly buried within the text of the Hypnerotomachia, may or may not have cost him his life and reputation.  His friend and roommate, Paul, sponsored by two of Tom's father's colleagues(2 of an earlier group of four), thinks he has discovered the key to the book's cipher and enlists Tom's aid in the Herculean task that ironically becomes as important to Tom as it once was to his father.  As Tom fights his losing battle, succumbing to the power of the unsolved mystery, he simultaneously attempts to escape its grasp while still validating his father's life and discovering his own.<br /><br />As the book yields its secrets, old rivalries and jealousies surface and complex relationships form between all those whom the Hypnerotomachia has touched.  The reader will not be surprised when murder taints the lives of these undergraduates in their last months of senior year. Suspicions rise proportionately to the lengths friends and lovers, apprentices and mentors go to safeguard their own private agendas with regard to the treasures, real and imagined, awarded by the book.<br /><br />A pristine snow-swept campus struggling to move forward into spring's time of renewal, provides an apt backdrop suggesting the angst of the characters as they move from the stage of college life into the real world.  Caldwell and Thomason do a fine job of depicting the sheltered Princetonian world replete with tony traditions that students embrace rather than revolt against.  Main character Tom, waxes philosophical in pretty metaphors that capture his confusion and fatalism, while Paul, the novel's rudder, steers strongly and firmly with never flailing beliefs that eventually carry through to all four of the roommates as they leave the safety of academic life.  The Rule of Four, the coded directions supplied by the book to uncover its earthly treasure, acts as a larger metaphor that ironically points out that in the long run, your final destination is not all that far away from your original point.<br /><br />If you are looking for a few days respite on a snow-covered campus awash with centuries old conundrums and want to meet some dedicated young men and women looking for glimpses of themselves in the past to shed new light on the future, give this book a shot. Not a beach read, by any means, it will satisfy your puzzle-solving needs, but don't look for page after page of &quot;Wow, I should have thought of that&quot; satisfactions.  There are only 4 big riddles uncovered by Paul and Tom in the Hypnerotaomachia--only one of which I could vaguely guess at.  The heart of the novel is one of self definition---the past and present meld together for hope in the future.satisfy your puzzle-solving needs, but don't look for page after page of &quot;Wow, I should have thought of that&quot; satisfactions.

Deeming her old life reckless, she had taken refuge at the solitary Abbey of Sainte Marie de la Mer as Soeur Auguste.  For five years she has lived a predictable life of peace until now when the new Reverend Mother and her personal confessor Pere Colombin infiltrate her island retreat.  But the good father is no priest, he is LeMerle, a seasoned actor from Juliette's past---the leader of the troupe of players who could have been Fleur's father---a man who has betrayed and murdered whom Juliette both fears and harbors feelings of helpless affection and deep regrettable love.  Before Juliette can even imagine what he has come to the Abbey for, she and her daughter are caught as pawns in LeMerle's personal activation of an agenda fed on revenge and anger rooted in LeMerle's shady past.<br /><br />Like Joanne Harris' other leading ladies, Juliette of 'Holy Fools' delights in being a pragmatic woman on her own who does not hesitate to ameliorate good fortune or banish evil through unconventional means: her gypsy mother's charms, frequent readings of the tarot, the scientific alchemy learned by her childhood tutor and herbal potions galore.  Certainly no wallflower, she has no qualms about using her body in lieu of her mind in order to reposition herself positively in the hazardous melange of religious fervor and superstition that defines her world of 16th century France.  Her tales are told in flashback to fill the reader in on her assessment of her situation as LeMerle's plot unfurls.  Harris masterfully and commendably conveys the poignant wishes of any mother along with the desperation and vulnerability associated with being responsible for another life while using Juliette's voice.<br /><br />While the reader has no problem understanding Juliette's motivation with regard to Fleur, I think her attraction to LeMerle could have been more chemically described, perhaps in the portions of the story where LeMerle's voice is heard.  We hear him as a villain using the superstition of the time to feed old anguish and we comprehend that he does have regrets regarding his reliance on Juliette's reactions in the overall outcome of his plan.  While we feel her pain with regard to the loss of her daughter, and her anger in terms of LeMerle's betrayal, we don't quite engage in the elemental love between these two main characters.  Granted, the LeMerle character has a lot going on, as does Harris as she attempts to keep the master plan an overall secret, but I still would have liked to feel more of the magnetism between the two.  This would have contributed much to the ending, which in itself came as a bit of a surprise only because Juliette shows a little too much of her anger for LeMerle and concern for her daughter rather than reveal that secret part of herself that glows only in LeMerle's presence and may succumb even in the face of motherhood.<br /><br />In spite of this, I still give the novel 5 stars.  Harris simply tells a great story and evokes a France of history.  Her use of the Abbey with its tide-dependent causeway set on the Atlantic coast of France near Nantes brings back the familiar sensual pleasures evoked by the same setting in her earlier book &quot;Coastliners.&quot;  Here the origins of the mermaid-tailed Sainte Marie-de-la-mer from her mythical island of Le Devin is explained and instead of the adorable and disagreeable villagers of Les Salants we are introduced to a community of nuns, all saints and sinners.  Instead of the food used as aphrodisiac and appeasement in her food trilogy, Chocolat, Blackberry Wine and Five Quarters of the Orange, we are medicated with Juliette's herbal potions and gypsy cantrips and dazzled by the sights, sounds and scents of the older still mesmerizing Harris portrayalof France.

Is it like &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;, the short story of a psychological journey where middle-aged faithless Cora, wife of an Episcopalian minister has been so inured by the late 20/21st century fascination in all things New Age mystical that her innate skepticism turns her towards finding an explanation for the odd occurrences in Dry Falls, Maine in the realm of aliens and UFOS rather than in believing in an actual manifestation of good old fashioned evil of the-tempting-by-Satan brand? Christianity and its traditions are not strong enough or viable enough to conquer the oddball extra-terrestrial imaginings that it does not define; its function is to save the soul.  But what if you don't have a soul to save?  What good is Christianity  then?<br /><br />What a great concept for a story.  If only it had worked on a purely suspenseful level.  But, alas, I must submit to the bewilderment conjurred by Arensberg's mundane style that works when describing gardening hints, recipe advise and disdain over husband Henry's lack of interest in the more intimate realms of married life.  Does she employ this same straight-forward technique when describing her coupling with the incubus of the title simply because she wants to appear 21st century jaded, immune to the truely horrific after a steady diet of the likes of Hannabal Lector and Freddy Kruger in all their graphic gory splendor?  Perhaps. Or maybe she is just giving a respectful nod to old Nathaniel, imitating his 19th century style.<br /><br />And how this would have worked, if only the story had taken on big black leathery bat wings and soared into that part of the psyche that shakes weak traditions and the most steadfast of religious foundations.  &quot;Incubus&quot; just doesn't go there---and I am not talking about Stephen King territory; throughout my reading of this novel I felt the need to beg for some episode which actually left my skin in a goosebump state on a purely mind game level.  All of Arensberg's clever little Hawthorne reversals travel within a medium which doesn't have the clout to deliver any impact.  We, the readers, wallow in our own jadedness, we wait for something to happen, some momentous moment where it will all click and allow some back-pedaling insight to wash over the montony of the story.  This never happens.  Alas.ndor?  Perhaps.

Let's face it Sheldon isn't pretending to be Tolstoy here; the only reason that one of his earlier books, say \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" or \\"The Master of the Game\\", seems more acceptable than \\"The Sky is Falling\\" is because it was written during the Harold Robbins/Jaqueline Suzanne blitz where such fictional characters clearly reflecting their wealthy Hollywood/Washington/Eurotrash/Captains-of-Industry prototypes in all their tinsely glory were considered fresh and honest representations of the ruthless moguls that ran the world and ate in the finest and trendiest restaurants. Such honesty had not been depicted in such a blatant fashion before . . . and readers loved it.  Hunkering down with such a book on the subway, on the beach or in bed on a rainy day was akin to eating forbidden fruit.  Mention of the sex scenes alone most likely turned the hair of the members of the Legion of Catholic Decency gray and for those of us who grew up during this time period, so much the better.  This sinless bird's eye look into a world I was never going to see first-hand, began a whole new genre that has been cloned the world over.  Sheldon hasn't become a tired writer, we, the readers, constantly barraged by this type of escapism, have become almost immune.  But not quite . . .<br /><br />I found the further adventures of Dana Evans, television journalist extraordinaire introduced in Sheldon's earlier novel, \\"The Best Laid Plans\\", entertaining, there is too much action in too many different world cities to be that predictable.  But I wasn't expecting Tolstoy, I was expecting Sheldon.  I purchased the book on tape to listen to while I exercised and I got what I paid for---a great campfire story that was easy to listen to and with enough excitement to extend my exercise time to yet another mile.  Yes, some of novel's conclusions are reached by the reader before they are reached by the protagonist and some of the international scenes are unnecessary and are clearly set up to give the reader a second-hand look at the globe.  But again, this is why a Sheldon novel is purchased:  its quick, its fun and it doesn't take place on your grandmother's farm. The characters are drapped in Harry Winston and D&G, not last year's dungarees.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you want a breeze of a read from a reknowned storyteller or need a great book on tape to get your mind off the pain of your long-distance run, this tale of investigative reporting intermingled with the realities of adopting a disabled child from war-torn Bosnia while dealing with a boyfriend's dedication to his ex-wife, just might fill the bill.  Just don't expect Booker prize literature.Yes, some of novel's conclusions are reached by the reader before they are reached by the protagonist and some of the international scenes are unnecessary and are clearly set up to give the reader a second-hand look at the globe.

This familiar author's voice simply is not present in this offering.<br /><br />The plot, thoroughly early Victorian, features first-person narrator Leyla, a 20-something heroine who stumbles upon her family's curious legacy only after her mother's death and the receipt of a letter compelling her to the Pemberton family manor---a complex that she and her mother had fled after the tragic deaths of Leyla's father and young brother.  Once at the Hurst where her reintroduction to family members fails to strike any fond family memories, Leyla struggles to discern the troubling secret that seems to encumber her relatives with a fatalistic penchant for disasterous accidents and solitary confinement.  Here, Woods successfully reproduces a Poe-like atmosphere where the darkness of the mind rivals that of the devil, yet her renderings of this 19th century world border on the somber; Leyla's sensibilities are far from engaging, making her revelations and quests through Pemberton's dark corridors tedious and rather mundane.  The story, again reminiscent of Poe, tries to horrify us with ideas of madness, hereditary illness and family curses---all of which are presented in a dry unsatisfactory manner that Poe could get away with, but Woods, alas, cannot.  Only during the story's denouement, does the emerging personality of Wood shine through in the personage of the doctor and his rather convenient laboratory analysis of one family member's blood cells. Otherwise, &quot;Curse This House&quot;, stands as a B-rated gothic thriller without the de riguer girl-with-flying-hair-standing-on-a-precipice cover art most of these books employ to lure their readers.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me as a ghost story.  It is certainly not that, and certainly recommended only to those who wish to read this author's earlier works. If you are looking for Gothic go for the gold and read the Bronte sisters, Du Maurier or Edgar Allen himself.  If you want a contemporary ghost story try &quot;Julian's House&quot; by Judith Hawkes or Barbara Erskine's &quot; House of Dreams.&quot;to lure their readers.  <BR><BR>This book was recommended to me as a ghost story.

US	53093124	RG7THK7WMPNG0	0394555716	606537322	Soul Flame	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Epic Quest Set in the Roman Empire	The 400+ page saga of Barbara Wood's heroine, Selene, begins with a mysterious  birth in the ancient city of Antioch durng the time of the first Caesars of the Roman Empire.  Two fugitives, a well-to-do Roman and his in-labor wife, appear on the doorstep of the healing woman, Mera who performs a hasty midwifery minutes before Roman soldiers appear, kill the new father and haul away his wife and baby son.  Unbeknownst to them, Mera, hidden in a grain container, has saved the baby daughter and at the bequest of the dying Roman, rears the child, Selene, as her own, teaching her the art of healing while keeping the Roman's ring and the key to Selene's true heritage secreted within an alabaster rose pendant.<br /><br />As Selene grows into a lovely young woman, Mera's training brings to fruition a competent compassionate healer with a special gift for the medical arts and a curiosity to discover and gather the medical lores and practices of many cultures both familiar and foreign.  Her natural inquisitiveness is piqued during a freak accident in the Antioch streets:  a donkey driver, hit by the legs of a kicking animal, lies with a head wound in the street.  When Selene compels a Greek doctor, Andreas, to treat the wound, she falls helplessly in love with him and together they decide to pool their learning and dedicate their lives to promoting the ancient art of healing while simultaneously alieviating the suffering of the sick.  But as such stories usually go, fate intervenes and Selene and Andreas are separated by misunderstanding fueled by outside factors.  And as Selene attempts to be reunited with her beloved and find out the secret of her ancestry, she undergoes trials and tribulations that promote her understanding of herself and the human condition.<br /><br />As with many of her other novels, Barbara Wood uses her own medical knowledge to augment an already interesting story of a young girls advent into womanhood and her quest for self identity.  An ample sprinkling of word derivations, herb lore and little known facts about the Roman Empire and its customs which have have germinated into today's traditions, keeps the reader turning the pages intent on discovery Selene's next path and garnering enough information about the ancient world to win the next Trivial Pursuit match.<br /><br />Many of the turns the novel takes regarding Selene's medical development are predictable.  Selene's singlemindedness does not endow her character with much motivation other than to create a clean hospital environment for her future patients. In fact, much of the character motivation is merely brushed upon, relying on a few paragraphs of information to provide emotional background for characters about which I would have prefered drawing conclusions based on actions rather than narration.<br /><br />The quest for Selene's parentage however is not only predictable---not in terms of whom her parents turn out to be---but in the convenient way the author presents the denouement to this aspect of the novel and Selene's rather immature reaction.  Even Selene, as dedicated to her vocation as she was, could not have been this naive as a grown woman.  More disappointing was Selene's &quot;reunion&quot; with her twin brother--a rushed scene that sadly takes place within the last 20 pages of a novel that could have afforded at least 100 pages on this very important secondary plot idea.  Most horrendous was the incompete tale of Selene's daughter, who leaves Rome to find her own heritage and to whose end, the reader is left without a clue.<br /><br />The pace of the story hurtles like a snowball gathering momentum downhill.  At first, it is just right, but as the novel nears its end, the revelations and happenstances fly by like scenery observed from the window of a high-speed train.<br /><br />That being said, I still award the story 4 stars for its immense ability to entertain on a very readable level.  The reader is never bogged down with excrutiatingdetail, however I will admit to skipping passages of the character's self-musing simply because I had already gotten the point and didn't need to read every nuance of Selene's painstaking thought development.  Recommended to anyone who wants to be entertained by a master storyteller.I will admit to skipping passages of the character's self-musing simply because I had already gotten the point and didn't need to read every nuance of Selene's painstaking thought development.

American writer, Greg and his petit ami, JP, are hurrying from their apartment in Paris to the South of France for a date with destiny;  JP is about to lose his virginity and become the sire of his own great line of liver spotted dalmations. Along the way, Greg tells in simple, straight-forward prose the amusing story of this journey, where JP's magnificent presence transcends cultural boundaries and opens doors for Greg that would have been ordinarily difficult to breach.  Even the best restaurants fling open their portals and their hearts, wooing JP with succulent dishes fit for this roi des chiens.<br /><br />But the story that will really tug at your heart begins once JP and Greg arrive in the Midi at the home of unlucky bteeder, Bonbon whose life has taken a turn for the worse. When JP shows absolutely no interest in the female for which he is intended and all Bonbon's frustrated attempts seem for naught, JP and his master, turn things around, charming the near-by villagers while planting the seed for another generation of extraordinary companions.<br /><br />Absolutely charming, this book is a gem in every way. The exquisitely rendered drawings of JP and friends that act as a frontpiece to every chapter heading enhance the reader's anticipation of yet another amusing anecdote to follow.  The story itself, would make a rather sweet BBC production--having all the right ingredients---sensitive humans, wise-beyond-years four-legged mentors, doggy and dogged romance and new beginnings where cantakerous characters turn over a new leaf with the wag of a magical tail.  Commendably the author does not compromise his leading man by including a human romance of his own and teases the reader with a picture (worth a thousand words) on the back jacket flap that depicts the prestigious outcome.  Highly recommended----please write a sequel!	2004-05-11
US	53093124	R362KVEJ4JK3K5	0688149111	280932772	The Best Laid Plans	Books	4	2	4	N	N	The Power of the Press	As with all of his novels, Sidney Sheldon's \\"The Best Laid Plans\\" intrigues from the start and compels the reader to continue reading until the very last page is turned.  His use of true-to-life dialogue delivered by larger-than-life characters and unhampered by dense paragraphs of meaningless description moves the story along at a fast enough pace to make this the perfect escape for that day at the beach or airplane trip.<br /><br />The plot is triggered by the actions of a triumvirate of interestng characters:  Leslie Stewart, attractive, ambitious and overly intelligent, has been left at the altar by gubernatorial candidate Oliver Russell.  Oliver, with his good looks and voracious sexual appetite is wooed away from Leslie by Kentucky-Fried Chicken look-a-like, Senator Todd Davis who orchestrates the marriage of Oliver to his daughter and simultaneously begins his campaign to make Oliver the next president of the United States.  When the jilted-bride calls on Senator Davis for a favor, he, believng he will be well rid of her, has no problem providing her with her requested introduction to a wealthy owner of a newspaper in Arizona.  But Leslie has other plans -- she is intent on destroying the reputation of Oliver Russell and she is going to use the newspaper as the instrument of his destruction and her revenge.<br /><br />Along with this mesmerizing trio, the secondary cast gives the story legs--as we applaud Leslie's single-mindedness and her growing acquisitions, we are entertained by the reporters and editors that unwittingly help her set her masterplot into place.  We are privy to the spectaculor rise of television journalist, Dana Evans, who acts as an interesting foil for Leslie---Dana, so committed to making a difference for all the right reasons, and Leslie, so committed to making a difference merely to salve her wounded ego.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  The easy-to-follow plot, fast-paced dialogue and changes of venue from Kentucky to Washington to Bosnia pair well with aerobic activity achieved while listening to the novel on unabridged audio.  Sheldon easily keeps his triumvirate in the spotlight while he adds and subtracts players that power pack the plot with reality and fuel the reader/listener to go the extra mile simply to listen to what is going to happen next.  Recommended to all fans of Sheldon and to anyone who is in the market for a fast satisfying read with the revenge undertones of \\"The Other Side of Midnight.\\"h aerobic activity achieved while listening to the novel on unabridged audio.

Come on, there are no conspiracy theories at work here simply because Rubin bases his eating plan on something that he also happens to believe in.  If you don't like his religious conviction, read around it, but don't miss out on some interesting facts about the food that is currently available to us in our local supermarkets and recommended by today's diet gurus.<br /><br />For the most part, anyone interested in staying healthy already knows what Jordan is going to say; he has simply compiled it in a book format and has added a wonderful resource appendix for those of us who do not have fresh dairy and hormone-free beef available to us.  His insistance on ingesting what he calls HSO is nothing new, many people drink super green drinks on a daily basis; the clenzology and aromatherapy ideas have been around since the dawn of time; he certainly didn't invent them and convenient kits for home use have been around for quite awhile---you certainly need not buy his.  Don't let the commercial Garden of Life blurb in the back of the book deter you---there are also blurbs about many other interesting resources that you just might want to look into---that's why they are in the back of the book as appendices.  (This book suffers from a lack of an index; I found it super difficult to refind things that I had already read without one.)<br /><br />The program uses a 40 day approach--think 40 days of Lent---40 days of fasting in the desert----and breaks down this period into 3 segments, 2 week in each.  The first 2 weeks helps to stabalize your insulin resistance and to balance out omega3/omega 6 ratios that help out your immune system.  A sample meal on this phase is:  a tuna salad with raw carrots and celery.  The next 2 two week periods simply add different food groups into the mix. Where phase one was primarily protein and greens, some dairy, nuts, legumes and oils, the second phase includes fruit and more of a selection in the categories in the first phase. (Sample meal:  Chicken with oregano and mushrooms, corn on the cob and steamed broccoli with carrots and butter.) The third phase is the mainentance phase where good grains are finally included as well as additions to the categories in the other two segments. (sample meal:  Lamb chops, potato with butter, steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots and peas))<br /><br />Rubin includes some testimonials as well as his own story of his successul battle with Crohn's disease.  I found his most interesting chapter to be entitled &quot;The Desperate Search For Health&quot;, where he speaks of many of the common diet and medical fads with which we are currently bombarded.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you don't like Rubin's religion, read the book for the information he has painstakingly provided.  There is nothing odd or absurd about it --- in fact,  his most controversal &quot;don't&quot; is avoiding shellfish; he likes goat milk because it is easier to digest; he explains why he likes fermented products, he doesn't like the American obsession with hygiene products, or the push to eat more soy, he even includes an interesting list on &quot;how to get sick&quot;.

Mado, has returned to the northern French island of Le Devin whose livelihood relies on the bounty of the island saint who controls the tides and the erosion of the island's beaches. Upset by the dissentigration of Les Salants, her hometown, she devises a way to bring the heart back into the village, by stealing the beach back from the rival village on the other side of the island.  With the help of an Anglo drifter, she finds a way to unite the feuding families of her home and infuse them and herself with a faith in the future.<br /><br />Harris' strong suit is her wonderfully fleshed-out characterizations of the island inhabitants.  The Greek chorus of the two nuns, the oldest woman in the community, the old man with the wooden leg as well as Mado's father, Grosjean and the rival merchant Claude Brissmand are all worth their weight in sel de mer.  Her weak point however, is her tendency to get a bit preachy still in Mado's voice towards the end of the novel when this character begins to think of herself as a part of the village and not just an instrument of change---the John Dunne quote of &quot;no man is an island&quot; rings a little shrilly here, the bell tolling allusion even used within the story to signal the villagers to connect in action.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Harris' other novels, you will also recognize a pattern, the protagonist always has a wicked and prosperous adversary, the secondary players squabble like children until the narrator finds a way to use their diversity to create an infallable unit, the love interest has questionable motives and a penchant for bending the law to his advantage---in 'Coastliners' all this works wonderfully well as it did in &quot;Chocolat&quot; and &quot;Five Quarters of the Orange&quot;.  Also at the conclusion, the islanders face too much strife which detracts from the ebb and flow of the main story. The author's motivation to show too much cooperation during these misfortunes admirably shows the development towards that greater village good, but it goes on too long---one disaster scene would have played just as well.  In addition, the focal point of many unknown secrets seems to be given a rather rushed denoument also towards the end of the story--whereas, hints of these hidden motivations, although suggested rather slighly, should have been advertisized a bit more blatantly with more of a sprinkling throughout the entire story.<br /><br />In spite of these flaws at the novel's end, 'Coastliners' is still a marvelous story in which to get lost.  Harris has a way with words, her descriptions take you to the coast where the surf rushes around your ankles and draws you in deep.

If you have read Clower's &quot;Fat Fallacy&quot; and are intrigued with the French diet and its supposed inconsistancies with current nutritional advice, after reading &quot;We Could Almost Eat Outside&quot;, you will perhaps understand better the concept of small bites full of flavor that stay with you and rekindle memories from childhood and other stages of life.  Think the anticipation on Christmas morning or the anticipated crack of freshness in the air after a new snow and comprehension will dawn -- its not the food (or whatever) its the emotion it evokes.<br /><br />Delerm writes down his memories about objects and moments in time, that some readers will find difficult to relate to only because they are seemingly specific to the French culture.  However, if you eliminate the brand names and the high-speed trains, these simple poetic essays will trigger Proustian thoughts in your own mind and you will seek out your own croissant eaten in the street and your own taste of Turkish Delight purchased in a bag and not a box.<br /><br />Thoughtfully and beautifully rendered.  If you can, read it in its original language.	2004-04-23

On a romantic whim, she takes Frederic up on his offer to visit him in Paris, and suddenly Sarah finds herself living in the City of Lights where her honed communication skills become meaningless in the whirlwind of French.<br /><br />Language is not the sole barrier keeping Sarah outside the proverbial candy store window with her nose pressed up against the glass.  She doesn't quite understand the French social situation where quiet mannered restraint is the order of the day. In chapter after chapter of amusing Anglo-Saxon vs. French/Latin anecdotes and speculations, Sarah allows us a sparkling glimpse of her personal epiphanies: how acquiring a dog allowed her otherwise forbidden entry, why wearing sweatpants in the street lowers the standards of an entire city, how she could NEVER eat low-fat again, how the Latin interpretation of the law leads to furtive games played opposite the French authorities, how wording something in seemingly flowery language lands her the money needed to sponser her journalism course and why becoming &quot;almost French&quot; isn't nearly as important as &quot;just being yourself.&quot; Sarah is certainly not 'spoiled', she's just a victim of intense culture shock.  Her revelations are imparted with a cozy friendly narrative sprinkled with just enough dialogue to imbue each character with some depth. I would like hear more from her in a further book as the shock wears off or new shocks electrify with new situations.<br /><br />Readers expecting the details of Sarah's personal relationship with Frederic, her future husband, to be spun out like a rich romantic fairytale, be warned; even though the book is subtitled love and a new life in Paris, the love portion remains private; she relates only that they met in Bucharest, connected and suddenly were living together in France. The reader catches glimpses of Frederic as the quintessential Frenchman; the memoir focuses on Sarah's adjustment, not to Frederic, but to his country and its occupants.  It makes for charming light reading and is recommended to all who like travel essays and don't mind a change from finding the provincial country idyll to discovering the heartbeat of a city.racter with some depth.

The plot hinges on the unraveling of a lovely computer graphics analyst working at a large Silicon Valley company --- someone is following her with the intent to kill her; she has no where to turn, her passive personality prevents her from speaking about her fears the her friends and her uncomfortable relationship with her famous heart surgeon father further defines her as someone who reacts rather than interacts.  When Ashley suddenly finds herself as the prime suspect in a series of brutal sex-related murders, she discovers that the world she relied on is a fantasy and there are only two close friends that can help her recover her sense of reality.<br /><br />I'll say no more about the plot -- to say more would ruin the reader's fun.  As with other Sheldon novels, the author uses dialogue to move the story along at a quick pace.  There are snappy courtroom scenes, revealing patient doctor sessions using hypnosis and other trademark techniques to keep you reading chapter after chapter until the last page.  Although fun, don't expect Sheldon at the top of his game, the story, once the secret has been revealed becomes too familiar rather than formulaic.  When reading a Sheldon novel, one expects and applauds his formula.  I think the subject basis of this story has been over utilized by so many popular writers and recent money-grossing films.  Hence, a slight lack of punch.  Since the story is advertisized as based on a true story, I would have liked to have seen references to the actual facts listed in the back of the book rather than the lists of institutions and articles written on the subject itself.<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book--and believe me it is just the type of story you want to be listening to as you mindlessly exercise.  I found that the page turning characteristic of the story made me want to run further just to discover just what had happened at a particular junction in the plot.  At times the narrator when playing Ashley is a little too naive---but her performances of the two other main characters are well done, accents and all.<br /><br />Bottom line: predictable, but if you like Sheldon's fast-paced fun, give it a shot especially on audio-book.  However, I would not recommend this for family listening.t had happened at a particular junction in the plot.

Frey writes an extremely readable how-to guide which forces the would-be writer to take a good look at him/herself and the story he/she is writing.  Instead of going through the usual definitions of tone, description, theme, characterization and dialogue, Frey cuts right to the heart:  does the writing transport the reader?  Does the story have a premise?  Is the narration strong?  Does the writer deliver to his audience what he promises?  Whether he illustrates his methodology with examples from popular writers like Stephen King and Peter Bencheley or classic literary greats like Jane Austin and Franz Kafka, his upbeat common sense advise underlines the usual directive that a writer must write in order to see his dream become reality.  In order to write the next modern classic, you must color within the lines first, creating a clear idea of what you wish your reader to come away with and sticking to it.  The art has a form.<br /><br />It takes no more than a rainy afternoon to read this book.  As you read, your thoughts will gather and you will begin to experiment with story ideas already gathering dust in your head.  Using his guidelines just may allow you to see past the idea through to a fully developed story. Remember however, that Frey isn't going to write the story for you---he's there to help formulate your thought patterns into something meaningful and publishable.  He may give the art form, but the art is yours to create.	2004-04-17
US	53093124	RL0E9WSWSBXSS	037570387X	923633349	The Autograph Man	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Interesting	If I hadn't listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel by Zadie Smith, I most likely would have stopped reading after my third or fourth attempt in trying to figure out the direction in which the book was heading.  But then I would not have had the pleasure of meeting two of the most enjoyable characters that ever took form on the written page, namely Honey Smith, a once upon a time prostitue now turned autograph hound (modelled I would guess on Divine Brown of Hugh Grant fame) and Kitty Alexander, an aging star of the 50s whose greatest commodity is her stinginess in providing autographs for a once adoring public.<br /><br />As Alex-Li Tandem, the autograph man of the title, knows instinctively, it is scarcity that makes for the most coveted and valuable autographs.  And he values Kitty Alexander's autograph most highly.  Not because she is a great actress, but because she seems to be beautiful despite a blurring of her cultural heritage--Russian Italian, depicting Peking beauties on film---this icon is right up Alex-Li's identity confused alley.  He's Jewish and Chinese and he can't quite get over the death of his father at a very young age.  Does he barter autographs because they symbolize a way for him to stop time, to cheat death and the aging process? (He is not sure he wants to stay with his attractive and sexy girlfriend because he can't deal with the fact that one day she will become old.) Or is he just someone living in the modern world where your emotions and reactions have been scripted for you and available for preview merely by popping a DVD in a machine and watching how so-and-so mastered a particular situation on film?<br /><br />Smith's prose borders on genius--she uses countless \\"international gestures\\" and stage like directions to illustrate and poke fun at the foibles of a world that is caught up in wondering when the big moments are going to occur -- where the symbols that we see in film and books are going to rear their beautiful heads in our own lives and give us that other worldy hint to the big picture.<br /><br />Poor Alex has spent his whole life fantasizing about obtaining Kitty Alexander's autograph.  When he finally obtains it, he sees celebrity from the other side for his brief 15 minutes and he knows there is no message, that life goes on and its not what it cracked up to be.<br /><br />This novel is not for everyone.  The story line only really gets moving once Alex takes off for New York to attend an autograph convention.  It is only then that the clever backdrop that Smith seemingly belabors in the first portion of the book starts to take on dimensions that make any sense.  Again, meeting Honey and Kitty were well worth getting lost in the beginning labyrinth,  and the snowballing story that follows practically begs to be read until the very end where Alex is convinced by his friends to say Kaddish for his father who wasn't even Jewish.  Smith's conclusion seems rushed; Alex's non-epiphany, a little too shrug-of-the-shoulders significant.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Read the book for its cleverness; its wonderful cross-cultural mixtures that for once don't seem to effect the characters in the least with any full blown psychosis stemming from any childhood identity crisis and for its funny satire about seeking fame and celebrity.  Don't read the book for an elaborate plot because its more about what Alex-Li non-discovers about himself than a progressive storyline.n our own lives and give us that other worldy hint to the big picture.  <BR><BR>Poor Alex has spent his whole life fantasizing about obtaining Kitty Alexander's autograph.

What a mistake -- what I thought was a speed read has developed into a full blown habit where I am quickly acquiring all the Harry Bosch novels and am detemined to read them in sequence.<br /><br />Admittedly, I read 'Lost Light' first when I should have read it last and now I know the bottom line regarding Bosch's personal life and the significance of the 'Lost Light' from a long range perspective.  Maybe a good thing  . . .<br /><br />In 'Lost Light', Bosch comes across as an angry outsider who has something to prove and doesn't give up when he thinks he is right.  No longer with the police department, he goes solo, investigating a cold case that he had been assigned to years before and then pulled off of when the murder became associated with a high profile robbery.  Something about the case sticks in Harry's mind and even a Bosch novice like myself recognizes the bulldog tenacity at work that is surely a Bosch trademark.  As Bosch comes closer to an answer, he is warned off by the usual-suspect bureaucrats who unlike Harry are unwilling to jeopardize their positions for the truth.  As Harry dodges bullets and mudslings designed to ruin his reputation once and for all, he finds solace in places that he thought were as cold as the murder itself.  The pieces fall into place almost haphazardly, the way they probably do in real police situations and Harry stumbles onto one too unexpected truths that rekindle that lost light in his own soul.<br /><br />Definitely recommended to all readers of Michael Connelly, but also to those who enjoy a fast paced novel set to jazz rhythms, shadowed by the darkness of the world of crime and its players and yet, over time also has the ability to completely and competantly explore a complex character who struggles with emotional holes to fill yet continues to perservere.  Although the novel has the strength of a stand alone, I recommend reading the books in order, to keep the names, places and Bosch history in proper perspective.p the names, places and Bosch history in proper perspective.	2004-04-16
US	53093124	R1SDAIN4DN67SW	044661162X	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Fun, Fast Compelling Read	Michael Connelly knows how to write a sleazy character and there are plenty of them to draw from in this quick read that leaves Harry Bosch's personal world but not the seedy underbelly of Bosch's stomping ground: Los Angeles.  Connelly combines the city with the latest popular novel hot topic: nanotechnology, as backdrop to his high speed narrative about a wunderkind emerging technologies geek and his race to create the next best thing in the hi tech world of computers and biomedicine.  Like Bosch, this one time Connelly protagonist, Henry Pierce works with a junkie's zeal, killing off all personal relationships with his hunger to &quot;chase the dime.&quot;  As he races towards fame and fortune, pulling all nighters in the lab while strategizing with his finacial team to belly up the next &quot;whale&quot; to finance the next round of research, he finds himself living alone in an apartment after his girlfriend has called it quits and thrown him out of the house they shared together.  His new digs comes with a new telephone number--- a phone number that once belonged to Lilly, one of LA's hottest but missing, Internet escorts.  For reasons that are sometimes hard to fathom, Henry choices to seek out Lilly and to explore her world in the process--his psychological past suggests a savior complex linked to an unclosed issue from childhood that prompt his rather self-destructive actions----and finds himself over his head in murky waters along with Lilly's corpse and circling sharks of two varieties, the kingpin purveyors of the Internet porn world and the LAPD.<br /><br />Like &quot;Void Moon&quot;, &quot;Chasing the Dime&quot; provides a fast read that will guarantee sleep deprivation as you tell yourself that you are going to read just one more page, or just one more chapter as the clock winds around to 3:00 in the morning.  Connelly just has 300+ pages to tell the tale and provide enough psychological background on the character to make his actions and motivations seem valid---whether or not he actually succeeds with the latter on this novel is debatable, but in the long run doesn't quite matter as the novel does what it intends to do---entertain and entertain well.  This is a slight predictability factor at work mid-way through the plot, but that detracts only a little from the overall success of a tale told well.  Recommended to all who enjoy a fast paced novel that takes no more than 2 days to read.valid---whether or not he actually succeeds with the latter on this novel is debatable, but in the long run doesn't quite matter as the novel does what it intends to do---entertain and entertain well.

It may help you avoid the typical and strive for something a little more nuanced -- outside the usual box.<br /><br />The authors mix and match 8 hero archetypes (the chief, the bad boy, the best friend, the charmer, the lost soul, the professor, the swashbuckler and the warrior) with 8 heroine archetypes (the boss, the seductress, the spunky kid, the free spirit, the waif, the librarian, the crusader and the nurturer) and come up with all the mathematically possible permutations along with hints about how to evolve characters with one main archetypal trait or characters with less definable layered archetypes. The authors freely use many familiar examples (not just tedious classic literary examples) to illustrate how such interactions successfully play off one another in today's popular films, books and television shows. (Ex:  In the movie Blade Runner, Harrison Ford is the Warrior while Darryl Hannah is the Waif.)<br />Indeed, many of the examples are stereotypical and when you read them your reaction will most likely be, &quot;Okay, this is a no brainer -- I am well aware of this archetype and can recognize it easily in film and books.&quot;  While this may be true, it is wonderful to have this book where all the archetypes are already laid out for you in a marvelously straightfoward format --  as a reference guide so that time spent pondering over the myriad of personality related intereactions can now be spent on crafting a story with great dialogue, settings, tone and plot instead of worrying wheither or not the characters mesh or not.  With this guide, that portion of the thinking is done for you -- you need only see what works for you by looking through the examples or by tweaking your characters after learning about certain reactions in order to facilitate outcomes primary to your plot.<br />  On a purely fun level, this book gets 5 stars.  I enjoyed categorizing the characters in the book and then applying the criteria to some of my own personal favorites.ng your characters after learning about certain reactions in order to facilitate outcomes primary to your plot.<BR>  On a purely fun level, this book gets 5 stars.

In &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; her highly lucrative formula of alternating chapters focusing on the varying third person perspectives works extremely well to keep the reader from guessing the identity of the murderer until Clark sees fit to reveal it at the very end of her story.<br /><br />The plot revolves around likeable call-in radio psychologist Susan Chandler who inadvertantly triggers a spree of seemingly unlinked killings when she decides to center a few of her broadcasts on the subject of disappearing women, in particular Regina Clausen, a leading financial analyst who disappeared 4 years earlier without a trace while on a cruise in the Far East. As readers, we get a glimpse into the mind of the murderer as he himself listens to the show and strategizes to keep his overall plan a secret by eliminating people who simply get in his way.  We are privy to police investigations, and the ruminations of private eyes and eye witnesses. We walk for a while in the shoes of intended victims and share their horror as the murderer moves along his amoral course without regrets.  We uncover facts about Dr Susan, immediately understanding that she is undergoing some personal problems of her own regarding her parent's divorce and her father's subsequent marriage to someone she dislikes; her mother's ensueing depression and her sister's angry betrayals.  Most entertaining is guessing which of the three men linked to Dr. Susan personally is our deranged serial killer and what motivation has provoked such a terrible vengenance.<br /><br />Clark doesn't disappoint, she keeps you interested until the last page.  As in her other novels, none of the characters are really developed---there are so many of them---it would be difficult to analyze each of them thoroughly and stay within the 300+ page parameter of the popular novel.  Nevertheless, the momentum of the story allows you to overlook the lack of indepth characterization.  Indeed the story itself is the strongest character as is the backdrop of New York and its world of traffic, crowds and taxi rides.<br /><br />Recommended to all lovers of suspense who like a contained story where all loose ends are tied at the climax and denouement in a lovely logical bow.the story allows you to overlook the lack of indepth characterization.

Connelly masterfully hints at a past that while memorable is also painful and retribution seeking.<br /><br />Grant you, Connelly does not have the luxury of developing Cassie's character over a series of books as he does in his Harry Bosch novels, but within the 300+ pages, the reader gets a satisfactory portrayal of a woman in transition.<br /><br />Cassie, an ex-con, works in a Porsche dealership in the L.A. that Connelly uses as a backdrop in most of his novels.  The routine of her job combined with her regular parole visits jolt suddenly when she discovers that another far more important and unrevealed portion of her routine will be disrupted.  In an instant, the old need for what Connelly describes as &quot;outlaw juice&quot; hits her, and she decides that instead of the quiet life of the reformed thief, she desires nothing more than to go back to her old life of precarious excitement in Las Vegas.  She makes the connections she needs with the precision of a Swiss watch, and within days a job is set into motion that places Cassie in the path of Jack Karch, one of Connelly's sleazier villians in an already excellent portfolio of the underworld's sleaziest characterizations.<br /><br />I'll admit that when the story switches from the third person Cassie Black viewpoint to that of Jack Karch, I was a little disappointed as the direction in which the novel heads becomes easier to track.  But Connelly keeps up the pace and I found myself reading page after page until at 3 AM I finished the book and decidedly spent the ensuing day happily sleep deprived.  Once Jack rears his ugly head, the story catapults into a satisfying tale of &quot;the caper&quot; with all the adrenaline inducing charge of film stories like &quot;The Italian Job&quot; or &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; told in the more world weary underbelly of Las Vegas and L.A. while still maintaing its ability to depict a complex animal like Karch and reveal all his Freudian impulses in a complete and unboring fashion.<br /><br />I will not reveal the plot; its certainly provides enough entertainment for anyone who enjoys probing the psyches of the amoral within the confines of a fast-paced popular novel.  While the overall outcome of the story could be worked out by the reader, the manner in which it all is accomplished is successfully employed by Connelly and the outcome provides an entertaining respite from the reader's routine world.  Recommended to all who like a quick well-done suspenseful read where there is no need to lessen the pace to look up a word in the dictionary.his Freudian impulses in a complete and unboring fashion.  <BR><BR>I will not reveal the plot; its certainly provides enough entertainment for anyone who enjoys probing the psyches of the amoral within the confines of a fast-paced popular novel.

The books trade paperback format devotes a full page to each proverb and provides a clever cartoon and a little story in French, some in the form of a dialogue, to further illustrate the proverb's meaning.<br />  All proverbs are grouped in the following categories: Our Animal Friends---proverbs containing similes likening human behavior to that of domestic animals, Animals in the Wild----human behavior likened to non-domestic animals, Occupations---Behaviors attributed to certain occupations, Eating in Style --- proverbs where food positively and negatively reflects life, Life Day by Day---axioms to make daily life livable, People --- of the &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot; genre, The Blue Planet --- proverbs involving a natural setting, Time Flies --- common sense sayings revolving around duration and time of day and Words to Live By --- A catch-all category for those proverbs that defy categorization. At the end of the volume, each of the 101 illustrative stories and dialogues are translated in English.  At the tail end, the proverbs are listed alphabetically in French with corresponding page numbers.<br /><br />This book is simply great--its a lot of fun, and can be used almost like a calendar where one page is read and savored a day.  The use of idioms is extensive and can be used to further anyone's study of everyday French.<br /><br />Recommended to all students of French who want to interject a little fun into their grammar and vocabulary memorization.	2004-03-28

On solely a practical level what this means is that only one fourth of the book will be read by you---why D'Adamo doesn't simply offer 4 books at a fourth of the price, I'll never know.  The fourth of the book that you will read pretty much duplicates what is written in 'Eat Right for Your Type','Live Right for Your Type' and 'The Eat Right for your Type Encyclopedia'.  In this book, D'Adamo adds 2 new food categories to the triumvate of BENEFICIAL, NEUTRAL and AVOID categories found in the older editions.  One of the new food categories--Super Beneficial further delineates the already restrictive ground he has already covered at length in his earlier books.  A few new vegetables and spices are added in the newer categories, but otherwise the directives found in his earlier work still define the underlying principles in this one.<br /><br />So the really bottom line on this one is whether or not you really need to purchase a $20 book to further affirm D'Adamo's thinking on food and supplements.  I think not.  Whether or not you accept the idea that observing blood type and D'Adamo's corresponding food do's and don't's is the key to a longer and healthier life will definitely sway you in either making or not making this purchase. Do remember this:  the Blood Type Diet is a business where D'Adamo sells rather expensive vitamins (he actually sells a backdoor product called Deflect which supposedly eliminates lectins in the system from AVOID foods) and supplements as well as protein shake mixes he says are optimally designed for each of the 4 blood types.  But what if he's wrong?  For my blood type I am supposed to eat lots of tofu and soy products---but alas, this food gives me headaches---a fact that I have tested through a strict elimination process--so if the premise is true, there most be a missing component that even D'Adamo's secretor non/secretor test does not take into account. Either his categories are too general or they are just incorrect. Perhaps good old common sense comes into play here:  if eating tomatoes causes hives, simply don't eat them.  Look at things on an individual basis and eat in moderation.<br /><br />Recommended only to strict D'Adamo fans who just want a new but unnecessary version of the same information at their fingertips.y products---but alas, this food gives me headaches---a fact that I have tested through a strict elimination process--so if the premise is true, there most be a missing component that even D'Adamo's secretor non/secretor test does not take into account.

The readings and exercises in each topic range from easy to advanced, so the student can challenge him/herself on any or all levels.  For example, the topic on food begins with a chef's vocabulary--describing his uniform and his equipment--this is followed by an interesting exercise on homonyms and several sentences in English requiring French translation.  Recipe instructions follow explaining the French usage of either the imperative form of the verb or the use of the infinitive (I found this section very informative--all the verbs for mixing, beating, whisking etc are used in one place in the two formats--one formal, one more familiar.  The chapter ends with more articles---a portrait of a chef, an interview with a chef, Food Critics, Table Manners, A Moroccan Menu and a short essay about enjoying the pleasures of life.  All articles are intermingled with exercises of increasing difficulty that are interesting to the modern reader.  Although the author does include reading selections from authors of the Baudelaire, George Sand and Chateaubriand calibar, there are plenty of articles reprinted from current magazines and newspapers to make the experience of learning from &quot;Better Reading French&quot; one of practical everyday usage.<br /><br />Recommended to any intermediate French student who enjoys exploring different avenues of independent study while accomplishing the noble goal of learning, perfecting or simply maintaing their French.or simply maintaing their French.	2004-03-28

The back of the book is devoted to an English-French and French-English Glossary list as well as idiomatic usage of the verbs and specific situation topics like &quot;talking about the weather&quot; or &quot;buying a train ticket&quot;.<br /><br />My one complaint about this series is the lack of English translation especially for tricky verbs like savoir, pouvoir, vouloir and devoir which when conjugated in the different tenses take on different meanings in English.  More explanation should be devoted to these verbs, perhaps in the form of further examples.  I think it would suffice if English translations of the all tenses of the verbs were simply listed next to their French counterparts.  The author does discuss each of the tenses at length in the front part of the book, but for quick look-up purposes, this does not work well.	2004-03-13

Anna's a tough old bird, forgive the pun, but it adequately describes a woman that has ridden a hellish emotional rollercoaster and now seeks the sanctity of Mother Nature in America's natural park preserves rather than deal with the predictable, shallow and disillusioning civilization.<br /><br />Pigeon finds herself on loan in Glacier National Park, working with bear research expert Joan Rand, a motherly French Canadian who gets her kicks out of collecting bear DNA in the form of hair and scat while traipsing off-trail from one research planted bear lure to another.  Joining them is Rory Van Sladt, a teenager with little desire or forestry experience other than his affiliation with a ecological preservation society--this most likely prompted by a desire to spruce up his college applications with prerequisite volunteer work.<br /><br />When Rory's stepmother is found in the Park murdered and supposedly mauled by a bear, Anna's powers of perception kick in and amidst the backdrop of beautifully detailed descriptions of Glacier, she must pull every bit of information gleaned from her first day on the trail to a near death experience involving an extraordinary bear and her water bottle, in order to defend the benevolent character of her beloved natural sanctuary.<br /><br />Anna's character, although funny at times, borders on the cynical for the majority of the story. Barr illustrates Pigeon's suspicious nature, her insensitivity and her definite non-maternal tendencies in scenes where she teases Rory unmercifully regarding his fear of bears, later during her interrogation of Rory and his father and throughout the novel as she ponders the ersatz worthlessness of modern life.  But, Barr is apparently quite wise, and allows Anna a redemption of sorts when the story reaches its wonderfully magical climax in a setting fit for the best of fairytales.  Happily, this bit of charm comes as a total surprise, for me perhaps because I had never read Barr before, for other veteran readers, it may be the norm in such exquisite settings.<br /><br />I listened to an unabridged format of this story issued by Recorded Books--the preformer adequately brings to life the characters of Joan, Rory, and especially Anna.  I recommend it for all who are intrigued by mysteries taking place within the National Park community and most certainly for all lovers of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series.ppily, this bit of charm comes as a total surprise, for me perhaps because I had never read Barr before, for other veteran readers, it may be the norm in such exquisite settings.<BR><BR>I listened to an unabridged format of this story issued by Recorded Books--the preformer adequately brings to life the characters of Joan, Rory, and especially Anna.

Hougan's main man in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Jack Dunphy has been relegated to glorified information gopher at Langley after having been pulled off an undercover assignment in London after the death of an Oxford Professor of Jungian psychology whom he had under surveillance.  Dunphy's annoyance at being yanked from his cozy nest with British sweetie Clementine enhanced by the frustratingly endless grunt work of public information gathering lead him to buck the system and uncover the relevance of the professor's death.  What he discovers is a Gordian knot of intrigue that eventually threatens his life and the lives of anyone with whom he comes into contact.<br /><br />As Dunphy plows through clues that take him all over Europe, the reader breathlessly turns page after page, liking Dunphy and his cohorts immediately.  The facts that he uncovers make for fascinating reading---puzzlers will enjoy being thrown information seemingly straight out of left field.  Unfortunately, as the story leads into its ultimate denouement, it becomes choppy, the ending sequences beginning at the estate within the Swiss National Park and the ending voyage at sea seem rushed and not fully thought out, as if the author had run out of steam and simply wanted to finish the story under 400 pages.  The last paragraph leads the reader to believe some sort of transference has taken place, but obviously this is certainly not developed and there seems no hint of a part two where the reader can stretch his imagination further.<br /><br />Kingdom Come utilizes themes that have become familiar territory after the publication of the very popular &quot;DaVinci Code&quot;.  But in as much as that novel also rushes the reader in and out of intriguing snippets of history replete with secret societies, it does come to a fairly complete, if not predictable, conclusion--not so with &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;---the protoganists accomplish their missions, but the ending seems to grasp at something not quite touched upon in the main body of the work.  I would have liked to have read more information regarding the gentleman introduced at the tail end of the novel, perhaps even a concurrent historical story running parallel to the actual action tale.  Perhaps then, I would have felt that the ending had some meaning in terms of this gentleman's characterization and overall fit into the overall scheme of things.  The focus should have been on him and not the Pound/Dulles affair showcased by the author.  As with the &quot;John Case&quot; selections, Hougan again seems to fall into the trap of simply using his book to over-instruct his readers on trivia that while fun has little to do with the overall outcome of the story.  Providing a reading guide at the back of the book would definitely be a plus for those readers who want more information and do wish to read further.<br /><br />Nevertheless Hougan presents a great page-turner for at least 7/8's of the book's journey and I will recommend it with some reluctance to anyone who likes a quick read with some fun historical mysteries thrown in.story replete with secret societies, it does come to a fairly complete, if not predictable, conclusion--not so with &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;---the protoganists accomplish their missions, but the ending seems to grasp at something not quite touched upon in the main body of the work.

Each tip is assigned a three digit number which is nicely cross-referenced in the back in a thorough index.  All of the tips are grouped under the following twelve chapter headings: Articles, Object Pronouns, Relative Pronouns, Passe Compose and Imperfect, Agreement of Participles, Reflexives, Passive Tense, Subjunctive, Interrogation, Certain Effects of Certain Verbs in Certain Tenses and Moods, Faire, Falloir, S'Agir and Time.<br /> In addition to concise information, formatted in an almost encyclopedic style, Susskind sprinkles his French gems with a liberal coating of humor and grammar usage illustrating his points with actual sentences.  My only complaint here is the lack of English translation for all the sentences however simplistic.  I realize that Susskind intends the book for advanced students who have already encountered rigorous grammar exercises and can easily recognize the sore subjects Susskind so thoughtfully summarizes with a knowing wince, but I do think that a beginning and most definitely an intermediate student will benefit greatly from this compendium.  My absolute favorite chapter is Certain Effects of Certain Verbs etc. where Susskind turns his attention to the devoir, pouvoir, vouloir, and savoir and explains their usage in the different tenses with English translations.  This is most appreciated!  Kudos Mr. Susskind	2004-03-10

Iles offers no revelations about them as people, nor does he tweak the usual formulaic chase scenes and behind the main action narratives where we get a glimpse into the minds of the opposition, with any intriguing plot twists.  Iles touches on a few themes that could have changed the book's overall feel and tone, but like most thriller/suspense novels that capture the general public's attention, this one seems to move in the direction of adaptability to screenplay rather than a vehicle that could make us actually think.<br /><br />And---its not as if Iles does not possess the skills, he has a moment where as Christ he answers a question with a riddle from St. Thomas' Gospel (Dead Sea Scroll): &quot;Split a piece of wood, and I am there.  Lift up the stone and find me.&quot;  If Iles really wanted to follow in the footsteps of God, why didn't he make a quantum physics connection to this cryptic statement?  Most likely, the answer is a simple one---many of these new science based novels start out with a Big Bang of golly-wow information that peters out simply because the cutting edge technology spoken about isn't fully understood or isn't advanced enough to provide startling revelations.<br /><br />On another level, the broad threat to international security scope of this novel was just too big to lend any insight into inner mystery.  The focus on the disabling of nuclear warheads and the annoying worthless interplay between Geli Bauer and her father, the General, takes up more than half the book.  In addition, the hokey ending ala 'Contact' meets &quot;The Wiz&quot; disappointed rather than impressed this reader.  Tennant's enlightenment seemed, pardon me, an inexcusable Deus ex machina ; his grim demeanor counteracts his common sense message to the computer at the novel's denouement.  While Ile's comments regarding the nature of Christ will surely supercharge Christian fundamentalists, they surely won't get the air-time of the more popular &quot;DaVinci Code.&quot; Tsk,tsk---even when trying to be upbeat, Iles crumbles under his self-created burdens--putting too much action in what could have been a cerebral experience--- my overall rating is not even a C minus.uot;Split a piece of wood, and I am there.

Who can resist the spell that Mary Stewart weaves in one of her best novels?<br />Not a soul.<br />Technically, 'The Moonspinners' has all the right ingredients, beginning with a fantastically deceptive setting--the untamed Cretan countryside, described to perfection with its whirling white-sailed windmills, its craggy landscape peppered with enough fragrant wildflowers to fill Dioscorides' Greek Herbal and its people, proud, fiercely patriotic, bravely bearing the scars of war and the miseries of a sparse existence.<br />The protagonists are charmingly intrepid, managing to keep their British stiff upper lips intact even in the face of a wildly unstable group of gun-happy thugs-turned kidnappers. Our narrator is a deliciously innocent, well-meaning and attractive vacationer, Nicola Ferris, (think Elizabeth Shue in 'The Saint' not perky Hayley Mills who in the movie of the same name was a burgeoning adolescent--this Nicola is a consummate situation-manager on a mission, accustomed to controlling her life and the people around her)who in refusing to back out of an affair she unwittingly steps into, discovers the one situation she cannot manage without help. It takes the handsome stranger, in the guise of competent English tourist Mark Langley (and yes, a young Peter McEnery will do quite,) to turn the tables on her while pressing her into a less dominant role that she finds she actually likes. Mark's teenaged brother, the kidnapped Colin and his clever forays into the stranger world of British slang, provides an effective comedic foil for the straight-laced Mark and his Greek counterpart, the English-idiom-challenged caique-owner, Lambis. The insiduous-pallikarathes villan, Stratos, one part charm to two parts unstable lethal weapon, the slithering eel-like Tony, and sadly-complaisant, hard-working Sofia, round up the players along with Nicola's older but wiser cousin, Frances.<br />Don't miss this one--the prose alone will have you chucking your stalward life and buying a Greek wildflower guide along with a one-way ticket to Crete just to stand in the presence of those languidly spinning windmills!ng a Greek wildflower guide along with a one-way ticket to Crete just to stand in the presence of those languidly spinning windmills!	2004-03-09

The well meaning scientists, the crazed mercenaries, the bewildered civilians and the villians---tons of ready-made living dinosaur meat cultivated from Jurassic era DNA?  All this made for a good story and a fully blown cinematic spectacle when the creatures were brought to life on the big screen.<br /><br />That's pretty much the tale of Prey---instead of dinosaurs, the menace consists of a &quot;swarm&quot; of nano-sized computers created by a Silcon Valley hardware/software company that again have gotten out of control.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person by Jack, the husband and temporary Mr. Mom of his family---wife Julia works tediously long hours at Xymos---the computer firm experimenting with nanotechnology.  Jack senses something odd about his wife's newly found vehemence for her job and suspects an extramarital affair.  It is only when he is hired as a consultant to iron out some of the bugs in software procedures written by a team he managed at another company and purchased by Xymos to perfect the project Julia is heading, that he gets a glimmer of what really is going on inside of his wife's head.<br /><br />With his usual finesse, Mr. Crichton does an admirable job of presenting a difficult subject in language that a layperson can appreciate--if not fully understand.  Of all of his most recent offerings, 'Prey' demands the reader's partial comprehension of the essence of nanotechnology to at least authenticate the book's premise.  Jack speaks computer-ese easily, but if you are not at least familiar with older programming techniques you will find the differences that Jack accentuates in his explanations regarding goal-oriented programming as opposed to parallel programming, downright unfamiliar territory.<br /><br />Otherwise, the plot follows the usual techno-suspense formula--the reader finds himself/herself turning pages at rapid fire speed as the characters combat a force that they created but no longer can control.  I found myself speed-reading to learn more about the science itself which Crichton expertly weaves in with his action-packed storyline.  The actual denouement borders on the predictable---updating the Frankenstein story with all its frightening repercussions---arrogant man infinging on a Nature that he does not fully understand yet feels confident in altering.<br /><br />Recommended to those who like cutting edge science and a fast paced story.ontrol.

All of Case's books, 'The Genesis Code', 'The Syndrome' and 'The First Horse' as well as this one, utilize the same winning formula which seems to be working so well for Dan Brown in 'The DaVinci Code' and &quot;Angels and Demons.&quot;  A little technology is combined with myth, religion and human greed to create a fast-paced page-turner that is sure to please most recreational readers.<br /><br />In this offering, Case launches artist and part-time investigator Cray into the spheres of influence controlled by a Turkish billionaire---the trail begins with a professor of ancient religions committing suicide in Washington DC and quickly leads tracking a laptop computer to the Eternal City, meeting the billionaire at a fabulous party during the famous Palio in Siena and then proceeds at a lightning pace in a run-for-your-life dash for Istanbul and Eastern Turkey to uncover a plot that leads back to the mysteries of the Silicon Valley in California.<br /><br />I found the Italian and Turkish portions of the book thoroughly enjoyable; the science presented during Cray's dinner in California interesting but a little secondary to the overall plot---I felt as if the authors wanted to get in a little something about nanotechnology---which they do very well, but needlessly, as the science itself has little to do with any pivotal moments in the storyline.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, the authors stretch the limits of coincidence, their melding of science within the plot was shaky and Cray's most perplexing moments (i.e. puzzling out the professor's password)were annoying to read as they were easily remembered by the reader.<br /><br />But like &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, this book is out and out fun to read.  Cray is likeable, we find ourselves rooting for him; we want him to convince his girlfriend of his innocence and we want his art show to be a success because we know he isn't a very good private investigator.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who found &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; enjoyable.because we know he isn't a very good private investigator.<BR><BR>Recommended to anyone who found &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; enjoyable.	2004-03-05

Blake tells his story from many, mainly Indian perspectives:  Ten Bears, the senior member of the village, who although intrigued by the marvel of the spectacles that somehow &quot;make his eyes young again&quot;,can never forego his free life on the Plains---- Smiles Alot, the young horse whisperer who through the tragedy that befalls the village, finds his place as a brave warrior and wins the girl of his dreams---Kicking Bird, the one Indian who wants to understand the whites, thinks white technological advancements may actually help his people---Wind-in-his-hair, born a warrior, he prefers to die free and wild rather than ever acquiesce to the whites and Dances With Wolves and his family--Stands With a Fist and their three children who have eschewed the ways of their cultural pasts for the communal mystery that embraces all the Commanches.  Even though the outcome has been dictated by history, Blake does a great job of telling a story befitting the best campfire.  He does not overlook the details, but rather allows us entry into each of the Indian minds --- we smile as an Indian delegation goes by train to Washington and one of the members has a panic attack as the train goes into a tunnel; we feel the pain of Dances with Wolves when white rangers intercept Stands With a Fist and try to reunite her with her blood relatives--we cringe along with Ten Bears as he discovers the way white men &quot;make meat&quot; and shutter when Smiles Alot and his family are carted off to the white man's jail. The amalgamated story wonderfully provides us with a piece of each of the Indian spirit that fits together to form a rich tapestry of the village life.  Although it ends sadly, describing a retricted life on a reservation, I found myself thinking about those huge Indian casinos that are now as fascinating to the whites as the buffalo tongues once were.<br /><br />I listened to this story on audio cassette---it was the perfect mixture of good plot and simplistic style that allowed me to concentrate on my exercise and follow the story at the same time.

If the action in &quot;And then You Die&quot; could be deemed Zen's recuperation period after the devastating events of Sicily, &quot;Medusa&quot; demonstrates a Zen well again, and indeed up to his old unscrupulous tricks, but still feeling the pressures of his ordeal.<br /><br />Dibdin concentrates more on his secondary cast in this police procedural involving the discovery by a group of Austrian spelunkers of the body of a soldier thought to have been killed 30 years earlier in a freak airplane accident.  Dibdin excels in depicting the various Italian agencies scrambling to cover-up an affair they don't quite understand, but fully recognize as having the potential to disclose a little too much of their own corruptness. In addition Dibdin's psychological portrayals of the individual members of Medusa, the elite military force to which the dead man once belonged, smack with realism; I especially enjoyed lonely Gabriele who wants nothing more than to live in the world of his antiquarian bookstore---he reminded me of the &quot;rat man&quot; in &quot;A Long Finish&quot;.  In addition, Naldino, the socialistic restaurant owner gives new meaning to the term &quot;confused anger&quot; and Claudia is just as snakey as an aging femme fatale as the Gorgon of the title.<br />Intermingled within these portraits of the past, Medusa gives us glimpses of Zen harriedly and conscientiously  boarding trains all over the north of Italy from Florence to Campione d'Italie near Switzerland.  Obviously, he has not lost his doggedness or his world-weariness---he works through the quagmire of politicism as only an Italian can---he solves the case employing the most unorthodox methods while pursuing leads, chain-smoking and drinking enough coffee and grappa to fuel an entire Starbucks and receiving an unexpected &quot;atta-boy&quot; from his superior in the end.  Something tells me that in a future installment, Gemma, the new lady in Zen's life, just may iron out some of his cynicism and infuse him with some enthusiasm that could, while letting his guard down, get him into some hilarious form of trouble.  A pity she only has a cameo role in this one.<br />Nevertheless, it is so good to see Zen on the prowl again in a new well-paced story set against the backdrop of exquisite Italian scenery still somehow not tainted by the knowledge of what goes on behind the Italian government machine.  I would love to see Zen on the silver screen--I'd even raise a glass of grappa to that!<br />Recommended to all Zen lovers.

How many students of foreign language have resorted to sign language or &quot;baby&quot; parlance to simply express an otherwise basic thought in English into reasonably intelligent French?  In 20 interesting units,this wonderful vocabulary book delivers where so many other thematic vocabulary books merely skim the surface. The units include such topics as: shapes, patterns, containers, sports, science, art, history, politics, buildings, personalities and body parts to just name a few. If you are an intermediate or advanced student, you will fully take advantage of this great text, complete with level one through three vocabulary, formatted by theme and followed by beaucoup de exercises to help you read, translate, and puzzle out intricacies of the French language. The vocabulary includes nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs as well as idiomatic phrases that will help you perfect your skills.<br /><br />Of course, no such book is complete, but the format provides plenty of space for you to insert your own findings as you read and look up more specific words in a good dictionary.  Nevertheless, each topic will provide you with plenty of interesting and diverse ways of expressing yourself---be it in an essay or in a conversation.  My one fault with the book is its lack of an English to French Index in a smaller font as an appendix. Otherwise, recommended heartily as one of the best French learning guides I have.	2004-01-03

Gaiman's premise sparks with imagination---as I am unfamiliar with most of the writers that he thanks in his Acknowledgements---as to whether or not it is his own imagination or that of others, I am not sure.  The main character, ex-con,Shadow, seems like a nice enough guy who reads Heroditus and has garnered quite a few other literary allusions even though we are told that his education is basic.  On the eve of his release from prison, he discovers his wife has died in a car accident, a little later on in the story he learns that she died in the company of her lover, Shadow's friend.  With this crushing truth weighing down upon him, Shadow meets and accepts a job with Mr. Wednesday, a man who seems to turn up when you least expect him and knows a little too much about Shadow's life.  Suddenly, Shadow finds himself immersed in a battle royal in which Wednesday and an assortment of odd characters struggle to maintain some hold on an America they were forced to voyage to while in the believing minds of Old Country immigrants.  Wednesday and his cronies are the old gods---Odin, Bast, and a cast of others---old, cranky and disillusioned by their diminished presence in American life as they are rapidly replaced by new gods of technology, wealth and power.  Wednesday tells Shadow that \\"a war is coming\\"--a war in which the two will battle for supremacy.<br /><br />Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, it is in parts.  I found Shadow's sojourn into the small lakeside town in Michigan throughly entertaining--in fact if Gaiman had concentrated his efforts on making that his major plot, I think he could have successfully spun off all of his major themes in a more concise and precise manner that would not have left the reader scratching his head at major points in the story.  Not being that well-versed with some of the gods and legends that Gaiman alludes to, I would have found an appendix detailing some of the minor aspects of this lore paramount to my understanding and enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />After reading this nearly 600 pager, I regret to say that I don't think that there was much to ponder over, other than the rather obvious message that American life is consummed with immediate success and gratification rather than those which are founded on ritual and tradition. Shadow's role is never fully defined; other than his experience on the tree, he is very American; voyeur rather than participator---he may feel more alive, but what he does with that life, the story never defines.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Many of the other reviewers claim that Gaiman is a better comic book writer than a novelist.  I have not read his Sandman series, but I have read some good graphic novels that promote conversations and make good observations on modern and not-so-modern life in an entertaining way.  On a whole this book, does not do this.  A good premise basically goes wasted.  The tale of Hinklemann and the one untainted town in Michigan should have been given a little more detail and basically the same story could have been told with more impact.

However, as I read further, each chapter waffles back and forth between Inman and his lady, Ada, I found that Frazier's heavily detailed narrative, indeed grew on me.  Trailers of the upcoming movie, piqued my interest with regard to obvious movie romance, and I read rather impatiently to find some sense of this &quot;great love&quot; within the pages of the book.  Indeed I did find it---and along the way, enjoyed thoroughly the odyssey of Inman's journey back to his faithful, albeit not-so-competent Penelope.<br /><br />Frazier brings up many themes, most memorable the utter destruction of war within the spirit of a man; but more lyrically he tells a tale of the American Appalacians---the hard working mountain dwellers and their steadfast beliefs and downright admirable perserverance.  Each chapter brings to life new characters in an Uncle Remus-like simplicity that is not only effective but beautiful.<br /><br />Inman's eventual reunion with his barely-known love is worth waiting for---the ending could have been happier, but is in keeping with the moving-on sense of each of the main characters.	2003-12-17

US	53093124	R3Q10XJC1PTZ97	0440048141	853845780	The lion of Delos	Books	3	3	4	N	Y	Young Adult Read that Lacks Substance	I was recommended this book by a member of the Mary Stewart Yahoo Group; I suppose that because of the locale--the Greek Island of Mykonos and neighboring archeological site, Delos---this book was thought comparable to one of Mary Stewart's suspense gems.  Unfortunately, it was not.<br /><br />The premise of the book revolves around pale and pretty identical twin, Virginia receiving a letter from her sister Lee, living and running a tourist boutique on Mykonos.  It seems that Lee has run into trouble, and then suddenly drops off the face of the earth.  A distraught and concerned Virginia rushes to the rescue and along the way encounters a rather unsavory group of people that somehow fit in with her sister's disappearance.  The love interest appears early on in the personage of an overly helpful fellow tourist whose motivation isn't Virginia's pretty face, but rather her resemblance to her sister.  The nebulous search for Lee leads Virgina and her friend to uncover a plot to remove one of the famous lions of Delos off the island of Delos by a Midas-rich American for his own private collection.<br /><br />In the hands of a more adept writer, this novel could have contained all the right ingredients for an enjoyable read, the foreign locale, the ever present sense of worry and danger and the attractive engaging characters.  However, in the hands of this writer, all the components lack energy, Mykonos does not sparkle in the sun as a unique jewel in the Aegean; the boutique could have been on any island in any country; the sparse descriptions are as devoid of flavor as a serving of wilted moussaka served in too much olive oil.  Virginia worries excessively; her attraction to Nat seems contrived rather than the result of a natural progression where a dangerous uncertain situation brings two people together.  Nat is a little too blaise, or maybe, he's just a little too 70s laid-back? There is far too much lame dialogue and aloud speculations about Lee's disappearance instead of out and out action to steer the reader towards moments of real suspense or towards forming important conclusions.  Overall the novel lacks the sophistication to put it in the category of fine suspense fiction.  I also detect a feminist undercurrent (not as blatant) which reminded me of early Barbara Michaels, in particular the rather dated albeit more cleverly crafted &quot;The Sea King's Daughter&quot;.  Unfortunately, The Lion of Delos fails in all comparisons with the works of Mary Stewart; I would recommend this book instead, to young adult readers or fans of Phyllis Whitney or Dorothy Eden who like their suspense in the older Gothic styles of the 60s and 70s.out and out action to steer the reader towards moments of real suspense or towards forming important conclusions.

It is extremely light on grammar and concentrates mainly on providing the student with 1000+ vocabulary words that can be used in certain simple sentence structures. However, I believe the book's claim---you will be able to communicate in French as a tourist or business traveller, if you actually memorize the entire book and understand the grammar within its pages---to be true. But whether or not you will be able to accomplish this by using this book alone is debateable.  Firstly, there is no accompanying CDROM to help with pronunciation and the author does not provide any phonetic spellings to help the student sound out the word in the correct way.  Secondly some of the idioms used within the chapters are never adequately defined.  The vocabulary is grouped thematically, but all this means is that you may find the word &quot;Voiture&quot; for car in a section that teaches the present tense.  Adrienne summarizes all vocabulary in a French-English glossary at the end of the book, but completely omits the all important English-French section that is imperative for a language neophyte.  Thirdly, the book covers the present, the future, and the pass&eacute; compos&eacute; but completely omits any discussion of the imperfait or pass&eacute; simple.  It is a beginning book, but these tenses should be, at least mentioned.<br /><br />I bought this book because I liked the way it handled expressions that are needed for everyday conversation but are not always included in other beginning or intermediate books.  For example, if I wanted to say &quot;I am in the middle of eating&quot; or &quot;We were about to leave&quot; or &quot;How often do you go to class?&quot;. this book provides the means of expressing these sorts of indefinite ideas like &quot;already&quot;, &quot;not yet&quot;, &quot;no longer&quot; and &quot;still&quot; that we use all the time in English, but have no clue on a beginners level of how to express in French.<br /><br />Bottom line:  the book contains some hidden gems, but you must look for them and be at a point where you need little explanation; if you are not at a conversational level, or are strictly a beginner, purchase one of the more popular workbooks that includes a CDROM for pronunciation.<BR><BR>Bottom line:  the book contains some hidden gems, but you must look for them and be at a point where you need little explanation; if you are not at a conversational level, or are strictly a beginner, purchase one of the more popular workbooks that includes a CDROM for pronunciation.	2003-10-30

The only witnesses are Londoners, Vanessa March, and her companion teenaged Tim Lacy thrown together by chance as Tim pursues his dream of untying his mother's apron strings by applying for a job at the famous riding school and Vanessa searches for her errant husband, Lewis, supposedly away on business in Sweden, but documented on a UK newsreel with a beautiful blonde during an out of control circus fire near Graz.<br /><br />As usual, Mary Stewart creates a fine story where intrepid characters move along a lushly described exotic locale. The delineation between good and evil is clearly defined.  Like the other Stewart heroines, Charity Selbourne of 'Madame Will You Talk' comes quickly to mind, Vanessa unhesitatingly does the 'right thing.'  Although she has the stereotypical loveliness, intelligence, and quick wittedness with a bit of the acerbic tongue of a married woman that makes her narration marvelously fun, she is never obssessed with superficiality like so many more modern 'romance' heroines.  But, of course, a Stewart romance is a romance of the most highly literal type; the love scenes are suggested rather than depicted. The narration moves you along as if you were one and the same as the heroine; you breath her air, your heart clenches with terror when hers does, your skin prickles when in the presence of the ethereal and you quickly adopt and share her high value system.  Above all the atmosphere of magic liberally sprinkling the air is maintained throughout so that even the most coincidental and improbable happenings seem to gel and fit with a puzzler's adept precision. When the tale draws to an end, you sigh with disappointment at turning that last page and you wish that Stewart had written three times as many novels so you had more to rediscover.<br /><br />I listened to the audio presentation of this novel read by Jane Asher; it is very well-done, well worth the investment to listen to over and over again and see that poignant image of the horse dancing alone in the meadow just one more time in your mind's eye.

US	53093124	R2WYPCSX3LTUHP	0156006391	937190844	The Seville Communion	Books	4	55	57	N	Y	Wonderful	When an ingenious hacker infiltrates the Vatican's computer system and leaves a message on the Pope's desktop imploring the Vatican to save the soon-to-be demolished Our Lady of the Tears church in Seville, the Vatican deploys its version of a special operations expert in the formidable personage of Fr. Lorenzo Quart.  Quart is handsome, rugged and epitomizes the business end of the Vatican while promoting a no-nonsense vision of the Church in Rome that exactly opposes the cozy sanctuary feel of Our Lady of the Tears.  The congregation of the old and crumbling church believe that the building itself has an uncanny sense of survival; two murders or accidents have already taken place; the victims, people involved in the church's scheduled demolition.  World-toughened Quart believes no such thing, he attributes the church's strange staying power to its motley crew of supporters: an old renegade pastor, his young computer-savy associate, a art-restoring nun from California, a willful yet beautiful aristocrat and her old-fashioned mother with a fetish for Coca Cola.  The opposition is just as real--a jilted banker amd his hilarious stoogelike henchmen who envision a more self-serving and lucrative edifice on the Our Lady of Tears property.<br /><br />The plot however is secondary in this most wonderful of character studies.  As Quart discovers the different truths that center around the old church, he ekes out the meaning that the Church has not only for its individual protectors, but also for himself.  Like any truely good piece of literature the main character undergoes some metamorphosis; Quart's is profound and well worth the read through the stirring backdrop of beautiful Seville.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I find the \\"Seville Communion\\" incompariable when looked at in the same context as \\"The Flanders Panel\\" and \\"Club Dumas\\".  While I liked these other novels, I was moved by the Seville Communion and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys their characters made of flesh and blood, not just stereotypical ideals.made of flesh and blood, not just stereotypical ideals.	2003-10-27

I wanted a book in French without the cutsy pictures and the comic book mentality of some of the more well-known workbooks on the market and focused mainly on the desire of obtaining a no-nonsense review of the French language that I could use as a self-learning tool. I found this book provided a good initial overview that I could use in conjunction with other French learning tools and a native French teacher.  It is by no means the only book I would use.<br /><br />I like this book's format; each chapter begins with a grouping of vocabulary words, verbs and expressions that are used within the chapter in a dialogue and as an introduction to the expression usage and grammar that follows.  Exercises follow and yes, they implement structures and words that are not yet covered, but as with any other language book, this does not befuddle the learner into a stupor that disallows him from getting the point of the exercise.  Besides, that is what the dictionary is for.<br /><br />I doubt if this is the only book I would purchase if I were totally ignorant of the language and my pursuit of learning French was realistic.  It is one of many books that I own to get certain points across and inside my dull foreign language impaired brain.  I like the fact that specific situations like 'a family birthday', 'a trip to the train station', 'shopping in a department store' and 'eating in a restaurant' that are normally the situations one would find oneself in whether in a foreign country or not, are included complete with vocabulary in one concentrated and easy to find area.  Rules of grammar are boxed off as are conjugations--sometimes the author shortcuts the conjugations by just showing the endings--I would have found it more helpful to actually see the actual completed conjugation.<br /><br />I agree that this book is an overview.  It can by no means supply the user with every idiomatic phrase used by the modern French speaker.  Heavens, entire tomes are written on this subject alone and in all sorts of formats!  But, I do think that using this book as a private workbook or in conjunction with a good teacher would more than satisfy even the most cynical language book reviewer.  Just last night I scanned the book and penciled in the answers to a number of the exercises merely to make sure I understood grammatical concepts that I learned years ago---the dogged nature of the book's format did help me to remember and the correct answers are included in the review at the end of each five chapter grouping.<br /><br />I would categorize this book as a good functional refresher to those who have studied French before, want a concise overview or use it in a classroom situation with a good teacher.  There is no pronunciation guide (no individual phonetic spelling of each vocabulary word or phrase) and no accompanying CD to help you get at least a semblance of a French accent.  In addition to this book, I would recommend the CLE series used by the Alliance Francaise--workbook and text as well or checking out your local college to see what beginning text book series is utilized there---the Glencoe texts used in highschool are very good, but are. of course, geared towards adolescents.

Tracey Sullivan joins the ranks of millions of other romance heroines in this novel by Judith Gould as she quickly fades out of your memory once you turn the last page of the book.  Gould does her best to create a character that is feisty and hard-working while possessing a value system that acceptably gets high grades on most people's morality meter.  However, Gould seems obsessed with presenting a  \\"modern heroine\\" that will appeal to readers that, I suppose, keep scorecards on just how small one's mini-skirt is, how high one's high heels are, how much make-up one applies before being seen by a man, and how many cheap knock-off designer clothing one can palm off as the real deal.  Instead of all the fascination with such superficial trappings, Gould should concentrate more on her character development.  In the case of Trace, all the spectacular settings, gorgeous clothing and melodramatic events in the world, could not save this character from the boring formulaic image destined for the graveyard of obscurity.<br /><br />The plot, revolving around Trace's father's supposed suicide and two mysteries, one from the past and one on-going that arise because of it, packs a lot of action for a 340+ page novel.  In fact, some of the sideline stories would have been intriguing with a little more development and a lot less mundane detail.  In particular, I liked the two fraud investigators, Montague Pleasance and Stanlee Sadwith--in fact, Gould seems to have a flare for presenting the hard-boiled in an appealing light that makes for quick interesting turn-paging reading. This seems to be her real forte. But, unfortunately Montague and Stanlee, are just not in the story enough to make much of an impact on the overall analysis.  The other Miami based characters, Mirabel and Ramon are superfluous to the main story line; actually they act as an excuse for Gould to add some hot sexual encounters which after a while get as old and conventional as all the other sex scenes written for this genre.<br /><br />For me, the main draw of the novel was the exotic setting on Santorini, in the Greek Isles.  But, Gould does nothing with this whatsoever; her descriptions could have been copied out of one of the many guidebooks on the subject.  The Greeks of the island are described sadly as either crones or nobodies.  The personality of such a virile race is give poor treatment by Gould here.  I did not feel transported from my lawn chair to either Miami or Greece.  More could have been afforded the character of Urania, the primetime TV soap opera queen and the mystery surrounding the distraught occupant of her turret room---the information overload that serves as a denouement at the tale end of the novel could have been made a lot more palatable--I just didn't think the flashback technique worked very well there.<br /><br />Bottom line:  if you like escapist novels with lots of sex, descriptions of clothing and make-up application and are not big on dialogue but strong on action, give \\"The Greek Villa\\" a shot.  If not and you love books set in Greece, rediscover Mary Stewart's classics written in the late 50s, early 60s for a real treat.or this genre.  <BR><BR>For me, the main draw of the novel was the exotic setting on Santorini, in the Greek Isles.

The book immediately plunges into some of the more difficult concepts which normally would perplex the English speaking student with great ease.  Each page consists of sidebar type boxes where verbs are conjugated, vocabulary lists abound, and grammar rules are succinctly laid out.  Each chapter begins with new vocabulary revolving around a specific event like &quot;Buying a Ticket in a Train Station&quot; or &quot;A Family Birthday&quot;.  Dialogues using the vocabulary words in typical uncomplicated sentences accompany each topic and a variety of exercises follow along with detailed grammer explanations.  All exercise answers are provided in the back of the book.<br /><br />Unlike some of the more colorful workbook type language guides, this book omits the cutsy pictures and cartoons and concentrates on what's really important:  getting the rules of the language down by engaging in the variety of exercises included.  If there is one thing that would add to the value of this text, it would be the inclusion of an audio CD with recitations of the dialogue and some practice exericises to train the ear and the tongue to the cadences of the Italian language.<br /><br />Bear in mind, that I am using this book in conjunction with having an instructor who, of course, corrects pronunciation and comes up with imaginative composition assignments to augment a course outline that closely follows the format of the book. As with any new language, an instructor to correct misconceptions and misunderstanding, I feel, is paramount to ultimate understanding and prevents the student from creating a language that only he or she understands.	2003-10-10

When she meets Dr. Bennett O'Reilly, a chaos theorist, Sandy thinks she has met the one person immune to the herd instinct who may finally provide the insight needed to crack the fad conundrum.  As they embark upon a chance project combining both their strengths observing the habits of a flock of not-so-terribly-bright sheep, Sandy discovers that she is following a fad far older than any of the fads she has previously analysed and hits upon an answer that ties all of the story's strengths and sidebars into a clever satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Bellwether is the first Connie Willis novel I have read; I found her style straight humorous and thoroughly engaging.  All the characters entertain;  even the most stereotypical---Flip, Management, the &quot;time-out&quot; moms and the aghast waiters from Boulder's trendiest coffee shops and restaraunts manage to convey the lemming effect quite realistically and yet imaginatively.  Willis' depiction of HiTek's paperwork debacle, use of synergistic phrases as motivation tools and the overkill touchy-feely employee relations meetings typifies real life in big corporation in a way that more frightening than Hallowe'en.<br /><br />If you are looking for a short novel that satirizes the media effect on modern life, amuses, yet doesn't get too perplexing, &quot;Bellwether&quot; is just such a read.  Based on this reading experience and the positive comments provided by the other reviewers, another Connie Willis novel will find its way into my shopping cart again soon. If you are in the mood for fun, do read it.	2003-10-10

The condition comes hand in hand with the usual drug side effect stipulations, no driving, no television and no deliberate revealing of the future.<br /><br />As interesting as all this sounds, and believe me there are segments in the book that fully captivate the reader's attention, the story of Henry and Clare, his wife, fails to generate any real magic--and I don't mean the flights of fancy conjured up in the legions of romance novels. I didn't feel the intensity of their love at all. In fact, the only real emotion the book successfully conveys is a sense of utter desperation; the characters continually struggle to construct the semblance of a normal existence, but sadly, a little knowledge proves to be a dangerous thing, and the feeling of predetermination hovers over the ambiance of the story like the Sword of Damacles.  I continually asked myself, why the young girl Clare was so fascinated by a 40 year old man appearing naked in the meadow by her home?  I still haven't a clue.  Henry is not constructed as a particularly model character, on the contrary he seems outright obnoxious at times.<br /><br />Instead of the sophisticated love story that some of the other reviewers raved over, I read an overly-long, distractedly-written narrative told in both Clare's and Henry's voices that points out in the most depressing way that life is way too short.  I don't read entertainment fiction, especially fiction recommended by the Today Show, to give me more to ponder over during a bout of insomnia. That's about as much fun as being beleagured by drug company messages regarding the threats of cholestorol, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, allergy attacks, stroke, etc while watching one hour of prime time televison.<br /><br />Hence, \\"The Time-Traveler's Wife\\" is recommended to anyone who has about five days to waste reading about a wasted life. My advise? Save your money and your time.  If you want to read tried and true and respect television book clubs, pick up one of Oprah's classic selections; they have all the depth of meaning and true conveyence of emotions that 'The Time Traveler's Wife' fails to deliver. Or if this time travel scenario still piques your interest, wait for the movie so enthusiastically awaited by some of the other reviewers.  In the right hands and with the right script, two charismatic actors can add the poignancy ingredient the author left out.

Folks whom have already gotten passed the hype of American consumerism and have realized that all those gorgeous models popping fast food, donuts, sugared soft drinks and candy in their mouths are being paid by these products' manufacturers to simply get you to open your wallets, will definitely profit from Phil's no nonsense approach.<br /><br />The good Dr. does not give you a diet secret combination a la the Zone, the 30-40-30 plan, or D'Adamo's blood type, to help you understand you body's reaction to food, so if you have already made the decision to be realistic about the daily onslaught of the media advocating the American push towards excess-- somewhere in our minds we all know that the all-you-can-eat buffets, super-sized meals, and man-sized portions result in getting more for your money but also means logically being physically larger in general---then you need to come up with a plan of attack, push aside all the images you see on television and figure out exactly how much food your body needs to maintain good health and how portion-wise you are going to adminster that nourishment.  I don't think Dr, Phil provides a detailed plan, even though he does include sample menu ideas in the book; he takes the same common-sense country boy approach to dieting as he does when delivering his one-two punch tag lines on his television show.  So if you like Dr. Phil and his down-home philosophy, I believe this book can help you.  If you need something with more structure that will teach you what a portion is, use Phil's advice as a springboard and find a dieting group or on-line club that will offer support as you delve into the diet you choose.<br /><br />If you are sick to death of counting calories, you still need to define portion; you still need to be able to realize when your body is no longer hungry and you need to stop eating.  I have found that looking into the French way of eating has helped me to do this.  Check out the Fat Fallacy by Will Clower or hook into the Fat Fallacy discussion on Yahoo Groups.  Read Anne Barone's Chic and Slim books which relate 50-something Barone's own struggle with being overweight and how she won the battle by observing the eating habits of French women.  Sometimes the simplest advice is the best----for me--thanks to Anne--- wearing a pair of slacks or a skirt with a waistband and a zipper instead of an elasticized waistline helps me to stop eating--that pressure in the waistline gets you everytime.<br /><br />Getting your mind off the food and onto something else is also key.  If all day long you are watching television and are bombarded with diet success testimonials, miracle drugs and other reminders of your lack of a life---turn off the TV and go out and live your life.  The weight comes off as you get your mind on other things.<br /><br />Bottom line: ...on; you still need to be able to realize when your body is no longer hungry and you need to stop eating.

US	53093124	R1DNGWDVUMOKTJ	0060522259	132584057	Elegance: A Novel	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	Fun Brigit Jones Clone	Thirty-two year old Yankee Louise is surrounded by chic London socialites, while she miserably stands vigil by her husband's side at a boring gallery opening where she is mistaken in her out-of-date and ill-fitting frock as pregnant.  Such disgrace begins Louise's journey to fashion and confidence nirvana with a used book by a French fashion expert as her knowing guide.  As Louise whips through the encyclopedic style manual,---we are treated to excerpts in all 26 chapter headings---she sheds not only her excess weight, but her scared-to-come-out-of-the-closet husband.  The revelation that 'elegance' merely means looking appropriate for the occasion, for one's companion and for oneself, comes slowly---Louise actually arrives at date with a man at the Ritz in a tarty outfit and panicking must swap clothes with a more classically refined friend --- Tessaro has fun making the most of describing Louise's faux pas along the way to discovering a style of her own.  The ending, of course, borders on the predictable---with the dawning of personal taste and an involvement in one's own life, comes the reward, in this case a rather dishy musician who is 8 years younger than Louise. Lucky Louise.<br /><br />&quot;Elegance&quot; offers yet another glance at the Cinderella story that has been done over and over again, time out of mind.  If you've just read Brigit Jones and are a bit tired of deciphering the British slang and celebrity references, I would pass on this one until at least it comes out in paperback or you are in the mood for more of the same. The novel is meant to be fun, there are no grand revelations or great secrets here, just common sense----although some readers are obviously taking it quite seriously as I have read that copies of the quoted Dariaux book are currently big business on E*bay. I will recommend it for those who, like myself, like a fun read about fashion and becomng a swan instead of an ugly duckling---what could be more appealing?  I will also recommend it as a springboard to those who enjoy exploring a more classic quieter way of life even though this is just touched upon in the novel. You laughed a bit and found Louise's antics amusing, now, check out  &quot;Joie De Vivre&quot; by restauranteur Arbor--a charming look at French life---and Will Clower's &quot;The Fat Fallacy&quot; which explains the French manner of eating to stay slim.  &quot;Elegance&quot;, the novel will intrigue you by Tessaro's modern interpretaion of Madame Dariaux's &quot;Elegance&quot; where dressing well and looking well are equally as important as eating and savoring your life and push you through to your own thresold to find such a life of your own.it as a springboard to those who enjoy exploring a more classic quieter way of life even though this is just touched upon in the novel.

Of course, the sexual chemistry sizzles with incendiary powers that would make the most seasoned arsonist flinch.  If that isn't bad enough, the secondary characters are so cutsy with their neverending chorus of \\"Oh, how beautiful you are\\" and \\"He has the hottest butt\\" type dialogue, they literally had me rolling my eyes up into my head wondering why I ever purchased this book in the first place.<br /><br />I really wanted to read a ghost story, thinking maybe a poor man's \\"The Uninvited\\", \\"Julian's House\\" or maybe even something along the line of one of Erksine's classics, \\"Midnight is a Lonely Place. Instead I got to read a formula romance that uses a Northern Virginian setting, complete with a hokey Civil War enactment and drippingly charismatic Southern gentlemen extolling the charms of their big-busted, narrow-waisted womenfolk.  Tell me, does someone out there really enjoy this type of a read?  Must be, as Heather Graham---gasp--- is apparently a New York Times bestselling author.  Sadly, even the ghost story gets lost in all the confusion that the main characters feel towards each other--poor Matt doesn't believe in ghosts, long-limbed, red-headed Darcy feels that she is a weirdo who talks to ghosts---will there love survive all this doubt?  Quite honestly, I didn't care.<br /><br />The only heartfelt moments in the story revolve around the character of Josh--introduced in the preface as Darcy's lead-in to the spirit world.  Graham certainly has the opportunity to involve this character in some interesting scenes--but, for some reason, she does not--being too involved in making the formula work and giving all those \\"ah shucks\\" southerners all those \\"golly gee whiz\\" lines must have taken up all her time.<br /><br />Recommended to readers who absolutely love formula romance where you can guess the outcome from the second page.enes--but, for some reason, she does not--being too involved in making the formula work and giving all those \\"ah shucks\\" southerners all those \\"golly gee whiz\\" lines must have taken up all her time.<BR><BR>Recommended to readers who absolutely love formula romance where you can guess the outcome from the second page.	2003-09-25
US	53093124	R3T7F1RL0ZP1CJ	0767900383	632913221	Under the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy	Books	3	5	7	N	Y	A Quest for Contentment	Reading Frances Mayes tribute to Tuscany is akin to sitting in a hammock on a bright sunny day listening to a bumblebee droning amongst the flowers in a nearby garden:  the luscious descriptions make me thirst for some equivalent in my own life, while the lack of overall plot drowses me to a gentle lull of sleep.  This latter result, by no means represents an insult to Mayes' writing style; on the contrary I commend her abilities to create an atmosphere so dense with detail that this old insomniac had no other choice but to close her eyes being nearly blinded by the bright gold of the sunflower fields and deafened by the bombardment of so many adjectives and adverbs used in chains of prepositional phrases that rival the links in a DNA helix.<br /><br />In my opinion, Mayes, like Martha Stewart, capitalizes on her found good things.  As she put together a scrap book/journal of the time spent renovating her home and her life in Cortona, her publisher, some other artsy friend or &quot;right connection&quot; wondered at the  marketability of the saga of yet another American looking for La Dolce Vita in a foreign land. The 'Under the Tuscan Sun' corporation was hence born and is now growing rather steadily and quite nicely, morphing from one book into three, a movie and now associated merchandise. Alas, America has now recreated Tuscany at Walmart prices.<br /><br />For the most part &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun's&quot; popularity rides solely on its ability to recreate the Italian ambiance.  But you don't need Mayes for that, anyone who has visited Italy understands the sense of well-being and almost childlike happiness that bursts out of you like some mystical revelation when you first see the rolling hills, the citadel villages and experience the warmth of the people. American writers have been pondering over this treasure trove of simple living for well over a century.<br /><br />Although Mayes describes her conversion from one way of life to another with the effervescence of a newly uncorked bottle of spumante, she still lives part time in the United States.  Perhaps the yearning note in her poetry and prose suggests that the glass is somehow still half empty rather than half full---an idea alien to the Italian spirit which Mayes strives so competently and technically to replicate.  The desire to analyze a way of life that defies description---and actually has no need for such rigorous retelling is almost criminal.  Such an existence simply is and will continue to thrive without, indeed in spite of, the spotlight of Mayes' making.<br /><br />So instead of buying into this American globilization of Tuscany, book that trip to Italy and make a scrapbook of your own.  If you already purchased Mayes' book, take it along:  it has some really good wine suggestions and explains the concept of seasonal eating.  I have not tried any of Mayes recipes, but I am sure they are good, if you can find the ingredients in the US. Recommended to those who want to get a sense of life in a foreign land, shed their Americanism and travel back to the old country where life is simpler. If you are buying the book because you have seen the movie, forget it---the movie's plot revolves around a theme of renewal after emotional disaster rather than the search for a simpler life.a newly uncorked bottle of spumante, she still lives part time in the United States.

Laura, our heroine, writes mysteries; she is cute, pert, intelligent and a bit impetuous. Her dry spell sends her to her sister's beach house where atmosphere and town history quickly spur the creative juices.  Michael, the love interest, reeks of masculinity as proclaimed from an attitude originating from the chisled face starng down from a well-muscled 6 foot 2 inch frame.  The suspects oscillate from innocence to guilt as Laura overhears key snatches of conversation involving the inhabitants of an inn in a small Nova Scotian seafaring town where the tendency to smuggle contraband has been passed on from generation to generation.<br /><br />\\"Undertow\\" certainly does not have the structural complexity of \\"Splendor Falls\\" or \\"Name of the Dragon\\", but the Kearsley magic can still be uncovered:  her dialogue flows easily despite the cutsy adjectives and adverbs describing the underlying magnetism between the two leads.  Her knack for developing sexual attraction is in full force.  For those devourers of romantic suspense, \\"Undertow\\" may seem juvenile; its outcome easily predicted.  For those Susanna Kearsley fans, \\"Undertow\\" is a must-have in collection that may one day rival Mary Stewart.  Rated 4 stars, not for its value as a story but for its significance in the development of a great romantic suspense writer.	2003-09-23

Lucy Waring, a twenty-something actress steps off the London stage and onto the idyllic Ionian island of Corfu.  In a the course of a morning swim, paradise transforms to a place of sinister doings: someone shoots at a tamed dolphin, a young Greek drowns off the coast of Albania, and a smuggler washes up dead in a nearby cove.  Stewart uses all her formidable skill, crafting a strong story that is both literary and fast moving.  Told from Lucy's point-of-view, the reader's is kept as taut as a wire as the tension mounts not only while Lucy attempts to determine the identity of the wrongdoer and the reason for his misdemeanors but as she inadvertently puts herself in harm's way.<br /><br />Playfully, Stewart pulls out all the stops, introducing one of her most cleverly contrived secondary characters, Sir Julian Gale, a Lawrence Olivier facsimile whose theory that the island setting of Shakespeare's &quot;Tempest&quot; and Corfu are one and the same adds much charm and ambiance to an already gloriously depicted exotic locale.  Cleverer still, she employs the idea of the deus ex machina in a most enjoyable sequence, where the 'god' is a young Greek male and the 'machine', his improbable motorcycle.<br /><br />As always, the Stewart heroine impeccably relates each event as it occurs with an astonishing literacy--the language employed borders on poetry; the reader actually smells every flower, is blinded by the lush colors of the foilage and stung by the salt of the Ionian Sea.  In kind, Stewart characterizes her Greeks with an affectionate curiosity and love of the stranger; their traditions and rituals are reported with much respect and admiration.<br /><br />As noted in some of my other reviews of Stewart's work, this author's masterly use of plot, character, language and style puts her in a genre all her own.  She is quite definitely incomparable.  'This Rough Magic&quot; is one of my favorite Stewart selections: one of a trio of novels set in Greece and the Greek Isles that uses the strained politics of the late 50s and early 60s as a backdrop to catapult a rather normal UK female protagonist into an abnormal situation where the British sense of responsibility is shown to positive advantage.<br /><br />Recommended with the wish that all the Stewart suspense tales are reissued in trade paperback with Reader's Questions.ugh Magic&quot; is one of my favorite Stewart selections: one of a trio of novels set in Greece and the Greek Isles that uses the strained politics of the late 50s and early 60s as a backdrop to catapult a rather normal UK female protagonist into an abnormal situation where the British sense of responsibility is shown to positive advantage.<BR>  <BR>Recommended with the wish that all the Stewart suspense tales are reissued in trade paperback with Reader's Questions.	2003-09-16
US	53093124	R3A9ZHKQ28CEN	1570719276	875642269	Living La Dolce Vita: Bring the Passion, Laughter and Serenity of Italy into Your Daily Life	Books	5	56	59	N	Y	The Sweetest Life	Your impression of this book may be to think that it is merely an Italian flavor in the current bouquet garni of Francophile literature---Arbor's 'Joie de Vivre', Barone's 'Chic and Slim' and Olivier's 'Entre Nous--- touting a lifestyle that seeks the laissez-faire routine of the Old World rather than the stressful chaos of the New.  It is all that and more---think of grafting &quot;How to Think Like Leonardo Di Vinci&quot; with the sentiment found in &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; or &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; and then imagine savoring a delicious fresh pasta and sauce delicately enhanced with white truffle complimented by a superb wine.  You feel better already---you've taken a deep breath and actually relaxed and smelled the cappucino.<br /><br />Rather than a wistful memoir of the quintessential Provencial village or a how-to book on keeping slim by eating the French way, Dr. Mautner looks at the whole being, not just one aspect.  She begins her (and your) quest for the perfect, seemingly elusive lifestyle by exploring herself in relation to community rather than in the rugged individualism of Americanism.  For Mautner, the core or hearth is her Italian American family where warmth and love promotes outward growth, yet blazes like a lodestar to maintain a secure sense of attachment and belonging.  Like a superbly spiced puttanesca sauce, Mautner liberally seasons what she undoubtably knows (a very Italian trait) with anecdotes demonstrating the values learned from family:  her grandmother's unflailing loyalty, her grandfather's amiability, etc..  She explains the Italian concept of the &quot;bella figura&quot;, a phrase I remember my mother using to simply mean 'putting your best foot forward'--looking your best, treating yourself well, putting aside the &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; mentality for one of &quot;this feels good and makes me feel better, so why not indulge on a daily basis?  With interesting sidebars, Mautner encapsulizes just what it is about Italians that make them seem so earthy, easy-going and yet, oh-so-worldly. Diet and exercise are touched upon---a scant amount of recipes are included, but this is not the primary emphasis of the text.  Mautner analyses the self and the way it integrates with family, with friends and with lovers.  Above all, the book and its step-by-step advice emulates both a stimulating walk along Florence's busy streets and a leisurely bike ride in the Unbrian hills: it prods yet quiets.<br /><br />Once you read the book through, you will want to keep a copy on your nighttable or desk to refer to often--to refresh your memory and recapture the feeling you want to maintain. La Dolce Vita is all mapped out--you need only shrug off your inhibitions and follow Mautner's guidelines.  If you are lucky enough to already be an Italian American, as I am, you will savor the memories and bask with pride at your heritage.

Here in &quot;The Sand-Reckoner&quot;, she brings the complicated mind of the Archi-Mechanic, Archimedes, to life in a simple well-written literary manner that can be compared to Ron Howard's equally marvelous glimpse inside the mind of Nobel Prize Winning Game Theorist John Nash in the film, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.  Bradshaw allows the reader to understand Archimedes' distractions, his love of mathematics, his enjoyment of and utter concentration employed in solving a puzzle and his disgust at the practical and barbaric uses of his mind exercises.  Better yet, her auxillary cast of characters illustrates through their exasperation and confusion the impact such a different mind has on those it touches. Bradshaw crafts a simple story revolving around Archimede's desire to return to the learned city of Alexandria and his feelings of nationalism towards his home city of Syracuse, now besieged by the Romans during the first Punic War.  The interplay of characters and their motives is superb.  Marcus, his Roman slave, torn between his love of his adopted 'family' and his ties to his country, contends with Archimedes' lack of practicality-- a lack his mother and sister have grown to understand but find frustrating.  King Hierion, tyrant of Syracuse, wishes only to harness Archimedes' great skill in building seige machines and uses Archimedes' patriotism to chain him to the city.  Delia, the king's sister and master musician is intrigued by the young genius and finds through him a way to live the life of which she has been dreaming.  Great emotions tug at the reader's heart as the story unfolds; each of the characters embodies only the best of ideals.  The reader comes away with a sense of touching the great mind of Archimedes himself but also basks in the light of the selflessness of the Marcus character, whose bravery I found myself thinking about days after finishing the novel.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who love an uncomplicated historical novel with a straightfoward story and unforgettable characters.<BR><BR>Recommended to all those who love an uncomplicated historical novel with a straightfoward story and unforgettable characters.	2003-09-05

Is she crazy or merely sensationally romantic?<br /><br />If I were to analyze la bella dona, Marlena, by her writing alone, I would submit that indeed she is a romantic---each of the moments she describes on the island of Lido and Venice proper, wax with almost too much poetry.  In spite of this tendency for long windedness, Marlena infuses her little book with such infectious optimism for the future that the reader automatically forgives her indulgences.<br /><br />After all, it is she, not us, taking the big chance, exchanging her old life for something completely foreign.  And she does this, not as a young ingenue in her 20s or early 30s but as a  mature woman with grown children. Each of her decisions and contemplations is most intricately explored; questions that arise in any mature mind are handled with an infinite and loving look at a future that isn't as long as it seemed when one was much younger. Brava, Marlena, for giving the spark of love a chance to grow into a flame and to express your anxieties with such honesty.<br />The first part of Marlena's story ignites that flame within the reader's heart; the details of the mystery Venetian steadfastly wooing the woman of his dreams based on just a glimpse of her profile emulates the great romances.  The author's technique of flashing back to her first visit to Venice does not make its thematic point as quickly as one would wish, and so seems to muddy the pace of the actual tale of courtship and marriage. However, this, too does not mar the overall tapestry that De Blasi ultimately crafts.<br /><br />In the second half of the book. De Blasi deals with her assimilation into the Italian mindset--a transition she makes totally possible through her use of interior design and her love of good food--wonderful recipes of some of the key meals mentioned in the text are thoughtfully provided at the end of the book.  The couples' decision to chuck their newly converted Lido apartment for a life of helping others create their own dream environment in Tuscany and Umbria seems perfectly in tune with the book's emphasis on shunning the routine and keeping life a continuum of surprise.  I hope that Marlena will follow this book up with a tale of her new adventures as the couple molts into their new lifestyle.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who love romance and the thought of living in a foreign land.some of the key meals mentioned in the text are thoughtfully provided at the end of the book.

US	53093124	RQLO1P4J2Z1T9	0452284481	153627	Le Divorce	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Isabel's Rather Rude Awakening	While I admired the literary quality of the writing and laughed over the cultural comparisons between Californian Americans and Parisian French, I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed the story or the rather jaded outcome of Isabel Walker's misadventures in the City of Lights.  Johnson's Isabel, is just too, too much the perfect rendering of the laid back Californian American as defined by a media that advocates the superficial and pseudo-cerebral instead of the development of inner consciousness.  Isabel, indicative of today's American generation that yearns for nothing material, is, indeed, decidely confused, but is she representative of an entire American generation, America itself, or just a cyber-rendition of what the media tells us Americans are?  Does she rush off to Paris to anchor herself to Old World realities after drifting in a sea of Disneyesque optimism?  Although she thinks she is going to rescue her step-sister Roxy from the throes of an unexpected divorce, Isabel sadly realizes that her family is actually more anxious about her than her sister.  With little focus to drive her, Isabel is fair game to the more worldy French characters in the novel--all of which do have agendas and a corresponding matter-of-factness that clearly works to delineate them from their more innocent American counterparts. Here the reader comes face to face with the full force of the elder sibling attitude the novel attributes to the French characters as they look disdainfully on their culturally naive friends from across the pond. From this perspective, it seems fitting that older statesman, Edgar--perhaps emblematic of the older French culture-- takes Isabel under his wing and his sheets to illustrate rather than dictate the facts of life.  More so, it seems natural for him to end their affair before it began to fizzle and more natural still for Isabel to dally with the French minister afterwards as her sensibilities slowly assimilate to form an American/French hybrid. But what's the overall message?  American optimism is simply childish when compared with an older, more world-weary culture?<br />As a farce, the over-the-top situations that arise as the plot unfurls are as funny as they are improbable.  But this does not detract from the story it merely allows the national character differences to shine through even more strongly.  Whether or not you approve of Isabel's behavior or like the portrayals of the French or the Americans simply does not matter.  Johnson's novel works well as a modern recreation of the old innocents abroad/coming-of-age theme with a political twist.  Recommended as both a cautionary tale and a black comedy.t what's the overall message?

In a town but a few hours away,renegade police officer, Lt. Karim Abdouf looks into a bizarre desecration of a child's tomb.  Grange expertly plaits the information gleaned by the simultaneous investigations and creates an engaging panorama nearly as spectacular as the Alps that look down on this seemingly innocuous example of college life.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't believe the English translation does this book justice, especially when read by an American audience, as the slang seems to be geared towards a UK market.  Nevertheless, this detracts only slightly to Grange's intriguing storyline where he pulls out all the stops, throwing in almost every au courant red herring except for the proverbial butler and kitchen sink.<br /><br />Recommended to all those who enjoy a good psychological thriller set in a different terrain where the players make use of the exceptional environment and play by a different set of rules.	2003-08-11

The narrative, although an interesting recount of actress Carol Drinkwater's purchase of and initial rennovations on a run-down olive farm in the South of France, lacks the sparkling energy of Peter Mayle's 'A Year in Provence'.  Instead, Drinkwater's tale mingles oh-so-sweet recollections that tiresomely wax on the poetic with bald reenactments of her lowest emotional moments--moments that transform her dream of a working farm producing rich and succulent olive oil into nothing more than a meaningless childish fantasy.  The result never quite gels to produce an even story---instead the reader wants to either fast-forward through the author's awkward poetry to get to an action sequence, or fast forward through the melancholy action to reach an enjoyable idyll in the Midi sun.  Unfortunately, the idylls in the sun are few and far between--Drinkwater only sparks with life when she writes about the numerous dogs that stray onto her newly-acquired property.<br /><br />One gets the sense, that this book started out as a series of essays rather than a fully planned out book--the ending was rushed and I would have thought that as the book began with the idea of working towards and owning the farm, an appropriate ending would have been the actual purchase of the property outright after all the trials and tribulations both Drinkwater and her husband labored through.  Instead, a murky resolution of the author's feelings about her father's death and the troubles regarding a television production seem to overshadow the book's original theme and premise.<br /><br />Recommended only to those who cannot read enough about the south of France, especially those who enjoy the 'Under the Tuscan Sun' genre of travel literature.	2003-08-11

M. Arbor obviously cherishes the existence he writes about so lovingly.<br />Arbor lingers over descriptions of what he terms a typical French day. The reader senses his exuberance shining through the pages as they read about his breakfast, his time at a friend's garden, his love of fresh vegetables newly picked, shopping in the tiny family run French specialty stores that provide only the best food--all preservative free. As he sings the praises of the perfect roast chicken--stuffed with a piece of simple French bread and crowned with Provence herbs and root vegetables--I have tried this recipe and it is very good, your mouth will literally water. He urges the reader to delight in the little moments of life as defined by family and friends, good food and great wine. His glee is as ambiant as the light filterng through his morning window and as palpable as savoring the home-made pain du Chocolat he describes for an extra special afternoon snack. What he describes is indeed idyllic--a veritable fairytale land where all the senses are sated. Real? Who cares? It sounds wonderful to me. I felt as if I had spent a week with Arbor in his tranquil French village.<br /><br />In fact, just reading about it all allowed me to plunge back in time to when I myself was a little girl and my mother sent my brother and I to a garden of a neighbor to pick zucchini blossoms. My mother would fry this in a simple batter---oh what a marvelous treat. If not for Arbor's reminisciences, I would have never remembered how wonderful the whole experience was or how much I attribute such things to the real meaning of \\"home\\".<br /><br />On a more realistic level, Arbor's lifestyle may be difficult to reproduce here in the United States where we rely more on cars and supermarkets to shop rather than applying the \\"faire les courses\\" mentality of the French way of marketing. Perhaps here in New Orleans, or in other large cities, this is easier to accomplish, but I would say those who live in a more suburban or rural existence where bakeries, patisseries, chacuteries, cremeries, etc. simply do not exist or have been replaced by large supermarket chains promoting convenience rather than quality, will have a more difficult time of advocating Arbor's lifestyle. Of course, anyone can find ways to shrug off the tension of American life at any given moment by simply stopping to smell the coffee and enjoying smaller pleasant moments of life instead of always expecting the biggest events that we are unrealistically conditioned to believe we deserve.<br /><br />Arbor's message is simple and at the same time lovely to read about: Say \\"no\\" to stress--Simply smile and enjoy--eat well, drink well and cherish those that make up our individual worlds. A wonderful glimpse into what could be possible for those who crave a more European lifestyle. Also recommended are Will Clower's Fat Fallacy and Anne Barone's Chic and Slim Series--these books are recommended for those who are interested in how the French manage to stay so slim after indulging in all that greatly satisfying food.n New Orleans, or in other large cities, this is easier to accomplish, but I would say those who live in a more suburban or rural existence where bakeries, patisseries, chacuteries, cremeries, etc. simply do not exist or have been replaced by large supermarket chains promoting convenience rather than quality, will have a more difficult time of advocating Arbor's lifestyle.

Bravo Mr. Iles for giving this part of the country a modern voice.<br />'Sleep No More' takes place in Natchez, MS where geologist John Waters, a semi-happily married man lives with his wife and daughter and battles the everyday anxieties and futilities of keeping his oil drilling business afloat.  He thinks his two biggest problems are an EPA investigation which may clean him out financially and his womanizing partner and lifelong friend, Cole who is up to his neck in gambling debts and is draining capital from the partnership to sustain his habits.  However, when Eve Sumners walks into his life, Waters misjudges the magnitude of his current problems; they seem small when compared to the mess of trouble she brings to his somewhat mellow existence.  Somehow, Eve knows all the intimate details of a hot and steamy relationship that began at Ole Miss and eventually went sour; Eve claims she is Water's lost love, a woman who was killed by a rapist ten years earlier. Sickened, yet intrigued, Waters cannot move far enough out of her orbit; eventually he is sucked in and helplessly consummed. But when Eve is found in their trysting place dead, Water's problems multiple like the tribles in the classic Star Trek episode.<br /><br />Iles builds his totally believable character of Waters expertly; the reader understands his torment, his fascination and his incredulity.  Here is a solid citizen asked to believe the unbelievable.<br /><br />The plot is a bit convoluted in places and Iles does ask you to suspend disbelief and play along with his premise.  I must admit there were times I asked myself why I actually was buying the whole thing.  Nevertheless, he does tie the whole package up neatly, loose strings and all, but whether or not this is as fundamentally enthralling as 'Mortal Fear' is questionable and a matter of taste.  The activity and interplay between the set of characters is so complicated and perverse that overall the read just isnt as satisfying as some of Iles' earlier works.  Be that as it may, it still held my attention, is certainly a fast read and recommended even if it is just to experience the modern day Gulf Coast from a writer that really knows and loves his territory.vity and interplay between the set of characters is so complicated and perverse that overall the read just isnt as satisfying as some of Iles' earlier works.

In this second book of the Christ Clone Trilogy, author BeauSeigneur chillingly fleshes out the cataclysmic events foretold in Revelations in an easy to read novel format.  From the first installement, the reader followed the early life of Christopher Goodman, a genetically engineered human being whose DNA was removed from the Shroud of Turin.  Now Christopher has achieved a certain amount of power and respect as a powerful delegate of a newer and stronger United Nations and with the help of powerful New Age allies has positioned himself to become the ultimate world leader.  Birth of an Age depicts Christopher's ascent to sovereignty as the rest of the world sits back horrified as the predictions of the apostle John and Saul Cohen in Israel come to pass with blood curdling accuracy.  BeauSeigneur scientifically and realistically portrays the discovery of three asteroids due to collide with the earth, the plague of locusts and the horror of a sickness that pits man against his loved ones.  The cataclysmic events move the novel along at such a pace that I was shocked and dismayed to discover that I was turning the last page---and did not have the final novel of the trilogy on hand!  All the fast moving brutality takes you at break neck speed to a climatic event that allows Christopher to reveal who he actually is within the scheme of the three books; I look forward to reading the concluding work; I am interested in discovering how BeauSeigneur will dispute Christopher's theory of God and depict the Second Coming.  The author's style of writing, as other reviewers have commented, is not exactly literary, rather it is designed to move the plot along in an easy to read almost television-magazine format that works.  Beauseigneur is not preachy, he tells his tale in a compelling fashion with appropriate citations from the Bible.  An all and all great follow-up to the first novel.	2003-07-07

They eat dinners with multiple courses that last well over three hours long and enjoy this marathon of eating well past the prescribed 8:00 curfew time that most American dieticians claim is time to stop the day's eating.  The question Clower poses is then:  Why are the French relatively thin and healthy while we Americans, with all our rules and diet limitations the most unhealthy and overweight people in the world?<br /><br />In a systematic format, Clower moves from topic to topic, citing the American fixation for medical studies and recommendations from such august bodies as the American Medical Association and the FDA and then ripping their premises to shreds by showcasing the typical French woman eating cheese--a definite high cholesterol no-no and bread with every meal---and still fitting into her tight black skirt, never concerned in the least about artery blockages or counting carb blocks.<br /><br />Clower does a fine job of debunking most of the newer fads that have replaced simple sensible eating in the American diet.  He explains that most of the studies that indicate positive results for ingesting particular preservatives and other food fillers are ironically funded by the manufacturers of the said product.  He also delves into the American psyche and need for &quot;the magic bullet&quot; that will make weight loss and good health a snap like so many other American advancements.<br /><br />If you want to get yourself off the dieting merry-go-round, Clower's book is a good start.  He also has a nice website. a monthly newsletter and a Yahoo Group for those who want to make the Fat Fallacy a way of life.	2003-07-07

Seqenenra and his family lives in relative peace far from the influence of the usuper's court, yet he seethes within from the indignity of being a true Prince of Egypt that will neve be king.  Add to this the Hyksos king, Apepa's fear that Seqenenra symbolizes a threat to his sovereignty and his constant baiting of Seqenenra to commit an act he can define as treasonous.  Apepa throws down the final gauntlet when he demands that Seqenenra silence the hippopotami that inhabit Seqenenra's marshland simply because the beasts are disturbing his sleep. What follows is the recounting of a last ditch effort by Seqenenra to reclaim what he feels is rightfully his in the only way he knows how: war.  The repercussions of his plans echo throughout his household and Gedge does a fine job of allowing each of the main characters an airing of their point of view as each acts out of his own sense of duty and honor to family and country.  Gedge punctuates a simple story with much detail about the daily lives of the ancient Egyptians--the reader can feel the heat, rejoice in the flooding of the Nile, almost smell the scent cones worn on the head and commiserate with the affront to the dignity of these proud people of the bloodline of great kings considered gods.  Recommended to all who love Gedges's other works of historical fiction and all those who are fascinated by Egypt and its kings.	2003-06-28

Each of the pages is liberally sprinkled with colorful drawings, a explanation or label in French and the phonetic pronunciation of whatever the picture depicts. Tres facile! The book is setup in 5 units: En Voyage (your arrival, transportation, hotel arrangements, sightseeing and departure), Eating out in Cafes and Restaurants (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner), Shopping (Clothes, Food and Household goods), the Basics ( Counting, Money, Communication, Services, Time, Restrooms and Emergencies) and the Index with a wonderful alphabet pronunciation that most books simply and foolishly do not include. Insightfully, Butler provides pages in the book for you to list such memorable things as your favorite restaurants and cafes, notable villages, favorite meals, etc.  She thoughtfully provides a page which depicts the types of French bread, the characteristics of the Fish you may choose on a menu--for example: les anchois are grey,oily,strong in flavor and fillets, country and region codes associated with the French telephone system, and many other interesting and necessary bits of information that you just will not find in the more popular guides.  Above all the format is fun and easy to use, Butler was wise enough to include a built in ribbon bookmark.

This tale of a moody sculptor living the high life in Paris and at his retreat in the Hill Country of Texas leaves much to be desired---most of all I needed to like the characters a lot better than I did.  I understood that Ross, the artist had sold out and was producing nudes that needed perhaps some degree of expertize to churn out but little imagination or even emotional output from the artist.  When Leda, the beautiful/ugly enigma walks into his life chaperoned by her more than mysterious sister, Celeste, I understood immediately why Ross would want to devote everything to capturing Leda's yin/yang of beauty versus ugliness in a 3-dimensional portrayal.  But after many other seemingly disengaging affairs with willful, mysterious women, I had to wonder just why he would want to stick his neck into such a jumble of psychological innuendo.<br /><br />Lindsey moves the story along at a quick pace, but again he seems to skim the character's surface---the only intense semi-dimensional personage is Leda and she only appears for a portion of the book.  Celeste, albeit mysterious, seems a little too sad; Ross, jaded and too detached--so much so you continue to wonder why he does the things he does for these women.<br /><br />I would have liked to see the plot include Ross's rich male friend, but this unfortunately does not happen and the climactic scene occurs at the plot's halfway mark instead of at the near end when it should.  The supposed killer ending simply doesn't satisfy unless we view the whole adventure as a morality tale where anyone playing with fire ends up being burnt like he/she deserves.  Call me an optomist but I don't read to ultimately feel fatalistic.<br /><br />The scenario involving the two women weavng a web motivated by revenge and passion is an old one used many times before---this one has all the makings of something familiar yet still interesting, especially in terms of Ross' excitement over the sculpture he is creating, but then falls flat without the needed climatic twist.

Books	4	26	29	N	N	More Chic &amp; Slim Advice From Anne Barone	It does not matter to me if Anne Barone is not a doctor, dietician or scientist--her diet and life mentality works for her and seems to be working for thousands of French women.  There is no famous study backing up her opinions just the old common sense adage--if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck etc., than it must be a duck.  In the same way, if eating cheese, butter, eggs, and bread does not put weight on the French, then it can certainly do the same for you.  Anne Barone, in a fun breezy style, explains how to take the French lifestyle of shopping for just enough food, buying fresh and real products, eating slower over a longer period of time by taking smaller bites and using the continental manner of using a fork and knife, so that you too can be fitting into those wonderfull slim black skirts and form-revealing white blouses accented with a pretty scarf or antique pin.  Sounds to good to be true?  The key as with all things is moderation and good judgement.  Anne explains how to think about your eating habits in ways that will help you to maintain good health while eating sumptious meals.  In this, her second book, she actually gives portion sizes and sample recipes as well as additional information comparing American ways with those of the French regarding the six major lifestyle departments of culture, being a woman, personal style, cuisine, shopping and home decor, and love--ooh la la!<br /><br />I find myself referring to this book just before I go to bed and have had time to mull over the events of the ending day--I try to tally up what I did to enjoy my life better, if I ate slower, took smaller bites, decided against that extra bite of pie-- and I find that this time to myself helps me to encourage myself because I know I am on the correct road to health and well-being. How can I not be?  Eating real food--not boxed convenience meals?  Taking enough time to know when I am full and then stop just beforehand.  Yes, it can be done and Anne encourages you along the way with her stories, examples and anecdotes.  I recommend this book to all women who want to feel like women and look like those women who turn men's heads!

Of course, I knew the basis of the first story--- the swan transformation and of the girl who had the task of sewing the special shirts to bring her brothers back to human form.  I loved the first person narrative--more so the character of Sorcha, young and vulnerable than her daughter Liadan who is just a tad too perfect to be thought real.  And I loved the romance between the lead characters and their chosen ones -- Marillier weaves a wonderful spell that can move you to tears.<br /><br />However, of all the heroines, I love Fianne of 'Child of the Prophesy' the best.  The daughter of Liaden's sister and the son of the evil lady Oonagh, Fianne lives a lonely life of study as an adept in the sorcerer's arts. Her grandmother, Oonagh, threatens her beloved father's life if she does not comply and do the evil witch's dirty business of somehow ensuring the failure of Liaden's son, Johnny (the Child of the Prophesy) and his mission to take back into Irish control the sacred islands from the Britons.  Oonagh wishes to finally destroy Sevenwaters and in the confused Fianne she finds a vulnerable tool.  The reader is privy to much delightful spellcasting as Fianne hones her craft and travels from Kerry to the north of Ireland to Sevenwaters where she initiates a plan of such intrigue you cannot fail to be entertained and mesmerized.  All the loose ends of the other two books are brought together satisfactorily in this last installement.  As Fianne continues on her painful path of destruction, she learns about family, love and above all her own strength -- a quality she did not think she possessed.  At the novel's climax, Fianne discovers something so surprising, even though the reader may have guessed long before, that the reader marvels at Marillier's developing talent in creating a character so full of doubt and yet relentlessly full of potential.  For those romantics, throughout the tale, a gentle love story evolves between Fianne and her chosen--there are thankfully no pages-long sex scenes here, just a sweet realization as the trilogy ends like most fairytales---reason fading into the mist of imagination.  Mariellier has created a lovely nuanced character that will long be remembered.  Well done!yet relentlessly full of potential.

Like Will Clower's book entitled \\"The Fat Fallacy\\", Barone's book focuses on the French lifestyle and compares it to our lifestyle here in the United States.  Keep in mind that many of Anne's comments and observations stem from the considerably repressive Puritan ethic which states simply that 'if it tastes, looks or feels good, its got to be bad for you\\"--such philosophy represents the cornerstone of American thinking on many issues.  That combined with our ready-to-go, off-the-peg mentality combines to produce a lethal and contradictory combination in terms of many things especially diet. We feed ourselves preservatives and then worship unrealistically tooth-pick thin models. Sadly, the idea of good old fashioned nourishment that tasted good and was enjoyed amongst family and friends has been replaced snd refined by a culture that reveres 'getting more for your money', and would prefer to pop diet pills, eat chemically preserved boxed entrees and exercise until the cows come home rather than show a little self-restraint and simply stop eating before one gets full.  Barone, like Clower suggests that much of the problem has to do with bolting down food--whereas the French spend two hours over lunch, we shovel down our food within 10 minutes---taking the time to eat and allowing the brain to decide whether or not the stomach is full will certainly stop those added inches from ruining our waistlines.  Barone does this in a much breezier, fun style than Clower--she relates her own experience in a compelling heartfelt narrative that is easy to read and easier to understand.  In addition to her comments on food, she also delineates between the American and French lifestyles regarding their self-image, their clothes, their homes and their relationships with men.  Again remember that much of the die-hard American logic that Barone opposes in her book strictly stems from her Bible-Belt background.  Those of us that are not from the Bible belt and do not stictly adhere to what is considered good-old American, may already drink wine with our meals, drink water, never soda, eat real food rather than packaged fast food snd have a good sense of self that is not decided by au courant trends seen on television or in magazines.  However, if you were brought up to believe that 'gain is never without pain' or 'if God wanted it to be that way, He would have made it that way', you definitely need to read this book. For all others, if you wish to have your own ideology summed up and reinforced by over 1000 years of French culture, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Anne Barone's tone is fun yet matter-of-fact.  I did not like the little magazine-type asides which she uses to tout her own work; I found these to be distractive rather than helpful.  She ends her discussion of all components of a French lifestyle with her 100 things-to-do list which neatly summarizes everything in the book.  Recommended to every woman who needs to find her inner self, rejoice in it and lose weight along the way to finding much pleasure.

All the stars awarded for this book are mostly due to the wonderful compendium of \\"asides\\" that the author sprinkles magazine-wise throughout the text in the form of French Girl Biographies (Audrey Tatou and Edith Piaf come to mind), French films which exemplify certain French lifestyle traits to the max, recipes, and a colorful melange of other varied topics which range from 'what a French girl has in her closet' to 'what she keeps in her refrigerator.'  Every one of these little sidebars are a delight to read and will fuel your own need to make the little things in life memorable and full of the joy of knowing that what you do is well done.<br />However the main text which categorizes such priceless accoutrements to a life well lived as French strikes me as unrealistic, albeit still fun. Many women of varied ethnicities can be attributed with that charismatic 'je ne sais quoi' that can be as heady and delicious as plunging your nose in a thousand fresh roses.  Ollivier directs most of her admonitions to her Anglo-Saxon compatriots--but to think that all American women are of Anglo Saxon descent or worse, to think that all American women are Anglo Saxon wannabees, sadly misrepresents the majority of women in the United States.  As an Italian American New Yorker, many of the tips and secrets Ollivier defines as solely 'French' are second nature to me--yet I am still an American.  Comparing the stereotype of a svelte French woman, cigarette dangling, beret, striped leotard, tight-black skirt-wearing to the stereotype of the All-American cheerleader who would kill for football tickets is fine for those of us who were all American cheerleaders and love sports--I, for one, was not and do not, and I find it amusing, and charming that most of the things dictated in this book are now not considered foreign or too different, but actually desirable and exotic!!!! I guess our pluralistic society does work in that it offers choices rather than conformity.<br /><br />I also find it strange that even though Ollivier demands that we 'be ourselves' proudly, she benchmarks 'French' traits as those to which every woman would wish to aspire.  Again, I find it okay to agree or disagree--if Madame B. accepts her husband's indiscretions, why should I care?  What I do is my own business and not for public consumption--is this a French idea?  NO, I am not French, simply wise enough to know that you cannot change people.  Ollivier's stereotypical French girl exists in all of us in bits and pieces.  Yet, let's face it, she conforms to her idea of what she needs to be in her own environment.  If we are comfortable enacting a repressed Anglo-Saxon persona it is probably because this is what was taught from the cradle and what our neighbors enact--does Ollivier expect an instant resolution to change?  How can one be oneself and change due to advice given in a book?  Impossible unless an environment change actually results.<br /><br />The section I enjoyed the most was the one dedicated to food.  I know the French enjoy eating with gusto; many courses of rich food all washed down with large quantities of red wine.  Fat and cholesterol are never considered and certainly not mentioned---why ruin a good meal? Can you imagine a French woman measuring her food to adhere to the principles of the Zone?  Or not eating certain foods because of her blood type?  Yet, as the author states, the French woman looks nothing like her American counterpart as she ages; she may change with time, but not in the dramatic way an American does. Why? What is the secret?  In a nutshell, food enhances one's life--but one does not live to eat.  Ollivier states that food shopping is done everyday--not as a chore, but as a way of life--socializing with those who provide food foryour table.  No cars necessary, walking, conversing and choosing are leisurely activities--no stress associated with 'running errands'.  Only the freshest food is purchased; the ensuing meal revolves around what is seasonable, fresh and readily available.  Little is left over or stocked in the refrigerator; the French woman buys only what she needs, never more.  Portions are then only portions; no meals-in-a-box with preservatives are utilized at all.  Although this explanation has been pointed out before by many other writers, dieticians and health care providers, Ollivier encapsulates the concept with fun food for thought.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This book is fun to read and provides many enjoyable suggestions for film-viewing ideas and other streamlining projects (closet and refrigerator in particular). I do not think it is meant to be taken very seriously. Perhaps, you, like me, will enjoy the tribute to individuality and rather than adapt to so-called French ways, celebrate fully what is different about yourself---you never know, you may be writing your own book someday sharing all your own personal secrets!s necessary, walking, conversing and choosing are leisurely activities--no stress associated with 'running errands'.

This is not to say that I thought the book uninteresting or boring in any way.  On the contrary, the storyline moves along, albeit the pre-historical plotline jars pathetically with the author's modern jargon leaving the reader no choice but to roll one's eyes upward in utter amazement at the blatant inconsistency.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a somewhat undefined 'game' at which a labyrinth plays an integral part in protecting the city in which it is located.  With the anger of a spurned woman, Ariadne of Crete beseiges her half-man half-bull brother Asterion to teach her the dark ways that will help her destroy the power of the labyrinth after Theseus throws her over for her younger sister.  Of course, as mistress of the labyrinth, she leaves a backdoor for herself and her female progeny--a way in which to recreate the game in a future time and reclaim her power.  Approximately 100 years later, Ariadne's heir Genvesa is all but ready, however she needs a King man to help her dance the mystical powers of the game back into being and forever trap Asterion in the center of the maze.  Trojan Brutus, adept at the game, is her man and through a series of ploys and adventures, Genvesa lures him from Greece to the misty land of Albion--the southern portion of the British Isles.  One crucial problem arises to snag Genvesa's plans when Brutus impulsively takes Cornelia, the daughter of a conquered king, as his wife and drags her along on his quest for the promised land of New Troy. In Albion, Genvesa has all but destroyed the old god and goddess that ruled the island.  When the Albion mother goddess, Mag, Genvesa's chief foe, hides within Cornelia, Genvesa's plans to reconstruct the game are almost permanently foiled.<br /><br />As you can imagine, this tale is long and fraught with the machinations of all characters who seek either self-preservation or the heady power of pure domination.  Douglass cleverly combines many myths to support her premise and to bring alive the baser natures of her creations.  However trite, there is sex, gore and raw emotion galore, so much so that I found myself wincing with disgust at many of the too descriptive passages enlightening the reader to scenes of birth, death and utter savagery.  The characters seem to be intentionally crafted as archetypes like the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece rather than real fleshed out personas. Brutus lives only for the power of kingship and possession of Genvesa.  Cornelia, raped and torn from her family and country, somehow improbably forgets her grief and yearns for love from her brutal husband.  Genvesa connives with a hallowe'en witch's malevolence while the rest of the cast are simply not finely drawn enough to not be categorized as either good or evil.  All characters are either blighted with trite dialogue or overly long-winded emotional explosions.<br /><br />Bottom line:  While the story will keep your attention, none of the characters are subtle enough to capture your emotions; they are stylized shadows which at times fail to elicit much response other than a shrug and a turn of the page.  The literary style fails to recreate a feel for ancient times, rather it attributes modern day sensibilities to otherwise primordial savages.

As another 'daughter of the forest', Liaden prefers her home to all else; she grows and distills her own herbal treatments to heal sympathetically as her mother before her.  Like Sorcha, she too has the ability to 'see' and 'mind talk' and it comes as no surprise that the Fair Ones of the Forest will soon intervene in her peaceful existence.  Amidst an atmosphere of turmoil involving the recovery of the three sacred isles from the Britons and clandestine assignations and alliances formed with mercenaries and traitorous compatriots, Liaden [a little too] admirably struggles with the task set before her by the Fair Ones in fulfilling her connection with the prophesy of a child born under the sign of the raven.<br /><br />Although the story moves along at a pace similar to that of its predecessor, it lacks much of the magic of 'Daughter of the Forest'. Half-wild Finbar's confusion transforms to a pragmatic resignation as he channels his 'power' to tutor his formidable niece in the art of the mind. I liked him better as the forlorn creature helplessly staring after his swan mate and cygnets.  As a main character, Liaden possesses Sorcha's strength, but we as readers do not sympathize as fully with her as we did her mother.  Where Sorcha's silence elicited compassion, Liaden's too trite doggedness pushes her into the realm of cookie-cutter characterization. Instead of grinning with delight, the reader finds this exaggerated idealism causes yawns of boredom. Rather than luxuriating in the feelings conjured up in 'Daughter of the Forest', we are left with structure rather than substance--the characters here are delineated by their purpose in moving the novel towards its climax rather than their ability to engage us with a more fully fleshed out humanity.<br /><br />Sadly, in 'Son of the Shadows', veterans Sorcha and Red are backburnered too quickly; the magic of their relationship is relegated to the childhood memories of the new more militant narrator.  Marieller remedies this fading of their romance with a hot new intense relationship between Liaden and her chosen---one that she fuels well with so much subtle feeling I felt myself reading through this portion of the story without a sense of real time passing.  However, once love is declared, Liaden fails somewhat despite what Marieller has set up as her overall strengths--she becomes too steadfast in her beliefs, she never falters, always seeming to have an inner vision as to the right path.  This perfect quality prevents her from getting under your skin the way Red does in 'Daughter of the Forest'--he says little but his calmness and exactitude speaks volumes. In the most pivotal scenes between Liaden and her lover, Liaden does not seem to engage--her dialogue is forced, supposed to be funny but under the vast emotional circumstances, delivers like stale Lifetime movie parlance. Likewise, Bran could have been a great character--he is tortured, yet strong, however the mysteries of his past are derived by the reader way before Liaden's so-so climatic mind healing at the end of the novel.<br /><br />Nevertheless, 'Son of the Shadows' continues in the misty narrative realm set up in 'Daughter of the Forest'.  It is well worth the read, in spite of its faults.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I feel that Marieller's strength lies in her ability to explore the romantic chemistry between two unlike characters.  Some of her scenes are forged with great subtlty and deserve to be read over and over again; others are simply rushed and need less obvious hints to their outcome.s Sorcha and Red are backburnered too quickly; the magic of their relationship is relegated to the childhood memories of the new more militant narrator.

Using the well-known fairy tale as a base, Marillier achieves the impossible, not only bringing the story to life with the words of her young narrator, but embellishing the original with her own subtle imaginings of love, honor and power of the unknown.  As Sorcha spins, she grows; the nettle ruins her hands, but not her heart.  As mad and alien as she may seem, this Irish lass captures the bold heart of a Briton, the unlikely protector the Fairy People have set in her path to keep her safe and whole after so much hand-wringing sorrow. The gooseflesh-raising unspoken interplay between these two characters defines Marillier as a fine mistress of romance.<br /><br />Whether or not you enjoy romance set against a backdrop of misty Celtic fantasy, or fantasy spiked with a love so sweet you will read until the wee hours of the morning, you will cherish the unfolding promise that lies at the center of &quot;Daughter of the Forest.&quot;  The writing is a lyrical ode to that sweet core of passion that lies within us all.  I look forward to reading the second of the Sevenwaters Trilogy and recommend this, the first, to all.	2003-06-04

While the book is funny, I was disappointed to discover that it really was not about France or the French---the essay entitled \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", indeed narrates the author's amusing and insightful struggle with learning the French language while at a language school in Paris, but it is only one out of perhaps four or five essays about France, the majority of the book deals with Sedaris' issues with himself and his colorful family back in the US.  (Now, please, just because I am warning those Amazon customers who wish to purchase a book about France and the French and were directed to this book by listamania listings, don't immediately click the \\"no\\" button as if the rest of my review isn't worth reading. Alas, I was sadly misdirected as most likely others are, too and should not be penalized for telling the truth as I see it. Nor should anyone rate anyone's review negatively simply because it expresses an alternative opinion.)  Because of this misdirection, I read the first half of this book--which has nothing to do with France--with anticipation of when France and the French were going to pop up in the author's humorous anecdotes and musings regarding this understanding of life.  By the time I got to the second part, where Sedaris travels to Paris with his boyfriend, I had already realized that this book of essays was just that: a book of essays containing only a few essays about France.  I confess to skimming through the contents of each essay before deeming it worthy of my time--sorry to those of you who simply love everything Sedaris--and I will say that the French essays in the book are well worth the read---I just wish there had been a whole book dedicated to just this topic.<br /><br />Therefore, if like myself, you have happened upon this page simply to read a book about France, save your money and either read the few French themed essays in the library or bookstore. Buy instead \\"On Rue Tatin\\"--the telling of an American woman and her husband who buy an old convent north of Paris or any of the Provence books by UK author Mayle. These books are not meant to be funny in a satirical manner, but instead convey an idea of the French and their country from alien prospectives.book dedicated to just this topic.  <BR><BR>Therefore, if like myself, you have happened upon this page simply to read a book about France, save your money and either read the few French themed essays in the library or bookstore.

Again he travels to the provinces of Southern Italy and explores through the stories of its people, the specific ideals that differentiate him from his American counterparts. His findings are conclusive: the Italians of the immigrant generation may not have been literate, but they passed on a wealth of values that cannot be denied.<br /><br />If you are Italian American, you will happily digest Paolicelli's ruminations regarding his ethnicity; I guarantee they lend a hand in helping you formulate your own unanswered questions regarding your place in our pluralistic American society.	2003-05-24

Her reminiscences regardng her assimilation into French village/city life enchant; each of the personnages comes to life--in fact, I would have enjoyed---even more so---a book double the size with more information regarding each of Madame Loomis' neighbors!  In addition to detailing the work necessary to make their house purchase inhabitable, Susan recalls the sometimes difficult adjustments her young son makes in order to &quot;fit in&quot; to the French education system and the reluctant diplomacy required by Susan and her husband when dealing with the uncomfortable stubborness of the resident cure.  Cleverly sprinkled throughout are Susan's thoughts regarding French sensibilites when compared with their American counterparts.  At the end of each vignette, Loomis provides a fabulously apropos selection of recipes, simple, yet delicious which she either serves her friends/acquaintances or receives from appreciative French gourmands during the actual occurance of the chapter events. (I would have liked the recipe for the black current sorbet she speaks of at the end of the 'Paris' chapter.) The last recollection contains the lovely history of Susan's experience in a French clinic as she awaits her second child.  C'est formidable!<br /><br />The idea of pairing good food with wonderful memories certainly evokes anyone's idea of the good life.  Recommended to all who love good food, wine, the French and are teased by the idea of at least attending one of Susan Loomis cooking sessions in Louviers.	2003-05-17

The result, as Dick Young, narrator of \\"the House on the Strand\\" discovers, catapults Dick's mind back into the depths of his genetic memory where modern Cornwall transforms to a battleground where a bloodthirsty struggle between 14th century landowners rages at a slightly accelerated pace from that of the present.  As intriguing as the reader may find this premise, Dick Young finds it all the more so.  For with each dose of the drug, Dick's body and mind become addicted to this otherworld, so much so that he ignores the responsibilities of his present life and places his marriage, livelihood and life in jeopardy.<br /><br />As in other Du Maurier tales where she employs a male narrator, Dick falls prey to an older mentor, in this case biochemist researcher and designer of the genetic memory drug, Magnus Lane. (Oddly, although not biologically related, both Magnus and Dick conjur up the same historical characters as they 'journey' back to the Cornwall of the 14th century.) Interlaced within their perfect and insular relationship lies the same exclusionary sense experienced between Philip and Ambrose (My Cousin Rachel) and John and Jean (The Scapegoat)that no outsiders are welcome, particularly women---as in all these stories, the major woman character is either murdered or harmed in some dire way.<br /><br />If the reader is expecting a time travel tale where the voyager entangles himself in the past, find another book.  Dick serves as a guinea pig in this plotline; he observes the past through the conduit of the drug.  The main gist of the novel revolves around Dick's all-consuming addiction rather than his experiences in another time.<br /><br />Du Maurier uses real historical personnages in her depiction of Dick's \\"trips\\".  The 'House on the Strand' was a house she actually lived in and whose past she researched.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Du Maurier's knack of transporting the reader into the head of her narrator, eliciting both sympathy and emotional terror simultaneously.and whose past she researched.

One of her older twin brothers, Alex, killed in a tragic automobile accident leaves the family circling like buzzards over the remains of the family estate, a wealthy racehorse stud and training farm.  Imagine when out of the blue, after eight long years away, Karen steps back into their lives and inherits the property and the 14 million dollars that goes with it.<br /><br />Suddenly, Karen finds herself in the center of unwanted attention, particularly male attention.  When she finds herself falling in love, Karen must factor her newfound wealth into her analysis of her true feelings.  In addition to this, she realizes that before Alex's death, he and his twin Nick were playing what they called, \\"the Gemini Game\\", a game where they switched places just for fun . . . as she wrestles with the game's implications, she discovers that her inheritance has put her own life in jeopardy . . .<br /><br />As you can see, this novel includes all the right ingredients for a few hours of escapist reading.  Although Kearsley's more recent novels contain more complicated plot twists and some elements of the supernatural, her talent shines through in this smaller work.  Immediately the character of Karen engages; Kearsley's knack of making the ordinary come to life works well with her sense of timing and story-telling ability.

As it contains more that 700 pages, the book provides a virtual around-the-world-in-80-days adventure quest involving a young graduate student in search of her errant mentor, an aging theology professor financed by the University of Chicago to lay hands on a missing gospel of one of the original disciples of Jesus.  Sadly, the novel's most troubled aspect is in its trite characterizations.  Lucy, the grad student represents the quintessential Catholic school girl laden with Irish Catholic guilt while Paddy, the professor in his deluded quest for notarity in the academic world, soaks himself with alcohol from all points of the globe.  The only character worthwhile, the Holy Spirit, speaks in asides which are insightful and mildly amusing.<br /><br />However, if you can get past the rather annoying personalities of the two main characters, focus on the gospel itself that heads each of the major chapter breaks, and enjoy how its revelation awakens the protagonists to their real missions in life, then the book can be called successful.<br /><br />I was recommended this book after having read the www.Amazon.com reviews of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown.  I must say that I was mislead; the books have little in common--Brown's style is much breezier, more in the adventure/screenplay genre--his focus is mainly on the unfolding mystery.  Barnhardt's epistle deals more with the change in his characters than the actual plot--I think I would have liked more plot and less character.  Barnhardt's resolution at the last chapter called \\"The Promised Land\\"  mercifully comes off as campy in an otherwise seemingly serious tale of two lost souls that find their way back to an ever patient Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Barnhardt's research combined with his imagination makes the book seem factual--it is his immense database of knowledge that urges the reader forward through to the end.<br /><br />Recommended to those who like conspiracy theories and hidden ancient mysteries.o those who like conspiracy theories and hidden ancient mysteries.	2003-05-14

Books	3	7	12	N	N	Josephine B---Sad and Resigned	After viewing the A&E presentation of \\"Napoleon\\", I wanted to reacquaint myself with Bonaparte, his wild family and his great love, Josephine.  I remembered Annemarie Selinko's novel \\"Desiree\\", which tells in diary format the tale of Napoleon's first love, Desiree Clary, daughter to a Marsielles silk merchant.  After reading a few pages, I realized that having read it so many times in the past, I almost knew each of Desiree's adventures by heart.  Gulland's trilogy about Josephine popped up as a suggestion written in an Amazon review of \\"Desiree.\\"  In fact, the reviewer claimed she enjoyed \\"Josephine B.\\" far better than my beloved \\"Desiree\\".  I purchased the novel that afternoon and was pleased to finish it within 24 hours.<br /><br />I am not going to tout this novel as the greatest historical piece I have ever read. Gulland's Josephine, if living in modern times, would most definitely be diagnosed clinically depressed and fed a daily dose of either Paxil or Prozac; her strength and ability to pass through tragedy is a resigned one.  She accepts rather than demands.  However, despite the main character's quiet accpetance, the novel does seem to be thoroughly researched---Gulland stars many items in her prose and footnotes in easily read explanations many of the comments and idiomatic conversations of her characters with historical citations.  And, once you pick up this first novel of the trilogy also written in diary format, your eyes will move along at a break-neck pace; page upon page will pass from one side to the other and you will delve into the unintentionally hazardous life of a woman swept away by uncertain times.<br />  We meet fourteen year old  \\"Rose\\" or Marie-Josephe-Rose Tascher in Martinique where a voodoo woman adequately predicts the events that will haunt and and steer her life.  She is to marry unhappily, become a widow and then a queen.<br /><br />Indeed as we follow Rose from Martinique to Paris, we share her most intimate thoughts regarding her lot in life---a woman forced to marry someone she did not love and ignore the humiliation of his many indescrations.  Rose is not a femme fatale; she does not think of herself as a great beauty, in fact she worries constantly about her bad teeth, keeping her lips shut tightly whenever in society.  Gulland depicts a very real woman whom the reader can well imagine is as ordinary as him/herself.  At the same time, the reader can comprehend the role the savage revolutionary times played in shaping her life.<br /><br />Above all we savor Rose as a loving mother who would sacrifice anything for her children.  We commiserate with her loneliness and forgive her her resigned acceptance of her lot in the great scheme of things.<br /><br />Bonaparte appears only at the end of this installment.  Wildly ambitious and oddly intense, he focuses on Rose as part of his destiny while she again seems resigned to deal with what sadness life offers to her.<br />I will read the second part of this trilogy (I have already purchased it)but I will wait until I am again ready to step into Josephine's rather sad existence.  Hopefully this portion of her life with Napoleon will grant her some delicious release and abandonment of her travails. Since Napoleon will eventually divorce Josephine for the sake of producing an heir for his throne, I think I will forego the third and last part of this trilogy.  I think \\"Desiree\\" a far more satisfying read in terms of the positive power one person has with regard to the history of nations.

As in 'Ice Limit', there is a meteor, a team of scientists, and an odyessy where things go wrong because of misguided yet fiercely intense men and women whose behind-the-scene personal agendas leave the rest of humanity something to be desired.  But 'Deception Point' departs from 'Ice Limit' at this point and carries the meteor story into the political backyard of the presidency, an inscrupulous candidate and Washington's aggressive internal mechanism of disclosing information to the public at highly critical and crucial moments to gain the most spin and clout available.<br /><br />Using short chapters and multiple points of third person point of view narration, Brown weaves an interesting story that albeit formula, still keeps the reader engaged.  His characters are merely conduits for the fast action story, so don't expect any masterful renderings in this department.  Do, however, enjoy Brown's skill in seeding his purely imaginative story with enough of today's politics and headlines to satisfy and refuel even the most die-hard conspiracy theory disbelievers.  Sadly, I see this novel becoming a movie of the week thriller with less than believable characters attempting to flesh out Brown's already thin creations---hopefully this will not happen--this genre like Preston and Child's works should remain within the pages of a fast-paced novel where it works best.<br /><br />Recommend for all those who want a fast read that will engage during a day at the beach or a long plane flight.	2003-04-21

Unfortunately, this book cannot be categorized as either romantic suspence adventure or campy haunted house horror.  At the very most its story revolves around grim happenstance spotlighting a woman obsessed with dire possibilities which she worries to death.  Woe to the reader who empathizes with the negative, and swallowed by it, finds herself/himself unable to reach the same intended life-affirming lesson/message at the end of the book along with our too savvy main character.<br /><br />The story should engage, but somehow it does not. After all the moody grief, there is no intellectualized savoring of the taste of strawberries as the author infers in her last paragraph. There is nothing but sour repellent mood, which most readers, expecting at least a powerful ghost story will abandon after the first 100 pages.<br />  Emma and her family move out to Long Island and inhabit a large secluded house perched atop a Northshore village flanked by the Long Island Sound. Her husband, Roger, is a smart WASP physicist.  Emma is a Jewish writer with socialist tendencies she feels she is betraying by leaving her urban nest of ethnicity. But this is not her only problem---someone is targeting Emma in a dangerous game of malice that tampers her livelihood, her sanity and eventually her life.  Because of events that occurred in the past, Roger does not always believe in the validity of Emma's spin on reality. Hence, Emma finds herself isolated at a time in her life where she needs the security of strong friends and family.<br /> Sounds potentially interesting, doesn't it?  Well, it loses something in the writing.  Narrated in the third person present, the format retains a choppy feel where the author uses too many literary analogies which seem forced, a little too light in atmosphere for the otherwise gloomy ambiance conjured up by the prose.  Yes, Emma is a writer, but even so, I felt the author's choice of Emma's career a betrayal of sorts, Rogan utilizes her own personal experience rather than research a more appropriate and far less solitary and depressing form of employment for a woman already stretched to the limit and far too alone.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book isn't any fun.

Amira, the family matriarch, married at thirteen and accustomed to wearing the veil and remaining within the walls of her domain on Virgins of Paradise Street in Cairo, retains a secret past locked deep within her that shames her with its elusive mystery, yet at the same time endows her with the strength to rule her family with a loving decisiveness that never fails her.  Ibrahim, her son, wants a son of his own so badly, that he curses God and spends the rest of his life wondering if his ill-spoken words have cursed his ability to sire male children.  Yasmina, Ibrahim's daughter, follows the mandates her grandmother dictates, marries and has a son, but decides to follow her own heart and become a doctor.  Carmelia, her sister, pursues a different path; flouting Amira's old-fashioned ways, she becomes a famous Eastern dancer.  Zachariah, the house's adopted son, inherits too much of his biological father's dreamy idealism, seeking the paradise of God rather than its earthly alternative.  All the Rasheeds struggle against the times, the old ways, a newer thinking and what they intrinsically know is morally correct.<br /><br />Wood weaves her family epic with informative facts about the Middle East.  The reader witnesses a female circumcision firsthand along with the perspectives of the participating women.  The powerlessness of woman within a society where she wields little power outside the walls of the harem is illustrated through the events experienced by most of the women characters.  Wood manages to adequately portray these women as religiously fervent and yet striving for personal freedom without being overly preachy. Her research into the Arab world is to be commended---meeting the Rasheeds amounts to exposing yourself to an otherwise alien world.<br /><br />There are times when Wood repeats herself.  One has to wonder if certain parts of the story are written out of sequence and never edited or if Wood thinks that after so many pages have been digested a gentle reminder of what transpired 150 pages back is needed.<br /><br />Like other such 'BIG' novels, Virgins of Paradise has its predictable moments, but for the most part, it is an enjoyable and not overly literary story in which to delve--especially if, like myself, you listen to the unabridged audio version, wonderfully performed by Brilliance Corporation in a 19 hour format.eeting the Rasheeds amounts to exposing yourself to an otherwise alien world. <BR> <BR>There are times when Wood repeats herself.

Since this equation obviously worked for Brown before, he does not hesitate to use it again, but leaves a few loose strings in particular Langdon's affection for Vittoria from the previous book which is not-so-neatly dismissed and substituted by his relationship with French cryptologist, Sophie, in this one.<br /><br />In spite of its similarity to the first Langdon adventure, the reader cannot help but get involved in this story full throttle. The insight into some of the historical characters intrigues and delights; the knowledge of secret societies, their roster of historical luminaries and their interplay with age-old adversaries like the Vatican boggles the mind. Dismiss Langdon and the other characters who are not fully fleshed out--- its important to realize that they are mere conduits who provide speech and action for the true main characters--the puzzles and ciphers that account for the page-turning effect that you will experience once you start this novel. True conspiracy theory aficionados will guess many of the puzzles, but honestly, that just adds to the smug fun---the final resolution is one that I never guessed and yet fully enjoyed.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" provides at least 24 hours of mind stimulation that anyone who wishes a fully engaged break from today's reality will appreciate. Brown documents his work with a sprinkling of book citations mentioned through the dialogue; he should have provided a bibliography for those who want to separate fact from his imagined fiction. The novel's format--short chapters told third person from the different vantage points of the police, the religious operatives, and the hero and heroine, Langdon and Sophie move the plot along at a breakneck speed that is reminiscent of Michael Crichton's style in Jurassic Park and Timeline. I recommend this book to anyone who indulges in escapist fiction with that hint of reality that keeps you wondering if what you believe in is really valid or simply propaganda.e fact from his imagined fiction.

Ariantes has swore an oath to the Roman Emperor and as a man who does not take any promise lightly, he would rather die than submit his name to dishonor.  However, as a prince of a conquered people, Ariantes finds himself reduced to leading his squadron of men in the strange world of the Romans where diplomacy and deceit walk hand in hand.  Ariantes' simpler life of breeding horses, making war and caring for his family disappears in the blink of an eye as he and his troops make camp on the not completely Romanized isle of Britain, near Hadrian's Wall.  Yet Ariantes adapts; he finds himself negotiating for his men in matters of pay, rations and privileges and devising schemes to keep the hot headed Sarmatians from fighting amongst themselves to avoid the stricter penalties of Roman justice.  As Ariantes manipulates the Roman system to better accommodate his men, he struggles to understand the customs of his conquerors and of the British tribes he and his men have sworn to simultaneously protect and keep down.  Above all Ariantes remains true to himself and to what his people believe in.  When he finds himself embroiled in a plot involving druids, the Pict tribe, an ambitious woman and two of his Sarmatian brothers, his true nobility is put to the test.<br /><br />Like her other historical novels, Island of Ghosts provides an interesting glimpse into a world where inner strength defines true courage.  This portrayal of a man uprooted from his home and his assimilation into a foreign place with different values speaks universally to anyone coming in contact with a new environment.  Recommended to all who love historical fiction and a strong male character who will not knuckle under political forces.	2003-04-12
US	53093124	R2OCMFEGC1FWV9	0312251882	511848995	Dances with Luigi: A Grandson's Determined Quest to Comprehend Italy and the Italians	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Francesco's Gift	When I picked up &quot;Dances With Luigi&quot;, I thought the author would put into writing thoughts that I, as a third generation Italian American would relate to in some wonderfully metaphysical way.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />Firstly, the title has nothing to do with the actual theme of the author's journey.  I suppose Mr. Paolicelli intended to interperse his musings with his Umbrian landlord, Luigi, as chapter endings, to further enlighten his findings about his family, and the Italians of the Mezzogiorno region of Italy.  But, these revelations do not occur consistently enough to warrant the honor of a title. Luigi, a man living through his own tragedy, merely comes along for the ride and acts only, at times, as Paolicelli's sounding board. I believe that Mr. Paolicelli, as a television journalist, intended to follow New Yorker magazine's Adam Gopnik lead in his 'Paris to the Moon' essays that eventually formulated a bestselling book. This would account for some of the redundance in descriptions and events from chapter to chapter that as individual essays would need the refreshment of repeated explanation.<br /><br />However, this observation is minor.  My main problem with 'Dances With Luigi' is that it succeeds only in telling the story of one specific grandson searching for his grandfather's records; it fails in becoming universally emblematic for all the rest of the third and fourth generation Italian Americans in America who know nothing about their roots in Italy.  Paolicelli is lucky that he knew anything about his grandfather's life in Italy; many of us were told nothing.  The southern Italians wanting nothing more than freedom from the oppression of the Risorgimento government and the prejudice of the Northern Italians.  They wanted a better life and chose a strange place with unfamiliar sights and sounds, in spite of their immense sense of family and tradition, over the repression they knew in their homeland. Paolicelli touches on this a little when he talks about his grandfather's obsession with the needs of his children rather than those of himself.  For that generation, as in all other founding American generations, the past was over, the present endured and the future awaited.<br /><br />I am pleased that Mr. Paolicelli found his grandfather's records, but more so that he found a sense of his future----a future that he speaks of only when he describes his musical triumphs and more concretely in a very small epilogue.  I sense he finally understands the unselfishness of these strong people of America's past.<br /><br />I would have rather heard more about how Paolicelli realized his grandfather's dream, rather than the goings on in a homeland that our grandparents wanted to forget. Perhaps more of the reasons why his family specifically left Italy would have been revealing.  The book should have been called Francesco's Gift in honor of his grandfather, who gave him a name, a life without stuggle and a dream for the future.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I will recommend the book to all Italian Americans that have that itch for understanding.he talks about his grandfather's obsession with the needs of his children rather than those of himself.

When her grandmother dies, Carrie pleased to inherit the house, struggles with mixed emotions regarding her own need for freedom and her determination to be a good wife.  Her husband wants the house sold quickly and complains about her need to settle Italian legalities in person. However, his avarious nature lends to allowing her to undertake the trip without his company.  Upon her arrival, Carrie senses real freedom for the first time from her husband's imposed mediocrity.  She finds sexual release in the form of her handsome yet WWI battle-haunted cousin, Leo and mystery in the secrets kept by her grandmother's long-time companion, Maria. Carrie finds her actions strangely paralleling those of her grandmother; only through her own strength does she find the courage to combat the obstacles set in front of her and follow her own path.<br /><br />Crane's language is simple; the story unfolds from Carrie's perspective although it is not told in the first person.  We sense Carrie's unhappiness perhaps a bit repeatedly; Crane's background information regarding Carrie is a bit trite, something any reader of romance is over familiar with.  Carrie's eventual understanding of the situation between herself and her cousin dawns slowly and painfully; the denouement is not as knife-sharp as one would wish, nor are Carrie's musings quite so relevant at the end of the novel as she sits pondering in her grandmother's garden.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I have read so many romances, that I found this one so easy to pigeonhole.  However, that does not detract from the overall tone or sense of place that Crane renders so well.  I recommend this small sad little story to new discoverers of the romance genre---those interested in an operatic plot with little bodice ripping will be quite pleased.will be quite pleased.	2003-03-26

Before reading this book, you must clear your mind of preceptions inferred by critics insisting that Du Maurier is a writer of romance.  First and foremost, Du Maurier writes about murderers.  Like Patricia Highsmith, she masterfully allows you to see through their eyes and feel all that they feel regarding the misdeed they contemplate or have already committed. As in most of her male-narrated fictions, you will find yourself so enthralled by the circumstances observed and described that you inadvertantly cheer for and empathize with a protagonist as immoral as Highsmith's Tom Ripley is ammoral.<br /><br />Philip Ashley is such a creation.  Here, you must depart from Richard Burton's 1953 movie version of this character---in the film of the same name, we watch a young and beautiful Burton pout and snarl rather than see the events through his eyes.  In the novel, Philip is the product of a woman-free household.  He is young, sheltered and almost churlish from his lack of society.  Living on a large Cornish estate with his older cousin Ambrose, Philip is groomed in tradition--he will run the Ashley estate and become a magistrate like his cousin before him; he has no need for women fussing about him.  In short, he has learned Ambrose's lessons quite well.  Imagine his surprise when Ambrose departs for Italy and months later writes back to inform Philip and the staff at the estate that he has taken a wife--a half-Italian distant cousin, Rachel Sangiletti.  Compound this surprise with letters received from Ambrose describing a deteriorating health punctuated with headaches, violent outbursts and an apprehensive distrust of his wife's frivilousness with regard to money.  When Ambrose suddenly dies, Philip finds himself in a frenzy of his own; his target, the unsuspecting Rachel, newly-arrived in Cornwall with Ambrose's possessions.  Prepared to hate her, Philip encounters a woman far different from what he expected.  Like his mentor, Ambrose, Philip falls in love with her and similarly follows the road that Ambrose traveled where his misogynic training is turned on its ear. Only when Philip's rosy picture of Rachel is tested by actions Philip doesn't quite understand, does his world cloud with Ambrose's ingrained suspicions.<br /><br />This novel truely unlocks the door to Philip's mind and emotions.  We see only through Philip's point of view; Rachel, although the book is named after her, is a secondary figure--a shadow not quite comprehended by our hero.<br /><br />This book is definitely recommended to all those who have enjoyed 'Rebecca'--I imagined Rachel to be like Rebecca, knowingly or unknowingly inciting their rather solitary men to committing acts of extreme violence.  The wicked question Du Maurier leaves floating around in the reader's mind is this:  Are Rebecca and Rachel evil women who justifiably are killed--- or ---are they just women who serve no other good function but to die?similarly follows the road that Ambrose traveled where his misogynic training is turned on its ear.

Her analysis of Du Maurier's work vehemently disputes Du Maurier's dismissal by critics; Auerbach finds her male centered stories brimming with fully drawn characters that derive their strength from a violent/murderous reaction to the females who enter their lives.  Du Maurier's female narrators (1st person or otherwise) depend upon their omnipotent male counterparts for identity; the so-called romances of Rebecca, Jamaica Inn and Frenchman's Creek are not driven by love as they are erroneously depicted in the corresponding movie adaptations, but revolve around the transition of the female acquiescing to the strength of the male and becoming dependent on him for identity and definition.  These female protagonists, like Du Maurier, herself, initially possess the characteristics of young boys and only become women by losing their independence.  Above all, Auerbach describes Du Maurier's haunted inheritance: the necessity of keeping of her heritage alive as initiated by her grandfather George, author of 'Trilby' and her actor father ,Gerald.<br /><br />This is not a biography of Daphne Du Maurier, but rather a literary critique of her many novels and fantastic short stories.  As it relates to Du Maurier's fiction, Auerbach eludes to Du Maurier's penchant towards lesbianism, citing Margaret Forster's book, &quot;Daphne Du Maurier: The Secret Life of the Renowned Storyteller&quot; as her source.  She analyzes the movie adaptations, finding Hitchcock's 'Rebecca', 'Jamaica Inn' and 'The Birds' inferior to the original thoughts as penned by the author, herself.<br /><br />As I have found myself compelled over the years to reread Daphne Du Maurier's lesser known masterpieces, like 'The House on the Strand', 'The Scapegoat', and 'My Cousin Rachel', I fully understand Auerbach's fascination with the author and the strange almost spellbinding hold she has over her readers.  I recommend this book to anyone who has been under the Du Maurier spell and realizes that she is much, much more than just a escapist romance writer.

When Waldo sectioned her original manuscript, the strong and compelling style of her earlier work Sacajawea was muddled, resulting in a straightforward chronological genesis that neither intrigues or elicits the reader's interest.<br /> This first offering deals solely with Brenda, a Welsh handmaiden of the 12th century, mistress of Owain, prince of Wales whose son, Madoc, purportedly reached the Americas way before Columbus and may have founded the Mandan Indian tribe of North Dakota.  Brenda loves Owain, but as one of his concubines, has little power to pursue her dream of becoming a Druid healer.  When her third child is born and Owain demands that she give up this child to his bereaved wife or drown him, Brenda decides to flee Wales for Ireland.  She successfully protects her child, Madoc, from their pursuers and only after he is fostered does she return reluctantly to Wales where Owain and his household engulf her again with their day-to-day intrigues. As Owain ages, Brenda finds herself in the tumultuous position of make-shift counselor. Fearfully, she watches as his older sons battle for a foothold in their father's realm; one in particular will use any means to gain control of his father's power.  Her one hope is Madoc, whom the druids prophesized would accomplish great things for the Welsh people. When he appears in Wales a man grown, she finds he is the lightbearer to a path where she can realize her own dreams and simultaneously aid him in fullfilling his destiny.<br /><br />All the elements of a great historical drama are utilized in 'Circle of Stones', however, their allignment fails to achieve anything beyond a mediocre telling of the tale.  Brenda curries no distinguishing character traits that memorialize her in fiction.  Owain merely struts and then dodders and drools in a most unsatisfying predictable sequence of events that is meant to illustrate the threat Wales faced in an uneasy alliance with the English king Henry.  Rather than compel, the third person narrative style employed by Waldo, bores.  I have no intention of picking up the next volume of the trilogy.  Instead I will research the Mandan Indians and their connection to the Welsh via the library and the Internet.

Everyone has heard the old adage, \\"If you don't use it, you lose it.\\"  Well, this book helps you use your body in ways that will help keep it spry and supple as your age advances with absolutely none of the jolt of high impact exercise.<br /><br />Firstly, I would recommend at least five sessions with a registered Pilates instructor.  Although it is possible to understand the body allignment necessary to perform these exercises optimally by reading the 'Key Elements to Mastering the Mat' chapter of the book, the process is expedited by someone who can 'show' as well as 'tell'.  If instruction is impossible, I would recommend Jennifer Kries instructional tape \\"The Method:Precision Toning\\"; actually seeing the exercises in sequence with Ms. Kries gentle encouragement helps to assimilate the photos in the book into the reality of the motion. Note: the tape does not cover all the positions, but provides enough for a worthy introduction.<br /><br />The book helps the exerciser to understand just what each movement is meant to feel like.  It uses photographs that simulate each progression of movement and written copy that details the procedure step-by-step.  In addition to this, tips regarding how best to engage and hence strengthen the muscles in your powerhouse (abdominals, hips, lower back and buttocks)are provided in bullet fashion.  Most importantly, there are little sketches which help you to visualize the feeling the exercise is meant to arouse within the body.  All exercises are presented in sequence so that they flow from one to another; each exercise is labeled 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced' and features a corresponding model which helps you to delineate based on current level.  Sides series leg exercises follow the basic mat technique and extras using light weights complete the program.  The author, Brooke Siler, cleverly includes a state-by-state list of registered Pilates instructors so that you can learn the basics from a pro.<br /><br />I have used this book for over two years; I have found that the 15 to 30 to 45 minutes I spend on performing these exercises each morning---the time differences reflect wheither I do side series or weights---has enabled me to participate in more rigorous athletic activities without so much as blinking an eye.  Recently I did a mountain bike ride--22 miles--an activity I have not participated in for quite a while----and felt absolutely no pain the next morning.  You will find you use the techniques used to engage the powerhouse all the time, even when just walking down the block.  The Pilates breathing becomes second nature as does all movement from the core.  I will warn you that Pilates is not easy. If you have not participated in some form of body toning for a while, you will definitely feel pain in your abdominals even if you perform just the very basic routine. Don't let this discourage you--I have a C-section pouch that certainly does not help to ease any of the motions---the pain quickly passes and the developing strength provides a good base for all your other activities.  Each movement incorporates toning with stretching--you will actually feel your muscles stretching from the powerhouse and reaching out in ways that traditional stretching never quite realizes.  After performing just the basics for a week, you will immediately understand why professional dancers have used these techniques for over 50 years and why you should, too.<br /><br />Siler's book is the best book on the subject, one that you will consult regularly as you make Pilates one of your exercise mainstays.  Highly recommended.book for over two years; I have found that the 15 to 30 to 45 minutes I spend on performing these exercises each morning---the time differences reflect wheither I do side series or weights---has enabled me to participate in more rigorous athletic activities without so much as blinking an eye.

US	53093124	RWEDM8FWKW4MK	0380725398	474304675	Jamaica Inn	Books	5	28	34	N	N	Gothic Suspense at its Best	In \\"Myself When Young\\", author Daphne DuMaurier tells of a riding expedition on Bodmin Moors where lost and tired, she put up at a local hostelry called Jamaica Inn. \\"It was my first sight of the place that would later grip my imagination . . . a temperance house in 1920, it had been a coaching stop in the old days, and I thought of the travelers in the past who must have sought shelter there on the wild November nights, watched by the local moorland folk. No temperance house then, but a bar where the little parlor was, the drinking deep and long, fights breaking out, the sounds of oaths, of men falling.\\"<br /><br />And grip her imagination it did!<br /><br />Du Maurier brings to life all the sounds and sights she imagined she saw on that day at a wayside inn with so much history. The lonely local, the brooding weather, the harsh tors looming over the moors and the bog, all make for what is now the almost trite accoutrements to any Gothic melodrama. But in Du Maurier's expert hands and imagination, the story that evolves could never be thought hackneyed.<br /><br />Mary Yellen, a staunch working class young lady must leave her beloved farm on southern coast of Cornwall for the bleaker northern side. Here she will live at lonely Jamaica Inn with her mother's sister Patience and her innkeeper husband, Joss Merlyn. When she arrives, Mary, who prides herself on her good sense, intrinsic goodness and her willingness to work, finds her situation at the inn in dire opposition to anything in which she believes. Her heart breaks when she discovers her aunt has become a shadow of her once frivilous self, broken by the drunken Josh and his rude occupation. Mary's dream of travelers stopping at the inn and taking the usual friendly custom aburptly dissipates when she realizes the inn is no longer in use, but like her aunt, is just a shell of what it once was. Most distressing of all, she concludes that Joss's business is a treacherous and nefarious one which instead of commanding the respect of the local villagers and townspeople, causes them to turn away in helpless fear and disgust. Her guilt by association follows quite naturally and Mary vacillates between what she knows is right and her love of her childlike aunt. In her mind, her future spins out before her, likely to trail in the wake of her aunt's disastrous path.<br /><br />The light of hope shines in the appearance of the landlord's brother, Jem. A much younger man than Joss, but similar in looks, Mary can well imagine what had enticed her aunt so many years ago. In spite of herself, she finds she has feelings for Jem that she must put aside as she comes to terms with what she must do for her aunt and her community. Like Du Maurier's other female heroines, Mary eventually succumbs to the world of men; she is dependent, knows it and comes to terms with her lot only by accepting her fate.<br /><br />The story is told in the third person; we eventually discover the secret of Jamaica Inn as Mary does. On all levels, the story and its telling are superior to other books of this genre. Often dismissed as a romantic escape, the novel is nothing of the sort---it rather depicts the marital relationship and other man/woman situations with a violence that is disturbing.  Mary does not find romance, she accepts that Jem is no better than another strong male.  Another aspect of Du Maurier's fanatastic Cornwall comes alive as it did in her other novels, Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel and The House of the Strand. As a backup to the book, rent the Jane Seymour mini-series of the same name. The film representation doesn't really do justice to the literature or theme of Jamaica Inn, it relies instead on the brooding atmosphere and desperation of the heroine's plight rather than the true horror of the man/woman relationships.<br /><br />I have read this book many times, but I find the best way to enjoy it is on unabridged audio--acted by a trained reader brings the words alive and forces you to listen (instead of skipping over) to the passages describing the moors.(instead of skipping over) to the passages describing the moors.	2003-02-06

Happily, it worked--and without having to use Alexander the Great's brute force solution.<br /><br />Vogler uses Joseph Campbell's book &quot;A Hero With a Thousand Faces&quot;, strips off most of the myth retelling and formulates a step-by-step process from Campbell's archetypes that will take your protagonist through the slice-of-life upon which your novel or screenplay centers.<br /><br />You may get the impression that manipulating Vogler/Campbell's formula ensures some degree of commercial success, but that that success will be disappointingly routine, merely run-of-the-mill.  Vogler says 'no'; the hero's journey in the hands of a capable writer can be as fresh, new and different as the film 'Pulp Fiction' is to the animated classic, 'The Lion King' (both films are used as examples in the appendix as to how the basic outline applies). In the first portion of the book, he supplies all of Campbell's hero archetypes with examples which thankfully move beyond Star Wars and the Indiana Jones Trilogy. In the second half of the book, he guides us through a generic hero's journey, providing a variety of options from which to springboard the story.  At the end of each of the journey's legs, he analyzes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to illustrate a most masterful use of the outline and the archetypes.<br /><br />If you are a writer or a student of film, this book 'Cliff-Notes' Campbell's classic.  It provides a greater understanding of what an audience expects from a good story.  If you want a book that again formulates an outline of the hero's journey in a 'how-to' fashion, take a look at &quot;The Key&quot; by Frey--this book is even more simplistic than Vogler's--Frey gets into developing character biographies before setting the hero on his journey, although his example is trite and almost silly.<br /><br />I recommend the book because just reading it will set your mind thinking, sometimes with disgust at the formulas that you can see in all major films, but mostly with some grain of creativity that you can harvest to something special, not just marketable.ur mind thinking, sometimes with disgust at the formulas that you can see in all major films, but mostly with some grain of creativity that you can harvest to something special, not just marketable.	2003-02-05

I purchased this book to help him understand how what he calls his difference from other Americans of European descent will help him understand himself and better define his dreams and desires.  I grew up on Long Island where many of my peers were also Italian American--certainly the melting pot of Irish, Italian, and  Polish middle to upper middle class groupings has little to do with the more mainstream America in which my son matured.  My first foray into the canyons of Wall Street quickly altered my sheltered definition of American society.  Suddenly, ethnicity was not something you declared as easily as your name in an introduction. On the contrary, your surname, ending with that telltale vowel, relegated you to a second ranking of sorts--nothing that was actually said in so many words, but indeed felt.  Not my idea of the American Dream.<br /><br />The title of Maria Laurino's book of essays addresses just this issue.  Were you always an Italian?  I'd have to say 'yes', but I didn't go out of my way to share my culture with anyone that was not of the fold.  I don't think Laurino did either; she speaks knowledgeably of her 'difference', at first speaking of personal differences of food and clothing choices and then citing Harvard sociological studies on the Southern Italian mentality on issues like family, community versus the individual and distrust of outsiders.  She corrects the mistake that many Italian Americans make when they visit 'the homeland' for the first time, erroneously thinking that Florence, Milan and Rome are synonymous with Naples, Corsenza and Palermo. Her study of dialect borders on the hilarious---this is strictly an Italian American viewpoint--no other ethnic group is going to get a kick out of hearing the dialect words compared to their Tuscan Italian equivalents and hear the Naples linguist explain their significance.  Eventually, Laurino's own quest for an understanding of her own ethnic identity takes her to earthquake-torn Calabria where she embraces cousins she never knew she even had.<br /><br />Laurino's book for the most part is a personal journey of ethnic discovery and acceptance for the Italian American who breeches the gap between the immigrant and full-fledged American.  Her particular issues don't always reflect my own, but there is a thread running through each of the individual chapters that resonates some deep chord within me that I thought I'd forgotten.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I enjoyed this book immensely.  I recommend it with the same reservation I made to my son: use it as a kickboard to your own voyage of discovery, don't expect it to answer your specific ethnic assimilation quandries---you're better off speaking to an older relative and actually writing down what this elder statesman tells you so that your adult mind can see what your child's mind wanted to forget.t a kick out of hearing the dialect words compared to their Tuscan Italian equivalents and hear the Naples linguist explain their significance.

Perhaps his rebel status--living on the edge of society, not following the usual conformist formula to gain success titilliates the majority of us who have gone the regular route.  As I am an Italian American, America's fascination with the gangster and his sense of family and his affiliations with the culture and traditions of my own ethnicity strikes me as utterly amusing and ironic. It seems to contradict what Americans have always held sacred: the values of self-reliance and individualism so masterfully illustrated in the essays of Emerson and Thoureau --- values that define the American spirit. So why the Hollywood double, no, the nth-degree take on the Mafia, a body of nonconformists who adhere to their own code of honor in order to skip the assimilation process that all immigrants must undergo to enter into the mainstream American system?<br /><br />Should Italian Americans be annoyed with 'Sopranos' creator, David Chase (an Italian American himself), for yet again portraying the third generational Italian American as the mobster rather than the honest businessman/doctor/lawyer who through higher education and hard work finds himself a rung on the ladder of the American Dream?<br /><br />These are the types questions discussed in &quot;A Sitdown With the Sopranos&quot;.  This extremely serious book contains eight essays, all written by Italian-Americans who have assimilated into the system and are not in the least bit negatively piqued as are the Italian American anti-defammation groups who label the hit HBO television series a 'thumbs down' in almost every conceivable category.  Under the guise of studying the Sopranos, these essays encompass a socialogical spectrum of all things Italian American: religion, the family, the mother/son relationship, culture, father/son relationships, manhood, even a look at how family-centric Italian Americans view such a breach of 'omerta' by participating in such a heinously un-Italian-American act of speaking to the outsider or psychoanalyst rather than a family member or a priest.<br /><br />If you are Italian American, you will get the great satisfaction of knowing that America is enraptured by the Italian American family structure and intrigued by the seemingly exotic religious traditions brought to America by those true purveyors of the American Dream-- your grandparents. The analysis provided in the essays will vocalize some of the issues over which you, as an Italian American, have pondered. You will smile as you realize that your ethnic lifeblood (for surely even with the mob theme running through the Sopranos, you recognize and nod over many of the secret handshakes of Italian American life that before which have never been depicted quite so wonderfully)is suddenly very much in vogue and that your ancestors accomplished their mission. If your're not Italian American, you will recognize that even if Tony Soprano did not go through the usual route of assimilating into the American mainstream, he nevertheless must bow his head (perhaps in the form of his panic attacks) to the change of time and society.  Tony's confronts the same issues that we all confront; he wants his children educated in the best schools, covets the best that life has to offer and yet feels the same spiritual void that many of us do.

Du Maurier's heroine narrates her own story; she is fanciful, as gauche as the prototypical unblossomed teenager who feels everyone is looking at her as she walks down the high school hallway and hears cruel comments whispered at her expense. Imagine our heroine's surprise when handsome urbane widower Max DeWinter spends all his time in Monte Carlo taking her for drives and escorting her to lunch. Think how awed she is when his proposal comes---the dreams she conjurs--the romantic scenarios that bloom in her head with the same wild ferocity as the flowers Maxim tells her grow in profusion around Manderley's grounds. Of course, she accepts and the story changes venue from Monte Carlo to DeWinter's famous estate, Manderley. The narrator's voice becomes more uncertain as she enters Manderley's doors--the house, its servants and the responsibility of actually being mistress of Manderley unnerve and overwhelm her. In particular, the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, emits a frigid aura that our heroine cannot thaw. Over time, we discover that Mrs. Danvers was very much attached to the first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca. In fact,from the new bride's perspective, Rebecca haunts nearly everyone in the story: herself, Max, Mrs. Danvers, Frank, Beatrice, Favel---no one seems to be able to function fully without her. Du Maurier's technique of sharing the narrator's fantasies and fears regarding how she measures up to the legendary Rebecca, adds a masterful bit of psychological tension to all action in the story and helps flesh out the rather insignificant narrator whom Du Maurier didn't even think to name. (Younger readers may find these meanderings a little annoying at times and will want the action to continue rather than indulge in more daydreams. Reading these thoughts aloud rather than skimming over them will add more frazzle to the character's already taut nerves and deepen Manderley's already dark shadows.) Equally intriguing and enigmatic is the character of Max DeWinter, tortured by his loss, so wanting to move on, and so dysfunctionally frozen and unable to do so. Du Maurier creates an unequalled atmosphere of palpable unease. Whether you've read the story before and already know Manderley's secrets or are reading it for the first time, you are in for a finely nuanced treat that elicits many different interpretations of each of the main characters with each reading. This is undoubtably the best Gothic novel of the 20th century--the sequels, Mrs DeWinter and Rebecca's Tale (by different authors) do not compare, even though they are sanctioned by the Du Maurier Estate. Many critics dismiss Rebecca as one of Du Maurier's escapist romances; it is anything but---there is no romance here---the nameless narrator does not escape from the odd happenings manifesting themselves within Manderley's walls to love, she, as all other Du Maurier heriones finds herself trapped, first as a servant to an obnoxious American, then again as a servant to her husband who ultimately controls her every thought and action.

For me, visting a wine shop is a dangerous endeavor; I am dually susceptible to selecting and suspicious of the wine merchant's recommendations. After researching some fantastically priced wines on the FinestWine.com website, I took my list to my local store and was sorely disappointed. Since none of the wines I had researched were available, I needed to start at square one and did not have a square one to jump on.  This book provided one.  It tutored me regarding label so that I could get more grape and taste for my buck.  By depicting in full color the actual labels produced by the various chateaus along with a succinct description of the producer's quality, yield, climate, soil, grape varieties, styles, longevities, etc, I was able to make some great selections.<br /><br />The book is divided into the different varieties of wine based on region:  Alsace &amp; Lorraine, Bordeaux, Burgundy, etc and is further exemplified by the various appellations and recommendations regarding producers and good vintages.  Each of the ten regions begins with pages about the region with a drivng tour and ends with a discussion of the region's food partnerships and tasting tips.  I would imagine that this would serve well on one of the popular wine tours of France.<br /><br />The book begins with some rudimentary information regarding the process of winemaking, label reading, red and white wine differences, starting a cellar, wine and food . . . it is extremely comprehensive and yet fits well into the 240+ page format --- every page filled with glossy photographs and interesting sidebars.<br /><br />If you enjoy the popular DK city/region/country travel books, you will equally enjoy this.

As all activities revolve around the wedding of their friend Manolis' daughter to the son of a wealthy hotel owner and entrepreneur,  the authors can expertly relay to the reader the customs and traditions of the Greek-American community while paving the way for a delightfully non-stop romp of intrigue.  The narrator, Julia, speaks from the heart; her unfamiliarity with the Greek-American world makes her the perfect guide for the non-Greek American reader to become acquainted along with her to this culture's warmth and wealth of tradition.  Most amusing is her handling of the sensual Rula, who vies for Nick's attention with her sexy dancing expertise.  Father Charles' rather unfortunate reaction to his favorite cigars ranks highly on the fun meter also.  My one complaint would be the lack of allowing the narrator some musing time where the new information is weighed with the old and analyzed for alternatives.  The action in this story is relentless and perhaps needs a little settling time between steps to allow the reader to come up with theories of his/her own.  Otherwise, it is a colorful portrayal of the Greek-American world--one I heartily recommend.  I look forward to reading the Iakovou's other two Nick and Julia mysteries.	2003-01-05

Perricone's advise is not as complicated as it seems when laid out in an a more concise fashion which you can see on his web site.  He prescribes a high content of the Omega-3 fish oils that are found in fish like salmon--the wilder the better, fruits containing vitamin A and C like fresh berries and plenty of green vegetables in lieu of starchy carbohydrates like the usual high-carb suspects on the dietary hit-list--potatoes, bread and rice.  All of this makes perfect sense and all has been commented on before by thousands of health experts and diet gurus for the last ten years, but never strung together with scientific data to back up its basic premise----following the plan as simplistically as possible---eating a portion of salmon (the size of your palm), fresh fruit, lentils and green vegetables with olive oil sans butter will lavish your skin with all the things it needs to simply glow with good health.  Think of it as fertilizing your garden with the nutriments it needs and having it grows large and pretty flowers.<br /><br />In addition to eating well, Perricone explains and recommends the type of supplements your skin needs to blossom with the same simplicity a garden expert is going to recommend the soil content necessary to ensure a proper yield of flowers or fruit. The four Perricone particularly touts are: Vitamin C, Alpha Lipoic Acid, DMAE and Vitamin E---these in addition to the fish oil attained by eating wild salmon.  Two of the popular vitamin manufacturers now package Vitamin C, Alpha Lipoic Acid and DMAE in one capsule taken once or twice a day, making taking the supplements as easy as you could wish.<br /><br />As for the Perricone products--they really are great.  I have tried the eye solutions, the lifts, the finishing cream, the cleanser, and the lip plumper.  The only complaint I have is with the lip plumper---this seemed to dry my lips rather than smooth them out---if you are reading, Dr. Perricone, help me out here.  I would like to try one of the night time creams, but quite frankly, the $120 price tag puts me off :-) The web site explains quickly what products you need for your basic skin type.<br /><br />I think Dr. Perricone's analytical approach gets results and makes sense.  You would not feed your garden flowers a solution of toxic waste simply because you were too lazy---and still expect a healthy yield.  So why expect the opposite for your skin?  If you feed it junk--its going to look like junk.<br /><br />I have subtracted a star because at times the good doctor seems to be merely touting his products rather than the method--although he tells you what ingredients to look for on the labels--unfortunately not many companies make what he is prescribing.

As I have seen the film of the same name many times, I already understood the gruesome goal that piqued Jame Gumb's mind as he killed each of his victims and earned the name 'Buffalo Bill'.  However, being aware of the murderer's intentions did not detract from the overall reading, rather it allowed me the freedom to analyze Harris' work from a craftsman's perspective and pay closer attention to the baited hints Hannibal Lector tosses to Clarice Starling akin to bits of bread flicked to greedy birds. These scenes between Lector and Starling are electrifying in their simplicity and nuanced with a psychological tension so taut it leaves the reader gritting his teeth and sucking in his breath. Harris' juxtaposition of Lector's insidious disregard for anything that barricades his way, with his refined tastes and superior brain powers creates a personality that evokes a fascinating blend of revulsion and admiration.  Like Starling, we are titillated and repulsed--little flies in Lector's spiderweb.<br /><br />The film covers the novel's ground to near perfection, so anyone who has seen and enjoyed the film knows what to expect.  Crawford's character in the book is fleshed out with a little more detail regarding his personal life.  Such details plunge the reader deeper into the dark world of criminal investigation where sleepless nights and stark conditions supercede any of the press-generated glory from a real time quality-of-life standpoint.	2002-12-19

Of course, as with the other Zen installmenets, murder and mayham pursue him, even as he sits idle, in mid-flirtation with Gemma, the saucy potentially new lady in his life.<br /><br />Fans of Zen's will be thrilled that he has weathered the storm of the previous novel and uses this one to pull himself physically and mentally back together.<br /><br />Dibdin's portrayal of the Italian resort town is pricelessly on-the-money amusing.  His detour to Iceland with its Clousseau undertones would probably be a lot funnier on film.  Best of all, prepare yourself for an extremely absurd end scene where Gemma, whose cynic approach to life is even more down to the nitty-gritty than his own, proves to have as amoral a mind as his.<br /><br />The story barely stretches to 200 pages and is more farce than the other novels except perhaps for 'Cosi Fan Tutti'.  Likewise, the mystery is comparably slim when matched against \\"A Long Finish\\" or \\"Dead Lagoon\\" Instead, the concentration focuses on Zen's reawakening into the world rather than the intrigues of a criminal mastermind. Nevertheless the whole experience comes across as bright and funny and should segue into an even more delightful new installment with the worldly designer-clad Gemma as sidekick.	2002-12-14

While the adventure excites and the romance titillates, Du Maurier manages, quite subtly to explore the timeless themes of true freedom versus responsibility and the changing nature of love from its first incendiary spark to the mellow flame of comfortable love of long-time partners.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip Du Maurier's first chapter---don't get discouraged by it, it is merely a ploy used by the author to suggest the timeless quality of love that lingers off the coast of Cornwall even to the modern day---read this chapter over again after you finish the book and it will lose its old fashioned storyteller's introduction and emit the haunting ghostlike ambiance it was meant to suggest.<br /><br />Rather than look at this as the tale of an adultress as one of the other reviewers strongly points out, imagine Dona as confused, not yet content enough to live out her days with Harry, the children and the dogs until she has found her own identity and come to terms with who and what she is.<br /><br />I imagine Du Maurier herself, having such questions whirl around in her own mind as she spun her tales at Menabilly--basically alone in the country while her husband was at war. The adventure of Dona St. Columb speaks of Du Maurier's own sense of restlessness and universally allows all of us to freely associate and commiserate.  All of the Du Maurier heroines are trapped in worlds where they are dependent on their strong males counterparts.  Du Maurier's portrayals suggest her view of woman's vantage point a dismal one---woman acquiesce; they only find a life when they do.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story of a young wife who transforms from child to woman in less than 300 pages.  She becomes a boy to experience the ultimate freedom that she will never have as a woman.  At the end she must return to her her trap, content or discontent to know her place as a woman. I have read 'Frenchman's Creek' and listened to it at least ten times, always taking from it something new as my own life develops. Highly recommended as a real classic romance.She becomes a boy to experience the ultimate freedom that she will never have as a woman.

Dr.Perricone's book--bless him--is the first to present a diet plan for people with my skin type--and it works!<br /><br />On a more general level, the book features other diets for other skin types and ethnicities.  While I can only speak for myself and my own specific needs, I would imagine that his suggestions stand as correct for he seemed to know exactly what my skin needed in terms of nourishment.  Yes, his diet does strictly adhere to 'Zone-like' principles--but so what?  It works in terms of better looking skin and in over all good health.  Another fantastic bonus benefit?  Weight loss.<br /><br />If you can afford them--check out his products.  I was lucky enough to receive a few of them last Christmas--and they are wonderful.  I was using a popular Shea Butter face cream prior to trying the Perricone grouping, and this was causing black heads and oil build-up.  Not so with Dr. Perricone's products.  They glide on and offer protection in both dry and cold weather.  Along with his food guidelines, they are promoted at the famous Camelback Spa in Phoenix Arizona---used in their facial treatments.  As for the supplements, you don't have to buy his--the basic three are packaged in a similar health food supplement blend that you can buy cheaply in your health food store.<br />His ideas make good sense and contrary to the comments of another reviewer, I think his face looks pretty darn good.  Lines in your face also reflect your personality---they aren't synonomous with poor diet or skin care.  If you are after a blank page look with absolutely no expression,never mind the diet or the supplements, go to your dermatologist for Botox injections.<br />I deducted a star for some of Perricone's obviously self-serving rhetoric.self-serving rhetoric.	2002-12-06
US	53093124	R1AG8WIWHLI3AJ	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Hannibal's Story Continues	It seems that many people did not like this book, but after listening to the unabridged performance on audio cassette, I found the story compelling and psychologically intriguing, once you cut through the campy melodrama.  Grant you, some of the characters, in particular, the hideously incapacitated Mason Verger, are portrayed as one-dimensional over-the-top drones on a mission that simply drive the story's action rather than provide psychological intrigue.  Clarice who in 'Silence of the Lambs' was both intrigued and repelled by Lector now seems more reticent regarding him, yet remains intent on capturing him alive before he strikes again.  However, her fate, albeit befuddled, befits her portrayal in this storyline.  The Italian police inspector, Pazzi, proves to be an adequate fly caught within Lector's web of mindgames; Harris' well-researched information regarding the Florence of Dr. Fell's world interests the reader enough to pursue Lector's penchants for the world's finer things with outside resources.<br /><br />Above all, one cannot help but like Hannibal Lector. Harris' disclosure regarding an episode in his childhood gives some indication of why he chose his rather (un)savory road, but remains mysterious enough to stimulate thought regarding this rather than providing definitive answers regarding all his motivations.  His passion for good music, books, 'food' and wine, amusingly calls to mind the traits of some of my more ambitious friends; his anger with those who offend and downtrod the innocent can be thought questionably admirable rather than strictly abhorent.<br /><br />The characters of Barney from 'Silence of the Lambs' and Margot, Mason's sister and one-time patient of Lector are examples of  Harris' more complicated studies; both are interesting and enjoyable characterizations.<br /><br />When reading this, try not to think solely of the movie, although I found this difficult to do.  Instead concentrate on how wonderfully Harris fits all his pieces together to form a puzzle that is more than a satisfying read.her to form a puzzle that is more than a satisfying read.	2002-12-06
US	53093124	R3K74SEZ8CVLTC	0060394455	325593509	The Family: A Novel	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Disjointed Tale of Borgia Family	In Ms Gino's afterward, she tells us that Mario Puzo toyed with writing a novel about the Borgia's for over 20 years.  Unfortunately he completed many of the novel's vignettes, but he failed to pull them all together with a central theme or motiff that would have made the story as fantastically memorable as it should have been.<br /><br />In keeping with Puzo's fascination with the Mafia, the Borgias are packaged and marketed as the first 'crime' family.  Indeed, their exploits, motivated by the desire to unite the Papal States during the early 1500s, call to mind the savage deeds sanctioned by the Cosa Nostra---all in the name of family.  However only parts of this novel really sparkle with Puzo's usual sitting-round-the-table storytelling technique.  Only portions of the story are told in any great detail--I got the feeling that Puzo dug into these portions with great interest, but sadly never had the time to pull the entire thing together to make it more a solid work rather than a series of incidents tied together to form a novel fit for publication.<br /><br />If the forbidden love between Lucretzia and Cesare was such a motivatior in the participants' lives, it should have been a more important motiff that made sense of some of the character's actions.  We are told over and over again that Pope Alexander, as head of the family, was a man of many sensual appetites, but there should have been more concrete detailed examples of this. What in reality was probably audacious and unbelievably flamboyant becomes reduced to a flatness I don't think the author intended.<br /><br />I think what could have been an exciting novel about some of history's most wicked scoundrels--Cesare Borgia was said to be the model for Macchiavelli's 'the Prince'--- simply was not finished in time.  The author never had the chance to piece the story together in the way that would have made a bigger impact.  A real shame.	2002-12-05

I kept comparing Zen to the Pazzi character in the Thomas Harris novel 'Hannibal'--while his intentions were good, whatever he did virtually amounted to nothing as powers greater than his were at work to sabotage his frail efforts.<br /><br />This installment is not that difficult to follow, again I recommend reading the books in order so that the full impact of Zen's mental state is appreciated.<br /><br />Recommended only because it is part of the series.	2002-12-04

To top it off, he finds that after his headlining success in exposing the menacing presence behind the 'Clean Streets' campaiagn in Naples, he is to be shuffled down to Sicily as part of a new Anti-Mafia squad. Only the influence of a rich film director who after hearing of the murder of his favorite vintner cannot bear the thought of the famous wine not being produced that year simply because the only man who can accomplish this feat is being held for his father's murder.  Zen's task then takes him to Asti in the Piedmont where as he attempts to accomplish his assignment--the release of the vintner's son--he stumbles upon a sequence of murders with roots in the past which he must ferret out with the tenacity of the region's truffle dogs. As usual Zen's methods are not always ethical; his determination to get the job done does not always insure that the guilty person is punished by the proper channels--although serendipitiously Zen manages to justify his means with a noble ending.  Nevertheless, his exploits in this installment are so far the most satisfying of the series.  Zen's sonambulism in the beginning of the novel emphasizes his distraught over the goings-on in Naples--think Al Pacino sleeplessly squinting in 'Insomnia'---which are compounded by equally stressful information imparted by a mysterious young lady.  Dibdin's portrayal of Mignot, one of the truffle hunters, utterly stuns with a skin-crawling realism.  Dibdin expertly mixes a lethal cocktail of greed and madness to create a wonderful melange of men whose livings thrive on the bounty of the earth, one way or another.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-22

Unwilling to wait calmly for the bottom to fall out, Zen hides himself in Naples as head of the harbor police. What follows entertains well; as Zen is well adapted to the under-the-table corruptness of Italy's bureaucracy, the openly criminal aspects of Naples imbues him with a relieved wrinkle-free lightness.  Dibdin's portrayal of Naples infects the reader with a vibrancy that could only be qualified as operatic for indeed, he uses Mozart's opera as an outline for this foray replete with colorful, passionate characters: thieves, gangsters, prostitues, lovers, Zen's formidable mother and present/ex-girlfriends.  The tone shines with a freshness that is missing from the first four works of the series, leading me to recommend that the books be read in sequence so that this one is fully appreciated.	2002-11-18

The week in the life of British historian and lecturer, John, posing as Jean, the impoverished Comte of the chateau de Gue is a journey of the mythic hero, going off into unknown territory and accomplishing a mission where he is thereby transformed. Before the switch, John feels like a voyeur, reading and studying people from a distance rather than actually living in the midst of them. Once he is immersed in Jean's life, he cannot help but feel---as the comte, every decision he makes, effects numerous lives. Like other Du Maurier male characters, John finds as a male he holds the power; the woman flutter about him, allowing and acquiesing to his indisputed control.  John believes he becomes a newer,better version of Jean as he interacts with Jean's mother, sister, wife, brother and wife; what he doesn't realize is that in enacting this transformation he can never go back to the life he once knew;his newfound strength sacrifices the 'scapegoat' of the title; with this death, the chateau and its remaining personel are revitalized with a new life.<br /><br />Du Maurier's undertaking of having John speak in a first person narrative succeeds on every level. The reader experiences all the surprises and revelations through John's eyes and tender heart. Her portrayal of Marie-Noel, Jean's eleven year old daughter, borders on genius; the character springs off the pages, a concatenation of cartwheeling free spirit and religious waif, confused by the seemingly nonsensical activities of the adults around her.<br /><br />Du Maurier masterfully illustrates the old adage 'there are two sides to every story' throughout the novel as well-meaning John's actions loose something as they are translated by the other dwellers in the Chateau and by Jean himself. Throughout the book, I wondered if Du Maurier, like Jean was playing an elaborate joke on the reader as well---could Jean and John be the same person? On a whim, Jean pretending to be a stranger, conveniently forgets the past and initiates changes that he otherwise could not consciously facilitate? Interesting.<br /><br />Obviously, the novel is highly recommended to all., Jean pretending to be a stranger, conveniently forgets the past and initiates changes that he otherwise could not consciously facilitate?

Zen's dreams include moving away from the detestable Rome and installing himself with his mother and girlfriend Tania into a the Zen villa off the Cannaregio canal.  His fantasy lacks substance only because the money he has isn't nearly what he needs to refurbish the decaying house.  With his hachet-sharp mind, Zen figures out a way to subsidize his scanty paycheck; he will discover the whereabouts, alive or dead, of a wealthy missing American whose family is willing to pay him plenty to end the legal quagmire his estate is in.  In order to stay in Venice in an offical capacity, he attaches himself to a seemingly simple case involving one of his mother's acquaintances, a batty old countess who swears she is being terrorized by intruders in her own stately palazzo. But, Aurelio's best laid machinations fall, so-to-speak, in the black wells known as the pozzi neri or septic tanks over which all the houses of Venice are built. As Zen attempts to solve his investigative puzzles and family problems with his best intentions, he is sidetracked by meeting old friends, one of which is immersed in a political movement meant to eventually restore Venice to it former strategic position as a great trading nation---the other the attractive wife of the movement's leader.  With the addition of these new factors, Zen's intital dreams shift and change like the waters in the canals.<br /><br />Being lucky enough to have visited Venice myself, I found Dibdin's audio, visual and olifactory portrait of the city remarkable. The labyrinth of small bridges, canals and walkways are expertly rendered and a joy to read.  As always with this series, Zen's ability to bend the law to his own advantage and pull in favors embues the novel with a gritty realism.  His thoughts of his mother, his girlfriends, past and present are priceless, adding just the right comedic touch to lighten his otherwise cynical existence.ghten his otherwise cynical existence.	2002-11-15

Some built-in human chemistry allows this kind of story to excite us, no matter how many times we have heard it.  The elements are all familiar, but unless you've read Campbell or taken a course on the mythical hero, you have not put all the elements together in a format that is easy to understand and utilize. Frey does just that.<br /> Frey looks at the power of myth and creates a template that will help any level writer create a journey of transition.  He employs various examples to back up his premise and analysis and relies heavily on outlines discussed in his two previous \\"Damn Good\\" how-tos.  (I don't have either of the other works and I was able to make perfect sense of Frey's suggestions.)  Frey's analysis provides fledgling writers such as myself a way in which to formulate a concrete foundation before actually attempting to delve into the literary process that entails the use of distinctive language.  I am hoping that in employing his tips I will avoid my usual sandtraps---adding too many scenes simply because I enjoy placing my fictional creations in situations that have little to do with the message of my book.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I believe Frey's ideas wonderfully readable and easily employable.  He suggests fleshing out each character by defining him/her physiologially, sociologically and pyschologically and then writing a journal in the character's voice to better facilitate 'stepping into that character's shoes.'  Along with this he defines certain qualities that are de rigueur for a mythic hero and for the hero's nemesis, \\"the Evil One.'  Other secondary characters are explored along the way, as Frey explains the different stages the mythic hero lives through in order to accomplish his mission and transform himself in the process.<br /><br />The Flaw:  While every one of Mr Frey's suggestions make sense,I believe that without some real intuitive writing---and Frey does warn of this--- the outcome,if one merely follows his formula would be just that---formula.  Frey uses examples that run the gamut of the literary spectrum--i.e. Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" to Grisham's \\"The Firm\\"--he illustrates how the mythic hero template fits over each of his examples--- but I don't want to write a novel that simply bestsells as in the Grisham case, I want my work to actually mean something.  His example, \\"The Blue Light\\", detracts from the otherwise great advise that the book offers.  'The Blue Light', is typical of the sensationalized writing that unfortunately seems to sell.  Okay,its just an example and just a first draft, but the characters are trite, in particular the macho woman armed with itching powder, fearless and unwilling to do just about anything to get her story--blah,blah,blah---any mass media paperback that you pick up at the drugstore contains the same type of character---so why do I want to write a 'movie-of-the-week' wannabe that pretty much everyone else and his brother are writing?<br /><br />Nevetheless, I enjoyed reading 'The Key'; I found my mind spinning with ideas on how to fix something I am working on and at the same time tighten all the loose ends that would otherwise destroy the essential ideas.  The format is fun and easy to read --Frey does not teach you how to write--he helps outlines a structure that if applied is sure to help your story become a personal success.accomplish his mission and transform himself in the process.<BR><BR>The Flaw:  While every one of Mr Frey's suggestions make sense,I believe that without some real intuitive writing---and Frey does warn of this--- the outcome,if one merely follows his formula would be just that---formula.

With the tenacity of a pit bull,  Zen slowly but surely cuts though the red tape dealings between the separate bureaucracies of the Vatican and Italy, and dodges encounters with the carbaniari, as he lies his way through the riot of events that follow his compliance with the Vatican to allow the Prince's death to be recorded as a suicide. When he unearths the existence of the \\"Cabal\\", a secret organization within the Knights of Malta, the snowball of information Zen has gathered begins an enjoyably fast and by no means boring descent into the world of computer hackers, would-be informants encountered during a high-speed train ride and a strange brother and sister duo ensconced in an old and decaying family house in fashionable Milan.<br /><br />As in the first two Zen novels, Aurelio's gritty acceptance of his world's self-absorbed machinations entitles him to use some less than admirable avenues of manipulation to get to the truth and at the same time make life more comfortable for Zen.  The most delightful portions of this installment explores the undercurrent of vulnerabity Zen experiences when he uncovers secret organizations within his own existence--- his mother's world no longer revolves around him, and Tania, busily promoting a mail-order gourmet food business, may be two-timing him.  I look forward to Zen's further 'adventures' with his women and compliated life in the Eternal City.	2002-11-08

For sure, this novel, set on Mykonos, Tinos and Athens is definitely a page turner of the first degree--it kept my interest from start to finish.<br />However, please do not expect a great novel of espionage or psychological suspense of the Robert Ludlum, Thomas Harris or Mary Higgins Clark genre.  Instead, enjoy the somewhat nefarious exploits of Garth Hanson, a down-on-his-luck artist/art dealer/foil champion with a healthy grain of salt.  Hanson accepts the proposition of a blackmailer to fly to the Greek Island of Tinos to observe and copy a famous ikon revered for its healing properties.  As Hanson has been a frequent guest of famed Greek hospitality, living on and off on the island of Mykonos, he gladly takes on this bit of dubious employment and exuberantly rejoins his hard-drinking womanizing Irish friend and fellow schemer, Eugene.  The wild side of Mykonos is adequately framed by author Van Haas, he describes the night club scenes with enough realism to recapture moments of my own stay on the island.  The action of his characters move the story along at a fast pace which leaves little to be desired regarding any character development.  The reader gets the sense that Hanson has experienced some deep religious breach, but, it is not adequately persued by the author.  It matters naught, I don't think this novel was meant to answer any of the age old questions pondered by philosophers.  Its meant to entertain, and that's what it does.  There are plenty of leggy women, drinking bouts, sex scenes, and adventurous brawling to satisfy anyone just looking for a few hours of escape.  Unfortunately one of the biggest problems I had with this novel was the bad translation and editing. The switch in tenses is confusing as are the frequent mispellings.  I was also disappointed that the author never persued Hanson's fencing abilities later on during the action sequences.  Why go through the desription of the beginning match if such adroit skills are left behind in California?  Go figure.later on during the action sequences.

Firstly, we glimpse the case of the brutal murder of Oscar Burolo and his guests in his supposed-fortress-like luxury complex on the Italian island of Sardinia.  Then, we are again made painfully aware of the infernally clogged(but precisely groomed and clothed) machinery of the Italian bureaucracy with its syncophants, favor mongers, payoffs, good old boy's club and nefarious double dealings with the less-than-desirable underworld.  We realize that wealthy and powerful higher-ups in the Italian Ministry have a vendetta of their own---they hotly desire Burolo's murder avenged as Burolo's corrupt dealings lined their purses with the an ever-pleasant flow of cash.  Dissatisfied with the currently held murder suspect,and pleased with little-known Zen's written conclusion that exonerates the said suspect, the Italian Ministry moves Zen to Sardinia to drum up a case against ANYONE who will fit the scapegoat bill. Before he leaves, Zen encounters yet another vendetta, one that may be directed solely at himself. Perturbed, but not scathed, Zen ferries off to the island in what he thinks is a sufficient undercover disguise. When he bungles his dealings with police-shy locals,he finds himself stalked by a killer who serendipidiously aids him in discovering the real murderer as he runs for his life over Sardinia's bleak interior. The luck that held for him in \\"Ratking\\" sticks with him during this foray; he returns to Rome in disheveled glory.<br />As in the first Zen mystery, the actual crime and its solution act as a compelling backdrop and springboard to Zen's real problems.  In this case, his mother, his love life and his inability to fare well in the midst of the male society of the Criminalpol provide ample insight to an already enjoyable character of immense depth.  The settings of Rome and Sardinia add glamour to the well-heeled image-conscious Italian populace which Dibdin allows us to view through Zen's accomplished and somewhat jaded eyes as he further immerses himself within the complex inner workings of Italian law enforcement.<br />Even thoughI read 'Cabal' and 'Dead Lagoon' before reading 'Ratking' and 'Vendetta', I would recommend reading the books in sequence so that the entire panorama of Zen's difficult life is laid out in front of you as it is intended. Zen's motivation become more understandable.  When reading the books out of sequence,the reader has little information about Zen on which to fall back on and there is nothing but the mystery itself to fully engage the reader.

Stewart requires indepth reading, her plots are intricate, her characterizations strong. She is incomparable; her words are literature. Although descriptions abound, there is not any graphically detailed sex, so if this is not your cup of tea, read no further and look for another selection.<br />This particular book does not fit into any of the usual Stewart categories----the great chase as in 'Madam Will You Talk?', the closed room police procedural as in 'Wildfire at Midnight' or the Evil Relative with Nefarious Intentions as in 'Nine Coaches Waiting'----rather, it is a story of impersonation. . . and one of Stewart's best offerings in terms of just about everything: plot, tone, description, dialogue, characterization etc.<br />Mary Grey accepts a 'job',posing as Annabel Winslow, the long-lost cousin and heiress to Whitescar, a lucrative North England working farm---her employer, her 'cousin' Con has much to gain once Annabel's cantankerous old grandfather passes on.  At first, after careful schooling by Con and his half-sister, Lisa, Mary takes to her new position smoothly, easily edging her way into life on the farm with a barrage of lies that seem to be second nature to her.  No one doubts her identity until she discovers the presence of an unknown lover that may blow her cover.  The real reason Annabel Winslow left Whitescar eight years earlier hits the reader with tour de force revelation which Stewart masterfully manipulates.<br />I won't spoil the story any further.  It must be read slowly and savored like a good $100+ bottle of wine.  The language is glorious,meant to be read aloud.  The words paint wonderfully lush and powerful images of life in the north country.  The characters likewise are finely drawn, flesh and blood human beings whose emotions thunder off the pages with the same potent electric charge of lightning that finally splits the old ivy tree in two towards the end of the story.  Even the secondary characters are not to be missed.  Mrs. Bates with her nosy northerner's distrust of anything 'London', Julie, the pettish young adult who is Annabel's mirror image, and Donald Seton, the stuffy, but warm-hearted Scot archaeologist with a soft spot for the greedy cat Tommy and his litter of kittens.  Even the colt, Rowan, has a personality all his own; Stewart knows and loves her animals and this like all her other novels is a tribute to the creatures and places she loves best.<br />I have read and listened to this book over and over again.  Each time, even though I know the ending, I find new techniques to ponder and wonder over.  Stewart is simply fantastic; shame on anyone who prefers lesser works to her masterpieces.ent electric charge of lightning that finally splits the old ivy tree in two towards the end of the story.

US	53093124	R11FGNMJ4QNHH1	0385486472	772238442	When in Rome: A Journal of Life in Vatican City	Books	4	10	13	N	Y	Fun and Factual	Upon the advise of a good tour guide, I purchased this book after visiting and utterly enjoying the Eternal City. Please note that this is certainly not the ultimate guide to the Vatican or to understanding Catholicism.  It is merely a collection of the amusing anecdotes of a journalist, who like other journalists has the opportunity to live in another part of the world and then comment about his impressions of adapting or accepting another culture.<br />In this instance, Hutchinson moves to Rome with the sole purpose of writing a &quot;what I did on my summer vacation&quot; book on the Vatican.  He and his wife and three children, all practising Catholics already feel that affinity to Rome, the Pope and the Vatican that all Catholics innately experience.  Here, Hutchinson explores with pure delight his connection with an institution that has lasted through 2000 years of tumultuous change and yet like the rock it was built upon, invariably stays the same.<br />Hutchinson's Roman adventures are sprinkled liberally with his slightly irreverant humor and yes, as other reviewers have commented, he does repeat himself.  But instead of looking cynically upon these faux pas, think of Hutchinson as the prodigal son (or any other excited tourist with a film projector filled with slides) returning from the unknown and merely so thrilled by what he has seen and experienced, can barely contain himself.  Enjoy his exuberance, visit Rome and share in it.<br />Although most entertaining for me were Hutchinson's stories about St. Peter's bones, the Borgia popes, and the holy relics, I found the entire book one refreshing breeze of a read that brought back for me the sound of the Vespas in a city that juxtaposes the old with the new in a very stylish and sophisticated way.  Recommended reading for AFTER that trip to Rome---to relish all those &quot;Roman&quot; sensations all over again.	2002-10-17
US	53093124	R1HCNHC1GRY4A1	0708992900	668690754	Whispers In The Sand (CH) (Charnwood Library)	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Supernatural Stalkings	Barbara Erskine re-explores her favorite themes of obsession, romance, and the supernatural in this 500+-page novel told against the exotic backdrop of the lush banks of the Nile and the fascinating monuments of Egypt's ancient kings.<br />In 1866, famous artist Louisa Shelley, newly widowed, cruises down from Luxor to Ashram. She recounts her travel adventures through her paintings/sketches and in her diary. In particular she revels in the telling of a newfound love and his love token of an ancient scent bottle.<br />Now in modern times, Louisa's great-great-granddaughter, Anna, at odds with her own life, returns to the scene of her ancestor's adventure, bringing the diary and the now antique scent bottle back to Egypt where their return initiates a chain of events which threaten Anna's very life. Feelings of greed, obsession,and jealousy stir amongst the passengers on-board Anna's cruise, but the main force unleashed whirls from the hub of the scent bottle, the contents of which is protected by two malevolent priests who drain the lifeforce of all those who come within the bottle's sphere of influence.<br />This particular foray into the supernatural is written very much in the more hurried style Ms Erskine employs in \\"On The Edge of Darkness\\". The characters are not as finely drawn as in her earlier successes, \\"Lady of Hay\\" and \\"Child of the Phoenix\\", nor does it contain the mind-chilling fear generated so frightfully well in \\"House of Echoes\\". Here, the frenetic state of the modern-day cruise passengers due from \\"exposure\\" to the priests and the bottle seems trite and a little too indignant to be considered realistic. There is a lot of angry repetitive conversation and a lot of toe-treading right from the start which in a normal holiday environment would not exist and could only be thought of as contrived by the author to suggest the dark behind-the-scenes workings of the priests. Even so, the events flow quickly and remain somewhat interesting due to the technique of interspercing Louisa's diary entries---by far the more compelling of the two parallel tales--- with corresponding moments during Anna's tour. One final problem---As the story runs on, accruing one catastrophe after another, it dies abruptly with no apparent ending or resolution other than an afterward by the author where we are told that we, like the characters, must acknowledge the priests' evil and decide that some form of semi-unification amongst the book's persona will eventually and successfully combat it. While this ending may seem \\"real\\", it is nonetheless not a satisfacatory literary ending. The priests may or may not be subdued, nothing is rectified concretely and consequently,the reader feels taken for a 500+ page ride with an appropriate destination in sight, but, alas, disappointingly never quite reaches the goal. Nevertheless, I still recommend it as Ms Erskine's niche of combining the supernatural with the everyday has otherwise not been filled.<br />Hopefully, Ms Erskine's next endeavor will render a more satisfactory conclusion and rekindle that fresh interest in the unknown/occult that her earlier works evoke.nique of interspercing Louisa's diary entries---by far the more compelling of the two parallel tales--- with corresponding moments during Anna's tour.

Byatt,'Touch Not the Cat'(written in 1975)  combines a literary mystery with excerpts from the past, poetry, Shakespeare, history and the gift of mind transferrence to deliver a wonderfully fulfilling tale that is a joy to read.<br />Stewart employs her usual fantastic sense of place in describing Ashley estate and its environs down to the last daffodil. It is her main character, narrator Byrony Ashley who is both possessed and possessor. From childhood, she and an unknown Ashley cousin have had the ability to communicate with their minds at great length, at great distances. Byrony's need to know the identity of this mind interloper/lover drives most of the novel's plot.  As in the Byatt book, 'Touch Not the Cat' employs different levels to tell the story of parallel lovers, past and present; as we discover the state of affairs between the two Victorian lovers, we are illumined as to how it helps Byrony identify her soulmate and simultaneously solve a present mystery involving the state of the Ashley property after Byrony's father is killed in an automobile accident.<br />Stewart cleverly uses Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet to facilitate the present day lovers' evolving discoveries involving themselves, the estate and the past. Her effervascent interplay and dialogue between the two main characters borders on perfect; her portayal of love's discovery and fulfillment causes the reader to nod and laugh with satisfaction.  The tantillizing aspects of ESP add just the right degree of the supernatural to a well-constructed tale that has just about everything else.<br />Stewart fans will be thrilled that this particular heroine not only gets her man, but allows the reader to be privy to their marital bliss.<br />Recommended highly especially in audio book form read delightfully by Davina Porter.	2002-10-14

For years he has studied and reported on different religions, yet he skeptically remains an agnostic.  When his wife, Felicia becomes an Orthodox Christian, sparks are lit within him to at least intelligently inquire about this tradition that has set his wife on spiritual fire.<br />The couple ends up on Patmos, a Greek Isle of the Dodecannese grouping, the island where John the Evangelist wrote his famous gospel and had his frightening visions which led to the prophesies in the Book of Revelations. Through his wife, France becomes aquainted with nuns and priests of Orthodox Christianity who patiently recognize his need and are happily willing to help nudge him subtly on his journey.<br />For this is what France discovers while he and his wife plod through the normal (and not so normal) procedures necessary to move their lives from England to Greece---that spirituality is a journey--not an arrival.  Religion opens a portal that will lead to greater understanding and oneness with the infinite.  It is this 'Revelation' that brings the beginning of peace to Peter France's life.<br />The procedural part of the narrative--the complicated 'purchase' of their home, their frustrating difficulties with the electricity, the comprehension of what time means in terms of promised appointments by workmen, their decision to move out of town and into an isolated farmhouse and their subsequent battle with the field animals and vermin that ruled there in the absence of human beings are all charmingly told and woven with tales of the island's history and France's discoveries about Orthodoxy's relevancy to his life.<br />A very pleasant sojourn -- I wish Mr. France tranquility and greater understanding---God willing!	2002-10-10

It basically is for the bachelor who doesn't want to be bothered making anything fancier than an omelette.  Anyone with a family or anyone who has cooked extensively will be appalled by the suggestions in this book.  Honestly, if just sticking to the diet is the primary objective, just eating a simple chicken, tofu, or fish dish with the appropriate amount of green veggies and fruit is more than adequate and ten times more delicious than some of the gruesome combinations in this book.<br />On the positive side, the book's layout is nice, especially the spiral binding which makes for easy reading while using.  Too bad, that after making one too many of the catastrophic taste concoctions, I never used it again.  Also handy are the Zone portion charts in the back of the book, but again these can be printed up in a fun format using the table function in Excel and mounted to the inside door of a cabinet for quick reference.<br />Overall this book is totally irrelevant and a waste of cash.	2002-10-08

If you actually follow the diet without cheating, you will be eating plenty of vegetables and fruits without wreaking havoc on your insulin glucagon balance.  More of the accepted dietary 'experts' are now claiming that this balance is the key to controlling weight gain and loss.<br />The Fish Oil: Sears was touting the use of fish oil--about 9 capsules a day when I started to delve into this diet 4 years ago.  He claimed at that time that a beneficial side effect was that it helped with the constipation caused by eating less grains.  This was not true for me; I found that eating more soy products and legumes was the only way I combatted this problem.  Whether or not his molecular brand of fish oil is better or not, I have no idea. Omega 3 oils in general are good for you, but,  I must wonder,however, if he is not just 'selling' his own product.  Case in point, in his first book, he mentions that 'drinking' one's meal in the form of shakes etc. is absorbed more quickly by the body resulting in increased hormonal inbalance, yet, months later he came out with a series of powdered and pre-mixed canned shakes all sporting the Zone logo and the 30-40-30 ratio.  If this was not beneficial or not as beneficial as a regular meal--why manufacture and promote it? Only one reasonable answer. . .<br />Bottom line:  Sears is his own worst enemy.  Whether or not his ideas are truely beneficial or not, his commercialism cancels out his good intentions. You already know what you need to do by reading the other books, so why buy this one?e:  Sears is his own worst enemy.

Tom's reasoning is both nostalgic and capitalistic: it was on Patmos that he met and wooed his wife and wrote his first novel and it is on Patmos that he will accrue enough cash to see himself financially clear for an entire year. All he needs do is rent 'The Beautiful Helen' Taverna for the four hectic months of the summer season, incorporate his multi-national repetoire of delicious menu entrees to the typical Greek fare and through hard work and determination rack in a sizeable fortune.<br />Unfortunately, Tom overplays his hand with an overindulgence of American optimism.  Amidst a silent, embarrassed chorus of less-than-encouraging island characters, Tom learns what the islanders already know:  Fresh produce, fine recipes and hard work are not the only ingredients needed in maintaining a successful restaurant,a watchful eye is first and foremost when one is dealing with an unscrupulous partner like the taverna's owner, Theologos.<br />Soon, Tom's dreamscape of blue water and Greek light are obliviated by the all consuming operation of the taverna.  As the Beautiful Helen's popularity increases, Tom's clearly drawn time allocations are blurred into a huge block of toil and varicose veins that barely afford him the time to sleep.<br />However throughout the Sisyphian tasks of running the taverna, Stone's writing style remains chatty and enthusiastic.  Happily, in spite of his bouts with jealous friends, thieving partners, and evil-eye removing witches, Tom remains pleasantly breezy, refusing to let his misjudgement dampen his spirits.  Above all, the reader gets the sense that even as he is cast out of his Eden by economic necessity, he is not soured by the presense of the serpent in the garden---his omnipresent need to breath the air of Hellas remains pure and untainted.  His exuberance forces us to understand why he undertook the proposition in the first place while his charitable highlighting of the high points of taverna life rather than his humiliations results in a pleasant true-to-life portrayal of the Greek's resolve in business as seasoned by the resource-isolated island life.<br />One Note:  I was saddened that the author's marriage to 'Danielle' ended in divorce no matter how amicable--his love for her was palpable even through the worst of his ordeal.ins chatty and enthusiastic.

Yikes!<br />Ludicrously, Leduc does it all: hacks into complicated computer firewalls, spelunks the infamous rodent infested sewers of Paris, sucker punches neo-Nazi sympathizers and indulges in a few overnighters with nefarious chance acquaintances. By the time I finished \\"Murder in the Marais\\", I was shocked that Aimee had not confessed to being the sister of Batman, so attune was she in sensing danger, so adept at mysteriously appearing whenever she was needed. Please! How could someone so talented be so boring? I don't remember her spending one moment thinking about her real life or her lack of a real life during the entire 360 pages. After cramming 48 hours of punching, kicking, sleuthing, etc. activities into a 24 hour slot, astonishingly, Aimee does not seem to be burdened by at least one suitcase full of complicated psychological baggage. Instead of the 'seen it all' and 'there ain't no surprises' cynicism of the Aurelio Zen genre, Aimee is fueled with an adrenaline boosting fearlessness which seems abnormal, cartoon-ish and just plain impractical. Her purpose is as one-dimensional as her portrayal--'above all--get the job done', but unfortunately this adds little flesh and blood to her character. The reader never likes or dislikes her---we merely plow through all the comic book happenstance and coincidence until the last page wondering when some empathy and emotion will kick in. For me, it never did.<br />The secondary characters are likewise flat and stereotypical. There is no jolt of electricity that animates them beyond the pages of the book. Even the most controversial players, the actual murderer and an assortment of Jew-hating Third Reicht resurectees appear ho-hum---even their evil deeds do not distinguish them. Rather, we are told they are evil, but it is never really demonstrated in any heinous or different way.<br />The only redeemable assembly in this B-rated melange is the unlikely unit of Sarah, Thierry, and Helmut. The two stars that I award to this book are for the recounting of their doomed relationship and for the potentially poignant exploration of what could have been---only third hand information is offered in the denouement.<br />I recommend this book only to those Francophiles who must read everything with even the faintest French flavor.eicht resurectees appear ho-hum---even their evil deeds do not distinguish them.

Being in the wrong place at the wrong time has resulted in a forgotten desk job in Rome where Venetian Zen stares at a phone that never rings. When he is suddenly summonsed to Perugia in the lush Umbrian countryside and placed as lead inspector in a notable electronics magnate's kidnapping, he gets the sense, as we do, that something other than his immediate involvement in the investigation is at work here.  Nevertheless, Zen does his job and as he gathers his information, we observe Zen's world of family, friends and Italy from Zen's cynical eyes. After playing the scapegoat once, Zen is wary; he has learned his lesson and has learned it well.  Understanding the system as painfully and personally as he has, Zen adapts, manipulates and manages to sever the rat tails of the investigation's ratking while simultaneouly reconnecting himself to the tangle of tails which form the ratking of the Italian Law Enforcement machine.<br />The mystery here, is secondary to Zen's tainted vision of the world. It acts a conduit to expose Zen's feelings about the present and the past.  His mantra, if he has one, could be paraphrased: A man must compromise in order to survive.  Dibdin's humorous portrayals of the Italian populace of Umbria, most notably, the Miletti siblings and the Naopolitan driver, are priceless.  The reader gets a real sense of the city state mentality of Italy, where there are definite prejudices between Northerners and Southerners.  Dibdin's countless behind-the-scenes suggestions of corruption, wire-tapping and self-sustaining acts of betrayal seem too farfetched to be thought solely fictional.<br />The tone of the story is cynical and dark which makes for some tedious reading.  The reader finds himself in his own rat tail tangle of misunderstanding.  Zen, a reluctant realist, must deal with an American girlfriend who does not understand his need to keep the details of his relationship with her a secret from his live-in mother.  He's got some issues with his father that come to light while he ponders the ties between the Miletti patriarch and his children.  Along with the bungled career, there is an ex-wife, an abandoned home in Venice and a lifetime of smaller regrets.

Anyone who likes to use chocolate in their culinary creations, may find the variety of finer qualities of couverture daunting.

Delicious descriptions of sumptious chocolate creations abound.  Have a homemade hot chocolate ready to sip and savor while you read.	2002-09-27
US	53093124	R198QKW7JFIAJJ	0965236420	173656780	Dance of the Ariadnes	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Masterful Blending of Myth and Reality	Sharon Spencer's novel \\"Dance of the Ariadnes\\" tackles the complexities of modern relationships by juxtaposing the lives and desires of two creative women, a Slavic actress, Divna, and a confused American artist, Miranda with the cycle of Greek myths involving Ariadne, Dionysus, Theseus, Phaedra and Hippolytus.  Divna has yet to recover from her tempestuous yet now semi-defunct relationship with ex-husband Gypsy folk singer, Dionysios.  Miranda, living and painting on Korchula, a small island off the coast of Yugoslavia is confused by the emotions and passions generated from a recent love affair with Dionysios whom she does not know by name, but thinks is a primitive islander.<br />The two women who are otherwise strangers, meet in Iraklion near King Minos' fabled labyrintine palace; symbolically they dance together on what they think is the dancing-floor of Minos' daughter, Ariadne, and bond as only two women can.  As dual faces of the mortal woman turned goddess, they unravel and analyze their snaggled feelings regarding Dioynysios.  Simultaneously, they form klews containing the threads of their own existence which enable and enpower them to wind through the Labyrinth of their future lives.<br />Throughout the novel, the women change faces.  Miranda is always Ariadne, at once abandoned by Theseus and thus captivated and immortalized by the god Dionysus (the symphonic and colorful gypsy wedding).<br />Earthy Divna also personifies Ariadne; but it is she who abandons, she who is most generous with her love and understanding of the passions of the others around her. She toys with love; her boy-toys are numerous, yet, she is also imprisoned by Dionysus--she has his children and carries yet another child.  Towards the end of the novel,  she becomes Phaedra, Ariadne's sister and wife of Theseus.  As in the myth, she becomes irrationally enamoured by Gerard--Hippolytus, Theseus son by the Amazon Antiope, but the association has no happy ending,Phaedra/Divna/Ariadne emerges from the experience (an intense water sequence reminiscient of the 'white bull' death of Hippolytus) still carrying her child and her memories.<br />The flow of the novel is quick and light.  The reader senses the passion of both women in the erotic dream, reverie and reality sequences which never bore.  The novel always intrigues and teases; the reader is curious about both women and the man that touches both their lives.  Spenser succeeds admirably in creating a sense of the unknown and mythical that needs not be explained only savored and enjoyed. Would love to discuss this novel with someone who has read some of Spencer's other works or had the privledge of hearing her lecture.s from the experience (an intense water sequence reminiscient of the 'white bull' death of Hippolytus) still carrying her child and her memories.<BR>The flow of the novel is quick and light.

Like Lindsey Davis' Marcus Didius Falco series, it features a wise-guy sleuth who thankfully has the good grace not to think too highly of himself.  Above all, Decius is human and is not above enjoying  a good bout of drinking or a night of carousing in the one of the city's less reputable quarters.  Told in the first person, his comments are snide, meant to amuse and soften the historical aspect of the novel by bringing it into the more modern perspective of current sensibilites regarding universal issues like cult religions, proper behavior or the octopus of the political bureaucracy.<br />In this particular offering, the historical phase of the story is particularly entertaining as it enlightens the reader with regard to the lost city of Alexandria.  Decius is part of an envoy to the city of Alexandria, so we are privy to his first hand encounter of a city built on a grid, newer and  so different from Rome.  As Decius tours, so do we. We visit some of the wonders of the ancient world: the fabled great Library, the temple of the Muses (Museum) and the great Pharos lighthouse.  Amidst this backdrop, Decius entertains with his impressions of the alien Hellenic Egyptians (Berenice, Cleopatra and Ptolemy) and the strange barbarian cults which are housed in foreign temples along Alexandia's wide thoroughfares.  We are enlightened as to his thoughts of the more prominent Romans of his day: Julius Caesar, Crassius, Sulla and their progeny,Sulla's daughter. Fausta and Decius' fiance, Julia Minor, daughter of Lucius Caesar.  When a mathematician from Chios is murdered, Decius plods about like a toga clad Sherlock Holmes--infuriating most of the dignitaries he interviews for the sake of determining the truth.  When another murder occurs and the body is found naked beside Decius in his own bed, it becomes brutally clear that Decius has stumbled upon a much more insidious political plot not meant to eliminate one or two unlucky people, but to undermine Rome's entire influence over Egypt.<br />I read this book without the benefit of reading the first three SPQR novels, so I am ill-equipped to discuss the author's development of his main character and the substories which involve his lesser players.  I can only say that the book was enjoyable as a stand-alone and could only get better with the anticipated knowledge reading the other stories would provide.dious political plot not meant to eliminate one or two unlucky people, but to undermine Rome's entire influence over Egypt.  <BR>I read this book without the benefit of reading the first three SPQR novels, so I am ill-equipped to discuss the author's development of his main character and the substories which involve his lesser players.

US	53093124	R3VNTXV6HS2Q0U	0316789844	35085155	Resistance: A Novel	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Ultimately Depressing	As this is a typical Anita Shreve novel, the reader should not expect a happy ending.  As in her other popular offerings, \\"The Pilot's WIfe\\" and \\"The Weight of Water\\", this well-written book probes to the bone the depth of human emotions stretched to the limit of endurance. The characters are well drawn but painful and desperate.  As in her other novels, the interplay between man and woman is imperfect; this time stunted by circumstance and the inert sense of duty enflamed by the cruel reality of war. Ted and Claire come together briefly with no real connection; their love does not have time to settle and die as the other characters Shreve has focused upon, it sparks like an engine whose wires are wet; its only fruit is flawed.  For the most part this book like other Shreve selections tries to mingle the sweet with the inevitable.  In this case, the sweet---the love affair between the Ted and already married Claire is an almost wordless ballet of emotions.  She, married to older Henri, is a  pragmatic villager. wise enough to not wish a child born during the war.  She goes about her business housing wounded soldiers and helping refugee Jews make their way to France and freedom through Spain in the almost gruff and nonchalant way a normal woman would make dinner or drive her kids to school in the morning.  Perhaps some readers will get the sense that she and Henri do not have a great love and that she is just waiting to be ignited by someone that speaks more readily to her soul.  I did not get this sense.  I felt she loved Ted as a defiance to the stagnation and betrayal surrounding them.  Perhaps Ted felt more.  Nevertheless, the relationship is doomed to be ephemeral in terms of actual history, yet everlasting in its impact on their lives.  Bottom line: the story is engrossing in parts but ultimately disappoints the more romantic reader who hopes against hope that the lovers will somehow be reunited in happiness rather with the stabbing and dour pain of which Shreve allows us to partake like a cyanide pill.<br />The most notable aspect of 'Resistance' for me was a glimpse, real or fictionalized into the mindset of the occupied people who bravely 'resisted' the Germans during WWII.  When asked by Ted, the downed American pilot she is hiding from the Nazis & collaborators, if given a choice between saving a busload of children and a jeep full of American aviators,Claire, immediately selects the American aviators because they are helping to free her country from the German grasp.  Ted is fascinated and a little surprised by her response, but then his definition of war is much different from hers--he is surrounded by death and suffering but not on his home turf.<br />As this is not an escapist romance novel, I would recommend this book only to those who want to get an excellent feel for what war does to real lives and are not expecting a happily-ever-after tale. As Shreve seems intent to deliver a vision of the 'real' with all its warts I must wonder how she pulls herself out of the emotional slump writing such novels must engulf her in.  Although fine-tuned, her vision of modern woman is a Greek tragedy of sorrow and pain; her Pandora's box is devoid of ironic hope.ve allows us to partake like a cyanide pill. <BR>The most notable aspect of 'Resistance' for me was a glimpse, real or fictionalized into the mindset of the occupied people who bravely 'resisted' the Germans during WWII.

Whatever turned them on failed to do the same for me.  I found the story, the characters, and yes, even the culinary secrets to be insipid. Rosa, even in her agony of losing her first love, merely reports what is going on around her--and that is not to say that the author succeeds in portraying her as a woman distraught beyond words--she is simply flat and two-dimensional  I wondered if the novel had been written in another language and then translated badly into English--but alas, no.  The author simply fails to make Rosa a likeable character.  Her frenzy of cooking supposedly meant to obliterate her pain should tantalize the reader with other mesmerizing sensations, but again, this does not occur.  Instead, it translates Rosa into a blood-thirsty butcher that appears about as senseless as a hamster turning mindlessly within the staid boredom of its exercise wheel--no offense to the hamster.  The plot is likewise boring and ridiculous.  Rosa runs away to become a librarian in Palermo where after twenty long and tedious years finally becomes enamoured with an Enlishman with terrible teeth---I kept envisioning Austin Powers loverly yellowed dentures--UGH!  Their so-called erotic love scenes are also meant to titillate, but they are puncuated with descriptions of Rosa's sausagelike physique encased in sausage skin corsets out of which the hero must slice her. Not very sexy.  The grand climax--excuse the pun-involves, inevitably with a Sicilian tale--the NIAF should be notified of this acutely painful stereotyping--the Mafia and sadly, more of Prior's canned peasant activities---most notably Rosa discovering her father may be either a debauched priest or a half-witted farmhand, Rosa finding her mother dead in a lump of kneaded dough and SuperRosa aiding in the delivery of her Siamese twin brothers' prostitute wife's triplet daughters. Phew! The reunification of the two lovers is given no play at all--resulting in a tiny paragraph on the last page where miraculously Rosa as new queen of the country farm is proudly enscounced with her fabulously fattening food, her lackey brothers and finally her own personal court jester.<br />I do not recommend this book AT ALL.  ...  Just don't take 'La Cucina' seriously, the characters and the plot which I suppose the author and her editor thought hysterically off key simply fail to amuse.  I add an extra star for some of the culinary procedures explained throughout the book; they do call to mind the rich smell of garlic sauteeing in a good full-bodied olive oil, but pathetically the book does nothing more.Siamese twin brothers' prostitute wife's triplet daughters.

Lovely, red-haired and seemingly a London jet-setter, she is actually a vulnerable young woman with a sterling set of ethics and lingering loyalties.  Her romantic history, however, is disappointing.  As a younger model, awash with the glow of new-found fame, she meets writer Nicholas Drury, 10 years her senior. Sardonic and handsome, he sweeps her away in a whirlwind courtship that ends in a swift marriage doomed to fail as she believes he only sees her slick model's veneer and not the innocent girl beneath the gloss. Four years later, Gianetta finds herself divorced, still modeling and utterly exhausted by her seemingly sophisticated life. A vacation to the isle of Skye in the Hebrides is recommended by her well-meaning parents.  Especially as she wants to avoid the coronation throngs crowding London in May of 1953, Gianetta quickly accepts their advise. Within days she finds herself at the  small Camas Fhionnaridh Hotel at the foot of the Cuillin where fishing and climbing is the order of the day and the fast pace of London is left far behind her.  Or so she thinks.  Instead of peace and quiet, she is first assaulted by the advent of her ex-husband, then by the fact that all of the company staying in the hotel are actually suspected of being a killer who has murdered a local girl in a bizarre ritualistic way involving the Old Religion's tradition of setting wildfire in honor of the Beltane. In the styple of a classic Agatha Christie drawing room police procedural, Gianetta's values are put to the test as the local police enlist her aid in creating their dragnet and the clues begin to point unerringly towards identifying Nicholas as the unknown murderer.<br />Ever present in this well-written story is Mary Stewart's evident love of nature and her uncanny ability to impose on the reader's mind's eye the majesty of the Scottish Hebrides--the towering mountains, the misty bogs and the glittering lochs.  Her expert juxtaposition of the modern day coronation ceremony with the Highland lore of old is scintillating in that it evokes an intelligent Hitchcockian anticipation and delightfully squeamish dread of what is to come as one turns to the next page. Most of the romance takes place outside the bounds of the novel; the reader must conjur up his/her own imagery of the couples relationship before and after the actual storyline.  For those who liked Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn, I think Wildfire at Midnight will equally enthrall.ion of the modern day coronation ceremony with the Highland lore of old is scintillating in that it evokes an intelligent Hitchcockian anticipation and delightfully squeamish dread of what is to come as one turns to the next page.

Enbittered by the events that took place that year she was nine years old, she hopes against hope that the village will not connect the froggy-faced little girl with the grandmotherly woman she has become. Luck is with her---she purchases the old farm where she once lived and by utilising her mother's mouth watering recipes found in an old scrapbook, she opens a marvelous creperie, popular with both the locals and vacationers alike. When her food is reviewed by a famous culinary critic, her weak nephew and his ambitious wife, also restauranteurs, slither in, questioning her owneship of her mother's scrapbook, desiring its recipes for their own failing big city endeavor. Furious, Framboise refuses, triggering an attack meant to destroy the success of her creperie and simultanoeuly reveal the secret that has shamed and haunted her for her entire life.<br />Ingeniously woven throughout the modern story is Framboise's first person account of her ninth year. Harris' style is fast-paced; her revelations are amply yet masterly metered out to keep the reader thoroughly entranced until the last page. The book is not overly long, yet Harris manages to finely draw her characters: Mirabelle, the migraine suffering mother, Tomas,the sly Black Market manipulator, Paul, the one person in the village that recognizes Framboise, and Framboise hersef, strong and bright, ever the leader, not realizing what her cleverness will orchestrate.<br />I found this novel much more interesting and entertaining than Harris' other popular novel Chocolat; the format seems more complete--the structure more satisfying and the ending neatly tying up all fragments and substories. Like Chocolat, it is a novel meant to be read with a fine glass of red wine and a square of good European dark chocolate. Harris' food descriptions utterly tantalize, her knowledge and love of food is evident in the way in which she allows her characters to safely emote through the food they create when they are unable to facilitate speech or gesture.

The act of 'Possession' within the book's context is certainly not passive but transcends the bound pages and possesses even the reader.  After reading the first 250 pages and having those pages lull and mesmerize me with their utterly beautiful language, the second half of the book moves the reader swiftly as if he/she indeed were caught within the fairy fountain and wonderfully drowning within its swells.<br />I attempted the reading of this book when it first was published in 1990; it seemed so delightfully written for someone like myself in mind.  Mystery, romance, literature, poetry, metaphor, hidden meanings, parallel love stories---what more could I ask for?  Sadly, my first attempt failed; I read perhaps 100 pages and could read no more, having made little sense of what actually was being reported.<br />I saw the Paltrow movie recently and encouraged by the plot projected by the movie as well as the performances of the two actors portraying the 19th century lovers made a second attempt at reading this book. This time I am happy to say I was successful.<br />Briefly and without disclosing the novel's ultimate secrets, the book tells the story of two parallel sets of lovers:  Contemporary Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell and 19th century poet Randolph Henry Ash and poetess Christabel LaMotte.  As an academic researching Randolph Henry Ash, Roland discovers an unfinished love letter of the great poet. Upon further investigation, he finds he believes the letter to have been intended for Christabel LaMotte, another poet of the same time period. This discovery would discount many speculations regarding the poet and his muse and would change the recounting of literary history.  His findings lead him to seek out Maud Bailey, another academic who studies the poetry of LaMotte and has a vague family relation to the poetess.<br />The first half of the book is a little tedious, interspersed with short and epic poems by both fictional authors which unfortunately due to the unknowns not yet reconciled at this early part of the story seem overdone and trivial.  I would suggest rereading these with the help of a fable and phrase dictionary once the entire story is in place.  My own education although good simply falls through the cracks in this arena or I should say that my memory of once-learned folklore and mythology has been usurped sadly by more modern undertakings and could definitely stand a refresher course.  Be that as it may, as the two contemporary academics become 'possessed' by uncovering  the entire truth regarding Ash and LaMotte, the 19th century unfolds with readings of the lovers' letters, Ash's wife's diary, LaMotte's cousin's diary, the poems written during the times shared by the two lovers and a third person narrative supplied by Byatt to further titillate what is not spelled out by the manuscripts.  As the denouement draws closer, Roland and Maud find themselves possessed by each other as well as the past.  This heightening of emotion and awareness drives the reader deeper and deeper into the work devouring Byatt's clever use of different literary styles to delineate the characters from the past until they are full-blooded and breathing creatures rather than stuffy drawing room whose remains one glimpses of in museums. In addition to this is an amusing sub-story of the academic in-fighting between LaMotte and Ash constituents from America and Britain all straining to be the first to make inroads within literary history.  Pay close attention to the descriptive names Byatt gives her characters and relate them to their personality quarks.<br />I found myself reading aloud some of the letters and poems merely to hear the exquisite language aloud and to selfishly luxuriate in its meaning.  I can only imagine by the reading of 'Possession' what it must have been like to assemble the pieces of such a book; my hat is forever off to Ms. Byatt for allowing me the simple pleasure of reading something so well constructed and with such a plethora of meaning.lowing me the simple pleasure of reading something so well constructed and with such a plethora of meaning.	2002-09-10

As members of a well-to-do and filthy rich banking family, both Mansels are a little spoiled and very used to getting their own ways.  Hence, it does not seem out of order or intrusive for them to look up great-aunt Harriet, an eccentric old lady who has shunned life in England while living like a pasha for almost a decade in a palace called Dar Ibrahim in the high Lebanon.  On impulse, Christy goes solo to the palace, meeting an ecletic cast of characters straight out of the Arabian Nights.  Strangest of all is her elderly aunt who has taken the pasha descriptor a little too seriously, dressing in male Arab garb and smoking a hookah.  The backdrop, in true Stewart style, is drop-dead-gorgeous; the palace, its gardens, the prince's divan, the seraglio, the darkened corridors and treasure troves are all perfectly illumined for the reader by the author's rich use of language and a seemingly photogenic memory for even the smallest detail--the baying of the locked hounds as Christy wanders about the crumbling palace is just the thing to raise the hair off the back of any reader's neck, while the heady scents of herbs and flowers act as a profuse intoxicating calmative. Of course, there is a mystery which Christy unwittingly stumbles upon like all the other Stewart heroines.  But, in this case, as well-off Christy is so very different from the working girls of the other novels, she meets mayham with an outraged aplomb which is marvelously comedic especially during the novels more crucial dramatic moments.<br />I listened to the audio version of this book read by Davinia Porter who has read other Stewart novels but somehow manages to get across Christy's spoiled yet kindly dispostion in a fresh style that makes the listener wish the reading would never end. There is romance, again underplayed in Stewart's signature style; as with all her male leads, the hero acts as a buttress to make sense out of Christy's spirited insights.<br />I recommend this whole-heartedly; the language is unsurpassed; the conjuring of the Middle East of the 60s romantic and whimsical.in underplayed in Stewart's signature style; as with all her male leads, the hero acts as a buttress to make sense out of Christy's spirited insights. <BR>I recommend this whole-heartedly; the language is unsurpassed; the conjuring of the Middle East of the 60s romantic and whimsical.	2002-09-05

From his first sip, he is entranced, abandoning all thoughts of his beloved at home and just about everything else as he plunges headlong into a sensuous affair where he discovers the secrets of preparing the world's most delectable chocolate as well as the contours of his lover's body.  As they are about to be separated by the destruction of Montezuma's great city, Diego and Ignacia vow never to love another and drink a special concoction to validate their committment.  Little does Diego realize that the elixir enables him to slow down his aging so that every ten years of his life is likened to 100 years of normal human existence. He spends the next 400 years looking for his lost love and contemplating his ephemeral pleasures.  Believing Ignacia to be dead, he and his ageless dog,Pedro, encounter some of history's more interesting chocolate connosseurs.<br />My one problem with this book was in the way that Diego realizes that what he thinks is a short time is actually a very long time spanning many generations of people.  Somehow Diego seems to transport himself through some kind of time warp which moves him rapidly forward on the timeline of history without actually sensing the time pass at all.  When he is actually in the company of other humans, time again seems to slow down to the normal pace; it is only between the various encounters and locales that time seems to take on this wormhole quality.<br />Diego's melancholy with regard to his frustrated efforts to find Ignacia at times becomes tedious, otherwise, some of his comments regarding life and pleasure are insightful and amusing.<br />All around, I felt this book well worth the effort spend reading it. In particular, I loved the descriptions of the spices and the techniques used to create some of the sinfully delicious sounding chocolate delicacies.  Reading the author's thoroughly sensual prose was akin to popping the highest quality dark chocolate in my mouth and savoring its melt and aftertaste.reate some of the sinfully delicious sounding chocolate delicacies.

Now this secret may be the leverage she needs to get her son out of the legal grasp of her vindictive ex-husband.  She needs only to acquire a bit of archaeological treasure to set her trap and quantum physicist Manolis Minakis seems to hold the key to the very treasure trove she seeks.<br />There is one unknown that challenges her scheme:  it seems that Manolis himself has masterminded the entire game from the very start. He has lured Anne-Marie's new husband to a symposium on quantum physics, manupulated the man whom Anne-Marie desperately needs to aid her in her quest for her son and enticed Anne-Marie herself to his homeland on Crete where he enfolds his own strange personal history.<br />The outcome is a pleasing story of two people of different generations with the identical need to salvage the good from their past in order to face the future in a positive manner.<br />I enjoyed this story immensely---I did not buy it because it was supposedly a Sci-Fi tale; it has little science fiction.  Rather I found the characterizations and descriptions of Greek village life vivid and fulfilling, especially when set against the foil of such archaeological greats like Sir Arthur Evans and John Pendlebury.<br />A most satisfying story!	2002-08-30

The orgy-like parties that call for human \\"volunteers\\" in alternating Carnival locales in the world reminded me of Jeanette's trendy night club scene and the enlightened Peter Octavian is pretty much a clone of Forever Knight's Nikolai the detective who has eshewed the hunting habits of the normal vampire, instead satiating himself by drinking cow's blood.<br />However, this is where the similarity ends.  OSAS's main plot revolves around a controlling faction of the Roman Catholic Church.  An ancient text which invalidates the well-known stipulations that vampires have dealt with since the very first i.e. exposure to the sun's rays equals death, is stolen by an outraged cardinal with intent to loose the book's devastating information through the media.  Sorcerers of the controlling faction are unleashed and the most ancient vampires from around the world are brutally destroyed along with various human persona that the cardinal indirectly and directly involves in his desire to put the book's contents in the public eye. As the vampires become informed with regard to the invalidity of their former constraints, the book moves towards a decisive battle between the sorcerers and the vampires at the novel's conclusion.<br />Although I liked this book's premise, I found some of the characters lacking--particularly the character of Meghan, Peter's human love interest who is eventually 'brought across'.  From the start, she is much too considerate and understanding of Peter's nature, becoming outraged rather than frightened when Peter metamorphs into a wolf while battling a zombie in her apartment.

Still, if you like vampire stories, I will not deter you from reading this one, it is admirable especially if you are intrigued by the idea of vampires who have been tricked into believing their own limitations by a controlling Church.

Upon re-reading it --actually listening to the Chiver's Unabridged audio, I realize it is just as well-crafted albeit sprinkled too liberally with adjectives as any of the other more well known Stewart titles.<br /><br />In particular, without the compelling tell-all 1st person narrative usually facilitated by Stewart, the heroine of the tale, one Jennifer Silver, comes across as exactly what she is--a 22 year old with the scant experience of any young girl coming straight out of the sheltered privileged environment of upper class Britain--instead of the usual intrepid/curious/resourceful  traveler of the other stories.<br /><br />Here, Jennifer has traveled to the wild southwestern portion of France, where the Pyrenees form the country's natural boundary from Spain.  Excited to meet up with her half-French cousin, Gillian, she is utterly shocked to encounter Stephen, a music student acquaintance of her father with whom she had a brief but platonic flirtation years prior to coming to France.  As with the other Stewart novels, romance comes secondary, if not thirdly in importance when weighed against the circumstances of the mystery within the plotl ine. And here,it tends to be a little melodramatic--Stephen, the brooding musician reining in his feelings of passion for Jennie, and Jennie, herself, not even realizing what passion is.<br /><br />Far better is the novel's main thrust--for when Jennie attempts to contact her cousin at the local convent where the half-French girl is deciding upon a religious vocation, Jennie discovers rather abruptly from the convent's bursar that her cousin has died and has been buried within the convent walls.  Shocked but by no means mentally incapacitated, Jennie realizes that Dona Francisca's story does not make sense, as Jennie knows one or two things about her cousin that renders the explanation totally invalid.  Here Jennifer takes the initiative as do all the Stewart heroines--hell bent to discover the truth with no thought to her own safety.  The path she follows is a treacherous one, involving the bursar, her plans for the convent and illegal doings that make the locale's proximity to Spain extremely convenient.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, listen to the audio book, Harriet Walker's command of voices help convey the characters of each of the novel's persona with startling reality.  This novel, I believe to be overlooked, but don't make that mistake, do read it and savor its passionate story--just undermine the romance.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />&#34;reneofc&#34;o things about her cousin that renders the explanation totally invalid.

US	53093124	R3IYOPYCA8NFR6	0151132143	747299893	Blood Dance	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Atmospheric Greek Drama	James William Brown masterfully recreates the microcosmic atmosphere of warmth, closeness, suspicion and gossip that are intrinsic to any small place where generations of people have lived and worked since the beginning of time. The village, as divided into distinct dramatic choruses of &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot;, is as much a character in this story as is &quot;Katrina&quot;, the citified, unaccepted archaeologist who marries the village's favorite son, and their silently rebellious daughter, &quot;Amalia&quot;, who grows from childhood to womanhood as the story unfolds. Different life altering events trigger different reactions from the main voices; we see the action from the four above-named perspectives.  Above all, one thing the inhabitants of the Island agree upon besides their absolute need for a continuance of and adherance to the island's old traditions, is their resistance to change as introduced by the stranger--in this case a young Scandanavian hustler.  Intrigued, young Amalia finds herself attracted to what the stranger represents--freedom from her inevitable future as an island woman--escape from the island itself--her needs and desires as mirrored through her actions catapult the village into a whirlwind of reaction that drives the rest of the story and reveals secrets of the past and present that only such an isolated place can store up and preen over like a hoard of buried treasure.<br /><br />I recommend this story as the four distinctive voices move it along brisquely--and yes, with some repetition necessary to complete the cyclical structure as represented by the blood dance itself.  This type of tale succeeds in peeling back the holiday ambiance and charm of the white-washed Greek Isle to reveal real people that are true to the Homeric characters of old.	2002-08-09

My only problem with some of her suggestions is she gives a range of dosage which may or may not work for each individual.  In her defense, on this point, she does suggest various tests to help you get a better fix on what you need to eliminate symptoms.  However, for those of us who are used to having a doctor prescribe based on weight or age and blindly follow their advice, this trial and error will seem tedious, but I do believe it is the only solution, especially in the light of the results of the government's HRT study disclosured in the early part of the summer.<br />Gittleman has many 'zappers' --- treatment suggestions for different perimenopausal problems.  Again, there are so many of them, they too may seem a bit overwhelming, but she sprinkles her advise with real life case histories which help the reader relate or not relate to her main purpose.  Among the high points, her progesterone cream usage advise is indispensable as is her advise regarding the use of soy in the diet and the supplementation of B vitamins and calcium along with magnesium; but do keep in mind, that again, the quantities she suggests need to be tried out on your individual body and adjusted in accordance to symptom relief.<br />I think Gittleman's main message is natural, natural, natural. Diet and supplements are the answer.  Fill your body with healthy foods as food in this instance and in all others acts as a good medicine and can help in ways you cannot imagine.<br />I have literally poured over this book--my copy is in utter tatters; the information is that good.

Dintino points all women in a direction where through meditation and experience they will find meaning regarding themselves.  At a young age, Auriellia hears voices and sees things; the Cretan hierarchy interprets this as a divine calling to the priesthood of the snake.  Under the tutelage of Barbara, Auriella undergoes the bitter journey of the acolyte, where when bitten by the snakes and saturated with their venom, her visions form prophesies that are recorded by the council of elders.  She sees a future where the goddess is no longer worshipped and sadly women are persecuted for their herblore and mutilated by the world of men.  Horrified, Auriellia is driven to look further into the meaning of her own life and to insure that people of the future remember the ancient mysteries.<br />Dintino manages to create the vibrant doggedness of Auriellia's character yet fails to give the reader the sense that she is a woman of another time. Her selection of the matriarical society of Minoan Crete to backdrop her message while intriguing was lackluster.  I did not get a sense of the people or community.  Mostly I would have liked to see more myth wrapped within the tale. Case in point, as the labyrinth is detailed within the story's structure as an intitiation ground, I would have enjoyed a reference to the minotaur myth. . . but, perhaps Dintino's tale predates this.<br />Overall this was an interesting spiritiual read; Auriellia's awakened feelings as a mother are right on the mark and beautiful to read.	2002-07-30

I have been on the program at the advice of my health care provider for over 2 months and have slimmed down without really dieting all while feeling a heck of a lot better.

Enter the professor--an intriguing combination of sophistication and magnanimousity in as much as he seems to know what Laura needs even before she does while worshiping her body in a way that her husband never has, would or even could.  Although Laura knows from the get-go that there is no future to their relationship, she cannot help but wonder about what could be.  She moves through the self-questioning phases of her divorce and her feelings about her inadequacy in the light of the failure of her marriage. Only the short duration rendez-vous with M. act as steadying high points of light in the otherwise dark tunnel portion of her life. However, rather than detail the agony of vulnerability, the author cheerfully focuses mainly on the magical healing quality that the pure physical pleasure her relationship with M induces. Wise M. knows instinctively when she is healed and without a fuss he disappears as quietly as he appears. As additional succor of the gods, Fraser includes wonderful travelogue descriptions of exotic trysting places while simultaneously reporting her progress towards a new life through the acute observations that M. makes each time they meet in a new locale.<br />The story is told in the second person a la Italo Calvino; this technique moves the tale along quickly and smartly.  Originally, I picked this book up thinking it was a novel and intrigued as it seemed to be about Italy, a country I have an immense fondness towards.  Even though, the story is true, and has less to do with Italy than I first perceived, I would still recommend it as a pleasant 2 evenings worth of fast and fun reading.ss to do with Italy than I first perceived, I would still recommend it as a pleasant 2 evenings worth of fast and fun reading.	2002-07-23

As she serendipitiously happens upon an art exhibit in noted museum, she is plunged headlong into the bleak ever-present knowledge that her twin sister, Jane--abducted from her St. Charles Avenue neighborhood 18 months earlier---is still unaccounted for and may well be dead as are 11 other women from the New Orleans area.  The exhibit provides a merciless clue to the mystery and outcome of Jane's disappearance:  the series of oil paintings depict women who at first appear to be sleeping, but in actuality are dead.  As Jane is featured in one of the painting, Jordan realizes that the other women in the other paintings may well be the other missing women.<br />The story flashes to New Orleans where the reader is treated to the local color and the author's obvious intimate relationship with this sultry city of the Mississippi delta.  Jordan becomes an integral part of the ongoing FBI investigation of the missing women as the team narrows down the possibilities in light of Jordan's revelations regarding correlation between the paintings and the victims.<br />In the style he used so well in \\"Mortal Fear\\", Iles explores Jordan's past in relation to current events--on the surface we glimpse a woman who appears comfortable in her own skin, yet Iles probes deeper until we see the vulnerability that enables Jordan to eventually see eye to eye with the deranged artist/murderer responsible for the abductions and the masterpieces.<br />We meet again Dr. Lenz, the FBI consultant from Iles previous novel \\"Mortal Fear\\" and a cast of new characters observed from Jordan's cool but smouldering point of view.<br />One criticism, Iles is obviously creating a woman that any man would kill to be around--she's talented, attractive and not demure when it comes down to what needs to be done both on a sexual and practical level.  But choosing a sugary Coke over a Diet at age 40?  I sincerely doubt it.<br />The plot moves along at a breakneck pace which is soothed by the writer's dreamy portrait of the city and its environs. Adding the confused ambiance of Vietnam/Cambodia and Jordan's troubled remembrances of her father who was lost there during the war years of the 60s-70s, keeps the story personal as bits and pieces of Jordan's psyche are revealed along with that of the four suspects the FBI has focused on to further their investigation.

When his agent dies, he surprisingly is approached by any writer's dream agent who has an interesting propostion for him.  He will be given someone's secret diary and he will fictionalize it within 3 weeks.  A guard will accompany the installments of the original manuscript to ensure that Carl does not copy it and at the same time, deliver the finished fictionization to the agent.  For doing this, Carl receives $50k up front, $50K when he finishes and the guarantee that his first book be published and seriously marketed.  Carl readily accepts, burning the midnight oil to fulfill his end of the deal, but when his new agent and a female neighbor mysteriously end up dead, Carl finds himself out on a limb from which he cannot possibly survive, as he is thought to be and labeled by the media a serious killer on a mission.<br /><br />Sound fascinating?<br /><br />It is----but sadly, once the actual diary is read and transformed into Carl's manuscript, the killings are executed and Carl has no where to run, the book just loses steam fast.  Suddenly the interesting premise transmogrifies into formula--Carl's ex-girlfriend (conveniently a Wash. Post journalist) becomes involved and the reader follows the actions of a ring of outsiders whose histories eventually tie together to lead to the plot's denouement.  Problem is, it is just too formula to be fresh and lead to disappointment even when reading the book's most startling revelations.<br />I picked this book up after reading this writing teams' latest offering, &quot;Icarus&quot;.  Although, I found &quot;Icarus&quot; to be a moderate-to--superior suspense type yarn, I expected Gideon to be better based on its reviews.  I was disappointed.	2002-07-19

As a resident of the metro-New Orleans area, I am inundated with sightings of Sugar-Busters marketed products from whole wheat pasta to ice cream. Believe me going to the supermarket is one big marketing hype especially in the smaller New Orleans based stores, since this slim volume was written by one CEO and a group of local physicians---a pretty tough group to contradict. As the products are easy for me to find, I lived the diet---Guess what?  In spite of the hype, it didn't work for me.  It didn't change my weight one way or the other.<br />This leads me to believe that everybody is as different as we are told we are and one diet does not fit all.  Eating ice cream--tasteless ice cream at that--does not work for me whether it has sugar in it or not. Neither does eating whole wheat spirals marketed with the SUGAR-BUSTERS logo.<br />Like the Zone, Atkins and other low-carb diets, this diet's main concentration is on using protein consumption to trigger glucagon rather than insulin production in the pancreas. I have no problem with this premise as it obviously works for so many people--myself included--- even though the idea has been panned by dieticians for as long as they have been touted by their creators. Fat does not seem to matter---but eating bacon?  With all those nitrates? Please! The usual suspects of sugar, white flour products, pre-packaged meals in a box, and high glycemic index carbohydrates are rounded up and eliminated.  But the book fails to mention that certain people do not process dairy well, or crustaceans, or red meat etc.  After all there are millions of folks out there who have eaten vegetarian style whole foods -- heavy on the whole grains and carbs and low on the fat---with SUPER results.  Bottom line?  Everyone is different.  Once the principles of horomone balance are understood, there is a need for some sort of nutritional discipline that aids us in tracking food results on a food by food basis.<br />Another problem with this diet is its lack of portion control.  No matter what anyone says, MD. CEO or not, eating too much good, sugarless food and not burning it off,will put on weight--or keep it on.  Simple mathematical fact of life.<br />This diet does seem to work for a certain percentage of people--we need to figure out just what &quot;type&quot; this percentage represents, then find appropriate diets for the rest of the us.lack of portion control.

I admit to being skeptical at first, the idea of blood type having anything to do with what you ate, how you felt and what kind of personality you had seemed a bit far-fetched. I also wondered how I would adapt to the largely unavailable whole grains and Omega-3 rich fish that I was supposed to be eating.  Unfortunately, I live in an area where whole foods are considered extravagently obsessive and seafood means shrimp and crawfish, both no-nos for me on this dieting plan.  My shopping is now limited to a once a week foray into the city to the only Whole Food Market in the entire metro area!  Nonetheless, I find the on-going results positive.  I am eating lots of fruit, fish, the occasional chicken and turkey enhanced by lots of soy products.  I have even begun juicing again, taking my juicer down from the supply closet where it was placed when I was in my low-carb phase.  I have discovered Ezekial bread which makes a fantastic toast which I admit to pathetically dreaming about while I exercise prior to eating.<br />I purchased this book to supplement my rather scant knowledge of vegetarian and whole food cuisine and have found it more than adequate.  Each food group is represented by recipes that are specifically labeled as A, B, O or AB friendly.  In addition, there are specific A,B,O or AB ingredients added or removed in certain recipes to make them extra friendly to your type--a nice lagnaippe!  I have subtracted a star only because it does not have as many fish recipes as I would like!<br />Best of all,I find that I have not tested any of the snack or dessert recipes.  The reason for this is simple:  I HAVE NOT HAD ANY DESIRE FOR SUGAR and absolutely no desire to eat in between meals.  Since my body is happily receiving what it needs, it isn't bothering me with the constant craving I usually experience when using a different dieting plan. On the digestive end, I have not had any bloating or stomach aches, and I have been able to stop taking a popular and expensive fiber therapy!<br />Keep in mind that if you are a mainstream eater---meals out of a box, or junk food junkie, you are going to have a difficult adjustment to make when trying or just reading this diet through the first time.

Give it a shot--it may take a while to see results, but I think your body's acceptance and performance will tell the real story.	2002-07-12

The author does a fine job of defining the Greek's sense of honor and family as she relays the struggles Nikos endures as he goes about performing his duty on board ship and fulfilling his responsibilities as the not-home father of two sons.  It seems life is nothing but duty and responsibility for Nikos who indulges in the occasional shipboard romance, but it is only when he meets 35 year old Alexa does he actually fall in love.  Unfortunately, as the couple finds out, in spite of their efforts to be together as much as possible, the fruition of their love is not meant to be--in fact it is utterly impossible. We find Alexa following Nikos about like the doomed woman in &quot;Back Street&quot;, always taking a back seat to the demands of Nikos' life.  Nikos is equally tortured and one cannot help but ask throughout the various cruises that the couple shares how else could the affair end up with Nikos' need to be at sea his overriding passion in life?<br />The author's style is minimalist; she adequately conveys the angst of her creations.  However, since common sense deems the entire situation fruitless, I think the author struggled to find an ending that would both finish the book satisfatorily and still be realistic.  I found her use of the Cyprus crisis in the 70s timely, but not quite good enough; the story ends on a bad note, relaying both Alexa's and Nikos' final feelings in separate chapters.<br />I recommend instead &quot;The Sailor's Wife&quot; which although a completely different story relates the life of the Greek Island peasant so magnificently, the reader will overlook its rather inadequate ending also.	2002-07-11

As a child, Jack watches his mother die at the hands of a deranged murderer who hurls her body through the window of a Manhattan skyscraper, Nevertheless, he manages to make a success of his life:  he acquires a classy drop-dead gorgeous wife and partner, cultivates a lucrative string of top-notch restaurants and still manages to maintain his loyalty to those he has met along the way to reaping the lavish rewards of his work.  Basically he wants for nothing, even challenging his own fear of heights by purchasing a penthouse apartment several stories above ground level.<br />Problem?  Yes.  Disaster strikes a second time when Jack's wife dies exactly the same way as his mother and again Jack witnesses the entire event.  Bereft and broken, Jack comes back to life with the help of a younger protegee, Kid Demeter, a personal trainer with a style both motivating and mysterious.  Throughout Jack's recovery, he hears about Kid's edgy lifestyle, epitomized by the high-maintenance women in his life.  The \\"team\\" as Kid labels them are chivalrously referred to only by nicknames, so when Kid himself is found dead after being thrown from his Tribeca apartment window, Jack does not have a clue as to how to convince the police that Kid's death was murder and not suicide.<br />By far, the most interesting aspect of this book was Jack's foray into Kid's nighttime world of private clubs and fast women. It is here that the author's minimalist's style really works to convey the multi-layered truths of the demimonde as as seen from Jack's skewed perspective.<br />This novel picks up momentum once the murders of Jack's mother and wife are recounted.  There is little dialogue in this first portion of the story so the reader gets the false sense that the author's style needs an injection of life while I believe his intention is merely to supply background information for the real tale.<br />This is not great literature---however, it is the perfect read for a trip or a day at the beach where one wants to be moved along by an interesting plot and not the artistry of wordplay.tale.<BR>This is not great literature---however, it is the perfect read for a trip or a day at the beach where one wants to be moved along by an interesting plot and not the artistry of wordplay.	2002-07-10

I found it did not work.<br />Supposedly, I am a T-type, but I found that the more I read about the other types, P and A--I could have been typed as one of those too!  I was certain of only one thing--I was not a G-type.  First of all, the pictures depicting the types are simply awful, giving generalized physical traits that again I could say typified me.  Yes, I did take the test which investigates your cravings, your fat gaining patterns and your overall outlook, but even on these issues, over the years, after adhering to so many different dieting philosophies I have found that my cravings have changed as my nutrition education increased.  Quite frankly, I could not remember what I \\"craved\\" twenty years ago! After childbearing, I could not remember where I gained my fat prior to the monumental hormonal event of pregnancy!<br />In spite of my confusion, I did try the T-type diet, thinking that since this type was the type allotted me after taking the test, I should at least try it.  I found that after practising the Zone, where I was eating more fresh vegetables and fruit, this diet added grain which ADDED weight rather than eliminated it.  The induction portion of this diet where one eats mainly the type-specific vegetable soup did not inch me off my plateau either.  Bottom line was I either did not type myself accurately or the diet just didn't work for me.<br />This particular edition of the book contains updated exercise information which while interesting I also found confusing.  Supposedly, T-types should do stretching and relaxing exercises, but common sense tells us that a little weight training and aerobics certainly is beneficial for all!  Where, other than in Dr. A's experience and practice, is his exercise---or for that matter, his entire--- theory proved?<br />As with any of the other fad diets, this diet has its newletter, website and expensive supplements specifically designed to benefit each type.

The actual diet is not even covered.<br />Instead, in this volume, Sears backs up his original premise---a perfect balance of 30% protein, 40% carbohydrates and 30% fat with each meal ensures the bodies balance of the two hormones glucagon and insulin and produces good eicasanoids. He focuses on how to make every meal a Zone perfect meal.  He begins with the FDA required &quot;Nutrition Facts&quot; rectangle found on any prepackaged food and explains how you can add the proper component to make your food selection Zone perfect.<br />While interesting from a computational aspect, I found the whole experience of adding up my fat, carb and protein grams for every meal a little bizarre especially when attempting to do this in a restaurant.  I even downloaded the popular Excel-based program Zonepro and loaded it up with my personal food favorites' carb, protein and fat data so that I could come up with my own Zone perfect recipes.  This craze was a lot of fun(?) while it lasted, but the bottom line was that I didn't always end up with that euphoric Zone feeling that Sears touts in the book.  But then again,I didn't get it when I ate one of Sears' Zoneperfect bars!  When I called the Zone help line regarding this, I was told that I was most likely carb sensitive---apparently I had eaten so many carbs in the past, my body would not 'enter the zone' unless I ate only 2 blocks instead of the normal three for females and added an additional fat block. Confusing only because this did not work either.  I reached a dieting plateau and I wasn't moving.<br />Eventually I got less intense-- went back to the 'enter the zone&quot; eyeballing method of balancing my meal but I began to look into other issues in conjunction with balancing the two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon.  Certain foods just didn't work for me, no matter how balanced my entire meal was.  I tried many things: eliminating carbs totally, adding fiber, going a whole food route and eliminating dairy.  But I have not found the answer yet.<br />I am convinced there is a missing piece somewhere but I just have not figured out what will really work for me specifically.  So many people find that the Zone is the answer --I think it is only part of the answer for me.<br />As far as the book goes, if you want to read more about the Zone's theory and are not interested solely in the diet itself, go to the library and check this out--otherwise stick to Sears' first volume.ngs: eliminating carbs totally, adding fiber, going a whole food route and eliminating dairy.

Sears' premise is a relatively easy one to understand: eating protein with every meal helps to regulate your insulin output and hence helps the body avoid a constant craving for fattening carbohydrate intake.<br /><br />I purchased this book when it first came out in 1995, used it on and off with adequate results, and was dismayed when various news magazines and dieticians panned the premise. I thought, how could regulating hormones NOT be involved in the dieting puzzle?<br /><br />Recently I was reaquainted with Sears' ideas after seeing an alternative physician in my quest for better health. The doctor recommended using Sears hormone-regulating formula and portion guidelines with Peter D'Adamo's ER4YT Blood Type Diet. So far, I have had fairly good overall health-benefit results--and this with no intention of losing weight--although this has occurred.<br /><br />Although Sears comes off as being a little too commercial for my taste--just check out the Zoneperfect website and you will be bombarded with all sorts of prepackaged goodies--- his premise of eating a certain amount and a certain combination of the three basic nutritional elements seems to be quite wise. In a nutshell, one's hand is utilized to decide just how much one needs to put away during one meal. The protein should be the size of one's palm--thickness taken into account. The fat is represented by the size of the fleshy part of the thumb--about a tablespoon. Carbohydrates are monitored in this way: if eating a grain, a closed fist-sized amount should be consumed. If eating a green vegetable, two handfuls are advised.<br />As much as I find this advice feasible, I have some criticism with regard to Sears' premise and format. Firstly most of the recipes in the book seemed to be geared for bachelors who have little time for food preparation. Anyone wanting to make a Zone meal for a family would be pretty much out of luck if using the book as a guideline. The good news here is that the website provides many many recipes to help balance out those fats, proteins and carbs and there is an Excel based tool offered online at no-cost which actually calculates a meal's components down to the gram---if you want to get that specific. Secondly, Sears reports that one could lose weight with any combination, although he suggests for example that red meat and butter are poor choices when compared to other protein and fat choices. I believe that since this book has been written,Sears has come out with other \\"breakthrough\\" diets--one revolving around soy and one around Omega-3 fats. I can only charitably think that as his theories evolve more books will ensue. But, what he doesn't seem to cover is the fact that some people simply do not do well when eating certain foods. His one-size fits all diet, does not work for everyone. There is a dieting stall reached after awhile and the optimum results that he proports one will achieve are not achieved. Case in point, when I started the Zone vigorously, 3 years ago, I found that I had to incorporate more protein with every meal. I turned to dairy as I did not feel inclined to cook a chicken breast each and every time I wanted a snack. Unfortunately, no matter what Sears says, I do not metabolize dairy well and I found that no matter how many glasses of water I drank, no matter how many fish oil capsules I consummed, or how simple and abundant my carbohydrates were, I was still constipated. After adding a fiber supplement, I found I no longer lost weight--but stayed at a plateau for so long a period of time, I eventually tried another dieting plan. After all, no one feels well if their digestive system is no working correctly. Sears speaks of the digetive hormones, but he neglects to mention the changing hormonal interplay of estrogen and progesterone in women, especially as they get older. Nevertheless, I believe that Sears book can be the cornerstone for many who do not understand that food must be balanced to achieve a hormonally balanced body. In the same sense, in order to be a certain size, you must eat a certain amount. My advise is to use this as your springboard, then decide which combinations work best for you, perhaps, as my physician advised,try the D'Adamo blood type diet as a guideline for foods one should and shouldn't eat. I have found that since doing this, I no longer need my fiber supplement, I have lost weight, I do feel better. (Oddly enough, for my type A blood, I am to gorge myself on soy products and Omega-3 rich fish!  Sounds like Dr. Sears may be a blood type A himself as his latest books plug both as highly beneficial.)  Bottom line: if I feel better, I must be on the right track.In the same sense, in order to be a certain size, you must eat a certain amount.

Although I was thoroughly caught up in \\"Fortune's Rocks\\", finishing it within three sittings, I found the overall stilted tone of the story incongruous with its underlying premise of great passion. Grant it, Ms Shreve is attempting to capture the ambiance of a bygone era where upper-class women dressed in cumbersome multi-layered outfits for the sake of propriety rather than comfort. I suppose like everyone else, I have an imagined idea of that age:  lace high-necked blouses, pearl buttons and parasols.  Yet here, these accoutrements of proper dress camoflauge contricted souls straining for some sort of freedom.  We peer out at the world through the eyes of one of these stiffled bodies, fifteen year old Olympia Biddleford.  In keeping with our assumed sense of the early 20th century, the 3rd person narrator's voice is embued with the poetic cadence of lovely Edith Wharton-like language, Olympia's eyes wear the rose-colored glasses that Ms. Shreve and we assume are part and parcel of the turn-of-the-century social persona. And indeed, all this loveliness serves as a clever foil for the grittier aspects of the story---real life moments where sheltered Olympia comes face-to-face with the poverty of the working class, the squalid reality of seeing a woman give birth, and the desolation of her own ruin.  Okay, I get a sense of where Shreve intends the reader to go, but I think what works to underline the trap of class fails miserably when it is used in turn to describe Olympia's grand passion for 40+ doctor and essayist, John Haskell.  Olympia is indeed driven, but if we are told exactly why John Haskell seems to be the man to break the woman free from the confines of childhood, it is not done adequately.<br />Otherwise, the story is quite good, perhaps predictable, but not in a boring sense.  I particularly enjoy Ms Shreve's use of the cottage on Fortune's Rocks, one she has used before in \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" and mentioned in \\"The Weight of Water\\".  Reading again of the beach, the isles in the distance, and the house's history creates a familiar sensation of homecoming even though these places are filled with an unknown history of human suffering and remorse that is sensed by the very air breathed. I also think the comparisons to Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" ill-conceived.  Catherine and Heathcliff's love was all-consuming, violent and satisfied only through death.  Olympia and Haskell are again controlled, tortured perhaps, but much too aware of the strictures of their own society.beach, the isles in the distance, and the house's history creates a familiar sensation of homecoming even though these places are filled with an unknown history of human suffering and remorse that is sensed by the very air breathed.

US	53093124	RHLOI3R2TA2O6	0345366239	16404674	The Eight	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Historical Wonderland	In this novel, Katherine Neville writes a fast paced yarn that combines mysticism with an on-going history that spans two centuries from the late 18th during the upheavel of the French Revolution to the late 1970s during the rise of OPEC.<br /><br />The Plot:  Two women separated by time are joined in a singular and parallel effort to insure that the legendary Montglane chess set does not fall into the hands of the world's evil-minded.  Simultaneously, each woman has, unbeknownst to herself, become active in a living chess game---as one of the 32 white and black pieces.<br /><br />The Premise and its History:  The ultimate winner of the game, in obtaining the board,its pieces and its cloth cover, will be able to read the alchemic symbols etched upon all three parts and formulate the answer to one of life's most sublime quests.  The chess set, which originates in India four centuries prior to its receipt by the great French king Charmlemagne, is a gift from a Moslem governor of Barcelona.  When it is connected with stories of violence, bloodshed, and intrinsic evil, Charlemagne, out of a sense of survival for himself and his kin, buries the set within the Montglane fortress-turned abbey.<br /><br />Heroine from the 18th century:  In 1790, Mirelle de Remy, at the abbess of Montglane's request, flees to Paris with her cousin and some of the pieces.  She runs smack into the infamous Bishop of Autun, Talleyrand, whose motives the abbess fears most of all.<br /><br />Heroine from 1970s:  Cat Velis, computer expert is exiled through her own corporate blunder to Algeria, but before she departs from Manhattan, she is drawn into the game through the efforts of a seemingly innocent group of colleagues.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  Ms Neville's 500+ page read is both intriguing and entertaining.  Mirielle and Cat's stories are made in alternating chapter installments which keeps the reader informed of their eventual understanding and enlightenment with regard to the Montglane Chess Service without spoiling the finale for the reader.  The cast of characters from both time periods includes some of the most famous names in history.  As in her other novels, \\"The Magic Circle\\" and \\"A Calculated Risk\\", the women are young, highly intelligent, more-than-technologically capable, and under the tutelage of some strangely reclusive and extremely wealthy genius.  I can only wonder who has influenced Ms Neville to the such extremes that she needs to reproduce him in each of her novels.<br /><br />Overall recommendation:  Read it--its quite good--a little slow in spots---but the historical name-dropping--great mathematicians, musicians, monarchs, despots, revolutionaries, artists, etc., and the mystical aspects of the Chess Service keeps one thoroughly entertained.without spoiling the finale for the reader.

Rose Fenmore, professor of English Literature at Cambridge is like Ms. Stewart herself, a poet and a spinner of fantasy--for Rose in the form of Science Fiction novels under a nom de plume.  Stewart does a more than adequate job of portraying Rose's inner calmness in her choice of vacation, her penchant for wordplay and in the merging of the two: her gift for describing the tableau she sees before her with such detail, the reader can actually feel the breeze move strands of hair, hear the slightest stirrings of the night birds and sense the awe in which all characters become eventually humbled by nature's majesty.<br /><br />Rather than create a story of treachery as she has in the past,in the \\"Stormy Petrel\\", Stewart weaves a simple story which acts as a vehicle for her true love and the story's ultimate theme of preservation of nature's natural beauty.  With every quiet word, her love of Scotland and its lovely vistas are pronounced loudly and clearly. Her description of her own writing process as outlined poetically while Rose attempts to inch her scifi plot foward is a magnificent insight into Ms Stewart's own love of her craft.  I believe, the impact of the story's \\"mystery\\" and \\"romance\\" disregarded by the other reviewers, is all there---only it is as subtle and perfect as a bird's song and quite as easy to overlook when compared to the gun-in-the-back terror readers of Ms. Stewart (and her current crop of wannabees)have come to expect.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book, read by Isla Blair.  She does a wonderful job of conveying Rose's inner quietude and does justice to Stewart's lyrical descriptions of Rose's most monumental moments on the isolated island in the Scottish Hebrides: the evenings of seals' song and the nocturnal flight of the stormy petrel.<br /><br />This is recommended to anyone who has a love of nature, of beautiful language and who promises to regard the story and its soft cadences as a wise and truly loving tribute to nature.o has a love of nature, of beautiful language and who promises to regard the story and its soft cadences as a wise and truly loving tribute to nature.	2002-06-14

In his book, &quot;Joshua&quot;, Fr Girzone beautifully reexplores this territory first broached by Dostoevsky in his chapter &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; in &quot;the Brothers Karamazov&quot;.  Girzone asks the question, &quot;Can mankind shed its true nature, throw away its need for power and truly embrace the simple life that Christ advocates?&quot;  In &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot;, Christ reappears, His love of man evident in the simple miraculous acts he performs when he walks among the sick and poor.  These actions cause attention to be drawn to Him, and eventually He is imprisioned by the grand inquisitor who engages Him in a lengthy conversation regarding what the established Church provides the people and exactly what the Church is unwilling to sacrifice in order to truly follow Christ's example.  The Grand Inquisitor fully admits the the Church has supplanted the role of Christ in the lives of its congregation and in effect is responsible for the &quot;non-existence&quot; of God.<br /><br />Similarly, in &quot;Joshua&quot;, Christ reappears in a small town in upstate New York.  Joshua is a wood carver who lives simply, enjoys the beauty of nature and above all has the ultimate compassion for anyone he encounters who is in physical, spiritual or mental need.  Word of Joshua's simple lifestyle sets the town's ears on fire and curiosity drives them to meet Joshua for themselves.  No one is disappointed.  As Joshua's popularity grows, he is singled out by leaders of the established churches and the synagogue. As in the Grand Inquisitor, Joshua eventually comes head to head with the powerful leaders of the established religion and the egotistical need man has for power.  As in the gospels, His words are meant to break down the hierarchical authority that enslaves rather than frees its underlings. His message is heard only by a few and as in the past,it is discussed, mulled over and spread.  And when it becomes bureaucratized?<br /><br />This feel-good book has a simply rendered yet powerful message.

Having reached a dieting plateau, I was interested in discovering what else I could do in order to reach my goal of a healthy weight while still feeling good.<br /> More recently, I saw an alternative medicine physician who vehemently advocated a combination of the Zone portions and meal frequencies with the ER4YT philosophy.  As a type A, I supposedly could easily and according to the book should, become a vegetarian.  Red meat for me, is taboo as are wheat products and all manner of other supposedly healthy foods given thumbs up by other health guru standards.  For instance, growing up on Long Island, I always enjoyed fresh flounder and clam chowder---well, forget it---these foods are to be avoided on ER4YT for blood type A. D'Adamo instructs type As to eat more tofu and soy--and this seems to correspond to current traditional medical and health trends.  However, while some things make sense, other things do not; I find that overall I am puzzled as to why some foods aggitate the system and others do not.<br />  While D'Adamo's history of blood types is facinating, I wonder just how valid it all is in terms of his actual research premise.  If his premise on lectins and agglutination is valid, why doesn't someone from traditional medicine research its claims and comment on it?  Should I acquiesce to the usual conspiracy theory that warring schools of thought fight dirty and neither should be accepted as fonts of actual truth?<br />Bottom line: for the virgin dabbling in current cult dietary best-sellers, this diet will be difficult to follow--there are just too many rules and regulations.  For those who have already tried alternative grains and vegetable based proteins, the road will be a little easier, but still rocky until all the rules are commited to memory.  D'Adamo doesn't really get into portions, if he does, forgive my relapse in memory. If you follow the guidelines regarding portion size and meal frequency as outlined by Barry Sears and the Zone, you should lose weight.  If not, hormones and how they affect hunger, health and weight gain are not touched upon in this book and I believe should be.<br /><br />I also question D'Adamo's premise regarding the different exercise that should be done by the varying blood types.  What is this based upon?  In his lifetime, how has D'Adamo proved that lighter exercise like yoga and tai chi is better for Type As?<br /><br />On the positive side, a friend related a situation of an acquaintance who was tired and had digestive problems.  She recommended D'Adamo's book---after eliminating the foods on the AVOID list for her blood type, this person made a complete 180 turnaround; she felt better and her digestive problems ended, astounding her medical doctors.<br /><br />If it works---great---but I feel as if I need more information backing up D'Adamo's premise.

Once the headlines reflect the gruesome discovery, a copycat murderer stalks victims in the great metropolis and sends the police, the mayor's office and the museum into a frenzy of activity targeted for fast answers.  Only the mysterious New Orleanian Pendergast seems to have critical insight into the motives and operations of the killer and it is only through his laborous endeavors does the case come to a satisfactory end.<br /><br />As in their other colloborations, the authors manage to explore the dark side of human nature, yet in this particular installment, the shroud of darkness falls over Pendergast himself by touching on his family history.  Dr. Kelly and journalist Smithback's romance is continued with a delightfully light touch.<br /><br />The plot is fast-paced and recommended for anyone who enjoys a thriller with a scientific or medical connection.	2002-06-06

I thought the plot trivial, the heroine insipid and overall wondered if the author, always one of my favorites,was losing her magical touch that had inspired me for over 20 years.  Now, upon listening to the audio book version read by the talented Jane Asher, I believe my first impressions was wrong.<br /><br />Granted Geillis Ramsey is not Mary Stewart's typical heroine:  the career girl on vacation or on the new job who through a set of odd happenstances literally must fend for her life.  Geillis is reflective.  While Ms Stewart's other heroines, report and record the vivid locales through the sense-provoking medium of the author's glorious prose, Geillis Ramsey revels in it.  She is an older contemplative Ms Stewart telling of her love of home, relating small yet monumentally beautiful occurrences of her own life, set in the green splendour of the UK.  At the same time, she weaves these &quot;little things&quot; into a feasible fictional story of a lonely girl who with the help of an older unorthodox cousin finds her special niche in terms of self, community and finally love.  The elan of witchcraft interjects a minor touch of the old Stewart suspense, but, on the whole, I believe this is Ms Stewart's tribute to life, love, and nature.<br /><br />Lyrically beautiful and highly recommended.	2002-06-06

Case in point, Ms. Stewart's first work of suspense fiction:  \\"Madam Will You Talk?\\"  Her heroine, Charity Shelbourne is instantly likeable--a WW2 war widow who lovingly carries a framed photo of Johnny, her fallen RAF pilot in her suitcase,gladly expends time from her own holiday to entertain a lonely 14-year-old boy and honestly is confident enough about her own looks to admit when another woman is breathtakingly beautiful. True to her name and her noble instincts, Charity plunges unwittingly yet rather intelligently into a post war intrigue involving the estranged boy, his agressively tenacious father and the boy's lovely yet frightened stepmother using all the wit and willpower that made the British so heroically stoic through WW2.  The characters play against the lush backdrop of the walled hilltop villages of Avignon and Nimes and eventually the cosmopolitan splendour/squallor of Marseilles which we see, smell and hear from the passenger side of Charity's car in a chase sequence more harrowingly memorable than that in the film \\"The French Connection\\".  Ms . Stewart delivers not only a nicely summed up tale of greed and murder, but neatly fills Charity's emotional void and our own as she allows Charity to utilize Johnny's devil-may-care driving tips, rebel savvy and masculine assuredness through each twist of the plot on her way to finding her way in the world without him while opening her heart to someone else.  She is a woman all women want to be:  vulnerable yet indispensible.  The essential ingredients are all there for a most wonderful episodic film about a wily 20th century woman--get those cameras rolling!  Highly recommended, especially in the unabridged audio format.	2002-06-06

However, once the suspense climax is reached and the sinister plot puzzled out, the authors have a hard time keeping the reader's adrenaline pumping at the same heart wrenching pace.  Somehow, the actual scene where McBride enacts his revenge seems trivial, a necessary part of the story, but one the reader flies through with the hope that there is a twist that will topple what he already believes to be true and again skyurocket his manufacture of adrenaline.<br /><br />I read this book while traveling via plane; it is more than adequate to keep one's attention, the premise and the facts gathered to offer the denouement are plausible and sufficiently sinister to make one wonder where and when such events actually occur.  I will read another John Case thriller in the future.	2002-05-17

(The theory touched upon in the audio book was thoroughly interesting and well-presented.) We get a sense of the encumberment of genius from a social standpoint.  Nasar tells us that Nash could not just live in that beautiful mind of his, he needed to reach out and relate to other people--how he does this is related on most of the second tape where we are informed of his variely of relationships with other men, the mother of his first born, his wife Alicia and his colleagues.  When Nash descends into the depths schizophrenia, we are privy to the sense of helplessness that those reponsible for him endured and we are pleased that the mathematical community, recognizing how atypical this man's brilliance is, banded together to help him in any way they could. Most remarkable of all is Nash's ascendance from delusion resulting in his present ability to rejoin the research community as a viable member.<br /><br />The sheer magic of this man's brain and willpower will tantalize you with a tiny glimpse of genius while the magnanimity of his family and friends kalidescope around you with the possibilities that community can help one man achieve. Nasar's style is both chatty and informative--this book is an all around winner.	2002-04-04

By listening to what they think and watching only what they deem important enough to air, we are being taught how we are supposed to think and act.  The reality presented on TV is certainly not the real American reality.<br /><br />In this book, insider Bernard Goldberg reveals that for years the elite, removed clique that runs television news has made it its business to pass their liberal slant on current issues as the middle of the road American point-of-view.  Anytime an issue needs the backup of expert opinion, the conservative side of the story  is always labeled by news journalists as 'conservative' or 'right-wing' while the liberal counterpart is introduced or cited with no prefacing label as if this opinion was considered the moderate or middle of the road stance. When Goldberg attempted to point out that true journalism meant merely reporting the news and not editorializing it by writing a op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal denouncing one newscasters inappropriate bias regarding a presidential candidates flat tax idea, he was chewed up so badly by his employer, CBS news, he eventually found himself out of a job.<br /><br />Goldberg recounts the struggle he underwent with the moguls of CBS news, but even more interestingly, he informs us of certain big stories that are blown out of proportion by the media. Why?  The networks work hand in hand with lobbying groups that they share views with and make sure their shared message gets across during prime time.  On the other hand, certain really important stories and study outcomes are suppressed because the news media does not think their liberal-leaning backers really want to hear the real facts about some of the effects of their life decisions.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The news is an entertainment like all else on television.  If it doesn't get the ratings, it doesn't get the advertisers.  Advertisers won't pay if they are not reaching their audiences. The target audience consists of a small elite moneyed group whose profile is rather removed from that of the average American.<br /><br />Mr. Goldberg presents his arguement clearly and fairly succinctly while he is being both brash and amusing.  Reading this book is no chore, and it may enlighten those who have read it to form a campaign to demand 'Only the facts' from anyone who dares report it.  Bernie, you go, guy!entertainment like all else on television.  If it doesn't get the ratings, it doesn't get the advertisers.  Advertisers won't pay if they are not reaching their audiences.

Joyce, used to flaunting her young body in a bikini, must now keep her eyes downcast while walking through the rural village as if she does not, she will attract the young soldiers who will think she is nothing better than a prostitute. In spite of the hard work she must do each day to help her elderly in-laws eke out a living, she finds happiness in feeling that her efforts amount to something.  In fact, she loves the work and her relationship with her in-laws a little more than than she atually loves her virtually unknown spoiled and arrogant husband who when on leave, treats her like a beloved pet rather than his wife. As the sailor of the title,  Nikos is gone for months at a time, and naturally Joyce is lonely for people her own age.  When handsome Brit, Alex appears in the small village, Joyce's fragile equilibrium is finally toppled and earth-shattering events occur faster than one of the area's most devastating earthquakes.<br />I loved the interplay between Joyce and her in-laws; the love and regard between them was built up nicely by the author.  However, I found the ending a little disorienting and a little rushed.  I realize that Joyce made all her decisions in the story from an immature standpoint, and that her actions would have been interpreted in the village in only one way, but I still would have liked the story to end a little more definitively.<br /><br />All in all, the novel is definitely worth reading,if only to get that bird's-eye-view of what life on a beautiful Greek island would really be like.	2002-04-03

Perhaps--and I say this sarcastically--- it would make a good lunch-hour filmed children's special with the modern story acting as a kick-off introduction for the retelling of the Greek Myths. The book focuses on a classics professor from Britain and a beautiful artist from Mykonos; they fall in love only because the mischevious Greek Pantheon deems that it must be so.  Great.  Problem is that between all the falling in love and dialogue between the gods, there is an awful lot of silly nonsense that goes on where the author showcases the places--both historical and modern---and its important personages in a cartoony tutorial where either the professor, the artist or the professor's students get to show off their knowledge of Greece in typified travelogue fashion.  ZZZzzz<br /><br />Anyone interested in reading such a book, already knows such stories, and could repeat them with more panache than the author.  We needed more plot and less sidebars.<br /><br />The star goes to the lovely and whimisical drawings of Mykonos and its unearthly inhabitants.	2002-04-03

In &quot;The Blank Wall&quot;, Lucia is a well-meaning dedicated Navy wife,responsible for her father and her two teen-aged children.  She is making an admirable go of it, managing from day to day, providing nurture in the form of balanced meals in spite of rationing, reliable steadfast advise for her elderly father and her normally angst ridden teenagers and deliberately routine letters sent to her husband to insure him of their normalcy.  When her 17-year old daughter's involvement with a sleazy pornographer comes to Lucia's attention, her normal , just-getting-by existence is shattered.  Suddenly she is forced to deal with the shady Mr. Nagle and his associate Mr. Donnelly to protect her way of life.  The outcome is more than she bargained for...<br /><br />In &quot;The Innocent Mrs. Duff&quot;, Mr. Duff has become bored with his young wife, Reggie, twenty years his junior.  He imagines how wonderful his life would be again if his first wife had not died. While fantasizing about ridding himself of Reggie and perhaps starting a life with his son's nanny, Miss Castle, the uppercrust Duff entangles himself with his street smart driver, Nolan and embarks on an interlude that jeopardizes everything he holds dear.<br />The author allows the reader of both these novellas to really get into the day-to-day nitty-gritty that actually makes people people.  Through dialogue and musings, we see the inner workings Lucia and Duff well enough understand their predicaments and shake our heads over the turn of events.<br /><br />The Blank Wall was made into a movie &quot;The Deep End&quot;; the circumstances revolving around the blackmailing motif in the movie have been slightly modernized, but the emotions of the two main characters are superbly transferred to the screen.<br /><br />Thoroughly and strongly recommended to all those who love classic suspence.love classic suspence.	2002-03-28

The existence of the exotika, or \\"outsiders\\" is handled in very specific ways by the people of Apeiranthos i.e. Greece--indeed, there is a ceremony or spell that counteracts either their ill effect or their general contact. Stewart relates the interesting correlation between the Orthodox saints and the exotika and the way in which the Orthodox Church sanctions the actions of their congregations in combatting the exotika's evil influence. The author also attributes the general elevation in the degree of formal education to the overall reduction of such superstition.<br />In general, this book was not a breeze to read as it is intended for the student of University level anthropological studies. However, as a lover of the Levant, I found the subject intriguing and well worth the two weeks that it took me to actually read and make notations regarding the book's contents.<br />This is a great companion piece to Lawson's \\"Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion\\" and the Blum's \\"The Dangerous Hour: The Lore and Culture of Mystery and Crisis in Rural Greece.	2002-02-13

This book is a real treat---the reader embarks on the plot in very much the same way as he/she would enter a room and observe its inhabitants; by catching glimpses of  the conversations and attempting to draw meaning from the actions.  The Caesar dance studio is a full blooded organism--throbbing with the people who make it work--each of these people have lives--many lives which are disclosed partly but mostly are kept private--very much like our own.  As the \\"new kid on the block\\", the reader is allowed to let all the impressions sink in and actually speculate, as does Inspector Terry, the police detective called on the job when the Caesar's lead dancer is discovered missing right before a key performance.<br />This \\"slice of life\\" technique works wonderfully well, upstaging the actual mystery with its sophisticated nuances and effective dialogue.<br />A word of warning, Ms. Spindler forces you to like her characters and you will feel pain when they are hurt, physically and mentally.  Inspector Terry is sensitive and not the usual brilliant sleuth--what a relief!<br />I cannot wait to read the next installment of Inspector Terry's career.

When Guy Carson, a brilliant albeit grunt scientist from another GeneDyne Corp facility, is suddenly and finally singled out by GeneDyne's prodigy founder and leader, Brent Scopes, to leave immediately for White Sands, he finds himself puzzled by both the X-FLU project he is given to tackle and the cabin-fever-effected personalities of his colleagues.  In time, as he plummets through the highs and lows of hopeful success and frustrated failures, he discovers that his predecessor, a world renowned geneticist went out of his mind . . .<br />At Harvard University, Dr. Levine, human DNA preservationist and former friend of Brent Scopes, plans both legal and illegal ways of impeding the progress of the Mount Dragon work.  Of course, megalomaniac genius Brent Scopes is not about to let this happen.<br />Each chapter showcases either the handful of quirky scientists, the hell-bent activist or the eccentric CEO in a marvelous mix of cutting-edge science, big business, media manipulation, and computer tampering.

Frederick is a crack-pot archaeologist who having lost his professional footing with colleagues due to his Atlantis theories wishes to discover the 20th century equivalent to Schliemann's Troy.  He convinces Sandy to lie to her parents, meet him on the Greek Isle of Thera and dive in the treacherous expanse of sea that houses a live volcano.  For Sandy this beomes an experience of polarizing emotions---while the Minoan traces on the island speak to Sandy in a way she does not quite understand, the precarious position of Thera, between two tectonic plates, keeps her permanently unbalanced as does the flirtatious relationship that develops between her with Jim, a young archaelogist working for the competition and the father-daughter tie she feels despite the seemingly insensitive actions of her father.<br />Intermingled with the usual Barbara Michael's mix of historical data and romance, is the coincidental reunion of Frederick, Sir Christopher (another archaeologist), a mysterious woman with an equally mysterious name---Kore, and an ex German officer who shot Frederick and Sir Christopher's companion on Crete during the German occupation in WWII.<br />Although the modern sensibilites alloyed to the island's ancient past makes for a climate fraught with electricity, I felt that Sandy's overtly feminist opinions adversely dated what could have been a more timeless narrative.

Whereas the first three books of this epic was chuck full of time-travel, adventure, romance, witchcraft and the gritty but fully fascinating details of 18th century life, this latest offering putters to a stall in the slower-moving wake of number 4, &quot;The Drums of Autumn.&quot;<br />The reader re-enters the lives of the Frazers at the Gathering of the Clans on a North Carolina mountaintop in exactly the moment relayed in the last sentence of the 4th book . . . and sadly is stranded without respite from the gruesome and rather boring recounting of daily life--complete with overly ripe details of infant excrement, monthly bloodflows of both the newly nubile and the peremenopausal, as well as the use and postitioning of herbal poultices for pre-Pill birth control.<br />Yuck!<br />The intensely real vignettes that worked so well in the other installments very nearly put the reader to sleep as there does not seem to be any theme or plot to the overall novel.  Instead of non-stop adventure, I sense nothing but middle-aged angst in the form of philosophical questions. Here's a typical one paraphrased from Jamie--who is ironically described often as the colonies' answer to the universal Scots laird, instilling all around him with that legendary sense of loyalty and safety attributed to any great leader while equipped with an elephantine anatomy that any woman would lust after---&quot;after Claire stops her monthly bleeding, will she still want me in her bed?&quot;  This middle aged nonsense is not reserved for just the middle aged, the book's other primary couple, 20-something Breanna and Roger, ask themselves similar relationship-destroying queries. For what purpose?  None, that I can see, except as filler.  Simply put, Ms Gabaldon's technique of writing parallel stories and then stringing them together like pearls on a string works only when the pearls are of different sizes and quality.  Every little episode related in this huge novel is likened to a small pearl with little value; the necklace produced is mediocre, a mere ornamentation that could have been something much more.<br />After waiting over two years for this sequel to be published, I must say plainly that I am disappointed.  I wondered briefly if that within those two years my reading tastes had matured just a bit and that what I thought fresh, interesting and page-turning prior to this had soured with over-exposure. But, I don't think this is the case, I have come to the conclusion that a 5th book was needed to stretch out the timeline and that the &quot;real&quot; meat of the Jamie and Claire saga will be offered up properly in the last and final book.<br />Instead of buying and reading &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;, I suggest refreshing your mind by rereading the first three books and perhaps the fourth if time permits.  Keeping account of all those characters and their positionings in the plot requires expert bookkeeping skills that sadly dull after waiting two long years!f different sizes and quality.

Mary Stewart's knack of taking an ordinary person and placing her in extraordinary circumstances works extremely well in this story of Camilla Haven's vacation to the Greek mainland.  Camilla's desire to see the oracle city of Delphi is suddenly facilitated by the appearance of an already-paid-for rental car delivered to her complete with keys as she sits contemplating her boring existence in a cafe on Onomia Square in the heart of Athens.  Even though she is not &quot;Simon's girl&quot; --- the person the car is intended for ---- she inpulsively takes the keys and rides off to the fabled city of her daydreams fully intending to meet up with Simon and deliver the car with her apologies.  Instead she is drawn into the very personal pilgrimage of a man visiting his brother Michael's grave in a rough and foreign land.  Here, on the wild and craggy foothills surrounding Mount Parnassus, the thorny history of Greece meets the present as a mystery surrounding Michael's death is brought to the surface through an earthquake of events in which Camilla finds herself fully entrenched.<br />As with all of Mary Stewart's novels, setting is a character in itself.  The descriptions of the wild countryside, lush with wildflowers, yet harsh with both the climate and history transports the reader to the world of the narrator in a fully empathic manner where one actually experiences the book with all five senses.<br />This is a perfect story from start to finish--highly recommended.	2002-01-06

As in their earlier offerings, \\"Relic\\" and its sequel \\"Reliquary\\", the author's mesh together an eclectic cast of characters that flirt not only with archetypical evil in the form of a dark quasi-human, supernatural threat to their very lives, but with their own character flaws of greed and lust for immortality.  Readers of \\"Relic\\" and \\"Reliquary\\" will be immensely pleased at the reappearance of journalist Bill Switchback--the quintessential Manhattanite-- riding an efficient albeit comedic horseback through the mesas of Utah's Badlands. The factual accounting of what actually transpires during a painstaking museum/institute field trip interjected with today's scientific data-gathering and technological procedures keeps the reader rooted in reality as the tale unfolds and the discoveries become more fantastic.  This novel rates as an ultimate adventure tale, told in the same genre as Jurassic Park--it has the same elements that will entice the imagination as well as enough scientific fact to sway even the most doubting Thomas. I recommend this novel to anyone who mind journeys to Atlantis and Troy...anyone who enjoys a hearty blend of mythology with reality.	2002-01-04

At first, Jack thinks the whole premise is crazy, yet he attempts the exercises in the manual on a whim, finding himself drawn not only into a confused state of mind but into his father's macabre world where murder and manipulation reign.<br />The story's dual settings in Chicago and Rome embues the taut little plot with an ambiance both new and old which reflects the author's combination of an everyday somber reality to an edgy feral mythology.  Jack's attraction to his previously unknown half-sister adds a raw frustration to the the drama as well as depth to his middle-age desperation.<br />While I cannot say that I thought this novel had the most satisfying ending, I did find the reading of it enjoyable enough to recommend.  References made to ancient Roman practices and their Indigo/Invisibility-related symbolism should have been better explained although the supernatural implications were enough to keep me entertained.	2001-12-29
US	53093124	R34JUMLHIW3VF2	0671024817	332301994	Wither	Books	3	2	4	N	Y	Wicked Read	When university student Wendy Ward, dabbles in some harmless white magic, she inadvertantly channels an old evil which has lived in her New England college town for over three hundred years.  Through a series of unrelenting dreams,  Wendy, her English comp. professor, Karen Glazer, and eight-year-old, Abby MacNeil parallel the lives of three women of the late 18th century--three women who were accused and executed as witches.  As the town prepares for its annual Hallowe'en parade and celebration, the witches reawaken and pass from the realm of dreams to a dark and horrific reality. The three channelers realize their very lives and the very life of the town are at stake and that something more than a little white magic must be utilized to rid the town of the curse of the three witches.<br />In spite of the predictability of the ending and the rather disgusting (almost comedic) mental apparition the description of the witches fixes in the mind of the reader, I still enjoyed this fast-paced, easy-to-read horror offering.  I recommend it to those who enjoy a light, fun read with no ambiguous symbolism or hidden messages. Not on the Stephen King level of good versus evil.	2001-12-29
US	53093124	R2EGL3Y837WYXP	0679727779	300224609	Sleeping in Flame	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Fairytale Destiny	Actor Walker Easterling has a unique origin--and you'll never &quot;guess&quot; what it is until you immerse yourself into this thoroughly enjoyable albeit quirky read.  In a style reminiscient of Graham Joyce, the author begins Walker's strange revelation with a single life-altering action; he dramatically rescues model-beautiful Maris from an abusive boyfriend.  As his act of chivalry blooms into love against the romantic backdrop of Vienna, counter-productive events inhibit the relationship from reaching the &quot;happy-ever-after&quot; stage. Indeed the deepening of Maris and Walker's love for each other corresponds directly to Walker's awakening to a supernatural power which he discovers he has carried with him through a series of past-lives.  Intrinsic to all these lives is the same element, a strong father-son bond broken by the love of a beautiful woman, but as Walker never knew his &quot;real&quot; father, he is puzzled as to how the story will play out in the life he is living now.<br />With no strain to the reader's sensibilites, Carroll easily moves his story along like a cameraman flashing in and out of reality and dream sequences. Its one fault, perhaps is Walker's eventual reckoning with his past and confrontation with the father figure---the simplicity of the solution seemed a little convenient.  In its defense however, it works with the overall theme and mood of the piece.  Although the reader figures out ahead of time most of what Walker will finally confirm for himself as his powers of perception and magic strengthen, the strength of the book lies in the charmingly jumpy way Carroll tells his story and the utter insouciance of both his main characters.<br />All in all this was a very pleasant read that I looked forward to picking up and was reluctant to put down.	2001-12-26

As luck would have it, I noticed a hardcover copy of &quot;Dark Sister&quot; on a sale rack in my local bookseller and due to its extremely low price, and my inability to resist a bargain, I picked it up. I finished the story within the span of a day, so enthralling was it; I literally could not put it down!<br />The story has a quick pace which gets right to the point on page one. Once Maggie, Alex and their children find an old diary wedged within a hole in their fireplace, their lives change radically.  Due to the content of the book, Maggie becomes increasingly involved in herblore.  As she finds that her simple charms and ointments are effective, she careens into a further unbounded study into the Wiccan craft involving a local herb dealer and a strange old woman.  Maggie discovers a surprising power within herself but is unaware that simultaneously, she is unleashing a malevolent force that threatens her own children.  Underlying this main plot is the psychological unraveling of Maggie and Alex's relationship, reflected expertly through the mirror of their son Sam's deteriorating behavior. Joyce's skillful alloying of science, psychology and the occult hallmarks the story with a good solid satisfying climax that resolves the characters' plights, and yet manages to leave the reader still tingling with the magical and supernatural implications which linger in the air like a crackle of static energy and imprint on the mind with a flash of color like the aurora bourealis long after the book has been closed and placed on the shelf.	2001-12-12

Ever since I read Du Maurier's &quot;Rebecca&quot; as a young girl, I fantasized about the vivid character of Rebecca, who never makes a physical appearance throughout the whole story, yet manages to drive the action of all the players.  Having glimpsed her essence, I wondered about her motivation--her real motivation--not the prejudiced opinions gleaned from the other characters.  What had brought this glamorous female graced with &quot;brains, beauty and breeding&quot; to her less than glorious end at the murdering hand of her own supposedly smitten husband?  How had her childhood injected her with the concentrated need to be mistress of Manderley?<br />If you are expecting all the answers from Sally Beauman's novel, &quot;Rebecca's Tale&quot;, look elsewhere. Rather than a straight-forward account of Rebecca's story in Rebecca's voice, we get instead---in an attempt by the author to utilize Du Maurier's masterful yet underhanded heresay approach to uncovering Manderley's secrets, another go at more opinions--and these from two characters who were not even in Du Maurier's classic and do little to elicit sympathy or interest from the reader. Divided into four sections (each narrated by a different voice), the plot centers around the appearance of Terence Grey to the Manderley district.  For very personal reasons, Grey is stirring up the old scandal/drama of the first book in order to seek some thread of the elusive Rebecca.  Chief on his list of interviewees is Colonel Julyan, now a man in his 70s and his daughter, Ellie.  Paramount to Grey's scheme to weed out the truth is the delivery of an old notebook seemingly written in Rebecca's own hand.<br />So, Rebecca does indeed get to speak, but through a diary written towards the end of her life to her unborn child.  Even the information found here is questionable as Rebecca is touted as liar and performer who will say what she will to get what she wants.  The &quot;why&quot; is still seeped in mystery and Rebecca sadly remains a shadowy image like film that has not quite been developed.<br />Ultimately, this lack of substance disappoints even though for the most part the story itself could be compelling if it left out the annoying angst of Ellie's feminism, Julyan's guilt and Grey's inability to be true to himself.  Such &quot;modern&quot; &quot;politically correct&quot; dilemmas, have no place in a period piece set in the early 50s. Yes, all the &quot;live&quot; players' issues are resolved, but these events, while tying up the plot's loose ends again do not quite work within the context of discovering the real Rebecca.<br />On the positive side, Beauman does a wonderful job of weaving her rather labyrinthine tale with the use of the four distinct voices. Her tone works well in conveying the misty Cornwall coast as it carries with it that unsure quality that Du Maurier adopted initially while allowing the young and inexperienced second Mrs. De Winter to meander through her daydreams while dealing with the testy events of her story.  Also interesting is the premise of Rebecca's childhood as related through the journal, even though again this is not developed to its full potential, but rather takes the easy way out by remaining slightly elusive.  The appearance at the end of the second Mrs. DeWinter seemed too convenient; her characterization was silly--after living through the events of all three Manderley related tales (yes, the plot and outcome of Susan Hill's &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot; is also incorporated into this story)there is no way this woman could remain so gauche.<br />As the Du Maurier estate has sanctioned this book as a sequel, I recommend reading it to all of you who hold &quot;Rebecca&quot; dear as one of the great Gothic masterpieces of the 20th century.

At a mere 96 pages, it cannot be pigeon-holed as a novel of romantic suspense as Ms Stewart's other works.  There is no grand mystery---no one tottering between life and death.  However it contains all the other elements of the Mary Stewart novel in all its three-dimensional glory: a lovely Englishwoman, an exotic locale,and the quintessential hero, reeking of intrepid British charm.  Here 23-year-old Perdita West is assistant to older whimisical Cora Gresham,a children's author.  Research for a new book brings them both to Lanzarote, a volcanic island in the Canary archipelago where legend has it that two young lovers eloped during a night when the wind off the north cape brought with it the gas and ash from a volcanic eruption. The fabled couple was never seen again.  Perdita is entranced with the story, particularly as she is attracted to Cora's son, Michael.  As Perdita and Michael explore their mutual affection, their ultimate adventure parallels that of the legendary lovers and Perdita discovers that it matters naught whether love lasts forever or just for a matter of seconds.  As in her other novels,  Ms Stewart's descriptive gifts sparkle as they bring to life the paradise of Lanzarote with prose that is almost poetic in its cadence.  If one was to consider Ms Stewart's other works as a lush and textured bouquet consisting of large jungle blossoms, this slim volume would be likened to one perfect rose. Look for it!	2001-12-05

This story does not conjur up half the magic of Bradley's masterpiece, but it does satisfactorily probe some of that primordial mystery that shrouds the ancient world and its people.  In this tale, unhappy adolescent Adam spends most of his time on the hillside where the Celtic stone from another century proudly stands. Little does he know, but the stone is a gateway to another time, a time where Druid Priestess-in-training, Brid, is able to pass from her time, the 6th century into the far future---Adam's time in the 20th century.  At first he views the vivacious Brid as a marvelous playmate, but when she initiates him into the pleasures of sexual love, he is smitten--at least for while.  As Adam matures, he leaves his home village and sad childhood to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor.  His life moves onto other women, marriage and children of his own.  However, Brid does not move on, she is still the young and beautiful Druidess who defies her family and her religious traditions to pursue Alan across the boundaries of time.  Her obsession is all-encompassing; she lets nothing stop her from getting back into Alan's life and to control him in the only way she can--in his bed. Brid's melancholy and frustration is uniquely portrayed by Erskine--indeed it permeates the tone of the entire story.<br />Ms Erskine is surely the master of the obsessive tale; the reader while finding Brid somewhat annoying after plaguing Alain for over 50 years, can understand her bewilderment over aging Alan's puzzling behavior when defending his frazzled family from her, and commiserate with both their mutual attraction for one another and Alan's disgust with himself as he falls prey over and over again to Brid's charms.  After three generarions of daunting pursuit and umpteen pages, it is to the reader's great relief that with the help of a powerful present day druid and Alan's grandchild, Brid's claim on Alan can finally be loosened and Brid's own immortal soul released from her uncle's grasp.<br />Although I enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down, I must say I enjoyed Erskine's earlier works much more.  In particular, &quot;House of Shadows&quot; certainly pricked those tiny hairs off the back of my neck!  Even so, &quot;On the Edge of Darkness&quot; succeeds in eliciting sometimes fright-fraught emotions for both protagonists---even if these emotions are a bit disturbing----which stay with the reader after the book has been closed and put down.f that with the help of a powerful present day druid and Alan's grandchild, Brid's claim on Alan can finally be loosened and Brid's own immortal soul released from her uncle's grasp.  <BR>Although I enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down, I must say I enjoyed Erskine's earlier works much more.

Those who have never used a pastry bag, need not panic; the results are well-worth the process.  The recipes are fun and fantastic, the tastes, subtle and the step-by-step directions, complete with Pierre's sidebar tips and suggestions, foolproof.  The book is divided into different sections focusing on Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, Custards/Mousses, Truffles/Candies, Ice Cream/Frozen Desserts, Hot and Cold Drinks.  The book is prefaced by a brief essay on what you can expect from the book and finished to perfection with Pierre's base recipes and a dictionary of terms, techniques, equipment and ingredients with a source guide.  I especially enjoyed concocting Pierre's Chocolate Macaroons, the Financiers, and the Moist and Nutty Brownies.  The total chocolate experience of  the Original Hot Chocolate is Proustian, (with or without the madeleine)reminiscient of that served in a Parisian specialty shop in a tiny cup.

With her usual flare and ease, Kearsley introduces us to an odd combination of guests/inhabitants in an isolated setting that is reminiscent of that of Mary Stewart's in her novel, &#34;Wildfire at Midnight&#34;.  Among the cast of well-drawn characters are the two &#34;hunted&#34; men, James and Gareth, who provide some provocative mind-candy for the female readers and Elen, the fanciful young mother who is certain that her baby is &#34;Named of the Dragon&#34; in the Arthurian sense and claims that Lyn has arrived in role of her baby's protector.  Of course, this proves unsettling to poor Lyn who plunging headlong into her own memories of the loss of her own child, must finally face her demons as she unravels the mystery surrounding the threat to Elen's child.  The mystical Arthurian themes as well as the reclusive personalities of the more shadowy characters in this story add to the rather misty ambiance and act as an enjoyable foil to Lyn's reemergence into the light of life. Great story with a fantastic setting which I heartily recommend.<br />I listened to the audio book version of this novel; the reader, Jill Tanner, has a very prim older voice which I didn't think fit the character very well.  Tanner does do justice to the male characters and her portrayal of Bridget works to perfection.  Nonetheless, I think a younger voice might be in order . . .	2001-11-30

Yet, from the very first moment she sees the fabled chateau and senses its evocative magic, she slightly lets down her guard, becoming slowly embroiled in the events surrounding a recent murder in the village and the corresponding intrigues of her fellow vacationers at the lovely Hotel de France. As her romantic sensibilities had been dampened by her parents' divorce and now are reinforced by her cousin's no-show, Emily unsuccessfully attempts to stay neutral to the obvious charms of the setting as embodied by the handsome French vineyard owner and the German violinist with the rock star ambiance. Only when she realizes that Harry's delayed appearance has something to do with the murdered man, and she unintentionally jeopardizes the life of one of the young tourists at the hotel by confiding her ruminations, does the story quickly wind down to a satisfactory conclusion.<br />Kearsley weaves her story with the history of Chinon and adds some supernatural occurances to further alloy the magical tone of the tale with reality.  Emily is a belivable heroine, crafted in the Mary Stewart genre of not quite damsel in distress, but rather the innocent tourist who unwittingly backs into a situation she cannot totally control.  The beautiful setting, the handsome collection of men, the alluring music and olifactory descriptions of Chinon embue the book with a sensory lushness which is as delightful to experience as devouring a gourmet dark chocolate truffle.<br />I did not find the book overly predictable.  Perhaps, I knew from the middle on with whom Emily ultimately would find favor, but even this did not detract from the overall pleasure derived from the reading as I was torn between not being able to put it down and not finishing it too quickly.<br />I look forward to Ms Kearsley's other offerings in the future and hope that her first two books, &quot;The Gemini Game&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; will be reissued.ope that her first two books, &quot;The Gemini Game&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; will be reissued.	2001-11-30

Here fledgling actress, Celia Sands bears the same name as the infamous lover of famous Italian lake district playwright Galeazzo D'Ascanio of the early 1900s. . . and now seemingly serendipitiously she is chosen by the deliciously understated Alessandro D'Ascanio, grandson of the famous playwright, to actually perform the lead in a recently discovered but unknown and unperformed masterpiece written by his grandfather especially for that first Celia.  Upon arriving at Il Piacere in Italy, our heroine is initially fraught with many emotions, many of which stem from her fear of failure in the distinguished company of other cast and crew members.  She must cope with the bald fact that legendary actress Madeleine Hedrick is playing one of the other leads and that the selfish actions of her own actress mother caused Hedrick's marital breakup. With regret, she notices that Hedrick's newest relationship with a younger man, the third actor, eerily parallels the action of the play itself-- the older woman thrown aside for a younger lover. And this is not the only coincidence, for as the actors prepare for that first performance, other mysterious incidents surrounding the play come under the scrutiny of a light from the past which floods the future of the inhabitants of Il Piacere, placing them in the wake of imminent danger.<br />Kearsley seems to have discovered that knack for combining a luscious setting, a questioning damsel in distress,  and a contained mystery with a smorgasbord of tasty male morsels to create a tantalizing reading experience in the worthy tradition of Mary Stewart.	2001-11-30

With his no-nonsense brand of legerdemain, King introduces the reader to a townful of quarky individuals with deep dark needs wedged not too deeply within each of their psyche.  When villian Leland Gaunt opens his shop, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, he teases each of Castle Rock's good neighbors' desires to the surface by waving under their respective noses just the right object symbolic of some unfulfilled emotion.  He doesn't ask for much in return---a paultry amount of money and the performance of a little prank played on a specified yet unsuspecting neighbor.  In a little over a week, the town is duking it out with Gaunt rubbing his hands in anticipation and Sheriff Pangborn blinking in disbelief.<br />From the start the reader knows that Gaunt embodies evil and his intentions are not to please but to achieve Castle Rock's swift destruction.  However, I don't think the genius of this tale lies within its plot, but rather in the way King makes you salivate over each citizen's downfall while probing within to determine which 'Needful Thing' Leland Gaunt would use to entice and destroy the actual reader. His simple style deceives us into believing that we have &quot;already heard this one&quot; and then as we feel his well-crafted trap clench one leg, he scares the living daylights out of us as we realize the monster we fear the most is growling within our closest closet.<br />I listened to an unabridged audiobook version of this book on a long car trip and found King's kinky prose fun and focusable. Hence, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a classic story of the battle between good and evil peppered generously with a good sense of humor.	2001-11-30

She does it well.  Never once when reading this story about a savvy young Londoner who chucks her enervating city life for one in a small village, did I think Julia's decision a foolish one or fathom Ms Kearsley's telling of it silly.  On the contrary, I found Julia's flashbacks engrossing, enjoying thoroughly Kearsley's meshing of the past and present as well as my own attempts to correctly match the past souls with the present bodies.  The hypothesis of the old house retaining the passion of a past event is one that reoccurs in some of Barbara Erskine's novels, particularly &quot;House of Shadows&quot;. While Ms Erskine dwells mainly on the supernatural, Ms Kearsley, more satisfactorily uses the metaphysical elements of her story to heighten the romance. Don't hestitate to pick up a copy of this Catherine Cookson Fiction Prize winner; it certainly is well done and worth your time if you favor a good story interjected with realistic romance!	2001-11-30

She's run away from the horrid memories of her marriage and her husband Alex's death all the way from America to romantic Ireland and seemingly into the arms of handsome Braedon.  Too bad Braedon doesn't trust her, thinking she and Alex have knowingly defrauded his art galleries by swapping masterpieces for cleverly forged imitations. Ironically, a seemingly coincidental sequence of accidents where Kacy is the victim lead Braedon to question his own premise and to eventually sympathize with her own innocent betrayal.<br /><br />Does this sound like the stuff romantic suspense is made of?  Definitely.  However, for some reason along the way, the story becomes predictable.  As readers and lovers of romantic suspense, we know that according to the formulaic result, Braedon and Kacy are going to find happiness together yet for some reason in this equation, we don't care. Kacy is too pre-Raphaelic angelical and Braedon is too Pierce Brosnan.  With such perfection, their little hangups seem just that, little and inconsequential.  The theme of trust and its counterpart are overplayed; there is too much doubt in the minds of both participants even though they seek release in each other's arms.  (The love scenes, by the way, are overcontrived.  I felt as if they were requested by the publisher in order to attract a certain type of reader.) I won't spoil the ending for the dedicated reader of Ms. Davis' work, but in my opinion it is overused---soap opera-ish----and does not even work in a novel where the main objective should be solely the reader's pleasure.	2001-11-17

Her heroine Verity is fresh, a real 21st century woman with a real career, tangible hopes and dreams for the future and best of all her hang-ups are believable giving motivation to her actions and introspections in the course of the novel.  The setting is gothic in its unsettling unconventionality.  One meets the other players immediately as one would meet aquaintances at a luncheon.  The reader is presented with the characters and left to draw his or her own conclusions; there is no excessive ponderings voiced sotto voce by the narrator.  The men are real men and I found myself intrigued by the nuances in their dispostions in the way I had been charmed long ago by the bantering between the lead female and male in Victoria Holt's major offerings.  The romantic attraction between the main characters is fun and piquant; I found myself rereading certain passages to thrill again at the wordplay.  The supernatural note adds a realistic New Age spice that gets beyond the usual Thornfield scenario with the old house and its imposing secrets.  All in all, I found &quot;The Shadowy Horses&quot; a great read and as close to the old masters, Mary Stewart and Victoria Holt as any author could hope to get.  I look forward to reading Kearsley's next publications and hope that &quot;The Gemini Game&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; is reissued/republished in the United States.	2001-11-17

Listening to &quot;the Weight of Water&quot; on audio cassette was akin to experiencing a friend's apprehension and uncertainty about her marriage by hearing her speak in installments over coffee at Starbucks. The reader, like any good friend wants to help, but is disappointed as the book draws to its climax and then its close with little hope for the future.<br /><br />In this first tale (I believe the story of Thomas is picked up again in another Shreve offering), Jean is married to Thomas, a famous poet with an eye for beauty.  Together they share a good life epitomized by their young five year old daughter, Billie.  As a photographer Jean has been commissioned to take professional shots of a famous century-old murder site on an isolated island off the coast of New England.  Immediately, Jean notices Thomas's 'eye' widening when he meets his brother's comely girlfriend onboard his brother's boat which has been commissioned to ferry the little family about the Maine coast during the project. She turns inward, simultaneously researching the murders to get a feel for the location and the memories and events in her marriage in an effort to buoy her own helplessness.  When Jean stumbles upon the diary of an immigrant Norwegian woman who was an eyewitness, she finds that her own inherent unhappiness was paralleled by the events in this long-dead woman's lonely life.  The unmitigated dread sensed throughout the novel unfortunately will be physically manifested in a horrifying manner which equals that of the older tragedy.  Jean's &quot;good life&quot; ends abruptly and starkly with a gut-wrenching sucker-punch reality that leaves the reader numb with shock and cold as if plunged into that cold Atlantic sea.<br /><br />All of Ms Shreve's heroines seem to be starting off with less than zero.  None of them are particularly happy; their marriages are not the culmination of carefree courtships and in this regard are doomed from the start to fail on some level.  I get the sense after reading three of Shreve's novels that this is the author's depiction of life:  sequences of events that move along on a subterranean level with the certainty of minutes filling an hour, but with no effervescent hope for any of life's highs.ships and in this regard are doomed from the start to fail on some level.

We feel Kathyrn's shock, her pain.  We move into her memories easily through the conduit of Ms Shreve's simple fluid language and sense her growing, albeit bewildered anger as she realizes that the man she was married to was more a stranger than the man she built her life around for more than a decade.<br /><br />I will not spoil the story for anyone, but I will recommend it.  I ask that as Ms Shreve enjoys setting her tales in the same New England location and tying them together with the mention of characters from her other novels, that she consider writing a sequel to this one, where the main character is Maddie, Jack and Kathyrn's daughter and the plot revolves around her eventual awareness and subsequent meeting of Deidre and Dermot.	2001-11-16

I was prepared for a cutthroat struggle between good and evil.  The material presented in the book, however is so much more multi-layered than the movie, it is almost a crime to allow the movie to have the same title.<br /><br />Like the movie, the story revolves around the bond between Maggie and her granddaughter, Cody. Severed by the child's abduction by her mother and her new spouse, the bond triggers past life experiences to both Maggie and the child. Distraught, when she discovers that her daughter's spouse is the head of a Satanic cult and is going to use the child for some nefarious purpose,  Maggie seeks help wherever she can find it, and an eclectic posse of assistants does she amass: a former cult member, an adept in the occult, a confused Catholic priest, a love-sick police detective, and a wise martial arts sensei.<br />As Maggie strengthens herself spiritually for the task ahead, we the readers are privledged to share in her enlightenment without any affront to our own beliefs.  All the great mysteries are touched upon and Ms. Spellman knowingly provides a collection of reading material at the end of the novel for those interested in furthering their own spiritual quests.<br /><br />A very satisfying junket from start to finish--would love to read a sequel which would reveal Cody's mature abilities.	2001-11-16

Covert agent discovers after being retired that he had been working for the wrong side all along.  Enraged, he wants revenge, but finds he has been sentenced to death by whom?  He isn't sure, but he sure knows how to duck trouble as he races from one bad position to another around the globe. The reader expects this pace to continue to the end.  Unfortunately, it does not.  About two thirds of the way through, the novel just dies.  Seemingly important characters are just abandoned, and others which had little mention or priority seem to be reintroduced into major roles.  The climax is tired with the big showy blast of a movie-of-the-week's stuntman's special effects.<br /><br />Rather than read this, I recommend one of the earlier works for which Ludlum is famous:  The Bourne Identity, The Osterman Weekend, The Rhineman Exchange, to name a few.	2001-11-16

Big mistake.  As I read Hannah's remembrances regarding her first love experience and her chilling introduction to a lingering malevolence residing in her summer residence, I found my eyes searching through the shadows in the corners of my bedroom for something other than dust bunnies.<br /><br />Gutcheon's clever narrative allows the lightness and hopefullness of first love to temporarily scour out the darkness of the house's past.  As readers, we are intrigued by the mystery, we want to know the full anatomy of the murder and we are fooled into thinking even though we know Hannah's story somehow ends in tragedy that the echoes of the past will reverberate through her life then and now.<br /><br />The author makes use of a parallel story line, similar to the technique Anita Shreve uses in \\"[[ASIN:B004SI66QM The Weight of Water By Anita Shreve]].\\"  As each chapter alternates, we discover in small increments the story of the two woman in different time periods and realize along with Hannah, just a little too late, that the older evil has somehow permeated her bid for that special happiness with Conary for which we all wish, but are sometimes denied.<br /><br />Recommended with sufficient warning to read in daylight only. . . or if so desired as I did in a still house after midnight for a delicious fright.<br /><br />Bottom Line? As I always recommend this book as a memorable ghost story,  I decided to revisit it just this week (September 2013) to rediscover why I found it so compelling.  Unfortunately I, jaded reader that I have become, did not find it to be as strong a story when not read in the wee hours.  Indeed, Gutcheon does a fine job of depicting the euphoria of first love.  However, her ghost story, while somewhat disturbing is not as mesmerizing as Shreve's Weight of Water--Gutcheon's phantom fades in its ability to frighten in the light of day.  The reverberations of the earlier time do shatter the happiness of main character and narrator Hannah, but the motives of the ghost are not fully explained inasmuch as the incident with Conary is the spirit's one crucial and terrible example of brutal interference--there is no other real incidence in the history of the town that supports the ghost's actions.  Random?  Bad luck?  Why Conary? The author does not explain.  Rather than a haunting, \\"More Than You Know\\" is more a novel of regrets--the regret of Claris for her uninformed and hopeful choice and that of Hannah who never fully enjoyed the love of her life.

Our narrator is a deliciously innocent, well-meaning and attractive vacationer, Nicola Ferris, (don't think perky Hayley Mills who in the movie of the same name was a burgeoning adolescent--this Nicola is a consummate situation-manager with a mission, accustomed to controlling her life and the people around her)who in refusing to back out of an affair she unwittingly steps into, discovers the one situation she cannot manage without help.  It takes the handsome stranger, in the guise of competent English tourist Mark Langley (yes, a young Peter McEnery might come to mind,) to turn the tables on her while pressing her into a less dominant role that she finds she actually likes.  Mark's teenaged brother, the kidnapped Colin and his clever forays into the stranger world of British slang, provides an effective comedic foil for the straight-laced Mark and his Greek counterpart, the Englishly-challenged caique-owner, Lambis.  The insiduous-pallikarathes villan, Stratos, one part charm to two parts unstable lethal weapon, the slithering eel-like Tony, and sadly-complaisant, hard-working Sofia, round up the players along with Nicola's older but wiser cousin, Frances.<br /> Don't miss this one--the prose alone will have you chucking your stalward life and buying a Greek wildflower guide along with a one-way ticket to Crete!one-way ticket to Crete!	2001-11-16

The story races along with the same breathless apprehension of an adrenaline saturated bloodstream; the reader reads quickly wanting more, moving from chapter to chapter happily engrossed on the moment's focus until sadly the ending is reached too soon and the entire experience is over.<br /><br />For this sensation, I commend the author. However, the satisfaction I garnered from the story fell short.  Although the plot and its twists were worked out to an almost mathematical satisfaction, I found that for the most part the actions of the  characters did not make much sense.  The heroine's insistant blundering into the life of the child and his questionable family could not be attributed just to her famous father's lack of attention.  Her childhood problems are mentioned by the author, but never fully explored; I suppose the relaying of this information is meant to provide motivation, but I did not think it explained the heroine, Christine's perilous and seemingly thoughtless activities.  Someone burdened with the black-hole-absence of a parent's nurturing would not necessarily be so clear and insightful when working through the Herculean chore of distinguishing truth from falsehood as analytically as Christine manages to do.  I also think that in as much as the author wanted to conjur up the same magical experience combining danger and romance that were Mary Stewart's trademark, she forgot that her heroine was not the late 50s, early 60s narrator from the post WW2 United Kingdom. With this in mind, I do not think that any modern 21st century woman would invite herself to the home of a virtual stranger--indeed a stranger with the label \\"playboy\\" and not expect \\"other\\" consequences.  Ms. Nikas needs to remember that the Stewart heroine stumbles onto things, she doesn't force her way in with a crowbar.  Perhaps for this new century, the old formula needs to be altered a little.  What worked for Stewart worked for Stewart.  What works for other authors of this genre needs to be tweaked and played with by them to make their stories as fully satisfying as those by Stewart. \\"The Divided Child\\" needs a bit of massaging to make it a fully believable, memorable and delectable experience.<br /><br />Nevertheless the book is far better than others of its kind; the author has done a fine job of recreating the same \\"Stewart\\" excitement and I look forward to her next offering.t force her way in with a crowbar.

The last &quot;telling&quot; brought the reader to the episode where nine year old Morgan, Gorlais's daughter, has attempted to kill her infant brother, Arthur, and Uther, Arthur's father has imprisoned her in a nunnery on Tintagel island for life.  This next installment is told in the voice of Luned, whom we first encounter as a young farm girl who thirsts for more than just the typical life of a country female.  When she encounters a traveling Christian priest, she is tantilized by the life of learning she could have as a Christian nun, and dreaming of great libraries of books, she follows him to the convent on Tintagel island.  The reader is intrigued by Luned's intrepid quest for learning, and we share her disappointment as her first assignment at the convent stronghold is the manual labor of feeding the convent farm animals .  As in all such stories, her tenacity reaps its reward for eventually she rises in the convent hierarchy. We applaud her acumen for business and nod at her shrewdness as it shines most noticeably in her dealings with the convent's commercial traders. Happily we watch as the Mother Superior takes Luned under her wing and we become aware that most likely our intense narrator may very well be the convent leader's heir apparent.<br /><br />However, this is a story with no happy ending.  Rather, it is a morality tale where Luned's great ambition and pride are punished.  When Morgan is installed at the convent and put in Luned's charge, we hold our breath each and every time Luned's feeble attempts at controlling the girl's actions and affections backfire.

Wise Woman's Telling is the first book in the Daughter of Tintagel Series about Morgan Le Fey.  As I have only read this first book, I will reserve judgement on the entire series as I do not know the outcome.<br /> This particular book tells the story of Uther, Merlin, Gorlois, Ygrene and the begetting of the baby, Arthur, in the voice of Ygrene's childhood nurse, Gwennol, a wise woman of the old religion.  As in the &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot;, Fay Sampson faces off the old religion's spells and magic , utilized by Ygrene and her daughters, Elaine, and Morgawse, with the stifling foothold that Christianity gained in Britain during that time period.<br /> Only 9 year old Morgan is not schooled in the old religion's  art as Gwennol senses something powerful and dangerous in Morgan and thinks it wise not to teach her things she will only use in a destructive way.  The child Morgan craves attention from her soldier father; unlike her sisters, she wishes to be a man, and ride off into battle. Most of the time, the egotistial Gorlois throws off her wild embraces, paying more attention to the begetting of his beautiful wife with a male heir.  The author does a fine job of relaying the underlying tension that drives Morgan; she of all the characters remains loyal to her father, Gorlois, after his death.  Although she is, for the most part, a silent participant in the story's drama, the reader senses the child's need for vengenance without constantly being reminded of it.<br />  Ygrene is portrayed as a vain woman with the goal of queenship uppermost in her mind; a goal in which she uses witchcraft to obtain.  Morgawse is an over-sexed adolescent which the narrator feels should be married immediately.  Uther is a robust king with more joy in him than his predecessor Gorlois.<br />  Most fasinating of all, is Sampson's portrayal of Merlin.  From the start our 'wise woman' senses his power and is rightfully afraid of it.  When they finally come face to face, Gwennol's wish is that she is a few years younger so that she and the druid could go off together.<br /> This story has its moments, but for the most part it does not contain the magic of the Marion Zimmer Bradley story.  However, as I obtain and read the succeeding books of &quot;Daughter of Tintagel&quot;, I will comment further on the story as a whole.t she is a few years younger so that she and the druid could go off together.  <BR> This story has its moments, but for the most part it does not contain the magic of the Marion Zimmer Bradley story.

It seems to be typical of a particular genre where all the characters are rich and famous and wear only the best labeled clothing.  The women are all glamourous, the men, model handsome.<br /> This book caught my attention because its setting was the Cornwall of Daphne Du Maurier and supposedly its premise was similar to that of Du Maurier's great romantic classics.  This could not be further from the truth.  The characters in &quot;A Cottage by the Sea&quot; are utterly vacuous parodies; the time travel sequence is ridiculously unbelievable.<br /> Instead of wasting your time and money on this book, pick up copies of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Frenchman's Creek&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; and the &quot;Scapegoat&quot;; even if you've already read them, you will get more out of a repeat read than a first go at this.  If you love time travel, try the Gabaldon Outlander series; although there are some improbable situations in these stories, at least they are entertaining as well as well-written with real characters who laugh, cry and speak as we do.	2001-08-09

Her husband has died and her large house in the city has ceased to be of use to her.  Her plan is to purchase a small cottage near her pregnant granddaughter.  Her logic is quite simple, but the series of events that follow lead Nina back into her own past where as a young woman she made a mistake that changed her entire life.<br /> The 'Toll House' of the title is the cottage that Nina eventually buys and through which she eventually discovers the truth.  Within it she discovers an old book which relates a period in the history of the house during the 18th century when the house was actually a toll station for the toll road.  The lives of the house's former inhabitants strangely mirror Nina's own.<br /> The book is full of interesting characters; there are gypsies, a cult, squatters, real estate agents, village busy bodies, and of course, Nina and her family, past and present.&lt;br. There are some loose ends, but somehow the resolution is satisfying enough to cause the reader to overlook them.	2001-08-09

The book ends with heartache tinged with hope. Ms. Simons, such passionate characters must be reunitied in some way, shape or form! Readers, if you like Diana Gabaldon's way with Jamie and Claire in her Outlander series, you will enjoy the intensity of feeling that Paullina Simons manages to evoke with her characters, Shura and Tania.  From the very start of their relationship, I could not help but reminisce my own first love, so well drawn were the feelings both characters experience and express. The ending of the book was a bit improbable. .  Tania's proclivity for ingenious sexual games for one so innocent was reminiscent of Ayla's in Auel's four part series, Children of the Earth; her mastery of this aspect of her life, somehow did not jive with her dialogue spoken at the time.

Importantly, cross-cultural notes enlighten one to the  particulars of Arabic culture.

The book is peppered with  phrases, written both in Arabic and phonetically for each of the eighteen  topics.  The topics include matters like 'Health', 'Shopping', 'Hotels',  'Air and Train Travel etc.  and includes an English to Arabic dictionary in  the back.  I rate this book 4 stars only because the version I bought does  not contain the audio cassette.

In this, the fourth Ripley  tale, Ripley, squiring about in his French country manor, still dabbling in  art forgery and living off his father-in-law's largesse, comes across a  sixteen year old male American runaway from a prestigious family, working  as a gardener.  Taking the boy under his wing, he finds he is mysteriously  drawn to him and with good cause: the boy, Frank, like Tom, himself, has  committed murder. Knowing something of Tom's history, the boy seeks him out  for tutelage, sympathy and God knows what else. The relationship develops  as the whirlwind plot detours the reader from the French countryside, to  Paris, to Berlin (for a 70s glimpse at the famous Wall), Hamburg, New York  and Maine, all in that innocent yet insinuating Highsmith style that  immerses one so totaly in Ripley's world. Even the most skeptical reader is  convinced that whatever 'snafus' encountered along the way are par for the  course, must be dealt with in typical Ripley fashion and are not worth a  sleepless night or a second thought. However, while thoroughly enjoying the  reading of this, I found that amidst all the touring, side adventures and  insights into Tom's personality, something else was going on beneath the  surface, something that I didn't quite catch.  Tom's attachment to the boy  is almost sentimental, yet with his particular practicality he is able to  tuck such feelings aside when they are no longer necessary with a coldness  that is reminiscient of the Mongibello Ripley.  The reader is coerced into  believing in Ripley's brighter humanity then ripped away and plunged back  into the darkness of his soulessness.  By the end of the story, we are  again inducted into the cult of Ripley's brand of maleficence.ficence.	2000-02-04

Set in the age of burgeoning feminism, the story is concerned with the survival of  Ellen, wife of James and mother of two, who has been forced to move in with  her austere in-laws.  Little by little she watches her husband revert back  to the insecure and deprived child ridiculed by his crude father and  similarly unenlightened older brother.  The revealed reasons for her  marriage are almost ludicrous, even in this small farming community.  Surely, one protests, there were other options?  As she observes the  decline of her immediate family unit, she stumbles upon the truth behind  her mother-in-law's pathetic dreams and how they impact this dysfunctional  group to the current day of the story.  Her ultimate decision comes as no  surprise, but one wonders how successful she will actually be, set adrift  in a world where she is most definitely not endowed with the necessary  navigational skills.  The primary fault of her characterization is her lack  of involvement.  She &quot;feels&quot;, but does not seem to have the  ability to &quot;do&quot;. She &quot;puts up with&quot; and the author  offers nothing as to the &quot;why&quot; of this other than her frumpy  reliance on the preachings of a 50s rooted Catholic priest and the sense of  moral exactness of her mother and sisters, which, I guess, works  historically but, is not enough psychological proof for the more thoughtful  reader.  What comes easily to her sisters and her mother, even her  vengeful and decisive mother-in-law's mother, seems to be absent from  Ellen's make-up.  And so her 'big' decision seems flawed, conceived and  acted upon by someone much stronger than the weak observer portrayed within  the pages of the book.  On the positive side, Manette's depiction of the  Griers, mother, father and son is truly chilling in its sad realism. The  desperation of James and his cleaving to his parent's sick and destructive  ideologies creates an almost too real picture of the American dream gone  astray. Obviously, this is not a story glorifying the stalwardness of  America's heartland but rather a bleak and ruthless portrait of how one's  unrealistic romanticism draws life's righteous lesson-givers to wreak havoc  on the idealistic and ultimately destroy themselves and everyone else in  the process.nd his cleaving to his parent's sick and destructive  ideologies creates an almost too real picture of the American dream gone  astray.

The old adage that one should not judge a book by its cover could not be a  truer in this instance.  Poor, underprivledged Tom takes his pursuit of the  American dream a little too seriously, yet he manages to pull off  unbelievable and almost unspeakable acts with the finesse and skill of a  master jeweler and the audacity of a veteran politician.  Highsmith's  impressionistic style enables the reader to get into Ripley's all too  calculating mind while viewing his mild mannered sidebars with a droll  aplomb.  The transition from cornered felon to cold murderer flows  unperturbed into one's mind unquestioningly.  Ripley's activities are  deemed acceptable and surprisingly the reader is not shocked.  On the  contrary, one finds oneself rooting for him to dupe or subdue anyone who  gets in his way. Anyone who has seen the 1999 movie offering starring Matt  Damon, will not be satisfied with its director's interpretation of Tom's  motives.  Instead of the cold, enigmatic, amoral, asexual goal-seeker of  the book, the audience is confronted with a flawed nobody who is definitely  less than Highsmith's Ripley.  The movie version is a haunted soul  attracted to homosexuality, buoyed by a yearning for the post WWII dolce  vita of America's privledged class and incensed with the underdog's cowed  yet vengeful need to fight back when shunned and bested by his so-called  betters.  Although the movie is highly entertaining, and Damon's  performance is commendable, Highsmith's Ripley is reduced to what we are  all too familiar with--an unfortunate product of dysfunctional 20th century  life who would benefit greatly from prolonged sessions with the best Park  Avenue psychiatrist, whereas the 'hero' of the book is perfectly happy with  who he is and the decisions he makes to further entrench himself on the  path he has chosen.

It is little wonder that Tess LeGuerre, curious human and daughter of his childhood friend, decides to penetrate it.  The confluence of these  two main characters sets in motion events that effect the current state of  the world by threatening to unsettle the delicate mechanism that prevents  the superior werewolf race from annihilating their lesser co-inhabitants.  Boyd gives a masterful portrait of the werewolf: proud, arrogant and as  indulgent and intolerant to humans as humans are to wayward dogs or cats.  She describes their society in detail, describing their customs and  traditions which come together to form a hierarchy of utter simplicity and  ingenuity.  The reader relates to the werewolves' disdain of anything less  than themselves, even though this petulance is focused on none other than  human beings!  The plot interests as well as intrigues.  One wants to read  further being thoroughly engrossed by this story within a story.  At  times, Alexander's arrogance becomes annoying, while Tessa's willingness to  comply with any and all of Alexander's wishes makes her insipid.  However,  I believe these characteristics are vital to the plot and the denoument.  The portion of the story set in Alaska is done well.  Boyd's descriptive  ability enables one  to distinguish between each character even though at  times there is much form changing, fighting and travel over ice and snow.  I recommend Boyd's, &quot;The Promise&quot; also which further delves into  the Devoncroix history and allows a further peek at the forbidden and  exclusive Werewolf world.	2000-01-15

Unfortunately, this is another example of what readers in America crave: fast paced, poorly written trash that can easily be converted to a TV movie of the week.  It seems that even though  all the rules of literature are disregarded, books of this type float to  the surface of the mainstream, are touted by 'critics' and capture the  public's attention.  They are unavoidable, ubiquitously lining the best  shelf space in bookstores, drugstores and magazine stands with their  captivating jacket art, blatant reminders that publishers are out there to  sell books, not provide the populace with good reading.  The plot in this  gem is unbelievable:  the stereotypical FBI agent blunders into answers as  crudely as he blunders into women.  The reader may be careened down a bluff  edging the Pacific Ocean in Oregon and then kidnapped to the jungles of  Columbia, but somehow these spectacular locales fail to stimulate any of  the senses.  The supporting characters of the husband and wife FBI team,  while sterling examples of love and commitment,  lack real warmth, failing  to move the reader other than to bore him.  The author does her best to  make Mac a 'regular guy' who loves his beer and falls fast for the  hard-shooting gal DEA agent, but the reader gets the sense that Coulter is  trying too hard . . . or didn't bother enough and should enroll in a  remedial writing lab to relearn the basic literary elements despite the  stupendous amounts of money she must make with such offerings.  The mind  peaking concept of the sex drug, while having intriguing possibilities  flattens with its unfolding, coming off as contrived as a last minute twist  in a child's bedtime story.  I will say that the story does manage to  compel the reader to read on, at least during the first ten or fifteen  chapters.  Afterwards?  Mac and his DEA woman are transmuted into Rambo and  Brigette Nielsen; they manage to courageously blast their way out of a  jungle crawling with inept  mercenaries while under the mind-altering and  libido stimulating drug, all for the sake of millions of unsuspecting and  (one could conclude) worthless substance-seeking American adolescents.

Cheftu and Chloe are intersting characters, but  you would have thought that after their adventure in the first book of this  series that they had learned to trust one another.  Not so--through a  series of misunderstandings, the two characters continue to make faulty,  illogical moves that, I suppose, enable the author to write extra steamy  love scenes that detract rather than add to the plot.  Otherwise, the ideas  of connecting Atlantis with the Aztecs and Stoker's obscure Scholomance  reference in Dracula, while having  the pantheon of Greek gods and  goddesses rely on an immortality elixir invoked by the Mormon Urim and  Thummim are intriguing ones, but they are presented as almost asides, not  the mind-boggling conundrums they should represent. The author does not  flesh them out enough, but instead concentrates on exemplifying Chloe's  running and emergency skills and Cheftu's prowess in bed.  For me, the last  straw was expecting me to think it was cute that Chloe, great artist that  she is, was responsible for the famous boxer boy painting found by  Marinatos in the tepha covered ruins of Akrotiri on Santorini.

The intermingling of the historical setting (which was believable) with the growing attraction of the major characters (I pictured Nathaniel  as Daniel Day Lewis in breechcloats) helped to sustain this first  impression.  However as the book went on and adventure after adventure was  piled on at a most unbelievable rate, I found my attention and my credulity  flagging.  I felt that the author had written her story in pieces.  Each  adventure was like a small short story.  While this worked in the  beginning, it did not work in the end.  I have always thought that the  final pages of a novel should be a denouement where all the separate  threads of story are finally pieced together.  Not so in this book; instead  new characters are added and the story ends on a note of 'what-if' which I  assume will be the lead in to the sequel, but in no way makes the novel a  complete or satisfying work of literature. One further note of criticism:  I found the romance a bit cloying at times and with a man of Nathaniel's  obvious experience, more than a little far fetched.	1999-08-12

Club Dumas entertains with its sundry of interesting information about Alexander Dumas, his serials and the selective world of the rare book.  The occult undertones and puzzles added extra tantilization.  But other than that, the story of a jaded book detective, his penchant for a mystery Lolita and their involvement with a group of characters who have confused their identities to the point where they are acting out parts of Dumas' 3 Musketeers, was trite and like the outcome in  'The Flanders Panel' predictable.  Rebirth occurs in the onion layers of young flesh?  Come on-what were all the spectacular reviews about? Methinks most folk assume that when they read a novel with the scholarly undertones of Umberto Eco, automatically they have 'arrived' on that plane where those who prefer the commercially successful genre of Grisham et al can never reach.

I read the above review by thewest@earthnet and with his/her encouragement feel relieved to  review Katherine Neville's book 'The Magic Circle' despite the amazing blaze of feelings the read has conjured.  I admit  to having pretty much the same impression as 'thewest'.  I was stunned (at first) by the amount of information this author was pulling together from such varied sources.  As I neared page 500, I realized that no matter how complicated the intertwinings of the narrator's family relations (Ugh, in my opinion-was all that incest meant to be farcical?) were, the author was never, never, never going to pull the whole thing together in time to satisfy all the questions her 'sitings' had churned up.  I thought her ending where Sam and Ariel (two cousins-isn't that supposedly illegal?) discuss their revelations regarding the mysterious rune manuscripts was utter balderdash.  As a woman, I was disturbed and insulted that Neville thinks the secret to life's mysteries lies in a simple 'positioning'.  In 'Thenet's words, 'Give me a break!'  I just assumed Neville didn't really have an ending to the story or after 500 pages her editor told her to cut the chaff-the book really should have gone on for another 500 pages to fully satisfy the reader.  Are we to assume that Jesus and Miriam, his only true initiate, had assumed the proper positions and hence Miriam's mystical understanding?  The conclusion of the book is an example of Occam's razor in its worst application.  Trite BS. I am not a historian and I don't claim to know anything about what I read about in 'The Magic Circle'.  However, one good thing came from this read, I was very much taken with my own lack of knowledge regarding other cultures, but I am not sure that the things that interested me in the book are based on fact and that scares me.  People reading this book will automatically assume that what they read is some semblance of reality.  But which is true and which is fiction?  Neville should have at least had an afterward explaining where she got her valid material.  I suppose that since one did not exist, the entire book was based on fantasy and was an attempt to recaptivate her 'The Eight'audience. Can any historians tell me which parts of the story were based on fact? I've read Marion Zimmer Bradley's series on Avalon and Pauline Gedge's saga which touch on the same time period-the Roman annihilation of the druid's isle<br />of Mona.  I feel that it was handled in these books in a more factual way, but now, I am perplexed wondering what I should believe.  Yes, fiction is fiction, but even historians infer things by certain events.  Historical fiction always seemed to have tha ability to bring a dryer read to life.

US	53093124	R21IZ6UT6OVBMK	1877946885	820254032	Attic Light	Books	1	4	6	N	Y	Typical story of girl chases boy, gets zilch for efforts	I purchased &quot;Attic Light&quot; primarily to lavish in the descriptions of its setting, a lovely Greek Isle and a magical villa set in that pure, stark sunlight for which Greece is famous.  In this I was not disappointed.  The author successfully conveys the almost mesmerizing beauty of the islands.  However, the plot and its themes are all too familiar and unfortunately boring.  Kate, a travel writer, all too willingly falls for Nick, the godlike archaeologist.  Why?  He's the archetypical handsome selfish bore that most women are supposed to find irresistable.  So much for the intellectual advancement of women.  Henry, Kate's eventual husband, is the not-so-duped fool who hangs in suspended animation while Kate carries on her fascination with Nick behind his back.  So much for the moral advancement of woman.  The story outcome is obvious and not worth the pages it takes to read to arrive at that conclusion.  Even the prose style is cumbersome.  The sentences are run-on, meant to simulate the thought patterns of a confused woman, but succeed in only acting as a springboard for extraneous ideas and ponderings that make no real difference to the reader's overall enjoyment of the story.  Even the allusions to classical myth are cliche.  After reading the NYTimes review, I expected to encounter Odysseus and Agagmemnon on every other page.  They were sadly missed.	1998-01-23
