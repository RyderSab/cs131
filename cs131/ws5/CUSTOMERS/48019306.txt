Mostly it's a discussion of the author's transition from film to digital, and the benefits/differences of digital.  There isn't much actual information on Photoshop techniques and other means of producing digital B&W photos, and what there is is very basic and can be found in countless other books/magazine articles/web sites.  As well, the photos are not very inspiring, and certainly do not illustrate anything specific to digital photography.  A much better choice for an introduction to digital B&W photography is Barry Thornton's \\"Elements of Transition.\\"	2005-09-01

If you want to buy only one book, then Colour Confidence is a good choice.

Much of the information is of use to tourists, too - at least, tourists who want to do more than just see the top ten sights in Paris.  As one other reviewer noted, the book is written for an American audience, and consequently some of the discussion (such as the political and social differences between France and the U.S.) may not be entirely relevant to non-Americans.	2004-09-18

I picked up a copy from the library, and will likely buy a copy to re-read for inspiration and insight.  The book presents photos from 38 of the world's top landscape photographers -- big names like Joe Cornish, Galen Rowell, Art Wolfe, Charlie Waite.  For each photographer there is a brief bio, followed by several photos (typically some of their best).  Each photo is accompanied by a discussion of how the photo came to be made, including thoughts on the creative process and technique.  Technical info (camera, film, exposure) is provided for those who like to know that stuff.	2004-06-13

This is a great book -- lots of Cartier-Bresson's photos (all my favourites, and there are many), well-printed, with just enough text to add some substance to the book without overwhelming the images.  There are even a bunch of photos of Cartier-Bresson at the end for those who are curious what he looks like.  A few of his sketches/paintings and some information on his films are also included, which may interest some.  The only downside is the book weighs a ton, and is an awkward size that doesn't fit in my bookcase.  ;-)  Highly recommended.	2004-06-13

Too much space is given up to text, and there aren't enough images to satisfy.<br />Nevertheless, the book is an interesting read, or should I say an interesting skim.  I skimmed through the text, stopping to read interesting bits here and there.  Had those interesting bits been retained, much of the rest of the text eliminated and more images included, it would be a 5-star book.<br />One other comment is that the emphasis is on American street photography, to the point that some notable non-American street photographers are excluded completely.	2004-06-13

I found the historical aspects of the story the most interesting, as Caleb Carr's detailed descriptions bring to life the city, people's attitudes and other aspects of life 100 years ago.  No surprise, as the liner notes state that he was educated as a historian, and is a native New Yorker.<br />As for the murder investigation, although it's interesting, it's not a &quot;page turner&quot; story.  It is a very intellectual story with bits and pieces of action.  Caleb Carr doesn't manage to convey the drama of the action quite as well as he conveys the historical aspects of the story.  And I found the conclusion of the story unsatisfying.<br />I agree entirely with the 4/5 rating this book gets (to date) -- 5 for the historical part of the story, 3 for the murder investigation.	2000-12-26

Nothing compares to what the author of The Long Walk and his companions went through in 1941.

My biggest complaint is that  the instructions tell you to click this or press that key, but no  explanation is provided as to why.  I have to make extensive use of the  on-line Help and frequently refer to other Photoshop books to understand  key concepts.<br />I also find the organization of the book a bit haphazard.   Lessons present concepts in a disorganized fashion -- for example, some  info on a specific selection tool, some more info on layers, and one or two  &quot;advanced&quot; concepts (not properly explained, either) thrown in  just to keep things confusing.<br />Finally, compared with most Photoshop  books, this book is quite unattractive.  There is almost no colour in the  book, and what there is is pretty plain.  I enjoy Photoshop books with  photos that inspire me -- this one certainly doesn't.<br />There are some good  lessons in the book, and overall there is a good amount of information, but  if I were learning Photoshop from scratch again, I'd pick another book to  start with.	2000-09-19

The information in this book has shown me how to quickly  and effectively adjust colours in a digital photograph to optimize its  appearance, and then how to selectively enhance the photograph even  further.<br />The author works in the pre-press industry, so he prefers to  work in a CMYK colourspace, and all the instructions in the book are for  CMYK as a result.  I work in a RGB colourspace, but it is relatively  straightforward for me to convert the techniques given for CMYK to RGB.   The only difference is that RGB doesn't have a black colour channel, so the  one chapter that focusses on black is not as useful to me (converting to  LAB colour does produce a black channel, however, so the advice given for  the black channel in CMYK colour aren't confined exclusively to the CMYK  colourspace).<br />If you want to gain an understanding of colour and means of  using Photoshop to enhance and optimize the colour of photographs , then  this book is a must-have.	2000-09-19
