US	52480873	R2R2NV1VTOTUD7	0679777547	582743995	The Club Dumas	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great fun	This is my second Perez-Reverte novel, and I enjoyed it equally as well as my first (which was *The Seville Communion*.)  It would seem, from my Perez-Reverte experience to date, that he has a gift for immersing memorable, well-rounded characters in an absorbing, unusual mystery.<br />The mystery of *The Club Dumas* surrounds a rare book--well, actually, three slightly different copies of the same book-which, when used together, are reputed to enable one to summon Satan.  Lucas Corso, a rare book \\"detective\\", is hired by the owner of one of the books to authenticate his copy and to track down the other two.  As he travels throughout Europe on the case, he's hunted by a mysterious stranger with a scar on his face, and he keeps running into a mysterious (and, of course, beautiful) young student who \\"coincidentally\\" turns up in many of the places Corso does.<br />Throughout it all, Perez-Reverte weaves in multiple literary references to Sherlock Holmes and The Three Musketeers and keeps the reader wondering just how all of the plot strands can possibly tie together.  Well, they do, quite brilliantly.  There is definitely more Perez-Reverte in my future.<br />(A side note: As has been mentioned, the Polanski film, *The Ninth Gate*, was based on this book.  I thought the film did a terrific job of bringing the book's thrilling atmosphere to life, with hints of evil throughout and Johnny Depp made a fine Corso--until the absolutely preposterous and greatly changed ending.  A great film, until its last twenty minutes or so.)	2004-06-18

Barnaby's in his early thirties, and is not particularly pleased his life.  He's got a demanding ex-wife, a pre-teen daughter he can't connect with, a nowhere job and wealthy parents that don't understand him.  He's in a rut, and he doesn't know how he got there or how to get out of it.  Really, it isn't so much that he made poor choices, as that he never really made *any* choices--he just sort of lets things happen to him.  I think that's why I didn't like him as a character, and couldn't get terribly interested in what happened to him next.<br />Barnaby believes that his life will improve once he finds his &quot;angel&quot;.   (His family fortune came about as a result of several family members finding their angel--kind of like a muse, I guess.)  Early on in the book, Barnaby believes his found his angel in Sophia, a woman whom he overheard in conversation in a train station.  Against his character, he decides to pursue her.  Once they become involved he proceeds, for essentially the rest of the book, to wait for the &quot;angel&quot; to bring about his reversal of fortune.  What passive, frustrating character!  He doesn't grow or improve.  Things do somewhat improve for him by the book's end, but more by chance than by his actions.<br />Tyler's writing is good, but perhaps I've missed her point. I can't recommend this book.	2003-09-15

It's a beautifully written book, though Karr's youth is not necessarily idyllic.  <br />Mary is a feisty little scrapper of a girl.  She's got a sassy mouth and a huge store of love for her daddy.  Karr's writing is both poetic and vivid.  The often unpleasant events of her childhood are full of imagery and feeling-the people and places of her youth become real to the reader, and young Mary's resilience is admirable.  I'm looking forward to reading her next book, *Cherry* to see how Karr's teenage years unfold.	2003-09-09

It's a book beloved by so many people (my husband among them), yet it's reviled by probably equally as many.  I had a very hard time determining which side I was on.  I think I may be one of the very few sitting on the fence.<br />Toole's characterization of Ignatius is indeed a brilliant portrayal of a self-centered, lazy, cynical and repulsive man, but I had a hard time finding his exploits funny.  I've met people like Ignatius, and quite frankly, I want to get away from them, not indulge them as they attempt to skew the rest of the world their way.  I truly despised Ignatius, and couldn't wait to finish the book to be rid of him.<br />But, how can I fault an author who managed to evoke such a strong feeling of disgust from me?  That's obviously the result of some darn fine writing.  The story flows smoothly, combining Ignatius' misadventures with those of the other characters in a climactic conclusion that brought them all together an effectively amusing little tangle.  So here I sit on the fence - I don't want to meet Ignatius again any time soon, but I don't regret having spent a little time with him.	2003-06-25

The townsfolk shun Finch, but she finds acceptance and solace with the souls who inhabit the cemetery-she is able to see and speak with the dead.<br />Finch has rich friendships with the lost souls; and, with their encouragement, she learns to reach out to those they left behind.  She helps the living loved ones learn the truth about those they lost, so that both they and their dead can move on.  In so doing, Finch begins to inch back toward the social world of the living herself.<br />The lessons Reynolds incorporates into her tale may be a bit obvious (be decent to all people, don't be judgmental), but her style is so gently winning that any syrupiness is overcome.	2003-05-08

It is the timeworn tale of the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who wins the love of the wealthy boy.  But it doesn't necessarily end happily ever after, and for that it's a step above your run-of-the-mill romance novel.<br />Binchy's enchanting depiction of Ireland in the `50s and `60s and her loving characterizations warmly send the reader into that time and place.  It was a treat for me every evening to come home from working in the corporate frenzy of the new millennium to return to that simpler time.  Nothing too terribly shocking or powerful, not a whole lot to contemplate when you reach the end, just a welcome respite for a few hundred pages.<br />If, as many reviewers here have suggested, ECHOES is not Maeve Binchy's best work, then I find myself very fortunate to be able to work my way through her catalog.	2003-05-08

Then I heard the series being likened to Roald Dahl's books, and, having worn my childhood copy of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* to bits, I had to check them out.  Mr. Snicket is no Roald Dahl.  Sure, both writers understand that a lot of kids like to read about pretty gruesome stuff.  But, where Dahl's stories are inventive and charming, *The Bad Beginning* is pretty simplistic and derivative.  Things seemed to resolve themselves a bit too quickly.  It's not a bad book, just not worthy of its hype.  If I happened to find the next book in the series lying in the street, I'd probably read it, but otherwise, probably not.	2003-03-21

Sounds a bit like a heavy-handed lesson, doesn't it?  It could have been were it not for Rose Tremain's tremendous development of the character of Robert Merivel.  <br />Sure, he starts out as someone we should hate-forsaking a noble career in medicine to hang with King Charles II, and wallow in gluttonous luxury.  Instead, though, he's so darn funny and charming, you can't help but be caught up in his silly exploits, from his garishly decorated country manor to his persistently studying painting, despite showing no aptitude for it whatsoever.<br />Then, when a foolish mistake casts him out of the king's favour, he's forced to find his own place in the world.  Here, Tremain could have turned Merivel's maturation into a ... sermon, but instead, she lets him find his way, believably, back to humanity.  He stumbles a few times along the way, but eventually he grows into a rather wise and compassionate man, while still retaining a bit of the twinkle of his wild youth.<br />In the end, he is justly rewarded for his \\"restoration\\", and so too is the reader.	2003-03-21

If those words truly describe Bergman's style, then we can safely say that his daughter successfully captured on page what her parents captured before her on film.<br />Our narrator, Karin, tells her family's story in a bluntly honest way.  Hardships are neither embellished nor glossed over; they are what they are.  Ullman's prose is spare and almost harsh, like the landscape of her heritage.  You don't feel as though you're entering her world as you read, it's more as though it's being shown to you from a distance.  This makes for a very absorbing read, though not necessarily an enjoyable one.  The story told in BEFORE YOU SLEEP story is not happy, nor terribly plot driven, but if you're looking more for atmosphere than story, you won't go wrong reading it.	2003-01-26

I've had it on my to-be-read shelf (actually, it's more like an entire bookcase--I can't stop buying) literally for years.  There just always seemed to be something that I wanted to read more.  I even broke my cardinal rule, and saw the movie first.  So, when I finally pulled it off the shelf to read on an eight-hour flight to Italy, I was expecting a light, easy, funny read.  <br />And that's just what I got.  Nothing earth-shattering, nothing terribly deep, just a funny, funny story about a slightly goofy girl's search for love.

Samad (or Sam, as Archie calls him) is a Bangladeshi immigrant trying to make a good (and properly Muslim) life for his wife and twin sons in England.  The story winds its way through their friendship from its odd beginning during the war, through the complicated events that befall their children and finishes with a bang-up ending that ties all loose ends neatly together, in the manner of Tom Wolfe.<br />Smith succeeds in breathing life into all of her extremely disparate characters, and manages to write convincingly about WWII, genetics and the beliefs of Jehovah's witnesses, among many other wide-ranging subjects.  All this in a first novel, written in her early twenties!	2003-01-08

I have very vivid memories of staring, intrigued, at the photo of Chang and Eng Bunker, the \\"first\\" Siamese twins.  That very same photo now sits on the cover of Darin Strauss' elegantly written novel, *Chang and Eng*.  I suppose that fascination is what drew me to read the book, and Strauss does not disappoint.<br />The story really belongs to Eng, the more serious (and less prone to drink), brother.  He struggles throughout with conflicting feelings of love for his brother and his passionate desire to be free of him.  (If you've read *I Know This Much To Be True* by Wally Lamb, this is reminiscent of the lead character's conflicted relationship with his schizophrenic twin, though Eng's struggle is further complicated by the simple fact that he physically *cannot* leave his brother.)  Eng also struggles with his feelings of desire for his brother's wife, and with his need to be respected as an intelligent man, not a spectacle.<br />While I cannot say how much more I truly know about the Bunkers given that this is not a biography but a novel, I was intrigued and entertained by both the story and Strauss' graceful language.	2002-12-05

Father Lorenzo Quart is sent by the Vatican to Seville to uncover just who this hacker, who goes by the code name Vespers, really is.<br />But really, the mystery is incidental.  For me, the book's raison d'etre wasn't really to discover who Vespers was, but to present the reader with vividly drawn characters and situations.  The scenes that portrayed the slowly unfolding relationship between Quart and Maccarena, or the funny-sad trio of would-be criminals, or Don Priamo, the aged priest who would sacrifice all for his simple faith were what kept me reading.<br />I will definitely read more by Perez-Reverte.	2002-10-22

The story starts out deliciously campy-in pre-WWII Germany, Karl's adopted Jewish brother, Eric, is killed escaping from the Nazis that Karl's jealous twin, Kurt, sent after him.  Eric leaves behind a number of African artifacts brought back from a recent trip-including a shrunken head, and what just might be...a voodoo doll.  Karl, wishing to avenge Eric's death, takes up these artifacts to use them against Kurt.<br />I have to admit that after such a truly bizarre beginning, I thought the book might turn out to be a guilty pleasure.  But, no such luck.  After the over-the-top melodrama at the beginning of the book, the story immediately drops away, and Caldwell launches into a dull, dull diatribe on the loss of innocence or something.  Painfully difficult to finish.	2002-07-18

At times, Kingsolver's ecological preaching was over-powering and took the place of real plot or character development.  But then, I'd read a magnificent passage that would take my breath away.  She really is a phenomenal writer-elegant, yet approachable.<br />Of the three slightly entwined stories, I, like many reviewers, preferred &quot;Moth Love&quot;.  Lusa's tale  was the most emotionally interesting, and there was evident character growth.  The &quot;Old Chestnuts&quot; were cute-ish, but a bit cliched.  &quot;Predators&quot; was my least favorite.  Deanna was over-bearing and her continual cycling between lust and guilt grew tiresome.<br />THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is one of my favourite books.  I think Kingsolver's a bit off the mark with PRODIGAL SUMMER, though she can still occasionally stun the reader with brilliance.	2002-06-14

Sir Owen asks Weaver to retrieve some personal papers of a rather delicate nature from the prostitute he mistakenly left them with.  From there the story jumps off in multiple directions-into the dirty dealings of stock jobbers, into the hardship of Jewish life in British society, into a possible connection to his own father's murder a short time earlier, into Weaver's encounters with the biggest thug of them all, Jonathan Wilde.<br />Weaver is a likable character and his friendship with Elias, the playwright/surgeon is charming.  The portrait of 18th c. London is vivid-you can sense the dampness and smell the must.  I've read that there are plans to film this book-it would make a fabulous movie.

I'd heard so many great things about her writing, and the premises of her novels sound like my cup of tea.  I don't think I made the right choice to sample her work with LOCAL GIRLS.  Had I known this was really a book of short stories, I definitely would have passed it by.  I'm not a fan of the short story format.  I missed the flow of a novel and the richness of detail that is just not there in a short story.  It was obvious that these stories were meant to stand on their own.  Each new &quot;chapter&quot; re-explained details of earlier chapters as though I hadn't just read them.  I found this quite annoying.<br />My poor choice, however, has not dissuaded me from trying another of Hoffman's works.  All that I had heard about her writing is true.  Her style is warm and her characterization gorgeous.  Even though these were short stories, I could still empathize with Gretel and her family.

What's interesting about him, is that although he is really outside of the events taking place in the story, his character is fully developed.  Everything he tells us is unmistakably colored by what we learn about his personality; he is an observer, though not an impartial one.  I can't recall ever reading another first-person narrated book where the narrator is not a central character, and yet is a complex and interesting person in his own right.<br />That said, the story itself is well-written and engaging enough-as others have said it is the town's reaction to the girls' disappearances rather than the mystery itself that is most absorbing.  It isn't the spine-tingler you might expect, though it has its moments, and the finale is pretty darn exciting.  All in all a good read.	2002-01-24

The first story is that of Annalukshmi-a young teacher who simply wants to forge her own way through life, without being bound by societal conventions.   She is a teacher, who dreams of being a headmistress, until she learns that because she is not English it can never happen.  She hopes to find a loving relationship, but instead must struggle with the necessity of arranged marriages.  Selvadurai beautifully portrays her inner conflict and frustration with the limitations imposed upon her, and the open-ended resolution of her story is so completely in tune with her character.<br />The second story is that of Balendran, the beloved younger son of a wealthy businessman.  When the man with whom he had an affair during college in England comes to Ceylon, Balendran gets a glimpse of how differently his life could have turned out had his father not abruptly ended the affair.  He is forced to look at where he is and where he could have been, and to decide where he wants to be in the future.  Several other events force Balendran to take control at last of his life, instead of letting others control it for him. <br />Selvadurai allows the stories to quietly be told.  CINNAMON GARDENS is not a page-turner in the usual sense of the word, but I guarantee if you read it you'll want to stick with it to see where Balendran and Annalukshmi end up.	2002-01-24

It's not a linear autobiography--it skips about from her childhood to early adulthood willy-nilly, and doesn't strictly stick to reporting things that happened in her life.  She gives a lot of insight into her own personal philosophy that somehow gives the book a much more friendly, conversational tone than the typical memoir.  If I had to have a complaint, I'd wish that she were a little more gossipy about her famous husbands/boyfriends, but that's just not her style.	2001-11-28

A lot of unusual and upsetting things happen, until eventually, Estee finds herself pregnant by the would-be real estate mogul her father has determined she should marry.  The baby is born a cannibal, who eats every living thing in his sight line.  Bizarre enough for you?<br />I read this entire book (thankfully, it's quite short) with a feeling of revulsion, though I can't quite pinpoint why.  It was somehow just very unpleasant.  I will admit to having some level of curiosity to see how the whole debacle would end.  (Predictably weird.)  There are hints throughout that Estee may be delusional herself, and there are lots of ties to the whole \\"eating everything\\" theme (see the book's title), but I really didn't care a lick.  Not recommended at all.	2001-10-29

He is obviously quite brilliant, having learned to speak (rather eloquently, I might add), and to read simply by secretly watching others.  He's sensitive, kind, and appreciative of nature's beauty-all of the most admirable characteristics of a wonderful soul.  And yet, he is vilified by all who come in contact with him because of his physical repulsiveness.<br />His longing for love, especially from Victor, was so painful that it became difficult for me to read.  I kept hoping he'd find someone to show him the littlest bit of kindness.  His turn to violence is entirely understandable, and Victor's irresponsibility toward his creation is despicable.  Victor, who is outwardly handsome but cowardly and cruel, is the story's true monster.<br />In addition to writing a captivating story, Shelley raises many social issues that are still relevant today, nearly 200 years later, and the book provides a superb argument against *ever* cloning a human being.<br />(Note: I have the edition with the marvelous woodcut illustrations by Barry Moser and the Joyce Carol Oates afterword - superb!)	2001-10-23

But that never quite happens.  The first 150 pages or so are extremely tough going, with dry accounts of Barr's successes and failures as he slowly establishes himself in this untamed world.  Then, he sends for his young cousin, Amelia, or Melie, to become his bride.  At this point, the story seemed to open up a bit, and I began to feel involved.  But never completely.  <br />There were many horribly sad circumstances, that didn't have the emotional impact on me they could have, if the author didn't keep me so distanced from them.  There are interesting secondary characters, like Maureen Dolan, and Hogg, but they aren't well developed.  I'm giving it three stars, because the bones are there for a really great story; I just wish there was a bit more meat on them.	2001-10-15

I'd been meaning to read it for years, and when I finally did, I was not disappointed.  Golden has created a world that so few of us know anything about.  I certainly cannot speak to the accuracy of his depiction of the life of a pre-WWII Geisha, but was captivated none-the-less.<br />His portrayal of the character of Sayuri is not fairy-tale perfect as so many have implied.  I found the character believably flawed-particularly in her treatment of Nobu, the gruff-but-kind, disfigured businessman who chooses her to be his mistress.  And, even in her later days in New York, she still seemed to maintain an aura of artificiality, as though the role of the Geisha could not be shed.<br />I couldn't help but be swept up in the world Golden has created.  The story is well-worth the hype it has generated.	2001-09-14

Both stories are engaging, and in the end, they are bound together tightly.<br />Olivia is thoroughly American in her beliefs and lifestyle.  As such, she is embarrassed and annoyed by Kwan's refusal to be assimilated by American culture-in particular, Olivia is bothered by Kwan's insistence that she sees and speaks to ghosts, or \\"yin\\" people.  Kwan also pesters Olivia to reunite with her estranged husband, Simon.  Interspersed throughout the present day story are pieces of the story of Kwan's prior life as Nunumu, a one-eyed servant to a group of American missionaries.  <br />Olivia, Simon and Kwan travel to Kwan's village in China (also the village of Olivia's father).  It is there that the two stories converge in a jumble of ghosts, reincarnation, and unconditional love.  There is a touch of hokiness to it all, but it is still an enjoyable tale.	2001-09-14

If we are to believe Henry, he was just out of the frame of a famous picture of early IRA members, the uncredited author of a famous poem, the most handsome man in Ireland, the best \\"ride\\" in town...the list of Henry's \\"accomplishments\\" is nearly endless.<br />Henry's recounting of his adventures during the early days of the IRA is entrancing-the events themselves are full of large-scale drama, tragedy and courage, while the way in which these tales are told is full of braggadocio and humor.  I look forward to Henry's next escapades in this planned trilogy.	2001-09-14

As the story of Victor and Rita unfolds, the deep melancholy grows.<br />Victor and Rita are half-siblings; Rita the product of their mother's affair in her small Italian town while her husband (Victor's father) was in Canada setting the foundation for a new life for his family  Over the course of the  first two books in the trilogy, their mother dies after giving birth to Rita on the ocean liner bringing them to Canada, and Victor and Rita are raised together for a few years on his father's farm, until Rita is adopted by a nearby couple.<br />The siblings grow up and grow apart, until the opening of WHERE SHE HAS GONE,  where they meet again in Toronto-Victor as a grad student/writer and Rita just starting university.   The relationship they develop as adults is complicated and sad, but compelling.  Ricci's language is distilled to a very simple, effective style, that suits the mood he creates beautifully.<br />All three books in the trilogy are highly recommended, but it's not necessary to have read the first two to be moved by the last (though I'm sure after reading WHERE SHE HAS GONE you'll want to).	2001-08-10

I marvel his vivid pictures of the people who populate his books-the redneck captain of industry, Charlie Croker; the uptight, black lawyer, Roger \\"Too\\" White and his hunger for respect; Conrad Hensley, a warehouse grunt who merely wants more for his young family.  Even the minor characters are fully fleshed, like Charlie's daughter's nanny who is almost entirely proper, except for her aversion to shoes.<br />Wolfe likes to throw these believable characters into wildly overblown and implausible situations, and in BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, he was successful in making it work.  He was successful, too, in A MAN IN FULL, until he tried to tie together the stories of all the main characters into an ending taken a few steps too far.  I agree with other reviewers who found the ending to be \\"tacked on\\", and silly, marring an otherwise excellent read.<br />In all, I'd recommend A MAN IN FULL, but only if you're  prepared for a rather unsatisfying ending.	2001-07-14

I was pleasantly surprised.  <br />The story follows Josie Trask, wife of Peter, mother of 3-year-old Henry, American Lit grad student having trouble getting her thesis finished, spending the summer living with her mother, apart from her husband, doing research for a schlocky bio on Jackie O.  Josie is a fair bit more intellectual than most 30-or-so female central characters have been lately.  She goes through a bit of a crisis in her marriage and winds up with a better understanding of herself, her mother and her relationship with her husband.  As the story unfolds, we are treated to tidbits from Josie's Jackie research, that are both interesting on their own, and in the way they relate to what Josie's going through.<br />Preston's writing is strong, the characters are authentic and the story is a pleasure all the way through.  It's also peaked my interest in reading more about Jackie and the Kennedys.	2001-07-14

I was looking forward to an informative historical novel about a truly terrifying woman.  Instead what I got was a cold, dull, mildly pornographic tale.<br />Don't get me wrong, I expected some pretty graphic stuff given the subject matter, but there were a few too many completely gratuitous sex scenes seemingly randomly thrown in.  Even secondary and tertiary characters were given perverse romps in the hay.  I know Codrescu is an intelligent man--you can't be an NPR commentator and be a dummy--but I can't help picturing him rubbing his hands and grinning lasciviously as he wrote this stuff.<br />This is not the scholarly work you might expect--consider yourself warned.	2001-05-28

I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then.  It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.<br />The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable.  Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings.  And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.<br />Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice.  After completing Emma for the second time, I'm eager to pick up her other books and lose myself in her enchanting narrative.	2001-05-13

Both stories end unhappily, and the fate of the Englishman's boy is at the heart of each.<br />I think what I appreciated most about this book was the soft, subdued way in which the stories unfolded.  The writing was clean and unaffected, and Vanderhaeghe let the weight of his stories speak for themselves, rather than gum them up with flashy language.  Though the two stories were set about forty years apart, the similarities between the cutthroat nature of Hollywood and the old west are apparent.  The Englishman's boy serves in both stories as their spiritual center--true goodness, surrounded by flawed, selfish individuals.	2001-04-16

The plot, centered around a number of biker gang-related deaths, is serviceable, but I never found myself engrossed in it.  I just wasn't that interested in who-done-it.  I kept plodding through hoping to get hooked somewhere along the way, but closed the book after the last page thinking &quot;so what&quot;.<br />Reichs is a decent writer and her descriptions of the types of icky things a forensic pathologist does were interesting enough, I suppose.  I won't say I'd never read another of her books, but I surely won't be rushing out to buy a first edition.	2001-03-21

It's the story of the battle of wills between two parties, Mr. Behrani, and Kathy Niccolo, over a little bungalow just off the shore in northern California.  When a third party, Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon, steps in to help Kathy, the battle gets intensely out of hand, and everything snowballs uncontrollably until the disastrous finale.<br />While it was beautifully crafted, and I marvel at how Dubus was able to wring out so much depth from such a simple plot line, the tensions are piled so thickly I couldn't appreciate the story--I was too stressed out!  I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone, unless they felt they needed a little extra anxiety in their life.	2001-02-16

Although I haven't yet read Mary Shelley's classic, (it's in my huge \\"to read\\" pile at home), I am familiar enough with the story to have been intrigued by the premise of hearing it from Elizabeth's point of view.  Unfortunately, THE MEMOIRS OF ELIZABETH FRANKENSTEIN ultimately falls far short of my high hopes.<br />I enjoyed Elizabeth's early years, and her last few, leading up to her discovery of what her lover, Victor was really up to at school, and her eventual ill-fated encounter with \\"Adam\\".  It was the stuff in between that disappointed me most.   Elizabeth's adoptive mother initiates her into a bizarre secret society of women, who participate in a number of odd lesbian rituals and secret midnight meetings in the woods, where women are celebrated and men are reviled.  These scenes weren't offensive or enlightening, just silly.<br />I'm not sure what Roszak was trying to accomplish here.  Elizabeth's voice did not come across as a strong, female one; but rather a confused, manipulated girl, severely influenced by her delusional mother.<br />The writing is decent enough, and parts of the story are commendable, but overall, this book misses the mark.	2001-02-05

Guterson spares no effort in bringing the West Coast to his reader.  He also spins a pretty good courtroom yarn, although to me, the plot was almost secondary.<br />Ishmael Chambers, the town newspaper reporter/publisher, is covering the trial of Kabuo Miyamoto.  Miyamoto is on trial for the murder of Carl Heine, once his high school chum, over a piece of ill-gotten land.  The novel follows two story lines: the present-day investigation into the real story of how Carl was killed, and the doomed, teenage love affair between Ishmael and Hatsue, now Kabuo's wife.<br />The stories are both compelling and Guterson convincingly depicts the shameful treatment the U.S. gave its Japanese American citizens during WWII.  If I have one complaint, it's that as I got deeper into the mystery, and closer to its resolution, I kept wishing Guterson would cut the descriptiveness and just resolve things!

Grace and Beatrice so obviously did.  This book is a brilliant illustration of how the system fails us.  (Although, I must admit, I'm not 100% convinced that Schlictmann wasn't at least partly to blame.  I think the big payoff was his ultimate motivation-and his greed was, finally, his downfall.)<br />I also felt amazed at how Harr was able to create such excitement around every motion filed, deposition taken and objection sustained or overruled.  It was as compelling as any thriller I've ever read.  I'm no legal expert, but I can see how this book would be extremely useful to any first-year law student.  Harr's research is impeccable; he really brought the most minute legal and technical details to light in a straightforward and reasonably objective manner.<br />In closing, while W.R. Grace and Beatrice sleazed their way through this debacle without having to admit guilt, the Woburn families affected by this tragedy can feel somewhat vindicated in that anyone who reads A CIVIL ACTION will surely be convinced that Grace and Beatrice are truly at fault.	2001-01-03

I could sense its conflicting nature - lush, bountiful magnificence coexisting with harsh, strangling decay.<br />But The Poisonwood Bible is by no means merely a travelogue.  It is so much more than just the journey of the Price family (Nathan, Orleanna, and daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May) to the Congo.  It follows the family's journey into disintegration, and the paths each member chose individually to take from that point forward.<br />Ms. Kingsolver's prose is graceful and ripe with imagery and symbolism. Every sentence is a joy to read, with not one unnecessarily chosen word and she brilliantly creates a unique voice for each narrator.  There are scenes that stay with the reader long after they've been read.  A couple of times, I actually had to put the book aside for a few days, somewhat overcome by my feelings, until I felt ready to come back to it.  I disagree with reviewers who felt that the book carried on too long after the Price family's departure from Kilanga.  I found it fascinating to learn what each woman took with her from the Congo, and how the experience shaped their entire lives.<br />This is a glorious piece of work.  Do not miss it.	2000-11-13

But overall, the book gets bogged down by the snotty, I'm-smarter-and-more-hip-than-you'll-ever-be tone of its author.  Brinkley intersperses snippets of regional history with reminiscences about the adventures he and his students had while touring through those regions. I bought this book fully expecting to prefer the personal pieces to the history, but found the opposite to be true. Being a Canadian with little more than a very basic level of exposure to U.S. history, I can honestly say I learned a good deal from this book. <br />But in between those chunks of history, one has to bear Brinkley's endless name dropping (he knows Ken Kesey and knew William S. Burroughs, to name but two) and his oh-so-appropriately chosen tapes to play while rolling through each stop on the tour. (Elvis in Memphis, LL Cool J in LA.)<br />Brinkley should stick to writing pure history and leave the personal stuff out.	2000-10-14

Several readers have objected to  her descriptions of the many sumptuous banquets and elegant articles of  clothing, but that's what makes the foreign become so tangible.  But, while  I whole-heartedly loved Mary, Queen of Scots and The Autobiography of Henry  VIII, I don't feel I can recommend Cleo quite so highly.<br />While George  successfully creates the sensual and exotic feel of Ancient Egypt, I didn't  find the story truly compelling until about 50 pages from the end.  (And I  had to wade through 900 pages of less-than-compelling story to get there!)

Their  passionate and romantic deaths were beautifully rendered, and made the  previous 900 pages somewhat worthwhile. <br />I look forward to reading  George's future books (and I'm very curious to see who she tackles next),  but wouldn't recommend this one unless you've a lot of time to kill.	2000-09-07

The characters were just a bit too  quirky-quaint-homespun for my taste.  The notion that their very quirkiness  was meant to teach us all a \\"meaningful lesson about ourselves\\", was  transparent from the start.<br />But, as the story progressed, I found myself  really beginning to like Novalee, much as I tried not to.  She  grew to be  such an interesting and accomplished young woman, that I found myself  feeling that she'd definitely be someone I could be friends with.  (The  other characters, sad to say, continued to annoy me throughout the entire  novel.  Very one-dimensional with obvious lessons to teach:  Sister  Husband-true goodness; Lexie-mixed-up, insecure &amp; desperately wanting  to be loved; Moses &amp; Certain-the difficulties in getting over the loss  of a child, and so on...)  <br />I also had a little difficulty wrapping my  head around Novalee's developing relationship with Forney, since he seemed  like a hopelessly certifiable nut-job at the beginning of the story, but I  guess he was able to turn himself around by letting such a self-possessed,  stable woman like Novalee into his life.<br />So I guess my advice would be,  if you're like me, and get turned off by hackneyed, eccentric characters,  don't give up on Novalee.  Her story alone is worth your while.	2000-09-07

This would be the perfect  book for a long plane ride-as long as your seatmate doesn't mind your  occasional outbursts!  <br />I look forward to catching up with the rest of  this series.	2000-08-31

Lamb's language is clean and simple, and completely natural.  His characterizations are authentic and believable.  Each character felt \\"knowable\\", and yet fascinating.  The plot is entirely  original and compelling from page one.<br />Lamb was able to convincingly  portray Dominick's difficulty in resolving his feelings of love and  responsibility for his schizophrenic twin brother, Thomas , with his desire  to be free of the burden his brother's illness has become. This love/burden  impacts the other relationships in Dominick's life in so many ways, and  many of the intricately developed supporting characters have their own  highly believable hardships.  In fact, some characters; for example, Lisa,  the social worker, Dessa, Dominick's ex-wife, and even Ray, his stepfather,  are so engaging that they are deserving of their own novels.<br />Others have  written that they felt the ending was too happy or too completely resolved.   I argue that after having spent 987 pages with Dominick Birdsey, reading  about his seemingly endless streak of rotten luck, I was thrilled that  things ended so well for him-he deserved it!  I felt as though I could let  him go without having to worry or wonder what catastrophic event he might  be hit with next.	2000-07-05

This book earns it's star solely based on the effort Ms. Wood obviously put into researching Islamic culture and society.  That being said, the story and writing never rise above the level of a basic romance  novel-complete with contrived coincidences and forbidden love.  If that's  your cup of tea (and it's not mine-this was a book club selection so I had  to read it), then you'll probably love this book.  If you're looking for  something with a little more substance, keep looking.	2000-05-24

I got wrapped up in the twisty romance, and found the tulip market side plot intriguing, but instantly forgettable.  Don't get me wrong, it's a  really enjoyable read  (hence my strong rating), but there's not much to think about when it's  done.  I chose this book for my book club based on its great reviews, and  now I'm wondering what we'll have to say about it.	2000-03-30
