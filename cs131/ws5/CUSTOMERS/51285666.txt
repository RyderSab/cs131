They have to be something special to keep me up past my bedtime.  And this novel succeeded in tantalizing me past the witching hour.  <br />At first, I thought it was a series of short stories or vignettes.  At first, I hated the characters.  But somehow, they drew me.  Maybe it is Schickler's interesting way of grabbing on to a detail that others might deem insignificant; maybe it is the Friends on Acid feel of the book, or maybe it just is a modern fairytale with some amazing twists.  Whatever it was, it worked for me.  <br />This is not a book for everyone.  Women might get annoyed at the portrayal of female characters who seem to want to be controlled by the men.  Some might find the sex acts to be offputting and bizarre.  But the book, on the whole, reminded me of how magical writing can be.	2002-11-28

The  ideas of survival and loss are at their most fundamental in such a story and can make for a riveting read.  In this case, I must say, I felt very much as if I was reading a skeleton version of the book.  It was a cool, years-skipping, look at Lucy Gault's life after a childish mistake turns into years of tragedy.  I would love to give this a better review, but I am afraid that the tale left me feeling a bit chill.  I never developed affection for any of the charcters and though I sympathized with the situation, it was the writing style that cooled my empathy.  There are so many other wonderful books out there, I must say that I wish I hadn't spent my time on this one.	2002-10-07

I picked up this book for several reasons:  its length, the fame of its author, the blurb on the back.  And it is the feeling that I am missing something that is compelling me onwards.  But I find the stacato sound of his writing to be very offputting.  If I were to write the review as he write his novel, it would be thus:<br />Porter didn't think the book was good.  Porter regretted picking it up.  Porter won't finish.  Life is too short, Porter thought.<br />So, if you like the spray of bullets that are his words, then go for it.

Honestly, I think they will all be fascinated by the account of a boy, a castaway from a devestating shipwreck, surviving 227 days on a small life boat with a tiger.  Told as if it is a biography, Life of Pi is both gripping and powerful with profound philosophical implications.  Yet, it is not written as an allegory.  As a reader, you easily accept the premise that this boy, Pi, has only a tiger as a companion and so must balance his life on the reft between surviving the elements and surviving the tiger.<br />This book has been nominated here in the UK for the Booker Prize (the biggest prize for fiction in the UK) and deserves every accolade.  The philosophy and biology is so beautifully well done that you don't even realize you have been instructed.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-03

Usually, I can mentally leave behind the book that I am reading, at least while I am working.  This book, however, had me thinking about it while I was writing emails, picking up phone calls, working on projects.  It was a classic 'can't put it down' and I had to.  I kept trying to figure out ways to sneak a few pages at work.  <br />The plot is unusual and the finale is surprising.

The opening story is set on an estate in England in the years between the wars.  Money is easy, people are happy, a little girl is growing up spoiled.  I found my stomach turning over as i so eaily identified with this child and yet didn't like her.  What a combination!  Even though the book is divided up into three stories, the first story with the little girl sets the others in motion. <br />Then you hit the war and the book changes.  It is a graphic, painful depiction of the war in France - most notably the waste of human lives and history.  Think the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan.<br />The third story goes back to London, into the hospital wards during the war.  Back tot he little girl, grown up and trying to become a better person than a little girl.  Trying to atone.<br />I thought the book was very good, very well written.

We walk along streets and buildings that once were bombed, where people died, where people fought.  It is so easy to forget when the scars are so well hidden.  I am glad that writers like Greig remind us how lucky we are.  <br />Written as a first person narrative (ostensibly as the journals of the protagonanists), but taking the views of two people, it can occasionally be confusing as you jump from one persons thoughts to another without warning.  But the first person double narrative works in giving insight to two people as they fight for themselves, for us, for each other.  It is a love story and a war story.  You know these people.  They could be you, caught up in something world changing and horrifying.  It made me close my eyes and be thankful that they made these sacrifices so that I wouldn't have to.	2002-08-13

But no matter how much I recognized these charcters as people I knew, they were people I didn't want to know any better.

There are several narrators, several points of view, and an awareness that no one really knows the Truth.  The book sets itself in its own future, with the daughter reading an account of her life written by a now-dead mother.  What unfolds is the tale of a savage infatuation and brutal obsession horrifying enough as it is but even more horrifying to our 21st century eyes that now recognize these patterns as abuse.  That is the crux of the book.  Abuse was never spoken aloud, was never recognized, and lives were ruined because of it.  And we can sit here, with our fresh knowledge and be appalled.  It is good to know that we can now be appalled.	2002-05-24

I was amazed by the author's control over voice as perspective shifts from the protagonist to other characters and was moved by the horror that is drawn so well by the young voice recounting it.

They are the decendents of Roald Dahl and even as much as I am glad they are out there, I sometime wonder why there aren't more decendents of Frances Hodgson Burnett.  Where are the sweetly serious books?  This is one such decendant and more should be out there.  The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an absolutely wonderful novel of historical fiction that throws early America into stark light.  I read this book over and over when I was a child and though I have not read it in 15 or more years, I can still remeber the twists and turns of the plot.  History is rekindled through Kit (I can still remember her name), a young emigrant just come to America to start a new life far from her natice Barbados.  You see the grey winters, the hard working people whose religion shapes their daily lives, and the fear.  Speare brings a small part of reality to life.  And that is what is truly missing from so many modern children books.  I truly recommend this book to all kids who have a thirst for the past.	2002-05-10

Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book.  And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.<br />Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows.  This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery.  This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful.  It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been.  It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war.  I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends.  It is something different.  I loved it.	2002-05-10

The telling is very frank and the subject matter is shocking to those of us who have never had to experience it.  A desperate love for a mother who rarely reciprocated it and a physical affair with her long-lost father are described with such simplicity that the reader experiences the traumatic events with Harrison.  It was a fast read (I started and finished it on the train in one day) but a lasting impression on the brain.  Highly recommended as a reminder that great people can come from brutal beginnings; that an unhappy childhood isn't everyone's excuse.	2002-03-21

The Binding Chair was on a shelf of books at the airport and I grabbed it, having miscalculated the amount of reading material I would need.  And I found it wonderful.  Sometimes a multiple viewpoint story becomes broken and feels choppy to its readers.  But Harrison has the control over her stories to weave the different narrations, viewpoints, times and places together to produce an outstanding novel.  I have already recommended this book to my friends and family, as I think that this is a great book.  I am sure that it will linger in my mind for years to come.	2002-02-14

The book actually is a well-written, well-researched story of a disease that broke out at the beginning of modern medicine.  The frustrations of science, the seething underworld of ignorance, the personal stories of a few are combined into what is quite a gripping book.  It is not for the sqeamish, for sure, as disease is treated with the same careless facination that the society of the times felt, when disease was so much an ordinary occurance.  The author conveys the simultaneous resignation and horror of this particular disease very well.  It make you very glad to have been born so much later and makes you wonder what WE are doing wrong.	2002-02-12

I hadn't read Harris' first book Chocolat, but I enjoyed the movie.  When I feel asleep after reading the first few chapters, I knew I was in trouble.  Harris mixes together two stories, one from the protagonist's childhood and one from his present.  The chapters of story intersperse each other, one to one.  For me, this had the effect of pulling me out of each story, just as I was becoming involved.  I found that I wasn't concerned with the dilemmas of the novel (writing a second novel and reconciling his past), possibly because of the way the stories were constructed.  I finished the book simply because stories nag at me when I don't finish them.	2002-01-11

I have often said that she could write literature but has chosen to show the fiction market what a romance novel can and should be.  Lately, her publishers seem content to feed her audience republished stories from Nora's early days.  But the romance market has grown since the original publication of these stories (largely thanks to Ms. Roberts herself) and these stories seem old fashioned, even boring, now.  But this new trilogy catapults her right back on top of the heap.  She makes the romance real by focusing on the setting, on the characters, on the plot and the romance weaves its way from that.  How can anyone not warmed by the romance, entranced by the Magic (literal Magic) or be chilled by the evil she writes of?  Buy!  Read!  Enjoy!	2002-01-08

Some of the reviews I have seen have made comparisons to Harry Portter.  Do not be fooled.  These are VERY different books.  I bought them expecting the same warm and fuzzy feeling that the Harry books left me with but warm and fuzzy is not what Pullman writes about.  These books have a dark intensity that Harry does not and are clearly for an older more sophisticated audience.  Please don't buy these for an eight year old.  Buy them for your 28 year old.  Death, gore, fear and pain are all treated as part of life in a way that most children won't understand and a parent might not want to explain.  There is also love, loyalty, sacrifice and compassion in equal measure to the darkness.  The books explore the idea of soul, of religion, of god.  Very, very adult.  I read all three in a week and found them immensely gripping and moving.  I recommend them to anyone over 12.	2002-01-08

It has great pictures, simple instructions and covers a range of basics that fancier cookbooks assume you already know.  Like how long to boil an egg if you want a soft boiled egg or a hard boiled egg.  Or how to tell if an artichoke is done.  Or picture explanations of cuts of meat.  I recommend this for any novice in the kitchen as a good starter cookbook.  I buy it for friends whose mothers never had much time for the kitchen and so passed on little or no general knowledge.

Howard likes to create strong women whose vulnerability is societal in nature.  In other words, she is a psychic and gets no respect.  Her heros are also strong, warrior-like men whose only vulnerabilty is the heroine.  And her antagonists are real enough to be terrifying.

That said, I love this place that she creates.  It is a bit of old-school South, in that it seems like bad things are just bubbling under the surface, waiting to burst free.  This is the same world that Faulkner, Dickey, and Welty inhabit.  A world where human passions are often dark and where salvation is often not forthcoming.  But unlike the others, Gibbons's character's are frequently rescued from the pit by their relationships with family.

I love reading her books because it does make me feel like I have been to all of the places that she describes.  Actually, I HAVE been to all the places she has described, except the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.  But now it is on my wish list.  She has an amazing ability to make the reader love the place as much as she obviously does.  For the duration of the book, you are THERE.<br />That said, I didn't really enjoy much else of this book.  I knew, from the first Chapter, who committed the crime.  Not because anyone told me but because it was so formulaic.  I appreciate suspense, but I prefer Linda Howard's suspense, to Ms. Roberts.  All due respect to a very very good writer, of course.  <br />If you are new to Nora Roberts, I recommend the 'To Dream' series or the 'Born in' series, both of which display all of her strengths and none of her weaknesses.  If you know Ms. Roberts' work, this is not as strong as 'Montana Sky' or even 'Homeport' both of which I found to have the edginess that is needed for this genre.	2001-11-02

US	51285666	R1G6K13YXRBTYB	0679760806	778351106	The Master and Margarita	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A fine comic novel	I don't speak or read Russian, so I am unable to tell whether or not this was a true translation of the original.  What I can tell is that this translation is amusing, cynical, and smooth.  The book is much in the style of Catch-22, the same over-the-top ridiculousness to underscore a similar seriousness and futility.  I read this book on a vacation and never felt like I was being pretentious; it was just too much fun!	2001-10-31
US	51285666	R27QKJNJ1S3M7E	0375725784	381316770	A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Started with a bang and petered out	I really enjoyed the beginning of the book.  I found it gripping and interesting and read the first hundred pages in an hour.  And after that?  Well, I felt like this writer was just too fond of himself and so certain that once he explained himself, we would love him.  That sounds harsh, but I found that I read the second half of the book simply because I had already committed so much.  I am not recommending this.	2001-10-31
US	51285666	RRIDXUCKA8X4Z	0671034057	562966780	Now You See Her	Books	4	3	4	N	N	very very sexy	I have found that Linda Howard is the best author of romantic suspense out there.  Nora Roberts has her place, without a doubt, but no one has written better sex scenes in the Romantic Fiction genre.  To combine sex scenes worthy of Erotica with well paced suspense is a intense and gripping book.	2001-10-29

However, I do not buy her books any more.  They all seem to be the same (though some might argue that all romance novels are the same): feisty heroine meets strong, silent, mustached (yuck!) man and they fight for most of the book before she gives in to his manly libido AND somehow falls in love with him......yawn......	2001-10-29
US	51285666	R25F0DLFO1ID16	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The lost world	Books that recreate worlds that are largely lost to us can be hard to read.  Many people find history to be a rather dull subject.  But, in fact, Ms. Diamant has created not only an extremely readable tale but she has actually done it so well that I have found myself refering back to this book as if it is a history book rather than fiction.  An excellent rendering of and old testament story.	2001-10-24

And I am from South Carolina, so I should know good fried chicken!  I read this cookbook for fun, as the anecdotes along the side are so interesting and the pictures so mouthwatering.  I highly recommend this cookbook to moderately advance cooks.	2001-10-24

That was always my brother's realm.  But a friend encouraged me to pick up this trilogy and I always like to read my friends' recommendations.  I read all three of these books in a week.  The characters were interesting and well developed and the story kept branching further and further.  Hobb does not always give the reader what they want, plot-wise, but in the end she has created a better story for it.	2001-10-24

I have reread this trilogy of Ms. Roberts so many times that I have had to buy new copies.  She has created such well-rounded, interesting characters, that I sometimes have to visit with them again.  They feel like old friends.  It is a bit embarrassing to admit, but I missed them when I went to Ireland and they weren't there.  Very wonderful books about strong and interesting women and the romances that they discovered.	2001-10-24

One of the best recommendations for a book on writing, in my opinion, is that it creates the urge to write in everyone.  My mother bought me this book on a friend's recommendation when I was at a lag in my writing.  My mother read it as well and she needed to write.  So she began writing letters to her past acquaintances.  We have given this book to anyone with a mild interest in writing.  Every one of them has loved it and has sat themselves down at their computer aafter reading it.  What is better than that?	2001-10-24

I have never gotten her out of my head.  In fact, I have even visited Prince Edward Island to see the place that was the setting for so many of LMM's stories.  I would recommend this book to women of all ages.	2000-09-27

I recommend this book to anyone who may have even the slightest interest in the American Civil War and in the people (fictional and real) who lived through it.	1999-09-01
