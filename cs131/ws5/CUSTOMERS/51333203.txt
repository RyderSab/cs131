Is he real? Did the events depicted in this work actually happen, or were they fictionalized? Is the man who is currently teaching in the eastern US truly the same person depicted in this series? Does it even matter?<br />Regardless of the unanswered questions, whether the book is fact or fiction, the book is a treasure. It is one of the greatest Chinese historical (martial arts) epics ever published (in either english or Chinese), and also one of the most revelatory works about Taoism and Taoist thought and practice in print. It is moving in an indescribable way, directly addressing spiritual struggle, and questions of identity and purpose.	2004-06-04

Kalb is ridiculous.	Anyone who puts the brutish, relatively poorly skilled Shaq at the top of the list is missing more than half of his brains. Kalb, a stat geek, makes the cardinal sin of doing what should never be done: comparing players of different eras. It cannot be done. Example, he compares Bird vs. Erving based on a 1981 playoff matchup. At the time, Bird was approaching his prime, while Erving was already well past his. That's the kind of slippery thinking that is found throughout this book. <br />In the end, this is just one guy's subjective take, certain to anger scores of NBA fans and basketball historians.	2004-05-16

These 9/11 reseachers have been subjected to constant media attacks, but have bravely forged on. <br />Griffin's book, while certainly useful, sources some of the work of many of the earliest 9/11 researchers (who, to this day, deserve greater recognition). This reader suggests that you look at Griffin's sources, along with the work of other groundbreakers whose work is on the Internet, such as Michel Chossudovsky, Michael Ruppert (whose own book is upcoming), Dan Hopsicker, and investigators of physical evidence.	2004-03-21

Also richly detailed is the political conflict among Americans, between hate-spewing war-mongering politicians and media voices and opponents of the war.

This is an outrageous assertion, that Linn fails to support, while attempting to quietly paper over the history and repair the reputations of the Americans who killed a military disadvantaged opposition with brutality. Linn brushes off the butchery of Samar as no more than &quot;harsh&quot;, while pushing the idea that Filipinos actually welcomed the US. Linn's bias in support of &quot;benevolent assimilation&quot; is clear.

The details are a treasure trove. It must, however, be pointed out that Dillon's book, written in 1962, approached Chinatown (and the confluence of factors faced by the Chinese diaspora--poverty, clan rivalries, secret society conflicts, corruption, after-effects of China ravaged by war and turmoil, violent racism, and the criminal milieu of San Francisco that was NOT limited to Chinatown) from the standpoint of a Caucasian &quot;tourist&quot;. The lurid details are presented. Very little of the reason for the violence is given. did a better job than most historians of his generation, but clearly had no sensitivity to the deeper cultural factors. More recent explorations of Chinese-American history, which benefit from a modern outlook and more recent information (from China itself, for instance) do a better job explaining the &quot;why&quot; behind the violence of old Chinatown (which Dillon for the most part does not do). Still, this is an important history, and still one of the few that have focused specifically on the subject. It deserves a spot on the shelf next to Herbert Asbury's &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;.	2004-02-01

It is not a dry history, nor a polemic. It is beautiful, fresh and literary writing that reads like a novel, packed with ground-level observations, much gathered from the journals of the Western participants themselves. Fay also does a better job than many others in dissecting the psychologies behind the politics and clashing cultures. Fay also succeeds by never straying from the bottom line: the opium and opium trafficking.	2004-01-16

Both of Hu Sheng's histories, this one as well as his classic &quot;Imperialism and Chinese Politics&quot;, provide badly-needed purely Chinese perspective on modern Chinese history and China's struggle with the West from late Qing dynasty onward. Hu Sheng's attack is powerful, fresh, insightful, startling, and, yes, appropriately angry. The anecdotes and sources, taken from Chinese language histories, are extremely valuable, and largely unavailable in English language histories of China. Do not be put off with Hu Sheng's political affiliations. His views are shared by Chinese across the spectrum, all over the world. In a world in which establishmentarian Western scholars have so badly clouded, neutered,inculcated and &quot;made safe&quot; the history of China, and the Chinese side of the story, Hu Sheng's analysis is a treasure.	2003-12-08

In this epic account, drawing on overlooked and previously unpublished sources, Seagrave destroys longheld myths (that are still touted as \\"fact\\" by most western and Chinese scholars) and presents a startling and critical \\"flip side\\" reappraisal of the collapse of the Ching dynasty and the life of the eternally demonized Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi. The demented British propagandists, Edmund Backhouse and J.O.P. Bland, are finally exposed as liars and frauds whose blatant propaganda unfortunately helped define world opinion, and in turn agitated further western atrocities upon China and the Ching regime. Chinese operatives Kang Yu-Wei, and the legion of corrupt ultra-reactionary princes behind the throne (the true power in the late Ching), are also spared no quarter. Tzu Hsi herself is shown to be a somewhat ignorant hostage and figurehead, caught between Ironhat Manchu operatives wreaking havoc internally, and imperialist foreign powers intent on using all pretexts to carve open China and plunder it. More importantly, Seagrave provides evidence that virtually none of the hellish acts attributed to Tzu Hsi ever happened, and backs it up with convincing evidence. She was not the all-powerful and evil murderess and animal as depicted by scores of \\"world class\\" intellectuals and East Asian scholars (even Jonathan Spence) and generations of books and films glorifying Tzu Hsi's \\"reptilian evil\\". This, along with \\"Soong Dynasty\\", is an essential read for anyone who wants a starlingly clear view of late Ching-early Republic era China. Highest possible recommendation.	2003-11-07

Some important historical details are glossed over (and wrong in a few cases). At times, her observations are quite biased. As a longtime student of Chinese and Chinese-American history, I was somewhat disappointed that Chang did not \\"blow the covers off\\". Nevertheless, the book does serve as a good overview of the Chinese-American experience. Chang's contribution here is that she allows readers to see it from the viewpoint of a Chinese-American, and understand that the racism, struggle and bitter triumph of this experience is still ongoing. That is the theme that she does a good job underscoring with her choice of focus. The tone of her writing is \\"essay-like\\", not professorial or objective.	2003-10-26

And by Carr's own account, Ward was only partially successful. To thank him for his assistance (which ultimately helped maintain both Western imperial domination of China, the opium trade, and the extension of the corrupt and weak Qing empire), in a relationship of dual purpose, the Manchu Qing regime (not the Chinese people)gave him an official title and a Chinese wife. Carr's pro-Western bias is strong, as is his strange love of the Ward myth, which he does his best to overblow. Carr's sourcing is spotty, and in too many places, he speculates---typically in ways that favor Ward. This book, and indeed the Ward story itself, presents a very enlightening model of how violent rogue mercenaries, terrorists, and intelligence cutouts are used to assist governments in &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; wars throughout history, such as the Phoenix Program.	2003-09-24
