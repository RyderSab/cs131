This is also true for those historians. Most of the boods of \\" History of Mathematics \\" end in the beginning of 20th century. So we know very little about the conteporary mathematicians. This book can be described as a gap for it. After readiming this book, not only you have a knowledge about the life of the great mathemaitcians, you also get the period in World War II how Nazis forced those mathematicians out of Germany and the reason why U. S. A. is now the leading centre of mathematics.	2004-01-23

First I would like to congrulate the 109 years birthday of this superclassic of the classics! If anyone who study mathematics and wants to know how a book can be judged as a classics, this is the one !! The first of edition is in 1902!!!Perhaps no other mathematical textbook is more famous and useful than this one . Think about a book which can survive for almost a century and up to now still no other advanced reference book can replace it. Of course new theories emerged in the last decades and of course would not be included in this book. But the style Whittaker and Watson wrote this book that I have yet to find a similar book!! They wrote this classics in a concise style and prove the theorems in the most rigorous manner. The materials are both useful in pure and applied mathematicians. That is the reason why so many advanced (Noted I use the word advanced ) textbooks today still stated it as the book for further (or ultimate ) reference. I definitely agree with other reader's review on this book that this book is in the hall of fame and will be eternal. Everyone who want to pursue in mathematics MUST own that book. One pity is that we know very little about these two men. As the book only print out the authors' name and even don't even mention which university in which they chaired the professorship. For E. T. Whittaker, fortunately in his another classic book on dynamics, in that book there is a biography ( though just a brief one )written. Unfortunately, for G. N. Watson, even in his classic book on Bessel's function, none of a word about him.I hope in the future, when further reprint edition appears ( it will ), the publisher will provide at least a brief ( or course detailed ones is better ) biography about these two great mathematicians and teachers.( Brilliant mathematicians does not mean they are good teachers,think about the greatest giants like Newton or Gauss,if they were not enthusiastic in passing their knowledge to the next generations,the knowledgewould only be lost!!! ) In this aspect,only Euler,the \\" analysis incarnate \\", have done that. P.S., one can find the biographies of them in the \\"Dictionary of scientic Biography \\" of these two men.It is worthwhile to look at the biographies of these great teacher!!! Also, I think ,  there is no doubt that this book will survive for another 100 years!!![.]	2003-10-16

Though the book is 2.5 inch thick but do not think it consists of many pages as it consists of two books and so the two books actually containing just a bit over 600 pages.

What makes this book different other ones, I think it is the historical intuition of Boyer makes this book eternal. Some book arrange the content chronologically and somes book arrange the content according to the topics. However, Boyer cleverly combined that two . Also, he also extinctly discuss the topics proportional to their importance in the history. There is not too much mathematics and <BR>there is not too few mathematics, Just a few words to describe that is &quot; that book is really well balanced &quot; and gives you everything and also the range of audience is wide, coupled with the very very reasonable price, it is the book on mathematical history who are interested should own one.	2003-09-14

I am a fanatic mathematical fan of Euler,to me his the greatest mathematician of all time. Of course, you would challange me. How about Newton, Gauss, and Archimedes, the universally claimed 3 of the greatest mathematician of all time. But read more, I give Euler this honor is including all other aspects of his life, and not just on maths and his achievement. Euler enjoyed his life, his maths, he adventured maths, even with one eye blind followed by the other,he never gave up. Even under the bad relationship with Fredrich the Great, he still did what he should do and never involved in politics. He enjoyed his family, he was approachable, he helped mathematicians of new generation. ( He held up his paper on calculus of variation in order to give full credit to Lagrange was just one aspect ). He was humble, he almost had good relationship with all his contempory mathmaticians.

I think this book acutally fulfil the the titles it named. An \\"introduction ot the bessel functions, .\\" I have read other books on so called introduction ot certain subjects , say Riemann's Zeta Function, but actually the book is as difficult as a treatise book on that subject. In this book, the author acutually doing the good work. From the beginning, he defined <BR>the bessel function of order zero as a power series, Don't ask why, just accept the facts. Then he gradually presents more facts about Bessel functions without rigorous proof. That is good!! Before mastering the subject, just accept the facts and in the future, if you want to know more about Bessel functions, you have already have a certain background knowledge about that. <BR>If you read Watson's timeless classic \\" teatise on  \\"bessel function\\", not only you will get stucked and you may lose interest to that as well.

From that not only we can have a more  thorough understanding to what Riemann originally thinked and developed his famous function and this also serves as  a respect to Riemann, one of the three greatest mathematicians of modern times!!

I brought this book ( volume 2 also as well ) because of its &quot; fame &quot;, but when I read it, it has several draw backs. First, may be the original vesion is in German, so even with good translation, it seem does not fit in the usual English style we get used to .Also the topics it choose is too few and also the area covered is too narrow and not well co-ordinated. For example, the whole volumme I is almost dedicated to Calculus of variation only. In volume 2, the whole book is dedicted to differentiation equations. But that is not the greatest drawback. The most bad point is that the book just presents formulae after formulae, equations after equations, without giving examples of how to use it,and also no exercise for me to practice.

Think about a book which can survive for almost a century and up to now still no other advanced reference book can replace it.

They wrote this classics in a concise style and prove the theorems in the most rigorous manner. The materials are both useful in pure and applied mathematicians. That is the reason why so many advanced (Noted I use the word advanced ) textbooks today still stated it as the book for further (or ultimate ) reference. I definitely agree with other reader's review on this book that this book is in the hall of fame and will be eternal. Everyone who want to pursue in mathematics MUST own that book. One pity is that we know very little about these two men. As the book only print out the authors' name and even don't even mention which university in which they chaired the professorship. For E. T. Whittaker, fortunately in his another classic book on dynamics, in that book there is a biography ( though just a brief one )written. Unfortunately, for G. N. Watson, even in his classic book on Bessel's function, none of a word about him.I hope in the future, when further reprint edition appears ( it will ), the publisher will provide at least a brief ( or course detailed ones is better ) biography about these two great mathematicians and teachers.( Brilliant mathematicians does not mean they are good teachers,think about the greatest giants like Newton or Gauss,if they were not enthusiastic in passing their knowledge to the next generations,the knowledgewould only be lost!!! ) In this aspect,only Euler,the \\" analysis incarnate \\", have done that. P.S., one can find the biographies of them in the  \\"Dictionary of scientic  Biography \\" of these two men.It is worthwhile to look at the biographies of these great teacher!!! Also, I think ,<BR>there is no doubt that this book will survive for another 100 years!!![.]	2001-08-01
