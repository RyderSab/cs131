I read about 3/5 of that one about pirates but was so uninvolved and bored that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. And this book, I think I made it about 150 pages before admitting defeat and giving up. There's some thing about her writing style that just bores me and it feels like a struggle just to make it through. <br /> <br />I know that this review will get about 0 out of 20 votes for helpfulness because everyone else who reviewed this book seemed to love it.  <br /> <br />I guess I'm writing to tell that small percentage of people out that, who like me, just don't like Celia Rees's books either, that this book bored me and I was easily distracted from it. <br />	2005-09-25

Did I enjoy it? Yes. Was it the best book I've ever read? No. <br /> <br />Mel goes to court and becomes a popular lady with many suitors. All the while she is trying to decide if Shrevraeth (was that his name?) would make a good king or if this other woman whose name I fail to recall would be a better leader. That part of the book wasn't very exciting and I felt that Mel wasn't doing very much good.  <br /> <br />Let's be honest. The only reason people stuck around was to read about the developing romance between Shrevraeth and Mel. We endure 200 pages of Mel trying to convince herself that she hates him. How will things turn out between them? Who is the mysterious suitor sending her letters? Hmm..  <br /> <br />Yes this book was very predictable and the conclusion was a bit dull. I know I sound very negative but I did like this book. It just didn't astound me with it's brilliance like it did for some other reviewers. <br /> <br />I am sounding lucid? I'm tired and don't want to keep writing. <br /> <br />Yes anyway, I liked the book. It was good but not wow, yippee, this is the greatest book ever, good. At least not to me.	2005-09-11

I wish I could read the next book in the series right now. That is my main problem with this series. If it takes 2 years for the next book to come out, by then I'll be nearly 17. I'm worried that I'll forget about these books or feel too old to read them then. <br /> <br />Ah well, focusing on the present I loved this book. I rarely buy books unless I really want them, and I couldn't wait 2 months for the library to get this book. I bought it and read it in about 5 hours. So, if you enjoy books with magic, romance, horror and mystery, this is a perfect blend of those elements. What makes it even more interesting and appealing is that it is set in the Victorian era.  <br /> <br />I'm sick of singing it's praises.I enjoyed the book. I recommend it. You should read it.	2005-09-05

I'll admit that I groaned out loud at some of the simularities between this book and the lord of the rings. The vocabulary was also annoying. I consider myself to have a good vocabulary but the guy wrote the book like he looked every word up in the thesaurus and picked the hardest words. Maybe it's because I haven't taken the SATs yet that I didn't know some of these words, but please.  <br /> <br />Anyway, having pointed out the flaws, I must say that this was an exciting and enjoyable read. I read so many boring books that I don't care if this book isn't perfect. Whatever you say about it, it was by no means boring. I think people are being too critical of the author. I read the book for entertainment and I enjoyed reading it. What else do you want from a book?  <br /> <br />If you want a plot summary than you can read the professional one, but this is my opinion. Try not to be so critical of this book and you will enjoy it. It's worth reading. <br />	2005-08-29

Yet, there were parts of it that I really didn't enjoy. Like the all too vivid butchering of people. I also don't know what type of book I would catagorize this as. Other reviewers were dissapointed because of how little history that was in it. There was a lot of prophetic dreaming which made it feel like fantasy to me, but i guess it is a part of the Native American culture.  Whatever else I say about this book, it was a good story but felt a bit unrealistic at times.

I love the entire series of Harry Potter books, yet I don't believe that my years of devotion to the series has clouded my judgement when I say that this is a terrific book. <br /> <br />Harry is now returning to Hogwarts to begin his sixth year. The wizarding community is now aware of Voldemorts return and terror is beginning to reign. Harry is a marked man and every thing now feels as if it is leading up to the final comfrontation between himself and Voldemort. We learn a lot of new things about Voldemort.  <br /> <br />This summary is very hard to write as I don't want to spoil anything as I know I would be furious if someone spoiled the story for me...  <br /> <br />Things of great importance take place and we learn something new that adds to and intensifies the burden already placed on Harry's shoulders. <br /> <br />I don't want to say anything more but this wa sa very good addition to the series. If there is someone out there like a few friends I have who have tried the books and been put off by the rather slow start of the first book and been discouraged from reading them ever since I encourage you to try again. You are missing out on some really great books, and they can be hard to come across, hidden amongest some of the forgettable books I read to satisfy my thirst for a book. <br /> <br />This is a great book. Any Harry Potter fan has to read it and any one who isn't a Potter fan by now, I encourage to give the books a chance.	2005-08-04

It's right up there with Philip Pullman's Dark Materials Trilogy and Harry Potter. The only thing dissapointing about this book is that it is the end of the series. <br /> <br />The book picks right back up where Lirael left off. I recommend reading the series in order starting with Sabriel and then Lirael to fully enjoy it. So Lirael, having finally discovered her true destiny after a life time of longing for what she can never have, has set out with her companions Prince Sameth, Mogget, and the Disreputable dog. They are forced to comfront the greatest challenge hoisted on anyone since the very beginning. <br /> <br />You know what, I'm terrible at writing summaries and if I keep telling you about the book, why would you want to read it? <br />All I can say is that this book is excellent and passing it by would be a big mistake, as I myself came close to doing.  <br />Anyone could enjoy this series regardless of what type of book he or she normally reads. This series deserves the wild popularity that the Harry Potter books have attained because they are just as good. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the entire trilogy.	2005-08-03

This is the sort of book to keep you up all night reading when you have school the next day and several tests to take. You won't even care because it is definatley worth staying up all night to finish it.<br /><br />Sabreil creates a totally unique and new world unlike any other book I've read. The idea behind it is that there are nine gates and stages of Death and untill you have reached the ninth gate you are not truly dead and a necromancer can bring you back as an evil spirit and enslave your soul. A person called the Abhorsen is like a necromancer but puts spirits to rest and dispells evil spirits.<br /><br />Sabriel's father is the Abhorsen but when he goes missing she must become the new Abhorsen and she sets out to find him. She joins her companions Mogget and Touchstone and they set out to find Sabriel's father.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book and although I was dubious while reading it in the beginning I was soon hooked and it is one of my favorite books now. You may think that you son't like fantasy and will not like this book but it has something to offer to everybody and I encourage you to read it.	2005-06-27

In a lot of teen books the main characters do such stupid  things that I could never imagine doing and I wonder if the author thinks that teens are stupid or if they're trying to teach me a lesson.

How believable is it that she was writing in her journal while having a conversation so it would all be recorded? I once read a book entirely written through aim and text messages and one through letters! It gets incredibly annoying after a while. Nothing happens in the present or at least a semblance of it, they talk about what happened in short, choppy bits and the plots gets all mixed up.    Anyway....  The plot was silly but might have been enjoyable but, it wasn't. It was boring. The end was quite exaggerated. The romantic couple had known each other for what, 2 weeks and they decide that they're in love and he gets a tattoo honoring her.    I'll stop ranting now but this book wasn't worth reading, really.	2005-06-17

This guy was a sick, abusive, stalker. His ex-girlfriend who has a restraining order against him, dropped her pen and he kept it and liked to put it in his mouth and bring it everywhere. <br /> <br />Eww! Sick! loser! <br /> <br />Through his jounal entries you learn how he goes from loving his girl friend to becoming suspicious of her and controlling and abusive. He eventually gives her such a beating, and in public, that she can't forgive him. <br /> <br />This was highly unpleasant subject matter and I read two silly, girly books after it to calm myself down. Yet, this teaches an important lesson and I won't easily forget it. <br /> <br />A book about an abusive boyfreind about to violate his restraining order and land himself in prison may not sound like a fun book to read, and it's not, but I don't regret reading it. <br /> <br />So, creepy, disturbing, and scary, but with a good lesson.	2005-06-17

I would recommend it to most audiences as it is highly entertaining no matter what your reading preference is.<br /><br />I must say that the ending was a bit weak in comparision to the highly thought out intricate plots previously foiled in the series.

This book is about stereotypes and hardships that people face, but please who really cares so much about hair color. <br /> <br />When Annisa moved from New Jersey to Florida no one likes her because of her (oh no) straight brown hair. What a terrible hardship to have. She was so brave not to dye it blonde. All the cheerleaders hate her and her new life in Florida is going terribly. <br />However by the end she has managed to make all the cheerleaders love her and the squad bonds and manage to win the regionals.  <br /> <br />Oh what a truly inspiring tale of overcoming hardship and woe. I wish I could be a cheerleader. I wish all the cheerleaders would love me and invite me to throw toilet paper at my rival school. <br /> <br />This book might be able to teach a meaningful lesson to those under 10 who prefer T.V. to books. However, this book was an insult to my intelligence and I believe it has high chances of being made into a Disney channel orignal movie one day. I just love disgustingly soppy, corny, unrealistic, predictable, brain frying, pom pom waving, perfect endings don't you? <br /> <br />I'm a tad bit bitter over having read this book.  <br /> <br />At absolute best I could call this light fluff.  <br />	2005-05-27

The entire book I'd known exactly what would happen to her but it was still horrible. Reading this I discovered exactly what Anne was really like. Over the course of her two years in hiding Anne matures from a spoiled superficial girl to a philosophical one who really thinks about things.<br /><br />The humdrum and sometimes amusing or terrifying activities and experiences of the people living in the \\"Secret Annex\\" became very familiar to me and having all those people who I'd grown so used to brutally killed off, with their deaths described in 2 pages was quite horrifying.<br /><br />Anne Frank was very headstrong and opinionated. I'm sure if she had lived she could have been the excellent writer that she always aspired to be. This book was incredibly moving and really made it clearer than ever how disgustingly pointless and horrible the Holocaust really was.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most truthful books I will ever read and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-28

It's the story of a girl who disguised herself as a boy to escape an unwanted marriage.  But, Elfwyn, this girl has no self confidence, no spunk and I found myself feeling bored as I followed the story of her half hearted attempts to escape and find herself. The climax of the book proves that she is yielding and supports the king who wanted her to marry a man old enough to be her grandfather. I was dissapointed by this book as a story, but  I'm sure as another reviewer remarked that the historical information in this book was interesting even if I personally did not appreciate it. <br />I think I might be a little too old for this book as it is recommended for ages 9-12.

It deals with the many problems in today's society including drugs, racism and poverty. It is mainly the story of a racist young boy who spends time with a prostitute/drug addict and her boyfriend (also a drug addict) who murdered both his parents. I consider reading to be a hobby of mine. However, I derived no enjoyment from this book, granted it is well written and contains many important messages but it was also harsh and a depressing read.

If I could have fiercly stabbed his character to death I believe I wouldn't hesistate in doing so. The person he loved more than  any thing and his only reason for living died yet I can feel no pity at all for him.<br /><br />This book was to me horrifing. I gave it 4 stars because I will NEVER forget it. Such a sequence of terrible, cruel events inflicted by one person in a life long pursuit of vengence goes beyond words. The depth of the sorrow of the characters and pain in this book amazes me. I can barely believe that this was publised in 1847, it does not startle me at all to learn that it did not do well at first.<br /><br />As you read this book you feel as if every decent thing is being obliviated and sucked off the face of the earth and you're left only with cruelty, pain and a longing for revenge.<br /><br />This is by no means a light read.

Lots of girls at my school reads the gossip girl series.  So, I decided to read the first book. Yet.. it was so menial compared to other books that I've read. I understand why it has other people my age who normally don't read for fun, reading it. That's a good thing. But it's like a tv show like the O.C. or something on paper. It has no lasting meaning behind it.    The plot is basically :  A bunch of rich people going to parties, being nasty to each, wearing expensive clothes and (what do you know..) gossiping.    Mildly entertaining. But if I wanted that I could just as easily watch TV or see a movie, a bad movie.

The book was made less enjoyable beacuse we had to diessect every characters emotion and there every move.<br /><br />It's just such a great idea to take such a seroius issue and act it out with farm animals. The pig Snowball, is evil, like Stalin. It is a great satire. we watched the movie in class after reading the book. It was terrible. Animal ends bleakly and is very sad. The movie stars a dog of very little importance in the book. The movie ended reasonably happily as well. The deep meanings are completely lost in it.<br /><br />The book is a profound read. You may need to know who the animal characters represent according to their real life counter parts.<br /><br />Full of treachorous plotting, back stabbing, and intruige it was a memorable book if not quite a bit depressing.	2005-03-05

It was to me, boring. I read about half untill I got distracted by another book and forgot all about this one. I returned it to the library and I haven't wondered about the ending at all. <br /> <br />If you did not read the other books you'll probably be very confused and bored reading this one. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it which is very unusual for me.  <br /> <br />I didn't enjoy it.	2005-03-05

So, I chose Dandelion wine.    I was 12 then and I struggled through every page not understanding the plot or signifigance at all. To me it was a bunch of stories about different people in one town haphazardly thrown together with no discernable connection.    Maybe if I were to read it again today I could appreciate it better or at least understand it. But I was tormented by such extreme and utter boredom page by tedious page 2 years ago that I still loathe it with a vigorous passion.    The best experience I had with Dandelion Wine was using it to swat a particularily pesky mosquito.	2005-03-05

You basically know what is going to happen, what the ending will be. <br />It was some what enjoyable, although so long winded at times that I felt like screaming. <br /> <br />Not a memorable book but sufficently entertaining. <br /> <br />The conclusion was dissapointing.	2005-03-05

I only read one other book in the series before this and maybe that's why I couldn't appreciate the ending. Any thing that could go right did go right, i'm not pessimistic or anything but how many fantasticly happy events can you cram into 1 chapter? The ending was just way too fairy tale-ish for me. Like a disney channel original movie or any show on hallmark or pax. For me it was just too unbelievable and way too corny. <br /> <br />But.. if you like that kind of stomach churningly sweet ending then you'll be sure to enjoy this book. <br />For me it was a quick read but I wouldn't read it again.	2005-03-05

Was I dissapointed? Well.. <br />I've read it cover to cover 3 times now and I didn't like it as much as he previous books. It can be very long winded at times and harry doesn't even get to hogwarts untill about the 200th page. Harry spends alot of time screaming at his friends and making stupid mistakes that eventually lead to something terrible. <br /> <br />If you are a harry potter fan you have to read it. I read it in 2 days when it came out. It gives crucial information about harry and there are memorable new characters. <br /> <br />But overall... for being what..700 pages long... not very much happened.	2005-03-05

I thought for sure it was going to be 300 pages of heart warming boredom all about frolicking with cuddly dolphins. <br /> <br />It suprised me by being a very good book with lots of deeper meanings in it. How to deal with the death of a friends father and her grandfathers illness? Or what to do about the reckless rich boy who had attached himself to her?  <br />I ended up liking the main character and the book. <br /> <br />It is a worthwhile read.	2005-03-05
