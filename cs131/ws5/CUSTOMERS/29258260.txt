Questions flash through your mind - does anyone ever come to their senses? Can't they just accept Quillan? Will he and Carina ever be together again? My heart ached, and rejoiced while I read this book. Though, I must say, the author did a splendid job at making one get extremely involved with the lives of the characters.

Well, as you know if you've read the first book(if you haven't you are VERY NAUGHTY), Quillan is having trouble allowing himself to love his wife, Carina.

Anyway, Carina has just left California - her home, and also the home of her fiance, Flavio, whom she had just caught with her sister, Divina. She flees to Crystal, Colorado, a small mining town she has high hopes for, and a place where she hopes to forget her sorrow over Flavio. Anyway, right when she gets to Crystal, she is severely dissappointed - a roguish freighter named Quillan Shepard pushes nearly all of her belongings straight off a cliff, someone takes over her house, and she has no money. Even worse, the goody goody of the town, Berkely Beck, likes her. Mr. Beck you'll discover, is not the kind gentleman that first greets Miss DiGratia, and has his own dark secrets that threaten the town, and Carina. Quillan, however, has a different story. His true self hidden by a dark and forbidden past, he appears to be quite the scoundrel, but later on, he and Carina are to find themselves struggling together to save Crystal. Here are some questions that might be stumbling along in your mind: What is Beck hiding?? Do Quillan and Carina ever fall in love?? Are they able to save Crystal??

I guess that's a lot of why I admired this book, but there's more of a reason. This story shows the true meaning of happiness: family love and hard work. <br />Polly Milton is a fourteen year old little girl who goes to say with a rich family in town. She's friends with Fanny who is only two years older and who's only interests are boys, fashion, and parties. Tom is Fanny's brother who is Polly's age, and is the perfect little trouble and mischief maker, and the littlest, Maud, is on the verge of being like Fanny. Polly comes from a poor family where she has learned to love and cherish everyone and everything, impecible manners and politeness, to work hard, and to be the most loveable thing ever. With her sweet ways, she brings the brother and sisters of this family closer, shows their father how to love his children, gives Grandma the love and attention she always needed, attracts a young gentleman, and accomplishes everything she sets out to do. Happy, sweet, gentle Polly. When she grows older she becomes a music teacher. At 18, she finally gets interested in men and parties(but not too interested - she just pipes in once and a while) when Fanny is sick to death of it all. But, soon the family turns bankrupt and turn to Polly, who leads them to this...relizing that family was the only thing they ever really needed, not their money or finery. They learn the wonderfulness of hard work as I did through reading this story, and the importance of family. <br />This book shows how we should all be, and how its just fine to not grow up too fast. Don't worry girls, there's romance at the very end too! But, truth to tell, you don't need romance to entertain you in this heartwarming story.	2003-11-30

I don't want to ramble on and on about how much I LOVED THIS BOOK, but I've got to say a few things at least. This book was sooo sweet, and was action packed, and made characters seem so real that they jumped out of the page when they spoke. In ways, I know that I can relate to Sarah. I love it when authors create charachters that I can relate to. It makes the book so much more enticing, and they can so easily put your feelings into words.      The story is about Sarah Prine, an 18-yr-old Texas-girl who is \\"pioneering\\" to Arizona Territory. She suffers lots of hardships, like family memebers dying, friends dying, indian attacks, stuff like that. Well, guarding the wagon train is the handsome(yet one whom Sarah despises)cavalry officer named Captain Jack Elliot who has lost his heart to her. When they settle down in Arizona, Sarah marries an old family friend name Jimmy, entering into a loveless marraige.Later on, the book gets so so much better resulting from a certain change of events. Yay! But, a word of warning, all you emmotional readers, beware. The ending of this book left me bawling like a baby. I probably shouldn't be telling this or you'll all expect something, but I can't help it...I don't know how Sarah lived through what happened. It simply tore my heart out. That is a real compliment to the author...it's great reading books where the characters are so real it's like you met them,and loved them. Its like the people are out of the pages and in the real world and they live and breathe and talk right in front of you.      This book was simply marvelous and I would recommend it to every girl i know. it's very character building! Read this book!	2003-11-03

The two go on loving each other throughout the rest of their lives, even though they haven't seen eachother since those earlier days, and even though they find others to love along the ways.

This was one of the most heartwarming, touching, most precious stories I've ever read. What I loved most about it(apart from the lovely and poetical way of writing), was how Aldrich wrote the story of Abby's whole life, and not just the romance era like most authors do. I never would have considered that old people are never really old, it's just that they have outgrown what the rest of us are still waiting to grow into; that they once had lives with romance and accomplishments and thing of their own, had I not read this book. Well, anyways, the story goes like this: <br />Abby Mackenzie is eight years old when she moves to a little community with her family, and meets Will Deal. Well, all her young life, Abby has been told the story of her aristocratic father married her peasant mother, putting the rest of the family into peasantry. Her dream is to be like her aristocratic grandmother, Isabel Anders-Mackenzie, who has a portrait which Abby has only seen in her imagination.<br /> Well, when Abby grows older, she is courted by the dashing young doctor, Ed Mathews, who proposes while her friend Will is off at war. She thinks that if she marries him, she will have the chance to pursue all the dreams of being a fine lady, especially enriching her lovely singing voice. But, then Will comes home, and Abby marries  him, realizing that he was the one she really loved. So, the newly weds pioneer-on-over to Nebraska Territory, where they raise a family.<br /> The rest of the story tells of their life on the prairie, and how Abby is able to live her dreams through her children instead of herself.

Thom is so intimate in his vivid writing, that you can more than just picture the image, but actually live it...even if it's not the most pleasant depiction ever! <br />The story goes as 23yr old Mary Ingles lives a happy life in the Virginia Mountains. Comfortably she lived with her loving, dear husband, and her two little boys. She is pregnant with her third baby when they come. One July day, Mary and her children are captured by Indians, leaving behind her heart-broken  husband, and a terrible, bloody and gorey massacre. For several weeks they travel, all the way up the New River/Ohio  (O-Y-O)River. That's about 800miles! Poor Mary suffers terrible things in Shawnee-Town, and is traded to a Frenchman, who takes her another 2-300 miles up the river, away from home. Then, with another captive named Ghetel, she escapes one day. The rest of the book depicts the terrible, awful, merciless hardships she suffers on her 1,000 mile journey home. <br />The way Thom wrote this book, you can feel her terrors, her cuts, the starvation, and you can even taste some pretty disgusting things she had to eat. If you can't stand the most intimate details you've ever heard of, then don't read this book, for at times it may disgust you.

Miscaraiges, deaths, kidnaps, and un-faithfulness are very depressing, but keep you literally glued to the page. I myself, was really dissapointed in the ending, but that didn't stop me from loving this sepectacular book.	2003-09-03

I was TEACHING MY HISTORY teacher about the Boston Massacre after I was done! This was my very first Rinaldi book, and for a while it was my favorite book in the world! This entriguing story got me hooked on reading. I got up to 10,000 pages in 4 months. Yep, it'll get you started! But anyways, Rachel Marsh is a humble nanny to the children of John and Abigail Adams. Everything in her life is comfortable...the home is nice, the children are wonderful, and she is treated by her emploers much better than a simple servant. Then, they come. One day, fleets of British troops invade Boston, and that's where Rachel meets and befriends Private Mathew Kilroy. After the Boston Massacre happens, Rachel must make a descision...break off her friendship with Mathew and remain with the Adams, or continue to be his friend and be fired! This story is so real, it almost depresses you in the sad parts. I really loved this book, and would HIGHLY RECCOMEND it to anyone!	2003-08-19

I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT!	2003-08-17

There can't be many books better than this one!. What I love, is how real all the characters are, and the magic in Anne's imagination. Some things she says are just like poetry, and some things are hilarious! Anyways, there is a little redheaded, freckled, scrawny orphan girl named Anne Shirely. When the girl (by mistake)ends up in a house with an old bachelor, Mathew, and his old-maid sister, Marilla, she discovers love, comfort, and other wonderful things to feed her imaginative soul. Anne's story (in this book) lasts about four years, in which she meets a whole bunch of friends, including her very best, Diana Barry. She gets in and out of terrible scrapes like intoxicating friends, and dyeing her hair, but she also does good things like saving sick and dying children, and coming to the top of her classes. But, every story has a young man...in this case, the handsome Gilbert Blythe, who Anne doesn't really like in any case. Until later...but anyways, you'll have to read this AMAZING book to find out more!	2003-08-17

When I picked it up, I expected to find some innocent romance, and lots of reading about Germany. But, what I found was somewhat different. Read this, and you'll find that Patty has some immoral moments(and consider the reading level too!), and way too much time in Paris, and not enough in Germany. The book was way good accept for those points. I really liked the background info as far as that goes. I would NOT highly reccommend this, but if you can stand immorality, then go ahead and read it!	2003-08-06

To tell you the truth, it wasn't one of the best Ann Rinaldi books I've ever read, but hey, it passes. Fifteen year-old Hannah Chelmsford has a mixed up life: a seperated family we could call it. Her father is a mean old man who won't allow either Hannah or Abby(his oldest daughters) to marry who they wish, he won't let his son Lawrence marry or paint, and his youngest son he hates beyond all things.

Alice, the main characer, has an attitude of the \\"Northern\\" Scarlett O'hara. I love that attitude! Meaning, it's VERY flirtatious, gets into romantic pickles, and uses the funniest phrases and things like \\"Charlie is as independent as a hog on ice.\\" <br />The story goes as a newly wed who has just had her husband, Charlie, enlist in the Union army, and is left behind on a farm with his sour old mother. Alice gets bored of seeing only women, and flirts alot toward the handsome Mr. Smead, who takes it for more than she intended. He tries to take advantage of her and things like that(which makes her hate him more than anything) and unfortunately gets his way. Alice goes through a hard life during those two and a half years, including the accusation of murder, frostbite, and a whole lot more to keep your nose caught between the pages.<br /> This book was definately my favorite - I couldn't love a story better! It has romance, funny phrases, and will most definately make you laugh until your stomach hurts! Even under the humor, sweet and sad things are also folded between the remarkable pages of ALICE'S TULIPS!	2003-07-22

So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton. It's really good, and really hard too! Consider it a big accomplishment to have read it, cause it is amazing!	2003-07-07

I learned a whole lot. Well, you probably want to hear the story now, so here it goes: Annie Brown has been called by her father (the famous John Brown) to be the \\"watchdog\\" of his little hideout. The deal is, he is planning this raid at Harper's Ferry, to show his views on slavery. So, he is housing about 20 or so men in this house, and Annie is assigned to watch on the porch to see if anyone comes by and finds out. Well, that dreadful raid holds a sadness down on Annie: it threatens to seperate her and her love/fiance, Dauphin Thompson. So, it's really sad. Especially when you hear about the raid results. You are practically depressed yourself when you find out about what happens to Annie's fiance, brothers, and simply the men she grew attached to at the cabin. It's SO sad! Well, that is what makes it even more worth reading. I guarrantee you'll love this, so read it!	2003-07-01
