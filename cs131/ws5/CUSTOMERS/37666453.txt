I really loved this book when it came out, and wish the authors would get together to update both the material in the book and the software that came with it to run on 'modern' computing equipment, (this was written when DOS was still king!)  The book provided a really good, hands-on approach to fractal theory.  It is a little light on application, but wasn't meant to have any of that, so I can forgive and forget.  Moving down through to the borders of a Mandlebrot or Julia set in 16bit colour was amazing, and I would love to see what it would look like in the 16 million + colours available on computers today!	2005-06-21

The author, a product of his era most definitely, has an interesting way of writing that to the modern ear seems somewhat stilted and very 'proper'.  The content of the book however is really where it is at...This is the only book on sundials that I am aware of that was truly written by and for amateurs.  The author describes a number of different dials, as well as methods of designing and constructing them.  So far, this is much like any other book on sundials I had seen.  He then goes on to describe certain modifications and experiments he conducted, and some additional dials he designed, (and how they were designed.)  He juxtaposes the (in hindsight obvious,) facts of the relationship between knowing the time and knowing your position, (this of course was a major driver behind the invention of the portable timepiece.)  This book is very hard to find, and when you do it is usually very expensive.  (I saw it on Abebooks recently for around USD $70!)  If you can find it, and are interested in sundials, and like the author, feel that there is still something that can be learned about them then this is the book for you.	2005-06-20

I have started up a company of my own in the past, and plan to do so again in the future.  After having read Dr. Bakan's book as well as \\"Big Vision, Small Business\\" by Jaimie Walters, I have definitely changed my mind about HOW to set it up and run it!.

I bought this book the other day, as I have often wondered exactly how boolean logic got instantiated in electronic devices, but couldn't seem to get past the first few pages of most intro texts.  The author's style of writing is very engaging, and easy to follow.  I was able to get through the first couple chapters sitting in the book store!  I am looking forward to finishing the book, as it promises to provide me with a good grounding in this area.  The biggest difference I saw in this book was the careful stepping from boolean logic at a simple level to more complex logic while simultaneously showing how it can work in circuit-form.  Most books give the basics, then jump right into the circuit design as if you already get how to make the leap, (and I couldn't seem to get there on my own!!!)	2005-05-30

The book is a manual for building a computer out of paperclips, screws, wire and other odds and ends, (not a transistor, resistor or capacitor to be found!)  It has complete parts lists, give a short history of the computer and descriptions for constructing and putting together the components.  This isn't a fully complete computer in that it still needs a human to move data around a bit, but otherwise is quite neat.  This would form the basis for a very cool science fair project!  There is only one other book similiar in nature, available at [...] for free as a PDF or MS Word download.  It skips over minor details like step-by-step instructions on how to build each component, (like Alcosser's book does,) but actually results in a more complete system.  The two books together could be used to build a very simple, but working, digital computer useful for exploring the dawn of what is a fundamental tool of our society.	2004-10-01

While this book was clearly written by the author at least in part to placate his own ego, the basic concepts he touches on in the book are golden. The book is divided roughly into two parts; the first section describes how Mr. Yates feels the work-world will be divided up into basic categories like Knowlege-workers ,Service-workers, and the equivalent of the Assembly worker. He even points out that some jobs, at first glance might be considered knowlege worker, where in reality they are Assemby-line jobs. (some types of lawyers etc.) The second portion of the book discusses what it takes to become successful both in your personal life and your work life by embracing and improving on 8 key character traits or factors. He also brings in a third concept that each of us should have three 'jobs' simultaneously, (each of which focuses on a different combination of the 8 traits.) These three 'jobs' are; core career, entrepreneurial career, and dream career. Into the mix is thrown the idea that you should also balance your personal life with your work life.<br />All in all, the book was well written, although you had to dig occasionally to pull the really good stuff out into the open. I'd recommend this as a good reference for anyone who wants to ensure that they remain fresh in whatever their current job is and who is interested in working toward that 'Dream job' they really would rather be doing!	2004-04-08

Note the present tense here, as this is a book I often pick up and re-read sections of.  The first time I read part of it a few years ago, I found it very 'academic' and thought it difficult to understand, but that was before I began to practice aikido.  Since them, I still find it a little 'bookish', but now have some physical experience to match with what the authors were attempting to describe.  I think that this is one of the only books that attempts to systematize aikido training, or at least systematize some of the various techniques used in aikido.  It provides a great under-pinning to ones mat-work by putting a bit of theoretical base and structure to what you learn while on the mat.  I only gave this a 3-star because I think it could do with a bit of spruce-up given that it has been over 20 years since it was first published, and much has happened in the world of aikido since then.  This is definitely not a work that a beginner will get much out of at first, but should be part of any serious practitioner's collection!	2004-04-05

A lot of other reviewers have said it before, but this book is great!  I've read a number of other books by Alan Weiss, and find his advice to be definitely on the mark.  I've heard that the definition for something being unique as 'when you see it, you think....&quot;but that's so simple, why didn't I think of it!&quot;'  This book and it's advice fits that definition to a tee.  Mr. Weiss writes in a very easy-to-read style that engages and encourages the reader to keep reading more.  His advice IS common sense, but only seems so after you've read it.  I would, (and have, repeatedly!) recommend this book highly to anyone either actively involved in consulting work or peripherally related to it in some way.	2004-04-05

This one is for any senior exec. who would like to see a way, (but not necessarily the only way,) to organize their company for success into the new millenium.  The author makes some very good cases for his vision of the new company structure, one which I personally think is both workable and think makes sense.  While he doesn't necessarily provide a clean blue-print for re-organizing or building from scratch, he does give a great thumb-nail sketch that any reasonably intelligent business leader or entrepreneur could follow.

This book really cuts to the chase by showing you one means of putting information together in a way that senior manangement at many firms want to see it.  It doesn't advocate skipping out on researching all the details of a standard proposal, but it does say that most of what constitutes a typical proposal today is way too much information for a decision document.  Mr. Riley makes a good case for telegraphing the information down to the bare essentials of what is needed to make a decision.  The rest of the detail one typically finds in a proposal will find its way into the appropriate hands once the proposal has been accepted, but is only IN a proposal now to back up the core arguments!  I enjoyed Mr. Riley's method of laying out the idea, and while I found the name-dropping a bit excessive at times, on the whole think that the worth of what he is attempting to get across far exceeds the pain caused by such small matters.	2003-05-04
