Don't buy this book...unless you are over 50 and want to look 30!  As a Flight Attendant and an author -- I need to look my best on the plane and off the plane! And honey, how is that possible when I am 40 + 13 ...?<br /><br />Well, the only way, is by clinging to Perricone Promise. I am telling every wing sister I know about this book.  It's so practical - for us, and so much safer (and cheaper) than a face lift.  I heartly recommend this book!  Sure there are costs involved with the products he recommends - but hey how much is a face lift?  Or how much do you spend on makeup in a year - trying to hide what the Perricone Promise will repair?  I say, give it a try - what have you got to lose?  And what to gain?<br /><br />Look better, feel better, work better - without surgery and in as little as 28 days!	2005-08-05

He looked like a young John Grisham, working in a job where he interacted with Washington D.C officials. 'But, what I really want to do...' he said, with his head bowed, as if he were suddenly shy 'is write'. I looked at him and thought, 'Who doesn't, you're one of a million'. Two days later, after Michael and his wife returned to their home in the deep south, I picked up his new manuscript and began to read...and was stunned...this guy was gifted! I called my agent and said, 'You have got to sign this guy, this book is a winner.' She did. And that book, A PLACE CALLED WIREGRASS went on to win the Christy Award (like an Emmy ...for writing). Michel and his family remained friends with my family and while I was working on my forth book FLYING BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS: Flight Attendant Adventures on a Wing and a Prayer, he was working on his next novel. Then he called one day and said 'There is this song on the radio you have to listen too...it's called LIVE LIKE YOU WERE DYING and it's my story.' I said, 'That's great Michael, maybe you should call Tim McGraw and tell him that. Ha Ha Ha.' (I was joking because no one we knew...knew how to contact Tim McGraw') A few days later, Michael called and sounded in shock, 'I didn't have to call Tim McGraw,' he said, 'his people contacted me. Marsha, It's like it was meant to be.' LIKE YOU WERE DYING is a true story, not just for the father of Tim McGraw..but for Michael Morris as well...maybe that's why it's ringing in the hearts of so many people. And now, as this his third book sells around the world - and he is writing his forth, I don't think Michael Morris is one OF a million, but, one IN a million.	2005-05-12

Because as Lisa Warren says, \\"If you've written a book, you have a new job...and the name of that job is 'publicist'.\\"  Then she goes on and gives incredibly practical tips on how to go about doing your 'new' job.  And she writes from a position of having been on the inside in publishing, and the outside as an author. I loved this book right from the introduction - where she tells the story of one author - (which happens to be the story of thousands of authors I know).  Filled with great tips.  A great book.

To quote a blurb on the back of the book &quot;It broke my heart in 1,000 places&quot;.  And those of us who have friends and relatives who struggle with being more than 100 lbs overweight, will want to rush out and buy this book for them, because here FINALLY is a book written by a &quot;FAT&quot; (actually former fat) person who describes in detail the pain &quot;FAT&quot; people experience.<br />Betsy is good  at drawing you into her world, and making you feel as if you are observing her struggle (almost as if you were seeing it played out on the big screen.)  The fact that she overcame her stay in the mental institution and the stint with the grossly inept therapist, and then rose to the place she is now, is encouraging to say the least.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who knows anyone who has ever been in O.A.

If that's true, then Max Adams's book, is worth a year of Therapy.  First it reads like a \\"chat with a friend\\"...a friend who has been there, done that, and written about it.

I also think this book is a must read for Novelists who hope to have their movie made, or anyone who can't understand how a screenwriter can get a reported half million deal, and end up broke.
