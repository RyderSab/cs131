Minette Walters introduces the readers to the corpse almost on page one. Kate Sumner is a blonde, blue-eyed attractive young lady found naked on the Dorset coast of southern England. Shortly afterwards her three year old daughter is found all on her own wandering around the town of Poole. Her husband is way up north on business so he surely can't be a suspect - can he?  By the end of the first few chapters we have any number of suspects, all interesting, maybe crazy, maybe drug addicted, maybe outwardly normal, any of whom may just be the one who did it. <br /> <br />In turn Walters almost convinces us and indeed the Detective Inspector, the two Detective Sergeants, the WPC and the local area policeman that each of the suspects did it. The husband is decidedly odd and his absence at the time of the crime doesn't give him a watertight alibi by any means. Nor too the young man, an actor or would-be actor, who owns a boat, poses for raunchy photos, may just be gay, but who certainly had an affair with Kate. Hie best mate, a schoolteacher who lives a in a hovel and is a generally undesirable type could also be in the frame. Then there's Kate's ex-boss who had his way with her too, consensually, late at night in the office. <br /> <br />The characters are painted colourfully; the scenes of the English countryside and coastline are too. It is a clever story and one that keeps you guessing until the final few pages when the truth is revealed. <br />	2005-09-20

We know him so well as Inspector Morse and Kavanagh QC, but how much do we know about the man himself? Thanks to Sheila Hancock's dual biography and autobiography \\"The Two of Us\\" we now know a great deal. Thankfully this book is utterly frank and there can be few secrets of their lives that have been hidden.  I'm not sure I even knew that Sheila Hancock and John Thaw were husband and wife until reading this book. Sheila was born in 1933, a pre-war child, and John 9 years later during the war. John was born into a very poor family and the defining moment, which was to influence the rest of his life, was when his mother walked out on him and his brother when he was just 7 years old.  <br /> <br />Sheila preceded John through the same London drama school (RADA) but it wasn't until about 10 years later that they met when cast together in a play. Sheila was about to lose her first husband to cancer. John and Sheila marry with each bringing a daughter to the union from their earlier marriages. Of course, as is often the way, they produce another daughter to give them a happy trio.  <br /> <br />The story progresses through more than the average couple's share of real life dramas, from alcoholism, depression and cancer to separation.  Sheila's love, inner strength, determination and courage is essentially what gets them through these troubled times to a happy reconciliation and final few years together before John's untimely death in 2002.  <br /> <br />Between and within the biographical chapters are constant references to current affairs, political events, elections, wars, acts of terrorism and other bookmarks in time. Sheila does not hide her left wing opinions but tells little of John's political views.   <br /> <br />The book ends with Sheila living on in desperate sorrow after John's death. She does try to find about more about John's late mother - whose funeral he did not attend - and what might have drivenher to abandon her sons and leave such a mark on her beloved husband.  <br /> <br />Whilst I loved this book I was frustrated by the large number of bit part players, maybe one every couple of pages, who came and went without really adding to the thread.  Occasionally it was assumed that the reader would recall an earlier reference to one of these characters from many chapters earlier. In my case it was just too difficult. All in all this  is a very interesting, open and readable biography of one of TV's most recognizable and well-loved contemporary characters <br />	2005-09-02

With severe injuries including a fractured skull and a broken arm, pools of blood and evidence of intoxication, it doesn't take the coroner long to pronounce \\"Death by Misadventure\\".  It appeared that at the height of a winter storm in torrential rain, whilst staggering in the road, Miss Butts was hit a glancing but fatal blow by a passing car whose driver didn't notice. <br /> <br />Miss Butts had never slotted in socially with any of her neighbours who largely considered her to be a despicable outcast. She was despised for her colour, her drinking, her solitary lifestyle, her housing of stray cats, her poverty and as a person.  <br /> <br />Another resident from further down the street, Mrs. M. Ranelagh, was not happy with the coroner's verdict believing him to have given the case little more than his cursory attention.  Her initial efforts to probe the circumstances surrounding Ann's life style and tragic death make her the focal point of the other neighbours' prejudices and hatred. They are simply delighted to have Ann dead and buried and out of their lives. Apart form anything else imagine the beneficial impact on their property values without an \\"undesirable\\" resident in the street. Finally forced to leave home, Mrs. Ranelagh heads overseas with her husband and children only returning to England some 20 years later, the time in which most of this story is set.  She now takes up the case with a vengeance, probing Miss Butts' medical history, her visiting vicar's records, witness statements at the inquest, actions of the neighbours at the time, actions of the investigating police officers and in fact not leaving a stone unturned.  <br /> <br />This was a difficult story to tell with the victim having been deceased over 20 years and no reader sympathy having been engendered towards her. There is barely any suspense built up in the story and certainly no excitement. As Mrs. Ranelagh probes into the lives of the many neighbours and police the story becomes very complex with too many characters, too many complicit relationships, too many skeletons in various wardrobes and too many side stories. The plot is difficult to follow and perhaps the author recognises this by including a map of the houses (and their owners) in the street and a several photos of those neighbours at various social functions. There is simply not enough of substance to hold the readers' attention. The plot never rose to any heights and unfortunately drifted towards a wishy-washy conclusion. This was a disappointing book from an author who has written several thrillers of the highest quality.	2005-07-31
US	46230447	R2PTESMXP97DOR	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A beautiful tale	This is a beautifully crafted work of recent-contemporary historical fiction by well-known author John Grisham who branches out from his usual legal thrillers in a wonderful diversion to rural America and the cotton fields of Arkansas in 1952.  The Korean War is grinding on as one of the several backdrops to the novel. The story is told through the voice of seven year-old Luke Chandler the son and grandson of two conservative men who have farmed the same land for years. Their lives revolve totally around cotton - its fluctuating price, the floods or draughts which determine the quality and quantity of the crop, the health of the soil, the quality of the seeds, the cost of fertiliser, the skills of the pickers, the cost of labour and so many other factors.  <br /> <br />As the summer sets in, the Chandler family brings onto their farm two diverse groups of people to work the land. There are the hill people, the rough and ready labouring journeymen, and the Mexicans, a cheaper and very hard working version of the same.  <br /> <br />The day they arrive, the hill people upset Luke, a would-be Cardinals baseball player, by setting up camp on his beloved baseball ground next to the family house. They could have camped anywhere, but no, it was slap-bang on the pitch. However, the family does have one redeeming grace and that is the beautiful daughter Tally, a mere 10 years older than Luke who instantly falls in love with her. Her brother Hank is a giant amongst men and capable of doing the work of two in the cotton fields. Amongst the Mexicans is Cowboy, a counterpoint to Hank, another large, sinewy, strong man and one not be taken lightly.  <br /> <br />Luke interacts with all the characters and his narrative weaves them and the whole plot together in an easy and seamless manner. He becomes the sole custodian of a number of secrets as the plot unfolds and also bears lone witness to a hideous crime. Yet, Luke is able to balance the sinister effects on him with his weeklytrips to town on market day, enjoying the carnival atmosphere of side-shows in the back streets, listening to wireless commentary as his Cardinals play their weekly games and of course spending time with his beloved Tally. <br /> <br />Yes, the outside of the house which has been bare timber throughout its long life is slowly taking on a new character as it is gradually painted white by a person or persons unknown. This sub-plot from which the book takes its title is yet another diversion in Luke's young life. I loved the book and its easy style of writing. Even the descriptions of the baseball games were captivating to me as a non-American with but a superficial knowledge of the game. A book to enjoy.  <br />	2005-07-04

All the broken bodies have been meticulously washed spotlessly clean of any obvious forensic evidence such as blood, skin, hair, fibres or the like which could provide a link to the killer. The police force is split between old-fashioned coppers with their traditional crime solving methods and the forward thinking university educated detectives who know that modern tools and techniques are what are required.  The decision to bring in criminal psychologist Tony Hill to come up with a profile of the killer is thus a divisive one. The old-time detective leading the manhunt will not admit that there may be a serial killer on his patch, preferring to let the public think it is merely a wave or unrelated murders. The early conclusion by Tony Hill that it is certainly the work of a serial killer further alienates him from the chief investigator. <br /> <br />Author Val McDermid allows us to read the diary of the psychopath as an introduction to each chapter, keeping up a parallel story in the same time frame. We see how each victim is selected and stalked in the lead up to his capture. We also see how the killer selects the torture instrument of choice and designs, builds and tests it. McDermid cleverly researches these mediaeval instruments.   <br /> <br />Hill's main support from within the crime squad is Detective Inspector Carol Jordan who campaigned successfully for the services of a criminal psychologist. A tenuous relationship gradually builds up between Carol and Tony, which despite their best efforts strays just beyond the professional. This relationship provides an element of relief and romance from the otherwise black storyline.  <br /> <br />The whole story is beautifully written and eachcharacter comes to life with his or her foibles, weaknesses and strengths. The plot is well conceived, well developed and the tension allowed to build to breaking point as the climax is reached. <br />	2005-06-24

A dog out for a walk with its master unearths the bones which are immediately recognised as human. Bosch is soon at the scene to begin what would seem to be an impossible investigation. Providing the feminine interest is good looking Julia Brasher, a rookie policewoman in her late thirties, who has left a career in law and a globe trotting life of travelling in order to really \\"make a difference\\" as a law enforcer.  <br /> <br />The theme of investigating a 30-year homicide is in a way relaxing for the reader as there is no apparent threat of nasty scares from scum with blood on their hands lurking behind every corner. However, the literal and figurative unearthing of old bones does directly result in the three further tragic deaths as the investigation takes its course.  <br /> <br />City of Bones is a very entertaining thriller that regular Connelly readers and new ones alike should all enjoy. <br />	2005-05-10
US	46230447	RYFBGK57TNWDZ	1400031575	342108579	Faceless Killers	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An Intriguing Murder Mystery	An intriguing murder mystery in which the plot is held together by the character Kurt Wallander, Chief Police Inspector, investigating an apparently motiveless double murder. Being apparently motiveless, the reader is not challenged to work out \\"whodunnit\\" as in an Agatha Christie plot but to sit back and enjoy the read as Wallander copes with the many stresses of his private life and the pressures of solving the murder.  Recently divorced and trying to come to terms with this situation, experiencing weird erotic dreams, coping with problems with his 20 something wayward daughter and pursuing romantic ambitions with the state's chief public prosecutor provide just some of the fabric around which the novel is cleverly weaved. A few suspects do crop up as the novel progresses and these are gradually eliminated or further and further investigated with sometimes surprising outcomes.  There's a serving of violence towards the end as the chase for the faceless killers reaches its inevitable climax. This story is an easy read with plenty of lighter moments to contrast with and provide a break from the gruesome murders. Also the backdrop of the relatively quiet and calm country of Sweden is a contrast to the more familiar and frenetic New York or Los Angeles settings. New readers as well as those who are already familiar with the Wallander crime books should enjoy \\"Faceless Killers\\". <br />	2005-01-17

The narrator is Darcy, a UK based Australian journalist with a mission to visit an Ethiopian fighter pilot being held as a prisoner of war held by the Eritreans after being shot down in his Soviet MiG-23 fighter. Darcy travels with a group of unlikely companions including the young French daughter of a film cameraman who is seeking her father, an aid worker whose motives are not evident at the start of the story, the widowed Lady Julia working for the cause of feminism and a number of Eritrean escorts. The journey brings them face-to-face with the worst atrocities of war including landmines, napalm bombs, fragmentation bombs and of course, machine gun fire. Nature throws up its own challenges too with swarms of locusts enveloping everything in their path. Overland travel is under the cover of dark as there is nowhere to hide in daylight. Schools, hospitals and dwellings are in caves and tunnels, leaving only the crops above ground, which provide a ready target for the enemy fire. The traveling group witnesses the lows of field hospitals served by surgeons with barely any anaesthetics and with only the basic tools of trade, to the highs of animated and passionate games of football between different guerilla units.  <br /> <br /> Darcy's love life has been a failure with his Australian born Chinese wife having left him for an Aboriginal escaped convict some years earlier in the Northern Territory. Now a tall elegant lady by the name of Amna in their traveling party arouses the hints of romance in him. He is not confident to voice his feelings openly but does so under the influence of the local brew Sewa to his own embarrassment and to no avail. Amna has beenbadly tortured by the Ethiopians and is unable to reciprocate any such feelings.  <br /> <br />Our party approaches closer and closer to Asmara as the book reaches its climax. We hear of the taking of 18,000 Ethiopian prisoners of war at the battle of Afabet, one of the biggest battles since the Second World War.  We are also told of the rebel strike at the Ethiopian air base at Asmara in which more than 40 MiGs were destroyed along with 3 Antonovs. The huge scale of such a little known war is made evident as we go along with the disparate group of individuals seeking their own private goals in the dangerous journey. It is a fascinating tale teaching us a modern day history lesson. The main criticism of the book is the writing style, which makes for difficult reading. Often sentences need to be re-read to gain comprehension and this interrupts the flow of the story. However, the struggle is well rewarded by the quality of the drama and the intriguing mix of the characters. <br />	2004-10-13

Clearly, there is confusion to be overcome when you are brought up as a good, honest, caring, responsible person and yet you end up on the losing side.  Were your values wrong and were you really a bad person underneath? Fuller, now married with kids and settled in the USA revisits her parents still living in Zambia, the former Northern Rhodesia. The trip back was an attempt to find answers to that conundrum.  <br /> <br />Fuller embarks on an overland journey from Zambia through Zimbabwe, the former Southern Rhodesia, to Mozambique visiting the sites of former guerilla skirmishes and hiding holes where the white resistance fighters camped in the African bush. She is driven by a man known only as \\"K\\" who himself fought on the losing side in the Rhodesias before moving to fight as a mercenary in Mozambiqe only to become a loser again. K is a complex character, a one time murderer and torturer, moody, a blindly faithful born-again Christian and understandably carrying a lot of psychological baggage. He lost his young son to illness and has long since been abandoned by his former wife. He now farms a few hectares of land and ekes out a simple living alongside a river in Zambia near Fuller's parents. Her and K's journey to the old battlefields brings Fuller into contact with other former white mercenaries. Gradually their ongoing nightmares and \\"lives on a knife's edge\\" are revealed through a bizarre series of incidents. It is clear that they are afflicted in the same way as veterans from other conflicts such as Vietnam and the Gulf wars.  <br /> <br />This hardly surprising revelation appears to be the conclusion to the book which meanders rather meaninglessly. The story was disappointing in the sense that it really went nowhere and didn't shed any light on Fuller's original quest to find out about herself and the childhood influences on her personality and character. Sadly, \\"Scribbling the Cat\\" didn't reach the heights of her best selling maiden novel \\"Don't let's go to the Dogs Tonight\\". <br />	2004-10-05

He also has time to leave a series of coded messages behind knowing that their meaning will, or may, be decipherable to both his estranged grand-daughter Sophie (a French policewoman in the Department of Cryptology) and visiting American Harvard professor and symbologist Robert Langdon.<br /><br />Langdon is immediately taken from his hotel to the Louvre by the French Police ostensibly to offer assistance but in reality because he is their prime suspect and now ostensibly under arrest.<br /><br />The plot gathers speed as Sophie and Langdon escape from the police to begin a hunt for further clues. The story unveils mysteries of the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Grail. The tale is told of such historical giants as Boticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Claude Debussy (to name just a few) who have over the centuries been charged with holding the secrets of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ's offspring and the noble lineage of Mary herself. The author explains hidden messages in Da Vinci's paintings of The Mona Lisa and The Last Supper which carry part of the same secret.<br /><br />The pace of the book is always fast and the bizarre riddles and codes are always clever and devious. The suspense of Sophie and Langdon's flight from the law of both France and England as they escape over the Channel is held throughout. And . . . it is not only the law they are running from, it is also the evil murderous long-reaching arm of Opus Dei who will kill instantly without asking questions. The thrill of the chase is ever present, the revelation of historical facts is quite astonishing and the labyrinth of codes and mysteries is spell binding.<br /><br />This book is a classic to be enjoyed by young and old.sent, the revelation of historical facts is quite astonishing and the labyrinth of codes and mysteries is spell binding.  <br />  <br />This book is a classic to be enjoyed by young and old.  <br />	2004-07-26

Perhaps it was a big beat-up to generate media hype. With the content of the book being so sexually explicit that publicity was sure to fire up the interest of the book reading public.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />The book was written anonymously to allow the author complete freedom, honesty and openness in telling her story. It would also save embarrassment and hurt to those real life characters (spouse, lover, mother) so vividly described in the book. However, before the book was published, the identity of the author was ferreted out by a newspaper journalist. The publicity generated helped to push ?The Bride Stripped Bare? to the top of the best seller lists in several countries. Was it all a set up or was the author?s genuine intention to remain anonymous?  Whilst it may have been vitally important to the author and those closest to her, it really doesn?t matter to the reader at all as this is an enthralling yarn.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />The story is written in the first person by a young lady beginning with her honeymoon in Marrakech. It tells of her relationship with her husband Cole and her lover Gabriel who enters her life very soon after her wedding. The book is written in diary like style where thoughts as well as deeds are presented in beautiful flowing English. Her sexuality is clearly an enormous driving force, even destructive at times, and one wonders whether her fantasies could ever have exceeded the actual realities of her amazing sex life. The writing is both graphic and erotic throughout much of the book with not much being left to the imagination.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />Her fluctuating relationships with both her mother and her best friend are weaved into the story as a linking thread and this works well. The final chapters of the tale describe her pregnancy and the child birth in clear and descriptive language that could only have been written by a lady who had gone through the whole child bearing process. It is not only the extreme physical pleasures and discomforts of bearing a child but the mental processes that go hand in hand with the physical that are so well written. <br /><br /> <br /><br />It is a great book and one that is probably best read quickly. Without giving away too much it doesn?t look as if there will be a sequel and that is a pity. 5 Stars. <br /><br />	2004-07-21

In the way that engineers sometimes call a report ffinal with two fs when it really is final, I have to describe this book as ffiction to show that it is &quot;over the top&quot; fiction and too far fetched to be enjoyable.

It continues through to the very end of the twentieth century and the fortunes of modern day Myanmar and democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  The story is entwined with the life and times of Rajkumar, his wife Dolly, their children and grandchildren and various lifelong friends. Aged only eleven when he first sets his eyes on ten year old Dolly, he falls in love and that love forms the main thread of the story. Dolly leaves Mandalay to continue her service with the exiled royal family and is destined for spinsterhood until Rajkumar leaves Burma to track her down exactly two decades later.  <br />The story unfolds against the backdrop of the living political history of Burma, Malaya and India over some 120 years. The challenging issues of colonialism, racialism, independence movements and the two world wars are entwined with the family fortunes. Rajkumar, from a penniless orphan, becomes a giant in the Burmese timber industry winning major supply contracts in the face of competition from established western businesses. Meanwhile the last few years of the royal family's exile is described with such detail that you almost imagine Ghosh was a fly on the wall. <br />He clearly did much research to be able to describe so graphically the Burmese timber industry  - one section describing the death of a working elephant from anthrax was quite an eye opener -  the Malayan rubber plantations, the evolution of the motor car, the devastating impact of the second world war on the innocent population, the Indian Independence army and especially the overland exodus of many thousands of expatriate Indians from Malaya through Siam and Burma to the relative safety ofCalcutta in 1942.<br />I was hardly able to put this book down such was its grip. It is a magnificent historic and romantic tale and is worth at least 6 stars!	2004-06-08

He is racing against others to develop a molecular computer which can be implanted into the blood stream. He is also desperate for financial backing over the next 5 years which will allow the development to continue and is courting the top end of town for the big bucks which are so necessary. <br />Neglecting his romantic relationship in order to spend all his waking hours in the laboratory, his beautiful partner Nicole agrees that it is best if Henry were to move out of their shared apartment. When he takes up a new apartment across town he discovers that his new phone number is, or was, that of a local call girl. This is the start of the mystery and drama which form the core of \\"Chasing the Dime\\". Most guys would simply tell the callers that they had a wrong number, tell them to get lost if they called again and would almost certainly change their phone number if the calls persisted. Not Henry though. Henry pursues the phone calls, finds the call girl's web site, visits the site's internet service provider and soon enters the murky world of the on-line flesh business. <br />Unable to find the girl it is clear that she is a missing person, but this status changes inevitably to that of murder victim and naturally Henry is the prime suspect with a trail of evidence leading back to the girl. Why doesn't Henry do what any normal person would do and tell the police the truth and walk away innocent? The answer has to be that the story would fizz out. Instead it turns into a great thriller with the essential ingredients of suspense, drama, deception and even a snippet of romance.<br />One clever aspect to the book is the frustration all readers would feel with Henry who rather than getting out of the hole he has dug, just digs himself deeper and deeper into it. The storyline demands your attention as there seems to be no way for our hero Henry to overcome the impossible situation he finds himself in. The suspense and build up to the climax of the story are imaginative, well constructed and very well written. As with most of Michael Connolly's novels you will need to be a clever lateral thinking reader to forecast the outcome.	2004-04-15

The diameter of the sun at 1.4 million kilometres wasn't surprising enough for me to rush off and check, but it is pretty awesome. Each second the sun burns 637 million tonnes of hydrogen to create 632 million tonnes of helium while releasing some 386 billion billion megawatts. The sun has been aflame for 5 billion years and is about half way through its own life cycle. <br />\\"Sacred Balance\\" tells us that mankind's technological ability to exhaust the planet of its natural resources at an alarming rate and the associated increase in demand on food, water, trees, the land and the atmosphere threaten to modify the sacred balance to such an extent that our survival is under threat. A frightening picture is painted by conjuring up a time-lapse film taken from space over the last ten thousand years so that each millennium passes in one minute. For the first 7 minutes the movie looks like more like a still photo as nothing changes. Gradually, as time progresses, forests and greenery begin to disappear in parts of Europe, Central America, China and India. 12 seconds from the end, 2 centuries ago, the thinning spreads more intensely until with 6 seconds to go eastern north America is deforested. The action accelerates in the last 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 3 seconds and so on until in the final fractions of a second it looks as if a plague of locusts has descended on the planet. Seen this way the planet's forests are being irrevocably lost in a mere tick of the geological clock. Plotted on a chart this forest devastation leaps almost straight off the page in our own lifetime. <br />Finally a series of \\"good news\\" stories are told which serve to give us hope that even an individual with a will can make a difference. From mangrove planters in Kuwait and Vietnam to the \\"Clean up Australia Day\\" campaign which has grown to become \\"Clean up the World\\" good things are happening. However, a lot of momentum is going to have to shift if the cycle is to be reversed and the sacred balance of our fragile and wonderful planet preserved.	2004-03-12

No longer is he the badge carrying, full time detective Harry Bosch, but Harry Bosch retired and Harry Bosch, private investigator. In his own words \\"Like a reformed smoker whose hand digs inside his shirt pocket for the fix that is no longer there, I constantly found myself reaching in some way for the comfort of my badge. My job in this world, badge or no badge, is to stand for the dead.\\"<br />Harry picks up on an old case from his days in the Los Angeles Police Department when Angella Benton, a production assistant on a movie set, was brutally murdered.  Just a few days later there was an armed hold up and robbery of $2million from the set of the same film which Angella had been working on. In the aftermath of these crimes a former colleague who also worked on the case is left paralysed after being ambushed in a terrorist style attack in a local tavern. It is clear that despite his retirement of now 4 years Harry is uncomfortable that these crimes remain unsolved and will likely remain that way unless someone starts digging again. He is the ideal person. Indeed, he is determined to \\"stand for Angella\\".<br />As Harry starts asking awkward questions he unearths a myriad of rumour, gossip, innuendo and the like. It is not at all clear whether these scraps fit together or even whether they are relevant. It would not be unlike trying to do a jig-saw when you are on the other side of a glass which is steaming up and you don't even know if you have got all of the pieces, but at the same time are sure that some of the pieces are from a different puzzle. Harry's lack of official credentials, and in particular the all-powerful LAPD badge, make his task harder still. Adding to the challenges are the post 9/11 environment and increased police operational powers which combine to place more obstacles and hazards in Bosch's quest for the truth. <br />Michael Connelly introduces a number of characters from earlier Bosch novels into Lost Light which gives regular readers a sense of bonding with Harry. His serious girlfriend Eleanor and two or three former colleagues are the main \\"old friends\\". The romantic relief provided by Eleanor is a welcome diversion from the violence and intrigue which form the main thrust of the storyline. The plot twists and turns and only those who really think \\"out of the square\\" will be able to work out the dramatic and surprising ending.	2004-03-08

He received a BFA from the University of Texas Austin and an M.A. from the University of California Berkeley.<br />The story starts with Bob's childhood days and his very early introduction to motor scooters and automobiles in Texas. Then the hilarity of the book really starts - not with \\"Texas Tales\\" as per the title - but the much more exciting Mexican Tales. Imagine the fun that he and his young buddies had over the border in Juarez where the legal drinking age is \\"sorta sixteen\\" and a quart jug of Bacardi rum was about 99 cents. A sexual experience didn't cost much more. Wow, foreign countries are often so much more fun than your own.<br />Then continuing in this very frank and clearly honest vein, Bob takes us through his days at university and through his career. His work includes giant size sculptures for display as public art. The best known was probably a giant iguana which resided during its heydays on the roof of the Lone Star café in New York. Then there's the pair of cowboy boots all of 40 feet tall installed in the front of a mall in San Antonio, Texas. My favourite was probably the beautiful 70-foot tall saxophone which included the body of a Volkswagen beetle, an old surfboard and several galvanised cattle troughs. \\"Daddy-O\\" tries to make his massive sculptures from scrap materials salvaged from whatever source may be available. The wonderful swarthy Mexican waiter with his sombrero, tray of nachos and a giant chilli was largely recycled from its own ancestor, a clean-cut white guy hamburger waiter. Being an art teacher / professor healso utilises his students to help with the projects. He gets the help and they get the experience. \\"Daddy-O\\" is not your \\"easel and palette\\" artist but one who relies on welding, rigging, cranes, scaffolding, compressors, nuts and bolts, power tools and the like to build his public art. Often the common link is urethane foam, discovered by Bob in his early days at Berkeley and never forgotten. It almost defines his work.<br />Another link is the not infrequent outcries against his work from local councils, communities or the like. Objections are generally made when such people feel that the sculpture lowers the tone of the area or may attract \\"undesirables\\" to the locale. The legal arguments tend to claim that the objects do not comply with the many pieces of legislation applying to signs. The defence is always that they are not signs at all, and indeed bear no relationship to signs. They are demonstrably works of art, designed and erected with love and care, for the public well-being and general benefit of one and all. What judge or court would argue with that? Thus the sculptures remain in place with the blessing of the law and so what if a little bit of good publicity has been generated during the process?<br />Mr. Wade is the recipient of three NEA grants and has been included in Biennials in Paris, France; New Orleans, LA; and, the Whitney Museum of Art, New York, NY. Collections include Chase Manhattan Bank, AT&T, the Menil Collection, Houston and the Austin Museum Of Art. He's also got a bunch of stuff on street corners and the odd roof or two!<br />\\"Daddy-O\\" is a fun guy, a fun loving guy, a generous guy, a humorous author, a very unusual artist and a second cousin of cowboy Roy Rogers. Read the book and if you are in the right place (there are several) go and have a look at some of his work.	2004-01-14

Frequent references to places like Breach Candy in Bombay, and the Maidan and Chowringhee Road in Calcutta brought back vivid memories. So too did certain words and phrases like chowkidars (sort of watchman or servant), peons (messengers), dhobi (manual washerman or lady), chota pegs (small whisky's) and pye-dogs (loose unfettered mongrels, often rabid). <br />The descriptive writing is writing is evocative too and I quote the following passage from early in the book which aroused several senses in me: \\"A white mist hovered over the sprawling Maidan. In the early hours of the morning the dry grass looked lush with dew . . . the sickly sweet smell of the city had not yet taken hold of the day, and, in the cool air, the sounds of barking pye-dogs were still faint. Across the Maidan large black crows cawed and swooped at one another from the tall trees, and in the distance people walked and bicycled their way to work along the footpaths, municipal peons in their khaki shirts and bush shirts, pressed into starched creases that would not last till lunchtime, vendors in dhotis, their baskets of ware balanced perfectly on their heads, arms swinging freely in easy confidence.\\" How brilliant is that?<br />This is not only a fascinating and entertaining autobiography but it is also entwined with the parallel story of Felicity's relationship with her father. The book carries a present day story line of her father lying very ill in hospital in the autumn of his life together with Felicity's own story throughout her life.<br />Felicity was taken to India by her parents as a baby as her father managed a travelling theatre specialising in the works of Shakespeare. The huge population of India together with their recent colonial British heritage meant that there was a potentially large audience the length and breadth of the sub-continent. The lifestyle of the family and acting troupe varied from splendid to meagre according to the cash flow and income generated by the performances. They boarded in splendour with Indian royalty on some occasions and in humble, if not run down lodgings on others. Felicity's first speaking stage performance was at the tender age of 9 and from then on that was to be her life. At age 18 she returned to England, against her father's will, on her own, to forge her own way in the world of theatre and found that England was a foreign country to her altogether. Never before had she owned a coat or worn gloves or stockings but the English climate dictated that she did so then. The cultural change was difficult to get used to as was the formal or strict attitude of the British compared to the more laid back philosophies espoused by the Indians. <br />The story takes us through her whole life from growing up in India and learning first to speak Hindi like a native, being top of the class later in Urdu, her love affairs and marriages, her motherhood, her extraordinarily successful role in TV's \\"The Good Life\\", her work with such dramatic giants as Ismail Merchant and Derek Jacobi through to the time of publishing in 1998. Throughout her life the constant threads are her family and India - two enormous constants. I look forward to, and will really enjoy, the sequel to \\"White Cargo\\" even if it is only half as good as the first.	2003-12-05

The primary plot is about the relationship between late night radio host, Gabriel Noone, and a 13-year-old boy, Pete Lomax. Pete is suffering from AIDS as the innocent victim of serious and prolonged sexual assault propagated by his father and others. Donna Lomax, a lady doctor who Pete first talks to on a child abuse hot line, has adopted him and tries to give him the love and security to which every child is entitled. Pete has committed his sad tale to writing and sends the \\"set of bound galleys\\" (manuscript) to Gabriel Noone in whom he has developed a trust from listening to his nocturnal banter on the radio. They communicate by phone and soon reach a level of intimacy in which Pete refers to Noone as Dad. The trust is almost absolute and it is only when a tiny suspicion is fed to Noone by Jess (see below) that the seeds of doubt form in Noone's mind. Noone and Pete's relationship is based entirely on their phone calls, as the two have never actually met. Noone has frequent phone conversations with Donna too, building up another bond of trust and friendship. The plot develops wonderfully and this fictional part of the book is excellently put together. <br />In parallel with the main story line is the clearly autobiographical thread of Maupin's own life. There is the difficult relationship with his own father, an ageing homophobic man who won't acknowledge or discuss his feelings. There's his young stepmother and, as can often be the case, this is one tricky relationship. Then there is the recently ended long-term relationship with his partner Jess, a younger man who has turned to a more macho type of gayness. Whilst Jess has moved out of their shared home and taken new lovers, the two of them maintain a friendly but not intimate relationship for personal and business reasons.<br />The book has a strong gay theme, which for me was quite an eye-opener, particularly one graphically described pick-up in a long distance truck driver's toilet block and the subsequent consummation. <br />The writing style is descriptive and eloquent and one memorable passage describes the death of Noone's dog, written with exceptional clarity and passion. However, the main theme, revolving around the welfare of Pete, is told with building suspense which makes the book very hard to put down.	2003-11-21

I now find myself obliged to backtrack through the earlier stories, which will be no great hardship. <br />It would have to be a challenge for an author to separate his own life experiences and aspirations from those of his main character. The fact that John and Jack are almost interchangeable names and that Ireland's two best-known rivers are the Shannon and the Liffey is a clear admission by the author of this strong link. Be that as it may, Shannon does develop the character of Liffey cleverly as a regular guy, still reeling from the recent losses of his wife and his job, not to mention the custody of his young adolescent daughter. Jack's skills in tracking down missing children and his war experience on the ground in Vietnam make him possibly an ideal person to help locate the beautiful bright American born, university age, Phuong Minh (Phoenix), the daughter of Vietnamese immigrant Minh Trac. <br />Set in almost America's heartland of Los Angeles, the main action is centred in the Vietnamese equivalent of China town. Here, gangs of youths roam the precincts, terrorise not just the locals but also any \\"visitors\\", and generally rule the roost. Jack Liffey soon finds himself on the wrong end of a gangland beating but has the courage to allow himself to be seduced by the glamorous headstrong Tien Joubert, formerly Phuong's employer. Is it courage or is actually the weakness inherent in almost all males when it comes to resisting feminine charm? <br />Not long after he starts his search for the missing girl, her body is discovered. Jack's job is over, or is it? Can he really call off his hunt at this stage? Of course he can't. It's not about his fee any more but about getting to the truth.<br />Shannon's main story has a couple of inner story lines within the frame of the book that add mystery to the possible reasons for Phuong's disappearance. One is that a number of murders have taken place in the area. A serial killer could have perpetrated these. If so, who could that be? Another thread is the story of a sad, pitiable character, a loner and a strange person indeed, whose life is lived in a state of misery, depression and squalor. Could he be the serial killer, Phuong's killer, both or neither? There is a controversial airport development on the drawing board with the usual disparate community extremes surrounding its future. Then of course there is the world of the immigrant Vietnamese who operate in a very different style and culture from the regular American way of doing things. <br />The tension and thrill of the chase build up, as Jack gets closer to the truth. Inevitably, he once again faces great danger as he closes in on the final acts of this dramatic novel. Amongst the better features of this book is that it doesn't stretch credulity. The violence, characters and story line all ring very true.	2003-11-19

He has a settled personal and business life and things are going along just fine on a day-to-day basis. However, a meeting with former girl friend, Emily, of some 14 years before is to change his life in the blink of an eye. She reveals that Myron is the father of her 13-year-old son and that she has now divorced her husband who was assumed by all, himself included, to be the father. That the ex also happened to be a national basketball hero and was the very person who literally crippled Myron all those years ago in his first professional game adds to the colourful background to the story. The young son has been diagnosed with the fatal disease Fanconi anaemia, a chromosome instability syndrome with progressive bone marrow failure and an increased risk of cancers, for which the only cure is a bone marrow transplant. The national bone marrow register has three potential matches, two of whom are eliminated due to non-compatibility after further screening. The third just cannot be found and appears to have vanished into thin air. <br />Coben has by now, after about the first four chapters, built an excellent platform for what should be an enthralling story as the search for the potential bone marrow donor begins. At this point \\"Darkest Faer\\" has a 5 star Amazon book review rating. Unfortunately the story line becomes increasingly complex and stretches credibility. Serial killers, the FBI, recluse super-rich families and a fictitious murder novel become entwined as Myron uncovers mystery after mystery and comes face to face with thugs, evil doers, and treads on the toes of the authorities. The plot becomes harder to follow with the many tangential issues introduced. What should be a gradual build up of tension becomes a disappointment as the story finally reaches its conclusion. Sorry, but three stars is the best rating for \\"Darkest Fear\\".	2003-10-28

Rita Morrone is certainly a good poker player and brings her acting skills to her day job as a fast thinking and tough trial lawyer in Philadelphia.  <br />However the acting takes a low priority when she becomes defence lawyer to her prospective father-in -law, Fiske Hamilton, who is charged with sexual harassment of his young female private secretary.  Soon after the first charges are laid, the private secretary is found murdered and so opens another chapter more sinister and deadly than what went before. Fiske is the prime suspect but as the tale unfolds other characters enter the frame as possible perpetrators, amongst them her fiancé Paul Hamilton.  When her own father is the subject of a violent attack, the case becomes even more personal for Rita than it was already. There are more suspects, more players, more motives, more unknowns and consequently an even greater web of mystery.<br />As is the case in many of Scottoline's books the heroine, the lady lawyer, rapidly assumes the role of sleuth, leaving her legal role to play second fiddle to the built-in cop, her alter-ego. Rita gets tangled in a web of intrigue, conspiracy and mystery as she tries to establish the truth. Her life is in danger through her own actions as she delves more deeply into the mystery towards the final chapters. There are times when her activities really do stretch the limits of credibility but, in a work of fiction, this goes with the territory.  However, with several characters having possible motives the reader is challenged (in Agatha Christie style) to try and untangle the riddle of whodunit. <br />A great touch in the writing is the frequent use of double dialogue in which Rita first thinks the words she wants to use but then utters the ones most appropriate, often the opposite. Example one: Paul:  \\"Aren't two heads better than one?\\"  Rita (Not when I want to knock yours off.) \\"I don't think so. If I need help we have investigators atthe firm.\\"  Example two:  Journalist: \\"Is the judge guilty Miss Morrone?\\" Rita (Your guess is as good as mine, bucko.) \\"Absolutely not. My client is innocent of any and all charges against him.\\"<br />This is a light and easy read, entertaining and with enough surprises to hold the reader's attention throughout.	2003-10-28

For an accomplished writer and a master mariner this book is a work of art. For first time writer and novice sailor Joanna Hackett this is nothing less than a masterpiece.<br />Over a period of five years Joanna, the reluctant mariner, circumnavigates the world with her husband exploring areas not only on the coast but often someway inland. She gives an open and frank insight into her discoveries. The book is a revelation into what a person can do when challenged. Well outside her comfort zone, Joanne takes on the world and its mighty oceans. This is a humorous, beautifully written, account of her travels. Her husband Lindsay, with a little bit more sailing experience, mainly referred to in the book as the Skipper, is her fellow sailor and adventurer. <br />On a whim, but more likely a lifetime dream, he sells their hardware shop in rural Australia in order to purchase the 40-foot yacht Onawa. With the purchase done and dusted they prepare for their first trial voyage up the eastern seaboard of the continent. The bug bites and they don't turn around but keep heading northwards and westwards through the Indonesian archipelago as they begin what will be a circumnavigation of the globe.<br />Their own boat's name Onawa is unusual but on their journey they meet boats with names including \\"Barbara's Floor\\", \\"Hobo\\", \\"Wandering Star\\", \\"Great Escape\\", \\"Rose Rambler of Devon\\", \\"Prodigal of Penryn\\", \\"Day by Day\\" and \\"Rinse Please\\" to name but a few. The names may conjure up the owner's dreams, professions or even their joint names as in \\"Philmar\\". <br />Apart from the excellent travelogue that this book is, it also defines and describes the dual relationship between (a) Joanna and the Skipper and (b) Joanna and Lindsay. Whilst at sea the Skipper is always the boss but things are not that necessarily way in a marriage. Their apparent lack of stress during the long voyage clearly shows how the two people so closely confined care for and cherish each other. There are humorous moments however as the boundaries are occasionally reached and just sometimes crossed. Moments of stress including a bag-snatching incident whilst travelling overland by bus are not infrequent but these usually strengthen the bond between the couple. <br />The book provides a most educational insight into ocean sailing for anyone considering such an adventure. Skills such as provisioning the boat with just enough food and fuel for a long leg of the journey but not too much are essential. Too much food is just a waste whilst too little will mean rumbling tummies and disharmony. Another essential skill is the safe and robust anchoring of the boat before turning in for one of those rare night's sleep when there will be nobody on watch. Over 5 years there are bound to be some anchoring mishaps - a few of the more scary of these are described with just the right degree of tension. Clearly, the consequences of the boat breaking its mooring and drifting away could be disastrous. Once each potentially serious incident has been averted the sense of humour and relief quickly returns to the story telling.<br />Joanna, as she and Lindsay travel around on land in Asia, the Middle East, along the Mediterranean coast, through the Caribbean and finally the Pacific Islands describes the adventures in a humorous and educational style. They mingle with the local people, investigate the history and culture of their stopover points and immerse themselves in their surroundings. However this story is primarily about life at sea and a great story it is too. <br />All aboard for a journey around the world without leaving your armchair.	2003-10-26

They were working overtime in more ways than one. Yes, they are both adults and past the age of consent but this is a professional relationship between a senior elderly judge and a young lawyer. Is he exploiting her, does he love her, does she love him? So many questions, not just for love struck Grace, but for the reader.<br />Where will the story go from here? Well, by the time Grace has gone home to bed and woken up a few hours later Gregorian has been found dead with a single bullet in his brain. To everyone but Grace this is suicide. To Grace it is clearly murder. She knows that no one can declare one's love, make love and commit suicide within an hour. However Grace is unable to argue her case to anyone as the evidence for murder seems convincing and after all, Armen is \\"happily\\" married to his high profile wife currently fighting for election to political office in the state.<br />Lisa Scottoline's challenge now is to hold the reader's attention for the final ninety percent of the book. Unfortunately she fails sadly and the major plot is pushed into the background by issues such as Grace's mother, Grace's long vanished father, the personal relationship difficulties of her daughter and the introduction of Gregorian's dog Beatrice who Grace adopts as a link to her late lover. There is little of Scottoline's usual story line where the lady lawyer turns cop under the pressure of perceived personal threat from the unknown. No great threat is presented in this story and consequently the reader has little fear for the heroine's well being. Grace's own belief that Armen was murdered does provide the loose thread for the rest of the story which slowly evolves in between miscellaneous family relationship issues. The major interest line was not maintained and the tale drifted along to a not unexpected conclusion with a confusing cast ofseveral highly unbelievable characters introduced along the way.<br />This story was a few notches below Scottoline's best and was a frustrating read after the imaginative and wonderful start to the story.  In summary then: a brilliant beginning with mouth-watering prospects but a poor ending that couldn't match the expectation.	2003-10-02

One story thread is that of our heroine Anna in the present, one of her in the past and the third is the story of her friend Estella in the same \\"present\\" as Anna.  Each chapter is headed with the appropriate time line and this is easily missed (well it was by me) as you begin the book but is an important link and guide for the reader.<br />In her mid to late thirties probably, Anna heads off on holiday one day all on her own without telling anybody: not her daughter Lily, not her best friend Estella, nor her gay boyfriend Paul and Lily's proxy stepfather with whom she shares a house.  She has done this on several occasions in the past and always returned after a few days without causing anyone any anxiety. However, as her absence on this occasion extends longer than usual her friends who are looking after her daughter become gradually more distraught with fear. Paul and Estella recognize that calling in the police would be the most sensible course of action but are reluctant to do so in the knowledge that this will devastate Lily. <br />The story of Anna's past lets us know of her free spirit, her love of freedom, independence, travel and of her lovers and liaisons. It is her past which Paul and Anna know so well that initially makes them feel that while she may be \\"missing\\" she is probably quite safe. However, knowing also her proclivity for men with a dubious background their initial ease with the situation soon evaporates.<br />The story of Anna's present is the one where the fear factor is introduced as she is either kidnapped or the subject of unwanted excess hospitality by an unknown gentleman.  Either way \\"Deprivation of Liberty\\" would be the charge against her host or kidnapper, take your pick, in the western world. <br />This is a very clever story and an excellent thriller which makes you wantto keep reading long after you should put the lights out. The other vital ingredient of a good tale, sex, is also there in generous helpings. This not only adds spice and titillation to the story but puts Anna's life style and her life threatening situation into greater perspective.	2003-09-24

Described by most critics as a legal thriller, \\"Moment of Truth\\" is more accurately a real thriller, even a blood curdling one at times. Our heroine Mary DiNunzio is a young inexperienced lawyer who very soon crosses the line from \\"legal\\" work to detective work, spurred on by her nascent fondness for her new client, senior lawyer Jack Newlin. Jack confesses to the brutal murder of his wife, but to Mary it is immediately apparent that he didn't commit the crime and has stood up to take the rap to save someone else. It is also clear to Mary who that \\"someone else\\" is. If you were putting yourself in line for the death sentence it could only be for someone you dearly love. <br />Mary determines to find the truth and is fortunate in befriending not only a reliable honest city cop who believes that Jack didn't do it, but other professional friends who help her with her sleuthing. As the story develops, it takes several twists and turns, opening up what in the first chapter seems like a simple plot, to one of awesome complexity. More characters enter the novel, more apparent motives, more opportunities and fewer alibis for those who may be suspected. And so the mystery thickens. Towards the final chapters the tension builds and violence and mayhem become the norm. To say any more would be to spoil this fine tale as it twists and moves towards its exciting conclusion.<br />Readers familiar with Lisa Scottoline's earlier books will not be disappointed by this cliff hanging thriller	2003-07-18

Whilst cursed with a spinal deformity and near blindness from soon after birth she was blessed with a healthy brain.  She exploited that major asset as perhaps only someone so physically handicapped could.  <br />The tale is told in simple English and is a basic chronology of her lifetime with a lot of family history. Father Edward, an Irish priest, enters her life at the age of 5 soon after the family moves to Hong Kong where their fishing boat is permanently moored in Aberdeen harbour. Father Edward becomes a \\"guardian angel'' to Mary and dramatically changes the course of her life for the better.  Whilst her eyesight is beyond repair - even her grandmother's traditional Chinese treatment of rubbing incense ash and mud into them didn't work - there is a ray of hope that her hunched back can at least be straightened a little.  <br />Mary wins a place at a Catholic girls school where her hard work studying English pays off with excellent results, even mastering Braille in English and Chinese. She finishes college and finds work sewing soft toys.  Despite the difficulty of commuting as a blind person to her work place (how do you cross Hong Kong's dangerous roads safely and how do you know what route number the approaching bus is displaying?) she is feeling a degree of independence. Now aged 21 Mary is admitted to The Duchess of Kent Children's hospital to undergo spinal surgery, thanks again to Father Edward's influence in these matters.  After  painful surgery and nearly a year in hospital with her spine in halo-pelvic traction, her body held rigid with steel rods pinned into her shoulders and thighs, and even her head held in a metal frame, she emerges withher deformity almost cured. This high point in her life is destined to be short lived as at the age of 27 a viral infection paralyses her from the waist down committing her to a wheelchair for the rest of her life.  It is hard to imagine how challenging every apparently simple task can be when one is so handicapped.  At one stage her wheel chair is rolling down a gentle tarmac slope with her feet being badly gouged as they drag on the ground caught below the footrests. Of course, she had no way to notice.  <br />Her adult life is a triumph of determination and will power over the challenges posed by her handicaps. Mind over matter, she wins the battle with the trip of a life time pilgrimage to Lourdes followed by other exciting and mind opening overseas trips. Mary tells her tale eloquently and simply without attempting to exploit the reader's sympathy for her plight. It is a wonderful story. It is also one that will make any able-bodied person realise how fortunate he or she is.	2003-06-13

This is a very cleverly told tale(s) of a dozen or so main characters, all of them as large as life, set in swinging San Francisco in the nineteen seventies. Anything goes and of course anything does. Much like the play La Ronde what goes around comes around.  The lives of each and every one of the characters are inevitably linked as the novel progresses. Persons so diverse, with no apparent linking thread, turn out to be either intimately acquainted or only apart by one degree of separation. Some of the coincidences are amazing, but then real-life can often be just like that. Life is good, life is fun, there are swinging singles, miscreant couples, gay affairs, straight affairs, platonic ones and even the lady of the manor having a quick fling or two with the grocery boy.  <br />The setting is of parties, flash parties, up market parties and parties which are judged by the fame or name of the special guests. It is keeping up with the Joneses, outdoing your friends, work colleagues and neighbours in the most extravagant fashion where easy-come easy-go or here today gone tomorrow is the driving force. Yet for some of the characters it is as little as pursuing a simple dream, enjoying a happy cigarette or searching for a soul mate. Contrasting with the flash parties are scenes in laundro-mats, steam baths, dance halls (jockey pants competitions), supermarket aisles and inner-city low cost apartments. Halcyon, Manigault, Booter, Beauchamp, DeDe, Oona, Binky, Mona, DOrothea and Madrigal are just a few of the characters whose lives and relationships are as unusual as their names. <br />Most of the book is written as conversation between any two of the players so it is a quick read as the pages flash past. An appendix with an instant guide to all the characters in the book would have been useful as there are so many to remember.  However, a few times when trying to recall who someone is or what they did earlier in the book, a link appears with a new person and the past anecdotes fall into place. <br />For those of us who were around at the time  even if not in San Francisco or the USA  this book vividly illustrates and recalls the life style of the era when the music, the drugs, the fashions and the lifestyle were so unique, so superficial, so exciting and yet, at the same time so real. For those who werent, this is not just a social history of the age but a clever, romantic book, well put together and a darn good read.	2003-06-05

Americans she meets feel sure that she is not American whilst Brits are absolutely certain that she is not British.  Fellow travel writer Bill Bryson had the same experience.  This is an epic travelogue by Kurz who traverses the continent four times in an east west direction, closing the loop along the entire Atlantic coast and half the Pacific coast. <br />Irma is not your average American. As she says \\"America is a road country. To be without wheels is to be lame. The truth is I am a hussy of low appetites who always yearns shamelessly for rough travel, and I grab the chance whenever I can to arrive at my destination exhausted, knowing I've earned my goal the hard way. Greyhound and I were made for each other.\\"  Irma learned to drive late in life, never learned to enjoy it and as her mother so eloquently puts it \\"Irma is anti cars.\\"<br />Thus begins her huge journey, one of epic proportions. The book colourfully describes the passing scenery, geography, topography, climate and people of the country. Lots of history is thrown in along the way, some of it landmark stuff in over 200 years of American settlement, whilst plenty of it is local, irrelevant in the wider scheme of things but overwhelmingly fascinating. We also learn of the human dynamics of Greyhound Bus travel, the unwritten protocol of who sits where, back, front or mid-section, near the toilet, near the exits, far from the driver or wherever: the protocol of avoiding eye contact with oncoming passengers if discretely trying to preserve the free seat alongside yourself. Then there are the passengers with whom Irma strikes up friendly and promising relationships which come to an end all too soon as one new friend after another finishes their relatively brief journey. <br />Many of her fellow passengers she describes as she observes them from across the aisle or across the waiting hall in the bus terminals. It is such a truism that the key conversation topic with the elderly is their state of health, and if the Greyhound environment can be a factor so much the better. \\"Last time I went on the bus\\" one old lady told the other \\"I got spasms. I hadda go lay across those three seats at the back.\\"  \\"My tooth was calcified to the bone\\" came the reply. \\"They hadda drill a hole so the infection could run out.\\"  Then there are the young ones she befriends, girls running away from failed love affairs back to the comfort of their home state, or girls traveling forever onwards into the hopefully awaiting arms of their lovers.  A young model is traveling from Reno to \\"Dez Moynees\\" for her mother's wedding. \\"I hope she'll be very happy\\" says Irma.  \\"She'd better be. It's her fourth time\\" is the response.<br />The story telling style is not dissimilar to that of the previously mentioned Bill Bryson. Her tale links the many places she visits with the people she meets along the way and the anticipation of the sort of establishment in which she will next have a night in bed and not on the bus. Whilst Bryson regularly enjoys a drink or two (or three) in the evenings and happily wanders into bars around the world, Irma is less able to be as adventuresome. However, her hip flask is always at hand and frequently requires refilling as she crosses the continent. <br />\\"The Great American Bus Ride\\" is a lively, entertaining, humourous travel book which everyone with a love of life and a sense of adventure will enjoy.  If you've never been on a Greyhound Bus in your life, this book may not persuade you to do so, but it will certainly be your next closest experience.  <br />Jump on board, grab the appropriate seat, sit back and enjoy the ride.	2003-06-03

The story also includes a raft of criminals and border line crims with endearing names such as Bubba, Fluck, Muskrat, Divinity, Smoke, Beeper, Sick, Dog, Pigeon, Weed and Weed's late brother Twister. Plenty of animals featue in this book too with almost more-human names than some of the actual humans. Try Half Shell, Tree Buster, Niles and Popeye. <br />One of the charms of this book is the easy-to-read and fascinating historical backdrop of the city of Richmond and the state of Virginia. Going back to 1607 we hear about British explorers, local Indians, African slaves, Thomas Jefferson, tobacco and the American Civil War to name just a few.<br />However, this is a crime book and a sad tale of young no-hoper gang members, middle aged \\"simple\\" characters who enjoy nothing more than huntin', fishin' and guns, and middle class citizens of Richmond whose characters are all delightfully painted by Cornwell. Cleverly, the paths of all these characters including our 3 police officers, become crossed in the final few chapters as the story reaches its climax. <br />This book has a delightful comedy style in one way and yet contains its fair share of murder and violence. The plot is well thought out and presented and should provide plenty of entertainment to new and established Cornwell readers, although those expecting to find a Kay Scarpetta type thriller may well be disappointed.	2002-08-30
US	46230447	R13I1NKFQ2MN9F	0393307050	680723399	Master and Commander	Books	3	3	7	N	N	Historical masterpiece, but not for me.	Set in the year 1800 this story tells the tale of the adventures of newly promoted British naval captain Jack Aubrey and his vessel \\"Sophie\\". <br />This book was really hard to read and enjoy. The historical background is not explained in the book so it assumes the reader has a prior knowledge of the politics and state of European history at that time.  The English is difficult to understand with lots of most uncommon words, and other words which may then have been current but are certainly no longer.  The nautical terms are just as technical with a specialist knowledge needed to comprehend their meaning.  The one concession to the reader is a drawing amongst the author's notes showing the 21 sails of a square rigged ship with each one's name. If I had written this book I would have included more reader's aids including a map, maybe a list of key dates of historical events of that period and a list of definitions of some of those rare words. Certainly my regular contemporary dictionary was not of much help in that regard.  The map would have helped as at one stage the Sophie is sailing from Minorca to Alexandria but seems to be on a west by north west heading, surely the wrong way. <br />There are plenty of battles between various ships throughout the book.  There are French, Spanish and Italian warships but it only becomes apparent towards the final chapters who is fighting who. The battle scenes are well described with almost the equivalent of \\"hand to hand\\" fighting as the ships get close enough to shoot their canons and even muskets at each other. The great friendship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is a fine thread running the book which, along with the battles scenes, make the story just that little bit more readable.<br />I acknowledge that author Patrick O'Brian has rightly been acclaimed and awarded for his series of nearly 20 naval novels of the Napoleonic Wars. As one critic wrote \\"His depiction of the detail of life aboard a Nelsonic man-of-war, of weapons, food, conversation and ambience, of the landscape and of the sea is masterly. O'Brian's  portrayal of each of these is faultless and the sense of period throughout is acute\\". This is clearly the case, but the novel is hard work and I felt a great deal of relief when I eventually reached the final page. I also find Shakespeare most difficult to read and therefore seek out other writers for my entertainment. O'Brian falls into the same category so that has to be a fair comment on his literary skills.	2002-08-30

It is a story that keeps you on your toes and guessing from start to finish.  The book is best read quickly as it does introduce a great number of characters, most of whom could be the perpetrator if you really think about it.  Some of the characters only make brief guest appearances before virtually vanishing from the novel then mysteriously reappearing as briefly as before.  This is otherwise an intelligently written, clever, murder-suspense mystery in which Tami Hoag allows the reader to settle back and relax in a false sense of security before another attack shakes you to your boots forcing you to reach for a soothing whisky.  <br />Our heroine, advocate Kate Conlan, battles throughout the story to get her single witness to the first cremation to open up and talk.  Is she, the young witness, trying to hide something?  Is she known to the murderer and under threat herself or is she battling severe psychological problems? It seems that only Kate has any chance of making headway with the reluctant witness but for each step forward she takes, other investigators achieve two back in their own efforts to get inside the mind of the traumatised girl.  Time is of the essence as the murder becomes the first in a chain of serial murders, each body being cremated.  <br />Romantic relief is introduced at an early stage in this novel as a former love of Kate is brought into town to give a high profile public face to the inquiry.  However it is yet another challenge and diversion for Kate who has her hands full with the investigation.  Between the murders and the ever present threat of further murders, the reluctant, unwilling and yet willing former partners are thrust together in a diverting sideline to the main story.  <br />This is a thriller which will keep you guessinguntil the final chapter.  It contains something for everyone: horror, violence, suspense, mystery, intrigue, politics and romance to name a few.	2002-08-02

So begins another fast paced, action packed, mystery thriller by Michael Connolly. Listening to the LAPD scanner, Bosch sits at home alone \\"enjoying\\" a roasted breast of turkey and a glass of red wine while he savours the ceremonial opening of his three Christmas cards.  A cryptic message in cop-speak from the scanner brings Bosch back to reality and, abandoning his Christmas dinner, he heads off to a dingy motel room and a corpse.  Initially it looks like a suicide but certain aspects of the case worry Bosch who is certain it is a homicide.  The victim is a police colleague and all the circumstances of his death and the events leading up to it provide a deeply tangled mystery.  Is there any link with another homicide in town which the dead cop had been investigating? Is there a link with the new \\"Black Ice\\" designer drug being distributed around town and in particular with its source over the border in Mexico? <br />The excitement of the novel builds as Bosch gradually strips away the shrouds of mystery like layers of an onion, but still seemingly getting nowhere.  Romantic interludes with the late cop's widow and the thrill of  his undercover, even illegal, investigations in Mexico bring the drama to a climax.  The reader has to give his/her imagination free rein remembering that this is a work of fiction and that anything goes.  Our hero really is a hero and good must surely triumph over evil.  Relax and enjoy the ride.  This is not Michael Connelly's best novel but it is far from his worst. It sits comfortably in the middle of the pack and most regular Connelly readers will find it an enjoyable and escapist adventure story.	2002-08-01

Professional, award-winning photographer, Mitch Coltrane, is hiding in a pit, three feet wide, seven feet long and three feet deep which smells of loam, mold and urine.  He has already been waiting 36 hours and is prepared to wait longer . His aim is to photograph the evil Bosnian Serb leader Dragan Ilkovic exhuming bodies of innocent victims from a mass grave for removal and disposal elsewhere.  The photographic evidence, should he succeed in getting it without being caught, should enable the International Courts or War Crimes Commission to convict Ilkovic and lock him away for a very long time.  Eventually Coltrane's patience is rewarded as Ilkovic arrives and the horror of the subsequent events leaps out through the pages.<br />The story then takes on a more sedate theme, giving the reader time to relax and enjoy the book as Coltrane begins a fascinating photographic project back in California with the help of his beautiful girlfriend, Jennifer. However, the tension, suspense and horror gradually return, accelerating through the chapters, to another climax and the conclusion of the first \\"half\\" of the book. In this section, the detailed knowledge of author Morrell of cameras and photography is evident and he weaves this technical thread through the story without in any way confusing or boring the reader - in fact the very opposite.<br />As the second \\"half\\" of the story unfolds, our hero Coltrane becomes fascinated with, entranced by, obsessed with and ultimately seduced by the irresistible new heroine Tash.  The unstoppable development of their relationship and the vivid descriptions of the inner and outer beauty of Tash are described in the most convincing way. It is excellent imaginative writing of the highest calibre.  It is not long before terror and fearreturn, becoming an overwhelming backdrop to the saga.  More and more, the second half of the story mirrors the first half in a coincidental but nevertheless believable manner.<br />It is a very clever book in structure, style, content and presentation.  It captures the reader's attention from start to finish and leaves you wanting to read it again for another helping of imagination, romance and fear. Nothing less than true escapism.	2002-04-10
US	46230447	R207Q7ZHJSTRE7	0060193611	112419171	The Map That Changed the World: William Smith and the Birth of Modern Geology	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Geological Textbook or Biography ?	This was a disappointing book and for the first half was more like a geology and paleontology textbook than a biography.  It was difficult reading and required determination to fight through the technical jargon.  It was only at about the mid-point of the book that the politics, intrigue, romance and other essential elements of a good story came into play.  <br />The writing style does not lend itself to easy reading either.  Many sentences are far too long - and even have long sub-sentences in the middle, split by the unusual punctuation of dashes - before the original sentence is again picked up and concluded.  Coincidentally, or maybe not, this writing style appears more frequently in the rather dry first half of the story than in the latter half where the action begins to pick up.<br />There was also a great deal of repetition, almost as if the author, Simon Winchester, was trying to pad out the book.  Perhaps the truth is that the whole story could, and perhaps should, have been told in just a few chapters rather than the whole 300 pages.  In fact the five page prologue to the book presents a concise precis of its entire contents. <br />Winchester did succeed though in gaining the reader's sympathy for the man, William Smith, who produced the map that changed the world.  Set in England 200 years ago, the story of Smith's brilliance in geological pioneering investigation, hands-on field work, identification of fossils and understanding of the importance of their place in the various geological stratas, is fascinating.  As a man of humble origins, his battle against the dilettante, upper class, amateur academics who ignored or vilified him was as big a challenge as his real work.  The map signed by W. Smith and dated August 1st 1815 was finally accepted as the first true and accurate record of &quot;A Delineation of the Strata of England and Wales with part of Scotland&quot;.  He was to be the inaugural winner of the Wollaston Medal, the geological equivalent ofa Nobel prize, in 1831, in the autumn of his life.  <br />The book is well worth the read but be prepared to work hard to get the most out of it.	2002-04-08

A client's son is being observed and photographed as he goes about his day to day life at college.  Unknown to his mother, the son senses that he is being stalked.  A photograph of him arrives anonymously in his mother's mail one day and she brings in Patrick and Angie to investigate. They make initial inquiries with their underworld contacts who also happen to be their prime suspects.  It soon becomes clear that they are not involved.  Time passes, nothing happens and it appears that there is really no threat to the young man and the investigation is suspended.  As the saying goes...\\"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...\\" he is found gruesomely murdered.<br />The trail is cold at first but as new murders occur, a pattern evolves, and a possible link is established to other murders committed over twenty years previously.  Struggling to convince themselves that they are making any real headway with their investigations, Patrick and Angie find themselves targeted by evil forces and their lives are clearly in great danger.  The tension builds as they fight fear of the unknown by the unknown and the very real threat to their wellbeing.  <br />A little bit of relief is provided for the reader with the side stories of Patrick's relationship with his lover, Grace, and Angie's with her ex-husband.  This is a well written, horrific and suspense filled thriller, even though some of the horrors do just stretch the imagination.  The writing style, in which the main characters go off into trains of thought in between actual dialogue, takes some getting used to.  When reading the spoken words of the various shady and criminal characters in the book it helps to imagine them talking in the guttural hoarse style of the Godfather.  If you don't like gruesome murder and violence this book isnot for you.  If however you enjoy a scary, tension filled ride, jump aboard and enjoy the journey.	2001-11-21

As with most \\"Prey\\" books, the story is written in two persons, Lieutenant Lucas Davenport (the cop, the good guy and the main character of the book) and the villain who Davenport is hunting down.  This particular villain, although successful, good looking, wealthy and a qualified medical doctor is one of life's losers.  He is a junkie with a permanent supply of uppers, downers and everything in between which he devours throughout the day and most of the night.<br />The first murder takes place early in the story with Bekker's wife brutally killed at her home by a man in Bekker's pay.  Bekker immediately becomes Davenport's number one suspect through a raft of circumstantial evidence. Even though he was on the other side of the country at the time of the murder his complicity in arranging the murder is quite clear.  The usual chain of murders is set in place and cleverly Bekker organizes them to happen whilst he is under Police surveillance or escapes such surveillance briefly in order to perpetrate the crimes.  Bekker and Davenport, astonishingly, establish a relationship with each other during the course of the murder investigations, popping in for a drink and a chat with each other!  <br />The suspense doesn't build too well in the story as the plot is developed through the persons of both of its main characters.  The story line is weak and not convincing.  In reality the police would have arrested Bekker on suspicion of complicity early on in their investigations in order to prevent him committing more murders.  Whilst this is a work of is fiction, a little credulity would have helped.<br />I'd like to give this book two and a half stars but as this is not an option, it is marginally closer to a three than a two.  I look forward to reading more of Sandford's novels and am optimistic that they will bebetter than &quot;Eyes of Prey&quot;.	2001-11-06

Elias is a lawyer who specialises in suits against the police and all the law enforcement agencies, representing members of the coloured community.  At the time of his murder he is prosecuting the Police Department for allegedly torturing a black man whilst being questioned over the disappearance and murder of a young white girl from a well to do LA family.<br />Conflict of interest prevents the local police from leading the investigation into Elias's murder and so our main character, Detective Harry &quot;Heironymous&quot; Bosch, is introduced and put in charge of the case.  He is given a disparate group of police to assist him, including his immediate assistant, a man who has previously investigated Bosch for unprofessional conduct.  <br />Apart from the 9mm bullets, which were recovered from the corpses at the crime scene, there is very little hard evidence and very few clues.  There are no obvious suspects although the myriad of policemen and policewomen on Eliass casebooks find themselves on Boschs list.  This is clearly going to be a difficult murder to solve with such limited evidence.  Add the inevitable politics of the FBI, LAPD, Police Internal Affairs Division, civil authorities, local government and outright interference with Boschs investigation from all the above and the case becomes harder still.  Then theres the racial card, the deceit and cunning of the media in getting their front-page stories and TV news lead stories.  It is a pressure cooker situation and the city faces meltdown with the threat of civil disobedience on the streets if a white cop isnt charged with murder immediately. Its all about prejudice, hatred, pre-conceived ideas and memories of Rodney King.<br />The book moves at a great pace with the excitement and tension building.  This is one of Connellys best books and is hard to put down.  The plot is extremely clever with twists and turns at quiet points in the story just when you, the reader, think things are getting straightened out.  All crime thriller fans will enjoy this.	2001-08-23

My amazement increased when I read in a newspaper, here in Australia at the weekend, that this book had been on the USA list of top 20 best sellers for longer than any other book.  How could Amazon have neglected such an important book?  At the end of the article, to my enlightenment, it was pointed out that the book was published under a different name in USA, The Professor and The Madman.  That is how I am now able to present my review of this excellent book which was published in Australia and the UK as The Surgeon of Crowthorne.<br />It is a wonderful story describing the 70 year task of compiling the Oxford English Dictionary.  The tale is cleverly and appealingly entwined with the adult life of one Dr. William C. Minor, the title character of the book  whichever version you happen to read!<br />The story begins in Lambeth Marsh, a London suburb, in 1872, when an innocent citizen, George Merrit, is on his way to his night shift at the Red Lion Brewery Company.  He earned 24 shillings a week, every penny of which was needed to sustain his pregnant wife, six small children and himself.  Suddenly, in the darkness, a man shouted at him and began to chase him yelling furiously.  Then Merrit falls, fatally hit in the neck by one of a volley of bullets fired by Dr. W.C. Minor.  Thus begins a life in prison for Dr. Minor, committed to the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum in Crowthorne.<br />Author, Simon Winchester, then takes us back through the early days of Minor from his 19th century birth and childhood in the island state of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, to his days as a battlefield surgeon in the Union Army during the US Civil War.  There seems little doubt that his exposure to the horrors of war contributed to his mental instability.  In his mind he was simply defending himself from an Irish stalker when he shot dead George Merrit in London in 1872.<br />From his prison cell, well fitted out as a study and adorned with many of his personal possessions, this educated foreign academic becomes one of the main researchers and assistants to Dr. James Murray who is compiling the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.  Murray is totally unaware that Minor is incarcerated in prison and only discovers this when visiting him for the first time, many years into their correspondence.  The relationship between these two learned men is so totally focussed on words and the compilation of the dictionary that their personal situations are virtually irrelevant.<br />This is a fascinating story and very well written.  It is an example of truth being stranger than fiction.  After all, how could could anyone make up a story like this?  The background of the American Civil War, expatriate life in 19th century Ceylon and the early days of the 20th century in Britain add colour and depth to the mainline story.  It is history and drama rolled up into the one book.	2001-08-19

OK, these people belonged to a powerful, evil, cult, which required them to forget their pasts and isolate themselves from the real world.  One way to do this was to adopt astrological names.  Even so, when the leader of the cult was formerly a top scientist in the USA and renowned around the world for his advances in scientific research, it was hard to accept the circumstances, which lead him to set up this loony group.  Apparently vanishing from the face of the earth for 15 years, but actually dropping out of society, and living in a home for the insane with his wife's financial aid gave him that opportunity.  He emerges with a new name and a group of devoted followers living in a Fort Knox like building and compound.  But it would appear that not all of his followers are that devoted.  The story opens with his death under mysterious circumstances.  Appearing on the surface to be an everyday suicide after imbibing a bottle of vodka and swallowing a few tablets, there is a strong suspicion that foul play was involved.  <br />Now the story line developed around our hero, Lieutenant Peter Decker, (\\"Loo\\"), provided a firm grounding with reality throughout the long book.  He tries his hardest to cope with days on end at work, without sleep, under the glare of the media and the pressure from his police and political bosses, whilst maintaining a loving marriage.  This struggle, of trying to be normal and sane and responsible for his headstrong adolescent kids was more than realistic.  A mixed marriage to a strictly Jewish widow coming with a ready-made family of teens is reality itself.  <br />So, as the plot develops, the suicide/murder leads into a series of worsening events.  The cult members not only won't co-operate with police investigations, they activelyhamper them.  The murders and violence escalate.  However, for me, it was too fantasy like to be plausible and the tension that was clearly supposed to be developing just didn't happen.  <br />If you enjoy science fiction and fantasy this book is for you, but in my judgement two stars is the best I can offer.	2001-08-09

He is under 24 hour surveillance by his own Police department as he is one of a number of murder suspects.  When another horrific homicide takes place whilst Davenport is under the eyes of the police he is cleared of any association with the crime.  As the best man to head up the investigation he goes from suspect to chief investigator instantly. <br />It is clear that a serial killer is on the loose in the twin cities.  Each victim is left with a &quot;Rule of Prey&quot; note such as &quot;Never kill anyone you know&quot; and &quot;Never have a motive&quot;.  The random killings give no pattern to the police.  The only consistencies are the violently sexual assort on each victim and the fact that each victim is an attractive young lady.<br />The killer's first serious mistake is to allow one of his potential victims to escape alive.  She befriends Davenport who gains a clearer picture of the killer's seemingly insignificant idiosyncrasies as well as physical clues such as his stature and strength.  <br />The friendship develops rapidly as Davenport allows her to use his country holiday home to rest, relax and recuperate from her dance with death.  Meanwhile, the media is in a frenzy as the city becomes paranoid waiting for the killer to strike again.  Davenport is simultaneously in a relationship with a beautiful TV news journalist.  These two women allow Davenport to get inside the head of the killer and, using &quot;leaks&quot; to the media, play him at his own psychological game.  It is cat and mouse stuff all the way as the tension builds and the plot thickens.  The stakes rise as the book develops with any mistake by the killer surely leading to his downfall, whilst any mistake by Davenport will mean yet another victim.<br />This is an example of graphic writing, combined with terror and suspense.  It is not for the faint hearted.  Davenport's hectic love life provides light relief from the main theme of the story but is vital to the plot.  This is another excellent book in John Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series and well worthy of its four stars.	2001-07-30

It is all about love and music...but mainly love. Set predominantly in London but with interludes in Vienna and Venice providing a colourful backdrop to the romance. <br />Michael met Julia in Vienna whilst at music school ten years before. Although the relationship ended with the lovers parting, the fire and flame continued to burn powerfully in Michael's heart.<br />As part of the Maggiore Quartet, violinist Michael is a professional musician who earns additional pocket money by giving private music lessons in his spare time. The various affairs he has are mere shadows of his past love. One day whilst travelling on a London bus he sees Julia on a 94 bus going in the opposite direction. They are face to face only 2 metres apart but she doesn't see him and the buses move on. The embers are rekindled and this is where the story really begins. <br />The ever-present background theme of music, from the appropriate Romantic era, is wonderful. You don't need to know the difference between sharp and flat, major and minor or even arpeggio and vibrato to enjoy the evocative writing of Seth. As the quartet plays Haydn, Brahms, Schubert, Beethoven and Bach, the music can almost be heard coming through the pages. <br />The love in Michael's heart is all consuming. It is so powerful and self-consuming as to be almost destructive, blinding Michael to all logic and reason. What a wonderful story, so well written and captivating. Few readers would not be moved by the strength of the story line. You live in the hope that events will unfold as you yourself would wish.	2001-07-30

Harrison weaves a clever tale around the central character, Peter Scattergood, an assistant District Attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney's office.  As the story begins, Scattergood is on the verge of completing another successful prosecution in a case of sexual assault and murder.  He is about to take on a high profile prosecution following the murder of the nephew of the city's black mayor.  His assignment to this case is the result of self interested political motivation by both his boss, the DA, and the mayor himself.  Scattergood is in a lose-lose situation with his natural support mechanism, the police investigators, being in the pocket of the DA.<br />That Scattergood's wife walks out on him at this very time makes his life almost unbelievably challenging. His own parents seem to have more sympathy for his wife than for him.  He is almost penniless too with heavy financial commitments leaving him with virtually no discretionary disposable income.  Far from bringing any relief into his desperate situation, a casual and very sexual affair, only adds to his unhappiness and causes his guilty conscience to work overtime.  He desperately loves his wife and would do almost anything, legal or illegal, to have her return to him.<br />At the stage where only a few pages of the book remained to be turned, I was concerned that all the loose ends in the tale couldn't be neatly tied up.  Were my concerns real or unfounded? You will have to read the book for yourself and find out.  It is an excellent story and easy to read.  <br />I was surprised to find that this may be the only book which Colin Harrison has written.  I have read reviews of &quot;Afterburn&quot;, &quot;Bodies Electric&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Nocturne&quot; written by Colin Harrison, but it seems that may have been another author with the same name. There was no link or reference to &quot;Break And Enter&quot;. My research is clearly not yet complete.  <br />It is always a pleasure to discover a new author and be able to look forward to the promise of reading all his/her other books.  Colin, if it wasn't you who wrote those three other books please pick up your pen, or fire up your lap top and start on another novel.	2001-07-01

The dancing will continue&quot;  Deng Xiao-ping's pledge in Cantonese to Hong Kong.<br />Paul Theroux's novel takes us to the last days of British rule in Hong Kong, British Crown Colony, as the clock ticks down towards the return of the colony to China in 1996.  Theroux is best known as a brilliant travel writer but this novel set in Hong Kong is excellent, matching the best of his travelogues.  He appears to be intimately acquainted with the history, politics, contemporary social scene and geography of Hong Kong, and not least, the state of mind of its various peoples as &quot;Chinese takeaway&quot; day approaches.  Theroux's biography reveals that he lived in Singapore for 3 years and England for 17 years, but never apparently in Hong Kong.  He has been very clever then in capturing the essence of this major peaceful political event through the eyes of two long term &quot;British&quot; residents.<br />There's &quot;Bunt&quot;, a 43 year old bachelor who runs the textile business &quot;Imperial Stitching&quot; he inherited from his father and there's his dear old widowed mum, Betty Mullard, originally from the London suburb of Balham.  Bunt is molly coddled at home by his mother who makes his breakfast every day, fusses over him, talks about England and enjoys a day at the &quot;Happy Valley&quot; races.  Bunt's daily routine is keeping the business going, visiting his favourite girly bar and staying in touch with friends at his various clubs.  He  is having an illicit affair with one of his  factory workers, Mei-ping, unbeknown to his mother.  Life therefore is pretty repetitious and predictable until one day he receives an &quot;offer&quot; for his business which is where the story takes its turn into suspense, deceipt and heavy handedness.<br />This is a wonderful tale of contemporary politics, clashes of cultures, masters turned servants, sleazy bars, romance, suspense and intrigue set in the exotic east.  If you have never visited Hong Kong you will love this novel.  I you have, you will love it even more.ever visited Hong Kong you will love this novel.  I you have, you will love it even more.	2001-06-21

There were too many side line stories that seemed to go nowhere, as if they were there merely for padding.  The main sub-plots should have concentrated on our heroine Mary's Italian immigrant parents, her male secretary, her late husband and her two or three main colleagues, associate lawyers at &quot;Stalling &amp; Webb&quot; in Philadelphia.  Her relationship with those key characters was well portrayed and formed a sound basis for weaving the body of the thriller around.  However, the distractions of introducing so many other characters for just a page or two only seemed necessary to provide a bigger field of potential &quot;whodunit&quot; culprits.  No, I didn't guess who did it!  <br />The legal knowledge of author Scottoline was evident as the story unfolded and this, combined with her easy writing style, made for an enjoyable story with a surprising conclusion.	2001-06-19

Some of the sentences are over half a page long so that by the time you reach the end, the beginning has faded into the distant past.  The absence of inverted commas to denote the spoken word was hard to get used to, often requiring a revisit to check if the passage just read was conversation or narrative.  The final obstacle for me, even though it helped to conjure up the surroundings, was the frequent use of  Spanish.  <br />Now for the positives.  The story has a good plot with two charismatic leading characters who head off into a foreign land in search of freedom, but who discover adventure, romance, violence, hardship and tragedy along the way.  The descriptions of the mountains, plains, storms and rivers of Mexico are excellent, so the atmosphere of that land is always floating there alongside the developing story.   The love scenes and the prison scenes provide contrasting moments of relaxation and tension for the reader.  Reading is a wonderful way to discover new words and even though it is purely imaginative, the word &quot;blivet&quot; on page 46 of the paperback edition, is now part of my vocabulary, albeit changed to suit the person with whom I am talking.<br />&quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; has only recently been released as a movie and I would expect this to be one of those very rare exceptions where the movie is better than the book.  I look forward to finding out.	2001-06-19

I loved this book, the first of the John Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series I have read.  The main character, although you wouldn't know it from reading the cover notes, is Carmel Loan.  <br />&quot;Carmel was long. sleek, and expensive, like a new Jaguar.  She had a small head, with a tidy nose, thin pale lips, a square chin and small pointed tongue,  She was a Swede way back, and blonde - one of the whippet Swedes with small breasts, narrow hips, and a long waist in between.  Carmel was one of the top two or three defense attorneys in Minneapolis.  Most years she made comfortably more than a million dollars.&quot;  <br />Carmel is one cool lady.  She loves life, the good life that is, loves men, loves cars and loves winning her cases in court which she usually does.  She is very smart and cunning, works hard, works late and is very very good at her job.  When she wants something, or someone, she'll get it and woe betide anyone who stands in her way.  Sandford writes cleverly, painting a warm and comfortable picture about his leading lady.  You can't help but sympathise with this heroine who is soon seen to be a single minded, evil piece of work.  <br />The other main character in the book, Clara, is almost as evil as Carmel, but some might say with justifiable cause.  Gee, you would really like them both to get away with it (read the book to find out what &quot;it&quot; is).  There is every chance that they will, with their cunning.  Their crimes are cleverly executed with fastidious detail being made to leave no trace at all of their brief presence at the crime scene.  If they can establish their apparent presence at another place at the same time that's even better.  <br />In between the violence there are passages of fairly gratuituous sexual encounters.  It is clever writing and gives the story a balance of light heartedness and relief.<br />Lucas Davenport, Deputy Chief of Police, has the job of solving a series of murders but with very little evidence apartfrom the bodies, until one day a witness appears.  Davenport gleans just the tiniest bit of a lead from the witness, and then the chase is on.  The story unfolds with Davenport not knowing if he is even on a trail and the two ladies not sure if anyone is after them or, if so, how close they might be.  This is a thrilling story with the characters of Carmel and Clare especially well developed.<br />The tension builds as the chapters unwind and this book will demand your attention right through to the climactic finale.	2001-05-22

It was certainly the hardest to put down of the three I have read so far. Our heroine in this novel is a \\"baddie\\", one Ms. Cassidy Black, who surreptitiously steals a far greater swag than was intended in a daring cat burglar raid on a sleeping gambler in his apparently secure hotel room.  With 2.5 million dollars in her custody and some dubious developers enraged by its loss, there are some very powerful and evil forces at work trying to recover the money and eliminate Cassie.<br />There are no \\"goodies\\" in this book, only \\"baddies\\", so the reader is behind Cassie all the way.  Believe me, she is a lot less bad than all the rest.  Just like \\"Trunk Music\\" the action takes place in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  The story line is set early in the novel and from that point there is no shortage of violence, suspense and surprises.  The descriptions of advanced security systems used in the casinos to watch the gamblers and record just about every public space from corridors to elevators and car parks have been very well researched and written. <br />This book is a standalone book, at least until a sequel is written, so there are no earlier stories to read first.  I mentioned this in my review of \\"Trunk Music\\" which had a couple of back references.  If you want to see the sequence of all Connelly's books, find out a lot more about the author and see actual photographs from many of the scenes in his books you need to visit the author's web site at [...]<br />I'm giving this five stars for its excitement and for keeping me glued to the story until my eyes were drooping.	2001-04-30

Ex-FBI investigator, Terry McCaleb, is recovering from a heart transplant operation and expecting a few months of relaxed and quiet recuperation.  By the end of Chapter One, McCaleb has not only found out that his new heart came from the victim of a violent murder but has also agreed to help track down the murderer.  That he is doing this for the victim's sister who just happens to be drop dead gorgeous sets the plot.  <br />At first it seems that a serial killer is responsible, but not all is as it seems.  When you are an ex-cop, investigations are always that much more difficult.  When other real cops (LAPD) have failed to solve the crime, they have their own agendas, and helping McCaleb is just not on the list.  The story settles down two or three times, seducing the reader into going with the flow, and then another amazing twist occurs which leaves you wondering if you can possibly guess who did it.<br />This is an imaginative, well-written, suspense filled novel with just the right amount of romance to lighten the sinister theme.  Like all of Connelly's novels I have so far read, it will keep you enthralled until the last chapter.	2001-04-24

From the author of two best selling novels &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; and &quot;An Equal Music&quot; this travel book is something very different.  It is a delightfully written story created from the journals kept by Vikram Seth during his hitch-hiking traverse of China from Nanjing to Tibet.  For most people, certainly for most westerners, this is about as far off the beaten track as it is possible to get.<br />We sympathise with Seth as he endeavours to obtain the myriad of visas necessary to cross communist China. These include, entry visas, travel visas, permits to stay in a certain village/area/precinct/canton and of course, exit visas.  The bureaucracy is simply immense and yet nobody has any real authority, always having to revert up the seemingly endless chain of superiors.  Overcoming the man made hurdles is only part of the story as rain, floods, swamps, swollen rivers, altitude sickness, extreme cold, washed away bridges and difficult terrain pose further obstacles along the journey.  <br />During the narrative, Seth breaks off occasionally to discuss the Chinese political system and interestingly compares it with the Indian political system.  The Chinese dictatorship virtually removes free will from the people whilst the wheels of Indian democracy slowly turn in a very different form of bureaucratic inefficiency.  &quot;One overwhelming fact&quot; says Seth &quot;is that the Chinese have a better system of social care and distribution than we in India do.  Their aged do not starve.  Their children are basically healthy.  By and large the people are well clothed, very occasionally in rags.&quot;  He goes on &quot;The fact that we have elections every five years means that the government is afraid to undertake projects that are unpopular but beneficious in the long term.  The Chinese government is not thus fettered&quot;.<br />Throughout his travels, but particularly in Tibet, the smashed temples, buildings and works of art, to say nothing of the ruined families, present evidence of the destruction which was wrought during the cultural revolution.  How ironic that I was reading this in April 2001 whilst the Taliban were destroying fifth century carvings of standing Buddhas in Afghanistan.<br />This review would not be complete without a mention of the yaks which form part of the scenery along Seth's route.  Whilst alive, the yak is an efficient machine converting grass into milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt.  It provides a convenient means of transportation and delivers dung for fuel and fertiliser.  Finally, the meat, bone, pelt, fur, hooves and tail provide sustenance, clothing, leather and material for tents and awnings.<br />So, please read and enjoy this unique travelogue by an educated, eloquent and observant man, multilingual Vikram Seth, also known as Xie Binlang in China.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-04-16

John Le Carre paints a colourful picture of a number of eccentric British expatriates in Panama whose lives become entwined with each others and those of their local friends, against the political backdrop of the imminent hand over of the Panama Canal by the USA to Panama.<br />We have Harry Pendel, owner of Pendel and Braithwaite Co. Limitada, Tailors to Royalty, formerly of Savile Row, London and presently of Via Espana, Panama City.  And then there's Andrew Osnard, from the British Embassy, Old Etonian, womaniser and a spy.  <br />Harry of course is no upper class Brit, rather &quot;906017, Pendel, convict and ex-juvenile, delinquent, six years for arson, two and a half served.  Taught himself tailoring in the slammer.&quot;  Self-taught he may have been but as tailor to General Noriega his credibility in Panama is well established and even his devoted wife knows no better.<br />Osnard is a different person altogether, painted as an unattractive man and a bully with a superiority complex.  He leans on Pendel with both carrot and stick for inside information on the mood of the people as the ownership of the canal is about to be transferred.  The inner con man in Pendel cannot admit that he doesn't know any more than Osnard himself and so he fabricates tales which he thinks will please Osnard.  He thus becomes the archetypal intelligence fabricator whilst earning a few bonuses on the side.<br />This is an excellent spy thriller which combines mystery, intrigue, romance, misplaced loyalties, jealousy, revolution and murder.  If you know nothing about Panama, the educational value of this book alone makes it well worth reading.  \\"The Tailor of Panama\\" gives an easy-to-read insight into the country, its people, its history, its two neighbouring oceans and its engineering marvel, the canal.	2001-03-23

The true story is set in the last half of the nineteenth century and spans the lifetime of Irishman Patrick &quot;Patsy&quot; Durack.  Patsy arrived in Australia as an 18 year old with his poor immigrant parents, five sisters  and two brothers in 1853.  The strictly catholic family was looking to escape the &quot;troubles&quot; in Ireland, the poverty, the famine, the hardship, the bigotry and the lack of opportunity.  This young man would found a pioneering dynasty establishing enormous cattle stations from New South Wales, through Queensland and into Western Australia. <br />If he thought life in Ireland was hard he was yet to encounter the extremes of flood and drought, the one following the other as night follows day.  There was the isolation of the bush, malaria, beri-beri, dysentery, the sun and the heat to overcome.  Poison bush, cattle tick, and crocodiles were a real threat to the livestock, while white ants ate away at the timber homesteads, and man-made hurdles such as the depression, land rents, industrial strikes and petty jealousies added to the challenges.  Possibly the most difficult challenge was that from the &quot;blacks&quot; as they are called throughout this book, drawn from the diaries of Patsy's father, Patsy himself and his own son.  From his immediate family he lost a brother who was shot and a cousin who was speared by Aboriginals.  The cattle too were frequent victims of spearing.  Yet some Aboriginals were almost part of the family as they were cared for by the Duracks, leaning English with an Irish brogue and having given names such as Pumpkin, Kangaroo and Melon Head.  On the last day of his life Patsy declares Pumpkin to have been the best fiend he ever had. <br />It is difficult to conceive how anyone could even contemplate, let alone achieve covering thousands of miles overland, settling the land, building homes, bringing up families, establishing stock routes and then driving thousands of head of cattle to markets a third of a continent away.  At the height of his success, and defending his ownership of enormous land tracts, some bigger than small European countries, Patsy responds to a newspaper critic &quot;Cattle Kings you call us,  If so, then we are Kings in Grass Castles that may be blown away upon a puff of wind&quot;.   How prophetic.  <br />This book was written by Patsy's granddaughter Mary, and first published in 1959. Apart from drawing heavily on 19th century diaries, her style of writing is very old fashioned and takes some getting used to as the chapters pass by.  It is not very easy reading but the rewards for perseverance are great.  The details have been carefully researched  and the story unwinds with perhaps too many characters coming into the story for but a page or two, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared.  That's not much of a complaint about such a historical saga which should be compulsory reading not only for all Australian school children but also all new immigrants to this young and dynamic country.	2001-03-12

Having attended a literary breakfast in Perth two years ago at which author Bill Bryson was the special guest I could hear his voice with its suggestive intonations coming from the pages as I read.  I laughed out loud at least once per chapter drawing attention to myself on the bus or the aeroplane or at home.  This was particularly so as I came across the many politically incorrect paragraphs which dotted the story.  <br />His fear of natural enemies in Australia was exaggerated to hilarious proportions.  Forget the obvious White Pointer sharks and saltwater crocodiles, what about the snotty jellyfish, the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, stonefish, stingray, redback spider, tree snake, Cassowary bird, giant worm and many other deadly creatures which can all kill, but only slowly after the victim endures hours of paralysis, pain, swollen eyeballs, angina, spasms, involuntary discharges and other manifestations of a gruesome end.<br />A comprehensive potted history of this young - since being colonised by the white man - country is told in succinct detail throughout the book.  Bill Bryson has done the research of the last 212 years and presents it all to the reader amongst tales of his travels around the island continent.  No need to slog through heavy history books after reading this tale.  We learn how the various states joined to become a nation.  Also, how the nation's capital city, Canberra, came to be and how it was planned by an American architect.  It was a Danish architect who designed one of the world's most recognisable landmarks, the Sydney Opera House.  We hear how the continent was settled by criminals deported from UK and their captors.  The mindless genocide of thousands of aboriginals was accepted by the majority of the new settlers and almost condoned by some of the judges of the crown.  This shameful part of an otherwise wonderful nation has until very  recently been swept underthe carpet.  Read the background to how the Queen of England's Governor General sacked the Australian Prime Minister in 1975 to the shock horror of the people who, in a referendum 25 years later, voted to retain the Queen as head of state in preference to an actual citizen of Australia.<br />Readers of Bryson will be familiar with his descriptions of museums, hotels, bars, dining rooms and the simple folk he invariably comes across in his travels.  This book on Australia is no exception and there are as many \\"strange\\" folk downunder as in the UK, USA and continental Europe which he has previously described so graphically.  The candidness with which he describes his inadvertent but not infrequent lapses into a state of intoxication is so realistic.  He conjures up the words to describe it most eloquently.  <br />So, please have a thoroughly good read about Australia, meet some of its unique people, animals, birds, fish, politicians, harbours, rivers, mountains, forests and deserts and finally close the book feeling better humoured and better educated.  This is an excellent story.	2001-02-09

This is a gripping drama set in the unforgiving seas off Newfoundland in the North Atlantic.  Adventurous men, and the occasional woman, sign on for voyages of several weeks or more crewing on small (in this case 72ft) commercial boats, long line fishing for swordfish.  The work is demanding, the hours long,  the conditions  dangerous and home comforts just a memory.  Personal conflicts on board often add to the hardships of a voyage.  Financial reward, when the catch is bountiful, is the compensation and the driving force for these fisherfolk.  However, a poor catch provides only average reward so tensions on board are divisive as the questions are debated.  Is there enough food for us to keep going just a few days longer? Is there enough fuel?  Is there enough ice on board?  Is all the ship's vital equipment going to keep working? Are those huge schools of swordfish just over the horizon?  Will the weather pose a threat?  The latter question provides the drama in the second half of the book.  <br />As one who has worked at sea, but in far more comfortable conditions, the descriptions of how weather conditions form, what drives them, what makes them build up and what makes different systems interreact was very educational.  By the time the story reaches its climax the reader has been thoroughly educated not only in meteorological matters but in maritime safety, and the art, skills and dangers of swordfishing.  <br />All this is sensitively entwined with the lives and feelings of real people who put to sea in in the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; from Gloucester, Massachusetts in October 1991 as well as their loved ones back at home.  I enjoyed and was enthralled with every chapter of this book and can only award it the maximum 5 stars.  This will become a maritime classic.	2001-02-04

This is a cleverly written biography of the great master, Ludwig van Beethoven, paralleled in alternating chapters with the history of a lock of Beethoven's hair from the time it was cut from his head in Vienna in 1827 until its laboratory analysis in USA in 2000.  Wisely, the current owners of that lock of hair allowed only a few of the 582 strands to be sacrificed for testing, in the hope that in years to come science will advance to the stage where even more meaningful tests can be carried out.  <br />The life and times of Beethoven in Vienna are described in the context of the life and times of the first owner of that lock of \\"Beethoven's Hair\\", Ferdinand Hiller, a student of Beethoven's friend Johann Hummel.  The greats of the musical and literary world who enjoyed each other's company in Paris as well as Vienna not long after Beethoven's death included, Frederic Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn,  Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz, George Sand and Honore de Balzac, a veritable Who's Who of the romantic era.  The fluctuating relationships between Hiller and some of the above characters from that of close friends to mistrusted acquaintances provide fascinating reading.  <br />Meanwhile, that lock of hair and its various identified owners are traced through the 19th century and through the first one-third of the 20th century until the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Europe breaks the trail.  The amount of research that was necessary by author Russell Martin to describe the prevailing circumstances of the war in Northern Europe at that time, particularly Denmark, can be seen in the many acknowledgements he makes.<br />The writing style throughout the book made for difficult reading with many sentences being a quarter of a page long if not more.  They often had to be re-read so that the first part of the sentence could be understood in the context of the final stages of the same sentence.  Another criticism of the style was the use of dashes - just to break the sentence up - rather than using commas.  However, these criticisms should not put you off a very good read which combines the elements of music, history, war, persecution, love (or the search for it), science and mystery.  It has whetted my appetite to find out more about Beethoven.  I envisage a sequel to this book as more advanced tests are done on those famous strands of hair in years to come and perhaps a movie to rival \\"Immortal Beloved\\".	2001-02-01
