They were built at the height of the Dreadnought era, which also was the dramatic rise of aircraft carrier dominance, eclipsing the mighty battleship as ruler of the seas. So little was known about these leviathans, that the US Naval Intelligence was not aware of their existence until they were spotted in battle in the Pacific War. Details were not available until after the war, but so little visual information was available that we are still learning new data to this day. This book is filled with the majority of the only existing photographs, composed of 64 pages, containing 70 black &amp; white and one colorized photograph, 8 sets of technical Illustrations and the front cover painting by the famous naval artist Tam Freeman. Extensive captions and a brief history of these ships rounds out the coverage on these little known battleships.	2004-02-23

Short of food and supplies, hampered by thousands of refugees fleeing the vengeful Russians, harassed night and day by the Cossack cavalry, the greatest army ever assembled be gins to disintegrate.<br />Alain is sent by his colonel to locate the hard-pressed rear guard under Marshal Ney Protecting some refugees from marauding Cossacks, his horse is shot from under him and he finds himself stranded, his leg injured by the fall, miles behind the French column with no way of catching up with the rapidly retreating regiments.

Owain Glyn Dwr led a revolt in the early fifteenth century. Henry Tudor was of Welsh descent and landed at Milford Haven in 1485. These are the most familiar facts about the history of medieval Wales, and today this history is often presented as nothing more than a romantic story of princes and castles. But there is a great deal more to it. Like every other nation, Wales has a history and identity of its own, and Edward I did not bring that history to an end. Unlike England it was not conquered by the Normans. In the thirteenth century the native princes of Gwynedd tried to create a single Welsh principality, and for a short time came close to success. The fourteenth century was as much a period of crisis for Wales as for every other part of Europe and the effect of the Black Death lasted a long time. The fifteenth century saw the leaders of the community move on to a wider political stage.<br />Why did conquest come in 1282? Who was Owain Glyn Dwr and why did he rebel? Why was Henry Tudor's bid for power based in Wales and what gave him credibility there? Dr Carr considers these questions and suggests some possible answers as he examines one of the less familiar areas of British history.	2001-10-11

Gordon & His North Carolina Cavalry (Army of Northern Virginia series)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Excellent CW cavalry study	&quot;North Carolina has done nobly in this army.&quot;   What did Major General J.E.B. Stuart, the famed Confederate cavalry commander, mean when he wrote these words? Did he refer to the Tarheel infantrymen in the Army of Northern Virginia? Or the gunners in North Carolina artillery batteries? In Stuart's Tarheels: James R Gordon and His North Carolina Cavalry, author Chris J. Hartley shows how Stuart first found evidence for this statement in his own ranks-beginning with one man.<br />Brigadier General James Byron Gordon was a protege and kindred spirit of Stuart himself Often overlooked or confused with cousin General John B. Gordon in Civil War literature, Gordon was the consummate nineteenth century landowner, politician, and businessman. When Civil War came, the citizen became a soldier. After he helped form an infantry company, Gordon joined the Tarheel cavalry. He rose to lead two regiments, two brigades, and (temporarily) a division, before he finally settled into permanent command of the North Carolina Cavalry Brigade. When he died just a week after Stuart, he was one of the greatest cavalrymen ever produced by the state of North Carolina.<br />In Gordon's men Stuart found more to admire. Through them Stuart's Tarheels takes a fresh look at the vaunted cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia-its battles, its controversies, and the lives of its troopers-from the previously unexplored<BR>438 pages, illus, maps, notes, bibliog, appendices, index.	2001-09-28

A brilliant intellectual, his strategy and generalship had prevailed against the apparently mighty military power of Napoleon III of France. Napoleon had thought to bolster popular support for his rule by extending his territory to the Rhine. Instead he lost his throne and France was humiliatingly forced to cede Alsace and Lorraine.<br />By the time this war broke out, von Moltke had  already achieved outstanding and surprising successes against Austria in the Six Weeks' War in 1866, and, a perfectionist in organisation, was the creator of the General Staff system of today. Rapidity of attack by the use of railway transport was as successful in France as in his earlier victories, but in France defeat  of the army was followed by a people's war before final victory was achieved, exemplified most vividly by the long and horrific siege of Paris.<br />Against military autobiography in principle, von Moltke was nevertheless prevailed upon to write the history of this war, thus achieving  for the reader the best of both worlds - a careful and accurate description of events, combined with insights into strategy which as commander only he could authoritatively give. From the preparations for war and the combat of Weissenburg on 4th August 1870, von Moltke sweeps the reader through his carefully planned campaign including every stage of the war up to the armistice and the homeward march of the victorious German army.  Von Moltke is considered by many the most able mind in military matters since Napoleon, and in this unimpeachable work has left for posterity the rare legacy of a complete war recorded from the viewpoint of its commander-in-chief.	2001-09-21

In the first substantial study to be published since the Russians' departure, US military commentator David Isby provides the detail and analysis required to enable informed evaluation.<br />The war offered diverse experiences for all combatants. The Soviet Union became embroiled in anti-guerrilla action against a nation it knew to be of independent trait, when it had primarily trained its forces for major warfare in Europe. The Afghans found themselves fighting a hugely superior force that had total control of the air; the wholly irregular units of the Mujahadeen relied initially on primitive weapons and moral support from distant external friends rather than their own government.<br />The author has spent much time with the guerrillas observing Soviet action against them and their response to it. His assessment of the conflict brings the war into a sharper, more balanced focus for todays reader who wants to understand the course of the war; the reasons for the successes and failures: the wide differences between the logistic support received by the opposing forces: and the general circumstances in which the battle was waged.<br />if the Soviets failed to learn from history that their venture into Afghanistan would be fraught with problems and certain to be met by determined opposition, then studies such as this thought-provoking volume will enable a wide readership - both military and civilian - to use the value of hindsight and skilled commentary to avoid the same mistake.<br />In his chronological treatment, David Isby used many first-hand accounts and illustrates his pages with over 100 illustrations, many of which are published here for the first time.	2001-09-21

Original and conceptual, the author Major General Jagjit Singh, a renowned General from the Gunners, outlines the role of artillery as a vital instrument of victory in war. In a remarkable portrayal of the power of the gun in past battles, he brings out that it was the army with a stronger artillery which won the day.<br />The book traces the historical background to the Indo-Pak War of 1971, the military crackdown by Pakistan on its Eastern province, the escape of 10 million Bengali refugees into India and the eventual involvement of India in a third bloody round with Pakistan.<br />In a style simple and lucid, combined with the professional touch of a front-line soldier, the General describes the battles fought on the Western Front, with an incisive evaluation in the case of major battles. Depicting these in graphic detail, he gives an account of the role played by Indian gunners, the Honour Titles bestowed on artillery units for their outstanding contribution and the courage displayed by individual officers and men in almost every single action.<br />The book concludes with a few thought provoking views on India's defence preparedness - stressing on self-reliance in military hardware, greater interface between the politician and the military, full activation of the concept of a National Security Council, and the need to appoint the Chief of Defence Staff, while highlighting, in particular, the vital requirement to strengthen the artillery punch of the Indian Army.<br />A valuable contribution to India's military history and national security.	2001-09-21

In this book, one of the world's most experienced counterterrorists shows exactly how we can put a stop to terrorism once and for all.<br />The chapter on skyjacking should be read as a reminder before the reader takes any trip by plane. Mr. Rivers shows why security measures such as metal detectors, X-ray machines, frisking, and sky marshals don't stop terrorists. He gives the reader ten precautions to take at the airport before he or she boards and nine additional lifesaving recommendations to follow if he is ever on a hijacked aircraft. That chapter also shows how the hijacking of TWA's Flight 847 out of Athens, which caused the death of American Robert Stethem and a seventeen-day media event that benefitted the terrorists, could have been stopped cold in its tracks during the first hours. Counterterrorist rapid response teams were already in Europe and ready to go. For the first time in print, the author shows exactly how such a counterterrorist team would do the job.<br />The author reveals <BR>Americans are aiding the terrorist killers and who those Americans are, why appeasement of terrorists and retaliation against them doesn't work, and what does work. He details the new weapons of terror already in use that go far beyond machine guns and hand grenades. He tells where atomic devices are now being peddled and which groups in America are eager to get their hands on them. He also shows how the terrorists can cause radioactive explosions by the use of materials already in their hands.<br />Mr. Rivers shows how embassies and business installations can be protected against car bombings, how Canada got tough with its terrorists and found that it worked, and what can be done now to deal with the terrorist training camps within Libya, Syria, and Iran by knowledgeable professionals without endangering innocent civiliansor causing confrontations that could lead to war.<br />Mr. Rivers, who has killed terrorist leaders on covert assignments by Allied governments such as Spain and Britain, throughout this book names names, identifies the killer groups, tells who their leaders really are, and how to prevent further terrorist acts by the same and other groups with means that are currently available.

Vancouver,     <BR>Exploited by weak, profligate rulers, Egypt in 1882 was near bankruptcy -a prospect which alarmed those in Europe who held her bonds. Britain, a major shareholder in the Suez Canal, assumed the leading role. Attacks on foreigners by Egyptian nationals contributed to the increasing clamour from the British press and public that their government take action because &quot;national honour demanded it&quot;. Gladstone and other anti-imperialists reluctantly relinquished their dream of a &quot;Little England&quot; and Egypt gradually became part of the Victorian tapestry.<br />To this stage came &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon -pious, dedicated, and eccentric. As a former governor-general of the Sudan, he was pressed into service to effect the withdrawal of Egyptian forces from that province which, it was concluded, could not be held against the mystic leader, the Mahdi. To this scene in turn came Gordon's old comrade-in-arms, Garnet Wolseley, brave and capable, but also &quot;vain, pompous, and scheming&quot;. It was Wolseley who, in masterminding the daring expedition up the Nile to rescue Gordon from the Mahdi, recalled the special aptitudes of Canadian voyageurs from his earlier military life in Canada, and it was he who was mainly responsible for Canadian involvement.<br />Before the final defeat of the Mahdists in 1898, many Canadians won distinction in these distant imperial expeditions which, &quot;paradoxically,&quot; the author concludes, &quot;contributed to the impetus to full Canadian nationhood&quot;, as Canadians became more aware through their military achievements of their separate experience and identity.                       1978, Univ. of British Columbia,  first Canadian ed w/dj,   6 x 9, 184 pp, illus &amp; maps.	2001-09-18

US	44698583	RQ44M37C1DYJW	8170621380	218287562	War in High Himalaya: The Indian Army in Crisis, 1962	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A detailed history of a little known campaign	The circumstances attending the disastrous campaign that followed the Chinese invasion of India's Himalayan borders have never been clearly understood. Even today, some. three decades after the ceasefire of November 1962, very little official information has been made available to the public or the press about that brief but traumatic episode.<br />The present menoir is therefore all the more welcome, not only because it comes from the pen of one who is an established writer and commentator on military affairs but also because, as Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters during that fateful period, he both witnessed and took part in the processes, through which government policies were formulated and the decision taken to go to war against the Chinese, in circumstances that must have indicated inevitable catastrophe.<br />General Palit describes with refreshing candour the ad hoc nature of the decisionmaking apparatus at prime ministerial and cabinet levels, the lack of any samblance of coordinated staff analyses, the over-reach of government into the responsibilities of the military, and the quiescence of the latter in permitting it. He is uninhibited in recording facts as he saw them and the opinions he held at the time, though always careful to distinguish between that and hind-sight rationalization. While commenting on the actions of others the author is also frankly and disarmingly self-critical.	2001-09-17

This is a story of anticipation, of impending actions, ofvirtual equality of forces engaged in a savage battle of attrition in which no quarters were given or asked.<br />The author, GOC-in-C Western Command during those fateful days provided an essential element of higher command, an unflappable presence under whose command the Army imposed unacceptable levels of losses on the enemy, first toning down their rhetoric, then their confidence, and lastly their ability to sustain very high levels of material losses.<br />There is very little material or records to draw upon for our military studies of warfare in and around the Indian subcontinent. War Despatches narrates for the first time the inside story through original despatches filed by the Army Commander from the war zone.<br />To maintain the authenticity of the Despatches, the military style of writing has been followed in the text as far as possible.	2001-09-17
US	44698583	RJ241T76KCBEV	0747222819	530312391	Kota Mama	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Superb adventure account	IN 1998 AND 1999 legendary explorer Colonel John Blashford-Snell led one of the most ambitious expeditions since Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki. It was an epic journey that spanned a continent and provided evidence that ancient South American peoples could have been trading with Africa 1,000 years before Christ.<BR>Intrigued first of all by the idea that Plato's Atlantis might have been on a vast Bolivian plain high in the Andes, then fascinated by the notion that pre-Inca people and their trade goods might have found their way down central South America's massive rivers to the Atlantic and even across it, Blashford-Snell commissioned a fleet of traditional reed boats - the largest named Kota Mama - in which to test these theories. He navigated a route, in two phases, from Lake Titicaca to Buenos Aires, which took him and his companions through terrain of stark contrasts: from Bolivia's high Altiplano, through steamy Brazilian rain-forests and the arid thorn scrub of Paraguay's Gran Chaco, and finally to the Argentinian capital where their achievement was widely acknowledged.<BR>John Blashford-Snell and Richard Snailham recount their amazing story of adventure and discovery, of lost civilizations and little-known archaeological sites, and of seventy-five people whose combined efforts ensured the success of the Kota Mama Expedition.	2001-09-07
