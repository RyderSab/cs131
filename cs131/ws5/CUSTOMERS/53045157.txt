Holland on the other hand makes his points with due respect for alternate perspectives, but with tenacity. His is the kind of book that all will find informative, and many will find persuasive. I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.	2001-02-12

That said, Dover has published a good-quality miniature  score of this work from the &quot;Bach-Gesellschaft&quot; (19th century  complete works) edition.  I bought Dover's reprint as a replacement for a  miniature score by another publisher (which also reprinted  Bach-Gesellschaft), a particularly nasty piece of work with blotchy print,  nearly illegible at many points--especially in the figured bass!--and much  smaller than the present reprint.  Dover does the job as it should be done,  and up to its usual standard.<br />It is true, as another reviewer has noted,  that the format of the &quot;BG&quot; score is somewhat antiquated,  particularly with regard to the old-style clefs (i.e., soprano and tenor  clefs rather than treble clefs) in the vocal parts.  And since this score  was originally published nearly a century and a half ago, no doubt there  have been strides in Bach scholarship since that time which are not  reflected in this volume.  Nevertheless, this is a reliable and useful  reproduction of what is unquestionably a significant and valuable edition.	2000-09-17
US	53045157	R11ZGBADNKJG8B	0198162383	320783166	The Letters of C. P. E. Bach	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Scholarly edition of an important composer's letters	This thoroughly-annotated volume is a necessary corollary to any  biographical study done on C.P.E. Bach.  It is, however, not by any means  as complete a picture as one would like; only four of the 338 numbered  letters in Prof. Clark's volume date from before 1760, when the composer  was 46 years old; some of the known letters survive only in fragments  quoted in old auction catalogues, the originals subsequently being lost;  and many of the letters whose full texts survive are to the publisher  Breitkopf, with whom C.P.E. sustained a working relationship spanning more  than two decades.  <br />Thus a great deal of the book involves Emanuel's  communicating his wishes to Breitkopf (Breitkopf's answers are occasionally  summarized in Prof. Clark's extensive footnotes) regarding publications  which Breitkopf would print on the composer's behalf and then help him  distribute.  Emanuel's occasional bursts of irritation at the publisher  (e.g., &quot;You, shameful compatriot!  How can you bring your heart to let  me roast in uncertainty over a slow fire, wondering whether you have  received my manuscript sent right after the holidays?&quot; [Letter 238, 4  Feb. 1784]) are amusing, and seeing how a composer of the time planned,  proof-corrected, and distributed an 18th century publication is intriguing.   There are also a couple of letters to J.N. Forkel, the early biographer of  J.S. Bach, where Emanuel shares information regarding his celebrated  father.  <br />Those who hope for a detailed portrait of Emanuel will likely  be less than satisfied due to the fact that so much of the correspondence  has undoubtedly been lost.  But Prof. Clark's book is everything that could  be wished for in a detailed edition in English of this correspondence.  My  awarding this book less than five stars is by no means to be understood as  a reflection on Clark's work, which is uniformly excellent, but to the high  price relative to the size of the book--which is just over three hundredpages including bibliography and index--and the specialized nature of the  book.  General readers should investigate the *New Grove Bach Family* for  an overview of Emanuel before tackling this kind of scholarly work.	2000-09-10

Dover's title page states that it is &quot;edited  from the autograph manuscript,&quot; but gives no further details (i.e., no  critical commentary [assuming Einstein provided one], nor even the original  date of publication).  However, a translation of the Latin text is given  immediately before the score. <br />The score is given in a clear, legible  format and should be useful to lovers of Pergolesi's masterpiece, which was  an immediate hit in the 18th century (not that it did Pergolesi much good;  he died the year it was completed, at age 26) and inspired scores of  adaptations, including one by J.S. Bach.  The music foreshadows  post-Baroque trends such as Rococco (&quot;Quae moerebat et dolebat,&quot;  No. 4, is a case in point). A good and inexpensive edition.	2000-08-23

The translations are servicable, but this particular volume badly needs the revision that other  Loeb volumes have been receiving under the skilled hand of G.P. Goold,  currently general editor of the series.  The translations of the Juvenal  satires in the current volume have been censored where Juvenal was  evidently felt by the standards of 1918 to have been too indecent (cf.  II.49-50 for an example; the Latin, however, is untouched).  While one can  understand the reticience of the editor given his era, this censorship  should really be remedied in a future revision (as it has been in the Loeb  &quot;Catullus&quot; edited by Goold).  Until then Peter Green's fine  translation for Penguin contains a complete rendering which will allow the  reader to judge for himself or herself whether or not to be shocked by what  Juvenal says.	2000-07-17

Rouse which first appeared in 1924; Smith also adds his own valuable  introduction on the life and works of Lucretius.  <br />The poem itself is  diffuse, with flashes of considerable brilliance, but some awfully  primitive &quot;scientific&quot; notions (probably unavoidable given the  times in which Lucretius wrote).  As far as what has been considered  &quot;atheism&quot; on Lucretius' part (though wrongly, as Lucretius does  not deny that gods exist--only that they have any bearing on human  affairs), and his disbelief in any kind of afterlife, I have to agree with  John Dryden that such teachings are the opposite of what is likely to  instill a sense of morality in the reader, as Lucretius apparently intended  to instill in Memmius, the person he addresses in the poem; said Dryden,  &quot;...to take away rewards and punishments, is only a pleasing prospect  to a man, who resolves beforehand not to live morally. But on the other  side, the thought of being nothing after death is insupportable to a  vertuous man...&quot; (Preface to Sylvae).<br />The Loeb edition also has  helpful glosses in the margins opposite the English translation, which are  very helpful signposts to aid the reader in finding his way around  Lucretius' often complex argumentation.  Highly recommended.	2000-07-17

The score itself is beautifully engraved and Dover has  helpfully translated the editors' commentary at the end of the score, which  notes deviations from Mozart's autograph and supplements from other early  ms. sources.  There is also a running German translation of the words to  the opera along with the original Italian (the German is probably  immaterial to most users today, but given the original publication date and  origin of the edition, it is quite understandable why it was included by  the editors). Anyone who loves this opera will undoubtedly find this a  valuable and useful score to have.	2000-07-09

James White's book claims to be &quot;a plea for understanding&quot; in the continuing discussion over Bible versions (p. 249). However, it is marked by its author's profound misunderstanding of those who differ with  him. The substance of White's charges is much less impressive than the  smooth writing. He assures us, on p. VII, that he has endeavored to be  fair, but time after time, we find a double standard laid down by the  author: the rules are generous when modern versions are questioned, but  strict and even unfair when applied to the KJV or its adherents. This may  seem severe but is easily documented:<br />1. White recommends: &quot;Whenever  you encounter a supposed 'change' in the Bible's text [in modern  translations], take time to look carefully at the available information.  You will discover that there are reasons for the differences...&quot; (p.  146). But our author has failed to allow the same latitude to the KJV. Mr.  White often blames the KJV for the fact that he himself does not understand  a rendering and did not bother to check an unabridged dictionary to educate  himself (e.g., pp. 145-6 [2 Tim. 3:12], p. 233 [Acts  12:4--&quot;Easter&quot; means &quot;Passover&quot;], p. 226 [1 Cor. 4:4]),  p. 225 [Lk. 18:12], p. 238, note 3 [Mk. 6:20: the &quot;inferior&quot; KJV  reading means exactly the same thing as the NAS reading!], ). White also  writes that &quot;while it is true that heretics down through the ages have  appealed to this text or that, we must not allow the misuse of biblical  texts to determine the readings we choose for the text of Scripture&quot;  (p. 258); however, Acts 9:7 &amp; 22:9 in the KJV are to be condemned based  on the understanding of Mormons, and Matt. 13:18 &amp; Rom. 13:9 based on  that of a &quot;nationally known atheist&quot; (pp. 228-9).<br />2. White  complains that Gail Riplinger associates modern scholars with Charles  Manson, &quot;the Mormon prophet Brigham Young,&quot; Jehovah's Witnesses,  and New Agers(p. 122, note 5). Yet how is White's linkage of KJV adherents  to &quot;Roman Catholics&quot; looking to an &quot;infallible pope,&quot;  to Mormons seeking guidance from &quot;the Prophet and Apostles in Salt  Lake City,&quot; and to Jehovah's Witnesses looking to their Watchtower  headquarters (pp. 93-4) any different? Or his association of &quot;KJV Only  advocates&quot; with readings found in the &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses' New  World Translation&quot; (p. 267)?<br />3. White complains that in Peter S.  Ruckman's writings &quot;those who present the facts are to be insulted,  belittled, and identified as 'Alexandrians,'&quot; (p. 115), but asserts  his own right to use pejorative terms (&quot;KJV Only,&quot; &quot;KJV  Onlyism&quot;) because they are not &quot;insulting&quot; or  &quot;inaccurate&quot;--according to him!--but represent a group which uses  modern translations &quot;only to point out how bad and inaccurate they  allegedly are&quot; (p. 248). He also complains of &quot;Blustery words and  insulting invective&quot; (p. 247) from Ruckman, but indulges in some  notable bluster of his own: &quot;The [KJV] position is, by its nature,  anti-intellectual, anti-scholarship, and anti-freedom&quot; (p. 151).<br />4.  Numerous other faults of research, authorial grasp, and presentation might  be cited if space allowed. E.g., White seems to grossly misrepresent  Aland's concept of &quot;tenacity&quot; of the New Testament text to mean  that &quot;once a variant reading appears in a manuscript, it doesn't  simply go away&quot; (p. 48)--which would mean that every scribal miscopy  in every Greek manuscript ever written has been providentially preserved,  something far more against the odds that the beliefs White attacks. Also,  White defines &quot;conjectural emendation&quot; as a change &quot;made to  the text without any evidence from the manuscripts&quot; (p. 63)--a gross  oversimplification, since &quot;evidence&quot; can be more than the fact  that a text ata given point doesn't read X; an editor can make a case for  copyist eye-skip or transposition of letters, or draw on analogous passages  in the edited work, all of which draw broadly on the ms's  &quot;evidence.&quot; Such emendation is used literally thousands of times  in Greek and Latin classical authors, and while one might argue as to  whether or not it is appropriate for the Bible, an author who, like White,  is not overly concerned about precision in defining this critical term  forfeits the reader's confidence in other areas.<br />White has not only a  bias--reasonable in an apologetic work--but an outright prejudice against  the KJV adherents' position. It may be that the author resents KJV  apologetics so much, and is so convinced that they smack of double  standards (and not always without cause, since some are poorly reasoned, as  are a portion of writings on any controversial position), that he is  overcompensating without even realizing it, taking &quot;revenge&quot; with  some double standards of his own by writing this seriously flawed  polemic.<br />George Orwell's observation in writing about the Spanish Civil  War--&quot;The truth, it is felt, becomes untruth when your enemy utters  it&quot;--certainly reflects the attitude of some of White's partisans, as  does the converse: that inaccuracy becomes &quot;truth&quot;--or 'good  enough'--as long as it serves its purpose against &quot;KJV Onlies.&quot;   (See the book cover blurbs, by men who should have had enough scholarship  to know better, for proof of this.)  White shows himself in this book to be  to the &quot;controversy&quot; what Jackie Collins is to great literature.  Unfortunately, too many on White's side of the aisle are trying to make him  out to be Ernest Hemingway, which is much more profound a statement on the  &quot;controversy&quot; than anything in White's book. Some of his backers  seem interested in nothing but scoring points, fair or not, off the  opposition; White's inaccurate but highly polished writing will no doubt be  useful as propaganda to this end.	1999-07-30

The scenes where Paul Scofield as Malvolio is deceived with a forged letter into thinking that Olivia loves him have a side-splitting humor that comes through even though the play is nearly 400 years old.

Pope makes Homer sound like someone worth reading, rather than like a mouldy fossil from three thousand years ago.

However, Lincoln's own well-meaning assembling of the received text of these debates used only transcripts from papers friendly to either candidate--transcripts which, Harold Holzer argues, were smoothed over and revised by reporters eager to make &quot;their&quot; candidate look good.  Holzer insists that we must go to the transcripts of Lincoln's speeches by the pro-Douglas paper, and vice-versa, to get a true sense of what was said off the cuff by the debaters.  His edition portrays vividly not only the high-sounding rhetoric of Douglas and the noble ideals of Lincoln, but also the hesitations and mis-speakings of both men.

Thus anyone who wishes to understand the reasons why humans bind themselves into societies, and what the obligations of a people and their government should be to each other, should read this book.  Peter Laslett provides an excellent edition with an extensive introduction (over 100 pages!) and copious notes.  Locke is definitely deep reading, but those who are not afraid to ponder the whys and wherefores of government will be greatly rewarded	1997-04-14

Not only is the score of this set of Vivaldi's Op. 8 concertos--consisting of the &quot;Four Seasons&quot; and eight other works--freshly edited from a computer database version of the 1725 first edition by Dr. Eleanor Selfridge-Field, but it is beautifully typeset and contains ample &quot;Critical Notes&quot; and variant passages.  And the price is an outright steal!  Every lover of Vivaldi owes it to himself or herself to get this magnificent score	1997-04-14

Frame's translations of fourteen Moliere comedies (seven in this volume and another seven in *Tartuffe and Other Plays*) are delightful.  Not that Moliere's plays have lacked for translators; some versions have made the comedies leaden and dull, while others have added their own luster to the text in a way that distorts Moliere's intentions.  Frame is more faithful to the original text than some earlier translators, while his verse does an admirable job of conveying the comic &quot;thrust&quot; that Moliere must have envisioned. <br />  Any translation of this playwright must be compared against the sparkling verse renditions of Richard Wilbur.  I personally find Frame to more than hold his own here, and in fact in *The Misanthrope* to do better in giving us the sense of the author stylishly, but without the translator &quot;stealing the spotlight&quot; as much as happens in Wilbur's brilliant version.  Frame's version is excellent throughout and augmented by informative introductions and notes	1997-04-14

But changing poetic fashions and a self-righteousness among his commentators impaired his reputation.  Maynard Mack remedies such trends in the first biography this century covering Pope's whole life.  The writing sparkles, the facts are fully documented, and there is something of the detail that helps the reader feel he or she &quot;knows&quot; Pope by the end.  We catch something of the courage that it took for Pope to rise from physical and political disabilities that would have crippled lesser individuals, to speak for reason and liberty in the face of enemies like Sir Robert Walpole, an utterly unethical individual who was the first Prime Minister of Great Britain.  We also sense the pathos of things that Pope could not transcend: for example, his inability to find romantic intimacy due to his physical deformity.  Prof. Mack has crafted a remarkable and informative book that should interest both the scholar and the casual reader	1997-04-06

Some of his deficiencies stand out markedly in &quot;Age of Reason,&quot; where his attempts to discredit what he calls &quot;the stupid texts of the bible&quot; actually highlight his own misunderstanding and the gaps in his education (which was largely self-achieved).  His natural wit comes to the fore in his superb Revolutionary War propaganda pieces ridiculing the British generals who were then besieging the colonists.  And his extreme bravery and committment to principle appears in his speech, when serving as a delegate to the French Assembly just as the Reign of Terror was beginning, pleading for the life of Louis XVI .  Eric Foner has chosen the pieces well and supplies excellent notes, and the volume is up to the usual high typographical and binding standards of the Library of America.  Highly recommended	1997-03-21

Richard Holmes gives us a picture of the man before he became a living legend, when Johnson was destitute, wandering the streets all night because he had no money for lodgings--and friends with the notorious Richard Savage.  In bringing Savage back to life--a man full of wild poetic genius but too erratic to create works worthy of it--, Holmes reconstructs 18th century London and gives us intriguing glimpses into the influences that made Johnson the literary lion that he became.  Holmes' deconstruction of Johnson's &quot;Life of Savage&quot; reveals the substantial emotional ties that Johnson had to his wayward friend.  Fascinating reading and tremendous scholarship	1997-02-18

Doug Moston has written a fine and informative introduction to this reprint, mainly from the vantage point of the needs of today's actors.  But scholars and Shakespeare lovers will want to have this book, too, since the First Folio is of major importance for the establishment of Shakespeare's texts, and for checking the conjectures of generations of editors who have tried to &quot;fix&quot; readings in the text that they thought were misprints.  This is an essential reference and a fun book to browse, too	1997-02-17

They aren't boring at all in the hands of Prof. Alan Tyson.  Through painstaking analysis of the kinds of paper Mozart used, Tyson is able to do some fascinating detective work--including the redating of several works, and the finding that Mozart's Horn Concerto in D (K. 412) was not even completed by him, but was finished after his death by his pupil Suessmayr!  Tyson also recovers some &quot;lost&quot; music from Mozart's opera &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot; and the ending of the Rondo for Piano and Orchestra, K. 386.   These wonders are presented in writing that is sober enough to be credible, but is never dull.  Anyone who loves Mozart's music will find a treasury of fascinating new finds and information in this book.	1997-02-17
