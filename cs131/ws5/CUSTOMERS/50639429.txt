The book attempts to somehow bind the post-modern critiques of science to the Hindu challenge to the Orientalist constructions of India. Given that the Hindu challenge goes back to at least Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda, much before post-modern ideas arose, this binding makes no sense. Also, the connections between Vedanta and modern physics have been advanced by great scientists like Schrodinger and Heisenberg and their more recent followers, therefore to see a Hindu conspiracy in this is unreasonable.	2004-01-12

The book is definitely the best general resource the reader will find on Hinduism. Unlike other texts that present an Orientalist view of Hinduism, Klostermaier lets the tradition speaks for itself. For a book of this size, dealing with a tradition as rich and complex as Hinduism, it is natural that the reader will not always agree with the author. But Professor Klostermaier tries to be as fair in his presentation as is possible.<br />The book should be a successful textbook to teach Hinduism at the college level.	2004-01-12

It pits the 19th century linguistics orthodoxy about the chronology of the Vedic people against a diverse set of scholars. On the one hand, you have the archaeologists who are completely against the racist basis of the linguists' framework; on the other, you have most Sanskritists and historians of astronomy who claim that the internal evidence within the Vedic books goes against the linguists' chronology. Bryant conflates all these diverse scholars with &quot;Hindu nationalists&quot;, suggesting a political agenda behind the views!<br />He has created a false dichotomy of AIT and OIT. In fact, most of the scholars who reject AIT reject its chronology of invasions or immigration around 2000 BC, preferring to stay silent on the situation before 4000 BC or so.<br />The intellectural framework for the book is weak. Its one redeeming feature is that it brings together many different views. Bryant is to be commended for not taking sides too brazenly.	2002-01-29

'Subhash Kak presents what is arguably the most complete, articulate and up-to-date overview on the entire Indic tradition. More notably, he speaks not from a dry academic  standpoint but from one in contact with the very soul and spirit of the culture. His panoramic view covers spirituality, science, linguistics and history, making clear India's important role in world civilization past, present and future. He dispels the many current distortions and misinterpretations of India, the cobwebs of colonial and Eurocentric thinking, and reveals her vast  civilization in its true light. Everyone interested in India and in human civilization will be fascinated and transformed by his many-sided insights. They will never look at India again in the same way.' This is how David Frawley describes the book and I believe that is a fair assessment. The book is based on lectures at Stanford and California universities.	2002-01-03

I believe this is what Subhash Kak also seems to say in his foreword to the book. In other words, this book is not about physics but rather it represents the connections between the physical world and the structure of the mind. One might call this subject speculative physics or metaphysics. It is not the clearest exposition of such metaphysics, and this made me struggle to decide whether to give the book two stars or three stars.

Keay has failed us like the previous authors weaned on the colonialist school of  historiography. The tone is set by the unfortunate repetition by Keay of  the now discredited Aryan invasion theory (see the recent books by Kenoyer,  Gupta, and Lal for the archaelogical findings establishing a continuity  that goes back to 6500 BC). I hope the author will soon bring out a revised  and corrected version of this book.	2000-06-04

Althoughthe book is an improvement on many others on the subject by its consideration of the ethnic and linguistic complexities of the region, it suffers from its over-reliance on the leftist viewpoint...  But in spite of its obvious failings the book will be useful to many readers who wish to get started on the subject.<br />We are waiting to see if her new book on Kashmir will be more insightful.	2000-06-04

Some of my most fond memories are about the time spent at these hill stations as a boy. So we do need a writer to  communicate this magic to the wide world. Unfortunately, Crossette is not  this writer. She doesn't approach the places with any sympathy, let alone  the reverence they deserve. Crossette is too eager to peddle her political  and social theories about the divide between the highlands and the  lowlands, races and religions. These theories are too simplistic and they  detract from the narrative.	2000-06-04

This rant is largely incoherent and quite inconsistent in the manner it analyzes the problem of American racism and the response of the mainstream of Indians in the US. Quite in the style of  the old Commuunist pamphleteers, Prashad concludes thus: &quot;The fights  are endless and our leftist morality must draw us consistently to the front  lines, whether for taxi workers in New York, auto workers in Michigan and  Mexico, or landless peasants in Peru and Bangladesh...	2000-05-15

Science books often do not speak of the limitations of their discipline; this book does, and that is its main virtue. It is mainly an overview of modern physics, but it connects that up nicely to old Indic ideas about  space, time, and consciousness. The printing and type-setting are not good,  but if the reader can ignore that, he or she will find the book worthwhile.	2000-04-28

The book  remembers Kashmir and it describes other imagined worlds that make it  possible for us to relate to reality. Should be read with Kak's Hindi book  Ek Taal, Ek Darpan.	2000-04-26

Sen's work, a repackaging of Marxist ideas modified for our post-Marxian times, has always advocated more state control and now, when such prescriptions have been shown to be counter-productive (they led to India losing half a  century), he has made a strategic shift to the anarchian position. The idea  being that the resulting disorder will ultimately strengthen Marxist ideas.	2000-04-23

Rushdie's writing is pitched at a variety of consitituencies: the PC crowd, the feminists, and so on. But great writing cannot emerge without a  strong focus and consistency in purpose. I re-read this book last night and  was sorely disappointed. I'd say that `Satanic Verses' is Rushdie's best  book.<br />While Rushdie plays to the gallery he has alienated most  spectators. The Muslims are mad with him for SV, the non-Muslims think he  is insincere when he says he is still a Muslim.	2000-01-11

(You need to invest on security, India has some very dangerous neighbors.) Roy's analysis of why India's development has  been slow is just plain wrong. Basically, she parrots the Marxist view,  which refuses to recognizes that India's problem is its bureaucracy.	1999-12-03
