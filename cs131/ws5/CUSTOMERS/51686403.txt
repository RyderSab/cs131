The only reason I finished this book was because I spent so much money on it. It didn't keep my attention at all, because the characters are unlikable and underdeveloped.

Bet Me is a fun book--great main and secondary characters (Min being round and plump was great!) and great banter.What distracted me from the book was the number of props and lines in the book that have appeared in Crusie's other books--Dove Bars, ragged orphan animals and reference to rum and Cokes as wimpy drinks, to note a few. It got to the point I was looking for them, and I found I was getting more and more disappointed when I would find them. <br />Crusie writes well and the bantering is fantastic, but the lack of freshness did the book no favor.	2004-02-13

Goddesses of Kitchen Avenue is more women's lit than romance, which means it is more about women finding &quot;themselves&quot; than finding love, although there is still a smidgen of romance. The book is really about the stories of two women who live on Kitchen Avenue, but it is written as though it is about the stories of four women who live on Kitchen Avenue. The extra two stories are completely superfulous to the book, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book. The book is moving, sometimes trite, but always enjoyable.<br />I wish it wasn't two conjoined stories and had more romance, but overall it is a well-written, solid read.	2004-02-06

Daisy's Back in Town lacks the sparkle and freshness found in Rachel Gibson's past books. With DBIT, she is unable to find a fresh perspective on a very common romance novel plotline (a woman comes back to her hometown with a child her old flame knew nothing about.) She has created characters that are either boring or annoying.  I missed the amusing, quirky, Doc Martin-wearing female found in her other books. Here, Daisy is very beige and uninteresting.  Jack, the lead male, on the other hand, has too much character. He is a whiner full of angst, which made finding any compassion for his situation very difficult; throughout the book, I found myself thinking, \\"Sheesh, get over it already!\\" <br />As a fan of Rachel Gibson, I can't recommend this book.	2004-01-27

I bought Once upon a Wedding because I am a huge fan of Kathleen Eagle. I should have known something was up when I saw the pink and pastel colored cover; her books, in the past, have never been pink and pastel; they are rich and earthy.<br />The story was forgettable with forgettable characters. Camille and her friends are in their late forties, but act and speak like they are in their eighties. Frump this; frump that. <br />Camille, who is openly concerned and whiny about her daughter dropping out of college, doesn't bat an eyelash when the daughter announces she is going to marry a childhood crush she met the day before at a wedding. Huh? If you are going to whine about something, this would be a good thing to crank about.<br />I don't know what happens in the end. Maybe she gets upset. I don't know...I couldn't make it past page 60. <br />If you like gather-around-the-girlfriends chick books flavored with a beige plot, this book is for you. If not, save your money and buy one of her other books.	2002-09-24

The characters are very flat, especially the lead character, Elena. Hoag tries to write her as a strong character, but fails; she confuses emotional void with inner strength. The story and its development are impressive, but it lacks the depth and color one expects of her books.<br />I view Hoag's books as romantic suspense, as many do. Although this book is cleverly suspenseful, it isn't very romantic.	2002-09-24

After reading The Survivors Club by Lisa Gardner, I really needed to read a book that was well-written, but soft on  emotions. Out of my Amazon pile, I selected No Place Like Home, because of its simple title and a cover that looked like it belonged on a feminine hygiene product. Not surprising, the book is very well-written and believeable, as all Barbara Samuel aka Ruth Wind books are, but it is also very moving and real...and not soft on emotions. This beautiful book tells a story about life, loss and living; it is well-written and filled with characters overflowing in depth and color.

I purchased the book, because it was listed on so many Manias. When I saw the cheesy cover, I had an idea what lay ahead. Although, the story-line of the book is interesting, the follow-through is lacking. It isn't suspenseful, at all. When a book only mentions two people who could possibly be the bad guy in question and one of them is murdered, it isn't too hard to figure out who did it. Also, the book is filled with ridiculous, over-used descriptions of interesting body parts. If an author isn't able to write clever descriptions, call the parts by their real names; it may not be fresh, but at least it isn't comical.<br />If you are looking for a romantic novel that doesn't require any thought or imagination, Lone Rider is for you.	2002-09-09

She has penned a great book about insidous rape. The Survivors Club is about three survivors of a serial rapist, who form a club to help them learn to live with the nightmare and to ensure it doesn't find its way to the \\"dead case\\" files. The book is so wonderfully written, the reader may find themselves peering over the top of the book to make sure the Dark Shape hasn't creeped in when they weren't looking! As I read it, I wondered if men would find the book as disturding as women; they don't live with the perpetual fear of rape. But the author's ability to paint the horror so realistically makes it disturbing and frightening for any reader, whether they are a man or woman.<br />If you wish to read a great, suspenseful book The Survivors Club is for you.	2002-09-09

The Day We Met is about a man and woman who fall in love the first time their eyes meet; this is not an uncommon theme in romance books. What is uncommon with TDWM's approach is Maggy's and Conor's realistis panic, when they realize they're connected the moment they see each other. Both Conor, Maggy, and their families question the speed and the intensity of the relationship. But still they can't deny what their hearts are screaming at them. Never through the book will the reader find themselves doing an \\"yeah, sure\\" eye roll, which probably happens with most \\"love at first sight\\" books. <br />There is only one part of the book I truly didn't understand and felt didn't fit in with the realistic rhythm of the book. Conor, a cop, and his partner were involved in a carjacking. During the struggle to apprehend the suspect, the partner is killed. Conor is suspected of freezing in place, instead of doing all he can do to protect his partner. Throughout the book, it is plainly shown this event, the question of his part in the death of his partner, and his appearance in court are the most trying and important events of his life. When Conor has to testify in court, Maggy never offers to go to court with him to support him. Instead, she states she has a study group, has to work at bit and spend some time with her kids. Huh? This man is supposedly her \\"soul mate\\" and she leaves him facing his fears by himself? This scene in the book doesn't fit in with the rest of the book, and it takes a huge chunk out of the believability of the book.<br />TDWM, although good, would be a keeper if it wasn't for Maggy's selfish decision to let Conor face his fears alone, as a true love never would.	2002-09-08

The cleverly suspenseful plot was entertaining and the characters believeable. I especially liked that Genna Snow was as smart, if not smarter, than her male counterparts. Often when the lead female character and the lead male character work for the FBI or some other exciting government position, the male character seems to always be smarter and more intuitive than the female character. The author did a great job of bringing out the professional strenghts of Genna and John and the understandable romantic tension between them. You won't go wrong purchasing this book.	2002-08-31

TRUE BLUE is a novel which is well-written and thoughtful, and, for the most part, characteristically disappointing. Although I found myself dripping a few tears for the lead character, Rumer, I wasn't sure if it was because of the way her sister and childhood best friend/young adulthood boy friend, Zeb, pillaged her heart or the extremely cowardly way she handled the whole situation. During their college years, a note from Zeb was left for Rumer to meet him at the Indian Grave to consummate their relationship. Rumer didn't get the note because her sister hid the note. Zeb, who \\"loves\\" Rumer, didn't believe she never got it; he believes she is just afraid to make love to him and just won't tell him. Now, this is the woman whose heart was connected to his \\"by a golden thread,\\" yet he won't believe she didn't get the note. (Huh?) So instead of confronting her, he sleeps with her beautiful sister because she will put out. Eventually they marry and divorce in ten years. Twenty years later, he comes back home because he finally realizes Rumer is one he truly loves. Does Rumer ever rage at him for the way he tossed their love away because he didn't believe her when she explained about the note? Does she rage at him for going to her sister because she is beautiful and generous with her body? Does she rage at him because he destroyed an incredible relationship they had since they were kids? No, no, and no; she never does. At the end of the book, she FINALLY rages at her sister because she stole Zeb. But with Zeb, she just accepts the way he killed their relationship over a disputed note that could have been settled by talking about it; the way the book implies they talked about everything the throughout the time they were growing up. I can honestly say if Rumer had been a woman who fights for what is hers...as most women would have done...I would have really loved TRUE BLUE. The wimpy way she handled the situation sadly robbed the book of its true emotion and true intelligence.<br />Also, although the book was well-written, I started to become distracted by the number of colons that appeared on a given page; there seemed to be more than on a busy day at the proctologist.	2002-08-25

This book was so drowsy, I had to stop reading it half way through; it was a cliche romance novel with absolutely no suspense. (Well, it may have had a bit, but I couldn't stay awake to experience it.) All in all...this book should be rated &quot;Z&quot; for zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.	2002-05-16

(Not with the B&J, of course.;)) I was expecting a great, quirky, smart heroine, not the bland, silly heroine Lola turns out to be. What sexy bra and thong model would get seriously upset about some naked pictures on the 'net?...and would a person really get someone to pay $25 to see them? No. When Lola realizes a stranger is on the boat, why didn't she pick up her cell phone instead of a flare gun?  It is all so far-fetched, and ultimately, disappointing. Hopefully, Gibson's next book will showcase her obvious talent revealed in Truly, Madly Yours and True Confessions, because it certainly isn't revealed here.	2002-04-16

Where are the confusing calculations?	They are not found in this refreshing book and program. As a member of iVillage.com, I have had the opportunity to put this program and its author to test. Shape Up teaches one to find the value of a food beyond its caloric value. Because the program introduces healthy habits and foods gently and encourages the weaning of less favorable foods and habits, the probability of a person succeeding at losing weight and gaining a healthy body is great. The book is well written with witty stories and easily understood explanations of the science behind Shape Up. I encourage anyone interested in improving their health to purchase this book.	2001-04-16
