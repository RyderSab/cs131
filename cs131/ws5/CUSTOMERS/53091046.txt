It did not read like a typical bio at all. The first two chapters were about the previous collaborative biographers of Sammy's and their writing and publishing nightmares of _Yes I Can_. I couldn't tell if this book was about Sammy or his previous biographers. The narrative is fragmented and repetitive. The story was too roundabout to capture my interest. I found it infuriating and I gave up half way through.  Sorry I cannot give this bio a good recommendation.	2004-08-17

This series provides a detailed overview of what is happening in the country socially and culturally, in addition to politically. I like that I learn not only about the two presidents ; but also, I was given details on many of the other major political figures of the time. An extensive use of primary sources is used, and the author makes an effort to discuss how previous biographers have presented each president, how the presidents have been viewed at different points in history, and how this account sees the presidents. This is a sympathetic biography of both, but the author's assessment is solidly supported with evidence. I am not a historian, just a person reading a bio of each of our past presidents. Interesting, story-telling. I did not find this work boring and dry. It also sets the stage for the Civil War and explores the issues that help build toward war.	2004-07-12

The articles do not flow smoothly<BR>and the book is not to be read as a history flowing from one chapter to another. I do not feel this is a useful history of Italy. It is not an easily understood survey, and the writings expect too much previous knowledge of the history of Italy to be appealing to a beginning reader.	2004-01-13

I'm not sure if I would have been better off reading a general bio on Polk first, becuase this book is very biased, as the author admits. The argument is that Polk's policy was stronly influenced by him being a slaveowner. That Polk had conflicting interests because he ran several plantations in Tn and Miss and he was using the money from the plantations to secure himself a post-presidential retirement.<br />The book is organized in an interesting way. It begins by describing Polk's plantations and what it was like for the slaves , plus gives details regarding the overseers,a nd Polk's policies regarding purchasing  and selling of slaves. Polk endeavored to hide what he was doing from the general public and his reasons for selling and guying were definitley not always patriarchal, but monetary.<br />Polk died a few months after leaving office, and none or few of his papers were destroyed, hence we have a record of what ocurred on the plantations.<br />the second half of the book covers the main aspects of Polk's presidential career --annexation of Tx and the MX War. The author discusses the events through the lens of slavery and tried to argue Polk's descisions were heavily influenced by Polk being a slaveowner. the author presents many what-ifs, discussing a vairety of  other scenarios that could have happened during Polk's presidency had he made other choices. I found these diversions to be a strength of the book instead of an irritant. The book gave me a lot to think about,a nd it was particulary interesting to learn the details of what Polk plantation life was like.	2003-11-15

This books reads more like eight long essay with footnotes. <br />Slaughter compares Lewis and Clark values and views with that of the Indians they encountered. He considers the difference between dream states (natives) and rational scientific explanations (L&amp;C) for the phenomena they experienced.<br />One chapter looks at the role of Sacajawea and deeply explores the two versions of her death.  Another chapter looks at York and his role in the expedition and what happened between York and Clark afterwards.<br />This book is essentially an interpretation of the journals, as 90 % of his citations are from the journals themselves.<br />The tone is often sarcastic and critical and even tries to be cute. I found myself challenging and disagreeing with many of Slaughter's assertions.<br />The chapter on hunting was fascinating. It describes the Native view of hunting versus Lewis and Clark's view of killing.<br />Here and there I found things to think about in this book and different ways of looking at episodes of the expedition already much documented. If you are a fan of the expedition, you should find some provocative ideas here, and it is worth wading through the mire to reach them.	2003-08-15

The author uses music in his classroom each day.  English teachers don't need to have a background in music to use this method. I give the book a 4 only because it doesn't address pure third person analysis, instead it uses music to teach first person reader response. It's great if you are teaching literature.  I teach analysis and research papers by looking at other disciplines besides literature, such as history, art, and mythology. I've wanted to bring in music, and this book has given me some excellent ideas.  The downside of the book for me is its focus on first person voice, the reader's response, whereas, I teach all third person academic voice.  I highly recommend this book, despite what I just said.  I'm planning to give a copy to a colleague who teachers first person essay writing. It would be ideal for that type of course. It is powerful to bring in other disciplines into the Eng composition class room.	2003-07-30

These are the first myths from Vietnam I've ever read, so I can't compare the tales to the standard. The stories range from creation myths to tales of wars and food/custom myths.

Tyler's presidential contributions are debated by scholars. This book highlights past scholarship and is quite detailed on the political events and people surrounding Tyler's presidency. It does an adequate job of setting the stage by explaining what was happening in American culturally and economically at the time of Tyler's term. John Tyler was a president without a party. He was despised and harangued throughout his term, and despite the trememdous pressures, he did some very important things. These acts and their later role on our nation, is well presented in Peterson's book. I still came away with mixed feelings about Tyler. I think this is because the views of him are so contradictory. Another book to compliment this one is Seager's and Tyler Too. Seager's book details Tyler, the man, and his married life to Julia Gardiner. Without reading both books it is tough to get a full picture. Highly recommended for a detailed and comprehensive look at Tyler's presidency. Well researched, many primary sources (letters) and a full bibliography in the back.	2003-07-15

It's written as a travelogue and an essay. Much of this work is opinion and more opinion.<br />What I liked -- I enjoyed the personal relfections Feiler inserts about his Judaism and his visit to Jerusalem.

I was unable to completely finish the book, because it was too-dreamlike for me.  I actually became bored, because the tone was too obvious. It's intentionally filled with questions and mystery, but for me, the lack of direct storyline made it so rambling, I eventually stopped caring what was real and what was not.<br />People who don't want a direct line, but who are in the mood for a mysterious weave, will likely enjoy this tale.

I bought this book after reading Heart of Darkness, Victory, and the Secret Sharer.  I wanted to know more about the man who wrote such haunting fiction.  The beginning of this book gives an excellent and riveting account of Conrad's parents and their political exile. After Conrad's mother dies he remains with his father in severe and isolated conditions. A detailed account of Conrad's early life helped me to understand how he wrote what he did. Quite fascinating. Also, he did visit the Congo and had experiences there that give great insight into Heart of Darkness. Including marking people he met that are models for characters in the story.  Plus he was a seaman, so we learn how he could write realistically on this subject. And we learn about Conrad's psyche, his strengths and weaknesses. I loved learning about his life, but this bio also goes into some detail about all of Conrad's novels. If you haven't read them you may become lost. If you  have read all his works this bio will definitely increase your appreciation and add to your understanding of this great writer.	2002-11-27

The editor gives a convincing argument as to why it is believed that this novel was written by a female slave in the mid-19th century. Unraveling the authorship is an intriguing mystery in and of itself. The story is part gothic--part sentimental writing style. It tells a riveting story of a young woman's journey toward freedom. Along the way she introduces the reader to a variety of slave-experiences.<br />I particularly loved the way the main character relied on god for support in times of great need. Her reliance on prayer rings with genuiness. I am not a religious person, but I was very moved by the relationship betwen god and the girl as depicted in the story. Her prayers were powerful.<br />This book is valuable both for its historical relevancy and for its story, which certainly is a page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed the gothic and sentimental tones.	2002-10-07

Our book club had selected this book and then it was rejected because of the scandal surrounding the author. I chose to read it anyway, and funny, the author accuses Jefferson of some of the same things that the author is accused of--being a liar. The best remedy is to read it along with another respected bio on Jefferson to get a balanced perspective. If a scholar is caught fabricating all sorts of things to his students, can we believe in what he writes?	2002-08-22

It brought tears to my eyes and made me laugh, and that doesn't happen often when I'm reading a book. In fact, I wish I had my own Parnassus and that I could travel the countryside selling books.<br />By the way, it's a page turner too!  A great gift idea for a friend that loves to read.

I received an overview of the history of American anthropology in less than two hundred pages. The book is broken down into historical periods such as the New Republic, Liberal Age, Postwar Era, and the Neoliberal Era. I came to this book , because I had read a bio on FRanz Boas during my studies of Northwest native cultures. It was interesting to learn in what ways science, politics, and education impacted anthropology and to see how the separate disciplines evolved. The bibliography is EXTENSIVE, so if you want to know more about any one social scientist or  a particular historical movement the biblio points in the right direction. Although scholarly, this book is not difficult to follow for the average reader that is interested in the subject. I highly recommend it if you are looking for an excellent overview of American anthropology.	2002-07-31

This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man,  we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling.  I need not worry.	2000-12-13

Each component of  diet, fats, proteins and carbs are discussed in enlightening ways. Did you  know that peanuts have a mold commonly growing on them known to be  carcinogenic? What are the benefits of soy? What's so bad about margarine,  in fact, Weil provides a fascinating history of margarine, that's sure to  open your eyes. He even gives a profile for the worst diet in the world.  Recipes are included that I found helpful especially in the dessert  section, because many of his desserts use olive oil. Probably part of the  reason I found Weil's advice so easy to swallow is because I like the  Mediteranean diet and I enjoy soy and fish and olive oil regularly.

A western, coming of age novel, a transformation from innocence to road-worn. One quality remains unchanged throughout this story of two young men that leave their home in Texas for adventures in Mexico, friendship.  McCarthy's Mexico is a vast other-world with it well described life styles  of the vaqueros and the breaking of wild horses. The prose is sparse and  haunting, prompting the reader to use their imagination. A refreshing  approach from the contemporary American way of reveal it all in the most  graphic and shocking detail. The story is intense and riveting, I couldn't  put it down. All the big themes are depicted here: friendship, maturation,  love, survival and family. It did remind me of Faulkner's work, in that,  the story unfolds in a series of almost orchestral movements. An important  author who should not be missed.	2000-07-26

Delilo's language and style is fresh. He did an excellent job creating the feeling of the modern, it's relationships and themes. And it  is a funny book in an absurd, pathetic way. The difficulty I had with the  story was with the characters. I couldn't seem to get into a Hitler  professor, an aging stair climber, know it all health concious kids, or the  &quot;white noise&quot; cloud surrounding their lives.

Earlier this year I read Seamus Heaney's excellent translation of Beowulf.  Grendel is a retelling of this epic poem from the monster's eyes, versus  the heros eyes. Darkly comic (laugh out loud), wildly surreal, a mixture of  childish pranks and philosophical dissertations into the meaning of life.  Gardner's prose is lyrical and finely wrought. Many stop-and-read-again  lines. This version shows the side of mankind lingering in the back of my  mind when I read Beowulf originally. The essence of man. Grendel stands  nicely alone, but is also a tremendous compliment to the traditional poem.   I se Grendel becoming a classic. Highly recommended.	2000-07-09

Barrett's descriptions of the crew's  experience in the Artic was outstanding evoking both place and mystery. The  cultural differences between the Eskimo and white men were realistically  wrought. All th emain charcters are haunted by longings as dramatic as the  artic landscape. The Voyage of the Narwhale is a wonderful weaving of  desire for self-aggrandizement that characterizes some men's hearts.  Justaposed by other men with a nobility to depict what's true at any cost.  Thankfully the book ends with hope and the healing of many past events and  relationships. In the end all power is taken away from Zeke, the  self-serving master of their first artic mission. It was a wonderful read  that kept me interested from beginning to end. Highly enjoyable, and one of  those books that sticks with you long after the pages have been closed.	2000-07-09

The second half of the book did not live up to the &quot;build up&quot;  of the first half. In the end , Lidie was a disappointment to me. She lost  her fine resolve and was pretty confused by life, or so it seemed to me.  The boy Frank dropped out way to early from the story and his demise simply  wasn't plausible based on the way in which his character was initially  drawn. The book didn't hold together well. It was full of ambiguity. It had  moments of greatness and then would drop back into a fit of inaness and  boring transgression.  I'm glad I read it; I learned a bit about  abolitionist history, but it left me feeling hollow.	2000-06-30

This book is a collaboration between the Dalai Lama and an Arizona state psychiatrist, Howard Cutler. I found the mixture of case studies and statistical refernces with Dalai Lama's thoughts to be distracting. I  constantly was looking to bypass the pschiatrist's imput and find the Dalai  Lama's thoughts. Probably I bought the wrong book and should have chosen a  title that was written by the Dalai Lama only. The Dalai Lama's focus on  compassion and tolerance and the trained mind for achieving happiness, I  found to be quite palatable. He teaches respect of  the common humanity  versus the religious label someone wears. As a Christian interested in  metaphysics, the Dalai Lama reveals buddhist teachings in ways that the  western mind can find attractive and inspirational.	2000-03-31

This book is very detailed and not for someone who doesn't understand what the Bolsheviks were rebelling against. Little  background is given on the Tsar's reign and the problems associated with  autocratic rule. The story is never presented from the Tsar's side.  What  the reader does receive is a detailed account of Lenin's private and  political life. Lenin was full of contradictions and paradoxes that were  reflected in Communism. It was almost as though his influence was so  powerful that the political culture reflected his egnimatic personality. In  addition to being a fine intellectual biography of the man, Ulam's text  details all the political movements that competed with Lenin in addition to  highlighting the beginnings of the Stalin era.<br />Ulam writes well and is  interesting to read. As a lay reader I found all the details sometimes  overwhelming, and I had to do additional research to understand the issues  that the Bolsheviks were responding to. As a non-scholar, I found this book  readable and memorable.	2000-03-26

Some readers found the author's convoluted  style exhilarating, I found it troublesome. Still Wharton's language is  beautiful, and he uses a variety of interesting techniques, but he switches  back and forth between time periods, characters and settings entirely too  quickly for my tastes. I recommend it for a challenging read that evokes  the haunting surreal qualities of a glacier.	1999-12-08

It is absolutely haunting in its ability to evoke mood and the mystery of place. The book is divided into three parts. Part one is narrated by Antionette. Part two is narrated  by Rochester and part three returns to Antionette, now mad Bertha who  inhabits the tower at Thornfield. This story gives you a look into madness  and suggests much more than organic causes for it. Highly recommended.	1999-11-24

Humbolt's Gift is a wonderful story about themes of individuality and creativity, American society in the 1940's and 50's, and about alienation. The characters are wild and eccentric. Charlie, Humbolt's hero, escapes the  dominations of society through personal transcedence, but can he really? I  ask. HG also brings up questions about how we are influenced by our  mentors, and that sometimes we must go beyond their influence to become  ourselves. I think the ending is a trick. You get the impression that  Bellow wants us to think transcedence is the way, but also he puts some  doubt in our minds about Charlie, can Charlie really transcend when he's  filled with so much love for his fellow man. An interesting, thought  provoking read.	1999-09-26

This story is a tribute to life and the comfort and fine comapnionship our animals give us. It's also a refreshing read on flyfishing. Monninger's tone is avidly unpretentious. I absolutely loved his flashback on his first  fishing experience as a young boy. Another scene that will remain in memory  was when he was lobtser fishing with Nellie off the coast of Maine. His  description of light, color and bouyancy is marvelous.<br />This is not a book  about cancer! In fact, I believe the publishers made an error on the  coverleaf of the book when they said she was diagnosed as having cancer.  Monninger did not want a diagnosis. Nellie is very much alive, and stays  that way.<br />Anyone who pays particular attention to their relationship with  animals will be deeply moved by this tremendous story. Home Waters is the  best story I've read in years, and to think I almost didn't buy it!	1999-08-29

Theroux engages everything and everyone with a sort of biting-embrace. He doesn't mince words. He tells the story of the Americas as he experiences it. It's not necessarily pretty and it isn't  always complimentary.Theroux's mixes observation with historical background  and literary references that add to the text. Theroux's power of  description can be breathtaking. &quot;Flocks of white herons blew across  the grass tips like flecks of paper in a breeze&quot; It is this type of  prose juxtaposed the poor living conditions of the people that adds allure  to the story. I think Theroux's writing rests on the edge of what people  find comfortable, but the reality is traveling to a third world country is  not COMFORTABLE. One must fine riches and beauty amongst the squalor.	1999-06-29

Joan Wulff's flyfishing book is the perfect beginning to a long relationship with flyfishing. My husband bought me this book in 1991, and I have referred to it ever since. It's refreshingly written from a women's  perspective. All the basics are here: casting, wading, flyrod selection and  line differences, clothing recommendations, understanding insects and the  various types of fish and flyfishing both fresh and salt water. You'll find  nothing pretentious in this book, even though it's written by the best  known female flyfisher worldwide. Trying flyfishing? You had better buy  this book! Reading it while you are learning will enhance your enjoyment  and understanding of the sport.	1999-05-30

The main character, Andre Louis is quite  an admirable intelligence with a grand flair for high adventure. We see him  as a lawyer, a great speaker, a master swordsman, and an actor playing  Scaramouche.The love angle is full of suspense, and behind the story lies a  great mystery as to Louis' parentage that keeps you guessing and wondering.  Highly recommended!	1999-03-10

I loved this book, not only for it's inside view into pre-French Revoltionary France and Naples but also for its rich portrait of friendship between a man, a woman and literally two kingdoms, France and Italy. Ample  biographical information is inserted between the letters helping us  understand the characters and their lives. In particular we follow Madame  D'Epinay and her role as a female in the Enlightenment. She had a brilliant  mind and a sensitive spirit, only held back by her frail body and the era  in which she wrote. The letters end with D'Epinay's death.  Galiani states  that we do not out survive our true friendships, something of us dies also.  During this twenty-five year correspondance we meet other important figures  such as Catherine The Great and the young Mozart and Voltaire. If you  appreciate the power of letters and their ability to reveal a life and you  are interested in the Enlightenment, this book is not to be missed.	1999-02-14

Moll's story is a romp, but sheds light on poverty and the difficulties of independent  living during a time when the world was truly controlled by men. Moll  Flanders shows the importance of survival over childrearing, and gives the  reader insight into daily eighteenth century life. I read it primarily to  get a look at the time period.	1999-02-08

I liked the author's voice, but found most of the characters to be unattractive.  Berendt's characters are eccentric, head strong and wildy outrageous, but for me, they lacked the  substance to make them interesting.  Whether rich or poor, all the  characters are truly self absorbed and therefore boring. Emma, the road  singer was the exception. She's an amazing soul who shares her gift of song  tirelessly. The murder thread didn't make this book more compelling. I  found myself losing interest. Somehow Savannah in all its self absorbtion  was both forgettable and unforgettable, and therein lies the ambiguity. The  book is provocative enough to warrant a look, so that you can decide for  yourself.	1998-11-30

Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul.  Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all  beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story.  Deceit,  greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel  soul which knows no compromise.  Romola, the book's main character is a  study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness.  Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and  savor.	1998-11-18

Terese Svoboda's Cannibal can best be described as haunting.Its terse prose is well written.   Cannibal tells the story of awoman's trek through Africa; following the man she loves. As their journey unravels she begins to suspect that he is not what he appears to be, and in fact he may be starving her.  The story is told from inside the woman's head.  It is all reflective dialogue; in this case it works, and keeps the reader's attention. If you are interested in Africa, and like dark psychological discourse in literature; then this book is for you.	1996-06-12
