Most of them are popular guitar standards from several generations and a variety of artists from several genres.  Music is transcribed using tableture and standard notation.  Songs are written using the real music (this is no &quot;fake&quot; book), you'll be learning the songs the way they're meant to be played.  If you're an accomplished musician, this is a good book for you.  If you're a novice, I'd stay way from this one for now...	2004-04-08

The book covers several in-depth subjects like the history of songwriting, how various type of songs came to be popular, loads of information about the use of musical theory, and various approaches to writing songs.  I'd recommend this book for any serious musician or novice songwriter.	2004-04-08

The book contains full-color photographs of all the current and previous military medals and ribbons (except the four or five most recent awards) along with a history, proper order of precedence, occasions for wear, and a full explanation of the proper wear of the attachments for each award broken down by each individual service.  <br />If you are an awards officer/clerk, then you will appreciate the full-color guide with each of these awards in order and guide for wear.  This book beats looking up the official instruction for your particular branch.  <br />If you are in the military, a veteran, or an awards officer/clerk in any of the four branches, Coast Guard or Merchant Marines, I'd recommend this book to you.	2004-04-08

This &quot;fake&quot; book has songs transcribed in standard notation and tableture, making it easy to read and learn quickly.  If you're a novice guitarist or just need to learn the general feel of a song in a hurry, this is a good book.  Even a beginner can pick this one up and start making recognizable sounds in no time.  However, if you want to learn the &quot;right&quot; way to play a song, I'd recommend a different book.  This one serves its purpose by giving you the ability to play simplified versions of popular song by using power chords, simplified riffs, etc.  A great book to use if you want to increase the number of songs in your play list in a short period of time.	2004-04-08

Although it doesn't go into any great detail, it does touch on a number of subjects.  Although I haven't taken the 70-290 exam yet, I did find more coverage of topics that are covered by the 70-291 exam, which were absent from those books.  The book also comes with a CD containing a MasterSim exam, which has over 200 questions.  I wouldn't use this for a stand-alone study guide, but I haven't found a book yet that could stand up to that challenge...  Summary:  brief and to the point.	2004-04-07

Infrastructure (Microsoft Press Training Kit)	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Don't rely on this one alone to pass the exam...	Having just taken the 70-291 exam, I can assure you that this is not a full and complete study guide for the real exam.  The book is made up of something around 1000 pages, however, for each lesson review, the full questions for each lesson are repeated in the answer section, padding the book's pages quite a bit.  Incompleteness in and of itself is not entirely bad, but I found the book to be often misleading and containing several errors.  The book is not without its merits, though.  The accompanying CD contains a trial version of the Server CD and the labs and exercises were very helpful.  The book on CD is also useful to have, especially when you want to study on the go and don't want to drag the book around with you.  Call-outs in the text point you to think about what's on the test, too.  However, if you're going to take the exam, make sure you don't rely on this book by itself.  It's pretty weak on security policies and SUS, both of which are tested on the exam.  If you arleady have study guides for this exam, this isn't a bad addition to your library, but it shouldn't be your only book to help you prepare for the exam.	2004-03-27

This book has great coverage of the key points of the exam.  The book is laid out in an easy-to-read fashion that calls attention to key points on the exam.  The accompanying CD is also a bonus, providing simulation labs, an electronic version of the book, and training videos.  Hundreds of images and screen shots make for easy reading.  The practice exam has questions that are similar to the questions you will find on the actual exam.  I'd call this a well-rounded study guide for the exam.  If you're planning to take the exam, you should have a copy of this book.  It's much more complete than the Microsoft Press book and isn't chock full of mistakes (like the Microsoft Press book is).	2004-03-27

If you have no experience in Arabic grammar (like me), but you're serious about learning to read and write the language (like I'm trying to do), this is a good supplement to your other learning materials.

The strong selling point of this package is the accompanying book.  With over 300 pages of text, the book itself is well worth the cost of this package.  It covers the material on the cassettes and has a section on the written language.	2003-08-15

True to its name, this book is a great guide for any current or future officer in the US Navy and does not stray from its intended purpose, which includes providing guidance on customs and courtesies, pay and allowances, duties and responsibilities, and other key subjects relevant to Naval officers.  I would give the book five stars if it was a bit thicker and more inclusive (like officer guides from other branches), but this guide is an excellent source of information on important subjects and provides references to other sources of information.	2002-07-18
