The latter characterizes Lackey's original works and is what largely drew me to her writing.<br />The former I recommend largely for Lackey fans or fantasy fans in need of &quot;mind-candy&quot;, the latter to everybody.<br />&quot;Exile's Honor&quot; falls into the former, light-weight category.  While it fills in some back-story holes nicely for Valdemar fans, the plot is lackluster (although it does pick up nicely in the last 20% of the book), with the &quot;good guys have little trouble&quot; sort of simplicity that has characterized recent Lackey writing with some notable exceptions such as &quot;Take a Thief&quot; or &quot;The Shadow of the Lion&quot; which fall solidly into my second category.<br />As such, I only recommend this volume to hardcore Valdemar fans.  Hopefully its recently published sequel, Exile's Valor, is more substantive.	2003-11-28

Those familiar with my reviews know that I don't lightly describe something as amazing.  This is easily the most captivating SF series I have read in years, and unlike many series, it does not peter out or become predictable in later volumes.<br />As you would expect of Donaldson's work, the real story is about the characters and their flaws and struggles -- he takes us deep into the well developed personalities of each major character, and how they persevere, or fail, despite their weaknesses.<br />The series is pretty cleanly wrapped up in this volume, with few unanswered questions left at the end.  If you've come this far in the series, of course you want to read this one too!	2003-11-13

It has a good, solid science fiction feel to it (not fantasy passing itself off as SF as is so common these days).  Donaldson focuses on the dark characters and inner turmoils of (mentally) damaged people (and they're all damaged in some way).  Well done, this feels like the beginning of a great new series.	2003-09-12

The combination of real-world cooking, detailed research, clear goals, and well designed recipes makes any of the series (or magazine) well worth seeking out.<br />In The Quick Recipe, the focus is on dishes that can be made from start to finish in 30-60 minutes.  My mouth was watering going through this book for the first time, you'd be amazed at what Cook's has managed to keep under the hour mark, without resorting to low quality short-cuts...

In &quot;Cowboy Feng's&quot;, Stephen Brust tries a variation on his usual fantasy subject areas, twisting towards science fiction, and succeeds admirably.  Although this is a stand-alone volume, it brings to mind Spider Robinson's &quot;Callahan's&quot; series.  Brust capitalizes on his strength in first-person narration, and keeps the reader guessing through this short volume.<br />A must for fans of Brust, this volume also works well for new-comers.

Often the cross-over result is lackluster.<br />So I was more than pleasantly surprised by this volume, which is quite different than Brust's other works.  And unlike many vampire novels, it is not clear at first that our protagonist is a vampire, nor do we linger on the gory details.  Since the writing is the first person perspective of the vampire, much is not spelled out because it is &quot;obvious&quot;.  In some prose, this might result in a confusing meander through a stream of consciousness, but in &quot;Agyar&quot;, this results in a smooth, flowing tale of the life of Jack Agyar.  It is a short, compelling read.<br />Highly recommended for both fans of vampire novels, and those who normally don't like them.	2003-06-04

It is also more gritty than many of her recent works and collaborations, harkening back to her gutsy early works.  Well done!<br />The length of the volume allows for significant character development and plot twists galore (and medieval Italian politics has nothing but plot twists!).  This also means the first 50-100 pages of the book kind of drags.  That's okay, work your way through that, and you'll be entranced.  I finished this sizable volume in less than 3 nights of reading...  That good, really.<br />The ending wraps up a little too neatly, quickly, and nicely, something of a Lackey trademark, but it's hard to complain about this meaty and interesting story.	2003-05-18

The narrative is choppy, and the reader never really gets into the protoganist's head the way we do in even his earliest works (&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;).  The progress of the plot is uneven, and unlike his many works set in Europe, we do not develop a vivid image of either Havana or the Florida keys.<br />If you are looking for an introduction to Hemingway, I strongly recommend reading one of his great works such as A Farewell to Arms or For Whom the Bell Tolls.  If you are working your way through all of Hemingway's works, then of course this belongs on your list.	2003-03-15

While it is interesting to hear from the views of others, including  that of a jhereg (the creature), some of the narrative is less compelling than in earlier books.<br />By all means, if you have gotten this far into the series, do read these.  I just personally found the narrative from multiple viewpoints less appealing than the single-point narrative in the earlier volumes.	2003-03-15

It is a fascinating work in that it is written from the unusual perspective of anthropomorphized cats and dogs (ie, they have human feelings and drives).  It is definitely not a book aimed at children, like many of those based on animal characters.  Some parts are even shockingly harsh, but the author captures the behaviors and style of actual cats and dogs very well.<br />I felt like there could have been a little more background, since the setting is left deliberately vague.  We never get an idea of scale, or how these cats and dogs ended up in acting like humans, living in cities, having a religion, and so forth.<br />A unique work, and well worth a look for that alone.	2003-02-25

There is a lot of perspective on what each main character or party was doing at the time of Rand's major actions at the end of book 9.  Not a whole lot &quot;new&quot; happens, but the stage is set for a lot of cool stuff down the road.  Much time is given to character development, and setting the scene for mood and attitude of the people of this land.<br />Having summarized, I must say that there are a lot of harsh reviews for this book, and I feel they are out of line.  If somebody has made it all the way to book 10 (6000-7000 pages in the first 9 volumes), they should be well familiar with Jordan's writing style.  Sure, he takes a lot of time to describe things.  That's exactly why his world is so lush and believable!  That's why people READ this series!  If you made it this far and prefer a terse Hemingway style of prose, man, you must be a glutton for punishment!<br />Not as much &quot;exciting&quot; happens in this volume, but we learn what is going on everywhere, and the scene is set for the actions of the next volume.  Yes, it could have been a little longer, okay, maybe a lot longer, but I would rather have had the volume as it is today, than waited another 6 months for it to grow more substantial.  And that (relatively short) is the only reason I give this volume 4 stars instead of 5.<br />If you've made it up to book 10 in this series, you would be really really silly to not read this one.	2003-02-10

I don't speak Vietnamese to rate the translations and phrasing used in this pocket-sized guide, but I have used a number of Lonely Planet phrasebooks for languages that I do know more about.  This guide follows the format of those other guides, broken down into sections by situation, with a 2-way dictionary at the back and a pronounciation guide at the beginning of the book.<br />Two notable omissions.  There is not a section on &quot;love and dating&quot; as there is in every other LP Phrasebook I've used.<br />Also, unlike the Russian phrasebook, which contains the english phrase, a phonetic pronounciation, and then the actual spelling, this book does not contain a phonetic spelling.  For a language likely to be as difficult as Vietnamese for native English speakers and considering that such speakers are the book's target audience, phonetic spellings (indicating inflection as well) would help a lot.<br />Still, a decent phrasebook as LP ones tend to be.	2002-12-28

If you are new to this world, start with &quot;Arrows of the Queen&quot; or the &quot;Last Herald-Mage&quot; series.<br />The story fills in the details of Herald Skif, and paints an interesting picture of the capital city of Haven (from Lackey's other writings, who would have thought it to be such a desparate, impoverished, and dangerous city?).  It also has a little more of the gritty character I found so appealing in the first two or three series of Lackey's Valdemar books.  A long-standing quibble of mine, the cover art, seems to have been addressed, the Companion pictured looks closer to what the text describes.<br />Quibbles -- it ends too quickly after a long build-up (it felt like it could have used a few more chapters), and things still go &quot;too well&quot;, too easily, for her main character, which has been a theme in recent Lackey books.  But it definitely feels more solid than the last two or three volumes.	2002-11-07

This is a relatively recent edition, and so I found it to be largely accurate, though (understandably) some prices and hours had changed.  Every phone number I tried was accurate, and the guide led me to some cheaper/better than the usual hotels.  Of course, the flip-side of that is that the cheaper/better hotels are more likely to be booked up because they are mentioned in LP.<br />There were a few bars or restaurants in Barcelona that had either changed names or closed (or I completely missed them) that were in the guide...  And if you are focusing on barcelona, maybe carry the LP Barcelona city guide also, since as the title would lead you to believe, the focus of the book is on the entire province, with only about 1/4 to 1/5 of this volume devoted to the city of Barcelona.<br />Recommended.	2002-10-06

However, the plot was obscure and not very well fleshed out.  But the biggest issue I had with the book was that it seemed very short.  Short chapters, large typeface, and especially a sudden and inconclusive end to the book.  It felt like a deadline was reached or an editor said &quot;ok, that's enough pages, end it there&quot;.  So, unlike the games, each of which has a conclusive ending, this book didn't really seem to end smoothly.	2002-06-11

However, as the action picks up, Bond's skills shine through.  The action, the tactics of manuevering military forces is where he is at his best.

I like Mercedes Lackey's<br />writing in general, particularly her older work, and she has chosen quite an interesting world/mythology to write in here, one she hasn't worked in before, to my knowledge.  But something is missing.  It might be that things unfold too neatly and easily for the good guys.  It might be that the characters aren't fleshed out very well.  It feels like the book should be longer and considering the setting (London early 1900s) and type of adversaries, it should be grittier.

Although the ending of &quot;Brightly Burning&quot; does harken back to the earlier Valdemar books.  However, this definitely suffers less from that softness than the last two volumes of the &quot;Owl&quot; series.<br />If you're a casual SF/Fantasy fan, &quot;Brightly Burning&quot; works fine as a stand-alone volume, although some of the references will seem obscure.  It's not a bad place to start, but I would strongly suggest starting your exploration of the world of Mercedes Lackey with &quot;Arrows of the Queen&quot;, &quot;Magic's Pawn&quot;, or &quot;Winds of Change&quot;.<br />Two suggestions to the author:  Try to decrease the &quot;perfect justice&quot;, the good guys being close to flawless, etc.  The other is to tighten up the cover art.  The companions look like a teenage girl's fantasy of a unicorn, not anything matching the descriptions in the prose.<br />All that being said and done, this is a good book and well worth buying.	2000-11-05

The plot is much thinner, the main characters act/think in ways inconsistent with their earlier development.  Lackey often has a bit of a moralistic tone (diversity is good, tolerance  is good, etc).  Nothing wrong with that, and it usually works well, but  here it comes across as preachy.<br />Until the last 50 pages of the book,  everything goes basically without hitch for Darian and friends -- where are  the conflicts and intensity of writing of &quot;The Last Herald  Mage&quot;??<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm a major fan of Mercedes Lackey, and  have read (and own!) just about every one of her works and collabarations.

However, the plot  has some weaknesses, the ending is a bit on the ludicrous side, and  Clancy's &quot;good guys&quot; seem to be saying that anybody who cares  about the environment is a complete nut and to be a &quot;good guy&quot;,  you've got to only want to exploit the environment.<br />Clancy -- you  should keep your politics out of your writing.  It's a lot more interesting  to read when you stick to what you know.	1998-08-23

If you are already familiar with Pern, I highly recommend this book, it fleshes out a lot of details missing from the other books.<br />-omar	1998-06-19

If you liek fantasy, if you liked any of the Dragonlance books, you *have to* get this book.  It answers a lot of questions about why things were the way they were in the Dragonlance Chronicles.  I wish it had been a little longer (another 100 pages so that Margaret could have gone into more detail on some things like Kitiara's adventure or Tanis' background), but it was well worth the money.	1998-04-13
