The truth is she had no natural feel for language -- there's no music to her prose, none at all, and all of the novels sound better when just the titles are read. But the idea of her as the female punk &quot;underground&quot; &quot;subversive&quot; and &quot;transgressive&quot; priestess is very tempting. I say this kind of in sorrow. &quot;Kathy Goes to Haiti&quot; is funny once in a while though. This one is a dreary bore.	2004-07-01

It's nice that the author doesn't much care for Andrea Dworkin, but she goes head over heels for Bret Easton Ellis and Kathy Acker, whose literary accomplishments I think have been hit and miss at best. The best thing in the book is the attention paid to David Cronenberg and J.G. Ballard, including interviews with each.	2004-07-01

He's the Seth Morgan of the Iowa Writers Workshop.  The definition of &quot;literistic&quot; is: nothing written from real experience, only faked to please the teachers of &quot;Creative&quot; Writing workshops.  The Queen of this sort of garbage is Joyce Carol Oates.  Ri-CHARD is giving it the good ole college try.  Sure he's got talent, but talent is cheap.  To cross genres here [and paraphrase Lester Bangs]: David Bowie had &quot;talent,&quot; he could write good &quot;songs,&quot; but did he ever write anything as good as &quot;Woolly Bully&quot;?  Did any of Bowie's songs need to be sung?  If I was a teacher I suppose I'd give Mark Richard an &quot;A&quot;, but I'd never spend money on any of his books.  [I did once.]  It's all written to see himself in the mirror [and in others' regard] as the Author riding the perceived zeitgeist of his time.  Not because any of it needed to be said.  I give him two stars instead of one because he's better than Bradford Morrow or Ted Mooney, but that really ain't saying too much.	2001-04-04
US	52494041	R16HCLZLX8JCT0	0786866527	474101056	Experience	Books	1	20	28	N	N	Unrevealing, dreary cash-in	Having read all of Martin Amis' novels -- some of which are not nearly so entertaining as advertised, but I've always held out hope -- naturally I was curious about this book, especially because vague rumors had reached me of his falling out with Julian Barnes and also because there'd been a hullabaloo in England over his changing agents and [? this part was a mystery] expensive dental work.  Well, &quot;Experience&quot; deals with none of this [other than the dental work, which is tedium unrelieved] except as may have been dictated by a publicist.  It's all extremely safe.  A little better than, but resembling a long, boring, repetitive interview with endless softball questions from Barbara Walters or Charlie Rose, without the interruptions.  Most of the book is really about his father, Kingsley Amis, and that's the most interesting material.  <br />Martin says nothing, for instance, about ANY of his romances, and essentially NOTHING about the terrible rift with his former best friend the novelist Julian Barnes.  <br />And, this may seem a tasteless objection, but Kingsley's death throes in hospital are really drawn out to extraordinary lengths.  100 pages?  I think so.  We suddenly become stalled in &quot;real time.&quot;<br />Another theme that grows very tiresome [not just tiresome, but VERY TIRESOME] is the recurring business of his cousin Lucy, who went missing at age 21 and then some 20 years later was found to have been one of the many victims of a British serial killer.  I think the better part of decency might have been to mention this once, definitively, then leave it alone.  After Martin Amis brings it up for the 10th [I'm not kidding] or 15th time, I really felt like I was being subjected to a ploy to disarm all criticism...  it was an uncomfortable, creepy feeling that ultimately made me wonder about Martin's sincerity.  It felt WRONG.<br />And the airing of his &quot;friendship&quot; with Saul Bellow likewise, in a different manner, struck me as crassly exploitive.  As if Martin Amis is saying, &quot;Because I'm his biggest fan -- and YOU'RE NOT [because you haven't met him and I have] -- some of the greatness rubs off...  Haven't you noticed, I'm DEEP.&quot;<br />Well, er, no, sorry, I think the jury is still out on that one.  And as far as Mr. Bellow goes, Martin is simply a FAN.<br />This book was sure to sell, and since part of the unmentioned subtext of Martin Amis' career is the fact that he dropped his lifelong agent to be represented by Andrew Wiley, the self-styled &quot;shark&quot; of literary agents [this is what started the big flap in the U.K.], I cannot help wondering if this book is not what is known as an &quot;agent-generated&quot; project.  Martin Amis got to write about his father, to pose as dutiful and loving son -- I'm sorry to use the word &quot;pose,&quot; but it rather fits when he's trying to make money off it -- fill in a dead spot in his career, and get on the record a few things evidently important to him...  such as his side to the somewhat predictable but by no means morally black and white dispute between Amis and his father's biographer.  [Amis quotes the Bible to buttress his case, but perhaps I'm overly dense: I didn't feel sure that I was getting all the facts.]<br />Buy Kingsley's &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; or &quot;The Russian Girl,&quot; or Martin's &quot;London Fields&quot; or &quot;Money&quot; instead.  <br />Martin Amis is not exactly disinterested here, you know; his own biographer, someday, will have to reconstruct some version of the truth.  I don't trust this book as far as I can throw it.	2001-02-20

This  Sonny Liston book -- who put Tosches up to writing this? It's too plainly  obvious that he knows zip about boxing, in fact I really wonder if he's  ever seen either of the Clay/Ali fights: Tosches just doesn't know what  he's talking about.  And there are Italian-Americans, mafioso or not, who  will tell you, in New York bars [where Tosches famously does a lot of his  &quot;research&quot;], that every big fight you've ever heard of has been  fixed and they know who fixed it and why -- it makes good gossip after  everyone's had a few drinks and it cannot be disproved.

There is enough violence to  keep one concerned, several fleshed-out characters, a sense of reality  throughout.

An American pilot  was shot down, kept prisoner until 1962.  The history recounted here starts  slowly, as perhaps a few too many Indonesian names are thrown at the reader  early on, but things clear up fairly soon, and the story really does become  quite gripping.  And this is history that has never before been revealed!   Some of the notes are worth pursuing in the back, also, by the way.	1999-12-25

But in at  least three directions Hesse has given me plenty to think about and purely  enjoy, and this book documents everything...  maybe it slights the drawings  a bit, but there's another book out there with nothing but drawings,  drawings galore.  The implications of what Hesse accomplished remain  &quot;mindblowing.&quot;  Anyone who has only heard about her or seen one  or two works needs to see what they've missed.	1999-11-24
