I was a bit concerned when I purchased this book -- it seems that lately Theodore Roosevelt is included in book just to increase its &quot;sale-ability&quot;. When TR receives attention at all, it is as a foil for the postmodern sensibilities of the author, who is usually a college professor. Well, Eric Rauchway is a college professor, and I am a sensitive, protective fan of TR, and I will submit that I found this book interesting, fun to read, and free of anti-TR bias. In fact, I learned an awful lot about the McKinley assassination (and assassin) that I had never encountered in the many TR biographies I have read. Besides being a fan of TR, I am a clinical psychologist, and I will attest that the author's foray into amateur forensic psychology is, overall, pretty commendable. Bully!	2004-05-07

Don't get me wrong, I really liked this Rumsfeld's War. The author obviously had the full cooperation of Don Rumsfeld in the writing of this book (including obtaining a classified threat analysis report, which is reproduced in the Appendix -- fascinating!). There are great anecdotes about Rummy that really give good insight into his personality, e.g. the fact that he still plays squash with the old &quot;hard&quot; balls, and on the court regularly bests men half his age. That said, if you could only purchase one book on Rumsfeld, I would recommend Jim Mann's &quot;Rise of the Vulcans&quot;, which is more comprehensive, reflective, and objective. I would say that &quot;Rumsfeld's War&quot; is for fans of Rummy, but &quot;Vulcans&quot; is for serious students of the War on Terror.	2004-05-07

Jim Mann has produced something truly remarkable -- a cogent and reflective assessment of contemporary personalities and still unfolding events. A group biography has not been so expertly researched and brilliantly written since Timberg's The Nightingale's Song\\" or Thomas/Issacson's \\"The Wise Men\\". Unlike the \\"quickie\\" books by Richard Clarke and Bob Woodward, Rise of the Vulcans will stand the test of time, and will likely be considered an essential text for this period of history. The author expertly weaves together the biographies and philosophies of Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Condi Rice, and Dick Armitage. He is even-handed and fair-minded throughout; if he has an agenda, he conceals it well. If I may presume to re-state the author's central thesis: the six public servants featured in this book share a common goal -- to promote the \\"strategic depth\\" of the United States, i.e. to lead the nation to a position of military superiority so overwhelming that no competitor will ever even begin to try to overtake them. That's putting it very simply, of course; suffice to say that this book provides intriguing glimpses into the grand strategy underlying the current maneuvers in the Middle East. The worst thing about this book? The Beavis and Butthead quality cartoons on the cover, and the dumb title. But if you buy any book about the Iraq imbroglio, start with this one.	2004-05-07

If all of my psychotherapy patients read this book at the start of therapy, I think that treatment would progress faster and go deeper. This is a perfect book for therapists to give to their patients, friends, and families, to promote understanding of just what goes on in the consulting room. One caveat (which Irv acknowledges himself): this book is about patients who are very high functioning. Serious mental illness, suicide, etc. are mentioned only in passing. Young clinicians who unthinkingly apply Dr. Yalom's advice not to use psychiatric diagnoses could find themselves in a lot of trouble when working with a less fortunate patient population.	2004-05-07

Having read over 20 biographies of TR over the years, I would have to say that this is the worst. The author utterly fails to assess TR in his &quot;context&quot;, though she claims that this is her intent. She judges TR based on modern, &quot;politically correct&quot; sensibilities, and, naturally, finds him wanting. This book is more appropriate as required reading in the Women's Studies department at Wellesley College than for a student of history or devotee of TR.	2004-03-22

I had bought it thinking that this is history that which I SHOULD know about - but I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest the time to learn about it. Well, as soon as I started reading SAVAGE PEACE I found myself entralled. Max Boot writes history with a narrative energy that is often all too wanting in contempory nonfiction. The author takes the time to paint a portrait of the men behind the history, their personal lives, professional careers, and their familial and professional relations with each other. This is extremely important because the American military was so small back then that the same people keep popping up again and again, first as a lieutenant, then a major, then a general. Did you know that Oliver Hazard Perry (Battle of Lake Erie) was the older brother of Matthew Perry (opening of Japan)? Or that John Pershing lost his wife and daughters to a fire at their home in the Presidio (San Francisco) and was grief-stricken at the time of the Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa? If you enjoy that kind of historical fact, you will love this book as much as I. (Why only 4 stars? Because the book skims a bit where I wish it would have gone deeper; it sacrifices profundity for comprehensiveness.)	2003-07-09

Well, I haven't read them all, but I have read quite a few, and I think John Keegan's brief life of Churchill is magnificent. Keegan's expertise on military history adds much to our understanding of Churchill. Through Keegan's lens, we see how Churchill's early experiences in Cuba, India, Sudan, and South Africa were truly formative, rather than mere adventures (and opportunities to earn money through journalism). Similarly, Keegan's explanation of the Gallipoli affair helped me understand for the first time why it brought Churchill such ignomy; conversely, my appreciation for Churchill rose even higher as Keegan clearly laid out how Churchill prepared the British fleet for war against the Kaiser. Keegan also shines light on a usually unremarked upon episode of Churchill's life: his months spent in the trenchs on the Western front during the Great War. I have read the (sadly uncompleted) Manchester and the Gilbert tomes, and I highly recommend this little volume as either an introduction to Churchill or as a tasty treat to those who already admire the great man. I ALSO RECOMMEND PURCHASING AN AUDIO CD OR CASSETTE OF CHURCHILL'S WARTIME SPEECHES (AVAILABLE HERE AT AMAZON).	2003-06-25

There is very little here that a true-blue Hillary-fan does not already know about her, or any relevations about her political philosophy that any savvy person has not already surmised. I suspect that Ms. Clinton did not produce this book as a means of increasing her political base, but rather as a means of increasing her bank account. You might have heard that this book was written by a committee of ghostwriters in just a few weeks; sadly, it often feels like it. I would suggest that if you want a taste of the real Hillary, you should read IT TAKES A VILLAGE, which, I believe, was actually written by her.	2003-06-18

Samantha Power takes an awful long time to sound a single note: American policy makers repeatedly fail the world because they have the power to intervene and prevent genocide in the dark regions of the globe but choose not to. Her plaint is not unlike listen to someone say, ad nauseum, \\"Somebody ought to DO something...\\" She only lightly attends to the issue of the limits of intervention, and to the ultimate causes of such events. In my mind, the greatest flaw in this book is that, to follow her thesis to its logical conclusion, America is morally culpable because it did not storm the Fulda Gap into Soviet Russia during the Cold War to end the Bolsheviks repression of their peoples. I have heard many people today saying that we should \\"go into Africa with guns blazing\\" to end the reign of the various kleptocrats of Caliban's kingdoms. Where does it end? Imperial overreach and collapse? Who shall fight the battles that Powers wishes us to fight? Shall we draft all men between 16 and 39 so that Ms. Powers can feel content that no ethnic minority on some Southeast Asian archipelago is getting the shaft? Ms. Powers reminds me of the multitude who self-righteously affix \\"Free Tibet\\" stickers to their bumpers, but never stop to consider that said Liberation would probably require trading Taipei and San Diego for Shanghai and Beijing in a thermonuclear exchange.	2003-06-03

Weigley has a sharp prose style, and he delves into areas of American military history that others either ignore or neglect. I found his take on the war of annihilation against the American Indians especially important, mostly because it is free of political sentimentality and simultaneously captures the human tragedy of the event. His account of the airwar against Germany and Japan is riveting and revealing. Weigley has a gift for making statistics come alive. A great and grand narrative.	2003-06-03

If you were assigned to read this book in school years ago, maybe you can't remember what all the fuss is about. At last count, 152 Amazon reviewers gave this book an average of 5 stars. It is undoubtably on the short list for \\"Books that Changed My Live\\" for countless people. I suggest that the real wisdom to be found in this book comes not on the first reading, but upon re-reading (luckily, the book is short and moves quickly, too). All of the self-help books out there, from Deepak Chopra to Stephen Covey to Dr. Phil, are mere twaddle compared to this book. There is more truth and wisdom in one sentence of Frankl than in many volumes of other books. Do yourself a favor and buy this book (and pass a copy on to a friend afterward). You will immediately see positive changes in your life.

Like other reviewers, I agree that if you own DSM-IV (burgundy cover), there is absolutely no reason for you to purchase the DSM-IV-TR (silver cover). Might as well wait for DSM-V (won't that be a treat). If you are not a mental health professional or graduate student, I can't imagine why you would want to own this book. It is essentially a compilation of symptom and behavior checklists that help clinicians make reliable diagnoses of mental disorders.<br />I would recommend strongly (for both professionals, students, and the lay public), DSM-IV Made Easy by James Morrison. Morrison's book makes the DSM come alive. He illustrates technical points well, and provides interesting case examples that make you think of people when you read the diagnosis, not just symptoms.	2003-06-03

As a graduate student in psychology, I suggest that the best way to learn APA style is to obtain a copy of a manuscript from a TA or your academic advisor. This book is ineptly organized and its own \\"style\\" is stultifying. The only saving grace is that it includes \\"pictures\\" of text formated in APA-style. A big complaint is that the Publication Manual pretends that the only kind of article written by psychologists involves presenting the results of an empirical investigation. Another is the unwieldy and illogical system of citation (especially of material found on the Web). Also, I would like for the publishers to at least acknowledge that what is actually published in professional journals often bears no resemblance to the format required for submission. Whatever you do, do not buy the APA Style Helper software.	2003-06-03

But it is fun to read (and doesn't take more than an afternoon or two, at that). The portrayal of Ravelstein/Allan Bloom was a delight -- the egoism, the hedonism, the materialism -- what fantastic contradictions in a man who helped foster a conservative revolution in the United States!

This is not made clear in the marketing for this book -- it is written expressly for clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals, and not for people who are living with narcissists or who suspect that narcissism might be the root of their troubles. (HINT: If you think you might be a narcissist, you probably aren't.) That said, this is a fun and entertaining read by a well-known name in the field. Dr. Lowen is a bit &quot;out there&quot; at times, he can get very Esalen all of a sudden, but generally this book has good theoretical foundations and will be of help to any clinician who is treating a narcissistic patient.	2003-04-29

It's not that (anything but). Rather it is a personal account of what it was like for one man, Anthony Swofford, to be a Marine in the early 90s. The account is not pretty, but mostly because Swofford is not -- he is a drunk from a bad family who seems to care more about dead Iraqi soldiers than his own comrades. Now, he apparently is trying to elbow his way into literary society by putting down the working class men in the Marines.<br />That said, it's still a good book. It reads quick, and you will be hard pressed to find a similar account. You can learn a lot about what it's like to be deployed and wait for battle. There are some good moments too, about the clash between civilian and military cultures.	2003-04-29

It IS, however, a remarkable and engaging account of Reagan's determined battle with Communism, and his ultimate triumph over it. The author makes inspired use of declassified files from the KGB and Kremlin, and enough citations to prove he is a serious historian and not a revisionist hack. The facts presented in this book are powerful enough to change your perception of world history, 1968 to 1989. I recommend this book to any fan of Ronald Reagan; to anyone with more than a passing interest in Soviet-U.S. history; and, to those who doubt that an individual human being can, despite all odds, change the world for the better.	2003-02-18

It is a discredit to those heroes that so few Americans have even an inkling about the horrors of the Bataan Death March and the prisoner of war camps of the Imperial Japanese Army. GHOST SOLDIERS is a first-rate account of the deprivation, brutality, and starvation which killed so many Allied soliders and sailors. The authors allows the survivors to \\"bear witness\\" much like the survivors of the Nazi death camps do so compellingly in other books.<br />But GHOST SOLDIERS is never slow or tedious or maudlin or sentimental. The pacing is double-quick and the whole book has a cinematic quality to it. It would make a fine movie (an all-American \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\"). WWII and history buffs will devour the book quickly, but others should not be dissuaded, simply because GHOST SOLDIERS is \\"military history.\\" It is much more than that. It is a story of human beings enduring the unendurable, and of making enormous sacrifices for the sake of their fellows. The historical context, geography of the Philippines, and the military tactics are all expertly and unobstrusively explained. Readers not familiar with military jargon or tactics will not find themselves lost, but rather rooting for the brave rescuers as they advance stealthily to liberate the walking skeletons of Cabanatuan.	2003-02-01

I must disagree because in the end, the medium of film cannot help but to be stirring; film is by its very nature is \\"sensational.\\" The personal memoir is a much more effective means of transmitting the experience of combat -- the confusion, horror, terror, and sheer filth of it all. WITH THE OLD BREED is unique in that it is a personal memoir written a (very intelligent and introspective) enlisted Marine. There a multitudinous memoirs by officers, and they can't help but have a \\"gung ho\\" flavor to them. WITH THE OLD BREED avoids all that, and focuses on the sheer physicality and brutality of war.<br />I cannot recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who wants to know what battle is really like, and why we should think long and hard before sending our sons off to kill or be killed.	2003-01-11

Readers who purchase this book because they enjoyed the movie of the same name might find it challenging to determine just how the two works are connected (besides both being set in New York, and both involving gangs). It is more accurate to say that the Martin Scorcese film was &quot;inspired by people and events&quot; portrayed in this book. The book itself lacks the unifying narrative thread of the movie; it rushes and swerves frantically among countless colorful vignettes and covers many decades in the history of the New York City underworld. The book is a superb example of journalism from the 1910s and 1920s, i.e. fast and loose with the facts and interested primarily in generating a &quot;sensation.&quot; However, to modern readers this style may prove frustrating, even distracting. I think that this book will remain far more interesting to historians of journalism than to fans of the DiCaprio movie.	2002-12-17

If you happen to dislike Ike as much as Wicker does, then you might derive some sadistic satisfaction from reading this partisan screed.

He ignores the peace and unprecedented and widespread prosperity that marked the Eisenhower Administrations. He appears unaware of recently declassified Soviet documents that credit Eisenhower with averting nuclear war (on several occasions). He attempts weakly to blame Eisenhower for the Vietnam War, and to absolve JFK of any complicity. He manages to interpret ordering the 101st Airborne Division to enforce de-segregation as \\"doing next to nothing\\" to support Civil Rights.<br />Wicker has nothing but contempt for Eisenhower, and his prejudice is plain and wearisome. Wicker is a snob and he indulges in silly elitism: Ike was a bad President because he enjoyed Western novels and golf; and, because he didn't like Picasso. Years ago, Wicker wrote a biography of Nixon, called ONE OF US. His thesis was that Nixon was destroyed by a self-loathing American middle class who recognized him as one of their own. Because Nixon was not a patrician, he was not fit to rule. If you buy that claptrap, you might like this book.<br />Mr. Wicker is certainly fortunate that Stephen Ambrose is no longer alive. Mr. Ambrose, who wrote the definitive biography of Eisenhower, would have flayed Wicker publicly for this careless and mean-spirited drivel. Readers would do well to pass this book over and instead read Ambrose's abridged one-volume life of Eisenhower. Ambrose's thesis is that Eisenhower was \\"a great and good man\\"(and one of America's finest Presidents) and he provides abundant evidence to support that claim.	2002-12-05

If you enjoyed the HBO miniseries, you need to purchase and read the book BAND OF BROTHERS. It is my personal favorite of Stephen Ambrose's works -- more personal and intimate than D-DAY: THE SIXTH OF JUNE and more physical, energetic, and gripping than CITIZEN SOLDIERS. <br />Two things make this book unique in war literature: 1) the emphasis on pre-combat training and the development of a unit's esprit de corps; and, 2) the attention paid to the postwar lives of the men who served. <br />As always, Ambrose's machine gun prose seizes your imagination with perfect historical details. Another historian might tell you that training was tough, only Ambrose knows that American paratroopers were more fit than the professional football players and prize fighters of their day (and that the athletes often served as physical training instructors for the troopers!). Another historian might tell you that the company commander survived the war and led a prosperous, peaceful life; only Ambrose lets you know that the same man raises geese but would never think of slaughtering them for food.<br />Stephen Ambrose made a unique contribution to the profession of history and to the United States of America because he was able, more than any other researcher, to elicit from the heroes of World War II the complete and candid accounts of their actions.<br />If you already have read BAND OF BROTHERS, I suggest than you turn next to Ambrose's PEGASUS BRIDGE, which recounts the daring and critical glider raid by British commandos the night before D-Day. <br />Another, little known book that any reader of BAND OF BROTHERS will treasure is WITH THE OLD BREED: ON PELELIU AND OKINAWA by Eugene Sledge. Sledge served with the Marines in the Pacific and endured some of the worst combat in the history of the world. He survived to write a compelling and unforgettable memoir.	2002-11-13

The author's principle assertion is that Bonaparte's life and career served as the model for modern totalitarians such as Hitler and Stalin. The tone of this short book will be troubling to afficionados of Bonaparte, particularly because Paul Johnson is a \\"one-armed historian\\": you will never catch him saying, \\"On the other hand...\\". Every act, word, and associate of Bonaparte is treated with scorn and contempt by Johnson, who clearly despises his subject (and perhaps also those who still worship the Emperor?).<br />Now that you have been warned about the author's prejudices, I must say that this is a fun little book that deftly traces the life and career of Bonaparte, from Corsica, to the \\"whiff of grapeshot,\\" to Egypt, Moscow, and St. Helena. Anyone who enjoys reading history but only vaguely recalls the facts of Bonaparte's life will benefit from reading this slim volume. Johnson writes with marvelous clarity and his arguments are forceful and enthusiastic, if not always convincing.<br />The terrible thing about this book (about the Penguin Lives series altogether) is the ridiculous overpricing. This is why the book gets only 3 stars from me: [price] for what is essentially a very long magazine article is not worth the money. I don't know why Penguin doesn't issue these little geegaws as paperbacks; I think more people would read them if the price was reduced.	2002-10-25

Mr. Pollack offers a brilliant and concise account of US-Iraq relations, the history of Saddam's regime, and the nature of the threat that regime poses for the entire world. He provides a wealth of information regarding Saddam's mechanisms of repression, his designs on the region, and his current WMD capabilities. This information is neglected by most commentators on the Iraq debate, although it is all available through open sources. (BTW Mr. Pollack makes no effort to conceal his past employment with the CIA and no ideological tilt is discernible in his argument.) <br />If I may presume to summarize Mr. Pollack's argument: Facing down Saddam now and rooting out his repressive regime will be unpleasant and difficult. Ignoring the threat and waiting one or two years until Saddam has nuclear weapons will be catastrophic. The \\"moderate\\" Arab states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, etc. have notified the United States that if a strike against Saddam is to occur, it must happen quickly, because the people of these nations will not tolerate much longer an American military presence in the region. Therefore, in order to \\"withdraw in good order\\" it is necessary to eliminate the Saddamist regime first, lest the Republican Guard fill the vacuum created by the American retreat.	2002-10-14

TR's 1913-1914 expedition down the River of Doubt (subsequently renamed Rio Teodoro in his honor, and later Rio Roosevelt) is an astonishing piece of history - one often refered to in passing by other TR biographers, but not often fully explored, as it here. Author Ornig tells an exciting tale well, from the multitudious details of planning and executing a massive exploring expedition in the early 20th century, to vivid portraits of the characters involved. This book would be a wonderful companion for any adventure traveller (or even armchair adventurers).<br />Best of all, Ornig is no run-of-the-mill TR hagiographer (and there are plenty of them out there), nor is he interested in taking unfair potshots at the great man (plenty of those folks out there, too). Ornig simply relates events as they occured, and doesn't care a whit whether they cast TR in a favorable or unfavorable light: TR was a poor shot (due to his poor eyesight) and became grumpy and embarassed when he missed easy targets. TR was delighted with the impact on his waistline when the expedition was forced to subsist on reduced rations -- and argued against the restoration of full rations even though others were suffering. Do these facts detract from the TR legend, or add to it? I have never been a fan of Marble Men, and found that I loved TR even more after glimpsing some of his human flaws in MY LAST CHANCE TO BE A BOY. No student of TR should be without this volume.	2002-08-19

Professor Thornton leads us through the labyrinth of foreign policy decision making during the Nixon Administration and the subsequent Kissinger \\"Shogunate.\\" The reader must be prepared to think *strategically*, i.e. to consider apparently isolated events in a larger, global context. In other words, Thornton challenges us to think about world affairs just like the actual players did (and do).<br />Caveat: this is not a right-wing conspiracy-type book. It is a serious text on recent American and world history. People looking for a sensational ride through the subterranean passages of governmental power would probably be better off elsewhere. <br />Thornton does suggest explanatory models that are quasi-revolutionary, e.g. that Nixon's fall was the result of a commonplace political entrapment scheme by Kissinger, which led directly to (among other events) the fall of South Vietnam. Does that morsel sound tempting to you? The book is full of them. (I especially love Dr. Thornton's description of Watergate burglar G. Gordon Liddy - look up Liddy's name in the index to find the passage.)<br />Dr. Thornton is a Professor at George Washington University's School of International Affairs. He is an expert on China and its history (and he speaks several Chinese dialects). He is the \\"real McCoy\\" with a pedigree that includes a career in U.S. Air Force intelligence.	2002-08-04

I am a graduate student getting my Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. I also work for a company that designs, administers, and interprets personality-based pre-employment tests for use by corporations. I can say, without reservation, that Dr. Hoffman's book is full of misinformation that will not only not help you, but could also hurt your chances at gaining employment.<br />Dr. Hoffman's premise is that these type of tests are designed to prevent you from getting the job you want. This is not true. The tests do two things (and they do them quite well): 1) identify people who have been problem employees in the past; and 2) compare candidates' basic personality traits with the requirements for success on the job.<br />1. The basic premise of the the \\"Honesty\\" or \\"Integrity\\" test is that candidates who will end up stealing from their employer have stolen from their employers in the past. Dishonest candidates get \\"caught\\" by the tests because they figure that \\"since everyone is dishonest, it is stupid to portray yourself as *squeaky clean* and so they admit to these past thefts. Dishonest candidates steal *a lot* more than the average person who has had an occassional moral lapse. Identifying the difference between serious criminals and average people is what these tests do. If you are not a crook, you have nothing to fear from these tests. If you *are* a crook, I think that it is unethical for Dr. Hoffman to abet your criminal activities.<br />Unfortunately for the honest candidate, Dr. Hoffman does not make it clear that these tests also contain Lie Scales that will catch any attempt to portray yourself as \\"squeaky clean.\\" Employers know that not everyone is completely honest, and responding to the survey as if you were will probably get your application flagged.<br />2. I do not understand why Dr. Hoffman would suggest to anyone that they misrepresent themselves on tests of basic personality. All you will get is an offer for a job that will not match your personality, that will make you miserable, and at which you will eventually fail. <br />Think about it: You decide to apply for a sales job, even though you are an Introvert and do not enjoy meeting new people. You read Hoffman's book and learn how to misrepresent yourself as an Extrovert on a pre-employment test. You fake your way through the interview and get the job. Now what? You've just put yourself in a position where you have to \\"fake it\\" Monday through Friday, from 9 to 5. If you had represented yourself honestly, it is possible that you would have received a job offer for an administrative position, i.e. one that better matched your natural style - and one in which you would be happier and more successful.<br />When you are conducting a job search, the question you should ask yourself is, \\"Is this the right job for me, i.e. does this job match my talents, skills, and temperament?\\" By looking at these tests as just another way of answering that question, you can relieve a lot of anxiety you might have about completing these tests. You do not need to waste your money on this rather insubstantial book.	2002-08-04

Dr. Glassner provides a unique perspective on the American experience in Vietnam -- that of a medical officer responsible for treating the shattered, burned, and exhausted men caught up in that conflict. There is plenty of heroism in his short tales, but usually it is the heroism of brute survival, of adapting to impossible conditions, of enduring the unendurable.<br />I have heard this book referred to as an \\"anti-war\\" work, and one that derides America's involvement in Southeast Asia. I disagree. Glassner simply tells it like it was -- he pulls no punches, so oftentimes reading this book is very unpleasant: how many \\"John Wayne shoot 'em up\\" memoirs of Vietnam recount the suffering endured on a burn ward? <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Vietnam War, the continued psychological and physical suffering of combat vets from all eras, or to anyone concerned with the consequences for our sons and daughters when politicans send our troops to war.

And if you watch a movie version, read the book first. The old black and white film version cast with British kids is a million times better than the more recent color version with American kids -- probably because American kids are *already* savage...they have no civilized habits to lose! :-)<br />There is an incredible scene in the book where some older boys toss rocks at a younger boy who is playing in the water. The author notes the the older boys are careful not to throw the rocks too close to the younger boy: I believe he calls the protective perimeter thus formed the circle of civilization or something. Anyway, it's a great and important passage; look for it. It foreshadows all the madness to follow.<br />Here's a suggestion for a term paper (it worked for me): The character named &quot;Piggy&quot; wears spectacles that he fastidiously cares for when the boys are first marrooned; however, the spectacles are slowly demolished step by step as the boys descend into savagery. By examining the condition of Piggy's spectacles, you can judge how bad things have gotten on the island.	2002-08-03

I can't imagine a literate teenager who would not enjoy this book. Salinger perfectly captures the adolescent worldview: most people are \\"phonies\\"; the world is more twisted and sick than our parents and teachers would have us believe; and, the prospect of sex is altogether pervasive, exciting, and scary. Holden Caulfield, the book's protagonist, relates an adventure that is no less compelling because it is realistic. Who wouldn't want to escape into the underside of New York City for a week or so after being tossed out of prep school? Be careful of your peers who take this book too seriously, though: Mark David Chapman, after he shot and killed John Lennon, pulled \\"CATCHER\\" out of his pocket and calmly sat reading it while he waited for the police to arrive.

I actually take issue with the label of &quot;techno-thriller&quot;: MONKEY HANDLERS is about the men of the Navy SEALs, more particularly about how the human mind, body, and spirit can combine to produce results previously unimagined.

This is an excellent morality tale about parents who push their children to succeed in order to feed their own ambitions. Mr. Bunting seems to share my disapproval of the post-graduate year, and for the same reason: a single year spent at a boarding school is insufficent to transform a callow youth into someone the school can be proud to call one of their own. The first year at a superior school is jarring indeed, but these schools eventually teach their charges to handle pressure with grace...to find the sweet spot, as it were. <br />As has been said before, the dark, dirty secret of New England (and mid-Atlantic) boarding schools is that their expertise lies in turning the mediocre sons and daughters of the rich into persons who can pass muster in any boardroom or ballroom. They do not exist to make brilliant students more so, or even to boost students' chances at gaining admission to popular colleges.<br />This is a fine book and I recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in boarding schools or the college admission tumult. Those with an interest in education simply must read Mr. Bunting's AN EDUCATION FOR OUR TIME -- it is an absolute delight. Mr. Bunting is also the author of THE LIONHEADS, a highly original, brisk, and informed novel of the war in Vietnam.	2002-08-01

The book itself is a little pricey for what you get, however (I hope a paperback edition of this American Presidents series is made available eventually), and it is pretty evident to the informed reader that Auchincloss is merely reviewing the conclusions of previous biographers. Auchincloss does attend to a particularly interesting period of TR's life, i.e. his decline and fall. From TR's impulsive public declaration not to seek a \\"third\\" term, the bloodletting in Africa, his quixotic Bull Moose campaign, the misadventure in the Amazon, to TR's death shortly following the death of his youngest son in WWI (\\"poor Quinnikins\\"), Auchincloss's volume was for me a tantalizing foreshadowing of what is certain to be a grand event in biography -- the third volume of Edmund Morris's TR trilogy. This book should help keep you satisfied (if only for a few hours) until the release of Morris' next volume. And after you read Auchincloss's TR, you should read his THE RECTOR OF JUSTIN if you've never done so, and also Edward Renehan's THE LAST LION (excellent mini-biographies of TR's sons, fascinating characters in their own right).	2002-07-28

And if it is the best thing Ellroy has written, that means it is among the top American works of fiction in the past fifty years.<br />Ellroy creates a truly memorable cast of characters, including the unforgettable Kemper Boyd - Kennedy family insider aspirant - and Pete Bondurant - rock-hard extortionist, bag-man, killer - and he sets them loose in a wonderland of early 1960s American mayhem: J. Edgar Hoover's diabolic machinations; the Bay of Pigs; the apex of Mafia power. And all the events, all the characters, roar ceaselessly if unconsciously toward a singular end - the assassination of JFK.<br />Fantastic book. Strongly recommended.	2002-07-09

Hold on to your hats.	Whoa! Don't be fooled by the &quot;parody&quot; label: this is a profound and expertly crafted book. The casual reader should not overlook the subtle hidden messages of this volume. I found that the themes and symbols of the work did not become clear until I had re-read the book several times, and purchased additional copies as gifts for my friends and acquaintances. The anagrams, palindromes, and crytograms scattered willy-milly throughout the text are worth the price of admission. Some of the wordplay is so obscure that James Joyce or Lewis Carroll would weep (with pleasure!). A truly great mind and potent personality is tantalizing us behind the nom de brilliance, &quot;Stilton Jarlsberg.&quot; Expect great things from this volume...the author is truly a Master of Life.	2000-09-22
