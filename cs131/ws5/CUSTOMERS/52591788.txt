Miller's eloquent discription of the sights and feelings of greece will wet your appetite. it is also fun to visit the locations on the web as miller visits them in person.       miller is always worth the read and \\"colossus\\" is no exception.	2005-04-01

There is no moral. chichikov has no redeeming qualities. russian society is painted as lazy, drunk, and corrupt--not necessarily in that order. but gogol never finished the book leaving it meaningless. what is his message to russian society? who are the good characters and who are the bad? the most interesting character is kostanzhoglo whom we meet in part 2. he is hard working, intelligent and successful. he helps chichikov buy an estate, but we never know what happens as that part of the book is missing. the inference is that chichikov used him as he did everybody else.<br />what we end up with is a self centered antihero who uses everybody to satisfy his greed. his corruption is insatiable, but we never learn of his denouement.<br />gogol worked on this book and a sequel (which he repeatedly destroyed) for much of his life. he clearly had difficulty bringing any meaning to the story and must have also felt unfulfilled by it. It was an interesting premise that lead him nowhere.<br />there are too many great russian novelists to waste your time on this book. if you want a flavor of gogol, try his short stories.	2004-05-24

The Corrected Text	Books	5	12	16	N	N	WOW! where to begin?	faulkner is an acquired taste. like brussel sprouts, you either like him or hate him, but he is definitely good food for the brain. his books are by no means easy reads, but they are a must for any true lover of literature.<br />absalom, absalom could have been a simplistic story of the sutpin family from thomas, the father, birth to the death of his youngest child henry. it could have been told in chronological order by an omniscient narrator that provided all of the usual insights and motives into every act. but it is not!<br />Faulkner tells the story through the eyes of 4 people, all of a different generation or background. the story is told somewhat haphazardly with many gaps which are not filled in until later in the book. the facts are viewed through the eyes of the different story tellers with parts further filtered through stories told to them by others. all of this makes an engrossing tale all the more fascinating. at the end we have a picture of the family that is part history and part saga. <br />this unusual approach to story telling is classic faulkner. you need to admire the style to really appreciate the ingenuity of the author.<br />the story is better understood by reading the biblical reference of king david's son as well as faulkner's sound and the fury which involves two of the same characters--specifically quentin compson. <br />this is faulkner's best novel. it is not for the first time faulkner reader. you need to work your way up to this one by reading as i lay dying, light in august, and then sound and the fury. the trip through these books will challenge even the best reader, but the rewards are well worth it. you will truly never read someone like faulkner again.	2004-04-27

Light in August is no exception. It is a truly remarkable story. The 4 stars simply differentiate the best from the very best. Although this book is not as complicated as As I Lay Dying or The Sound and the Fury, it contains many of the same ingenious qualities regarding point of view and time.<br />The real difference here is that in those books, Faulkner was concerned with the consciousness of the individual characters themselves while here we are dealing with the relationship of the consciousness with the external forces of nature/nurture and the outside world.<br />This is a story about racism in the south. Although the story line itself covers only a few days, the book refers back two generations. Each of the main characters, Christmas, Hightower, and Burden are dominated by racism in different ways. It is racism and their reaction to it that brings them to their ultimate end. Most of the other characters and the town itself are also driven by the same demon. It boils down to the simplicity of white is good while black is evil with the shades in between being a transition from one to the other. When Christmas puts on the black boots of a negro, his transition from white to black is complete and he is then prepared to accept his fate.<br />The only character untouched by racism is the unwed and pregnant Lena. Interestingly the white father of her child who runs to escape his responsibility is called Brown(the one truly unlikable character in the book). Lena literally strolls into  town and the story at the beginning and strolls out at the end, untouched by the happenings. Her ignorance of her personal moral shortcomings also insulate her from the moral shortcomings of a racist society.<br />Does this storyline make this novel outdated today? Absolutely not. It may be even more true today than then. Today people's reaction to racism or perceived racism is driven more by outside influences than internal feelings or experiences and those who ignore those influences are like Lena and go on with their lives not to be dominated by it.<br />Faulkner is one of the truly great American writers. I ignored him for 50 years and have now read 4 of his novels in the last 2 years. I've enjoyed them all.	2003-09-24

US	52591788	ROHZGT60G478H	0876855575	954748344	Ham On Rye	Books	1	9	38	N	N	one lousy sandwich	this was my first charles bukowski book and it is unlikely i will go back for seconds. the writing is unimaginative and there is no character developement whatsoever. the main character, henry chinaski, has no redeeming qualities. his childhood is not that much different from most except for the severity of his acne problem. his response to that childhood is chronic violence and alchoholism. he literally becomes what he detests and is even worse. if this is supposed to be a coming of age novel like catcher in the rye, it falls miserably short. holden caulfield is searching for something and has positive intentions. chinaski has none of this....	2003-07-08

US	52591788	R2QOGU9G1EGX0G	0684839741	635285578	Good As Gold	Books	3	5	8	N	N	good, but not gold	i once read an interview of joseph heller in which he stated he came up with the idea for novels by coming up with an opening sentence. assuming that to be true here, this is a novel about the jewish experience. when we view this book from that perspective, we have a better appreciation of it. we have gold, who is out trying to write a book about the jewish experience,  continually rejecting his jewish heritage. it is not until the end when he finally embraces it. <BR>the political humor is exaggerated and doesn't work as well as it did in catch 22 where the setting of war makes the absurd normal. his family life is archie bunker/michael like except for the very touching lunch between gold and his older brother sid.  this conversation brought the family into focus. <BR>other characters like liebowicz and his fiancee's father border on the ridiculous and don't add a lot to the story.<BR>this is not vintage heller. suggest your reread catch 22 instead.	2003-04-24
