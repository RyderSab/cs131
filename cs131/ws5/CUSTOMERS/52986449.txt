The author visited the national puzzle tournament one year as a reporter; another year as a contestant. In between he interviewed Will Shortz at his home, but we get only a few lines from that interview; and he interviewed other constructors and contestants, but we get very little of them, either. We mostly get, at great length, quite uninteresting accounts of Romano's own life and problems, or, when he's interviewing some potentially interesting person, we get Romano's feelings about that person and reactions to what that person says or looks like. Even if you, like me, are a crossword fan, this book is not worth your money.	2005-08-14

Besides being an exciting story told well, this book should be interesting to all SF fans because it was the first real example of what we now call \\"Military SF.\\" It predated Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" by several years. Jerry Pournelle was strongly influenced by reading this and other Beam Piper works. (I think it is no coincidence that a minor character in this book is named Col. Falkenberg!) <br /> <br />So many aspects of this book are repeated again and again in works by Pournelle, Weber, Drake, etc.: The story is told from the point of view of a dedicated military officer. Military hardware and methods are presented in convincing detail. Military rites and customs, the implicit trust and comradeship between military people, and the natural distrust between military and civilian authorities -- all are implicit to the plot. Military ways of thinking are forever contrasted to their civilian counterparts, so that the civvy ways of thought are shown to be hopelessly fuzzy-minded and soft-hearted, incapable of handling a crisis. Sexuality is repressed to the Boy-Scout level -- well, perhaps that's because it was published in the 1950s. <br /> <br />And above all, aliens are gorily slaughtered in numbers. Much of the fun and the punch to this narrative lies in the fact that it's OKAY to wreak bloody mayhem on enemies, if they are nonhuman and attacked you first. John Ringo is a recent author who uses exactly the same method to add \\"kick\\" to a narrative. Ringo's books seem always to be asking, how inventively can we waste a battalion of lizard-headed gooks? <br /> <br />Piper showed how to ask and answer that question first, here in ULLER, where you will find the original pattern for the plot styles of Ringo, Weber, Drake, et al.	2005-03-25

Parts of this old book are superb--gripping--make you reach the end of a chapter and sit staring at the wall musing on what you just read and saying very quietly, \\"wow...\\"<br /><br />It isn't all like that, alas; if it were, this would be one of the great classics of the SF genre. The superb parts are the middle, when Russ gets her narrative rolling and tells a straight story. The goodness begins with a portrayal of a bright, rebellious teen in the 1950s as she explodes out of her conventional life. It continues as the grown Irene, now an agent for the shadowy Trans-temporal authority, explores the iniquitous depths of Ka'abah, a colony world that is attempting to recreate a society based on a fantasy of the Arabian Nights, and in the process recreating the worst possibly kind of subjugation of the female spirit. Irene finally cannot stomach what she is seeing and determines to rescue one bright 12-year-old girl before her soul is completely crushed. But Irene's partner objects, and things begin to go wrong. Is he patronizing her in a way that is more subtle but just as demeaning, as the Ka'abah men patronize their women?<br /><br />The problems with the book are the bread on this jammy sandwich. The opening chapter is mannered, self-conscious, distanced in a style of narrative that was just so trendy in the seventies and which is now just plain labored and irritating. It takes grit to wade through this now; I actually wondered why the book was still on my shelves and almost gave up rereading it.<br /><br />The other slice of bread is the ending. The author intrudes herself here, and not in a clever or cute or insightful way, but in a way that I read today as simply a cop-out. She got to a certain point in the story where her characters were at complete loggerheads with each other and with the world she had designed for them. There was no clear way forward; to get them to any kind of resolution would take tens of thousands more words; so she threw up a firework of style tricks and ducked out behind a puff of smoke.<br /><br />Still, the middle is just so darn good it redeems the frame. Oh! There's a fair amount of sex here. A lot of sex for 1978, and still today well beyond a PG-13.	2005-03-11

One strong hint would be that people are willing--even happy--to pay good money for a reprint of your old emails. On that criterion, and based on the cheerful other reviews, Larry Niven is really, really famous.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; on my shelves are 22 books with Niven's name on the spine. But this one is a shoddy collection of castoffs, cobbled together not (I hope) by Niven himself, but by some marketing droid desperate to have some more Niven \\"product\\" to sell. It contains four actual stories totalling 100pp; the rest is trivial filler, including the above-mentioned printout of emails.<br /><br />Those might be of interest to a PhD candidate in English writing a thesis on\\"Collaborative Methods In Science Fiction of the 1990s\\" -- but they are really for the wanna-be SF writer who wants to fantasize that he or she is among the lucky handful who actually get to collaborate with Larry Niven. In fact the emails are no more interesting than email between you and your co-workers. There's no writerly advice from Larry to his pals, no \\"here's the golden secret of good plotting.\\" You could read a megabyte of such email and be not one adverb closer to publication of your work.<br /><br />The rest of the trivia includes brief, uninteresting excerpts from novels; old, short, and dated essays; a report on a trip to an SF Con; a brief intro to someone else's book; and fragments of the \\"canon\\" (i.e. notes) on the milieu of the Man-Kzin Wars.<br /><br />This stuff is just sweepings from the writer's office floor. They show you nothing of Niven's imagination or plotting skills. Their content would have near-zero interest but for the fact that they were not swept up from your office floor, but from Larry Niven's.<br /><br />The editing is shoddy as well. There's no publication information at all (no citations for published items, no dates for unpublished ones). There's just no way to tell what has been published before, nor where. For example, half of the 100pp of actual fiction is a story, \\"Procrustes,\\" but there's no hint that it was previously published as part of Crashlander (Ballantine, 1994). The lack of this data makes the book irritating to read (ok, when WAS this Intercon he reports on?), and useless as scholarly source material.<br /><br />This book is for the library of an obsessive Niven completist collector. Ordinary readers will do well to save their $7.	2005-03-07

Books	2	23	40	N	N	the highly capable, depressed woman	This is an old book, in print more than 30 years, but as it has minimal topical references it has not become as dated as some SF of the 70s. It is a gray, gloomy, depressing story that remains a downer right through the last sentence--there's no last-minute discovery of a  meaning to life to redeem the book.<br /><br />The first-person narrator is a highly capable, intelligent woman with loads of forethought and a sardonic attitude. If she mustered any of these qualities in support of anything positive, she'd be -- well, she'd be Alyx, Russ's better-known hero. But this is Alyx's depressed, repressed evil twin. Alyx has a wise tolerance for people who are weaker or slower-witted than she; this person has only contempt.<br /><br />The circumstances are that that a few people have survived a crash-landing on a completely unmapped planet in an unknown place. The narrator instantly and clearly apprehends that they will never be rescued; they have neither the skills nor the equipment to create a viable colony; and they will probably all die of allergies to the unfamiliar planet's biota as soon as their stored food runs out -- and at best will die in squalor as their equipment wears out and life descends to the stone age. None of the others are ready to admit this reality; they cling to the hope that they can somehow survive. The guys start planning cabins and latrine systems and talking about which women should first contribute babies to the colony.<br /><br />The narrator just wants to die and get it over with. And she has quick, painless poison capsules. Why doesn't she just off herself and be done with it? Well, because if she did, the book would only be 20 pages long (and not a bad thing at that). Instead, and from motives that are never clear to me, she wants all the others to agree with her, to see as clearly as she does that they are doomed. She plays games with them, out-thinking them at every turn. She leads them on and when they try to dominate her by force, she begins killing them. Having slain everyone else in the party, she still doesn't kill herself. She hangs on for many more pages reviewing her past and hallucinating conversations with the people she killed. If she achieves any insight or clarity in these pages, I missed it.<br /><br />P.S. Why is Samuel R. Delaney listed on this edition as a co-author?

It jars you and spoils the poem. Almost every poem in this book has at least one broken rhythm like that -- often, several -- and it is maddening. If you want to enjoy light verse with grotesque art, read Edward Gorey and stay miles away from SCIENCE VERSE.

Scieszka has cute ideas but he's got a tin ear, and his poetic license should be revoked forthwith.<br /><br />Oh, and -- don't look for any actual teaching of science or the love of nature. The book gets its humor from playing word games with the vocabulary of science textbooks, or by poking snarky fun at how boring it all is.

But you know that kids today have different tastes, concerns, and outlooks than you in your formative decade. What to offer? <br /> <br />Be VERY careful before you offer them this book or its sequels. You can see by other reviews that Brian Jacques has garnered lots of enthusiastic fans. But there are some things that you, a doting parent, grandparent, or uncle or aunt, should know. <br /> <br />First, this is a violent book. There are a number of deaths, some quite awful. Jacques does not dwell on them, but he describes them vividly. Some are bad enough to cause shudders in some kids below the teens, and could play into the fears of some sensitive ones -- like when the fox backs into the giant snake in the dark, or when the brave defenders stop the invaders who are tunneling in by pouring big vats of boiling water down the hole to boil them, and then force the tunnel to collapse on them, burying them. There's an explicitly described, cold-blooded murder by strangulation. And there are many scenes of brutal cruelty, when sympathetic characters are beaten, clawed, and humiliated. <br /> <br />Just because these things happen in a beautifully pastoral setting among cute woodland animals doesn't mean they aren't violent and won't have an effect on the readers' imaginations. <br /> <br />Second, I was irked throughout by problems of scale. Jacques treats all characters and settings as if they were the same size. You have mice working alongside a squirrel, a hedgehog, and a badger. But how can that be? It's as if cocker spaniels stood alongside a horse, an elephant, and a tyrranosaurus rex -- that's how much bigger badgers are than mice. One other reviewer noted this, and the lack of humans. The mice inhabit an Abbey which seems to be built to human scale -- or is it? Because the mice manage to operate the doors and use the stairs, but then, so does the badger, who's 100 times as large. There's a Church of St. Ninian (so it must be C of E!) but it's occupied only by churchmice until the rats take it over. They, too, manage the doors and locks -- how? <br /> <br />In the other talking-animal books we love, scale is dealt with explicitly. In Walter R. Brooks's Freddy the Pig series, the spiders take care to keep out from underfoot, and small animals explicitly ride on big ones, etc. Scale is admitted and dealt with. In Watership Down, the rabbits are rabbit-sized, and other things in the world are their proper sizes too. <br /> <br />In REDWALL, things implicitly grow and shrink to be whatever size suits the animal and the needs of the plot. And that is simply sloppy. It makes it quite evident that Jacques wants to tell a tale of heroic fantasy among people, but he also wants to cloak that tale in the sheep's clothing of a cute animal story. <br /> <br />And that brings me to my final caution, the morality of the tale, or its lack thereof. It seems to me that Jacques has no particular moral stance or concern. He just wants to tell an exciting story with sympathetic good guys beating the snot out of unsympathetic bad ones. And he does, fairly effectively. But the only protagonist who even considers the possibility of nonviolent resolutions, the Abbot mouse, does so only for about 10 seconds, and then turns everything over to his military captains to run the show. There are two foxes who delight in double-dealing, and you might say there is a moral in that both end up brutally dead, but there's no connection between their perfidy and their deaths. One gets caught and is killed by the baddies, the other just has the bad luck to run into that snake. The only lesson to be drawn is that if you want to play both sides of the street, be more careful. <br /> <br />There are many sub-plots, and every one of them that I  can recall is resolved through force or trickery. Matthias the Mouse is a Hero because he's a Hero, not by any virtue of a learning process; he never doubts himself or questions the rightness of what he does. <br /> <br />All that said, this is fair page-turning entertainment for a well-balanced child with a healthy understanding of the difference between reality and fantasy.	2004-08-24

In Victorian-era romances, the Tragic Misunderstanding is a common plot device: the handsome He and the lovely, sensitive She are clearly meant for each other, but there is a Misunderstanding that keeps them apart until all is cleared up in the final chapter. In this slow-moving romance, He and She are kept apart by a device even more stale: mutual reluctance to express how they feel. So they stand and talk about anything but themselves, and go off to their lonely beds. <br />This is particularly weak because He is an experienced and wise manager, good at seeing other people's motivations and solving their problems; and She is from a culture that emphasizes warmth and communication. I don't find it ironic that these two, facing each other, can't break through to express their feelings; to me it feels like artificial manipulation of the reader. The fourth or fifth time they stood and looked at each other, and neither could find the nerve to reach out and touch the other (end of chapter 15), I just lost patience with the both of 'em and tossed the book away.<br />Based on reading that much, Shinn is excellent at creating female characters: her women are warm, real, and varied -- nice people to know. But I find her men quite unbelievable. Most of the males in the story are cartoon stereotypes (the Boor, the Sharp Trader, the Farmer, etc.), and the hero, Gaaron has all the life of a cigar-store indian. Only Dathan, the perpetual Other Man, has the feel of actuality; and he's gone from the scene quite early.	2004-05-25

The setting is a very complex sheaf of alternate universes. The universe in which we exist enters the story only as a brief way-stop near the end of the story. The other universes seem to be structured so that they are the realities whose psychic echoes inspire our mythologies. There's a Midgarth, which might be the source of the Norse myths, for example; and there's Alfen, home of some arrogant, immortal, and impossibly beautiful people. On the other hand, there's a Xiahon, which if it's meant to match a mythos, went right over my head. Indeed I suspect there are a lot of Duane-readers who don't have the background to recognize even as broad a clue as &quot;Midgarth&quot;.<br />All of what must be a very rich back-story is introduced in true SF style: never by direct exposition, only by passing references in the narrative. In reading SF, the pleasant riddle of figuring out what kind of world you're in, on your own without lectures from the author, is part of the fun. But here, I really wanted some exposition. Or, preferably, that hypothetical first volume of the series, a prequel with a simpler plot and a more leisurely exploration of the worlds of the &quot;Five-Geneva Pact.&quot;.	2004-05-04

The first disappointment was the quality of the writing: it reads like hasty first-draft stuff. Early on the authors twice use the illogical phrase &quot;could care less&quot; -- which shows they were putting down words without much involvement of an actual thought process. The whole book has to my ear a labored tone, as if they were grinding away on an unloved term paper. I was delighted to see that author Ringo has added a review here, saying in part, &quot;By the end of March to the Stars I was, frankly, running out of new ways to kill barbarians...&quot; I appreciate his frankness -- and I guess I appreciate his stamina in carrying on to finish Roger's story.<br />Except that they didn't. Finish it, that is. Gee whiz, guys, Xenophon did his trek, went home and retired to write his memoirs. But not our Roger -- he isn't anywhere near home, and he's lost most of the people he started out with. I feel cheated of the payoff you get at the end of Xenophon's March: they reach the sea, get a ship, and go home to live a long time polishing their well-earned medals. There's no vicarious payoff here; only the onset of more stress and trouble with ever-dwindling resources. Four more books, they say? I do not think I want to sign on for that hike.	2004-04-21

I would have tossed the book away halfway through, but it was the only available reading matter during a boring wait, so I persevered. My perseverance was not rewarded.<br />Most of these stories are just achingly clever in conception - what I gather the film world calls \\"high concept\\" - but they are emotionally empty, or intellectually empty, or sometimes both. They are mostly the kind of clockwork stories that a bright student in a creative writing class will produce when under deadline pressure - as I know from personal experience having written several of the kind myself. Gotta get something on paper, anything... and finally an opening sentence or an image comes to mind, and you push it as far as you can, using verbal and narrative tricks to hide the fact that you haven't a clue in heck as to how this situation could ever arise, nor what to do with it now it has arisen.<br />For an example I will cite what is undoubtedly the best of the stories in the book, David Levine's \\"Nucleon,\\" which also won a prize and appears in Hartwell's Best of the Year. A conceptual artist discovers a wonderful scrap yard run by an amazingly cute & insightful old-timer. The yard always seems to produce exactly the object the artist needs; it even turns out to contain a highly rare and reminiscent object from the narrator's childhood - helping him, possibly, reconcile to his childhood. Or not, it's all quite fuzzy. Then the lovable old-timer dies and wills the scrap yard to the artist, who suddenly finds he has acquired the amazing talent to lead others to exactly what they need to find the yard.<br />See what I mean about \\"high-concept\\"? There are lots of clever turns; the artist's creations have evocative titles that make us laugh and there are fun bits of trivia about old artifacts. When it's over, though, and you sit back and think about it, the story is about nothing at all. It's cotton-candy fiction, hermetically closed off from any real emotion or character development; no resonance with any human's real concerns; forgettable.<br />And that's the best of the lot. Second best would be \\"Flowers from Alice\\" by Cory Doctorow and Charles Stross. It has some of the bite of good SF; at several points you find yourself nodding in surprise, thinking, oh! yes!, that's possible, that's how it could be! But the final twist, one, caused me to lose sympathy with the character (his troubles are all of his own making), and two, made me realize how John Varley had rung all the same bells much more melodically.<br />The rest might look good in the creative writing prof's in-basket, but wouldn't (I hope and trust) make it past the slush pile of a decent magazine. In sum, don't spend money here unless you have a LOT of time between flights at DFW.	2004-03-09

It starts well, in the manner a classic thriller: the protagonist is rolling along when the bottom falls out of his world, and he's left disoriented, trying to survive among shadows and hints of awful danger.<br />But the loose ends are just too numerous; the bad guys' weapon is just not credible; and there's no ending.<br />Loose ends: there are characters introduced who just vanish, as if Bear lost interest in them. I've never before read a book where a character (Mrs. Callas) is carefully introduced, has a lot of dialog, and then says &quot;I don't like your chances and I want out&quot; -- and walks out of the story!<br /> But the biggest problem for me was the simply incredible details of the mcguffin, the bacterial stealth weapon. Altered gut bacteria that make people sick, or that poison their brain chemistry to make them unstable or credulous, that I could credit. But I cannot credit that such a blunt tool could do the precision work of forcing a  person to commit explicit behavior -- like, make a person go and shoot, or sic dogs on, a specific person.<br />There are horrifying details of a supposed Soviet experimental camp, but the details don't hang together -- how could such effects result from the suggested mechanism, and what possible political ends could be served by continuing such experiments until everyone was dead?<br />And there's a lot of business about people getting calls that seem to be from dead loved ones. What's the point? How is that supposed to result from, or interact with, their bacterial poisoning? There are several references to bacterially &quot;tagged&quot; victims being given lists of numbers to memorize, and these numbers cause specific reactions. Bacteria that do arithmetic?<br />There are apparently minor characters who turn up in totally unlikely places with no explanation (What the heck is Betty Shum doing on Lemuria?). There are mysteries that are carefully and explicitly planted (the 1949 picture of Rudy) and never resolved or explained. Indeed, there is an Epilog that consists mostly of the protagonist reviewing all the questions that were never answered, and they are numerous -- and remain unanswered.<br />In short, the furniture of this book just doesn't hang together; and that is death to a science-fiction story. It's just weirdness piled on weirdness, with no coherence or sense. Maybe since &quot;The X Files&quot; this is an accepted mode of SF storytelling, but I can't buy it.	2004-02-24

Alas, I and many, many others have discovered from painful experience that AppleScript is hugely difficult to approach -- its learning curve never seems to flatten out. Even after writing thousands of lines of code in several programs that (eventually) worked, I still feel I'm groping in the dark every time I try something new. I've read other books on AppleScript, looking for one that would open the magic door and reveal the simple, friendly AppleScript that's supposed to exist.<br />Matt Neuburg has given us the first AppleScript book that tells the deep truth: AppleScript is a quirky, inconsistent programming language that is not only hard to learn, but hard to learn for fundamental, structural reasons. Neuburg exposes the unavoidable difficulties that are built into AppleScript's design, and then shows us practical techniques for accomodating to them and using them.<br />Anyone who reads this book carefully will be  able to apply AppleScript with greater understanding and less wasted time, and be able to use it with far less of the disappointment, frustration, and even rage felt by all too many people who collide unprepared with AppleScript's tricks and traps.<br />Since there's no &quot;look inside the book&quot; feature, let me summarize the main sections. Part I explores AppleScript in a system context: what it is meant to do; how it is used (with an intro to the Script Editor); and what its basic concepts are. (Contra another reviewer, this 90pp part contains nothing about history; it's all current and relevant stuff, needed later in the book.)<br />Central to Part I is Chapter 3, &quot;The AppleScript Experience,&quot; which describes the actual process of building a program. This chapter so perfectly reflected the confusions, frustrations, and dead-ends that I've experienced with AppleScript that I was sold: this guy really understands the problems! He doesn't minimize them or blame them on me. Maybe he can show me ways to work around them, but whether he does or not, at least he'd validated them.<br />Part II, 200pp, is a detailed and insightful exposition of the AppleScript language. Early in this part is a discussion of &quot;The 'English-Likeness' Monster,&quot; showing how the attempt to be friendly distorts the language and confuses users. <br />Then Neuburg examines every detail of AppleScript's syntax and semantics. He doesn't do this like a typical &quot;tech writer,&quot; rephrasing the official documentation. He has taken the time to write code to test out every corner case and exception of the language, and he lays them all bare. He looks into AppleScript's baroque scoping rules and its inconsistent rules for implicit coercion of types.<br />All of Part II is meat and drink to a fan of programming languages, and I read it through like a good novel. More to the point, it's a deep and thorough job of documenting the actuality of AppleScript: what syntax works, what the tricks and traps are, and what to avoid.<br />Part III tries to extend the same thorough methods to the process of creating applications in AppleScript, beginning with application dictionaries. Here Neuburg, like every other AppleScript user, bangs hard into the basic structural flaw of AppleScript: that all the interesting semantics and no small part of the syntax are implemented in other applications, not in AppleScript. Everything you want to actually accomplish with AppleScript, you do by sending messages to other programs -- the Finder, TextEdit, BBEdit, Mail, and so forth. The only documentation you have is each app's dictionary, and it can never be adequate. Chapter 19, &quot;Dictionaries,&quot; contains a long editorial on &quot;Inadequacies of the Dictionary&quot; that details all the reasons that an app's dictionary can never tell you enough to use the app. Some of the reasons are structural (there's just no way to express the needed information) and some are due to human failure (the people who write dictionaries do a clumsy, inconsistent, and sometimes erroneous job). Neuburg can't fix these issues, but he does his best to prepare you to work around them.

However, to avoid disappointment, it is very important to understand what its &quot;kind&quot; is!<br />This is NOT -- as the subtitle and the cover art could misleadingly suggest -- a user-friendly introduction to Buddhist practice. It is not a hand-holding tour of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold way, with beginning training in meditation. If you buy it expecting such things, you may well write another negative review.<br />The authors are academics specializing in the history of religion (see Smith's other books, which are widely respected), and they are both Buddhist practitioners. In this book they combine these traits to write a deep, sympathetic account of Buddhism as a religion: what its main tenets are -- how it is practiced -- how it fractured historically into different strands. They write analytically and comparitively, but they also write with understanding and sympathy. They treat Buddhism as a living religion to be practiced by modern people - not as an anthropological artifact, the way some non-Buddhist authors do.<br />Smith and Novak are particularly good at describing, sympathetically and in depth, the philosophical roots of the different practices in each strand. The chapters that compare the differing values of the Mahayana and Theravada strains, and then show their fundamental unity, is worth the book's price. They also tease out the key differences between the four types of Tibetan Buddhism, and explain the sources and values of other schools as different as Goenka and Pure Land.<br />They are also good at showing and how Western practices were formed by the sheer happenstance of which individuals happened to first import Buddhist thought, and which Eastern school they happened to stumble upon for their initial training.<br />Finally, they do a good job of showing how Western, and especially American, Buddhism is in many ways a different beast from any Eastern form, and still evolving.<br />The main problem with the book, aside from its slightly-misleading title, is that it is too short. For some reason, the authors felt they had to restrict the length. At several points they apologize for giving only a &quot;summary&quot; of some important point (like: Buddhism in Europe). And several key concepts are only sketched in the end-notes, when they deserve to be written out in full and integrated into the book. I'm only giving 4 of 5 stars because of this compression.	2003-12-01
US	52986449	R1Y07LC10HZMPG	006447352X	512932093	Fire and Hemlock	Books	4	15	15	N	N	A mix of great and muddled	Diana Wynne Jones is a writer who deserves to be better known and more widely read in the USA, and this is surely her most complicated, subtle book. It is not a young child's book nor a read-aloud one; and it is not for the person looking for a straight-ahead story of sorcery and adventure. It is the sort of book that needs a reader who is willing to do some of the work: for example by not just rushing by the quotes at the head of each chapter but reading them and thinking how they might relate to the plot; noticing how the book is structured and taking that as a hint; and so on. Read the other reviews and see how much those who did loved the book -- even though they were still confused by the ending.<br />In my opinion, Jones has asked too much of her readers. There is work that the reader just can't do (or I couldn't) to fill in the gaps. This would be a better (but longer) book if she had filled in some of the gaps; made some of the emotional transitions more understandable; given explanations for some of the weird things that are never explained. (Like: is the picture really changed, or is it Polly's perceptions that are changed?)<br />And there's no word  for the ending but \\"confusing\\" and that's hard to forgive in a writer as good and as experienced as Jones. It reads to me as if she had a deadline and just finished the dang chapter somehow to get it out. The imagery is baffling; the rules of the contest are baffling; the final result is baffling (is Laurel still alive?  Can Polly and Tom now be friends or not? is Leslie free now? &c.) and there is no emotional payoff, no resolution of the emotional tension between Polly and the other characters.<br />Despite this, I give it 4 stars because of all the really good things in it. Polly is a gallant and clever person to live with. There's lots of subtle humor (like Polly at age 11 setting out to make herself a hero). The whole issue of how Polly deals with her flawed and unreliable parents is told with immense sympathy and power. And so on. Just don't expect to understand the ending...	2003-09-23
US	52986449	R1ZDYJJ82O6KWS	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	A tale of survival, but...	...not the kind of survival it seems to be about on the surface. Yes, the protagonist survives a shipwreck and a long time adrift in a lifeboat. But the book is not about how he survived the actual disaster; it is about how he continues to survive now, adrift on the sea of the rest of his life, accompanied by the tiger of memory, which he barely controls with the red whistle of imagination...<br />As other reviewers noted, the real meaning of the book is not revealed (and then only indirectly) in the final chapter. The achievement of Yann Martel is that he is able to present a veritable three-ring circus of vivid detail to keep us entertained while we drift toward that final revelation.  As in any circus, some of the acts don't come off. Among the things that did not work for me: Martel's occasional writerly intrusions, as when he archly points out that he's telling the story in precisely 100 (quite arbitrary) chapters. And the whole interlude on the floating island has no purpose, in my opinion, other than to help him reach the count of 100. (The floating island is a finely-realized piece of imaginary botany, yes, which would fit perfectly in a hard-SF novel, but this isn't one; Martel should have kept it in his drawer for another book.)<br />And there are places where Martel's clearly extensive and detailed research is just too evident. Some of the set-piece lectures on animal psychology etc. are expository lumps that don't go down smoothly.<br />Finally, the whole peripheral business about God and belief is, so far as I can tell, simply not in the book at all -- just projections by hopeful readers onto an elusive work. The book is &quot;about&quot; the psychology of survival; the part that is played in that by the protagonist's religion is minimal.	2003-08-07

It is true that Avatar advances, with great authority and confidence, a number of ideas that are just flat wrong. However, there is no internal evidence that Adams himself recognizes these as errors. Does Adams think that gravity propogates instantly, or that a magnetic field cannot be shielded? There is no hint of irony to indicate that. The book's nameless protagonist is completely clueless.  In the dialogs of Socrates (to which other reviewers have compared this book), the people arguing with Socrates make good points, have cogent arguments. In this book, the Avatar has the debate all his own erroneous way.<br />The result is that people who are not well grounded in science find a lot of claims that strike them as &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot; when in fact the claims are simply wrong, and well-known to be wrong.<br />For the record here are some of Avatar's errors of fact: (p19) magnetic fields can't be blocked; (p19) gravity propogates instantly; (p22) we don't understand how electricity travels; (p61) there is no friction between the Earth and the Moon (the statements about gravity and the Moon are wrong in multiple ways); (p66) the theory of evolution is a &quot;concept with no practical application&quot;.<br />The Avatar advances a dangerous, nihilistic kind of epistemology. In plain language, he seems to dismiss all possible sources of knowledge as equally pointless. He dismisses mathematics as useless (p. 20-21, p56). He dismisses all of science (&quot;all we can do is observe and record patterns,&quot; p.22) as being unable to provide &quot;why&quot; answers. Finally he says that all ideas are equally valid (p38ff) because they are all identically &quot;memory traces&quot; in our brains. This may be what others have called &quot;New-Agey&quot; but in fact it is nihilism and defeatism.<br />As to the philosophy, it is basically self-contradictory. If you take the time to read the book, read it carefully and then actually think about the Avatar's basic claims: (a) God blew itself up in order to learn the one thing omniscience could not know, namely, what happens if God isn't there; but (b) God imbued his debris with a &quot;probability&quot; so strong that even if the universe were rewound and played back, exactly the same events would happen over again (p.51-2). These ideas are fundamentally contradictory, hence the whole exercise is pointless.<br />The Avatar does pose a number of philosophical riddles that have been standard fodder for student bull-sessions for generations. Example: if God is omniscient (Adams incorrectly writes &quot;omnipotent&quot;), the future must be determined, hence how can we, or God, have free will?  But the questions are only posed, never explored in any satisfying way. Go looking for better books in elementary philosophy.	2003-07-19

A demanding program of self-improvement emerges: connect to others, learn to meditate, find heroes, define your ethics, prepare a legacy, simplify life. The results of such a \\"secular life practice\\" might or might not be, as the author claims, the same as religion produces, but they could only be healthy. Were it lighter and folksier, this book might have been \\"Chicken Soup for the Scientist's Soul,\\"  but with its educated prose, end-notes, bibliography and two indexes, Secular Wholeness would have to be \\"Soup to nuts for the soul with port and cigars after.\\"...	2002-04-03

I side with those who find its numerous errors and its sensationalism unpleasant.<br />Of the errors, the one on page 162 (another reviewer mistyped it as 62) is the most egregious and bears quoting:<br />\\"Figuring out how to spin a magnet had been the key in designing the dynamo. At first...engineers had used an _electric motor_ to spin the dynamo's magnet; the motor itself was kept spinning by siphoning off some of the electricity produced by the dynamo.\\"<br />This clearly describes a perpetual motion machine. (Think: if we could build generators that power themselves, why would we ever use dams or nuclear reactors to power them?) In the chapter on thermodynamics, Guillen shows that he is aware that perpetual motion is impossible. But here he fails to recognize that, in groping to explain who-knows-what ill-digested concept, he has invented one. If he can't handle basic mechanics, how can we trust him to explain relativity?<br />The much-lauded human-interest side of the book is even more suspect. Guillen describes the emotional and mental state of Newton, Bernoulli, et al, with the intimate confidence of a confessor. He could not possibly have known how Rudolf Clausius felt as he listened to his wife scream in her terminal agony, or whether he related her pain to the concept of entropy. He couldn't possibly know how Newton felt about the grammar school bully, and so on. The phrase \\"how could he know that?\\" occurred to me over and over as I read these episodes. In fact, he can't know it. All these gripping insights are inventions, and have no more claim on our interest than the inventions of any novelist.<br />If Guillen had any authoritative sources he hasn't shared them. This is not just academic nit-picking; a bibliography would be a service to the reader who gets interested in, for example, the life of Faraday, and wants to read further. None is given.<br />Finally, Guillen treats philosophy with the same kindof sensationalism that he uses on imaginary emotional lives. Here's one of several passages on the relation of science to religion (p. 55):<br />\\"Earth's gravity, Newton had demonstrated, extended to the moon and beyond; indeed, there was no place in the universe that did not feel its influence... Consequently, there was no place left uncorrupted in the universe for God to dwell. He had been crowded out of our picture of the universe by gravity's infinite reach. For the first time in Western history, the heavens had been completely despoiled; God's perfect existence had been purged ignominiously from our scientific theories.\\"<br />Whether you are a secularist like me or a theist, this sweeping claim should make your jaw drop. The extension of gravity to infinity might blow away Plato's and Aristotle's notions of the purity of the celestial spheres, but did it perturb any more recent thinker? This kind of claim, breath-takingly broad and grossly oversimplified, lacking all nuance and without any sort of support or documentation, is common in the book.<br />Pieces of this book are entertaining and occasionally insightful. But it has far too many flaws of the sorts described here to be worth anyone's purchase.	2002-03-27
US	52986449	R3ERURZMFQO5OM	0670891932	767275402	Buddha (Penguin Lives)	Books	3	163	196	N	N	not a book for buddhists	In summary, Armstrong's \\"Buddha\\" is a brief, sympathetic  account of the life of the Buddha in the context of his time. It is marred by brevity and by a distanced, clinical treatment of the Buddha's dhamma that makes it seem little more than an antique, cultural artifact, not a relevant way of life.<br />I am guessing that  the format for the Penguin \\"Lives\\" series  accounts for some of the shortcomings of this book including: its brief length (less than 200 rather small pages); its lack of illustrations; its rather abrupt end with the Buddha's death (not a word of how one teacher's words grew into a worldwide religion); the absence of a guide to the pronunciation of the many Pali terms; and the omission of an index.<br />These lacks show the book is not intended as a definitive biography; nor it is it intended to have theological depth that would challenge a well-read Buddhist. This is a popular \\"life\\" intended to give a broad picture of the Buddha's life and dhamma to a curious non-Buddhist reader or to a student.<br />Within the scope of this limited goal  Armstrong has done a reasonably good job. Certainly it could not have been easy to shape a conventional, biographical tale from the Pali canon and other Buddhist scriptures.  Armstrong stresses that an integral part of the Buddha's teaching was the unimportance of the ego, and for that reason the Buddha's personal attributes virtually disappeared, both from his teachings and from his disciple's accounts. Little is left but the suttas themselves, and some highly-colored legends surrounding the key moments of the Buddha's life.<br />Armstrong is particularly good at taking the legends and drawing out their inner meaning. She recounts a legend sympathetically; then shows how it make clear sense, not as history but as a statement of belief in the context of the time, or as an archetypal portrait of the human condition.  For example, she notes how Mara, Lord of Illusion, \\"represents ... all the unconscious elementswithin the psyche  which fight against our liberation.\\"<br />In large measure Armstrong explains the Buddha's dhamma clearly and sympathetically. Yet she always seems to handle it with metaphorical tongs, like an interesting specimen -- not as if it were a living tradition the reader might enter. Part of this impression comes from her consistent use of the perfect tense when describing the dhamma. For example, she writes \\"The purpose of both mindfulness and the immeasurables was to neutralize the power of that egotism that limits human potential.\\"  In this and many similar sentences, she uses the perfect (\\"was\\") or the conditional (\\"would\\"), as if the dhamma was a teaching that existed only long ago and among distant people. There is no hint that mindfulness IS used for the same purpose by people today.<br />This is a subtle matter of diction and tone; but its effect is to transmit an unspoken message that Armstrong herself has not entered into the Dhamma, and probably wouldn't care to recommend it to her reader, either.  If you think of yourself as being in some degree \\"buddhist\\" you may find this air of faint praise makes you uncomfortable.<br />A less subtle problem is Armstrong's repeated insistence that the Dhamma \\"could not be understood by rational thinking alone. It only revealed its true significance when it was apprehended 'directly,' according to yogic methods, and in the right ethical context.\\"  By \\"yogic methods\\" she means the disciplines of mindfulness and meditation. By \\"ethical context\\" she means principly the practice of metta, empathy.<br />Armstrong seems sure that the dhamma is not capable of being defended or supported by discursive argument. Or at any rate, she does not even attempt to sketch its philosophical underpinnings. This is strange. Armstrong is certainly capable of dealing with abstracts and logical argument. And Buddhism is quite respectable as a  philosophy, as coherent and complete in its account of the universe and the human condition as anything produced by Plato or Aquinas.  Armstrong completely neglects this aspect of the dhamma, leaving the impression that it can only be entered through \\"yogic methods.\\"  In short, she writes as if the dhamma is unapproachable unless you are ready to enter into dubious Eastern practices.	2001-04-03

Comparing the qualities of his experience to others in literature, he thought he saw a pattern: the experiences typically occurred  mostly to men in their middle years, and were increasing in number with  time. (In fact, one can imagine many ways in which all three trends could  be statistical flukes; assertions of this kind are to a modern eye not  justified by the evidence.)<br />Bucke leaped to the optimistic conclusion  that humankind was evolving to a higher level of mental attainment, and  that someday, instead of a favored few having sporadic flashes of Insight,  all would possess Cosmic Consciousness all the time. In this book he tries  to show that this one mind-state was the driver of great intellectual and  moral attainments throughout history.<br />Bucke finds the image of his own  experience in just about every spiritual and intellectual leader known to  history. According to Bucke, the alternate state he calls Cosmic is, among  other things, what Christ meant by \\"the kingom of heaven,\\" what St. Paul  meant whenever he referred to \\"Christ,\\" what Dante referred to when he said  \\"Beatrice,\\" and the subject to whom Francis Bacon was writing when he  composed the first 110 sonnets now incorrectly attributed to  Shakespeare!<br />Although Bucke was highly educated in the science of his  day, this book is in no way a work of science. Bucke is so avid about his  hypothesis that he can't let any evidence stand on its own feet; he must  select and interpret everything. Some of his interpretations are clearly  over the top (the assertion that Paul meant \\"alternate state of  consciousness\\" whenever he wrote \\"Christ\\" would cause most Biblical  scholars to choke on their tea, yet it is put forward casually in a  footnote), and those exaggerations make us suspicious of all his claims. He  is guilty of circular argument: discussing his cases as a group, he claims  to show thatmost who get Cosmic Consciousness, get it in their thirties or  forties. Then when discussing each case alone, whenever he can find  evidence that the person had some kind of experience in his middle years,  he takes that age as evidence that the experience was Cosmic Consciousness!  And he is poorly served by nineteenth-century science, as for example when  he asserts that humankind only recently evolved color vision, based partly  on a German philologist's claim that Sanskrit had no color words, or  speculates that \\"low races\\" such as \\"the Bushmen of South Afrika\\" do not  have the same level of consciousness as we Aryans.<br />In short, while  Bucke's own two-paragraph account of his experience is quoted in William  James' \\"Varieties of Religious Experience\\" and in almost every other book  on mystical experience, his explanation for the experience, and the  philosophical and historical theories he spins from it, are not of any use  to a modern reader.	2000-03-03

Susan Lieberman felt the need to give her family a richer emotional life, and  found that the conventional holidays and customs didn't satisfy in the  context of modern American culture.<br />So for a couple of years she simply  asked everyone she met whether they had invented any new family traditions.  And she found dozens.  She compiled the real experiences of real families  -- simple accounts of what worked and what didn't in creating rich,  satisfying family circles.<br />The suggestions are amazingly simple, yet  endlessly inventive. There's the family that decided they would all  (parents &amp; 3 kids) walk the family dog after supper every night.  Regardless of weather, out they go; walking in all sorts of different  pairings and groupings depending on who has what on their minds to talk  about. Or the &quot;you are special&quot; dinner plate which, hokey as it  seems, works: it appears as the supper plate of whoever has a success or a  birthday or any other reason to be feted by the rest of the family that  day.<br />Simple ideas, worked out in real life by real people, to make real  lives more resonant.  This is a superb book that I'll be giving away as a  present to at least 3 other families I can think of, next Christmas.	2000-01-12

Visualize in turn the friends (and,  I would add, public role models) that you most respect. For each one, think  of the good quality that you would like to borrow from that person to help  you through the coming medical ordeal -- courage, patience, whatever.  Choose a color of yarn to represent that person's quality and wind it  around the stick.  Keep the yarn-wrapped stick with you throughout the  hospital stay.  Sensibly, Biziou never even hints that the stick itself  contains any power; she knows that the comfort you gain from having it  close to you is generated in your own mind, through recollection of the  people whose qualities you are &quot;borrowing.&quot;<br />And there are group  ceremonies, like a ceremony of mutual appreciation to help a group of  coworkers bond and support each other.<br />Some of Biziou's advice is just  plain silly, like her discussion of the symbolic meanings of colors and  scents: Black symbolizes &quot;release&quot; and &quot;the unknown&quot; --  but not, apparently, death or emptiness -- and red, &quot;passion, energy,  creation, stamina&quot; -- but neither &quot;danger&quot; nor  &quot;stop.&quot; The scent of parsley symbolizes protection and dill,  mental clarity, and so on until you just want to say &quot;c'mon Barbara,  get real.&quot;  In my opinion a few of her opinions, especially on health,  could be damaging because she is so clever at asserting that illness comes  from bad thoughts -- which means that if you don't get well, it's your own  fault for not thinking correctly. I think it's a crime to propagate that  cruel and stupid concept.<br />However, many of the ceremonies she describes  should indeed be nourishing to the spirit and psychologically healing. For  those who can permit themselves unashamedly to participate in a ritual,  there should be genuine emotional power and closure to many of these  activities.	1999-12-30

In this book he addresses two questions that seem to have nearly equal importance to him: (1) Is it possible to live a good life without religion? (2) Should secular humanism be called a religion?  His answer to the first is an emphatic Yes. He chooses the term Eupraxophy -- from the Greek roots for &quot;good,&quot; &quot;practice,&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot; -- to name an approach to life that comprises these elements: a cosmic theory based on the best available science; a method of testing all claims to truth based on rationality and a &quot;positive&quot; skepticism; an ethical stance founded in the &quot;common moral decencies&quot; (Kurtz detailed his approach to humanist ethics in another book, &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot;); and finally, commitment to a set of political ideas derived from these things. Kurtz enthusiastically paints an attractive picture of a committed, engaged life founded in human rationality. His argument in this area is flawed only by his frequent digressions into religion-bashing. He seems compelled to not only paint a positive picture of Eupraxophy, but at the same time to denigrate the theistic approach to life. I found these negative passages intrusive. The second question (what is a religion and should humanism be called one?) is perhaps important to Kurtz, to other leaders of the humanist movement, and to their opponents in the religious right who would like to bring their critics under the same legal constraints that bind them.  However, this question has little interest to the general reader looking for models of how to live well, and I wish Kurtz had reserved it to a different forum.	1998-01-23

While there he was inspired to write The<br />Rights of Man, his greatest political tract. The British government took<br /> offense, and Paine only just escaped arrest for sedition, crossing the<br /> channel to revolutionary France. The French, whose own revolution owed no<br /> small debt to his writings, gave him a hero's welcome, but not much time<br /> passed before he fell out of favor with the revolutionary government there.<br /> Aging, ill, and out of favor, his mind turned to philosophy and he began to<br /> put down &quot;my thoughts upon religion.&quot;  He sets forth two themes at the<br /> outset. First, contradicting the modern notion that he was an atheist, he<br /> wrote, &quot;I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond<br /> this  life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious<br /> duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make  our<br /> fellow creatures happy.&quot;  But a second theme dominates most of the book: &quot;I<br /> do not believe in the creed professed by...the Protestant church, nor  by<br /> any church that I know of. My own mind is my church. All national<br /> institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear  to<br /> me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave  mankind,<br /> and monopolize power and profit.&quot; And with that he deployed the full power<br /> of one of the most amazing rhetorical voices ever raised, with no smaller<br /> aim than to destroy the credibility of all religion, and especially that of<br /> the Christian denominations.  He completed the first part of the book the<br /> day the French arrested him; it was published while he spent months in a<br /> cell waiting to be guillotined.  Released at last, he sat down to complete<br /> the work. The second part is a detailed and savage deconstruction of the<br /> Christian Bible. When Paine wrote, the idea of examining the Bible as a<br /> text objectively, let alone critically, was unheard of. Paine finds many of<br /> the internal contradictions and barbarities of the Bible and lays them out<br /> with withering scorn. After going through the Bible &quot;as a man would go<br /> through a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees,&quot; he lays out in<br /> a few pages a positive vision of the Deity he believes in and of a possible<br /> afterlife. These quieter pages are touching and have an astonishing<br /> modernity. However, Paine's contemporaries could not grasp the idea of<br /> loving God while hating the Church, and decided that he was an atheist.<br /> Returning to the States, he was hounded and vilified the rest of his life,<br /> eventually dying in poverty. Finally, even his body was lost, and there is<br /> no Paine grave today.ritically, was unheard of.
