They always expect him to give in and take it because he's always so nice. He decides it's time for a change, especially after his girlfriend Kristin puts her best friend Lacey over him. So he and his band write a song called &quot;Too Nice&quot;, about a guy getting really sick of being a human doormat and how it's time for change. Kristin hears it without Brian knowing, and she's furious because she thinks it's their break-up song, but things get much better in the end. While all this is going on Salvador is acting really strange around Elizabeth, always grilling her about hanging out with Blue, and Sal is wondering if maybe he doesn't like her all over again. The author (Jamie Suzanne, NOT Francine Pascal) did a great job of writing about very real situations, and with very believable characters.	2001-07-20

Although it isn't my favorite Alice book I have still already read it 3 times anyway. In this addition to the Alice series Alice is going through the summer before seventh grade. There are the mortifying scenes that Alice just can't seem to avoid---like when her friends' boyfriends made fun of Pamela's bra and caused some strain on their relationships. Elizabeth goes through heartbreak from her first boyfriend, Tom Perona, and Pamela gets the embarrassment of her life when her bikini top falls off while at the beach. Alice decides to make a difficult decision in the end about her boyfriend Patrick, but knows it's for the best. It was very clear in this book how much Alice yearned for a mother, but I was kind of surprised how very unknowledgeable she was about things like guys and her body.	2001-07-20

I did like Georgia's diary because it made me laugh out loud a lot, and reading her English expressions was interesting and new. She does think like many girls ..., with her own problems about parents, her looks (particularly her larger-than-life-or-so-she-says nose) and self-consciousness when it comes to the opposite sex. I only gave the book 4 stars though because the book sometimes seemed to be going on and on about not very much. I didn't find realistic Georgia's outright rudeness to her parents and the fact that she actually let a boy she didn't even like all that much \\"rest\\" his hand on her breast. And I'm confused by the way Georgia writes so on the spot---does she really carry her journal around and write in it when she's spying on people or going to a party? I don't think it's a book to be taken too seriously when it comes to real life, but it's an excellent choice when you just want to relax and have a good laugh.	2001-07-01

The Weiss family suffers rejection and spite from friends and neighbors turned pro-Hitler, even though they are non-practicing Jews. Nazis come to the Weiss home one night and all of Julie's family BUT herself is taken outside. They come back unharmed but changed. This event forces her older brother Max to leave the country and her mother to later commit suicide. Her father still tries to keep a positive outlook on everything, and says Julie must go to America, where she will be safe with her mother's sister and her husband. In Part 1, Julie's entries are at first mostly about her school life and worries that a girl her social status might have, but are emotional and full of descriptions of violence against Jews. In the beginning of Part 2 she is still afraid, sad and frozen but things get brighter for her in New York, especially when she lands a part in a stage play. Overall a very good read and a big improvement from Mr. Denenberg's other DA books.	2001-07-01

It's most definitely one of my most favorite stories! Jill Marie Landis is my favorite historical romance writer and she did not disappoint me at all with &quot;The Orchid Hunter&quot;, which as she wrote in the back of the book, is &quot;a story that will make you laugh and cry&quot;, which it did. Not many books can make me cry but parts of this one did! Ms. Landis made me feel everything that the main characters (Janelle, Joya and Trevor) were feeling. This book had everything---adventure, mystery and romance. And unlike some of the romance novels I've read, this one truly showed the love that grew between Joya and Trevor. The characters had life, nothing was terribly unrealistic, and this very well-written story was never boring for me. I loved everything about this book. High up on my recommended list!	2001-06-23

I was expecting this book to be very good because I know that Nora Roberts is a popular romance writer. &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; was the first book by her that I've read and my expectations were not at all met. It was extremely overdramatic and most of the time I would feel like rolling my eyes. The conversations were much too lengthy and didn't always reveal very much and the characters were too horny. They made it sound more like lust than love. The ending was pretty abrupt and also very unrealistic. DUMB. I'm not reading another Nora Roberts, especially after having read that most of her books are the same plot and characters over and over again.	2001-06-20

Fourteen-year-old Anetka Kaminska's life in Poland is about to change drastically when she finds out that her father, working in America, has given her hand in marriage to a man she has never met. In exchange for a young bride from the old country, the man, Stanley Gawrych, has agreed to pay for her and her younger brother's passage to America. Anetka is outraged (&quot;I do not want to go to America to marry a man I do not love!&quot;) but can do nothing but obey her father. She is forced to leave behind her grandmother and the land she calls home. When she arrives in Stanley's home, Anetka is immediately turned into a mother for Stanley's three motherless children from his previous marriage, and a caretaker for their home. She writes about her disappointment in her marriage to Stanley, saying that she can't feel any of his love for her at all. But in the end, Anetka finds true happiness in a man she did not expect to fall in love with, and for him to love her just as much.<br />I really loved Anetka's story but thought that there wasn't all that much about the Lattimer Massacre. I loved learning about life in 1896 as a young bride forced to marry a man she doesn't love, and having to take care of his house and children too! Even though she isn't a real person, I'm sure Anetka had a life similar to other young brides, and I admire them because of their strength. Anetka's story tells so much about being a young bride and so well-told that I could vividly imagine it all in my mind. This book was exceptionally well-written. I LOVE IT!	2001-06-18

Ms. Kaysen talks at length about one topic and then in the next chapter talks about another. The actual experiences of being in the hospital were only in a few short chapters. Or maybe Ms. Kaysen just writes in a VERY unique style that I just can't get used to. Anyway I didn't enjoy this book and was pretty disappointed. Maybe the movie will turn out better.	2001-06-18

They have migrated from Russia to escape the Tsar's violent cruelty towards the Jews. The story focuses on the Feldman family, life for immigrant Jews in 1903, and Jewish practices are also very often spoken about. I was just a little confused when Yiddish words were present and Zippy did not really explain what they meant, and terms such as Yom Kippur, I don't really know. <br />Zippy and her family live in a cramped, one-window tenement apartment. At first Zippy is miserable---she finds their apartment terrible and she is only in SECOND GRADE at school! She is so embarrassed because she is 12 and only in second grade, but she is soon cheered up by the arrival of her new friend Blu, who is also an immigrant and does not speak English either. But they both work very hard to be promoted and a year and a half later are in their proper grade. Zippy also meets new friends that bring her amusement. Then Mama, as Zippy says, is so confusing, because it seems one foot is in their old hometown of Zarichka and the other in New York. She is angry at first because Papa no longer sports his Jewish gear and Mama is still very firm with Jewish traditions and has quite a bit of cultural shock. Tovah is the eldest Feldman sister and believes that women should be allowed to vote, hates the conditions in the sweatshops that most immigrant Jews worked in, and starts a union for that cause. Miriam, Zippy's 15-year-old sister, finds love in New York and gets married secretly. Papa works in a sweatshop at first but later goes back to playing his violin marvelously and even plays for the public, who loves his playing. Many things happen in this never-boring story, most of which are sad, like the deaths of the Feldman girls' friend Mamie and of Yossel Feldman, who lived five days before dying of weak lungs. But Zippy is still able to find happiness when she gets involved with her beloved theater---first as a props girl and then her number-one dream, an actress. This book is a wonderful read and if you haven't read it yet, I highly urge you to.	2000-12-29

She is crushed for a few days and pretty much ignores her drama club friends, Toby and Anna---and when she does talk to them, is not as open and friendly as she had been before. Larissa finally agrees to let Anna tutor her when she finds out that the girl who won the lead role Larissa wanted so badly, Bianca, also had slipping grades and was being tutored. I thought Larissa was being a stuck-up brat because she was so stubborn to accept that she needed help in her schoolwork. Read this if you like, but it isn't on my highly-recommended list.	2000-12-22

In this book we get to know Blue Spiccoli, one of those slacker-type people, who decides to shape up FAST when he heard that their social worker is coming by to check up on him. Blue and his older brother Leaf (funky names!) are orphans and Leaf is Blue's legal guardian. He makes video games for a living and is also the coach of the unpopular SVJH volleyball team, which Elizabeth joins. Because of that Blue and his friends get to know Elizabeth (and Blue develops an interest in Liz). They hang out at the Spiccoli house for pizza and to test video games---basically to have fun. For a while Blue and Elizabeth rub off on each other and Liz forgets to do her homework and comes home late without permission. Blue starts joining every club in school he can to show the social worker that yes, Leaf takes care of him just fine. Towards the end Blue and Liz have a heated argument about the other being too uptight or too slack, but they make up soon after, and consider each other good friends. It is also in this book where the school carnival Kristin Seltzer has planned for so long finally happens. There are things going on with Kristin and her boyfriend, Brian, and Bethel finds out a little something about Lacey, but that I'll let you read about. :)	2000-11-07

I think this is the best Narnia book in the whole series because it was never boring and it had a wonderful ending. It is about an ape and a donkey finding a lion's-skin and use it to look like Aslan to have power over the Narnian population. It was not the donkey's fault, though, because the Ape was so convincing that the donkey just kept on going with the plan. It is kind of eerie though the way the book was written to be like the book of Revelation, and I was surprised that Susan isn't one of the Seven Friends of Narnia. She could not possibly just outgrow Narnia and think it was just a silly game she and her siblings used to play. In the story the old Narnia ends and a new, much better Narnia begins. To add, I think it is better for the Harper Collins series of the Narnia books to be read in the order the publishers want them to be, because I followed the old and correct order that other Narnia readers said was the original order, and it mixed the stories up and confused me.	2000-11-07

This is a very good &quot;Dear America&quot; and is quite informative on the beginnings of the Civil War. It is &quot;written&quot; by Amelia Martin, who lives in Fenwick Island, Delaware, a state divided right in half because of the troubles of Civil War. Aside from being a teacher at the nearby schoolhouse she is a Lighthouse keeper and proud of it, and the hard work makes her strongly built and not the feminine lady her mother wants her to be. Amelia is lonely for much of the first part of the book and has only the cat, Napoleon, and her beloved diary for company, but later gets the happy company of Keeper Hale and his family. In Delaware one half believes in slavery while the other is pro-Lincoln and the division goes even as far as married couples, like Amelia's parents. Their marital troubles unfold realistically, just like a real relationship. Unfortunately they are not able to resolve their problems. I enjoy the way Amelia's diary was written and the characters were well-written about and easy to believe in.	2000-11-07

At first I'd thought this book was another of those fancy-schmancy, dragging novels, but I found myself thoroughly enjoying reading about Anne Shirley of Green Gables. It is about how a young orphan girl finds a home at Green Gables in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island. Each chapter is like a short story. They are funny when Anne is younger, like the episode when she dyed her hair green :), but as she grows older they start to deal more with her education, and, near the end of the book, depressing subjects like death and of the possible loss of Anne losing her beloved home, Green Gables. The characters are written about in a way that you can easily become familiar with them. I highly recommend this book.	2000-10-24

This would be a good book for readers who are not so advanced yet, because here you don't have to worry about difficult words. It's also funny and the pictures were a great addition to the book. It really stuck to the  &quot;My Life as a Writer&quot; part of the title, because it just says how  R.L. Stine has been writing all his life, from little comics to magazines  and finally to books, and the rest of it, which wasn't all that much, was  about his family. This is the perfect book I know about that will help fans  learn about R.L. Stine, so I suggest you read it and see what you think.	2000-07-03

What I  can't understand also is that how come Joshua Leonard has appeared on TV  for things like movie awards and other stuff that stars go to, when he's  supposed to have disappeared? I know I'm not mistaken about seeing Josh on  TV. The book is really good if you want to scare yourself, or maybe even  some friends.

I did not like the way the book was written. It  was confusing and lacked detail. It was pretty unrealistic when it came to  students with mixed races. I myself go to an international school, although  not quite as international as LIA (the school Laura and Billy went to), and  you have friends no matter what country you're from, and nobody criticizes  you the way the kids criticized each other in this book. I didn't much  enjoy this at all, and I'm not exactly planning to buy any more of Ms.  Cooney's books if all of them are going to be written in the same weird  style.	2000-05-19

I do that only when a book really captures my interest. I can't believe how good Phyllis Naylor is at writing like she's a real teen! Only one very small problem here.  Naylor stressed the &quot;in-between&quot; thing too much, which might have  been what the book was supposed to be, but I am also in &quot;the summer  between seventh and eighth grades&quot; and I don't worry much about my  age. Naylor was very good at keeping me amused enough to read the whole  book, especially the part in the Amtrak going to Chicago, the experience  with Bill Donovan. That was a realistic part. (It's still Pamela's fault  that she's too much of a flirt sometimes.) Any Alice fan would want to read  this book and it's practically a guarantee that you'll enjoy it.	2000-04-09

I don't think &quot;The Beach&quot; is too slow a novel, as one  customer wrote in their review, but I do have to admit that parts of it,  especially one part towards the end, made me lose my interest. I don't  understand, though, why the people want to live permanently on a little  island. I don't understand what it is with Mr. Duck. Is he dead and just in  Richard's imagination, a spirit? Did some of the events in this book have  hidden meanings in them, like Sten being killed, the phosphorescence? I  like the unique way, though, that Garland kept the book long but almost  completely interesting. That's certainly a talent not many people are  gifted with. I'm a little challenged with how to write a review for such a  complex book. This is a confusing yet really good book, and if you don't  mind long novels, you really really ought to read this one.	2000-04-09

Okay...Hattie's diary is the fourth Dear America I've read, and it's about as good as Lucinda Lawrence's diary. The Oregon Trail itself does not sound  so interesting---just, in summary, pioneers traveling from the east of the  United States to Oregon, in the west. But the way Kristiana Gregory/Hattie  wrote it was interesting enough to make me hardly put the book down. I  enjoyed the detailed way Hattie wrote about going across the Oregon Trail,  and although the deaths of the pioneers were sad, they were told well  enough that it didn't seem like, &quot;Oh, big deal, just some other  pioneer died,&quot; like how it was in Remember Patience Whipple's diary. I  also liked the way the epilogue went, but if I say it here I might ruin it  for people who haven't read the book yet, so I won't. Anyway this is simply  a must-read for all Dear America fans, and for other readers too.	2000-02-28

The only teeny problem is sometimes I can't understand stuff Anne says, like I have to read the lines again to understand. When I first picked up the book, which  I borrowed from my best friend, I read for an hour straight. When you start  reading this book you can barely stop, so I suggest you get a copy of this  book and start reading. I can relate a lot to the way Anne feels---imagine  being locked up for two years in a place like the &quot;Secret  Annexe&quot;, not being able to go out just because of your religion, and  hardly being able to enjoy things you should rightfully be able to. Not too  good for young readers, 'cause they might have a hard time understanding  stuff about the war, and the book contains some material that's not best  for young kids.	2000-02-12

When I was just starting to read the book my opinion on it was the same that I have on &quot;A Journey to the New  World&quot; (check my review there for details), but later on the book got  better so I decided to give it a higher rating than I originally planned. I  don't understand why the author didn't say anything about Sally and Johnny  (Abby's little sister and brother) in the diary's epilogue, so I think that  part should've been different. What I like best about Dear America books is  that they give you a good idea of how life was like in that particular  period in American history, which I don't learn too much about because I  live in the Philippines. This book and the diary of Mem Whipple were the  only two Dear America books that I've read and so far the books aren't  excellent. I hope the next Dear America book I'm planning to read, the  diary of Lucinda Lawrence, will be better than this and Mem Whipple's  diary.	2000-01-13

It's a great book and I think it's a  good book for anyone who can read.	2000-01-13

I would have given it 5 stars, but sometimes the story gets a little boring. This book will be best for people who like fairy tales with characters such as centaurs and witches (NOT the Blair Witch kind!), etc. I highly suggest you read this book. It's not very  interesting at first, but then it gets better. You need some patience with  this book but it really is good. Oh I don't like it also that Harper Trophy  didn't print the books in the right order.	2000-01-04

I mean, it definitely gave me a good idea of how things were back then, but it was just boring for me most of the time. Nothing really happened except that a lot of the Pilgrims  died. It's not deathly boring, though, so I suggest you give the book a  try. Everyone else has been saying this is a good book, but I hope my  review is helpful to some readers.	2000-01-04
