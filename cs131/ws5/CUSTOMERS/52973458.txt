I've read all of his novels and enjoyed them. This just doesn't rank with \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland,\\" \\"A Wild Sheep Chase,\\" or \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicles.\\" Still, it was a fun read. Most enjoyable characters: Mr. Nakata and Mr. Hoshino. Both characters were a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Nakata's conversations with the cats. In the end, it was a light, enjoyable breeze of a read, and not nearly so haunting as, \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland,\\" or \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicles.\\"	2005-05-10

Gradually, things grow tamer and more whimsical, until the story is muddled and meandering.  The ending leaves too many things unresolved.  I found that the first half of the book was intriguing.  Kim was a murderer, and he draws Lynn in.  This alone lends him a certain dark mystique. The rest of the book seems to be an attempt to justify his crime, when no justification is required.  (or even desired!)  The lyric richness of the novel is what saves it. Ms. Neimark's descriptions and style are like elegant poetry with the occasional stunning twist.	1997-11-19

Deeply Profound and Spiritual	Rumi's poetry touches Soul in Its deepest recesses, reminding us of the value of silence, of contemplation, and of seeking God within ourselves.  Sprinkled throughout his poetry, is a liberal dash of Light and Sound, the two manifestations of God's voice on Earth.  We too can contact these two aspects of God, and almost magically, Rumi's poems all fall into place.  This book is more than a book of poems.  It is something akin to a map, detailing one man's spiritual journey into the Heart of God, and then back into society, to live amongst the &quot;sleeping.&quot; Shams of Tabriz makes a few appearances in the writings of Eckankar, as well as in this book, and filled me with excitement as my eye fell upon his name.  For those interested in the Light and Sound of God, check out this site:  [...]   My congratulations and thanks go out to Coleman Barks as well, for capturing the lyric magic and the musical spirituality that fills Rumi's works.

I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage.  M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of &quot;getting by.&quot;  Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life.  &quot;Effect&quot; instead of &quot;Cause.&quot;  The story begins with a death, and ends with a death.  In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's &quot;fiancee&quot; or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes.  Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon.  Be &quot;Cause.&quot;  Not &quot;Effect.&quot;  Get out and LIVE.  Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply &quot;getting by.&quot	1997-05-16

Upon reading this book, one wonders why Orientals are praised in numerous passages as metaphysical &quot;self-questing&quot; masters, (Yoda?)and in as many places, Europeans and Westerners are referred to as catagorically &quot;ignorant.&quot;  Once one moves beyond these condescending and culturally myopic statements, the book contains much useful information.  By the way, Bonsai is an art that is dying out in Japan, and there are few, if any, young people who care anything about it, much less respect it as an art form.  Having lived all over Japan during the ten years that I was there, I am of the opinion that young Japanese people are as ignorant of their own culture as the authors claim Americans and Europeans are.  And actually, the Americans and Europeans that I came into contact with knew more about Japanese history, customs and culture than the Japanese themselves.  Might I suggest sticking to the topic of Bonsai and leaving your reversed cultural biases out of print	1997-05-08

However, Feng Shui is presented in a somewhat biased manner, as a cure-all for healing lives.  Certainly, our environments can be places of healing and nurturing energy, but the bottom line is personal preference and common sense. (in life, as well as interior decorating!) Each person has their own likes and dislikes.  For example, many people enjoy having high ceilings and an open floor-plan, while others prefer more &quot;yin&quot; environments, with lower ceilings and dimmer, smaller rooms.  Socrates said most wisely, &quot;All things in moderation.&quot;  I still believe that Feng Shui needs more westernization for it to be practical, useful, and accessible to the average American or European	1997-05-08

Picturesque, dark, with much of the same melancholy as &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; and told in the same offhand style.  Murakami is a novelist with the heart and style of a poet, and the dry wit of a satirist.

When Dr. Deming first began speaking in America, America was still riding along on the post-war victory wave.  No one would listen to him.

Robert Monroe writes with a style that is informative without being &quot;preachy.&quot;  His wit, objectivity, and scientific approach adds to his credibility, and further makes the book exciting and enjoyable.

I grew up in a hellfire and brimstonechurch, where God's wrath was emphasized, and I heard the message &quot;God is love&quot; only twice in a sixteen year timespan.

And yes, God is &quot;IT,&quot; not a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;she.&quot; What use does a spiritual being have for gender? My congratulations to Mr. Walsch on having the courage and the willingness to be an instrument of Divine Love, and my congratulations to him for being willing to usher in a higher level of consciousness.
