(I have never seen it happen.) It seems to me, as a mother of a son, that MANY more boys are harmed by being forced into rigid stereotypes of how boys \\"should\\" be, rather than letting them be their authentic selves whether or not that conforms to traditional gender norms. But Gurian seems to think that enforcing these gender norms is not a problem, because that is what ALL boys are like. Ha! Not so, in my experience.  <br /> <br />In general, I was annoyed by his sweeping overgeneralizations (assuming that every boy is the typical boy, and every girl is the typical girl)--I was not surprised to see he endorsed John Gray's Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus books (the least useful of many relationship books I have read over the years--although I am a woman, I have a lot more of the \\"Martian\\" traits than the \\"Venusian\\" ones.) <br /> <br />His parenting advice for the most part is just common sense, and would apply equally well to raising girls. <br /> <br />If you have a typical boy, and for some reason don't feel comfortable with that, maybe you will find this book reassuring. Otherwise I would suggest The Courage to Raise Good Men by Olga Silverstein and Beth Rashbaum instead.	2005-03-09

She explains why it is inevitable that parents will be incredibly stressed out, not through any fault of their own but just because children have so many needs which their parents have to meet regardless of how busy or exhausted they are. This is a message I could have used in the first six months of motherhood, when I felt guilty about secretly wanting to get away from my baby for a month or so, despite loving him with all my heart.<br />_Brat_ goes into extensive detail about the challenges of childrearing, and for that reason I would recommend it to people who are trying to make the parenting decision--especially those who have no compelling desire to have kids but are being pressured by others. However, this focus on the difficulties of parenting also can be pretty depressing to those of us who are parents. After being reminded of the inevitable losses that being a parent brings, I was starting to feel resentful of my 2-year-old son--though fortunately I was soon able to quash that by focussing on the good things that motherhood has brought. I wish that Jeffers had given much more information to help those of us who already are parents cope, rather than just a brief &quot;survival guide&quot; which appears as an addendum at the end of the book. While I agree with some of her suggestions (get fathers more involved, get a life outside of raising your kids), I find that her suggestion that employment outside the home is better than stay-at-home motherhood is overly simplistic. If, as she alleges, SAHM's can't get out because it is too difficult to gather up the baby's stuff and get baby dressed, how is it possible for her to do so to cart the baby off to daycare on the way to work? If caring for one child is too exhausting to cope with for any period of time (over an hour she suggests at one point!) why does she not have even more concern about daycare employees coping with a number of children all day? If SAHM's have &quot;no&quot; time for their own interests or even to wash their hair, how will adding the responsibilities of full-time employment help? I was also concerned that she sometimes claims that some children are inherently &quot;bad&quot;. This kind of thinking does not lend itself to finding constructive solutions to problems with a child's behaviour. And what does it do to a child to be written off like this by hir own parent? For coping with the challenges of parenting, I have found the following books helpful: Parenting the Fussy Baby and High Needs Child by Martha and William Sears (check out chapter on avoiding burnout), Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka, and All Mothers Work by Cindy Ramming (on the pros and cons of being a SAHM, and how to cope with SAHMhood if that is what's right for you).	2000-12-17

The trouble-making Cat in the Hat is transformed into a bland voice of authority lecturing about the importance of sharing. Evidently the authors haven't read &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, or they would know that the Grinch reformed at the end and is not the incorrigible villain he is depicted as in this book. Even the artwork is not a convincing imitation of Seuss, lacking the bold black ink strokes and wild details. The new characters in the book, Megan Mullally and her grandfather, look like Muppets rather than Seuss characters.<br />Get a *real* Dr. Seuss book.	2000-11-17

Her expertise on sheepdogs allows her to create a rich and complex character in Moss, the sheepdog of the title. However, the &quot;animal rights&quot; characters are poorly developed, inconsistent, and unbelieveable. Her contempt for animal rights activists is obvious: in this book, they are uniformly stupid, impulsive, hypocritical (most of them eat meat!), and unethical (compelling a child to engage in illegal activities). At one point, Levin suggests that Jody's mother was &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the other activists.<br />I have never heard of any animal rights activists being concerned about the plight of sheepdogs, but after reading this book, I wonder if maybe there is cause for concern. Why is Levin so hostile and defensive? Her unrealistic depiction of animal activists leads me to wonder if Moss's yearning to return to his work as a sheepdog is pure invention as well.	2000-11-11

Delving into Mengele's past, as an endearing child known as &quot;Beppo&quot;, and his life after the war (unrepetant to the end) the authors have created a fascinating portrait of this complex, twisted man. Juxtaposed with Mengele's story are the stories of the few twins who survived the experiments at Auschwitz. I found it especially poignant to see the contrast between Mengele's relatively easy life after the war--he used his family's wealth to start a successful business in South America and hobnobbed with other members of the South American Nazi &quot;elite&quot;, and the lives of the twins after the war--most of them lost their families and lived in severe poverty, as well as being haunted throughout their lives by the horrors they suffered at Auschwitz. Highly recommended.	2000-11-09

She finds she is so busy with Brett that she has less and less time for her activism--and then Brett pressures her to give up her animal rights work altogether because he is concerned for her safety.<br />The dilemma Chloe faces will be familiar to many vegetarian women; indeed, many girls and women period. It is inevitable that relationships change us, but how much change is too much?<br />Unlike many books of the genre, the book does not have a simplistic happily ever after ending. Chloe's problems, including the tension between Brett and her beliefs, her relationship with her (noncustodial) mother, her faltering friendship with a fellow activist, and her grandmother who suffers from dementia, are not magically solved. What we do get is a realistic, bittersweet ending, with some hope for the future.	2000-11-09

Having had two failed marriages, I have read numerous books on relationships looking for answers. _Loving_Him_without_Losing_You_ has given me not only a much greater insight into why I have had such problems  with men, but has also given me hope that the future can be very  different.<br />Engel speaks to almost every woman, for almost no one has  managed to escape the usual relationship &quot;wisdom&quot; in our culture  of women &quot;adapting&quot; to meet their men's needs (by hiding  accomplishments, giving up interests and friends if &quot;he&quot; doesn't  like them, etc.). Engels gives us another, healthier way to build  relationships, by staying true to our authentic selves. Ironically, this  advice which is so contrary to what most of us learned is the *only* way to  have a truly satisfying relationship--more satisfying for the man as well  as the woman--as Engel convincingly argues.<br />Numerous exercises throughout  the book help the reader discover her patterns, uncover issues from the  past and work through them, and discover her authentic self. Engel also  gives valuable information on creating a women's circle or support group,  and finding a therapist if necessary.<br />A compassionate, intelligent,  inspiring book. Read it! Buy it!

I read this book looking for specific advice on dealing with the unique challenges of remarriage--how to keep ghosts from the previous marriage(s) from intruding, meeting the needs of children from your previous marriage  as well as those of the new husbands, building a strong step-family.  Instead _Marrying_Again_ gives the same old superficial manipulative advice  you would find in a magazine article--figure out what he wants and then  become that person. They take it to ridiculous extremes--suggesting hiding  your kids if he doesn't like kids (what happens if you marry him! ) or, if  you don't have kids and he likes them, *borrowing* someone else's kids! It  reminded me of a Lynda Barry cartoon spoof on relationship  advice--&quot;Giving up your 'real' personality is a small price to pay for  a relationship with an actual man!&quot;<br />Later on in the book, they  discuss changing the man to suit your needs as well, demeaningly describing  incompatible men as &quot;fixer-uppers&quot; and detailing how to  manipulate them into giving up their real personalities too.<br />If you  follow this advice, you could very well be remarried very soon.  Unfortunately, it will be a marriage where you will have to hid your real  self, and so will he. In other words, a marriage that will make you  miserable and lead to another divorce.<br />I am still looking for a good book  on remarriage. One book I can recommend on man-woman relationships in  general is _Loving_Him_without_Losing_You_ by Beverly Engels. Follow her  advice to create a healthy relationship between two real people expressing  their real personalities--the only basis for a real marriage.	2000-07-26

Although I was initially skeptical about whether I would learn anything new, I was pleased to find that Eisman covers many topics to a far greater  depth than I have seen in other vegetarian books.<br />The Basic Course in  Vegetarian and Vegan Nutrition will answer virtually any question you can  think of on the subject. Not only is the course comprehensive, but Eisman  has explained things in a readable and easy-to-understand way. Topics  covered include carbs, fibre, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, digestion  and absoption, vegetarian foods, diet-related chronic disease, and  vegetarianism throughout the life cycle. After completing the course, you  will be able to respond to questions not only from family and friends but  even from (less informed) health professionals (informed health  professionals will not question a balanced vegan diet).<br />As a registered  dietician and practicing vegan, Eisman is eminently qualified to write this  authoritative work, in an intelligent way without any of the flaky or  sensationalistic overtones found in some other books. Definitely a  worthwhile investment of your time and money!	2000-07-17

Victor's heroism is inspiring and teaches children that their actions can make a difference. The illustrations are cute but as another reviewer  mentioned reinforce gender stereotypes. Also, Victor's parents' ready  acceptance of his decision to stop eating meat seems pretty unrealistic,  especially given that their livelihood depends on raising animals for  slaughter. Meat-eating kids may be disappointed to find that their parents  offer more resistance. However, these drawbacks do not affect my 2 year  old's enjoyment of the book in the least, and the message of becoming  vegetarian for compassionate reasons shines through.	2000-07-16

The family uses a &quot;school at home&quot; approach complete with tedious homework, regular testing, and pressure to work. The parents stay up late into the night developing lessons, planning curriculum, and assessing their daughters' progress. And the mother has a masters degree in education! While that's not a bad thing, overall this book could give the impression that homeschooling can only work for highly educated superparents. I prefer I am a Home Schooler by Julie Voetberg which to me sets a more appealing and approachable example of homeschooling.	2000-07-16

In fact,  when people asked why I don't use dairy products, I would mumble something  vague, so lost in my other worries had my veganism  become.<br />_The_Vegan_Sourcebook_ has got me feeling inspired again. In an  intelligent, compassionate way, she neatly summarizes all of the problems  with animal products--the cruelties done to the animals, the environmental  devastation, the oppression of the human workers on factory farms and in  slaughterhouses (a subject omitted from many other vegan books), and the  damage to health. Not only does she discuss the negatives of animal  products, she emphasizes the positives of veganism, with inspiring quotes  from a diverse array of vegans which really humanize the vegan  movement.<br />The nutrition section by Virginia Messina is positive but  realistic, with all the information you need to plan a sound vegan diet for  yourself and your family (though I would have prefered more emphasis on the  importance of breastfeeding). This is a book that vegans will want to refer  to again and again, and show to their nonvegan family members, friends, and  health professionals.	2000-07-16

Most of the recipes use &quot;normal&quot; ingredients; less  familiar ingredients are explained in a glossary.

Instead, 90% of the essays are Pagan, with a couple of Buddhist ones and one Jewish essay. I  don't have anything against Paganism, but it is not my path, it just  doesn't move my spirit. There is some good stuff in here, but I found there  was too much emphasis on externals, such as rituals for different occasions  and Tarot cards, and not enough on the day-to-day inner work of parenting.  Also, Carson's dig at stay-at-home mothers (&quot;studies have shown that  most housewives actually spend more time watching television than they  spend with their children&quot;) was unexpected and uncalled for in a book  on spiritual parenting. For many, staying at home with their children and  accepting the sacrifices involved is an important part of their spiritual  path. Finally, Carson has included an excellent section on the spirituality  of biological motherhood, but has not given equal time to fathers and  adoptive parents, who have different paths with equal beauty and  significance.	2000-07-09

For me, the most valuable part of the  book was the extensive collection of parents' stories and photographs of  healthy, happy children. Dr. Klaper provides not only helpful food guides  (to replace the omnivorous &quot;4 Food Groups&quot;) but also details food  sources of nutrients which may be of greater concern to vegans (protein,  iron, calcium, B12). I would have liked to see a discussion of how to cope  with &quot;morning&quot; sickness (for me it lasted all day) and finicky  toddlers. Why do books for omnivores say &quot;don't worry if all you eat  is soda crackers for the first trimester&quot; or &quot;don't worry if your  toddler eats nothing but Cheerios for a week&quot; but books for vegans  make it seem like we must always eat a widely varied, perfectly balanced  diet? Because this is an older book, some of the advice (e.g.  breastfeeding, use of juices, introduction of solids) does not reflect  current knowledge. This book is still definitely worth having on hand, but  I would suggest supplementing it with the more recent _Becoming_Vegetarian_  by Vesanto Melina et al. Thanks to Dr. Klaper's encouragement, I resisted  pressure to feed my baby meat. He is now a tall, intelligent, healthy,  sturdy, lively, loveable two-year-old, and vegan!	2000-07-09

Jackson's research is compelling, and got me started on the road to attachment parenting--something I'll always be  greatful for. However, after my son arrived I found that things were much  more difficult than Three In A Bed had led me to believe. Jackson's baby  had an easy temperament, and she attributed this to her parenting style. I  was expecting an easy baby too, but instead my wonderful son has a high  needs temperament, with frequent waking and nursing, intense emotional  reactions, etc. I was not prepared for the level of sleep deprivation I  faced, as Three In A Bed had led me to believe that I could avoid all that.  It's great that Jackson and many other moms could sleep through nursing,  but I cannot usually do so. Also, in her question and answer section, she  claims that if a baby co-sleeps from birth, there will be no problems with  wriggling, kicking the parents, etc.--again, not true for high needs  babies. Despite these problems, I still think that sharing sleep is the way  to go, and this book is definitely worth reading. However, if your child  has a high needs temperament, also read Parenting the Fussy Baby and High  Needs Child by William and Martha Sears, which also advocates sharing sleep  but does not claim it is a panacea.	2000-06-15

Cindy Ramming has been both a stay-at-home mom and a working-outside-the-home mom, and knows  whereof she speaks. Her informal, intimate, and humorous style makes this  book a quick read. The first half of the book helps the reader decide if  staying at home is for her, the second half has practical supportive advice  for those who do decide to &quot;stay at home&quot; (including a key  secret--to be a successful &quot;stay at home&quot; mom, you need to get  out of the house!). Unlike so many books for mothers which create idealized  perfectionistic standards, All Mothers Work is realistic and  supportive--Rammings admits some of her own foibles, too, which we can all  identify with. The only reason I gave the book 4 instead of 5 stars was  that it was shorter than I would have liked.	2000-06-14

Whilethere is some good parenting information, there are also some serious problems. Brott clearly isn't completely over his divorce yet. Little digs against mothers crop up even when he is discussing unrelated topics (for example, when he is discussing becoming a stepfather, he feels compelled to claim that mothers are more likely to abuse children than are stepfathers (he gives no reference to back up this bizarre claim). He condemns giving the mother sole or primary custody for various reasons, but supports *fathers* getting sole or primary custody--in his discussions of custody, he fails to focus on the children's best interests, but instead emphasizes the father's rights. Ditto his discussion of child support--he seems to think that mothers use child support payments to indulge themselves, without considering that adequate child support is what is the children's best interest. Furthermore, his proposed visitation schedules for breastfeeding infants are ludicrous--for example, for a one month old, breastfed, he suggests at least 3 hours a day, plus 8 to 12 hours on the weekends--a schedule that is highly likely to prevent breastfeeding from being successfully established. He also claims that extended breastfeeding (past 1 year) is merely a ploy to interfere with the father's relationship with the child. He also suggests giving &quot;tastes&quot; of food to very young babies (newborn to 6 months), apparently unaware that early introduction of solids can increase the risk of allergies developing. One good thing about this book is that he has included lots of information for gay fathers throughout, but I suspect that there are other books for gay fathers which do not have the problems of this book. I decided not to recommend this book to my son's fathers. Instead, I gave him a copy of _Helping_Your_Kids_Cope_With_Divorce_the_Sandcastles_Way_, which includes a wealth of balanced, compassionate, realistic advice for divorced parents of both genders.	2000-06-14

I therefore eagerly ordered this  book.<br />I was sorely disappointed to find that Harvest of Shame consists  almost entirely of old information recycled from other antivivisectionist  books. Furthermore, the style, while poetic and passionate, also rambled  quite a bit.<br />If you want to learn more about vivisection, I'd suggest  either the &quot;classics&quot; I mentioned above, or better, for the  technically inclined, go to the scientific journals and see for yourself  how cruel and pointless modern vivisection really is.	2000-06-11

Unfortunately, this bookisn't it. Robin's &quot;research&quot; seems to have consisted primarily of hanging out on the Internet. It seems she believed everything that bottlefeeding moms said, and nothing breastfeeding moms said. It's surprising and disappointing that the publisher did not insist on running a book of this nature by a medical advisor, since Robin has no medical qualifications. Any medical expert would have spotted a number of factual errors in the book, such as the claim that weaning from the breast is necessary to treat diarrhea and vomitting (in fact, frequent breastfeeding is helpful under such circumstances, reducing the danger of dehydration). Furthermore, she attacks attachment parenting, vegetarianism, and numerous other parenting decisions which are separate from breastfeeding. What about the attachment parenting, vegetarian mom who is not able to breastfeed? She won't find support here, only insults...	2000-06-11

Her &quot;references&quot; are newpaper articles and other sources in the popular media. She attacks views she disagrees with as  being backed up with sloppy research done by people with a specific agenda  to push, but she uses the same kinds of arguments to support her views.  Furthermore, I was stunned to see that she advocates hitting children  (spanking) as an important and effective form of discipline. If you're  looking for a book in defence of stay-at-home parents, I suggest Being  There by Isabelle Fox instead.	2000-06-02

Although I liked their pregnancy book, What to Expect When You're Expecting, I really disliked this book. First of all, a month-by-month format is unrealistic for infant development. &quot;Normal&quot;  development in infants varies a great deal--you CANNOT predict what will  happen in a specific month. If your baby (like most) does not follow their  month-by-month timetable, you can end up worrying for no reason (a baby who  hits a milestone early has NO longterm advantage over one who hits a  milestone late). Furthermore, the authors have very definite ideas that  babies should be left to cry it out, even suggesting soundproofing the  nursery. They say that you should not try to comfort your teething baby who  is crying piteously in the night, and if you do they suggest you are being  foolish. I prefer Sears and Sears' Parenting the Fussy Baby and High Needs  Child, and The Baby Book, for information on infant care--the high needs  book is especially reassuring, and also includes a critical chapter on  avoiding mother burnout.	2000-06-02

It includes a wealth of information, in a depth rarely found in popular parenting books. As a single mom, I appreciated that the authors do not assume that everyone has the &quot;ideal&quot; two-parent middle class WASP  family. However, although the book's subtitle says that it is for the first  five years, I find some of its advice on infant care questionable. They  think it is okay to let your baby cry to learn independence, if it agrees  with the parents' values. They also wrongly claim that &quot;...some  children never lose interest in nursing...&quot; and advocate adult-led  weaning. Buy this book for helpful information about your toddler and  preschooler, but for babies, see the books by Martha and William Sears (The  Baby Book, Parenting the Fussy Baby and High Need Child, The Discipline  Book) for a more sensitive approach.	2000-04-05

Moran investigates the history and modern day practice of ethical veganism, based firmly in compassion for all sentient life. People who are  put off by the angry tone of some animal rights literature will find this  book a welcome change: gentle, without compromising the animals' interests.  Deservedly a classic.	2000-03-28

They suggest that people who always respond to their babies' cries are softhearted fools.  Instead, they suggest ignoring the baby who is crying with teething pain in  the middle of the night, and suggest that if you have a baby who cries a  lot you should invest in soundproofing. Some of the information on  breastfeeding is dangerously misleading, e.g. the suggestion that mothers  limit the amount of time babies spend nursing in the first days. Following  this advice is likely to lead to problems establishing a good milk supply,  according to lactation consultants and the experts at La Leche League. They  also advocate early weaning, saying 3 months is a good age because it's  easy to wean then, and for sure you should wean by one year. In addition,  suggesting that you can expect certain behaviour at a specific age, in  months, is ludicrous! Babies vary enormously in their rates of development,  and this kind of month-by-month predictions can cause a lot of anxiety.	2000-03-28
US	49813139	R1UM20HW1A2BGS	0679778012	436525491	Helping Your Kids Cope with Divorce the Sandcastles Way	Books	5	87	89	N	N	Helpful, sensitive advice for fathers and mothers	I have read a number of books for divorcing parents, and this is by far the best. The range of information given is enormous (460 pages!) and covers almost any situation you can imagine. This is the ONLY book I have seen that discusses how to help infants cope with divorce. Neuman's  discussion of the needs of children has given me the motivation to avoid  fighting with my ex, even when he makes extremely aggravating remarks. His  suggestions have also helped me keep my son's father involved; in fact, he  spends much more time with our son than he ever did when we were married.  The example dialogues are very helpful, and reflect the diversity of real  families. Neuman is careful to avoid stereotypes, for example he gives  anecdotes about deadbeat moms as well as deadbeat dads.	2000-03-26
