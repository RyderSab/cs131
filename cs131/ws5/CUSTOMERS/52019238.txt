What I particularly enjoy abut Rice's work is the ability with which she writes children. Both &quot;Blue Moon&quot; and &quot;Perfect Summer&quot; enmesh bright, sensitive, intelligent kids into the stories and Rice definitely shows that she has a grasp on the adolescent mind. I've got some back reading to do to catch up with this author!	2003-09-20

Faith's life takes a huge turn when she finds out that her husband [prefers men], and the revelation also takes a toll on her two children. Luckily, Faith's parents have a row house that she moves into and renovates with the help of the mysterious and oddly \\"available\\" Pavel Quinn (is it just me, or is the name \\"Quinn\\" popping up a lot in contemporary novels?). The emotional strength of Faith's character is written well, and I like how Richards teases us with potentially ghastly clues that end up being fun (such as the \\"Ghost\\" family in the attic). <br />Remy's fall by the wayside into a potentially disastrous situation was an important essay in itself - as was the outcome of her involvement with the older boy. I like Richards' style.	2003-09-20

While Roberts romanticizes the southern Irish city of Cobh, she unfairly portrayed Prague as a dreg city from which one would long to escape and never return. She did a good job portraying Irish-English dialog, but fell short with her Czech. The only Czech word in the book is \\"Praha,\\" which is Czech for Prague. Nowhere else in the book does she include any Czech words, tribulations that the American exotic dancer Cleo may have gone through to learn the language, her reaction to the sound of the language, or hints about the Czech culture except that Prague has an area that is teeming with strip clubs (as does every major European city). An uninformed reader might think that Czechs don't even have their own language. Homework, Ms. Roberts! A little \\"jak se m, dobre\\" would have been a nice touch here. And I wonder how many readers know that \\"Cobh\\" is pronounced as \\"Cove\\"? Nowhere do we read this in the book. Other than that, of course, I found it an exciting read. Despite the opinions of other reviewers, I thought the story had just the right amount of character development, especially for the villianess Anita.	2003-06-02

While Tilda and Davy were presumably the main characters, I enjoyed the way Crusie shifts the point of view so that we get to know Gwen, Eve/Louise, Thomas, Simon, Mason, Clea, dear Steve, and especially Nadine (and poor Kyle!). Crusie's own wittiness shows through when Davy's nicknames for Tilda leak over into the dialog syntax, ie, when Davy calls her Vilma, her next piece of dialog is followed by &quot;said Vilma.&quot; These little touches combined with a wonderfully convoluted storyline made this my favorite read of the year so far. A real hilarious page turner, especially at the very end.	2003-05-21

It is the first of Catherine Anderson's books I've read and I'm definintely going to become a regular of hers. I loved Chloe's strength of character and the fact that she's believable, in a believable clerical position as a dispatcher. I could also readily identify with the Christmas store and Chloe's delight with the business. Her problems with Bobby Lee definitely raised the anxiety level of the plot, considering what side of the law he was on. His cunning, devious break in and the transmission to the dispatcher were both terrifying and believable. Ms. Anderson writes well and certainly knows how to envoke passion in her readers. The intimatacy between Chloe and Ben was just plain HOT. Wow!	2003-05-05

Her writing style is starkly and humorously descriptive. An example is when one of Joe's children hands Suzanne his toy airplane and &quot;she reacted as though he'd handed her a large insect.&quot; Perfect! Wonderful. I can both see and feel that reaction. Just what I want from an author. Good story, not too sappy, not really that predictable, a little non-believable in parts, but an overall good read. I didn't realize this was a sequel and I'm glad I didn't. I like the mystery surrounding Suzanne and Joe.	2003-05-04

I was ready for some light reading, but how could I get into a story told through letters, notes, journal entries, clippings, and (how refreshing!) email? Well what a surprise I got. And what a fun re-cap of events of the latter half of the 1900s! <br />The book was quite engaging, and although too fast a read (character development somewhat jeopardized), it was unique. To the reviewer who complained about it's predictability, I'm going to counter with the assumption that the predictability was not distracting, but entirely intentional. We were supposed to know what was going to happen. Readers can appreciate the characters' innocence of the future - the events that we know in our past. And Ms. Macomber did a wonderful job of achieving this paradox. I will be reading more from her.	2003-05-04

It's a good murder mystery with plenty of surprises and pretty darned hot in places (oh my!). I had a difficult time grasping Casey's character, though, and her relationship with her mother once she's out of the asylum. And why, after cutting herself with glass chards obviously put in her body lotion on purpose, would she stay in that environment? A previous reviewer is correct. Someone abused, institutionalized, and drugged for so many years would not be able to cope well in this paranoia-inducing situation as well as Casey did. <br />Well written, morose in places, but at least Casey wasn't digging up horse bones (I'm still not over Kentucky Sunrise).	2003-05-04

Von Wormer's style has matured since her first books (although she still uses &quot;and so&quot; on occasion - aargh!) and she still keeps me on the edge. This one is action and romance packed, that's for sure. However, I think Sally Harrington has run her course. Her priorities are not that well-defined and what I did see, I wasn't crazy about.

Not until a bunch of my friends invited me out to see the Harry Potter movie did I consider reading the Potter books. But as so many before me have written, once I picked up the book I found it hard to put down. When I finished it, I started counting the minutes until it was time to head for the movie theater!<br />Rowling's strongest credit is her imagination, of course, which is closely seconded by her writing style and character development. The physical descriptions and character summaries are so vivid that it's no wonder the movie so closely follows the book - she made that happen with her writing style. Even the snake in the zoo has a unique Rowling-given personality.<br />I fell in love instantly with Harry, and my mother instincts took over on Page One. The treatment he got on Privet Drive broke my heart, but the feelings warmed over when Hagrid arrives and continues until Harry first enters Hogwarts. Then when Harry finally \\"sees\\" his parents ... well let's just say I've seen the movie more than once, and read the book as many times.<br />I wish I could give Rowling herself twenty stars for this book, and for the others to come. For a first-time author, she's amazing and richly deserves all the good things her writings will bring her. She gave me back my own imagination. I want to be young again and grow up as a Hogwarts Witch!	2002-01-31

I read this book while on vacation and blew a whole day of sight-shopping in Europe in favor of finding out if Rafaella ever reveals the identity of her father. This is positively gripping, and even where I thought that the plot went a little too much by the wayside (the prostitute's demise), it ended up being crucial to the story. Fabulous job again by Ms. Coulter, who has convinced me that she's as good in the new century as she was in the three previous ones. :-)	2001-12-08

Unfortunately, I'm reading the books in reverse order but in the process I can appreciate how Van Wormer's style has matured. In her later books, I'm pleased to see that she's gotten over her distracting use of &quot;and so&quot; (ie, &quot;This happened, and so that happened.&quot;). The story is interesting, though. It starts with the shooting of anchorwoman Alexandra Waring and her recovery and exodus to the upstart network, DBS. We're also indroduced to Jessica Wright, and see her through her alcohol problems and subsequent recovery. The likely romance between Cassy and Jackson begins, and by the end of the book DBS is solidly established. It's a good story that held my interest, but so much of it was extraneous to the plot and cumbersome with detail. I did some skimming through certain parts, like the blow-by-blow account of Alexandra getting dressed to go out jogging. However, you'll definitely need to read this one to enjoy Talk, Expose, and The Last Lover to their fullest. All three are excellent and got me hooked on Van Wormer's work.	2001-02-11

While Butterfly was a tough act to follow, Stars does its best. granted it doesn't have the gripping plot twists that the first part of the story had but it's got plenty to keep your interest and appease your Beverly/Danny fix. You'll read about Phillippa and her early life in boarding school waiting for her adoptive father who has all but disappeared, and you'll struggle with her as she grows fat and earns the name &quot;Choppy.&quot; And then she sheds the weight and sets out to find her twin sister. No fair reading ahead, but you'll be tempted. And do order both books. They haven't become outdated.	2001-01-22

I read Talk after I read Expose, and now I'm in the process of ordering more of Van Wormer's books. Talk was a great story. I appreciate how Van Wormer develops her characters, and how likeable yet diverse they are. The lead character, for instance, is a recovering alcholic. Her love interest is a possible suspect in the mystery, and &quot;Alexandra Eyes&quot; has her own secrets. When Jessica is kidnapped, she ends up rescuing and helping one of her kidnappers who was badly injured. I didn't feel compassion for him until the end of the book, when the plot comes together. And as for Leopold ... well you'll have to draw your own conclusions. It's an entertaining read. I want more.	2001-01-22
US	52019238	R2FYGMPUH99KG2	0380708353	508683285	Butterfly	Books	5	4	4	N	N	One of my all-time favorites	After a young Danny Mackay made runaway Rachel an underage prostitute and then left her for dead, she's determined to see to it that he gets what he deserves. She gets a job as a short order cook in modest restaurant and draws crowds with her special hamburger recipe. With new self-assurance, she talks a plastic surgeon into reconstructing her unattractive face for free, and returns to make the restaurant turn into a thriving fast food chain. And all this time, she's cutting news clips on Danny Mackay, who becomes a famous evangelist. The ending is gripping. Ten years after I first read it, I still never get tired of reading how the beautiful, rich, and powerful Beverly Highland, once the homely and desperate Rachel, gives Danny Mackay what he's got coming to him. You'll want to read it again and again, and then order &quot;Stars&quot; for the finale.	2001-01-22

Her writing style is light and easy to read - perfect to curl up with during the hectic holidays. Her book Expose was fast paced, and the main character Sally is easy to like. Unlike some other contemporary authors, Van Wormer doesn't bog us down with the main character's beauty and elegance. We get to know Sally through her dialog rather than with a mental image of her physique. That's refreshing! As a writer myself, I could identify with Sally and it's obvious that Van Wormer's spent time in the publishing world. I found the two concurrent plots not always in sync but I was relieved at the end of the book - I'm not putting any plot spoilers here, though! Suffice to say that I want to read more about Sally, Cassy, Alexandra, and the rest. I like Van Wormer's style.	2000-12-26

The book opens with a chilling scene about a staged car wreck that resulted in two people dead and one in a coma. In the hospital, Marla can hear people talking, but why do they claim to be her family? She doesn't remember them, or anything else. They're calling her &quot;Marla&quot; but she has no recollection of that name. For some reason, she whispered the name &quot;Nicholas&quot; - Nick is presumably her brother in law. (After finishing the book, I found this to be a slight inconsistency - hmmm!) Still in her coma, she can also sense a chilling presence. Once she recovers she's thrust into a life she can't remember but does adapt to in order to help solve her tormenting mystery. Who's after her? And why? This was an excellent story, very fast-paced, and made for great Thanksgiving Day reading!	2000-12-01

The Bride Trilogy (Hellion Bride, Heiress Bride, and whatever the first one was) were by far my favorites and  examples of my wanting the stories to continue. With The Countess, I was OK  with the plot but agree that the characters could have been developed  better. I got the best kick out of Andy's relationship with John's horse!  Andy's character does come out with typical Coulter-style dialog which  thankfully never portrays the female lead in the role of  &quot;airhead.&quot; Her heroines are whitty and of strong character and  this was the perfect book for a long plane ride.

There's an interesting summary of the history of Harmony Ball Company followed by a step-by-step (with pictures) rendition of how Harmony Kingdom Treasure Jests are made. I loved reading about all the pieces and their hidden meanings and secrets, each with a lovely full-color photo. The index will help me manage my GROWING Harmony Kindgom collection! Wonderful book, well worth the price.	1999-12-11

As a development engineer and Web page designer for a major telecommunications company (hint: Red Ring), I have ordered MANY copies of HTML: The Definitive Guide for my students. It is, in my opinion, the  finest reference manual in its class. My students seem to agree, as many of  my co-workers sign up for the class just to get the book!<br />Aside from  that, I'm also the author of a series of books about using the Internet for  collecting and I recommend Musciano &amp; Kennedy's book in my own books  (ISBN 1574321129 and 1574321838). If that isn't good testimony for you, I  don't know what is!	1999-12-10

A Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Poorly organized information	I read this two years ago seeking more information about my newly-diagnosed &quot;disorder&quot; and had it not been for the right  meds, I'd have never been able to follow this book. It's for someone who's  already diagnosed. The suggestions for organizing the ADD family are great,  but are they realistic? I don't think so.	1999-10-24

Solden is the first author to identify the TRUE reason why some women grow obsessed with their love interests from the get-go. This is so much easier  to contemplate than those &quot;Women who love to much&quot; or &quot;Men  who can't love&quot; theories. Nope - it's been ADD all along! Solden  writes well. I wish she'd go into more editions with this one. It's needed.	1999-10-24

I wish all reference books were this thorough!&quot; <br />They're not kidding when they say &quot;Busting with  Color.&quot; It also has tables with prices, edition numbers, and the  item's history. I learned more about Toby and Character Jugs that I ever  thought I knew! I plan to spend hours in the American Toby Jug Museum first  chance I get! And the second, and the third, and ...<br />Great book.  Wonderful.	1999-08-31

I used Elizabeth Lyon's model for writing a successful non-fiction book proposal last summer and my book was snapped up by a publisher in less than a month. From the publishers who passed, many sent personalized letters  complimenting the organization of my proposal. Don't submit a non-fiction  proposal without consulting this book. It's EXCELLENT - I should know! See  ISBN 1-57432-112-9 for proof.	1999-07-30
