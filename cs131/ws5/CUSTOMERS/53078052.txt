US	53078052	R3GA36GG65XUC9	1570270392	317643719	Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey & The Postwar Fascist International	Books	4	7	11	N	Y	A very narrow focus	Kevin Coogan has given us something rare:  a sustained, very detailed, very serious examination of a completely obscure, really small topic. <br /> <br />The book is a long biography of someone called Francis Parker Yockey, an American Nazi writer and organizer, who died in 1960 at age 43.  Yockey's big opus \\"Imperium,\\" emulating Spengler and other such writers, was a know-all interpretation of all of history past, present, and especially future.  All very deep.  Yockey's other contribution was his admiring interpretation of Soviet Communism, but only after Yockey judged it to have sufficiently turned against the Jews.  This analysis, again, very sophisticated, very deep. <br /> <br />Yockey also had a knack of quarreling with just about everyone he knew, especially with those who shared his views.  When a fellow Nazi thought that he might not have purely Aryan background, Yockey shot back:  \\"My height is that of Adolf Hitler, my complexion is white ... you will give me satisfaction [at a duel] ... I shall flog you before witnesses. \\"   <br /> <br />Who would care about a nasty crackpot like that ?  Who would spend time researching all the nooks and crannies of that kind of life  ?  Well, Coogan did, and he deserves our thanks, at least moderately so. <br /> <br />Yockey's life could indeed have been a very significant subject if it had been used as an example in a wider study of the Nazi fringe in America.  Coogan gives us precious little of that kind of material. He does tell us something, for example, about the Nazi propagandist Willis Carto.  But Carto's interesting recent  history -- quarrels with other neo-Nazis, etc. -- are not covered.  Coogan is too focused on Yockey to ever tell us much about related persons and grouplets.  A broader focus would have made this book much more valuable. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I am glad that Coogan did all this digging.  At least now we have the goods on one American Nazi, if not the whole phenomenon.	2005-10-13

It is an outstanding event in Jewish history, an outstanding achievement for Israel and its helpers among the Jews of the world.    This book tells the story in exciting detail.  The author, a professor of English at SUNY Stonybrook, guides us through the labyrinthian detail of infighting, political machination, financial hanky-panky,  but eventual triumph.  His tone throughout is admirably objective.  He tells us about the arguments for and against the project.  He leaves it to the reader  to provide a final judgement, but there will be few who can withhold admiration for the achievements of those most closely associated with this airlift.    Among these latter, notably, is a group of American Jews who stood outside the Jewish establishment and, often acting fanatically, seem to have made all the difference.  One of these, Susan Pollack, deserves more than a footnote when the history of modern Judaism is written.    The author has interviewed hundreds, both in Israel and the United States, and he seems to have read everything that has any bearing on the subject.  One of the best features of the book is the exhaustive bibliography and suggestions for further reading, which are sprinkled throughout the book.    But since the author is not an expert on either Ethiopia or Ethiopian Jews, there are some notable weaknesses in the book.  To understand more about the whole project of Ethiopian immigration to Israel, we need to know more about the culture and religion of the Beta Israel, the Ethiopian Jews.  This author is not much help.  He does tell us, for example, that a religious leader among the Beta Israel is called a \\"ques,\\" a \\"Jewish priest.\\"  But how many are there of these ?  How does one become a ques ?  What education is involved ?  Are there any rivalries among the \\"quessotch\\" ?      The author also tells us that the language of the Beta Israel is Amharic.  But we know from other sources that this is true of only 80% of the Ethiopian Jews of Israel, the rest speaking Tigrinya, the official language of Eritrea. This fact is never mentioned in the book.    The author is also fairly innocent of knowledge about Ethiopian ethnic groups.  He tells us (p. 136), on the authority of gossip by an American embassy official, that \\"Oromo kids\\" created havoc on the streets of Addis Ababa at a certain point.  Anyone more sophisticated about inter-ethnic conflict in Ethiopia would be wary about making such a reckless, undocumented charge.    In the end, the book is what it is:  a remarkably detailed, documented account of one of the greatest events in Jewish history.  And it is also a  scholarly guide to some of the literature of the historic and ethnographic context.  It would be churlish to ask for more.	2005-09-28

But what is worse, people sometimes tell us things without caring whether they are true or false.  The result, the professor explains, is \\"b*******.\\"  B******* is worse than a lie because the liar cares about the difference between truth and falsity, while the \\"b******* artist\\" couldn't care less. Harry Frankfurt, the Princeton man in question, works this point on and on, in a slim book that is too long.  His eight thousand words could have been compressed into about forty, without loss of meaning but with with considerable gain in readability. <br /> <br />This little tract has attracted great attention and has, in fact, landed on the bestseller list.  It is an interesting idea but it is not worked out.  It is the sort of thing that might come up in the lounge of a faculty club, after too many martinis, and then seem absolutely brilliant. But it should be forgotten the next day, unless it gives rise to some serious thought and research, both of which would require time and effort.   <br /> <br />If Frankfurt or anyone else would care to work out his idea, here are just some of the problems that need to be addressed: <br /> <br />1) The term  \\"b*******\\" is more or less a taboo word, with its scatological connotations, which makes it less than suitable for a discussion of the issues at hand.  Perhaps \\"nonsense\\" would do better. <br /> <br />2)  Is there only a single phenomenon of \\"b*******,\\" as Frankfurt suggests, or are there any number of phenomena, perhaps related, all commonly called \\"b*******\\" ? <br /> <br />3)  Just were and how does \\"b*******\\" appear in our culture ?  Where is it employed in academia ?  Are there some disciplines, perhaps philosophy itself, more prone than others ? <br /> <br />Until such questions are worked out, the idea as it stands is itself a good example of the very phenomenon the author ostensibly criticizes.	2005-09-15

A great comic-book artist, Will Eisner, has given us this gift before his death in early 2005.  And what a pleasure it is to study these pictures, especially the faces.  Like all such great artists, he can give us an insight into the human experience. <br /> <br />That said, I find his contribution to the matter at hand -- the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" -- much more problematic.   <br /> <br />People who are possessed by a hatred of Jews -- from before Hitler, including Hitler, and including now all kinds of disreputable poison peddlers -- offer a ridiculous forgery (\\"Protocols...\\") as a warrant for the genocide of the Jewish people.  The great scholar Norman Cohn has told us all there is to be known about this anti-Semirtic screed (\\"Warrant for Genocide:  The Myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\\" first edition 1967).  There is little that Eisner can add, or subtract, from Cohn's work. <br /> <br />Of course more people may read Eisner than Cohn.  Eisner is more accessible, without a doubt.  But Eisner's work, essentially propaganda, cannot be taken as historically trustworthy.  People with a critical frame of mind will not be convinced by it.  And those without a critical frame of mind -- like those who believe the anti-Semitic peddlers of the \\"Protocols\\" -- can be persuaded one way or another and then back again;  they are hardly worth persuading. <br /> <br />Eisner's book can be a starting point for serious study, however.  That could be its greatest contribution.  From this point of view, though, the book is also less than perfect. First, there are a number of careless errors.  It is not true that the Nazis \\"plotted\\" the Reichtag fire of 1933 (p. 99).  The reference to a \\"neo-Fascist\\" group in the Italy of 1930 (p. 116) is nonsensical.  1930 was the period of Fascism, not \\"neo-Fascism.\\"  Moreover, the history of the \\"Protocols\\" in Italy is well described by Cohn (pp. 273, ff.), and isnot what Eisner thinks it is.  But while such errors are minor in themselves, they detract from the confidence we can have in this book.  What is much more serious is that the book fails to give much help to a reader who wishes to pursue the matter in depth.  True, there is a bibliography at the end, containing the Cohn book and other good sources, but there is no pointed help to the reader on where to begin, and what to expect from the various sources that are listed.  A bibliography needs to be annotated to be of much help. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend this book to someone who is new to the subject, but only with the proviso that it must be supplemented by more scholarly sources. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-07

Accordingly I read the two chapters devoted to these tests, skimming the others.<br /><br />I found the chapter dealing with Rorschach excellent.  It gives a history of the test, tells us what its proponents claim for it, and shows that there is no empirical basis for these claims.  The chapter is heavily based on the work of James Wood, et al. (\\"What's Wrong with the Rorschach\\"), which, in turn, gives more gory detail than most readers will need.  Annie Murphy Paul here performs a great service in making the facts accessible.<br /><br />The chapter on the MMPI is disappointing.  Again, there is a history of the test, with much biographical detail on its developers.  The chapter suggests, but does not spell out, that there is more validity and more reliability to this test than there is to the Rorschach.  The chapter also suggests that there is reason to take take the MMPI with a grain of salt, but it does not tell us very clearly just what the MMPI can or cannot do, if anything.<br /><br />I had great expectations for this book.  I have been disappointed by it.	2005-07-15

But it must also be said immediately that the ruminations of the hero are as often -- more often, in fact -- tedious and pretentious rather than engrossing. The hero and his virtues, as they are expounded by the author, are deeply conventional and tiresome in ways that the author could not have intended.  In the end, what we get is exactly the opposite of what is promised.  The author presents this man as interesting and challenging, but -- at least to this reader -- he comes through as depressingly conventional and very, very shallow. And shallow, I am afraid, is the word for the book too.	2005-06-27

Unlike their comrades elsewhere, they now have quite a respectable number of people voting for them.  Some ten percent of the French electorate, in fact, currently votes Trotskyist. <br /> <br />There may be dozens of Trotskyist groups in France, but only three sizable ones:  a) Ligue Communiste Rvolutionnaire, led by Krivine, et al.;  b) Lutte Ouvrire, nominally led by Arlette Laguiller but actually by a mysterious old man known as \\"Hardy,\\" and finally c) the Parti des Travailleurs, led by an octogenarian known as Pierre Lambert. <br /> <br />This last group, the \\"Lambertistes,\\" is the topic of this altogether extraordinary book. <br /> <br />I have more than a dozen books in my home that deal with the French Trotskyists.  Most of them (but not all !) have added to my knowledge to some extent.  But only this volume, by the ex-Lambertiste Phillippe Campinchi, is totally satisfactory.  He does tell us enough of the dreary version of Marxism espoused by Lambert, but that is not the main contribution of this book, nor is it an inherently interesting subject.  What is interesting, and what Campinchi tells in detail and with verve and wit, is how this Trotskyist cult operates from day to day:  the absolutism of its leadership cult, the group's obsession with secrecy, the intrigues that allow the group to manipulate trade unions and other organizations, and, not least, the goon squads of toughs that it employs and that compete with the goons of other groups. <br /> <br />This book tells about the Lambertistes, but, by implication, also about a great many other political extremists.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

I bought this book at the same time that I bought my iPod.  I was taken in by the \\"Missing Manual\\" part, hoping that the book would give some basic information on how to use the iPod and the related software.  It does no such thing. <br /> <br />To illustrate my frustration with this book, let me relate a couple of exeriences.   <br /> <br />The iPod idea is not really meant for classical music, since classical music pieces are not organized around \\"songs.\\"  I happen to be interested in classical music, and, with time, I have been able to work around the iPod's limitations and make it serviceable for Beethoven, Bach, and the rest.  But this book was of NO help in this. Instead, it tells the reader that if he is a classical music buff, he will just have to suffer for his art. <br /> <br />Keeping in mind my first lessons in computing, back in the 1980's, I know that the three basic laws of all computing are backup, backup, and backup.  When you work with an iPod, backup is even more important than for ordinary computing.  This book is of very little help with that.  Again, I had to learn by myself, without much help from this book. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are things in this book that are interesting.  The way to use this book is not as a source of answers to questions you have (that would really be a manual), but as a source of ideas and facts that you never knew were there. So I won't throw it out in disgust;  I'll read in it from time to time.  I have gained some insights from it and will no doubt do so in the future. <br /> <br />	2005-02-10

But don't count on this work to be of much help in the details of pursuing a case.  Dr. Rothstein is not a lawyer, and it shows.  He is also not a professional writer, and that shows too.  The index is frustrating.  Example:  I tried to find out about information subpoenas --  very useful tools if you're trying to collect on a judgement -- and indeed, there is some material on it.  The index for this subject will point you to pages 7, 39, and 43-44, but the most useful information is found on pages 78-79.  Moreover, Dr. Rothstein's information is nowhere near as accurate or complete as that found in a professional law book.  For that, I rely on \\"New York Practice,\\" by David D. Siegel.  No, you definitely don't have to be a lawyer to understand Siegel.  You just have to be someone who needs a legal explanation for what, after all, are legal procedures.  Now I found a funny thing about the way the author of the present book, Dr. Rothstein, has, or rather has not used the work by Siegel.  Dr. Rothstein lists the Siegel book as one of his references, and tells us to go to chapter 21 in Siegel, which, he says, is entitled \\"Small Claims.\\"  Well, there is no chapter 21 in the edition of Siegel that Rothstein cites.  Instead there is a Section 21 in which \\"Small Claims\\" is mentioned in passing.  The parts of Siegel that help in actual preparation of Small Claims cases are scattered throughout the book.  I cannot believe that Dr. Rothstein ever cracked the Siegel book. He should have ! Conclusion:  start with the Rothstein book -- it'll get you into the thing.  Then check the fine points in SIegel.	2005-01-28

There are easier programs that do such elementary chores.  To get involved with PSE you have to be more serious about your pictures than that.  But, now, let's say that you are serious, that you are willing to invest some hours to learn a little more about the possibilities of digital photography.  In that case, there really is nothing better than the combination of this excellent book and a sophisticated camera. (I use the Nikon D-70, which has provision for interchangeable lenses.  Canon makes something similar.)  This book, while written in simple language and not requiring any particular background to read, does require effort.  You need to spend quite a few hours to study this work.  But the rewards of this effort are great.  The book takes you through every nook and cranny of the PSE, and, believe me, there are quite a few such nooks and crannies.  Once you have studied this book, you will be a better person -- well, a better photographer anyway.  But if you are not serious about spending the time and effort, forget it;  just click with your  point-and-shoot and let it go at that.	2005-01-23

It seems that some six decades ago she had quite a few husbands and even more lovers, and that these men, in turn, were not shy about sex with still other partners.  The prose is plain.  There are no literary pretensions, and, it would seem, there is little that a reader of today can gain by way of insight into the human condition by reading this book.<br />But it so happens that Constance Webb is a one-time wife of the noted West Indian  political theorist C.L.R. James, and these reminiscences do add to our knowledge and understanding of this writer.  Webb recounts many other entanglements with men, but her relationship to James, in and out of marriage, was life-long.<br />So we learn a great deal about James and his curious band of \\"Johnsonites.\\"  James used \\"Johnson\\" as a pseudonym while he was a member of the American Trotskyist movement, and the \\"Johnsonites\\" were his cult-followers;  they were a cult within a sect.  <br />Webb gives details of the extraordinary nature of the cult. It was a group built around a worship-like adulation of the leader and the strict subordination of the followers. Webb did become disillusioned with the cult in time, but, to this day, she does not seem to realize just how ludicrous the cult's pretensions to wisdom and virtue must appear to outsiders.<br />Another former member of the same group, Grace Lee Boggs, has also written her memoirs (\\"Living for Change\\"), and the two books should perhaps be read together because they complement one another.  Both will be valuable to students of American Trotskyism, and, more generally, to students of small religious and political sects.	2004-05-24

When Alger Hiss was interviewed by the Washington Post in 1986, he answered in the affirmative when asked whether he admired Stalin. &quot;Oh yes.  In spite of knowing the extent of his crimes....&quot;  G. Edward White reports this incident without comment, as if it were of no import.  This light-headedness about Hiss's hard-core Communist commitment makes this important book less useful than it could have been.<br />The essential work about Alger Hiss, of course, is the book entitled &quot;Perjury&quot; by Allen Weinstein (second edition,  1997). The present volume adds additional details that buttress Weinstein's conclusions that Hiss was guilty of espionage for the Soviets.  But White is particularly strong in biographical and psychological details.  Hiss is shown to have been a particularly intelligent, well-spoken, urbane, educated, and kind-hearted person. The fact that this man was also  a traitor to his country and a persistent, life-long liar about his espionage is treated by White as  a psychological puzzle.  But White's psychological explanations are not convincing.  There are, after all, many well-educated, charming WASP Americans who never become traitors.  Why did Hiss ?<br />Hiss spent many decades of his life insisting that he was &quot;inncocent&quot; and wrongfully convicted.  In this campaign he was assisted by The Nation magazine and others with connection to the political Left.  For former and continuing Communists especially, it remains an absolute article of faith that both Hiss and the Rosenbergs were &quot;innocent,&quot; despite the completely air-tight proof that they were intelligence agents for Stalin.  What accounts for this discrepancy between the evidence on the one hand and these persistent, apparently sincere, self-righteous professions of &quot;innocence&quot; ?<br />In the case of the Rosenbergs, it has been suggested (and unfortunately I cannot remember by whom) that from the point of view of committed, devoted Communists, therewas nothing more heroic and moral, and therefore completely innocent, than service to international Communism (in the days when there still was such a thing).  So the self-righteousness of Hiss was perfectly sincere.  He was innocent in every possible way that makes sense to a Communist.  In fact, anyone who doubts this supreme innocence is himself a depraved red-baiter, anti-Communist hysteric, McCarthyite, and so forth.<br />To White, living in a mental word in which treason and perjury are crimes, Hiss's self-righteousness is a problem to be explained psychologically.  But once the nature of Communist devotion is understood, the mystery vanishes.	2004-03-23

Science Confronts the Controversial Inkblot Test	Books	5	24	43	N	Y	A rough diamond	Almost everyone has heard of the Rorschach test.  It consists of a series of ten ink blots that are presented to the patient with a request to tell what he sees in them.  The responses constitute,  or so it is claimed, something of an x-ray of the respondent's total personality and character.<br />Why should such perceptions of ink blots give a such a powerful picture of mental life ?  The reasons are said to lie in psychoanalytic theory, which hold that unconscious motivations, unique to an individual, govern our every perception.  Moreover, it has been said, the Rorschach test &quot;works,&quot; i.e. it can predict behavior, and it can tell the mentally sick from the healthy.<br />But, as these authors painstakingly demonstrate, there is amost no validity whatever in these claims.  It is true that gross mental illness can generally be detected by this test, as, for instance, when a patient claims that he can very clearly see God conversing with Elvis Presley in Card I of the test.  But then again, this kind of diagnosis surely needs no Rorschach.  Beyond that, the test has failed each and every reasonable attempt at validation.  Scientifically oriented psychologists have rejected the Rorschach a long time ago.  Some clinical psychologists hold on to it, for reasons that are not -- to put this politely -- edifying.<br />To someone like me who has been exposed to Rorschach instruction in graduate school many years ago, this book gives truly fascinating information.  The abysmal failure to validate the test, of course, is no news.  But the details about the internal battles within clinical psychology give a rare insight into the foibles of apparently educated men.  The authors are particularly good at analyzing why it is that for certain people the test, to this day, retains credibility.  The answer here turns out to be strikingly similar to the reasons why fortune tellers can thrive in a presumably science-dominated world.<br />When I was an undergraduate psychologystudent a truly long time ago, I had a great teacher, Gardner Murphy, whose memory I cherish to this day.  Upon reading this book, I took Gardner Murphy's old text from my shelf to see what he had to say about the Rorschach.  I was shocked to find that he accepted the unfounded claims of the Rorschachers of his day, citing studies that were never replicated by anyone else.  So it turns out that Murphy had feet of clay.<br />But Murphy wrote long before the devasting negative findings that Wood, et. al. cite in this book.  So he had something of an excuse for his gullibility.  No such excuse can be advanced for those who support the Rorschach today.<br />I think that this is an exceedingly important book, and I reward it five stars without qualm.  Nevertheless I must mention that it could have benefitted from more than a bit of editing.  It is inexcusably repetitious. Beyond that, the prose is needlessly rough.  But these are minor complaints.  The book is a jewel, a rough diamond to be sure, but a true jewel.	2004-01-18

Cannon vs. Max Shachtman in the Communist League of America, 1931-1933&quot; is quite a hoot.  Jim Robertson and some of his followers have spent long hours in various archives and have put together a 700-page volume of various letters and documents originating with the first generation of American Trotskyists in the Communist League of America. The book has a lot of careful detail, apparently scrupulous source references, and best of all pictures of youngsters  who thought they were playing a role in world history. The very low price (if bought through Amazon, as I did) makes it a bargain at about $14.<br />Robertson gives the story his own sectarian spin.  But that is hardly of interest.  There is stuff in this volume that will entertain and amuse anyone interested in religious and political sects:<br />a)  The extraordinary self-importance of these American Bolsheviks is illustrated in great detail.  <br />b)  The personal letters and &quot;internal documents,&quot; many published here for the first time, give a rare glimpse into what is probably the most important characteristic of these sectarians:  the compulsive back-biting and incessant personal attacks of one to another of these &quot;comrades.&quot;  To me it seems quite obvious that these movements attract mainly people whose days are filled with bitter inter-personal antagagonisms.  Their politics often seem no more than a chance at playing out this proclivity.	2003-12-20

Its overall story is valuable and persuasive.  The T-groups, the Encounter movement, EST, the Esalen crowd, they are all shown for what they are, and convincingly so.  The &quot;humanistic psychology&quot; movement was ( is ?) deplorable and a bit of a menace, and Joyce Milton, with all the faults of this book, has shown how and why this is so.	2003-11-22

Jensen	Books	4	47	53	N	Y	Jensen may not be the last word on human variation	One of the best documented facts of social science is the following:  it is possible to administer tests of intelligence that are remarkably (though not completely) reliable and consistent over time.  This tested intelligence correlates very highly with success in school.  It is also known that tested intelligence correlates with social-economic status, and, even when controlled for SES, within families.  So it has been generally accepted, for about a hundred years now, that intelligence has both genetic and environmental components.<br />But for almost as long, there has been a debate over the relative contributions of heredity and environment.  There are implications of this debate for social philosophy, for this reason:  liberal social philosophers stress the perfectibility of man, while conservatives have a gloomier, more pessimistic view.  Since it is easier to alter environmental than genetic factors, liberals hope that intelligence is more environmentally influenced. <br />Now enter Arthur R. Jensen, an enormously productive and talented researcher at the University of California.  Since the late 1960's, he has produced a barrage of totally persuasive research that shows, beyond much question, that intelligence has much more to do with heredity than with environment.  Any hope that all human beings can have an equal amount of ability is now shattered.  In retrospect, of course, such a hope was never reasonable.<br />This is bad news, and not only for the liberals.  Jensen's findings make us look at society with less optimism than we would like.  His findings do not mean that we must give up on more humane arrangements, nor on our ideals of equal opportunity.  But it warns us we must take into account the inequalities in ability that seem here to stay.<br />Miele's book, in the form of an extended interview with Jensen, tells the story of Jensen's research findings and also of the resistance to accepting these findings.  There have been political attacks on Jensen as a &quot;racist,&quot; and these attacks are duly rebutted in this book.  In fact, much of the book is taken up by such controversies, and this is perhaps as it should be.  But foolish attacks aside, there are deeper problems with Jensen's presentation of his work that this books barely touches.<br />1)  It needs to be said more clearly and more strongly that the group differences documented by Jensen -- differences of relative frequency -- are statistical in nature and have no application whatever for the assessment of a given individual. <br />2)  The &quot;mental abilities&quot; that are probed in I.Q. and similar tests represent but a small portion of those attributes on which humans differ.  We know from personal observation that some people are kinder than others, have more empathy than others, are less selfish than others.  Social science, so far, has had little to say about the distribution of such traits.  That is regrettable.<br />3)  Jensen is very much impressed by the &quot;abilities&quot; that determine worldly success.  He even uses the term &quot;meritocracy&quot; with some approval.  His mindset here is self-consciously tough.  He does not seem to have much use or interest in those qualities that we may call &quot;saintliness.&quot; If an attribute does not show up on a battery of IQ tests, Jensen is not interested. But some day, perhaps, there will be a science of human assessment with a wider focus.	2003-08-08

Lewy's work distinguishes itself from previous writings in at least two ways:  <br />First,  he  has a good command of the sources, which he uses conscientiously and authoritatively.  He is thus able to paint for us the murderous Nazi policies in regard to Gypsies, and the unspeakable suffering of the Gypsy people under Nazi rule.<br />Second, and again on the basis of these sources, Lewy can tell us what the Nazi's Gypsy persecution was and what is was not.  It was a crime of great magnitude, and probably amounted to the outright murder of more than half of all the Gypsies in Nazi-controlled areas.  It was not a \\"Holocaust\\" in the sense of the Nazi killings of the Jews.  The Holocaust sought to kill all Jews without distinction while the murder of Gypsies involved a Nazi policy of killing some and sparing others.<br />There were of course still others who suffered greatly under the Nazis.  There were Communists and Socialists, and Jehovah's Witnesses, among many other such groups.  Whole nations were targeted, for instance the Poles.  Lewy cannot deal with all such Nazi crimes, but he should have at least reminded us of them in order to provide perspective and comparison.  This is a fault of the book.<br />A second fault lies in Lewy's apparent ignorance of the ethnographic and linguistic literature concerning the Gypsy people.  Some such acquaintance would have prevented some rather naïve observations.  And it would also have made him more knowledgeable in his references to the many self-styled spokesmen for the Gypsies.<br />Such faults, however, are heavily outweighed by the very substantial virtues.  This book is an absolutely indispensable contribution to our knowledge of the Nazi dictatorship.	2002-12-28

Books	5	54	70	N	Y	The Truth is More Entertaining Than Fiction	The topic, at first glance, is very narrow. This is not a book about how to study the Middle East, nor about American academia, but about the intersection of these: how the Arab Middle East in fact is and has been studied in American universities.<br />Once this narrow focus is understood and accepted by the reader, there is a fascinating read here. Kramer is very knowledgeable about the inner workings of &quot;Middle Eastern Studies,&quot; and more particularly about the Middle East Studies Association (MESA). The story he has to tell is actually more entertaining than most of the novels with academic settings, and the humor more mordant, because it is all true, alas. The second chapter about Edward Said is worth the price of the book.<br />Of course the Marxists and other Israel-bashers won't like this book -- it tells us too much about them.<br />That said, there are regretful lacunae in Kramer's book. It would seem that &quot;area studies,&quot; of which the Middle Eastern is but one, can lend themselves to superficiality perhaps more than the traditional disciplines of history, language study, sociology, religious studies, etc. Kramer is a bit evasive on this. And Kramer is also a tad too fond of social science jargon. &quot;Paradigm,&quot; a word introduced with the present meaning by Thomas Kuhn back in 1962, appears on practically every page of Kramer's book. Kuhn himself, in the second edition of his book, in 1970, found himself obliged to clarify his meaning.<br />But these are minor quibbles. I learned a great deal from this book, especially about the pretensions of (some of) America's academics. Five stars here, well earned.	2002-12-18

Many of the things that we fear so much pose small risk when compared to other things that we fear less but pose greater risk. For example, in the recent sniper scare in the Washington area, people drove many miles outside the area to purchase gasoline.  They thus incurred a far greater risk on the roads than they would have from the sniper. <br />To explore this important topic in a scholarly manner we need, first of all, to come to terms with the existing data on risk, mainly data relating to crime, accident, illness, and mortality. Second, we need a social-psychological consideration of how people weigh relative risks -- why it is that spectacular and  rare occurrences seem more frightening than the familiar hazards of crime, accident, and sickness.<br />Unfortunately, the author of this book does not present such materials objectively.  Social statistics, when they are mentioned at all, are treated loosely and impressionistically. For example, the reader is not given the information that would enable him to check on the primary sources.  And when it comes to interpretation of data, the author generally substitutes his political and moral preferences for hard-nosed inquiry.<br />This book was written before 9/11 and also before the new revelations concerning the extent of Catholic priests' sexual misconduct.  While he could not have known about these developments, what he did say on related matters can now be very clearly seen as wrong-headed.   Referring to the Oklahoma bombings, he suggests that any fear of Middle Eastern terrorists is irrational.  Regarding the Catholic Church's problems that were already surfacing when he wrote, he takes the opportunity of bashing the respected Catholic scholar (and priest) Andrew Greeley, who had warned his church at a time when more could have been done by the hierarchy.<br />The book has some of the external appurtenances of scholarship, mainly footnotes, but these only hide the fact that it is a subjective, unscientific treatment of a subject that really deserves better.	2002-12-13

Even people who have belonged to synagogues for years will find much of interest and many insights.<br />But when the book purports to tell the story of rabbinical succession, it falls short. The author interviewed an admirable number of the players in this drama. But what he has learned does not add up to a coherent account.<br />The author focuses on the \\"search committee,\\" and, indeed, it would seem that this is where most of the decisions were made. But he fails to give us the context: 1) what are the rules for appointing such committees ?; 2) how in fact was the committee appointed ? 3) how were committee decisions ratified by the board and/or congregation ?<br />To answer 1), we need to know something about the bylaws of the congregation. Bylaws are never mentioned in this book. Nor is the Religious Corporation Law of the state, which generally sets a legal environment for the congregation.<br />To answer 2), we need to know something about the politics of the congregation, and its factions and cliques. The author suggests that at least one member of the congregation wanted to be on the search committee but was not appointed. But he doesn't follow up by asking who, why, and how one makes it to a committee of this sort.<br />To answer 3), we would again need to know about the bylaws. Do they require ratification by the congregation, by the board, by whom ? Beyond the bylaws which set the formal rules, again, we need to know how the procedure works in practice.<br />In short, the book does not tell us about the actual group dynamics, that is to say the politics of the congregation. Internal politics work by factions and cliques. To learn how these work, we need to know who talks to whom and how, inside and outside the formal meetings.<br />But despite these shortcomings, this is a book that anyone with an interest in thesociology of American religion will want to read.	2002-09-19

The British scholars Bernard Kettlewell and E.B. Ford, beginning in the early 1950's, conducted studies and experiments at Oxford University, on what they thought was natural selection among moths. These experiments were widely taken to offer experimental verification of Darwinism.  In recent years, however, younger scientists in Britain and the United States have called into question the methods and theories of these Oxford scholars.  Other scientists, however, disagree with the critics and continue to regard the Oxford work as fundamental.<br />The author of this book has previously written articles in the Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times Book Review, and is apparently a professional writer.  As she states herself, she is not a professional scientist.  Nevertheless, she pours scorn upon scorn on the Oxford scholars, sparing neither sarcasm, nor damaging anecdote, nor psychological explanations for their alleged shortcomings.<br />It is of course normal in science that today's truth is tomorrow's error.  The Oxford scientists who worked in the 1950's were less sophisticated in their methods than the specialists of today.  I do not doubt that the older work is in need of updating and criticism.  But it is not in need of this kind of put-down by a non-scientist, writing for a non-scientist audience.	2002-09-18

What we have here is a journalistic report of a man who led a group of right-wing \\"Patriots\\" in the State of Washington for a period of several years.  It was the self-styled Washington State Militia over which John Pitner presided in the early 1990's, and Jane Kramer gives us her impressions of his personality, his friends and family, and the larger circle of right-wing militants with which he was in touch.<br />It is an important subject, especially in this period of terrorism on the left and the right.  We know that there have been some home-grown right wingers who were involved in violence.  But whether John Pitner was so involved remains moot.  All we know is that he was convicted in a federal court of relatively minor weapons charges.  Most of all, we don't know whether John Pitner is in any way representative of the really bad guys who probably are out there somewhere.<br />Kramer does not claim that Pitner is representative, but if he is not, what exactly do we learn from this book ?  Only that there was this fairly pathetic, ineffective resident of Whatcom county who got caught, and whose friends and associates promtly abandoned him.  Do we learn anything at all about the movement of which he is said to be a part ?<br />Kramer's prose suggests an all-knowing observer.  But as she gives us the thoughts and something of an interior dialogue of her subject,  she does not tell us how she knows what she says she knows about his mental life.  And our confidence in her knowingness is not strengthened by her compulsive name-dropping.  She refers to Max Weber, to Coleridge, to Durkheim, to Rousseau, to Clausewitz.  Those of her readers who have also studied one or the other of these savants will not be impressed by these pretentious references.  And neither does it inspire confidence in Kramer's research to see her confuse, several times, a federal circuit court of appeals with a federal district trial court.	2002-08-09

The greatest of its many virtues is that it brings us up to date on the the most recent scholarship concerning the whole of the Nazi persecution of Jews, including the historical roots of the policy. But the devil, as always, is in the details.  Roseman gives them to us:  who did what and when and how.  It is the details that tell us how the previously unthinkable -- the cold-blooded murder of six million Jews -- was accomplished by the highly educated elite of the Nazi state.<br />In the past historians have argued about the precise personal responsibility of Hitler.  Some have insisted that this responsibility was overwhelming, others have held that  the main motive force came from the workings of the Nazi bureaucracy.  Roseman shows that the most recent findings give credence to both factors:  without Hitler's very personal involvement, there would have been no Holocaust;  nor could it have been carried out without the enthusiastic complicity of hundreds of major Nazi officials.  <br />It is in the nature of this kind of book that it will perhaps be of greatest interest to those who have already read other, more general works, for instance Wistrich's equally brilliant but more introductory \\"Hitler and the Holocaust.\\"  Nevertheless, Roseman's volume can be recommended even to beginners in this area.<br />Among the facts shown by Roseman that may be new to many readers are the the following:  the greatest responsibility for the mass murder, after Hitler, belongs to Heinrich Himmler;  the Nazis planned to kill eleven million European Jews, almost twice as many as they ultimatelymore than half of the Holocaust victims perished succeeded in reaching;  more than half of the Holocaust victims perished between March 1942 and February 1943;  and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the titular head of the Arab Palestinians at the time, visited Hitler in November of 1941 and was given assurance by Hitler that he would \\"solve\\" the problem of Jews.	2002-05-01

This book can confidently be given to a high school student, whose knowledge of modern history will, with this book alone, take a qualitative leap forward.  And it should be read by those who have already read everything else on the subject, whose knowledge will be brought up-to-date. As always, Professor Wistrich's style is fluent and engaging, and the Modern Library has done its part by producing a physically attractive object.<br />I do have just two little quibbles.  It would have been useful, particularly for the beginner,  to include suggestions for further readings in a special section. Professor Wistrich does make such suggestions, but they are somewhat buried in his Notes.

She elicited life histories from these women, which she relates rather briefly in this book, and then concludes with five \\"lessons\\" on how to deal with such deviant people and groups.<br />My first reaction to this book was one of gratefulness to the author for having done what was, she makes clear, a most disagreeable task;  these subjects weren't exactly fun to be with. The book is written with intelligence, diligence, and professionalism. The author shows a commendable familiarity with the relevant recent social science literature. Most of all, it is refreshing to see a scholarly contribution to a field that is too often left to sensationalist journalists.<br />But my second reaction developed as I read through these dreary reports about these dreary people. I became bored and more bored as the reading progressed.<br />I cannot believe that these people are as pathetically uninteresting as they appear in this book. That they are disagreeable and hateful is beyond doubt. But I think that anyone who has ever observed the participants in a fringe movement will testify that there almost invariably times of enthusiasm, of excitement, of peek experience, of lives lived with great intensity. Professor Blee captures little if any such spark.<br />I think I know what went wrong.<br />First, the author tells us about the women but not about the men in these racist organizations. That seems to me to be like writing a history of what happened on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, figuring that the Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays belong somehow to a different world. It is a feminism run amok, in my opinion, to deal with a social movement consisting of both men and women as if the story of each were essentially unrelated to the other. Much of the spark of fringe social movements comes exactly from male-female interaction, especially in the younger age groups. More than one former member of radical youth groups has told me that it was precisely the stimulation of male-female relationships that made membership so stimulating.<br />Second, her method of eliciting life histories puts the emphasis on individual members. Group dynamics -- the inevitable internal dissentions, the struggles for leadership and prestige -- none of that is captured in this book.<br />Finally, the author has the unfortunale habit of quoting unrelated writers, often of the politically correct persuation, as if they were somehow relevant to her topic. \\"As the literary theorist Henry Louis Gates Jr. observes....\\" (p. 79); \\"As the cultural theorist Edward W.

Son of a low-Church clergyman, educated in a British &quot;public&quot; (i.e. private) school, he rose to the very heights of British academia, as an art historian, apparently mainly by dint of high intelligence, talent, and hard work.  One of the Cambridge group of young Communists in the 1930's, he also became a spy for Soviet Russia, but was not exposed until many years later, during the Thatcher years.  He was also famously, promiscuously homosexual.  His story allows for a variety of treatments.  One would be low-brow, highlighting its inherent prurience.

I refer not only to its volume by Richard Pipes, &quot;Communism,&quot; but also to its altogether excellent &quot;Hitler and the Holocaust&quot; by Robert S. Wistrich. The Pipes volume, as is to be expected from Richard Pipes, is a tour de force of historical summary and interpretation. It is one of those books that can be given to a teenager for a quick introducction to an importatnt subject, and can also be read by knowledgeable adults for its often new and striking insights. But excellent as it is for its overview -- particularly in its introductory and concluding chapters -- this book also shows signs of haste in its composition. Its weaknesses, as I see them, are four: 1) The tone is often overbearing, opinionated, arrogant. Reasonable people can have different views on many of the issues that it discusses, but Professor Pipes shows little patience to entertain any such dissent. 2) In his apparent haste to do this overview, too many topics that should have been included are not. The important French, German, and American Communist leaders, for example, cannot be found in the index. 3) The Suggestions for Further Reading, which should be so important in a work of this kind, are inadequate.  4) There are more errors than can be justified. It is not true that Lenin's Council of People's Commissars consisted &quot;exclusively of Bolsheviks,&quot; as is claimed on page 40; on page 45, a non-Bolshevik on this Council is quoted and named. It is not true that Djilas was the first to speak of a new Soviet exploiting class (p. 167). This had been done many years earlier by Bruno Rizzi, James Burnham, Max Shachtman, and others. It is not true that Lenin was unaware of the negative aspects of Stalin (p. 57). In fact, Lenin had warned against Stalin in his famous &quot;Testament.&quot; A more leisurely writing and a more careful editing could have eliminated such howlers. Nevertheless, overall, this is a very valuable summary statement of what Communism was like.	2001-11-13

The author is right when he insists that this difference between Black and White America deserves examination.  He provides this, positing three tendencies among his fellow-Blacks:  a &quot;cult of victimology,&quot; a &quot;cult of separation,&quot; and a &quot;cult of anti-intellectualism.&quot;  Some of what he has to say, especially about Black academics, is insightful.  Some is much less than that, for instance his foolish recital of problems he has had with his Black students.  But foolish or insightful, he talks with the arrogance of a young know-all.  It does not seem to occur to him that other Black American academics, though they may have different perspectives on these matters, deserve the respect that he feels he himself has been too often denied.  These are matters of tone and style, and they are important.  But what is more important is the generally flimsy intellectual underpinning of his discussions.  He does not seem to be at all interested in African-American history, so Marcus Garvey, the most memorable of all Black nationalists, is barely mentioned.  McWhorter does speak interestingly about Black English, a matter on which he is an expert.  But he does not see fit to mention any of the great descriptive linguists who came before him, so that his discussion on this topic also, alas, remains superficial.	2001-08-22

CLR James, the Black literary, left-wing politician originally from Trinidad, the home of Naipaul.  In the story James is called &quot;Lebrun,&quot; and some of the unimportant details have been slightly altered.  James, who died in 1989 in his eighties, has recently enjoyed a bit of posthumous lionization at the hands of certain left-wing writers. While Naipaul deals with him with utmost gentleness, there is no exxcaping the fact that James was an inveterate sorehead, a notorious womanizer, an energetic blowhard, a careful organizer of his own coterie in several countries.  Naipaul suggests that there may also have been a sinister side to Lebrun/James.  He doesn't insist, but the suggestion is there.  Let the reader decide !	2001-08-12

I keep a Webster-Merriam Unabridged in my study, plus earlier editions of the American Heritage, and I also keep one-volume dictionaries in each room of my house.  But this present 4th edition American Heritage is very special;  it has quickly become my favorite of all the English-language dictionaries that I own.  First, there is the physical layout -- the beautiful pictures, the type face that makes for easy reading, the wonderful color.  But mainly it is a matter of sheer amount and quality of information.  Try, for instance, the &quot;f-word.&quot;  Of course we all know how to spell it and what it means when a teenager yells it.  But did you its history in the English language ?  The 4th edition tells it.  You may think that you don't want to know, but after you read this word history, and many others in this book, you know that you will not want to do without this dictionary ever again. Of course, this book is no substitute for an unabridged.  I tried it on the phrase &quot;term of art,&quot; something that comes up frequently in court opinions and other learned discussions.  This dictionary will not tell you what the phrase means, but my trusty Webster-Merriam Unabridged will.   So you see, you too need to be a person of many dictionaries, or at the very least of two.	2001-08-07

It is very sound social science as far as it goes;  the statistics are professionally presented and are often strikingly revealing, especially when they are counter-intuitive.  But there is a most serious flaw in this book:  the authors give no guidance whatever to further reading.  Say you are interested in crime (Chapter 12).  You will see a lot here that will surprise you.  But if your curiosity has been aroused by the chapter, you will need to read at least some of the the scholarly literature before you have understood what the data mean.  How would you locate this scholarly material ?  The authors of this book give you no help.  Shame on them !	2001-07-09

It is breathtaking in its thoroughness.  It is a very detailed, masterful description of Bellow's life and work, though perhaps a bit more &quot;life&quot; than &quot;work&quot;. There is a question of whether quite as much life, especially love life, is really needed, but then the reader of this biography will get insights not only into Bellow's life but also into the life of our time.  Atlas obviously has tremedous admiration for Bellow, and the reader of  this biography -- THIS reader did-- will go away with a far greater appreciation of Bellow than he had before.  And yet there is a problem in Atlkas's disapproval of aspects of Bellow's life.  There are no doubt moments in Bellow's exhuberant public pronouncements where prudence would have required more tact and more taste, but Atlas surely goes too far when he accuses Bellow -- repeatedly ! -- of such  non-PC lapses as &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;misogyny&quot;.  On the evidence, these accusations are unwarranted, in my opinion.	2001-06-14
US	53078052	R2GPN5O4A6MPL	158567107X	857156330	The Voice of Modern Hatred: Tracing the Rise of Neo-Fascism in Europe	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	Well Intentioned but ill informed	It intends to be the kind of book that is very much needed:  a guide to and intelligent interpretation of the current extreme-Right movements in Europe.  The Front National in France, the neo-Nazis in Germany, the National Front in England -- we need to know more about these.  But this book is woefully superficial.  My disappointment began when I saw that there is no index.  Can you imagine, a book that purports to give information on all these phenomena without an index ?  After that, beginning my reading of the text, I soon learned that the author's information is shallow at best.  I have read a few other books on the subject and I found really nothing that I did not already know from these other works.  On many  details this author is quite wrong.  On important matters, for instance the really significant split in the Front National of France, he says so little that he might as well have said nothing.  His asides and psychological observations, now and then, rarely, give a little something.  But then this author is so annoyingly pretentious that even the occasional apercu must be taken with a pound of salt.  His disquisition on French grammar, error-ridden, will earn him a well-deserved F in that department.	2001-06-03

(One of Newman's followers, Lenora Fulani, is actually a bit of a menace because of her promotion of fringe candidates like Buchanan and Ross Perot).  The book also gives juicy details about some of the Trotskyist groups, mainly in England.  But when it comes to right-wing extremists, the book is less authoritative.  And the theoretical discussions, borrowing from social science speculations, are fairly weak.	2001-01-05

Just a little complaint, however:  the index of cases, said to be complete, is  not.  Loewe v. Lawlor, described on p. 163, for instance, is not listed in  the index of cases.  Unfortunately, I also found a few other cases which,  though treated in the book, are inexplicably missing from this index.	2000-02-28

Unfortunately their scholarship is often spotty.  One example of many:  they base their discussion of Jehovah's Witnesses on superficial,  secondary, non-scholarly sources.  They state that Jehovah's Witnesses  &quot;reject the use of tobacco and alcohol, and will not accept blood  transfusions.&quot; (P. 158) This is more-or-less correct regarding blood  transfusions, but the authors of this book are obviously not aware of the  fact that the scholarly literature concerning Jehovah's Witnesses documents  widespread alcoholism among the Witness leadership.  Similarly, on page 456  and elsewhere, the authors make sweeping statements concerning John Calvin,  statements that they fail to document, and which, in fact, constitute gross  oversimplifications.  On the other hand, the authors, with more attention  to research and more mature reflection, are no doubt capable of writing a  much better book some time in the future. They need to go back to the  library !	2000-02-28
