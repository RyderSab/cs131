US	52456406	R18BXCBZFVUUMY	0226067459	789460829	The Myth of Pope Joan	Books	5	34	35	N	Y	Reasoned and well researched	It is a joy to see this finely researched volume on a topic of such mythic proportions.  I have read several other books on the topic, but it is difficult to find writers who are interested in historical reality when it comes to Pope Joan.  As a Roman Catholic theologian concerned with the all-male prerogative regarding clerical service and power, I would be thrilled if there were some credible evidence for this event.  Alas, none can be found. <br /> <br />Still, many (Romans and reformers alike) believed it factual.  For them it gained credence from ritual and iconic evidence such as the birthing chairs used in pontifical ceremony that were supposedly necessary because a testicular examination had to be made of newly-elected popes after the fraud perpetrated by \\"la popessa.\\"   <br /> <br />Yet, Boureau doesn't seem interested only in writing an authentic history of the legend.  He seeks to get behind that legend.  So he looks closely at the relationship between the increasingly imperial-minded papacy of the Middle Ages and the psychological and personal rift that developed between the Bishop of Rome and his flock. <br /> <br />Detailed and exact, this fascinating book will assist its readers in understanding the possible source for this persistent myth.  Like all myths, it lacks historical accuracy but it is full of truthful insights about sacramental power, the nature of Christian service,  ecclesiastical authority and the persistent prevalence of patriarchalism.  Because of its beautiful attention to detail, it is a weighty volume and may be difficult for those who are just delving into ecclesiastical history.  But for those who enjoy swimming in this particular Tiber, it will be rewarding and enjoyable.	2005-10-07

Professor Norton has done us a great service by refusing the prevailing myopia with which most of us analyze the witchcraft accusations of Essex County, Massachusetts in 1692.  One cannot simply look at the events themselves, but must allow the gaze to expand to the social, historical, religious and military realities around those events.  In the case of Essex County, they combined in a way that could be considered a ticking bomb of sorts. <br /> <br />If you are like me, then the French and Indian Wars exist only on the periphery of your social memory.  We all heard about these wars in our school history classes as a prelude to the American Revolution.  Militarily, they were a bloody mess and even George Washington is said to have performed in a way that is less than satisfactory.  That's about all I remembered. <br /> <br />In the hands of Professor Norton, however, those wars became real to me because they became the context for the suffering of many who were intricately involved in the Essex County witch hysteria.  As I read IN THE DEVIL'S SNARE, I heard of settlers on the \\"Maine frontier\\" who lost loved ones to savage brutality of the First French and Indian War and who fled from it in the hope of preserving their lives.  As soon as hostilities ended these survivors returned.  When war broke out for the second time they either fled again or were killed in a brutal manner. <br /> <br />As the author demonstrates, these pious souls believed themselves a shining example of true Christian living.  Yet they came to understand themselves to be under siege by the devil.  The language they used to describe him and to explain their own terror is starkly synonymous with their descriptions of the enraged native warriors who attacked their settlements, often in retaliation for being cheated and mistreated. <br /> <br />This is not a beginner's book.  It is full of exact details, including legal, historical and social analysis.  One would do well to begin elsewhere to understand the witch hysteria of 1692.  But once you have the general story, turn to Norton's terrific volume for the details.  It is insightful and engrossing.	2005-10-07

This is especially so if you believe, as I do, that many lessons for our contemporary time can be gleaned from the experience of those who came before us.  Benjamin F. Martin has done a great service in helping us to feel the pulse of the French nation just prior to the outbreak of World War II.  He traces its inner conflicts and political maneuvers and gives us a look inside the French psyche in the two years running up to the start of war. <br /> <br />Desperate to avoid war, the French made the mistake of bargaining with the devil.  Kneeling before Hitler, they vainly and dangerously believed that the pacts he brokered had meaning for a world desiring peace.  But those pacts--and the time spent preparing them--were nothing more than opportunities for Hitler to strengthen his own hand.  Martin quotes Winston Churchill's evaluation of the Munich Pact, and it is appropriately directed not only to the British Prime Minister of the time (Neville Chamberlain), but to the French:  \\"You were given the choice between war and dishonor.  You chose dishonor and you will have war.\\" <br /> <br />Beyond my fascination with history, I am grateful for this book for another reason.  I wonder if it is not an important reminder that we need again today.  Are there parallels to be made between Europe in the late 1930s and the world as we know it now, faced with the unending violence perpetrated by terrorist extremists?  Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  Read this book and draw your own conclusions.  Are we who forget history not doomed to repeat it?	2005-09-23

Only nine years old at the time, I stood in the driveway of my family's home in Ocean Springs, Mississippi as the rain began that evening.  As people like to describe it, we \\"hunkered down\\" to ride it out:  my brother, dad, my maternal grandmother, and me.  Oh, and the cats, too.  Just a few hours later we were fleeing for our lives.  The cats were let out to locate higher ground.  They would surely die if locked in the house behind us.    Our story is featured in this book, drawn from the interview that my father (John A. Switzer) did with the Oral History Project of the University of Southern Mississippi.  Reading the book gave me chills and I realized that childhood trauma really never leaves a person.    Hearn's book is far from perfect.  Some might argue that it's not really \\"well\\" written.  But I recommend it nonetheless, because it does a great service in recounting and preserving in an easily-accessible way, the stories of average people who almost didn't live through the night and early morning of August 17-18, 1969.    There are some unfortunate inaccuracies that I hope will be corrected if this is reprinted.  And the style seems rushed.  Perhaps Mr. Hearn was in a hurry to get to press.  But, overall, it's a chance for the reader to be inserted into the life-and-death struggle of several people and families.  For that, Mr. Hearn has my great appreciation.  This book is available in softcover, as was the copy I purchased at a local bookstore.	2005-08-28

My colleague Tim Carmody has done a great service to everyone who has struggled to read the Bible!  The original title he proposed for this volume better illustrated his approach:  \\"The Art of Reading the Bible.\\"  That is exactly what Tim shows us--there truly is an art to reading and understanding the deep truths that are found cloaked in the Bible's many forms of literature.  He begins with a good chapter on basics, geared to creating readers who are comfortable with the Bible.  Here he addresses vital questions such as inspiration, inerrancy, context and human involvement in production of the scriptures.  As he demonstrates beautifully, the Bible as we have it today is the product of a process that is both ancient and new.  It represents the faith of those who have gone before, but finds new life and new breath in the believing communities of today.  Far from being a dusty set of documents, it is a \\"living Bible\\" with much to say to us today.   <br /> <br />One especially helpful tool is the manner in which Carmody identifies the world BEHIND the biblical text (the culture that produced it), the world OF the biblical text (the text itself) and the world IN FRONT OF the biblical text (the context of the reader).  These distinctions are absolutely vital to avoiding misinterpretation and as Carmody moves through the various forms of biblical literature, he returns again and again to these important distinctions.  He not only proposes an excellent methodology, he demonstrates his own faithfulness to that methodology. <br /> <br />The text is easily read, but offers profound insight.  It is well suited for introductory courses in theology or Bible.  To the believer who needs some help getting comfortable with the Bible, this work will be a great comfort.  But Carmody is also helpful to those who seriously wonder if the Bible remains relevant in the contemporary world.  This is the \\"thinking-person's\\" study guide!	2004-10-25

He has a firm grasp on church history and on topics like art and culture and he does a good job explaining many of the Roman Catholic customs and practices that often confuse those who aren't Catholic (not to mention many Catholics themselves!). He does use a rather uncritical approach, however, so his book will be especially beneficial to those who prefer a more conservative view of the issues he covers (such as sacraments, funerals, popes, ordained ministry, monasticism, vestments, holy objects, etc.). For those who lean toward a more progressive stance on many of these issues, this book will probably not be suitable. For them, I recommend an approach such as that of Greg Dues in CATHOLIC CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS: A POPULAR GUIDE (also available on Amazon). Catholicism is a religion that is much more pluriform and rich than many are willing to admit. Indeed, the various approaches of different authors are probably a sign of the church's continuing relevance today.  This review may not be received positively by some persons, but as a professional religious educator and a life-long Roman Catholic, I think we honor Christ and the church when we admit our differences without marginalizing or excluding one another.  On that score, I welcome emails and discussion!	2001-09-09

As a professional religious educator, I had a copy in my high school classroom. It is very helpful, not only because of the information it contains, but also because it goes into enough detail to avoid &quot;easy answers&quot; that don't always get the whole story across! It begins with a general discussion of what religious traditions are and how they must be based on real life to be most meaningful. Then it ventures into timely and eternal topics like the church's calendar, different types of feasts, sacraments and sacramentals. It has a healthy, updated and valuable methodology for dealing with issues like purgatory and prayers for the deceased (both of which are difficult issues for some of our Protestant brothers and sisters who reject these beliefs). The book is published by Twenty-Third Publications, which was recently purchased by the Augustinians of the Assumption. This religious order also publishes the only remaining Catholic daily newspaper, LA CROIX, in Paris. If you find this volume as helpful as I do, you may wish to look into their other publications as well.	2001-09-02

This five-volume work is the classic Dominican translation of his SUMMA THEOLOGIAE and is probably the most widely used English translation of the work. (As an aside, you may enjoy the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII that sought to rebuild Roman Catholic philosophy and theology on the work of Aquinas; it is included in this edition.) If your love is classic catholic theology, you need a copy of this work in your library. All of Roman Catholic theology was firmly based upon it for centuries and it remains an important foundation for modern catholic theology. Whether you buy it new or get yourself a used copy, you will enjoy the clear thinking process that Aquinas used as he explored the issues and questions of faith. Laid out question by question as Aquinas originally intended, this classic version of his work will endure for as long as the church endures. Though Aquinas seems to have suffered a breakdown at the end of his life and though he pronounced all of his work &quot;but straw,&quot; I doubt that you'll agree with that assessment when you venture into this masterpiece.	2001-09-02

We work with people of every religious persuasion and even those who profess no religious beliefs.  We pass them every day on the street and we live next door to them.  In the coffee shop we meet Jews, Muslims, Christians and Hindus.  We must begin to incorporate this reality into our approach to religious education.  This volume, edited by Norma Thompson, goes a long way to do just that and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a catechist or religious educator.  Chapters are written by Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant and Roman Catholic religious educators.  Similarities and differences are explained in approaches.

It is amazing how this book has generated such discussion and even condemnation!  Perhaps that's a good thing since the field of christology is like any other area of study: it needs to be refreshed and new ideas need to be generated to light the fire of new insight.  When it was first published, I posted one of the first reviews of this item on Amazon.  But that was by no means the last word because the book has continued to be a source of inspiration and learning for me.  It is very challenging reading, but it contains untold riches to be dug out like gold in a mine.  As I read the negative reviews the book has received, I find myself thinking that the reviewers simply don't understand what Haight is attempting to do.  His mind runs deep and has a very sharp edge to it.  Few are able to keep up, but I encourage anyone interested in the cutting edge of christology to buy this book and to study it.  Don't be in a hurry, but taste every sentence and every word.  And don't believe the charges against Haight that suggest that he's not faithful to the catholic tradition.  He is very faithful and very orthodox.  His criteria for authentic christology make that clear.  But he's not afraid to ask difficult questions to bring christology to a meaningful place in the contemporary theological scene.	2001-08-07

Though I do not recommend it for beginners who are just  initiating their study of the Pentateuch, it will prove of great value for  those who may be in the intermediate stage of study (and beyond) who wish  to explore a healthy critique of the four-source hypothesis which has come  to dominate this field of study.<br />Chapter One is especially valuable as  Blenkinsopp provides an historical overview of Pentateuchal scholarship to  date.  This chapter brings the reader up to par and offers the author a  starting point for his readable critique.  In short, Blenkinsopp suggests  that the hard lines of Pentateuchal source theory should be softened so  that a multitude of influences can be discovered and appreciated.  Perhaps  the greatest insight of this author is the realization that no critical  theory is perfect and that the insights of numerous theories can often  prove useful.	2000-08-25

Prior to the detailed commentary, a helpful historical sketch is given to assist the reader in situating the particular biblical book in its context. It includes maps and charts.<br />Though this volume comes highly recommended, it is not always on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of biblical scholarship.  If you choose to utilize this volume, you have made a wise choice, but you should not limit your library to this commentary alone.	2000-08-14

As with *The Community of the Beloved Disciple,* this volume avoids the  pitfalls of being either too simplistic or just over one's head.  In it,  Brown offers an ingenious look at the various communities of the Christian  Testament and describes their differences.<br />For my particular tastes,  Brown is sometimes too quick to accept the face value of some early  traditions concerning the Apostles.  But this slight weakness is easily  overcome by his scholarship, his open attitude and his readability.  This  volume is very helpful and will open the eyes of its readers to the fact  that there has not been only one ecclesiology is Christianity, but many.	2000-08-05

Have you ever purchased a book that seemed promising in regard to helping  you understand the Bible, but when it came it was either far too simplistic  or just over your head?  For most readers, this book provides insight and  commentary that will avoid both pitfalls.<br />Using the uncommon  characteristics of the Fourth Gospel, Raymond Brown laid out in this  readable volume his theories of why this account of the gospel is so  unique.  With accompanying charts that lay out the various groups which may  have composed the &quot;Community of the Beloved Disciple,&quot; Brown  makes his theory especially easy to grasp.<br />Losing Raymond Brown was a  great loss for the entire Christian Church.  Having heard him speak in  person and having read many of his works, I strongly urge this particular  volume upon you if you have an interest in the Fourth Gospel.	2000-08-05

To attempt to understand Jesus is to interpret Jesus, and through  the eyes of Theissen's characters we see a theoretical construct at work  which is not only insightful, but also faithful to the methods of modern  biblical criticism and Christian theology as a whole.  I highly recommend  this book for those who would like insights into the development of the  Christian canon of scripture and for those who wish to better understand  the Jewishness of Jesus.<br />Pastors, lay leaders and religious educators of  all types will gain invaluable information from this work.  It is both  scholarly and easy-to-read and it has been enjoyed and cited by educators  and theologians alike.	2000-08-02

Yet, as Christians we often do it in implicit ways which have shaped us since childhood.  In  this powerful book, Mary Boys offers a review of the history whereby Jews  and Christians moved from being siblings, to being rivals and finally,  enemies.  This is a situation that can be reversed as Christians learn more  about Judaism and, in turn, understand their own religion with more  depth.<br />Mary does not profess to be an expert of Judaica.  But here grasp  of catholic theology and history is superb.  Carefully and objectively she  lays out her case for why Christians should refuse the supersessionism  which infects our tradition.  As she explains, Christianity should be able  to express the power which is inherent in its tradition without denegrating  the faith of the Jewish people.  It is not necessary to insist that  Christians are the new People of God in a way which proposes that the Jews  are no longer God's people.  As the title suggests, Mary demonstrates that  God has blessings enough for both.<br />As a doctoral student in a summer  session at Boston College, I have had the privilege of studying with Mary  Boys.  Hers is a powerful and persuasive argument that seeks to recapture  something authentic and true about the foundations of Christianity.  It is  too easy to misread the gospel accounts as if Jesus and the Jews were  arrayed against one another.  In reality, Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew  himself and this fact is far too often forgotten by Christians.  <br />Typical  of other Pharisaic rabbis of his day, Jesus had a particular approach to  Jewish Law and customs and he had his own group of disciples who referred  to themselves as &quot;followers of the Way.&quot;  In this simple rabbi  these disciples encountered the power of God, placing Christians in a  position which should be one of gratitude toward the Jews, not  condescension and condemnation.<br />As Christians, are we able to develop a  new paradigm which is faithful to our tradition without demonization of the  Jews?  I believe we can.  I believe we must, and Mary Boys points a way in  which we can better understand ourselves in the process.	2000-07-31

If you are new to the topic of Jewish-Christian dialogue, this is a great place to start!   Even if your interest is in dialogue between religions other than Jewish  and Christian, the rationale and practical examples Mary gives are of  inestimable value.<br />The reality of our postmodern situation is that we  live in a world which has been made &quot;smaller&quot; by technology.  We  can talk to people of other nations and cultures with only a moment's  notice.  We can travel anywhere on the globe in only a few hours.  And  borders between nations are more and more fluid.  People of other religious  traditions are no longer &quot;out there.&quot;  They have become our  neighbors and coworkers.  How are we to relate to them?  Will we maintain a  attitude of superiority and triumphalism?  Will there be conversation and  dialogue, or only apologetics and attempts to convert those who are  different in their beliefs?<br />Mary Boys opts for authentic dialogue.  She  gives several examples that have radically changed the lives of their  participants:  Muslims, Christians, Jews and Buddhists.  Getting to know  the other as a person, building a &quot;hermeneutic of affection,&quot;  putting aside mistrust and false claims about the other--all of these have  a place in her methodology for mutual understanding.<br />Mary is a Roman  Catholic, as I am.  But her book has exciting ramifications for persons of  all religious traditions.  She does not call for a watering down of one's  own tradition, but for an appreciation of the tradition of another in a way  which enlivens one's own faith.  For in learning the traditions of another,  we discover the possibility of a renewed appreciation of our own.	2000-07-23

For twenty years, this book has been a constant source of information for me.  I first purchased my original copy while studying for the priesthood in the early 1980s.  It has since received a new cover and its pages are  enscribed with notes and highlights, but seldom do I write anything on  scripture without referring to one or more of its entries.<br />Whether you  are a lay person in the pews who wishes to know more or an academic who  sometimes forgot just where you read that interesting biblical insight,  McKenzie's work is for you.  The topics are myriad and in-depth, but are  also very readable.  They cover every possible angle of biblical interest,  including history, ritual, individual persons, and even biblical criticism.   Once you have familiarized yourself with this dictionary, it will become a  constant and invaluable companion.	2000-05-23

Once in a while a masterful book comes along in the field of Christology ... this is one of those books!  In Jesus Symbol of God, Roger Haight offers his written insights in the same manner he uses in the classroom:   with clarity, precision and a grasp of catholic tradition which is  mind-blowing in its universality.  This book is so well-informed as to be a  struggle at times, but it is worth the intellectual investment for anyone  who wants to know the state of Christology for today or its implications  and possibilities for tomorrow.<br />Haight's grasp of the field is  incomparable.  This work is truly on the cutting edge as it brings catholic  tradition into dialogue with postmodern realities.  Haight seems destined  to ask the difficult questions and one worries that this penchant may well  find him in &quot;hot water&quot; with those short-sighted minds who claim  the prerogative of preserving Roman Catholic doctrine in the curial halls  of Vatican City.<br />The theological world is indebted to Roger Haight and I  am proud to have learned from him personally.	2000-05-17

This is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in Palestine as it was during the intertestimental period.  Himself a Jew who was taken captive by his Roman conquerors, Flavius Josephus became an accomplished  historian of his day and his writings demonstrate an intimate knowledge of  the Romans and Jews of his time.  His writings offer insights into Jewish  history, religion and customs as well as the war which ended Jewish  independence for nearly two thousand years.<br />As with any account of  history, this one bears its own biases and preferences.  Begin with a  personal study of Josephus and his background and what we know of the  production of his historical accounts.  From this starting point, however,  nothing will prove more satisfying than reading the words of Josephus (in  translation) for yourself! This volume begins with the historian's own  autobiography and it only gets better as one continues to read.	2000-05-16

I have a great  appreciation for his approach and read the book while taking a course under  his tutelage at Boston College.<br />For me, the most powerful insight of  the Hispanic approach is its emphasis on community--a reality which our  postmodern culture would do well to rediscover!  As much as we prefer to  think of ourselves as self-determined individualists, the reality is that  much of who were are is given at birth.  We come from a particular culture  and ethnic group and we are products of the communities in which we are  raised.  Given this viewpoint, Hispanic theology argues for &quot;the  intrinsically relational character of the person&quot; and this insight  offers profound repercussions for how we must relate to the poor and the  marginalized (page 182).<br />Goizueta does not argue for determinism, but for  appreciation of the role which our communities play in offering meaning and  shape to our lives.  In giving us this insight, he crafts a theology which  is imminently pastoral in its approach and which allows us to accompany the  Hispanic community as it understands itself to be &quot;walking with  Jesus.&quot;	2000-04-25

Francoise Darcy-Berube has done catechists and religious educators a great favor by writing this book!  As she explains, getting people to go to church is not the main objective of religious education.  A deep and  holistic approach is necessary which develops an authentic religious and  theological literacy on which to build a mature faith.<br />Berube begins her  book by sharing a concern that was also a major problem for me.  When the  Catechism of the Catholic Church was published, I refused to have a copy in  my religious education classroom for two years because of my own fear of  how people would misuse the document.  Berube felt likewise!  <br />Faith is  not primarily a cognitive exercise where the adherent memorizes the right  answers.  Yet, there are those who desire that religious education return  to that &quot;catechism&quot; model with its exact question-and-answer  pattern.  As Berube says, religious education truly IS at a crossroads.   Will we continue to better our approaches as we stay on the holistic path  we have chosen since Vatican II, or will we turn back in fear and return to  the &quot;good old days&quot; which may have been adequate for a time?   Read the book and make your own choice.  I suspect you'll find Berube's  argument quite convincing.  In short, we cannot turn back and lose what we  have gained.  And if you are one of those in religious education who are  fighting &quot;the good fight&quot; to remain on this progressive path, you  need this insightful little book in your arsenal.	2000-04-25

Did you ever think that there was more to the story than was  being revealed?  If so, then this book is an excellent resource for you for  topics such as misogyny, celibacy, sexuality, family planning and  morality.<br />I am a Roman Catholic and a religious educator, but far from  finding the book to be shocking or full of &quot;dirty words,&quot; I found  it to be an insightful challenge to the church to return again to the  central teaching of Jesus and to turn away from its obsession with  genitalia and what people do with them.  There is more to faith than that.  And only by embracing the truth of our past can we grow beyond it.	2000-03-18

Weaving historical facts with conjecture and intrigue, they argue a theory which suggests that the shadowy Knights Templar discovered the body of Jesus under the ruins of the Herodian temple in Jerusalem.  They then spirited it away to a mountain in France where it is now buried.  How convenient that the authors were unable to dig on the conjectured site!  I am very sorry to see books like this because they blur the line between history and fantasy so powerfully as to confuse and deaden the mind.  I am all for enlightenment and the liberation of knowledge from those academics who feel that intellectual prowess is their private kingdom.  But silliness like this is not the answer.	2000-03-10
