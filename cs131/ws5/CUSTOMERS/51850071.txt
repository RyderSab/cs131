Everest Disaster	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A fascinating story of the human spirit	This book is Jon Krakauer's first hand account of his 1996 climb up Mt. Everest with a climbing group led by the renowned Rob Hall.  This season is known as the deadliest season in the history of Everest.<br />I like how this book is written because Krakauer doesn't set out to make anyone, not even himself, look like some sort of hero in this incident.  It seems as if he tells the story as it was according to his memory, and the heroes just naturally shine through.<br />As I read this book, I encountered many emotions.  There were points where I felt joy for great accomplishments and sadness for losses.  There were people who I just looked upon with great disdain.  I also feel for Jon Krakauer who seems to spend his life with many regrets over that tremendous night of loss.  <br />Overall, I found this book to be a very good read.	2002-03-19

It's told in the form of letters, memos, newspaper clippings, and other sorts of written correspondence.<br />The story revolves around Dry Creek Middle School.  Dry Creek is a very boring, small town.  One day, there is a problem with the school fountain, and the principal writes to a Miss Florence Waters to get an estimate for a new drinking fountain.<br />Miss Waters is a highly eccentric character, and she and the principal are constantly in miscommunication regarding this fountain. He wants a simple drinking fountain, and she is designing a grand artistic fountain.  Miss Waters then decides to correspond with the fifth grade class in the Middle School.  The kids fall in love with her letters and gifts.  She brings new life the boring, arid town of Dry Creek.<br />The girls loved this book.  They loved the unique writing style, as well as the over the top character of Miss Waters.  The mothers loved the book as well.  We all particularly enjoyed the romantic innuendo between Miss Waters and the fifth grade teacher.  This would be a great choice for anyone particularly a mother-daughter book club.	2002-03-10

I have a problem when novels don't give me a truly in-depth look at the characters.  Because this book pretty much consisted of several short stories based around the theme of a painting, it was a hard for me to become emotionally attached to many of the characters.  While I appreciate art, I wouldn't consider myself an art lover.  Maybe that's why  I had a hard time being attached to an inanimate object as the main character of this novel.  I did like a few of the stories.  The last story which focused on the creation of the painting was my favorite.	2002-02-18

While many of the kids at school never learn that Sherlock can speak, they all see that he is a special dog, and that makes Amy more popular.

This book is an interesting guide on how a child would go about digging a hole to the other side of the world.  <br />I remember as a child tryng to dig a hole to the other side of the world.  It made me wish that I had read this book as a child.  It would have sent my imagination reeling.<br />This book is highly educational, as well.  The child learns about geysers and other things she would encounter while taking on such an endeavor. I was worried that the girl who read this would have a difficult time remembering the elements of the story because it had so many scientific facts in it, but she didn't have a problem at all.<br />It's a very good book indeed.	2002-02-11

He has been in and out of hospitals since he was seven. No one was ever able to give me a clear understanding of what was going on with my son or how to deal with him.  We pretty much lived our lives waiting for the inevitable blow-ups and cleaning up the messes afterward.<br />Dr. Ross in this book explains how an explosive child isn't being manipulative or malicious when he explodes.  He explains how this sort of child just has difficulty in dealing with frustration, and we need to adjust our attitudes to his needs accordingly, just as you would with a child who has a physical difficulty.<br />This view has changed the way I look at my son, and it gives me some hope that if I implement these procedures in dealing with him that with time and work, we'll have a son who handles frustration a great deal better than he does now.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an easily frustrated child.	2002-02-11

I worried because I thought that I might talk over the children's heads, so I researched several books on how to teach children poetry.  Out of the dozens of books that I looked through, I found this one to be the most useful.<br />This book is divided into five sections.  The first section deals with ideas to help give children inspiration to write poetry.  Also, it provides helpful points to promote good writing habits.  The second section contains several mini lessons which teach different poetic techniques. Section three contains fun long term poetry projects.  Section four has independent study activities, and section five contains teacher reference information.<br />All in all, this was a terrific book.  I didn't use every lesson provided, but it did provide me with a decent outline.  Also, I appreciated that this book contained several classic poems that were easy for the kids to understand.	2002-01-25

Have you ever looked at a painting or a picture and imagined a whole life for the person or people in the scene?  That's pretty much what Tracy Chavalier does with this novel.  She brings to life the the girl in one Vermeer's paintings.<br />The character she creates is a beautiful wide-eyed innocent girl who matures into womanhood under the roof of Johannes Vermeer.  This girl becomes his assistant and his artistic muse.  Chavalier does a great job in describing the sensuality of Griet.  There are scenes in the novel that send chills all through me.  Chavalier has the talent of turning a simple touch into the most intense experience imaginable.<br />My only complaint would be that I felt that there were times where Chavalier should have given us more insight into her characters. By her lack of doing this, I didn't find myself as emotionally invested in some of Griet's story altering events.<br />Overall, it was a good book.  I didn't want to put it down.	2001-11-23

The daughter of Jacob mentioned in the Bible.  There isn't much mentioned of Dinah in Genesis, but Diamant uses her brilliant talent and imagination to weave a story so heartwarming that you wish that it were actually in the Bible.<br />This story is told in Dinah's voice.  We get a look at how Dinah viewed her life as a child and young woman growing up in Canaanite society.  I was connected to Dinah and the story of her mothers from page one.  I was emotionally moved at practically every page.  One page I was smiling or laughing.  Another page, I was brought to tears.<br />A magnificent book!	2001-09-21

My family and I took our first vacation out of the country, and if it weren't for this book, I don't think I would have known half the things I needed to do to prepare for a trip out of the U.S.  My favorite section of the book was the countdown to travel.  In the countdown to travel section, it pretty much showed a timeline of things to accomplish during a certain time period before your vacation.  I also appreciated the packing list; however, as my daughter pointed out, pajamas are missing from that list, so don't forget to pack them!  (That is if you need them.)  Lastly, I found the sample itinerary very useful in planning out how to use our time on our vacation.<br />This book also has recommendations on choosing a vacation appropriate to your family; different travel options; and recommendations on finding appropriate food and lodging.  <br />All and all, I found this book to be a very useful travel tool.	2001-09-05

Annyrose starts off living with a woman by the name of O. O. Mary who treats her worse than an animal. One day, O.O. Mary hears that Joaquin Murieta is coming and he's looking for her. O. O. Mary sets Annyrose loose to fend for herself, and O.O. Mary escapes from town. Joaquin happens upon Annyrose and mistaking her for a boy he takes her off on his bandit's adventures throughout California during the Gold Rush Period.<BR>Annyrose is a proper, young girl who was raised to do the appropriate things. In the beginning of the novel, Joaquin and Annyrose understand very little about each other. It's interesting to watch their relationship grow througout the story.<BR>All the girls (average age, 10) liked the story tremendously; however, they all felt that it had a slow beginning. I do believe that the character of Annyrose was a wonderful main character and girls can find a lot of strength in this character.	2001-09-05

He said, &quot;Get that book. I promise you it will be the funniest thing you've ever read.&quot; It definitely wasn't the funniest thing I've ever read. I only found some of the anecdotes mildly amusing.<BR>If I had to say the story had a main character, I would have to say it was the young Louis Benfield, the narrator of the story. The book is pretty much a narration of his, first, second and third hand accounts of the goings on in his hometown of Neely, North Carolina. However, I never get an in depth look at young Louis Benfield or at any of the characters he describes. I also found that he threw so many characters at me that I didn't have the opportunity to get emotionally attached to any of them. The closest I came to an emotional connection would be to the character of his mother, and even then the emotional depth of her character fell short.<BR>I also had a hard time fixing a time period to the novel. At some points, I felt like I was reading a story set in the 30's and at other times, I'd notice years placed in, such as 1975 or 1980. This made me a bit more frustrated with the story because I found it hard to believe that anyone in the South could be that ignorant and simple minded during that time period. I never lived in the South, but both my parents were from small towns in the South and when I visited the South, I never saw instances like the ones described in this book. The people in this book just seemed too simple and bored for my liking.<BR>Overall, I was greatly disappointed.	2001-09-02

This book is worth it just for the advice on what sort of birthday party to throw for your child.  The birthday party recommendation section is definitely my favorite.  She explains exactly the sort of party a child this age can manage.  I've bought this book every year before my child's respective birthday, and each party I've planned according to this book has been a great success.<br />These books pretty much take you through the personality of your child by telling you how a typical child this age acts. She's pretty accurate in her assessments, and it's a great guide on how to react to different situations.  It also takes away the worry about your child's many mood changes.	2001-07-16

I like my daughter to work on all her projects independently with only minimal guidance from me.  There were concepts in this book that were difficult for her to understand, and I had to guide her through some of the ideas and explanations.<br />On a brighter side, she got an A on her project, and her teacher chose her project to display in the classroom as one of the teacher's favorite projects.	2001-07-16

If you are a fan of Poe's short stories, you'll definitely like this book.  I only had a few problems with the story.  There were times that the story dragged, but this is far outweighed by the times that the story was very exciting, and I couldn't put the book down.  I won't go into the ending, but it left me unsettled.<br />I found that the explanatory notes were very helpful.  I'm not a great scholar on any level, nor will I ever claim to be.

These characters are very lonely, and they seek out Singer because they believe that he's a safe character to tell their deepest, darkest, secrets to.  However, Singer, as he listens to these people, feels inside himself a deep loneliness.  He feels that he has nowhere to turn, so he silently just sits and politely reads the lips of his acquantances.<br />My favorite character in this novel was Mick Kelly.  She is a young girl of 14 who had many dreams and aspirations. Her mind constantly struggled with the concept of how to make her dreams a reality.  Her pure desire moved me tremendously.<br />I was disappointed with the book as a whole.  While, I enjoyed many aspects of the book, like the character development, I was disappointed with how most of the characters were pretty much left in limbo in the end.

Although, I didn't grow up in the late 50's and early 60's, I was able to relate to many of Dolores Price's experiences in her emotionally turbulent childhood.<br />Dolores' life revolved around hiding and trying to escape the pain of her childhood by using the few  tools that were available to her.  She felt pretty helpless, so she spent most of her life hiding in food or losing herself in television.  She did this because of a fear of being hurt by those around her, and she didn't have a strong adult to care for her emotional needs as a child.<br />The early part of this novel can be pretty emotionally draining.  Because the story is so well written, you feel as if you're with Dolores as she experiences every childhood trauma.  At points, you feel just as helpless as Dolores; however, once you pass the middle, the story's emotional level elevates, and it doesn't  tug at your heartstrings nearly as much as it does in the beginning.<br />All in all, it's a very well-written story; however, I wouldn't recommend it to any person who is struggling with the memory of child abuse or any other traumatic childhood experience.	2001-03-24

I personally liked that quality.<br />We read another book a few months ago entitled &quot;The Diary of Melanie Martin&quot;.  It was a book about a young girl's travels in Italy.  The girls in the book club enjoyed that one much more because they were able to get into the thoughts of the main character.

I'm sure if Vendela's adventures were more exciting than informative, they would have enjoyed the book more.	2001-02-09

The play is set in the bedroom of Elizabeth Barrett, and it tells of the dynamics of living in a home with a domineering father.  I felt deeply for Elizabeth's situation, and the fact that it's based on her actual life is amazing.  It helped me see how such great work can come forth from such a tortured soul.<br />The point where she meets Robert Browning warmed my heart and sent excitement through me as I read it.  Rudolf Besier did a wonderful job in conveying the depth of love and commitment of Robert Browning. I missed Robert Browning when he wasn't in a scene, and I relished every scene that had him.<br />Also, the scenes with Elizabeth's father were electrifying.  The way the play described the father's relationship with his children was very well done.  Besier definitely walked the line without being too obvious.<br />Overall this was a magnificent play.  I enjoyed it tremendously.	2001-02-07

The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it managed to keep me interested enough to finish the book.  While reading it, I kept asking myself &quot;How stupid can these people be?&quot;<br />I kept reading the book in hopes that any one of these characters would have some redeeming quality, but that never happened.  They were bad characters from Page 1.  Whenever I thought this book couldn't get any worse, it did.<br />I had no sympathy for the main characters.  They were pitifully self centered and constantly acted to their own demise. The character I came closest to feeling sympathy for was Behrani, but then the writer would invariably add a trait that would make me lose sympathy.<br />Also, Dubus' style of writing in changing from first to third person was highly frustrating and unsettling.  I wish he had just picked a style and stayed with it.<br />I was very unsatisfied with this story and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.	2001-02-04

I decided to read this book because I saw a trailor for the movie and figured that I would prefer to try the book for depth instead.  This was a story of a vibrant, strong woman, and I greatly appreciated that.<br />The main character, Vianne Rocher, moves into this small town in France and decides to open a chocolate shop.  She's a colorful woman who stands out in this gray, drab town but is determined to fit in without compromising her ideals.  I find the way she confonts opposition to be inspiring.  This was a highly moving book.  I actually believe I felt myself becoming a rebel as I turned the pages.	2001-01-05

I bought this book in hopes of getting some ideas on what to do to entertain 29 excited nine-year olds for two hours. I liked some of the game ideas in the book, however, I didn't find the book to have a decent party outline or schedule for these games and the like.  Luckily I've thrown many kids' parties, so I had a reasonable idea on how to schedule the party, although, I believe a beginner would be lost in party planning if that person depended solely on this book.	2001-01-03

All the girls were in the fourth grade.  The girls really enjoyed this book, and there were plenty of topics for them to relate to.  This was one of our longer running book club meetings.  It seems they all had points to make regarding dealing with siblings, neighbors, pets, and pesky moms.  <br />Personally, I liked the book but felt that the parental molds may be a little outdated.  I also had to explain to my daughter what green stamps were.  Talk about having your age thrown in your face!  Overall it was a good book though.  The girls really enjoyed it, and we moms had stories to relate from our younger days as well.	2000-12-06

I just don't buy books like this in the bookstore.  <br />My husband and I have a pretty good sex life, yet this title seemed intriguing to me.  We're both always so busy with work and kids that the thought of dedicating a weekend to sex seemed exciting.<br />When I approached my husband with this book, he wasn't as enthused as I was.  He said the title just put too much pressure on him for performance.  I asked him if he minded if I read the book and maybe used some of the recommendations for our anniversary weekend together.  He said he didn't mind, so I decided to go ahead and read on my own.<br />I read the book. I gathered together the the supplies necessary and packed them.  Friday night I followed course of the book with my husband eagerly obliging.  I guess he was pleased with the results because Saturday morning he wanted to know what else the book had to offer.  We had breakfast in bed and read the book and followed recommendations the rest of the weekend which was thoroughly enjoyable.<br />I highly recommend this book. I think it would be good for any couple in any state of their marriage.	2000-12-05

Out of the five girls, only one girl didn't like it, and we believe it's because she and Melanie were too much alike.  During the book club, they enjoyed talking about the poems Melanie wrote and trying to say the Italian words.  They related tremendously with Melanie and they were all very excited to discuss her adventures through Italy.	2000-11-17

All the girls, age 9, thought the book was spectacular.  I enjoyed the concept that Akiko was a girl on a quest to rescue the prince, as opposed to other stories where the girl is the princess waiting to be rescued.  I did find that we were a little light on character topics for the girls to relate to in real life, but it was a fun a little book for them to read.	2000-11-17

We never learned the true motivations for Tante Atie.  Nor did we get a true look into the Mother's nightmares.  I think character  development is a problem because we are looking at the story from the main  character's point of view.  However, I believe that Arthur Golden did a  much better job with &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;.  With  &quot;Memoirs&quot; Golden's character showed tremendous insight, while  with &quot;Breath, Eyes, Memory&quot; we are just getting a very distant  view of the characters.	1999-03-24

I was attached to the characters from page 1.  I felt as if I were growing up with Anju and Sudha.  I was deeply moved by the closeness of their relationship.  You  don't see many stories these days the demonstrate pure unconditional love  the way that Chitra Banerjee Davakaruni has with &quot;Sister of My  Heart.&quot;	1999-03-04
