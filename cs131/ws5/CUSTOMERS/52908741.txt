The rest of the first part is a filler -- everybody who works knows that there is no longer such thing as life-long employment.<br />The second part of the book is where the author, in my opinion, falls seriously short!

It is populated with a variety of assessment tools, it covers the basics, such as resume writing, cover letter writing, interviewing, negotions.<br />What holds the book back, in my opinion, is that it does not provide anything more than the basics -- surely, it's nicely illustrated and well written, but so are many other books in the field.

The description of the harrowing descent and sibsequent medical treatments will surely leave a long lasting trace in every reader's memory! What one must remember is that equipment, techniques and psychological perspectives  were different in the immediate post-WW II era than they are today in the time of guided expeditions. In reading this book, one gets a real sense of the true challenges experienced by the climbers.<br />While the book does not fall short in telling the story, it fails to provide an unbiased picture of the expedition and it's role in French society at the time. First of all, Herzog, for all his qualities, clearly orchestrated media attention, so that he will come out as the hero (at the airport prior to departure he had all other climbers sign releases authorizing only him to give first-hand account of the expedition). The national fervor following the success largely overlooks the achievements of other expedition members, including Lanchenal, Terry and Rebuffat.<br />Similarly to the first successful Italian expedition on K2 (where Compagnoni, Lacedeli and Desio get the credit, while Walter Bonatti's role is overlooked), here too the truly outstanding climbers prove only through their subsequent deeds (see &quot;Starlight and Storm&quot; by Rebuffat or &quot;Conquistadors of the Useless&quot; by Terray)their far superior mountaineering qualities.<br />In spite of all this, Herzog's book is, in my opinion, a must read for climbing enthusiasts.	2004-02-16

His feat of survival alone in a bivouac above 8,000 meters on Nanga Parbat is among the most remarkable achievements in the history of Himalayan Mountaineering!<br />And here is the most significant area where the book comes up short -- it devotes only a short section, at the very end of the book, to this remarkable expedition. Do not be mislead by the title -- this is not a book about this expedition -- it is an autobiography of Buhl, highlighting some of his remarkable achievements in climbing in the Alps.<br />My second concern about the book is related to the author's style. Of course, it is a matter of personal preference, but I find Buhl's writing as uninspired and dry, as his climbing capacities are outstanding. One simple comparison of the description of the same episode (climbing the north face of the Eiger) by Buhl as compared to that by Gaston Rebuffat (I highly recommend his book &quot;Starlight and Storm&quot;; they found themselves climbing the Eiger at the same time) clearly shows the much more inspired writing of the French (not to mention that Buhl does not even mention Rebuffat, a well known climber in the Alps by then, by name).<br />If you are really interested in Herman Buhl, I recommend &quot;Climbing Without Compromise&quot;, or the &quot;Kurt Diemberger Omnibus&quot;.	2004-02-16

His achievements (first French climb of the Walker Spur of the Grand Jorasses; first French Climb of the north face of Eiger, member of the Anapurna expedition) speak for themselves.<br />What also sets apart Rebuffat from many others (many climbers write books to underwrite financially their future expeditions or to underscore their achievements) is his joyful, honest and inspired writing. Rebuffat has a real talent to convey beautifully his emotions and leads us masterfully along his fascinating climbs.<br />This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in mountaineering, and I commend John Krakauer for including it in the new &quot;Exploration&quot; series!	2004-02-16

Along with Ricardo Cassin, Bonatti is perhaps the most outstanding Italian climber of all time! How ironic that he should become embroiled in one of the longest lasting (almost 50 years) controversies in mountaineering history, and how gratifying that he finally is clearly vindicated in this fascinating book.<br />The book is an autobiographical account of Bonatti's major climbs, including several sections on the much-discussed 1954 Italian expedition on K2. Bonatti clearly comes across as a committed climber, seeking purity and excitement in his climbs, who is often at a loss when faced with public criticism (on several accounts described in the book). As is often the case in the lives of people with outstanding talent, Bonati's life is beset by other people's envy and underhanded tactics, most frequently by his own compatriots. Yet, the book succeeds in demonstrating Bonatti's passion, drive and determination, while retaining the purity of mind and spirit that the mountains bestow on all!<br />Aside from being a highly personal account by one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, three things make this book outstanding:<br />(1) The beautiful translation by Robert Marshall (an Australian, who learned Italian for the sole purpose of reading mountaineering accounts!), who introduces each chapter with a short summary of the significance of the peak or route undertaken. Marshall also plays a key role of an &quot;investigator&quot; pointing out several pictures, which show that Compagnioni's and Desio's accounts of the K2 expedition are clearly false and manipulative;<br />(2) The book finally sets the record straight about the 1954 K2 expedition -- the fact that Lacedeli and Compaginoni used oxygen all the way to the top; the fact that they recklessly (if not intentionally) abandoned Bonatti in the bivouac, just feet from their warm tent above 8,000 meters; the fact that they manipulated accounts of the expedition to go as far as claiming that Bonatti wanted to charge ahead to the top on his own, endangering others. Two pictures, ironically published by Desio in an article immediately following the expedition clearly show Lacedeli and Compagnioni wearing oxygen masks at the top -- pictures, which are subsequently removed from Desio's book; and are only by accident discovered and brought forward by Rpbert Marshall only almost 50 years later! What a horrible thought that such an incredible climber, only in his 20s, could have been lost high up on K2, and we would have never come to know Bonatti as one of the all time greats! What a great feeling it is to know that truth sooner or later triumphs!<br />(3) the book is a true mountaineering story; it shows the aspirations, achievements and excitement of climbing in the immediate post- WW II era in Europe and Italy -- a period full of what is best about mountain climbing -- hope, innocence and passion!<br />This is a highly recommended book for everyone!

In the great tradition of English mountaineering tradition he tells with wit and humor about the scrambles in putting the expedition together. His storytelling about the trials and challenges in the walk-up to base camp is equaled in its jovial spirit perhaps only by Greg Child (see &quot;Thin Air&quot;).<br />When true drama begins to unfold with the death of Casarotto, Curran does not simply &quot;recount&quot; the casualties -- his voice is full of passion, heartache and doubt. His reflections upon the dangers of mountain climbing are deeply felt.<br />A highly recommended read!	2004-02-16

It's strengths are in its extensive description of French mountaineering in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Terray has been part of some of the major climbing endeavors in the Alps (the Walker spur on the Grand Jorasses or the north face of Eiger) as well as the first climb an 8,000 meter peak -- Anapurna. He also presents honest and direct portraits of some of his climbing partners, such as Rebuffat or Lachenal.<br />While the book has no particular weakness, in my view it falls far short of the inspired writings of some of his Frech contemporaries -- Gaston Rebuffat (&quot;Starlight and Storm&quot; -- highly recommended) or Maurice Herzog (&quot;Anapurna&quot; -- a riveting account of the expedition).	2004-02-16

What the authors produce are a series of capsules (2-4 pages for each CEO) which are descriptive of the CEOs and companies but have very little analysis.<br />It is in failing to use the resources at their disposal and access to some remarkable people to draw significant insights, that makes for the biggest shortfall of the book. One may just as well read a description of the CEOs or the companies in a business magazine or the Wall Street Journal.<br />There are no unique insights to be gained from this book. Yes, some of the CEOs provide some discussion points based on their experience, but much of the space is devoted to their company's specific problems at a particular time (thus leaders of questionable integrity, such as Ebbers and Lay were included).<br />What in my opinion the authors should have done is go above the specific company experience and focus on the qualities of these interesting individuals and show what has allowed them to have such significant impact on the business world and out society.<br />Unfortunately such insights are absent from the book.

Where the book falls somewhat short is in its explanation of why the debacle occurred and in the insights for regulators, market participants and others, as well as the legacy of this incident.<br />Otherwise, this is a great book for general audience.	2003-04-25

It covers in detail the history of the bank, paints portraits of some of the key players in some detail and presents a compelling overall picture of the bank's history.<br />Where the book falls short is in its financial and overall business details (compare to &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; by Niall Ferguson). Overall, and interesting and insightful read.	2003-04-25

Perhaps that is due to the length of time covered, or perhaps due to the relative decline of the Rothschilds in the world of finance. Still, this is a compelling story, which is skillfully narrated by Mr.Ferguson	2003-04-25

The book is informative, lively written and an excellent guide for both genders. As I examine myself and my relationships, I certainly encounter many of the gender-specific traits that Mr. Gray describes.<br />While one may argue that the descriptions are stereotypical, I believe they are nonetheless notable and make communication and interaction easier.	2003-04-25
US	52908741	R2OO96XP8MY441	0060541636	169285766	Model	Books	4	31	36	N	N	Informative historic review of modeling	The strong points of this book become easily evident if even one only looks at the several-page-long bibliography. Mr. Gross has done a commendable job of research and has presented a voluminous material, including multiple interviews, pictures, etc. From a historical standpoint, there is probably no better book written on the modeling business (particularly in the US).( There is actually and afterward to the paperback edition, which brins some current news as of 2002.)<br />The weak points of the book are rooted in its failure to discuss what its title promises -- \\"business\\". Yes, there are salary numbers, but that is about where Mr. Gross stops. In describing the business he talks at length about modelling agencies, magazines and the like, only it happens in a somewhat gossipy style (describing personalities, political battles, etc.), while failing to provide any financial (or any other business) information so as to give the reader an idea of, for example, of how big this business is. As a result, after reading the book, one is short of truly understanding how the business really works, including the interaction of its multiple participants, such as publihhers, designers, etc.	2003-04-21

This is exactly what Mr. Baer provides.<br />His prose is engaging, intelligent and forthright. Mr. Baer has managed to weave together his own experience as a clandestine manager in India, post-Soviet Union Tajikistan, Paris, Beirut and Iraq with the political intrigues taking place behind the scenes in Washington.	2003-04-21

If one is to believe Ms. Weisberger's claim (made on her appearance on the Today's show on NBC) that she wrote the book to provide an insight into fresh college graduate's experience on her first job, then this book is interesting (even though 99.9% of all graduates will have different experiences). What this book lacks is an in-depth description of the actual fashion business -- and Ms. Wiesberger apparently had unprecedented access to important sources. Regrettably she dwells on the idiosyncrasies of her boss' lunch orders, schedule, office politics and the like, leaving one to think what an intresting book this could have been had Ms. Weisberger taken the opportunity more seriously.	2003-04-21

It is an easy read, peppered with his strongly held personal opinions and receommendations for the reader. I believe that his style is a representation of his character -- open, honest without excuses. Whenever I thought his ego comes through too strong, I reminded myself that I have spent hundreds hours in from of the Bloomberg terminal in my professional life and that it is an outstanding and ever-changing product.<br />I would highly recommend this book to aspiring entrepreneurs, students of finance and anyone seeking a career in the banking or investing.	2003-02-27

Their satire is sharp and on point! All prospective and current MBA students should read it, as well as the general readers interested in the life of a WAll Street banker.<br />Not since &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; has a book protrayed so well the crazy lifestyle of bankers.	2003-02-27

I think he succeeds in that -- talking about her drive and insecurity. The book is an interesting read, however it falls short of puting Madonna in a broader perspective -- as a fascinating creation of American culture, as an entrepreneur and one of the notable pop music stars of the late 20th century. Other than her earnings and desire for control, Morton spends little time on the business aspects of Madona's success, which is no less fascinating than her musical accomplishments.	2003-02-25

What I found most appealing about the book is its comprehensive nature -- it weaves the family story in the context of the political and economic developments,with which it is closely intertwined. What is even more fascinating is the level of financial details about the bank than Ferguson provides. Perhaps it is his access to the recently open archive in Moscow that allows the author to deisclose finanacial history that it fascinating and detailed.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any serious student of history, as well as to people interested in banking and economics. Perhaps it may appear too detailed for the casual reader.	2003-02-25

While the chronology is fairly informative, I feel that it focuses more heavily on the personal relationships in Lauren's life. The book falls short in its description of the creative process that Lauren uses and the source of his inspiration and his ability to reinvent itself. The discussion on the business and financial aspects of Lauren's success is fit more for a magazine article than a serouos biographical study -- don't look for any insights here either.	2003-02-25

His book achieves a nice blend of factual information (based on a wealth of background research) with fluid prose, making the book as informative as it is easy to read! Having come from that reagion myself, I was nicely suprised to learn new details, yet I was even more excited about Mr. Fromkin's discussion on the British political approach (an ignorance) about the region, which is painted in vivid color through discussions about the major political figures in the landscape. I am hard pressed to find a book on the subject with similar depth and readability, so I highly recommend it!	2002-07-08

Shaw is very purposeful in explaining the basics and supporing them with magnificent visual clues. What makes Shaw unique is his ability to intermingle the practical aspects of photography (exposure, equipment, composition) with the artistic vision.

Topics range from very practical, e.g. suggestions on what equipment to bring, to esoteric, e.g. physical and ppyshological aspect of light.
