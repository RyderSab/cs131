US	50776825	R3H3OKIKSOZXD0	0922915008	485337376	Satanic Witch	Books	3	9	15	N	N	Not his best effort, but some parts are worth a read	LaVey makes good use of the old cliche, &quot;Opposites attract&quot; in this manual. He is basically advising women how to manipulate men to get what they want. Chapters are devoted to his weird theory of the inner man,  inner woman, etc. in each of us and how this is supposed to be valuable  knowledge in charming the opposite sex. He catagorizes body types and other  certain traits onto the face of a clock stating everyone must fit  somewhere. This horoscope mumbo jumbo is just like astrology; fitting into  one of the twelve slots and being predisposed to certain behavior patterns.  Even more silly is the presumption that you just look to the opposite side  of the clock for your type of mate. If you don't fit into the opposite  category, LaVey suggests changing yourself into the opposite type to appeal  to that person. He manages to squeeze entire chapters out of this simple  premise that is based on an old wive's tale. As usual the few good parts in  this book are when Lavey is at his rawest and honest best. Suggesting ways  to dress and act are the age old requirements for attracting people and  LaVey pulls no punches in what works and what doesn't. If you are a LaVey  fan, you should like this book, else don't waste your money.	2000-07-28

This highly detailed book takes you through their childhood right up to the ending courtroom drama of  Artie's death. The research done is incredible, up to the point of being  boring. The author spends too much time dwelling on the details of Artie's  various girlfriends and not enough on the adult entertainment industry in  general. 450 pages is suitable for a scholarly textbook, not an  autobiography written for entertainment. This is the only fault I found  with this book. A pleasant surprise is the courtroom drama and how the  author takes you through the entire trial and weaves the suspense all  throughout. Extremely entertaining and you will become engrossed in the  fine presentation. We also learn about the Mitchell's wild lifestyle and  how their successful empire was built. In the end we learn an alarming  lesson about our legal system and how justice is bought in America. This  book is a great read if you have the patience to make it through some of  the boring sections.	2000-05-15

This book will help you understand why. It was interesting all the way through and the woman has definitely lived an incredible life. You may not agree with  Annie's views or lifestyle, but you should support her First Amendment  right to do so. I have a problem with public tax dollars funding the NEA  though. One man's art is another man's bird cage lining. Successful artists  in any society/time period create what the public wants just like any other  profession. So why are they eligible for a public handout? I don't consider  what Annie does as art, but that's my opinion. She sure is the subject of a  great story though!	2000-05-08

The memory lingers strongly to this day. You are drawn into the pages by the realism and situations that King weaves. Who can forget the awkwardness and  cruelties we all faced in high school. We all knew someone like Carrie who  was the brunt of the most cruel jokes and pranks. I say the movie did not  do justice to the book. For one thing a movie cannot capture the emotion  and clarity of things that King so masterfully writes. It's no wonder he  became the great author he is today. A sheer masterpiece like this one is a  real credit to his talent.	2000-03-23

He tells an honest story about his life and career as a bodybuilder back in a time when bodybuilding was considered strange and obscure. Arnold helped shatter all the myths and stereotypes about the sport and  realistically tells us how gruelling and demanding the sport really is. He  is correct in accessing that certain body types have a better chance at  succeeding while others have many obstacles to overcome. Sheer muscle mass  is only part of the sport. Just as important is definition and symmetry.  Arnold was blessed with just about perfect body symmetry so he was a  natural. This doesn't mean he didn't work hard. In fact you'll gather  inspiration as you read about him always pushing himself and striving to do  better. Arnold is also not shy about some of the seedier elements that were  around at the time he was in competition. Promises of contracts,  endorsements, and money could disappear as fast as the unscrupulous  businessman who took advantage of them. This is a great book about a great  man and brought bodybuilding the dignity it deserves.	2000-03-23

I read the original version of this book as a curious teenager. I became the envy of the neighborhood with my ability to answer my school chums &quot;dirty&quot; questions. This book was a very important release that shocked prudes everywhere and flew off the bookshelves at the same time.  Alot of the information was factual, but alot was biased, especially about  gay people. This certainly had an impact on America's homophobia in  general. Still, I'm thankful I had this book to learn from when young  instead of the lies and misinformation when you &quot;learn&quot; about sex  like all the guys did.	2000-03-23

A fascinating book for any owner or dreamer of the 90-96 Z cars. Filled with great facts and stories. Especially interesting is the initial goal the Company set for itself in designing the world's number one sports car. You learn how various designs and decisions were made in developing this  legend. You also learn about the men behind the car and how they all  contributed to it's success. This Z car always won Car and Driver's top 10  award every year and for good reason. You can buy more expensive cars, and  you can buy more exotic and faster, but dollar for dollar the Z car is  truly the best sports car in the world. I just wish this book wasn't so  short in length, but like all great reads, you finish and want more.	2000-03-23

I'm tired  of people saying statistics can be manipulated any way you want to. That is  an ignorant observation. Facts are facts and if research is done carefully  and logically, then the results cannot be disputed. This book plainly shows  tireless research and an impressive accumulation of information. But what  can we draw from the findings? To say that all Asians are smarter than  Whites and all Whites are smarter than Blacks is ridiculous and certainly  not the direction of this book. What is laid plain is on the whole Asians  score a little higher than Whites on IQ tests and Whites score a little  higher than Blacks. Raw intelligence is certainly a desirable human trait  and plays an important role in how a person develops in life. However,  other factors such as motivation, environment, parenting, etc. also are  critical in shaping people. Simply said, the more positive aspects of these  traits you have going for you, the better your chance is for succeeding  above others. The question of why is there a racial division in  intelligence can be answered by looking at history. When you look back in  time as to where various groups and societies stood in terms of discovery,  inventions, education, and other noble human endeavors, it's plain to see  that being a member of the groups that had advanced farther than others  would tend to predispose you towards having higher intelligence, especially  since intelligence tends to be hereditary. I believe this whole common  sense observation was what The Bell Curve was trying to get across to us.	2000-03-16

Scott's incredible Oscar winning performance as Patton? Yet few people remember that the movie came mostly from this book and Omar Bradley's input. Patton was one of the most eccentric, brilliant,  egotistical generals ever. This fine book takes you through his upbringing  to his last days after the war.

Entire chapters of gibberish that I'm sure groveling followers have spent years trying to  decipher. Like Anton Lavey, Crowley was a master trickster in his time.  They were both brilliant philosophers and were too smart to believe in  silly occult dabblings. They did it to make a buck and gain a following.  This was the second and last Crowley book I'll ever read.	2000-02-25

This is definitely Crowley's easiest to read book as it doesn't delve into his usual mystic mumbo-jumbo. The story is enchanting and you are swept up into the pages about the ecstacy and agony of drug usage. The realism  presented here no doubt stemmed from Crowley's own dabbling with the  various powders. This book won't appeal to everybody, but it is a good  novel with an important message about what drugs can do by an eccentric,  unusual character.	2000-02-25

Pumping Iron changed all that with it's realistic look at the sport with many pictures of the champions of the 70's  &amp; early 80's at work and play.

It's hard to determine just where the facts stopped and the sensationalized gossip starts, but for the most part alot of the information can be verified by research. Plain  dull facts do not sell books so Anger cannot be blamed for adding some  spice to these stories. This is actually a good study of human nature and  how a privileged few behave when they hit the big time, then react when the  inevidible fadeaway comes. Many parallels can be found in sports and the  music industry where sudden fame and wealth changes people. People will  always be fascinated with the lifestyles of their heroes and idols. Anger  does a good job of dishing up the aspects these idols don't want their  adoring public to know.	2000-02-24

While some jokes are subjective, there are some that just plain split your sides and I didn't find myself laughing hard all the way through this rather small collection. Plus times change.

Anyone who truly loves their pet will be deeply moved and touched by these stories. There is inspiration, joy, love, and sadness in these pages, but they all reflect the wonders of our pets and how fortunate we are to have them. Some people don't understand how and why I treat my pets so lovingly  and consider them my family. The biker cliche is appropriate here; &quot;If  I have to explain, you wouldn't understand.&quot; Also, my own personal  philosophy applies; &quot;I never met anything on four legs I didn't like.

A timeless classic that is mandatory reading in many schools for good reason. Not only is this a well written story, but the plot borders on great science fiction. Who hasn't dreamed of some type of miracle  &quot;pill&quot; that could increase brain power! A very realistic look at  human intelligence and the author writes brilliantly from both mind  perspectives of the dumb and smart Charley. The ending is not too  depressing because Charley resorts back to the lovable character he was.  Definitely a great read for anybody.	2000-02-03

His forensic background only heightens his credibility and serves to convince you even more as you read  this intrigueing story. Thomas goes to great lengths to reconstruct what  actually happened in those last few weeks in the bunker and afterwards, and  is quite convincing in doing so.

Some people may doubt the authenticity of Sam and Chuck, but a  lot of what they said can be verified. If they put spin on their stories is  another matter, but anytime you read a book like this you have to analize  it carefully. One thing is for sure, you will come to understand who really  pulls the strings in Washington. In fact the only difference between  Organized Crime and the U.S. Government is the Government robs people  legally. I thought this book pretty accurately shows us a most notorious  gangster and how his empire worked, corrupted, and influenced. Great mob  history reading.	2000-01-14

The verbal comments are also listed. What's really interesting is studying their facial expressions in many of these  which we tend to overlook when watching their fast paced routines on film.

But it borrows too heavily from the good versus evil earlier theme of Damien's guardians striking down anybody who learns of his dark secret. This story is  interesting because young Damien finally comes to realize who he is and  gradually accepts it, then relishes it.

Thompson takes us through some typical days of a modern private detective and soon we realize the old stereotype of a  seedy office, bottle of bourbon, fast fists, and a Colt .45 belongs  strictly in a '40's detective movie. Thompson points out that the computer  is the &quot;weapon&quot; of choice now and it is the staple of the  profession. Information gathering is what a detective is paid for and by  networking with other computer users and agencies they carve out a living.  If you want glamour and excitement, watch an old Bogie black and white. But  if you want a true and factual account of what a private eye does and how  they work then read this.	2000-01-14

I think the events and anecdotes are pretty accurate, but during the whole read we don't really  learn much except some dry information. Morrison was definitely an  intelligent man and much different than some of the posers passing for rock  artists these days. His mind and music ran deeper than most and this book  didn't really do him justice. I give it three stars for basic content  though.	2000-01-14

But the stage was set and somebody had to step up and write the next sequel. Now we find Damien as a powerful adult, following the same tired  plot of striking down anybody that stands in his way. There just isn't the  gut-wrenching suspense in this effort and I found the whole effort, if you  can call it that, disappointing.	2000-01-14

Nothing like a good ol' boogeyman masquerading as a priest to  thump on his Bible and warn us of the evils in this world that will engulf  us if we don't hand blank checks to our local Church! Malachi Martin spewed  his rhetoric like Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, and other great con men who  know how to keep their money coffers full.

Howarth has also devoted a considerable part  of his life to studying this era, and these two strong points make up a  fantastic historical work. He has really sifted through the information out  there to come up with one of the finest historical books ever written.  History is only as good as the people who wrote it, and the farther we go  back in time, the more this information can change or have a biased spin.  Howarth is a true historian and any student of history should read this  work and appreciate the effort and style.	2000-01-11

No wonder American students can't compete with foreign students, because wonderful books like this aren't available to them. This is one of the best ever books about explaining a complex scientific theory to ordinary people  with no scientific background, but a good head on their shoulders. I've  treasured my copy over the years and have referred to it many times when I  needed to set my thinking straight while reading advanced cosmology works.  This should be a supplemental textbook in every high school science class.	2000-01-11

This book will convince you that the greatest philosophers in the world left their marks on bathroom walls!  A hilarious account of graffiti, and much of it will have you howling with laughter. The author tends to take  the subject a little too serious at times by tracing and documenting  historic examples of graffiti. This adds considerable size to the book and  adds some dry, boring reading. But for the most part, you will be laughing.  A great volume to stash in your magazine rack in the bathroom!	2000-01-11

For the most part, Warhol gives us a unique look into the complex smarmy world of the celebrity set. He goes into great detail almost on a daily basis of what he did, who he met, his opinions and reactions, etc.  Sometimes it gets a little boring, and other times you devour the pages. I  found it very hard to swallow about his so called revelation of not using  drugs. Either he was carefully concocting this lie or the editors wanted to  add more credibility to his stories by omitting any drug usage he probably  was doing while running around with the jet set. Still Andy was one of the  most colorful and lovable characters ever to emerge from the 60's.	2000-01-05

There are some fine gripping works in this volume like the first and second, but some of them are  starting to look tired and uninspiring. Could it be that Frazetta's  commercial success is now affecting his talent? Still a must have for  Frazetta fans though.	2000-01-05

In this first volume you'll see some of his finest. His techniques for drawing your attention to primary and secondary points of interest in his works are done  beautifully like a photographer uses light. His works are lush and sensual,  celebrating the human anatomy like the ancient Greeks. The facial  expressions of his subjects convey intensity, strength, and will. You can  actually feel the energy jumping out at you. Too bad it's out of print, but  I suspect these masterpieces will be popping up frequently in various  compilations.	2000-01-05

I remember back when this book hit the best seller list and everybody was reading it. Alot has changed since then, especially in the auto industry. Now this book will be taken more for it's historic value than how business  currently operates. Management techniques have changed drastically and  Iaccoca is no longer head of Chrysler, but he is an interesting man and  tells us quite a good story. This is also a fine study of what was wrong  with American car companies and why they couldn't seem to compete in the  70's and 80's. Car buffs will especially be attracted to this book, but it  definitely has universal appeal.	2000-01-05

Feynman's egotistic attitude gets annoying for time to time, but I suppose he was entitled to this other  &quot;quirk&quot; in his multi-faceted personality. Very good supplemental  reading for any serious student of science to remind them not to take life  too seriously.	2000-01-01

I knew car salesmen and dealerships were sleazy and this book confirms it. I didn't rate it 5 stars because I felt it lacked detailed  information on what dealers really pay for cars. Of course this will vary  depending on how much and what kind of units they buy, but surely there are  some standards that weren't revealed here. But all the other content scores  big and you will learn things you never knew about the business.	2000-01-01

I read this book many years ago, but it's impact on me was so powerful that I vividly remember it to this day. Yes it is long and the material is now dated, but the overall content is something every American citizen  should read. It will open your eyes to what a farce the so called  &quot;war&quot; on drugs really is in this country. It's understandable how  our government caves into the corruption when you look at the staggering  amounts of money and power plays involved. The now dissolved Centac  organization (the focus of this book) is about the only U.S. government  agency worth the tax dollars. Their approach was to go after the top men,  unlike the DEA and police system making small/mid-level busts every now and  then to get good news coverage, while they continue taking their kickbacks  and ignoring the kingpins and tons of drugs coming in. This book will make  you ripping mad and scare the hell out of you at the same time.	2000-01-01

He paints a good  picture of all the ups and downs of playing and gives fair warnings to all  young players fortunate to rise to the pro level.

It was a pity to delve into this work of short essays and find myself saying  over and over, &quot;What the hell is he talking about?&quot; He has  departed much from his usual crystal clear, in-your-face logical approach  and adopted a confusing contradictory style of presenting topics.

Paul Castellano led an incredible life and you won't be able to put this book down. Those FBI  guys went into great detail about the countless hours they spent gathering  evidence and the supreme achievment of planting a bug in Castellano's  kitchen. A great psychological triumph deducing that Castellano being the  recluse he was, spent alot of time in his kitchen holding his meetings  there. The brutal goings on of the underworld are exposed  and you realize  how cheap life can be in organized crime. A must read for anyone interested  in the state of organized crime before John Gotti.	1999-12-23

This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is  one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The  way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the  heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The  courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the  tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot  about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior.  What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles  Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding.	1999-12-22

Hoover was a fascinating character and stopped at nothing in his quest for power. He was able to dig up so  much dirt on any and every politician, that nobody ever dared to challenge  him in the smallest way, unless they wanted to commit career suicide. This  important book reveals what really goes on in Washington and how even  Presidents can become mere pawns on the chessboard.

This book is the &quot;Bible&quot;  of all handgun stopping power studies. In clear common sense approach and  tons of statistics and research, Marshall shows why jello blocks and other  methodologies come up short. You can't dispute actual shootings, and  Marshall carefully pored over thousands of police shootings to find out  what different bullets do in a typical one shot incident.

Billy Maples  is the best forensic anthropologist alive and he also has a gift for  writing and conveying his thoughts in a clear and entertaining manner. This  subject won't interest everyone and many will be put off by some of the  gory details, but Maples doesn't glamorize or exaggerate, he tells it like  it is.

It's a  good thing Wilt wasn't around in Biblical times, imagine what tall tales  we'd find in the Bible if he was!	1999-12-15
US	50776825	R3RVHCR6P123VG	0671004107	860650224	Contact	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A great cosmologist can also write great fiction.	Normally, I don't read fiction, but when the author is Carl Sagan, I stand up and take notice. And Contact is well worth it to. What makes it even better is Sagan's accurate scientific detail that applies to the situation  he is creating, although few people can appreciate this. Much like watching  Star Trek, the scientific inaccuracies don't get in the way of a great  series, but it sure would've enchanced it more!	1999-12-15
US	50776825	R3XZJDY6CT17F	0385420536	626095980	Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography	Books	5	8	13	N	N	The standard on which everything else pales in comparison	At last, the most factual, unbiased, historical work ever written about one of history's most misunderstood men. Few people know about Hitler's bravery and love for his country. Although his rise to power was by  questionable means, he turned a bankrupt, desolate nation into one of the  greatest countries in the world. If Hitler didn't get greedy and start  World War II, he would have gone down in history as one of the greatest  leaders ever. From Hitler's birth to the final bunker, Toland shines in his  insatiable quest for facts and information and has produced one of the  finest historical accounts ever written.	1999-12-15

The lessons to learn are profound and this book should be required reading in high school. It still is a great read now that I'm older, but young people  with a good head on their shoulders will gain the most from this fine book.	1999-12-15
US	50776825	R1YIZE7U0A4T2X	0312968388	983898565	Sex Lives of the Presidents: An Irreverent Expose of the Chief Executive from George Washington to the Present Day	Books	5	15	17	N	N	An amazing account	I thought this might be a tabliod type expose, but to my delight, it really is a thorough, factual work. Each and every president is covered and the historic research is evident. Many sections are dry and boring only  because those presidents weren't particularly sex driven men. But the  notable exceptions like Lyndon &quot;Bull Nuts&quot; Johnson, Jack Kennedy  and others make this an eye opening and shocking account of what our  presidents really are doing behind closed doors. After reading this book,  you want to give this country back to King George! 5 stars to Nigel for his  tireless research and fact finding.	1999-12-15

Sagan's gifted style of writing manages to take difficult topics and present them in a readable, fascinating, and thought provoking manner. Sagan's works should be required reading in any high school science class.	1999-12-15

Not only was Dr. Sagan a brilliant cosmologist and thinker, he had a gift for writing and explaining things on a par with Isaac Asimov. The essays in this book will make you think deeply and make you realize how insignificant  we and this little ball of dirt we live on truly are!	1999-12-15
US	50776825	RH66L8LID8G68	0553292153	720300590	Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth, and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century	Books	5	10	16	N	N	Should be required reading in every high school in America.	As in Future Shock, Toffler once again brilliantly lays out the future scenario. You'd swear this guy has a crystal ball, ESP, or some strange gift that allows him to write so clearly and correct. In addition to his  accurate extrapolations, he also proposes different outcomes and  consequences depending on what paths we take on the whole. An absolute  masterpiece!	1999-12-15

I first read this book before I got into motorcycling and didn't fully appreciate the biker situations. Later on in the book it gets silly/confusing with the ghost Phaedrus. Perhaps Pirsig got carried away on  the philosophical angle. He should have kept it simpler and more meaningful  like Hermann Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot;.	1999-12-15
US	50776825	R2NN1QD2839BJ1	0922915121	554659728	The Secret Life of a Satanist: The Authorized Biography of Anton LaVey	Books	4	19	24	N	N	An entertaining read about an entertaining man.	The majority of reviewers on LaVey's books usually fall into 3 categories; 1) Slobbering, groveling, worshipping followers of anything he said or did. 2) Pseudo-intellectuals trying placate their egos with supposedly  intelligent perspectives on LaVey. 3) Slobbering, groveling, worshipping  religious Jesus-junkies denouncing everything about LaVey. Why can't people  just accept him for what he was; a colorful character with a brilliant  philosophical outlook on life. Much can be gained by reading his views, but  to make a religion out of it is the greatest trick he ever pulled off.	1999-12-14

A very fascinating account of arguably porn's greatest legend. We learn quite a lot about the man and the incredible life he lived. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I hungered for more material that sadly John took  to the grave with him.	1999-12-13
US	50776825	R1B7FNW5I5C2ZS	0380015390	52596332	The Satanic Bible	Books	4	6	9	N	N	A Great Philosophical Work minus one star	All the pretenders are blown away, and I do mean all of them, by LaVey's brutal honesty and realistic outlook of life and what people really are. I suspect the people who criticize LaVey subscribe to the religious dogma  that places man on a pedestal. Every word he wrote is truth and he had a  real gift for getting his ideas across. I gave it a minus one star because  of the content on magic. How such a brilliant man could also preach  hocus-pocus I'll never know, but my guess is he did it to make a buck and  develop a following.	1999-12-13
