Mrs. Cotten's writing is very conversational, but once I had warmed to it, reading her book was like listening to the rememberances of a close friend.  Mrs. Cotten tells all about her childhood with loving parents and an amazingly close relationship to her sisters, being in England during WWII, and her first marriage, all with candor and honesty.  We follow her to Hollywood as she tells of her adventures as a divorcee who never planned to remarry.  Enter Joseph Cotten.  When she is writing about him the reader cannot help but be enthralled by the beauty of their relationship.  They marry and enjoy many happy healthy years together until illness intervenes.  In the last half of the book \\"Only When I Cry\\" Patricia recounts her many years nursing the man she loved so deeply as he valiantly struggled back from a stroke and fought cancer.  The heartbreak she felt watching the love of her life in such condition while struggling to keep him fighting is movingly conveyed.  You sense that Mr. Cotten, though he had to be in tremendous pain and discomfort during his final years, fought so courageously so that he could be with Patricia for as long as he could.  Ultimately he passed away in 1994 with Patricia at his side and she wrote these memoirs as a sort of therapy.  I came into this book not knowing much about Mr. or Mrs. Cotten and came away from it in awe. Mrs. Cotten's life was exciting and adventurous, but she never lost sight of the importance of love or family (she even refused several large film roles because she would not havebeen able to go home for Christmas)and worked tirelessly to see that Mr. Cottens last days were as he wished and preserved his dignity.  Mr. Cotten's capacity for love and generosity are overwhelming.  I was also left with added respect for Jennifer Jones, who proved to be the best friend to the Cottens and Robert Wagner for his gracious last encounter with Mr. Cotten, among several others who helped keep Mr. Cotten's spirits up.  All in all a wonderful book from a wonderful woman about a life with an amazing man!	2005-09-25

The book is only 15 pages, and contains only 6 illustrations, but it is well worth the money for the beautiful images.  The photographs were taken in 1964 when Sharon was 21.  For the most part, they feature Sharon amidst elements of nature.  My favorite photograph is one of Sharon shielding her face from the sun (black and white, folds out).  Also included is a short essay on the brilliance of photographer Walter Chappell and his images of Sharon.  My only wish is that a larger collection of Sharon Tate images would be released.  Sharon Tate lived 26 years before the one night that took her life and it is time that more books like this which celebrate the beauty of her life rather than the horror of her death be released!	2002-11-18

This collection of photographs focuses on her life with Richard Burton, when she was at the height of her beauty.  Bozzacchi's photos are a mixture of famous pictures (such as the one on the cover) as well as some that are more rarely seen.  My favorite picture is the one of Elizabeth holding the pearls over her eyes...her beauty is truly amazing!<BR>Also recommended is &quot;My Love Affair With Jewelry&quot; by Elizabeth Taylor herself...the two books make for a definitive collection of pictures of Elizabeth.	2002-10-30

This book is rich with photograph after photograph of the beautiful jewelry collection of the equally beautiful Elizabeth Taylor.  Featured with the pictures of each piece are her stories or recollections that go along with it.  There are pictures of the piece alone as well as pictures of Elizabeth wearing the pieces.  I disagree with the reviewer who says that this is selfish book, as Elizabeth Taylor gives much of her time and money to charitable causes and each book includes a request for donations to her AIDS fund.  Also, she held an auction of some of her pieces for charity in connection with the release of this book.  So, this was not an entirely greedy endeavor for her.  This book is a treasure as Elizabeth allows us a peek at her AMAZING collection.  She is famous for letting people try on her jewelry and this is as close as some of us will ever come to that!  Thank you, Elizabeth!!!	2002-10-22

This is a book for the serious TV and trivia fan.  It is essentially a book of lists that are highly entertaining to anyone who truly enjoys the TV Land Channel (I do).  They recall things such as the 12 worst movies based on TV Series, the 8 Least memorable TV Shows of All Time (how sad is it that I remember some of them!), and culminates in the 100 best sitcom episode of all time.  If you love TV Land or long for the glory days of Nick at Nite, you will like this book!	2002-09-27

I work as a makeup artist and I love the creative makeup applications throughout this book.  I also love the way the book is set up.  On the left page you see the woman with no makeup.  On the right page is the woman wearing makeup.  In between is a clear plastic page that can be placed over the photo with makeup to show exactly which colors were applied where.  It is really ingenious!  However, I could see that it would be very difficult if not a little avant gard for those who are novices with makeup, but if you love to have fun with makeup or are a makeup professional such as myself, you will love it!	2002-09-27

All of the Hollywood golden age stars are featured: Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons, Natalie Wood, Ava Gardner.  The photos catch the personal side of the stars, such as the photo of Richard Burton strapped into an airline seat along with his daughter's doll, as well as their entrances into glamourous events.  He also adds his personal recollections such as Ava Gardner's love of jokes, off color or not, Eve Arden's love of her daughter, the secrecy of Natalie Wood's 21st birthday party.  The stories are fascinating.  The pictures are beautiful and unique.  I am glad Murray decided to share them with us.	2002-09-27

Let me begin by saying that, as a huge vintage film fan, any book that features chapters devoted to both Norma Shearer and Kay Francis between its covers is perfect in my opinion.  So now that you know that I am not an impartial judge, I have to tell you this book is fabulous.  Annette Tapert did not focus on the cliche glamourous women, she focuses on the often times forgotten glamour girls, such as the aforementioned Norma Shearer and Kay Francis, as well as Dolores Del Rio and Constance Bennett.  The book has fabulous photographs and a detailed biography of each glamourous woman.  And, glamourous they were! All of the women featured here have left their mark on film and fashion through the years and deserve to be recognized as icons of glamour!	2002-09-27

Rita Hayworth is one of the most beautiful and glamourous women ever to have lived.  Though her life was marked by tragedy, particularly her Alzheimer's affliction and death at a relatively young age.  This book, however, is mainly devoted to celebrating Rita's happier times.  Her life is viewed chronologically in both popular and rare photographs.  There are so many beautiful photos that it is difficult to take in all at once!   My favorite pictures (and just a sampling of the pictures you will find in this book) are: Rita (when she was still Margarita) with her dark hair dancing in a beautiful ruffled dress (p.28), glamourous Rita smiling brightly while reclining on a couch (p.87), Rita clowning with Orson Welles (pg. 114), Rita getting her hair touched up (p. 119), Rita tickling her daughter Rebecca (p. 126), Rita walking solitarily on the beach (p. 140), Rita being welcomed home (p. 165), and Rita in 1981, in declining mental health, but still looking every inch a movie star.  If you love Rita and her movies, do not hesitate to buy this book!!!	2002-09-27

This book happened to be published at a time when several of my friends were getting married and it makes an excellent bridal shower gift for the friend who loves old movies.  This book is similar in set up to Schreier's other great book \\"Hollywood Dressed & Undressed\\" in that there are photos of movies with a bit of text and director and costuming credits.  It is a simple set up, but it lets you view the fabulous wedding scenes in films through the years, such as \\"Haystacks and Steeples\\" (1916) or \\"Show People\\" (1928) up to newer films like \\"Where The Heart Is\\" (2000) or \\"Runaway Bride\\" (1999).  Scattered throughout are photos of real celebrity weddings such as that of Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg (1927) or Shirley Temple and John Agar (1945).  Great book by this great fashion historian who owns the largest private collection of 20th century couture!	2002-09-27

I think there are few individuals who came as close to perfection in both beauty and personality as Audrey Hepburn.  This book proves my point.  Audrey was so incredibly beautiful that a bad photograph was probably impossible to take of her!  Bob Willoughby shares his collection of photographs with us and it is a real treasure.  Though the photos span a relatively short period of time in her life, they are nonetheless glimpes of Audrey both on and off screen.  Both black and white and color photographs are featured.  My favorite photos are the ones of Audrey in \\"Two For The Road\\", which is, by the way, one of the best films I have ever seen.  If you love Audrey, BUY this book!!!

There is a wide variety of photographs exhibited here.  My only complaint would be that they are not set up in any kind of order.  A picture of Jack Nicholson playing golf on one page and then turn the page to find a picture of Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  I suppose they thought chronological or theme order would have been too predictable.  My favorite photos are: Doris Day (p. 26), the essay and photo of Greta Garbo (pgs. 42-43), James Dean clowning (p. 47), Jayne Mansfield and Sophia Loren (p.158) the Malibu Beach drawing from 1933 (p.242), Sophia Loren (p. 247), Jackie Cooper and Mickey Rooney (p. 276), Loretta Young in 1935 and 1999 (pgs.292 and 293) and Olivia de Havilland (p. 310).  As you can tell, my interests are toward vintage photos, but there are photos of today's celebs as well, such as Gwyneth Paltrow or Cameron Diaz and these are wonderful photos, too.  The pictures in Vanity Fair are always unique and this is a great compilation.	2002-09-27

Each feature has at least one photograph (generally more than one) as well as a brief biography and some &quot;Did You Know?&quot; trivia.

Coco Chanel, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Diana Vreeland...these names recall the very essence of style.

Each chapter celebrates a different lady with wonderful photographs and detailed text of their lives and what made them the &quot;women who defined the art of living well&quot;.  Also recommended is Tapert's follow-up book &quot;The Power of Glamour&quot; which looks at the women of film, as opposed to the women of society.  Both are great books about great women!	2002-09-27

The story is exactly what the title states, \\"Ava Gardner's North Carolina Childhood and Her Enduring Ties To Home\\".  This biography puts most of its focus on Ava's childhood and how it shaped her attitudes toward her life and her fame.  Although the last third of the book overviews her life as a star, if you are looking for a detailed account of Ava's Hollywood life, this is not the book for you.  This is simply the story (told mainly through antecdotes and memories of family and friends) of a woman with strong roots who happened to become a movie star but who never forgot where she came from. The author introduces the reader to Ava's North Carolina family and friends and I love the fact that she tells the reader what happened to everyone mentioned in the book. I have a whole new respect and perspective for Ava Gardner.  I was really struck by the fact that even though Ava became a big star, she never thought of herself as any better than anyone else and continued to be a loving and supportive friend, sister, and aunt.   The book is short (about 130 pages, I read it in two nights, maybe took 3 hours total) and has some great pictures throughout.  I highly recommend it!!!	2002-09-26

The ideas are great for both apartments (if your apartment lets you paint, you will love all the ideas) and houses.  This book has totally changed what I look for in furniture, both new and vintage, and shown me how to &quot;think outside the box&quot; in decorating more than ever before.  The pictures of other people's &quot;Paris Apartments&quot; are extremely inspirational.  If nothing else, this book is worth the price just for the pictures, and, though small, it makes an excellent coffee table book.  I love it!	2002-08-29

The book is packed with charming stories that will make you both laugh and cry.  Lee was priveleged to be with Lucy at some of her highest moments, like receiving the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as some of her lowest, such as the debacle of &quot;Life With Lucy&quot;, her failed last sitcom.  Lee's love for Lucy, both the person and the image, are obvious in every page, but he does not gloss over Lucy's sometimes strong temperment.  Also, interesting is Lee Tannen's depiction of his own relative, Gary Morton, Lucy's husband; Lucy's admiration and respect for the late Vivian Vance; her statements about Desi Arnaz and her children; and Lucy's obsession with backgammon.  This is a wonderful book about a wonderful lady...any Lucy fan should read it!	2002-01-07

Marlene Dietrich was every inch a movie star and this look insider her personal keepsakes is truly fascinating.  This book boasts 289 photographs from the stars collection with captions written by her daughter, Maria Riva, as well as looks at some of the gorgeous gowns she wore in films and on stage throughout the years, letters sent to her by her lovers and friends, and other objects she kept through her whole life (including a gold bracelet she gave to Ernest Hemingway during WWII that was inscribed &quot;Think of me, Papa, and be safe&quot; that somehow made its way back to Marlene).  The amount of material featured in this 261 page book is amazing!  Some of the highlights include: letters and cards received from John Gilbert (p.14), a favorite photo of hers that she called her &quot;American face&quot; because of the profile of her false eyelashes (p. 33), pictures of Marlene as a child (p.61), Marlene and daughter Maria playing (p.67), a telegram sent to Marlene from Maurice Chevalier written in French ending their affair (p.81), a photograph of Marlene and her husband (whom she never divorced) with daughter and husband's mistress cropped out where Marlene has handwritten &quot;My beloved husband&quot; (p.99), and, the final photo in the book, appropriately her farewell onstage gesture captured on film by the late Roddy McDowell from the wings.  These are just a few of many treasures found in this book.  I highly recommend it to any Marlene fan!	2002-01-04

There are also brief bios of all of the stars and an interview with Keith Thibodeaux AKA &quot;Little Ricky&quot; and some of the writers of the show.  My only complaint about the book are tributes from so called &quot;celebrities&quot; of the day...the celebrities chosen are for the most part minor who in a few years will not be remembered..there are only a few of these pages, but I think the book would have been better off without them.	2001-12-27

Suzanne Finstad interviewed nearly four hundred people in her research for this book and offers some startling revelations in her portrait of Natalie's life.  Finstad does an excellent job of drawing a very clear distinction between the person, Natasha, and the creation &quot;Natalie Wood&quot; and the demons these dueling personalities created within her life. The best thing about this biography is the unwavering (and well deserved) respect Finstad has for her subject.  Especially touching is Finstad's dedication of the book to Natasha &quot;the little girl lost in 'Natalie Wood'&quot; and her two sisters, Lana and Olga, as well as the parallel Finstad uses with Chekov's &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. From the beginning of &quot;Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood&quot; where Finstad traces Natasha's geneological roots in depth, to the end of the book where Finstad examines the possible events that led to the tragic loss of this great star at such a young age, Suzanne Finstad provides the reader with the spell-binding tale of Natasha and the people and events that shaped her life.  This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Natalie Wood and/or her films.	2001-06-13

There are several pictures of Jackie O throughout, but it is Lee's book and Lee herself and her friends are the primary focus.  All of the pictures and text are interesting, but the best part of the book is the last section where Jackie and Lee's &quot;One Special Summer&quot; is published...this was the &quot;book&quot; they wrote and illustrated after a summer vacation.	2001-05-22

Jackie Style is a beautiful part pictorial/part biography of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis.  There are tons of both black and white and colored photographs along with plenty of text about Jackie's life and her tastes.  My favorite section is called &quot;The Look&quot; where Pamela Keogh Clarke gives tips from Prescriptives makeup artist DARAC on how to achieve some of Jackie's looks (I work as a makeup artist, so this is especially interesting to me).  This is a beautiful, wonderful book...definitely a must have for anyone who loves Jackie O or any woman of style...also, if you have not read AudreyStyle, also by Pamela Keogh Clarke, you should pick it up as well...both are FABULOUS!!!	2001-04-26

Mary Pacios gives a personal account of her relationship with &quot;Bette&quot;, her research into Bette's death and  her 12 year search for answers.  Brings to light things I have never read  in any other book.  Pacios presents her own suspect in the case.  At first  her suspect may sound far fetched, but by the end of the book, the suspect  is really only one of two viable suspects that I have seen in the case.  READ THIS BOOK! Also recommended, &quot;Severed&quot; by John Gilmore.	2000-04-20

It is the most objective book available on Natalie so far.

Gene Tierney tells her story and comes acrossas a brave and intelligent woman.  She speaks candidly about hermental illness, her marriages, her family.  Poor Gene...her first daughter was born retarded and had to be institutionalized.  Her first marriage fell apart and she lost her grip on her sanity, but she bounced back.  She married Howard Lee and her second child (by first husband Oleg Cassini) was born healthy.  Today Gene might not be a household name, but she should be...if you read this book you will see why.

When I found a copy of this book, I bought it and read it in a matter of a few days.  Jennifer Jones was a much more fascinating person  than I had anticipated.  Although I found the book to be a little murky on  presenting a time/context of which events occur (particularly in relation  to her first husband, Robert Walker), the book is overall very interesting  and gives the reader an enthralling portrait of this great actress.	2000-01-24

It made me really angry!	I read this book after just finishing &quot;Severed&quot; by John Gilmore...and what a letdown!  &quot;Severed&quot; left me wanting to learn  more about &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; and this book just made me sick.  First off, I do not know what to think of Janice's assertions about  repressed memory.  I am in a psychology course in college right now and the  professor says that &quot;repression&quot; has never been proven.  But I  believe Knowlton had to endure some kind of abuse to come up with this  stuff, because it is VERY disgusting (I MEAN GRAPHICALLY DISGUSTING).  The  book makes me angry in so many ways.  First off there is this insinuation  that Elizabeth Short got what she deserved.  Knowlton accuses her of  physical and sexual abuse.  Also the book assumes the readers are  ignorant...for example every time something can not be backed up factually  (and that is most of the time) it is blamed on a cover up, lost documents,  lies of friends/families, and &quot;gaps&quot; in the recovery of Jan's  memories.  But the thing that really got me annoyed is that the book is  written in this horribly sick, sarcastic tone...for example, an anacronym  for Jan's sexual abuse was once referred to as &quot;daddy's love&quot;.  The whole book is written in terms like that and it made me sick.  I am not  a very cynical person and I usually can give someone the benefit of the  doubt, but this was too much.  You have to wonder if this was such a  painful real thing for Janice Knowlton to experience, why she had her story  written for the world to see?  If any of this stuff  had come from my mind,  repressed or not, I would run and hide!!!!	1999-10-29

I read this book in just a few days because it is so completely enthralling that you can not put it down!  I love the fact that this book told about Elizabeth Short's life and allowed the reader to see her as a  person and not just as the victim of this SICK and SENSELESS crime.  In  other reviews on Amazon, people have been criticizing the inaccuracy of  some details in this book, but if you read it, you see that everything  Gilmore writes makes sense, especially the conclusion he comes to about who  the actual murderer was.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.	1999-09-14

I picked it up to do a high school project about six years ago and I still sit down and flip through it once a week.  This book has kept me interested in classic movie stars and their lives.  Jean  Howard was an actress and was married to Charles K. Feldman, a producer.   However, she eventually became a photographer and was able, because of her  insider status, to get really great photos.  There are pictures of EVERYONE  from Norma Shearer (in her 50s) to Natalie Wood (in her 20s).  My favorite  pics are the ones of Linda Christian being fitted for her wedding gown to  marry Tyron Power, Marilyn Monroe, Vivien Leigh and Sir Laurence Olivier,  and many, many more.  This book is wonderful...I can not recommend it  highly enough!	1999-05-20

The book is intersting reading, also, but  nothing compares to those photos.	1999-05-20

However, as this book demonstrates, his career did not begin and end with Dobie.  He was an extremely reluctant  child actor, a determined college student, a supporting player on &quot;The  Bob Cummings Show&quot;, Dobie, a Las Vegas entertainment coordinator for a  hotel, a successful dinner theatre actor, a CBS executive, and a  writer/director.  No matter what other roles he played on screen or off he  can not escape being Dobie.  Having been around the industry virtually his  entire life, Hickman tells stories about  some of Hollywood's stars as well  as personal antecdotes that make the book hilarious.  Now happily married  for the third time with a young son ( he has a grown son from marriage #1),  Hickman has finally made peace with the fact that he will be &quot;Forever  Dobie&quot;.  The book is fun to read, intersting, and will make you laugh  out loud!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1999-02-08

Lana was 8 years younger than Natalie and always sought to be just like her and, when she failed, she had  to come to terms with who she really was.  Lana's relationship with Natalie  was at times strained, but Lana makes it obvious that Natalie was the  person, aside from her daughter, that she loved the most in this world.  It  is really moving to read the story of these two extraordinary women and  their relationship.  Lana did a great job!	1998-11-25

But, to Lana Wood, she was her sister and her best friend.  This extremely touching biography of Natalie ,by Lana,  examines Natalie's life through the eyes of someone who spent most of her  life trying to be like her.  The reader is no longer looking at Natalie the  movie star, but at Natalie the sister, the friend, the wife, and the  mother.  It is easy to feel the pain and utter devestation that Lana felt  when she lost her sister and understand her frustration at the estranged  realtionship she, at the time this book was written, had with her  brother-in-law, Robert Wagner, and her two nieces.  Overall, this story is  the story of two sisters, a happy, fruitful life, and a devestating  tragedy.  The book was written in 1984 and the information on family is a  little outdated (their mom died in early 1998 and Natalie's oldest  daughters are now  a successful actress and a successful artist), but the  emotions conveyed transcend time.	1998-11-19

To the best of my knowledge, this is the most recent biography of Vivien  Leigh, famed star of Gone With The Wind.  It is probably the most  comprehensive, as well, and is much kinder to her memory than any of the  other biographies I have read.  Walker makes a point of showing that Vivien  had a mental illness and was not &quot;insane&quot; and, probably due to  the fact that it was written so recently, it examines the lasting effects  of Vivien's marriage to Olivier and includes various quotes from his  autobiography.  This book made me appreciate Viven Leigh's talent more than  her beauty and realize what a profound impact she had on the theatre and  motion picture industry.  Vivien Leigh was more than just Scarlett O'Hara,  she was a brave, fascinating, and extremely talented (I believe the most  talented actress ever) woman.  Definitely worth reading!!!	1998-10-11

Can you imagine being a successful, albeit opinionated, person who,  through an unfortunate set of circumstances and the resentment of others,  is forced into a living hell?  Frances Farmer was not insane, she was  merely  a victim and ultimately a survivor who was shoved into a mental  institution for over seven years.  The description of her first day at the  institution is horrific and the fact that she endured such treatment for so  long makes her admirable.  This book tells of her unbelievable and  unimaginable experiences.  After completing this book I understand the  horrors that can occur in this world and can not accept that there are  individuals out there who inflict the kind of torment on people such as  Frances.  The theme of this book is survival and I have gained tremendous  respect for Frances Farmer.  She truly is a  survivor.	1998-08-17
