US	52993057	RJLB5H9HIS2PD	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	1	17	28	N	N	Wow...This Book Stinks!	This book was written by a journalist and is just further proof that journalists, much less economic journalists, SHOULD NOT WRITE BOOKS!  <br />The whole thing reads like something from a business journal.  Nash is rarely presented as a person, but rather as someone we only glimpse through the recollections of others.  Economic and mathematical theories and their importance are either presented as obvious (most of the time) or given such short explanations that they are worthless.  An example is:<br />&quot;Algebraic varieties are, like manifolds, also geometric objects, but they are objects defined by a locus of points described by one of the more algebraic equations.  Thus x2+y2=1 represents a circle in the plane, while xy=1 represents a hyperbola.  Nash's theorem states the following: Given any smooth compact k-dimensional manifold (M), there exists a real algebraic variety (V) in R2k+1 and a connected component (W) of (V) so that (W) is a smooth manifold diffeomorphic to (M).  In plain English, Nash is asserting that for any manifold it is possible to find an algebraic variety one of whose parts corresponds in some essential way to the original object.  To do this, he goes on to say, one has to go to higher dimensions.&quot;<br />Yes of course!  Why any Joe off the street should be able to recognize the genius in that!  Give that man Nobel Prize post haste, even before going to higher dimensions!<br />The author has thrown everything in this book that she possibly could.  Everyone that has even the faintest of contact with Nash is given several paragraphs and their own histories are presented back to birth.  Chapters deal with Princeton before Nash even attended and also with Nash dodging the draft during Korea.  All this is rigorously researched and references are given so it all must be true.  The real problem is that the truth in this case is presented in an exceptionally boring way.<br />If the book were about half the length and had an author that was ableto EXPLAIN instead of RECITE why Nash is important, it might be worth reading.  If you have a firm grounding in higher math or economic theory, you may find something useful in this book.  Everyone else should avoid this wandering, emotionless piece of trash.	2003-09-15

It's easy to get caught up in Zubrin's excitement as he describes a way to send humans to Mars within 10 years, leapfrogging NASA projects and cutting NASA cost estimates by 90%.  But then you start seeing the holes in his Mars Direct plan.  The launch vehicle we would need (the Saturn V) hasn't existed for 30 years.  Restarting production would be difficult and expensive.  Alternatives are little more than conceptual art.  If we were to get the first stage to Mars, it would have to land on its own (something we haven't had much luck with lately) and then set up an atmospheric distillery that would operate perfectly for months without any maintenance.  While Zubrin has proven the distillery is technically possible, his model looks like something you would see at a high school science fair.  If we get this far, we would send 4 astronauts on a 6-month journey in a tin can with space limitations so severe the inhabitants will envy maximum-security inmates.  If the astronauts are able to land successfully, they have a 6-month stay ahead of them followed by a 6-month return journey.  Zubrin doesn't want any doctors on the trip so these people will need to be perfectly healthy for 18 months in some of the most severe environments mankind has ever tested.<br />But why go to Mars?  Zubrin tries to tie going to Mars to man's need for exploration and future economic benefit.  It's an intriguing argument, but it fails.  The only real reason to go to Mars now is to determine if there is or has been life there.  Actually, finding no life will make the most people happy.  If no life is found in a particular spot, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist somewhere on the planet and another mission is justified.  Not finding life also allows religions to still claim that life only exists on Earth.  Actually finding past or present life would throw humanity into a quandary it probably isn't ready for.  <br />Latter chapters of the book deal with setting up colonies and terraforming the planet.  Surprisingly, Zubrin doesn't address native life on Mars at all.  If life is found, do we have the right to set up colonies or take steps that may wipe out Martian life only for our own good?  Did we not learn anything from the American west and Native Americans?  While it may not be Zubrin's place as a scientist to worry about such problems, if he can speculate on selling Martian land without anyone being on the planet he certainly has the responsibility to address issues related to actual Martians.<br />When we do decide to go to Mars, let's make sure it's for the right reasons.  Those reasons are lacking in this book.	2003-08-13

Without the Antarctica setting, the book would just be an economic, political, social, and environmental debate.  The rather unique setting is able to take these different areas and show them from many perspectives.  The book also has a mystery that keeps you interested until it is fully revealed in the last 1/3 of the book.<br />The history of Antarctica is recounted mostly through conversations of lesser characters.  The main characters are believable and their backgrounds are explained in some detail.  The actual &quot;science fiction&quot; parts of the story are always kept in the background, and while sometimes interesting, are rarely absolutely necessary.<br />I didn't like the last 1/3 of the book.  This was mostly because it wasn't in fitting with the rest of the book.  Two groups that were previously only hinted at are brought in and add little to the story other than to bring the mystery to a close.<br />The ending leaves a lot to be resolved, and I'm not sure there won't be a sequel.	2003-08-03

I was surprised to find it a clever and very well thought out page-turner.  The first 100 or so pages are a little slow, but after that it is hard to put the book down.  Unlike some books (I'm looking your way Eco), this book doesn't have to pretend about how smart it is.  Is everything in the book true?  Of course not, but the book does suggest a dozen or more areas which readers can divert to if interested.  I think the greatest power a book has is to inspire more reading, and this book does that perfectly.	2003-06-21

Pages 217-236 are about the actual war and are fairly well written.  The rest of the book is written in the style of an angst-filled girl in her early teens.  I frequently found myself rolling my eyes at the way the author would describe a particular situation.<br />The book is also horribly overwritten.  Chapters are devoted to relationships that have no bearing on the overall story.  The book has a schizophrenic feel with chapters jumping between the past, present, and future.  This shouldn't be surprising as the author seems to suffer from a dozen psychological problems.<br />The only reason I read the book to the end was so that I could write a review here and warn others that the reviews you heard on CSPAN and NPR were horribly wrong.	2003-05-12

Even if you don't live in Illinois or plan to visit, the offbeat humor in this book makes it well worth reading.  More than half the book is given over to Chicago and the burbs.  For the location of many sites mentioned in the book, you'll see the original structures have been torn down.  So while you may go to where the 1st skyscraper was constructed, you won't see it today.<br />The areas outside of Chicago are covered in much less detail.  The author has included 3 maps covering northern, central, and southern Illinois to help with locating these more out of the way attractions.<br />The book has a somewhat disturbing bent towards scenes of violence and death.  Cemeteries are covered in detail as are sites of various tragedies.	2002-10-20

After some predictable digs at the Florida election and Bush in general, this book loses all focus and humor.  Moore seems like someone that has just discovered the internet and includes a lot of URLs for almost everything (including step ladders and vibrators.)

This is Michael Moore's take on America circa 1996.  A lot has happened since the publication and this book often has an unintended humor.  Most of the essays are just a few pages and this is a good thing since Moore can't seem to keep a train of thought going for much longer.  In 1 chapter he'll be pushing for more immigration while in the next complaining about the number of Germans in Florida.  If you've seen Moore's TV shows or movies, most of the targets will be familiar and you shouldn't be disappointed.  But if you were looking for a consistent message or a call to arms, you'd be better off looking someplace else.	2002-09-20

This book documents the discovery, recovery, and preservation of the steamship Arabia and its cargo.  The Arabia sank in 1856 near Kansas City, and most of the events covered in this book pertain to the late 1980s recovery.  The book is well illustrated with photos of the recovery and artifacts.  However the text is very simple and often goes on tangents of drilling water wells or cleaning sand out of clothes.  I would have preferred a professional's perspective on the importance of the find instead of just the author's story.  The book is over 200 pages, but I read it in less than a day.  Overall, this book seems like an extended brochure for the museum.	2002-08-29

The story by David Roberts is that of Mallory the person...his life, times, and accomplishments.  Sure Irvine is presented here, but it is always as a supporting and replaceable character.  Roberts does an excellent job of showing the 3 Everest expeditions that Mallory undertook and how each was monumental in its own way.<br />Conrad Anker's story of the discovery of Mallory's body is appalling.  You soon realize that these people had no idea what they were going to do if they did find Mallory or Irvine's body.  When they found Mallory's body (they were looking for Irvine's) they immediately took to removing anything of even the remotest value they could from the corpse.  I can understand taking some tissue samples and a few personal items (perhaps the letters and scarf), but why a knife?  Why beef lozenges or a safety pin or pieces of twine?  There were very few items that could show if the duo summited or lend a clue as to when they died (camera, altimeter, watch), so why steal the other items to put on display in a museum in Washington state?  At least they had the decency to cover up the corpse.  But they came back a few days later, unearthed the corpse, used a metal detector to find more items, then pried Mallory's face out of the ground for no reason other than that they could.  Then Anker has the gall to complain endlessly about who had the rights to broadcast news of the discovery.  If Irvine's body is ever found, we can only hope it will be treated with more respect than what these grave robbers showed to Mallory.<br />Anker goes on to talk of his summit attempt and other expeditions on the mountain.  This is typical Everest fare with people doing stupid things and needing rescued.  Conrad makes the summit and since he wasn't able to free climb the 2nd step assumes that Mallory couldn't either.<br />If there's anything to learn from this book, it's to fall all the way off the mountain or into a deep crevasse.  Anything less risks being found by buffoons and picked clean.	2002-03-15

Hancock's basic premise is that an ancient civilization built monuments around the world that are astronomically aligned to the year 10,500BC (thus backdating human history several thousand years.)  And somehow these monuments are linked to the search for immortality.<br />Hancock and his wife travel around the world and try to tie a lot of historical sites together with magic numbers (72 being the most prevalent but any even number being almost as good.)  The problem I had was that the linking of the monuments to stars degrades as the book moves along.  The link is clear in Egypt, possibly present in Mexico, requires squinting in Cambodia, and then devolves to a lot of &quot;as ifs&quot; and &quot;rough alignments&quot;.<br />The pictures in the book are pretty even if they don't always offer the clearest view of the idea the book is trying to convey.  Most of the diagrams involving star alignments are oversimplified and practically useless.<br />This book barely advances the ideas put forth in &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;.  It mainly takes the format of &quot;Message of the Sphinx&quot; and applies it to other mysterious places around the earth.	2002-02-14

This book has a broad reach of topics all loosely centered on ancient contact with extraterrestrial beings.  While there are many examples, there are few that have any detail.  This can leave you hanging as you read about astronomical computers in the time of Christ or a metal monument in India that doesn't show signs of aging.<br />The author also shows a nearly breathless anticipation of the future in flatly stating that manned craft will reach Mars no later than 1986 and in predicting bases on the moon.  And then he gets really crazy by stating that it's not really a big problem to predict the economy of a country the size of Mexico for the next 50 years.<br />This book provides a good introduction to many unexplained mysteries...just don't look to it for answers.	2002-02-03

There is little middle ground here.  This is easy in the beginning because a lot of space is devoted to showing the similarities in Sumerian, Greek, and Akkadian pantheons.  However, the book quickly moves into alternate interpretations of ancient texts that indicate the gods were really from a &quot;12th planet&quot; that orbits the sun every 3600 earth years.  Oh, and these gods created mankind to work in African mines for gold (after the gods got tired of doing it themselves.)<br />I'm not sure you can be critical of this book without going back to the source documents because Stichin freely admits that his interpretations are not always what other scholars believe.  As fiction, the book stands on its own.  As a serious work, it lacks in scientific proof.  Take it as you see fit.	2002-01-24

Clancy seems to have taken it to heart in producing this 1100+ page work.  There is a decent story here, but it is buried in hundreds of pages of political, economic, and social commentary that tends to be to the right of Rush Limbaugh.<br />There are at least 5 stories in the book...all of which are strung together with only the weakest of links.  The same jokes are repeated endlessly, and while they are funny the 1st time, you tire of them after the 3rd.  The familiar cast of Clancy characters is trotted out, some just to make cameo appearances.  All these different people might as well be the same as they mostly share the same views and beliefs.<br />There is decent suspense and the mechanical magic we've come to expect from \\"technothrillers\\", but only the most diligent reader will reach the payoff.  Whatever gift Clancy had earlier in his career seems to have left with \\"Clear And Present Danger\\".	2002-01-08

Blind, severely frostbit, and left to die (twice), Weathers stood up and basically walked down the mountain to a high altitude helicopter evacuation.<br />This Everest story involves about a quarter of the book.  It quickly becomes apparent that Weathers' greatest accomplishment in life was to almost die.<br />The rest of the book is about Beck and his parents, his brother, his wife, his kids, his pets, his depression, his faith, and his job...and it's pretty boring.  In the end, we find that Weathers neglected his family for so long, they basically gave up on him...not caring whether he was around or not.  But of course Beck is given a second chance to make everything better and now he wanders around his house telling his kids, wife, and pets how much he really loves them (at least that's the impression I got).<br />What I found most interesting is that Weathers at no point absolutely swears off mountain climbing (despite having lost a good part of his face and most of his hands to frostbite, not to mention the strain it put on his family).  <br />Will Beck climb again?  Will Peach divorce him and take the kids?  What will happen to the family dog?  I'm sure there will be a sequel and I'll tentatively call it &quot;Back To Life&quot; and give it 1 star.  The gravy train on Everest books is coming to an end.	2001-12-26

The strength of the series remains in the character development and global scope.  There is also the occasional surprise to see how this alternate history differs from real history.<br />However, it soon becomes apparent that the characters are having the same conversations every time they meet...and those conversations are almost exactly like what they discussed in the previous book.  The plot moves slowly and the overall story line is really only advanced in the last 150 pages.  While I remain interested in seeing how this series turns out, I don't feel like reading the same thing in every book.  Here's hoping Turtledove straightens things out in book 3.	2001-10-27

If you saw this guy on Discovery or The History Channel, you probably won't find much of interest in this book.  The amount of space devoted to the Sphinx and Yonaguni Monument is almost an afterthought.  And sadly, this is the only original work in the entire book.<br />Most of this book deals with uniformitarianism (gradual change) and catastrophism (rapid change) in geology, evolution, and human history.  The author's main credibility in presenting this evidence is that he is a dispassionate scientist that went to Yale and you are not.  In creating a dispassionate work, Schoch has only managed to write a book that is very boring.<br />Nearly half the book is simply looking at various theories to explain impacts with space rocks.  So we're treated to rocks of varying densities and speed impacting at various angles sometimes on land and sometimes on water and sometimes both.  These rocks are used to explain everything from the Ice Age to Polynesian emigration to Genghis Khan leaving Mongolia to conquer the world.<br />In the end, there is still little science here and a lot of conjecture.  Schoch clings ferociously to some &quot;facts&quot; and theories while tossing others aside because they weren't advanced by the right discipline.  In the end, I realize that Carl Sagan did all this earlier and much better.	2001-10-16

Here it is folks: the life of Timothy McVeigh stripped and layed bare for all to see.  The authors say they wrote this book because they wanted to be sure that McVeigh had a chance to talk (unlike Oswald after the Kennedy assassination) and to try to provide some closure.<br />The authors have done a good job of researching McVeigh back to before he was born.  Since the authors really have no idea why McVeigh did the bombing, they have thrown everything in here: medical records, recollections of friends and family, employement history, and on and on.  In the end this only establishes that McVeigh was somewhat normal and pretty boring.<br />The book does a good job of showing how the bombing was accomplished.  The movements and actions of McVeigh and others are tracked nationwide.  The series of events leading up to the bombing is explained in great detail.  All the physical pieces of the puzzle come together in a very tidy package.<br />The book leads us to believe that if you subject anyone to some anti-government propoganda, a few guns, a disillusioned military experience, and events like Waco that you will get someone capable of mass murder.  The question is no longer why, but instead why not.<br />There is nothing that can answer why.  Don't look for it in this book.	2001-08-17

This book begins with the interesting premise of a man digging a hole in his backyard to escape from nuclear war.  However, the story quickly disintegrates into 4 decades filled with cardboard characters, implausible situations, and worst of all...mind numbing boredom.<br />The story is told in chapters alternating between the present (1995) and the past going back to the narrator's childhood.  The narrator grows up during the height of the cold war, dodges the draft, and joins the anti-war movement.  While this should be an exciting time, it instead feels like a drug induced sleep.  I never got the impression that any of the characters really cared about anything other than themselves.<br />Somehow the main character winds up rich with all his dreams fulfilled.  Except that his daughter is a whiny brat (I honestly can't stand writers that use italics in every sentence.)  So we are left with an anti-climatic ending that resolves absolutely nothing.<br />This book isn't scary, funny, or insightful.  It wanders aimlessly before dying without a whimper.	2001-08-15

This is a super little book that has a lot of practical information on backpacking and hiking.  There are sections on nearly every type of gear, food, shelters, wildlife, hiking strategy, and trail courtesy.  Most of the information is not specific to the AT, and you probably won't find much use for the book once you're out on the trail.  The book has thorough appendix that list gear, other sources of information, and AT organizations.

It is well written and should be easily understandable even to someone that doesn't care at all about riding a bike. Probably the only criticism I have for this book (and this is true about most autobiographies) is that Lance seems to take particular joy in striking back at everyone he feels has wronged him in his life. So we are treated to stories of incompetent father figures, sponsors that gave him up for dead, and even revenge at high school classmates that dressed differently. <br />Overall it's an incredible story and well worth reading. Despite the title of the book, I found that most of the story did revolve around Armstrong's cycling career (after all, who would read this book if Lance had survived cancer but given up cycling). It is an inspiring story that anyone can relate to, no matter what the hills are in your life.	2001-08-08

It isn't a technical guide to the trail or hiking in general.  Much of the book doesn't even deal with hiking at all.  The book is funny, full of insight, has tragedy and triumph, and in the end is well worth reading.  The author seems to have problems with everyone along the trail that doesn't share his goal or opinions (most notably the Park and Forestry services).  Luckily the author cuts many of his criticisms on the loss of nature short and quickly moves on to a more upbeat topic.<br />I've read this book twice and would recommend it to anyone that has ever seen a trailhead and felt a pull beyond words to see what was beyond the next hill.	2001-08-08

If you decide to read this book, do yourself a favor and skip everything but the last chapter.  The book up to the end is a high level overview and includes chapters on the committee approach to target selection, administrative details on persecuting war criminals, and my favorite - the emails of 2 British writers debating their respective positions.<br />The book brings up occasionally interesting notions such as the international community's right to get involved in a sovereign state's affairs and the double standards that arise when we do choose to get involved (ie why Kosovo but not Rwanda).<br />But overall the author doesn't seem to have a coherent message other than to say that &quot;the Kosovo conflict was different than past military operations and future operations will likely be different from Kosovo.&quot;  Even though the author defines Kosovo as a &quot;virtual war&quot;, he forgets that it only achieved success when &quot;real war&quot; elements were introduced (such as turning off the lights, dropping the bridges, and introducing ground troops).  If there were lessons to be learned from the Kosovo conflict, you won't find them in this book.	2001-05-21

This is a great book regardless of how outlandish some of the stories it contains are.  The author's greatest strength is not in forming unique opinions about the subject but rather in bringing together a vast number of sources to show an America completely different than what we've been lead to believe.<br />The book just isn't about lost cities but also generally weird stuff throughout Central and North America.  There is evidence of Asian contact with Central American cultures, pterodactyls in Arizona, Vikings in Oklahoma, Irish monks running all over the place, and those are the more believable stories.  Atlantis or a gold city always seems to be around the corner, Jesus may have visited the New World, a master race is controlling the world from underground, the Egyptians had a colony in the Grand Canyon, and of course the government is covering all this up.<br />The book does have its problems.  The editing is horrible.  The narrative that strings the author's travels together is wooden and painful to read.  Each chapter stands by itself, but this means that some background material is repeated, often word for word.  Overall these are minor issues.<br />The book doesn't provide any answers but it does make a choice perfectly clear.  You can either accept the traditional view that people wandered across a land bridge in Siberia to colonize the Americas and stayed relatively isolated and unadvanced until Europeans showed up in 1492 and wiped them out.  Or you can read this book and see if there is evidence out there that suggests otherwise.	2001-05-14

In America today, there are 3 accepted ways of dealing with personal anguish: religion, psychology, and beer.  \\"How Good Do We Have To Be?\\" combines a great deal of Old Testament religion (not surprising since the author is a rabbi), quite a few Freudian theories, and leaves the amount of beer to use up to the reader.<br />The \\"radically new interpretation\\" of the story of Eden is nothing new.  It has always been a central understanding of my religious background that we are human (and able to experience the joys and pains of being human) only because of what happened in Eden.  How Kushner is able to suddenly stumble on this is beyond me (of course I don't have much experience with the Jewish faith).<br />Overall the book is well written and easily understandable.  Chapters deal with forgiving family members, life partners, and ourselves.  These chapters are backed up with personal stories (which are probably the book's strongest point).<br />So how good do we have to be?  The answer is \\"pretty good\\" if you want to have a job, friends, and good family relations.  This book offers no excuses for personal behavior (and repeatedly points out that we must be responsible for our actions).  If you come from a guilt producing religion or are carrying a large amount of guilt for any reason, you may find the message in this book useful.	2001-05-09

Each chapter is filled with unforgettable characters.  The main character (Dean) is undoubtedly 1 of the best characters in American literature.  Think of Kramer from Seinfeld on speed and you're halfway to understanding Dean.  Dean is part con man, part philosopher, part W.C. Fields, and part Don Juan.  Dean takes over every situation not by saying or doing anything but just by being there.  There are innumerable road trips blasting across the Nebraska plain, across California mountain passes, and through the Mexican jungle.  Under the surface there are some pretty serious things going on (drug and alcohol abuse, theft, casual sex, and irresponsible parenting), but most of this is brushed aside as these aren't really adults we're dealing with.  These are aimless kids out for (relatively) harmless kicks in post-WWII America.  I hope you dig this book as much as I did.	2001-05-02

But once I realized that there wasn't a good side, or a bad side, or any explanation as to why this was going on, or how we got involved, or why we're still involved the book started to make sense.  At least as much sense as a foreign civil war can.  The author takes us from arriving in Sarajevo through final cease-fire with a brief (but very violent) diversion into Chechnya.  Loyd spends much of his time with common people and soldiers, and is through their eyes that we see most of the war.  Despite the number of deaths, mutilations, and general horrors you can be assured that a story even more disgusting and appalling is only a few pages away.  This books greatest strength is that it never loses its raw edge.	2001-04-27
US	52993057	R34ZCBEWNQU8DS	0060174900	802369838	The Bell Jar: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Nice little read.	This is a great book.  It neatly shows how those with psychiatric problems may look normal on the outside but inside they are rotting (and I think I am entitled to use the word rotting).  Plath's work clearly demonstrates how even the most promising are in reality just a few steps away from personal hells.  The descriptions of electro-convulsive therapy are terrifying (although the process has suppousedly been made less barbaric today).  It would be interesting to read this book if it had been written today when psychotropic drugs are somewhat more effective.	2001-04-23
US	52993057	R3C3ZX7F6RQBNP	1563319365	607474150	Ultimate High: My Everest Odyssey	Books	3	9	13	N	N	Nothing new.	This book is affected by a malady that seems to infect all mountaineering books in that it references countless other climbs and climbers (half of which have met a tragic end).  I suppose this does set some context, but the endless name dropping gets tiresome.<br />Kropp's retelling of his bicycle journey from Sweden to Everest is forgettable.  7,000 miles is compressed into 1 chapter where the author has some rocks thrown at him, has his bike fixed a couple times, and is occasionally scared.  That's about all the information we get about the bike trip.  I've read more thrilling accounts of a chicken crossing the road.<br />When the author does get to Everest we're presented with the now familiar characters that we've all come to know and love.  Hall is still the charmer, Fischer the thinker, and Pittman always the villain.  Kropp is the 1st to make an attempt on the mountain in 1996, but is turned around at high altitude by a storm.  While he is recuperating at base camp, the tragic events of May 10th unfold.  This section seems lifted directly out of \\"Into Thin Air\\" (especially since the author had no direct role in the events).<br />After nearly everyone else leaves, Kropp makes another attempt at the summit (after all, he didn't ride his bike 7,000 miles for nothing) and this time is successful.  After a predictable near-death experience on the descent, Kropp is reunited with his girlfriend for a return bicycle trip to Sweden where I assume they live happily ever after.<br />Throughout the book Kropp takes great pains to point out that his expedition is entirely self-supported and that he isn't 1 of the \\"65,000 tourists\\" just looking to get Everest for his trophy case.  To this end we're treated with Kropp accounting for every bit of food (down to a cup of tea and candy bar) that he didn't carry to Everest.  But at the end of the book we're shown a chart listing the tallest mountains in the world and the ones that Kropp has climbed are checked off.  Trophy hunting indeed.<br />Kropp also informs us of his next adventure.  He plans to sail from Sweden to Antarctica and then trek to the South Pole.  All self-supported of course.  The only hitch in his plan is that he doesn't know how to sail.  He plans to do this by 2004, and I think I'll be skipping that book.  \\"Ultimate High\\" deserves 2 stars.  I'm giving it 3 stars only because cycling some 14,000 miles is pretty dang impressive.	2001-04-18
US	52993057	R1KVWEUQNFUVPE	0375725784	381316770	A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Here is my review.	There are nearly 300 reviews for this book and mine won't be the best.  But I'm trying to get my numbers up, and I enjoyed this book so here it is.<br />This book moves at the speed of thought and is an incredibly fast read (manic being the apparent word of choice).  The story itself is rather plain (death, aging, parents, friends), but each aspect is looked at from many angles and the result is often a bizarre and unexpected humor.  The truly funny parts are laugh-out-loud funny.  The sad parts are diluted to the point that you really can't tell what is real.<br />A great book for the late-20somethings out there that can remember being lost and floundering.	2001-04-17

The book is densely written and goes in more directions than a spider's web.  The breadth of topics is impressive even though most of the depth is manufactured.  The last 150 pages I just wanted it to end...for there to be some resolution to the seemingly endless diversions on almost every subject.  Instead there is only something about truth or beauty or something else that really doesn't bring the book to a close.  But most of the book is entertaining.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.	2001-04-11
US	52993057	R1YN3I8D8YS23I	0312206372	8148905	The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Another perspective.	This book is great for what it is...the recollections of a professional mountain climber during the ascent and subsequent rescue of commercial expeditions on Everest in 1996. It's written in a matter-of-fact style that doesn't dally so much on the personal shortcomings of the participants. When the authors do bring criticism against individuals (almost always Krakauer or Pittman), it seems misplaced. The Adventure Consultants expedition is frequently referred to as &quot;Krakauer's&quot; even though he was only a client. And I think that only Krakauer is referred to as a &quot;climber-client&quot; and not merely as a &quot;client&quot; implying that he had some responsibility when things went bad. <br />Personally, I didn't think &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; was that critical of Boukreev. No one can question that Boukreev's actions saved the lives of 3 others that had no hope. Thankfully the book doesn't spend much time heaping accolades on Boukreev or on placing much blame. In the end, it was individual decisions that led to the tragedies...tragedies that could have been even worse. <br />The response from DeWalt to Krakauer is forgettable, but the transcription of the debriefing tapes gives even more views as to what went on. The quotes from Boukreev and Lopsang, while occasionally difficult to understand, provide the most insight.	2001-01-13

The book bases most of its conclusions on astronomical data and alternative interpretations of Egyptian texts.<br />Any reader should be forewarned that the book relies heavily on math. Even though the book is well illustrated, I found the presence of so much math and astronomical data to be overwhelming and not in the least bit interesting. Many of the Egyptian texts presented don't translate very well to English, and the authors often present 3 meanings for 1 word or phrase.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;, but this book doesn't really go far enough. At the end (and this gives a lot away), we find that the authors do believe the pyramids were completed around 2500bc (as conventional Egyptian history holds). There really isn't anything here that is revolutionary.	2000-07-11
