In that page he claimed not to have a better leader than George Bush in his 36 year professional service. He does not address any of the question as to why we do not have Osama or Mullah Omar and why his strategies were a total failure in Afganistan as well as in Iraq. He does not address the issue if the Iraq war undermined the war on terror by diverting scare rescources. He also does not address any issue how the mead east peace is going to be achived and how this military invasion is going to bring democracy in the region. <br /> <br />There are times when he criticized Richard Clark who authored the new book on Against all Enemy of not prividng with actionable intelligence to attach bin Laden. But alas can not provide how a policy maker will get intelligence when it is job of CIA.  <br /> <br />He seems to me an arrogant Texan just like Bush who has very skewed and polarized view of the world. <br />	2004-08-11
