After she passed away, I borrowed it and read it, and was thoroughly entertained. Very good storytelling, and very good ideas. I won't rave about it as others have here (come on people...), but it was a very forward-thinking book. WHY are people making movies like The Day After Tomorrow when a film of the HAB Theory is waiting to be made? I see that movie rights have been sold (see a letter from the author at [...]) but where is the movie?	2004-11-17
US	53049909	R2VEHANPA9AOEK	0618219064	150294181	The Wind Done Gone: A Novel	Books	4	8	18	N	N	This is not so different from what'd done in Japan	In Japan (where I live, long story) there is a thing called \\"doujinshi\\" which is a kind of underground comic book that fans and amateur artists create, parodying famous characters from anime, novels, you name it. They're sold at a big convention called the Comic Market in Tokyo twice a year. The books are a way for fans to show their devotion to the artwork and characters from the anime series the like, and explore with the characters (often with sexy results, and there are many sexual doujinshi and books that postulate male/male relationships between characters from Gundam, Pokemn, etc.). In Japan, the doujinshi are seen as parodies, and are not worried over by the copyright holders (except in the most extreme of circumstnaces), and in fact, the underground comic world of the doujinshi is one of the most creative you can find anywhere -- virtually all game, animation or manga companies draw their talent from the artists working in this field. That someone took this creative \\"doujinshi\\" type approach to explore a famous work from America does not surprise me, although I am disappointed at the ruckus it caused. Still, I believe that the corporate suits won't be able to stop this kind of thing from happening in the future. Go, creative people everywhere -- you are the greatest!	2004-01-25

Clarke said, &quot;The best book on the colonization of mark&quot; that has ever been.<br />That being said -- come on! There was a lot of crap in these books.  Elusive characters that each have one big, fat character trait (Maya is  angry and flighty, Frank is petty and scheming, blahblahblah, Jackie is  scheming). Little quips about Japanese, like throwing &quot;shigata ga  nai&quot; all the time (I live in Japan and speak Japanese, and cringe  whenever a write has his characters speaking Japanese &quot;because it's  the future&quot;). (Are you listening, Gentry Lee???). Way too much detail  about the terraforming bit of it, and for all tha it was not believable  (that gene therapy that allows people to live in high CO2 environments was  just SO convenient).<br />What this series does best, strangely, is paint a  reasonable, interesting picture of what Earth would be like in the future,  with multinat corporations and what not. Also, the best description of how  robot factories and space elevators might work -- that was interesing.<br />All in all, this work would have been far better as one 600 page book,  instead of three 500 page books.
