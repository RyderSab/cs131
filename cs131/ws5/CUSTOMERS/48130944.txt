Unlike some reviewers who thought this book insulted their intelligence, I think the plot is plausible- you have to accept the book on its own terms.  I totally believed that two souls can encounter one another and change each other- even in one weekend. I have known people for whom this has happened.  Granted, the novel is occassionally predictable, but it touched me.<br /><br />I especially liked that there is an emphasis on the idea of grief and having to go on for children.  Not orginal but the author really deals with it in a positive way. He is a good writer and one that I will try again.	2005-09-12

This was not up to her standards.  While I did like the change of scenery (this novel is set in idyliic Greece) I felt that the characters were not fleshed out.  I could not belive some of the romances (especially towards the end of the novcel) or the one-dimensional character of Shane, who is cast as a moronic villain.<br /><br />I think what was the most disappointing aspect was that certain characters (especially David) were left w/o any closure at all.<br /><br />This novel didn't ring true and wasn't especially well-written either.	2005-09-12

Frankly, Amy Tan is one of the best authors we have writing these days- literary and humane.  That is not to say I didn't enjoy this book.  There were a few laugh-out-loud scenes, including one that is over the top and even slightly gross.<br /><br />I didn't find this character that shallow.  She is actually quite realistic for a 25 year old who is 'finding' herself.  I also really liked the portrayal of the grandmother, my favorite character.  The scewnes in China are very moving.<br /><br />The book mainly deals with being 2nd generaton Chinese-American in a family with divided feelings about their 'Chineseness.'  It's a good topic but maybe the main problem with the book is that there is too much going on, not enough focus.  I also found the author's style off putting.  There are WAY too many desciptive words in a sentence. It makes for rather amateurish writing.<br /><br />But a fun, quick read.	2005-09-09

A pleasant surprise	Slater is a great storyteller with a knack for making his childhood familiar and capturing details. I love that he uses food to convey memory and place.  The book is great when discussing  his Mom (who can't cook), Dad (a man with a temper but who adores sweets) and his stepmom (the woman who can cook but is a bit evil).  I lost interest when he dove into adolescence but that is just a personal preference.  If you like food descriptions and coming-of-age stories this is sure to be your cup of tea	2005-08-25

Landis.  The author makes some interesting choices, such as writing in an impressionistic matter. However, I definitely feel that although the book is alive with detail of 19th century musical life, the book loses some appeal b/c it completely seems to characterize Clara as a victim of both her father and Robert.  Both men are presented as villians in most points of the book.  Even though you could argue that the book is balanced (b/c we are shown how life is like through Robert's eyes) there seems to clear agenda of showing how Clara was forced to give up her musical career, when in fact she did not completely give it up in real life.<br /><br />But that is just one flaw in the book that I found, whcih does not diminsh the book's strengths, especially its detailed portrait of an era and what it is like to be a musical genius. I actually preferred the portion of the book devoted to Clara's  childhood-Fascinating stuff!<br /><br />Wish the book has gone on to describw what Clara's life was like after Robert's death. But if you enjoy  music and love stories this is a good novel.	2005-08-19

Frankly, I hope that in his next memoir there iwll be more about his literary writing b/c this doesn't cover his marvelous literary career at all.<br /><br />The first sections of the book which deal with his childhood and schooling are comic and moving, with great turns of phrase and details about his grandfather and large family.  What I found less interesting were the accounts of his journalism career.  Apart from a very compelling section about a political asassination and its aftermath, I was a little bored. Even worse, I did not feel that some of his bohemian friends were distinguished from each other.<br /><br />I am going to go back and reread The General in His Labyrinth and the novels that I so adore.

Very dull	I have to start by saying that I like long, involving novels by great authors (e.g.  Tolstoi, Dickens, Hawthorne). I actually expected to love this book.  Instead, the best I have to say is that I liked parts of it.  The chapters focusing on Ahab are replete with drama and a gorgeous sense of tragedy-the stuff of Greek drama.  Then Ishamael, as narrator, takes over and discusses the minutiae of whaling and even whale physignomy.  I don't care. I simply was bored.  While I can understand on an intellectual basis the way this story is structured,I have to agree with those reviewers who said the book was a mess when it came out.<br /><br />I have read one other work of Melville's, namely Billy Budd. I hated that too. It could be that he just isn't my cup of tea.  Or maybe some of us just think Moby Dick is overrated.	2005-07-12

It's a sad novel in many ways and nothing is completely fleshed out, so that you are left feeling somewhat dreamy and haunted yourself.  My favorite character is not Aimee but rather Plumey, who I think is a great creation, very real. The parts of the book I enjoyed deal with motherhood in various forms.  My only complaint is that Amos isn't well developed.  But perhaps that was the author's intention.	2005-07-12

It seemed less like a novel than a real journal, where I could explore the life of a very interesting, astutue young girl on the cusp of first love.  Cassandra and her family are funny, sad and infinitely real.  I love the dialogue and also the descriptions of English country life.  The first scenes of being down-and-out in a huge castle are beautiful and comic.  But the novel moved me most in its moments where Cassandra finds herself desolate and heartbroken, asking God for comfort.  This is an exquisite, gentle book.  I will pick it up again soon.	2005-05-07

This is the kind of book that makes you feel you have lived with each of the characters, from Huw and Davey to the preacher Mr.Gryffyd (who I especially felt was captured perfectly).  The tone of the book is nostalgic but it never sentimentalizes the harshness of coal mining or the other stuggles but rather puts the joy of family and community in sharp contrast to business tactics that destroy that very village life.  I felt genuinely sad ending this novel.  VEry, very good.	2005-04-26

Tomalin is an excellent writer: straightforward, witty, and articulate about my favorite author's life. Loving Austen novels, I also have to add that I have been hesitant to ever read a biography, but now I am grateful that I understand Austen's world and her extremely interesting family.  The stories draw you in and keep you reading long into the night, transporting you to England in the 1770's and beyond.  Reading this is a little like reading Austen and that is the highest compliment I can pay an author.	2005-04-18

I really liked the characters and the charming Southern locale. Dorothea is an interesting detective, in that she is a tea shop owner in a tightknit community.  Childs writes very well about the relationships of her characters and her dialogue has the ring of real conversation.  The only flaw (and this is a major one given that it is a mystery) is that the mystery was WAY too easy to solve.  I won't give it away but I will say I was not impressed.  Yet, b/c everything else worked so well, I will invest in another book in the series because the book made me cozy and comfy while sipping on my very own cup of tea.	2005-04-07

The author's tone is one of benevolent teacher, mainly for the novice.  I would say that I am a  novice meditator.  I pray regularly but have always ound meditation a bit more difficult so I appreciate Finley's advice about breathing and sitting.  His personal stories and the quotes he picks are excellent, one feels that that the saints and holy people he quotes are  better, more concise sources of information.<br /><br />My main complaint is that Finley is extremely repetitive, to the point of redunduncy; there are only so mnay ways to make a point and he makes them over and over again.<br /><br />If the rest of the book had been like chapter 7 (entering the mind of Christ) I would have been a happier reader.  This chapter is far more theological but also more mystical.  I suppose that this is what I was looking for in a guide.	2005-04-06

This one took much patience on my behalf. I don't feel that the story has any true purpose or direction until chapter 15.  This novel is about many things, perhaps too many:  love, marriage, debt, character, the common good, a changing society.  The three main stories which articulate the author's ideas are of varying degrees of interest and some characters are 'built' in better ways than others. My particular favorites are the Garths, Lydgate and Mr. Farebrother.  The main character, Dorothea, is interesting but a bit too perfect-she's compared to the Virgn Mary, so that may give  you an idea of how morally superior she is.  The character of Fred Vincy annoyed me so much that I felt the many pages devoted to him were almost wasteful.<br /><br />The novel has wonderful aspects, the best being an attention to the moral and intellectual concerns of everyday people. The pages where Lydgate's innner turmoil about his debt are desrcibed showhow little things change.<br /><br /> What is frustrating to me about this book is the intrusive voice of the narrator; I dislike being told things in a novel that should be shown instead.  Plus, there is a long-winded style to Eliot's writing  that I did not find in two of her books that I truly loved: The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner.<br /><br />This book will appeal to you most if you want to read about marriage and the tolls it can take on men and women, especially men and women who think. The scenes between Lydgate and Dorothea are fantastic and chapter 81 between Rosamund and Dorothea is a rare thing in fiction: an honest scene between women.	2005-04-01

A good early effort	The important thing is to know that this is earlier Dickens- thus, not as good as some of the masterpieces that came later.  I enjoyed this at times and found the comedy exceptional.  However, sometimes the novel veers into outright sentimentality.  The hero and Kate are overly perfect.  I am not saying anything other critcs of Dickens haven't already said.  What makes this book supremely fun is the assemblage of characters and the ridiculous situations.  Mrs. Nickleby made me laugh  out loud.  Read it and see the beginnings of Dickensian greatness.	2005-03-27

This was a book recommended to me by someone who knows her stuff.  Gully Foyle starts off as an empty shell of a human being, bent only on destruction (for somewhat valid reasons).  What Bester does is show the evolution of a human being, and he throws in some astonishing moments that can be seen as metaphors for God and creation.  The last section makes you feel like you are inside a psychedelic poem.	2005-03-27

I highly recommend it for anyone who suffers from depression or cares for someone who does.  MOst moving for me are the author's personal accounts and the chapters on suicide and substance abuse.

These characters represent the swells of London and if people were really like this then you can see why the Empire fell.  But while the book has kooky scenes no one character is very memorable.

This is certainly a lovely and heartfelt book.  Swindoll's recollections about her childhood and her way into faith are inspiring and just plain interesting.  However, I really expected more Adventure.  We only get to hear a little but about her travels and I wish that had been a greater focus of the novel.  I think the author is a very satisfied human being with a nice life but not a particularly adventurous one, so, for me, the title was bit misleading.	2005-03-27

Franklin, Washington, Adams- three names that we have heard countlessly in school and as adults who are interested in history, yet who were real men with dreams, sorrows, ambitions.  In this book, the thoughts of these great people are conveyed with compassion, and the novel shows us how history can unfold from everyday events.  The descriptions of the Boston Massacre, Franklin's days of diplomacy in England and the Congressional debates are vivid and just plain interesting.  I am already reading The Glorious Cause, so Shaara obviously hooked me.	2004-12-02

Having read this, I imagine that other mystery greats (Christie for one) learned a thing or two about pacing and the psychological make-up of a crime.<br /><br />More than that, what I love about this book is the characters- especially Gilbert Betteridge, who is a funny, quirky first narrator and the detective who loves roses above crime.  Collins' book also struck me in that he writes female characters who are multi-dimensional and interesting, as opposed to some other Victorian authors of his day.  This is fantastic!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery but and also  wants to understand human nature and read a well-written novel.	2004-10-04

Myth and magic are integral parts of the plot- how two people drawn to each other must connect despite political and personal tribulation and how they use their faith as a way to deepen love.<br /><br />I thought the characters were interesting and multi-faceted, but still retained their legendary status.  Merlin is mysterious, flawed but giving and some of the less known characters (e.g. Brangwain) are fleshed out. Mark in particular is the kind of weak, manipulative character  you immediately resent.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most was the portrayal of the  religion of the characters and how they carried their faith in each aspect of their lives.<br /><br />There is also a comic subplot involving Arthur, Guinevere and a bastard child.<br /><br />Previously, I had not enjoyed this author's Guinevere books; to be honest, I barely made it through the first one, which was somewhat dull to me.

Rodriguez has a wonderful talent for writing in many ways and her pacing and diaogue are quite good.  Where the book failed for me is that I wasn't particulary drawn to all of the characters.  Two of the characters (Sara and Amber) feel more like they were included to make points about spousal abuse and politics.  They aren't very real characters and their voices get lost.  Maybe instead of six characters, there ought to only have been four.<br />Maybe I am critical b/c I am like the women in this novel: an American Latina in her late 20's.  I know women like the ones depicted here and the novel is broad in its appeal. The characters have different nationalities, skin tones, and religions.  That is all reflective of the Latina U.S. experience. However, how come everyone in this book has money to burn?  That certainly is unrealisitc considering their age.  And what's up with the men?  Absolutely no development there.  Again, the men feel like book characters;  even though that's what they are, as a reader I was super-conscious of the fact.<br /><br />This book is escapist fun  and has enough happy endings to satisfy a beach reader. Literature it's not, but it is a nice addition to the chick-lit genre.	2004-08-26

The language of the novel is rich and evocative and the book to me wasn't long, but complex. Don't read this if you don't want a longer novel you can involve yourself with.  Too many novels now skimp on details and this one is a wonderful, brave exception to the rule. If you want to immerse yourself in the story of one woman's road to recovery from heartbreak and her move into life, then you will like this.<br /><br />Yes, Langston Turner is verbose writer but it is all in keeping with the character, a woman seeking answers from God, from her conscience and who is flawed but learning. Elizabeth's conversion, her marriage, her role as Mother and teacher are all covered with depth.  I like that Elizabeth is a mature woman learnign to rectify her mistakes and opening herself up to different experiences. I also loved that this book is about POETRY. While I don't go around quoting poems frequently, I am the kind of person who loves them deeply and could relate to how Elizabeth uses words to shape her life.  I've never before read a 'Christian' novel but the artistry of ths novel convinced me that it is possible to send out that message in the modern world and also write something literary.	2004-08-04

Plus, I have read some other Bradford books and enjoyed them.  This novel feels incomplete; characters are flat and the storylines are are wrapped up too neatly for my taste.  In particular, the Alexa character gets on my nerves- too perfect to be true.  Bradford presents us with scenarios that could be interesting (all the women have great careers) but are undeveloped.  Only one plotline truly touched me and even that was rushed through.  Paris isn't even that integral a part of the book!  Thankfully, the book reads quickly.  I recommend THe Last Time I saw Paris by Elizabeth Adler instead of this book if you are looking for something romantic, interesting and with more vivid Parisian scenes.	2004-06-06

Zinn focuses only on the dark aspects and primarily on the U.S. role in international politics.  I have enjoyed and been informed by Zinn's work in the past but I found this book overly simplistic.  While my politics are left leaning, i find that many historians on the left write about the world as if everything that happens in the world is a conspiracy- human psychology, sociological trends, even religion never enter Zinn's mind as reasons for the march of history.  The 'America is bad' view of life is irratatingly simplistic.  That said, Zinn is an expert on Vietnam and his work is an antidote to the skewed history textbooks we were forced to read in high school.  I recommend this but also think it is necessary to not accpet everything in the book as a rock solid truth.	2004-03-19

The psychology, subtlety of narrative and memorable characters (Old Jolyon being my favorite in a book chock full of interesting characters) are all above and beyond most novels i have read.  There is something wonderful about the scale of the novel and I would often find myself weeping while reading this- people often create their own tragedies and those moments are worth reading about.  Simply perfect.	2004-03-19

I felt deeply compelled to keep reading this interesting family saga but was very disappointed by the last section where Foster goes to learn the truth behind the mystery of his grandmother's life.  It falls flat and is just disturbing but not truthful sounding.  What I liked best was the story of the  love between Leah and Norman and the parts where Foster grows to know his 2 Aunts, who are the best characters inthe book.  Much of the praise for this book is about the language and the depth of the story but I have to agree with some who criticize and say it often feels contrived.  Still, I feel Mr. Lent did a fine job and has great promise.	2003-11-26

The writing is gripping but at times scattered.  The friendship between Mingus and Dylan is the focal point of the novel yet at times, seems less like a real friendship than a novelist's creation of one.  Additionally, the grown-up Dylan is not especially compelling.  The tragedy of the book is that Mingus' life is short-changed, especially as his story is the most interesting.  Yet, with all my complaints, I really enjoyed this novel and the descriptions of a Brooklyn world I will never know.	2003-11-14

Maggie is a girl with depth and true character and her brother simply considers her rebellious.  The novel is a fascinating look at an insular world, social constraints and the place of Woman.  I found the family discussions comic and truthful, and Maggie's later struggles very real.  The ending left me tired and feeling somewhat manipulated . . .but also weeping.  Truly great.	2003-11-14

This was a dramatic novel, one I saved for years to read on cold, solitary nights with the wind blowing outside.  It is a bleak tale of intermingled love stories.  Eustacia isn't easy to love but she is far more determined and interesting than other characters in the classic lit canon.  Clym is compelling in a different way.  This is a novel, for me, of the human capacity to misunderstand and blame rather than try to communicate the heart's true desires.  Very, very moving.	2003-11-14

My favorites have been &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; and &quot;Sula&quot; but this is will definitely go in my top three.  It is an accessible, complusively readable book.  I lingered over descriptions.  The power of Morrison's writing is such that she can say very much in very few words. The psychological complexity of the women in this novel is immeasurable.  I really liked these characters, their feuds, their irrational love for Bill Cosey, who is a marvel of a character as well.  I am so glad Morrison wrote this rich and vital work.	2003-11-14
US	48130944	RQE2L3UJFSGB	0374121230	598950109	Child of My Heart	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Melancholy	This is a difficult book to appraise.  My reaction is based on the affection I have for the characters, especially the girls Theresa is nurturing the summer this story takes place during.  There is something lonely and unsettled about Theresa's life and about her charges Daisy and Flora.  Parents and adults in this book are not very imaginative or involved but are not dilikeable either.  The novel is really about loss and the beautiful frailty of remembered moments.  McDermott is a stunning writer.<br />Many other readers took offense to the 'creepy' relationship between the artist father of Flora (who seems very Picasso-like to me) and Theresa but I felt there was a certain reality to it.  Beautiful young women, which is precisely what Theresa is becoming, are often drawn to old men with talent. It is a fact of the world.  His sexuality must be potent for he is still a man who commands several women in his life.  As inexplicable as it may seem to some of us, it does happen.  Theresa almost behaves in a dreamlike maner around him, perhaps a form of rebellion against the cautious dreams her parents have formed on her behalf.<br />A book I would recommend to anyone who likes a nostalgic, yet not sugary coming-of-age novel.	2003-08-17

I felt that the conclusion rolled along too quickly without the crystal clear detail that made the rest of the novel so enjoyable. Perhaps the author is planning a sequel- I certainly feel that there is more story here to be told.  This said, I found this book incredibly moving and realistic.  Another Amazon reviewer said that the scenes of rape and alcoholism are degrading; I could NOT disagree more. I wish no one had to deal with such terrible trauma but that is life and it is handled very well in this novel.  My favorite characters, beside spunky and worn-out Darla, are Elijah and Pearl.  There is much here to discuss and become fascinated by.  I highly recommend this novel.	2003-08-06

She can use language well, has somewhat interesting characters (although not believable ones) and paces her story dramtically.  Those few positives can't help the fact that this is a terrible book.  The storyline, which could have been a fascinting look at the coping mechanisms of children who survived the murder of a parent by the other parent, is instead a VC Andrews tale of incest and murder.  Nothing that happens even remotely resembles reality.  Furthermore, the over the top use of WORDS in CAPITAL letters is annoying, as are the characterizations of both Misty and Amber.  These two characters are so unsympathetic that you can't imagine caring for them.  I am shocked that Oprah picked this for her club because the story is just so over-the-top; it is steeped in bathos.  What starts off promising descends to a level of Gothic melodrama so perverse (becuase the author chooses to throw many Jerry Springer type cliches into the mix) you'd almost laugh if you didn't realize you just spent a day reading the novel.	2003-07-31

It is an evocative read and even musical in tone.  I love the asides such as Barney in Paris (the comparison of Barney to Bill Clinton is Priceless) and the stories about his child are charming.  The only thing this book lacks (and this could be my personal bias) is a description of married life for the couple in Paris.  What IS married life in Paris like for two Americans??

Therefore, I was intrigued by the idea of a novel about this mysterious creature.  The pseudo-autobiography is quite breezy- indeed, I finished the book in hours. I enjoyed the parts of Virginie's story prior to posing for Sargent, especially the scenes in Louisiana, which breathe with life and detail.  The rest of the novel definitely falls flat and there is no conclusion, but rather an abrupt end.  Still, if you are facinated by the topic, it is a worthy addition to the Madame X library.	2003-04-21

I was not that enthusiatic about The Virgin in te Garden but this book was amazing on every level.  I love the development of these characters (who seem very real, very Known to me).  Frederica is especially well developed. Her intelligence and lack of self-knowledge are an endearing package. I personally love the intricate explanations of ideas- it is refreshing to read about things that I think about and yet have never found elsewhere.  My only real probelm with the book is that the author's voice intrudes too much; it isn't necessary to me to be AWARE of the fact that this is a novel.  Byatt almost wants us to be aware that this is fiction when I would always rather be in that pleasant state of believing in the fiction.  But overall, I couldn't put this book down; what happens at the end is shockingly sad.  I wonder what book 3 in the series will bring.	2003-04-20

Between religion, insanity and adolescent angst, there are enough subplots for a four hundred page novel. Instead,Goldberg gives us a rough portrait of four people at a crossroads.  The adult characters are not very sympathetic; only Elly is really compelling. What is superb in the novel is the tone the author uses to describe such things as spelling bee culture, teachers, temples. She is much better with ideas than with the consequences of familial devastation.  Much is left unresolved- does Elly have a real mystical experience, what will happen to the mother and will Aaron really convert?  However, I liked this novel because it was different. It described the way religion is all consuming and  the way parents sometimes use their children for their own ego drives quite thoughtfully.  I found this a provocative read.	2003-04-14

Steinbeck was a wizard of desription and characterization.  His book challenges you to see the world with new eyes- the unfairness of things as well as the beauty of small gestures.  I am shocked by some of the negative Amazon reviews.  It appears that some of those writing have no concept about the ideas presented in this novel or are in denial about American history.  But getting back to this book: read it slowly, linger over Tom and Ma and Rose of Sharon and their sorrows, their daily sacrifices.

Barry Glassner, a sociologist, debunks many of the myths of our time.  I was horrified by how duped we have all been about subjects such as illness and crime, especially by the media and politicians. One wonderful thing about this book is that it can alleviate your anxiety level about the world and make you see that life is safer than you thought.  However, Glassner also points out there are areas Americans do not even consider which should really trouble us.  Overall, I found this balanced and fair, not to mention interesting.  This is one of those books you will find recommending to friends and then discussing.  A fine work.	2003-03-24

The main thrust of the novel has to do with a legal battle a COuntess and her daughter, Lady Anna, engage in to assert their legal rights after having been abused by an evil Earl, who married and abandoned the Countess.  To assert these rights, a demand is made by the mother to the daughter that she wed her cousin, although no one guesses that Anna is already engaged to the poor tailor who has been her one true friend in life.<br />I enjoyed many aspects of the novel, primarily how the mother-daughter relationship plays out.  The subplot of the book is that we all must separate from Mother, and make our own way, our own decisions.  This Mother is especially hard-hearted and single-minded and acts very melodramatically in one scene to the tailor (a really weird, overblown scene I could have lived without and which was incidentally, albeit unintentionally, funny).<br />Anna herself is a character with many virtues. She Almost gives in but does not do so because she is guided by an internal voice of loyalty.  Her love on the other hand is drawn realistically if not in a flattering way. Daniel is almost an anti-hero.  Not entirely sympathetic, you learn to like him because he seems real.  The 'triangle' between those two and Lord Lovel is well-depicted, and no character comes off as 'the baddie.'<br />Another aspect I respected was the depiction of law, and how society restrains its denizens into conventional and superficial marriages.  I disagree with the previous reviewer who said this was a light novel.  I think there are very dark moments and a suspicion about the characters' motives at every turn.  Yet, there is decency in many characters: Anna herself and the Solicitor-General being the obvious ones.<br />I liked this immensely, despite it being overlong and having some over-the-top moments that did not 'go' with the rest of the novel.  Still, the novel has great style.	2003-03-21

There was much I found commendable:  the attempt to write from a male point of view, the contemplation of cultures and the assertionof female rights by a good female character. There is even humor in this book (the description of the students made me laugh aloud), but I disliked the obviousness of the novel: it is easy to predict.  I was also very disturbed by the character's xenophobia and attacks on Catholicism, although those were the prevalent English views of the time.  This book is really for people who want to see how the great Bronte developed as an artist and one of the finest writers of the English language.	2003-03-18

It starts off with a portrait of family pain so crisp and expertly written that your own heart and gut will feel the wound.  However, that novel with its dramatic realism and captivating portraits (Susie, Lindsey and their Dad) veers off into a landscape I disliked:  the characters of Mr.Harvey and Abigail are essentially not well-described and the tone for both is indefinite.  But the real flaw of the book is an ending ... that reads as tacked on, almost compulsively Cheerful. It is a false cheer and the opposite of the rest of the book.

I like Frederica, despite realizing she is not very sympathetic.  My only issue with the book is that there are some moments of indescribable bordom when reading about the Potter boy.  He is troubled and sometimes the scenes of him trying to discover comfort in the world read as hilarious, but often as not they made me want to snooze.

I love that authors can rework fairy tales, but usually there is one character with whom you can sympathize.  I had no such feeling here.  Tainth Lee is obviously an intelligent author- the idea of combining the Demeter-Persephone myth with that of Snow White is clever but I had no connection to the characters, who mainly seem like ideas, not people.	2003-02-23

Read it because you like tough heroines who can work real magic with animals.  Read it because you can delve into a world that seems extremely pleasant to live in.  The book had certain flaws:  the character of Katriona was much more compelling to me than Rosie herself.  Also, the villainess was never a fully realized character.  That said, a lovely way to wile away the hours,	2003-02-23

Don't read this if you want some kind of instruction on how to develop your own connection to that Intelligence.  A pretty book nonetheless.	2003-02-23

This is a profoundly sad, often hopeless look at one man's life and the two women he is involved with.  There is nothing in this novel to cheer the heart but the writing is textured and alluring.  Certain sentences leap off the page to tug at your heart.  Also, the twist at the end really does leave a reader surprised.  Life can be like this book sadly enough.	2003-02-23

Frida was a one-of-a-kind artist and person and this is a humane account of her work, her relationships and her beliefs.  One reviewer found the diary entries and letters tedious- I found their inclusion necessary to uncovering the psychology of an artist. I loved that Herrera combines scholasticism with compassion.  This is a necessary addition to your collection if Frida is an artist you respect.	2003-02-23

I was not pleased with the Aunt Helen twist- it feels like every movie and book uses a similar storyline. Overall, good	2003-02-22
US	48130944	R1GXEBQEDSKHJW	0446673323	172395123	Dr. Neruda's Cure for Evil	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Thought provoking but ultimately shallow	The first and second divisions of the book are incredibly well written.  The dialogue, settings and explanations of the genuinely awful things that occur to the main character and his patient are enthralling.  The reason I can't rate this novel higher is that the final third of the book, while interesting, does not capture me as being in sync with the rest of the novel.  We are supposed to believe that Dr. Neruda, a man who spent most of his life up until that point helping children who suffered tortures, would behave in a basically evil way to 'cure' two socially unredeemable characters.  I can't buy it and frankly, I don't think the author was very good at describing his concept of evil.<br />According to this author, the likes of Hitler and Stalin weren't evil, but the two businesspeople Neruda hunts after in a chilling manner are.  Strange, but true.  Granted, these characters are incredibly dislikeable, and Halley in particular is the least engaging character in the book.  Perhaps Yglesias' failure to make these two characters intriguing is what emotionally distanced me from the finale of the novel.  I was left thinking, is the author trying to show that evil is as evil does, that there is a certain banality and randomness to true evil? If so, aren't those obvious points already?<br />The characters that are built up and introduced in parts 1 and 2 of the novel were fantastic and quite real.  What Yglesias does to some of them in part 3 is deeply boring.	2002-04-16
US	48130944	RDH06AEFE9QKA	0061054437	206571138	Waking the Moon	Books	2	21	36	N	N	Trite and unconvincing	I was quite aggravated that I spent a couple of days of my life reading this novel.  At first, the style of the book was quite gripping but after part 1 this pseudo- literary attempt flounders.  The characters are described effectively but one never gets to the heart of their personalities.  Frankly, several elements of the story are laughable: the Benandanti, the romance of Sweeney and Dylan being just two.  As a Goddess worshipper I was not delighted with the overall hostile tone of the novel towards Goddess spirituality; don't fool yourself into thinking this is is a feminist take on Goddess craft. Plus, some of her 'facts' about particular Goddesses are wrong.<br />I would have liked this book more if Hand had not described everyone's outfits and faces in such mind-numbing ways.  Many pages of this book leave you bored, bored, bored!  Read this if you go more for style over substance.	2002-02-11
