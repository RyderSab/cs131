This may be a Newbury Award winner for children's literature, but I'm 23 and it kept me interested and in suspense the whole time.  The interlacing of the two stories, the present centering around Stanly and the past centering around the \\"ancient\\" Green Lake its seedy past, are perfect and masterful.  The characters are simply done, but they have a massive dynamic, taking on a whole new life after \\"building character.\\"  It's a great adventure, a riveting drama, a raucous comedy and has one of the most satisfying and redeming endings I've read in any novel, current or classic.  This is great for every reader of every age.  I give it my highest recommendation possible!	2004-02-06

It's full of love, humour, mystery, tension, soul searching and double edged swords.  It's big city meets small town and it's a clash of two different worlds.<br />Billy Ansell is one of the most dynamic characters ever in the rpinted word.  He suffers from the death of his wife, but has to add to that the death of his kids.  He remains a champion of human decency when he deals with Mitchell Stephens, as complex a character can get without carrying his skeletons with him instead of leaving them in the closet.  <br />The story is simple and complex, thus comes the movie tagline, \\"There is no such thing as the simple truth.\\"  The simple truth is, however, that this is one of the greatest English language novels of the last 20 years.  It receives my highest recommendation possible.	2003-04-03
US	46572916	R3GF35QSI78RA	0767904419	140094580	Northern Lights	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Good debut novel	Excellent debut novel, but Tim O'Brien only got better.  All of his tension and emotion in present in this novel, but he still had yet to develope his style and language that has made him, in my opinion, one of America's best writers today.<br />It's a story about privacy.  Private lives at home and secret romances of sorts and the return of a Vietnam vet who has a constant reminder of his time In Country, but he never tells the secret of how he received the injury to his ear.<br />It's an excellent debut novel, but don't be discouraged if this is the first Tim O'Brien novel you read, he only get's better.  I give it my highest recommendation.<br />It's adventurous and tense when the brothers are lost in the woods.  O'Brien paints an impressive picture of the Minnesota woods when these brothers travel at the feet of these enormous snow covered trees in awe and reverence of nature.	2002-12-19

Once again, as with Northern Lights, it is disconnected from Vietnam, but it has ties.  Tom Chippering is a veteran and their is a chapter dealing with it, holding true to Tim's faithfullnes to his past.<br />However, if there is anything Tim is great at writing it's the human psyche under any circumstance.  Here, he beautifully portrays a pathetic, middle-aged sex addict who isn't very good at his antics of screw everything I can.  He has charm, but is too hung up on his past to use it to its full potential.  Instead, he is hellbent on seeking revenge upon his ex-wife, a disturbed in her own way, obsession of Chippering's.  It has humor and drama, skepticism and redemption.<br />It isn't normal Tim O'Brien.  If you've read The Things They Carried, Going After Cacciato or If I Die In A Combat Zone and you really liked those for being about Vietnam, then this is not for you.  But if you are a fan of literature in general and Tim O'Brien's beautiful language and, in my eyes, flawless style, then please, buy a copy of this and enjoy it.  It is easily readable in a day or two because there is a subtle tension that sneaks up on you and grabs hold right at the end, so you're thankful you didn't put it down.  This is a great novel.  I give it my highest recommendation.	2002-12-19
US	46572916	R1XAOZJE2WSUYO	0670031178	14981931	Richmond Burning: The Last Days of the Confederate Capital	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Historical excellence	Nelson Lankford has constructed one of the finest books on the final stages of the war in Virginia/Richmond.  This is not a historical account this is an adventure.  I read this like a great mystery novel, not having any idea what comes next.  His words are astonoshingly well crafted and he takes pain staking ease to sew in the relevent historical data to teach you a lesson.<br />The best part of the book is the quotes.  Most of them come from civilian actors in the Richmond drama.  I've read many books on the war and I hold a Bachelors degree in history, soon to being graduate work on my Masters and I could care less what soldiers and officers and politicians have to say about the war.  I get a good enough idea about battlefield situations from narratives by McPherson and Foote.  This is a wonderful effort about the civilian consequences surrounding the overtaking of a city.<br />Like I said, this is an adventure.  Yes, the Union won the war.  But this book keeps you on such pins and needles that you don't know how it's going to end.  Every others sentence for the first few chapters is about the approaching Union army.  It just made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck like watching a well constructed scene from Hitchcock.  <br />The historical data is pertinent and on point.  There are no useless random facts in here like how many horses jumped the fence in front of the stone wall before the defending general had his crouching ranks stand up and fire.  Everything in here is important, but not too much to handle.  The blend of narrative and historical data is 100% balanced out to give you a satisfying read.  Even if you can't stand history, you read this and forget it's about history because it isn't a battle retelling.<br />This is one of the finest books about the history of the Civil War I have read since James McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom.&quot;  Is it worth the money?  You bet.  Is it worth a second and third read?  You bet.  Is it worth recommending to your freidns after you read it so they can know what really happened and how?  You bet.  Most importantly, is it essential for everyone's understanding about history, some of the most important history our nation has ever seen, the most pivotal of events in the most pivotal of times in our nations history?  You better believe it.<br />Mr. Lankford and &quot;Richmond Burning&quot; receive my highest recommendation.	2002-09-27

This man lived nothing less than an adventure.  He was strong willed and of a fervent opinion, but like many of America's founding brothers, he had his faults.  It seems as if every early American was sex maniac.  Today's scandals pale in comparison to some of the exploits of the late 18th century.<br />But enough of that, this is an excellent book.  Mr. Brands has put forth a worthy effort of the highest praise, his synthesis of historical fact, historical fiction and storytelling is superb.  His reputation has preceded him, but there is one flaw in the book.  It is incredibly hard to read.  I have a degree in history and have read many history books, but this is one of the more difficuly I have ever read.  It ranks up their with The Swordbearers, the history of World War I and The Age Of Jackson, the Pulitzer Prize winning history of America during the Crisis perido leading up to the Civil War.<br />Don't be intimidated, this is an excellent book.  It is worth the money to buy and is more than worth the time and effort to read.  If you want to understand anything about the American Revolution on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, you must read this book.  Ben Franklin was instrumental in his role in securing deals with France to win our independence.  This gets my highest recommendation.	2002-09-23

He is the central figure in establishing the Federal Bank, as different as it is today from what it was then.  He is responsible for the majority of the Federalist Papers, the most important documents produced in support of the Federal Constitutuon and the heated debates it entailed.  But another thing most people don't know is that he is an American Revolution hero, serving, with distinction under Geroge Washington, receiving his highest praise and becoming his right hand man.  He is the most elegant and gifted of writers.  To understand his beginnings, read Alexander Hamilton: American by Richard Brookheiser, and understand the humble beginnings he was born into, working as a store clerk in the West Indies, educating himself in America and turning himself into one of the Americans who has a true grasp on the English language.  His politics aside, he was a brilliant man.  He was a gentleman and he was honest.  He was a mna full of pride and great courage.  He refused to let himself be bad mouthed, accepting Aronn Burr's duel, but he refused to fire at his opponent, instead firing into the air.  A very honourable end to a great American.  His writing are essntial to understand his life and his mind, his political orientation and lifelong goals.  Not only that, but this is great literature.  This receives my highest recommendation.	2002-08-05

Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead.  It's pretentious and long winded and just awful.  I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots.  But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through.	2002-08-05

Hardly; I'm 22 and most people I know that have read these are my age.  They're so much fun and they are incredibly original.  Some of the best new stories and books ever conceived.  Don't let the witchraft and wizardy detract you from reading this, their truly great.  Forget the \\"evil\\" implications or the promotion of the Devil, it's not about that at all.  Besides, kids don't even understand that sort of thing when they're at the reading age of these books.  Bottom line, I give them about 15 stars each, so thats about 60 total stars in all.  I give these my highest recommendation and I am so excited for the next movie to come out, Chamber of Secrets on Novemeber 15th, and where, oh where, are the next three books!?!	2002-08-05

The dates run from about 1764, with the passage of the Sugar Act to 1783 the Peace of Paris was decided, or even as late as 1787 when Delaware became the first state in the Union.  However you look at it, there is no one text that gives you a better, more thorough telling and understanding of the most important time in out history, before we officially had a country to even have a history, than The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution by Bernard Bailyn.  This is the most thorough and most balanced fusion of primary documents and secondary analysis.  Every topic is important every conclusion is crucial to understanding the truth about this great and terrible period in our history.  It receives my highest recommendation.	2002-08-05

It is without a doubt the greatst detective mystery story ever told.  The characters are memorable, it is Sherlock Holmes after all, and Watson.  But the images are magical, the Moores are just so mysterious in their descriptions and their mystery is overhwleming when someone looks out over them, peering through a thick fog, listening for the howl of the hound.  A masterpiece that gets my highest recommedation.	2002-08-05

The American Revolution was the first major event to happen in American history and on American soil. This should be two 1200 page volumes of primary documents, from the front and from the generals headquarters and from most importantly, American citizen's diaries, both American and British alike.<br />The tactics employed were very European, still tuilizing the same old firing line: fire until more of them fall. Canonballs were there to roll along the ground or hit someone in mid-air and leave a three foot hole coming, so there is no real need for battle descriptions. But maneuvers and tactics taken on the road to battle is the most fascinating topic. How close did two passing armies get to encountering one another? What happened to the prongs of the Burgoyne, St. Leger and Lord Cornwallis in the attack? We know they never made it, but how do they feel about it? This has so much potential.<br />The funny part is seeing how the language was used back then and the gross spelling errors, spelling words how they sound which makes too much sense, that has changed into complexity today. However, the range of documents is excellent, both soldier and civilian alike, because obviously everyone is at war. It is an especially excellent read because when writing was the only form of communication, that is when people had a better grasp on it, writing in a such better language and style than anyone does today. Yes, this recieves my highest recommendation and I wish everyone would read it, but don't stop here. Start with this wonderful collection and move on to The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution by Bernard Bailyn so you know how it started, excellent use of primary documents, then The Glorious Cause by Robert Middlekauf to get a better understanding of the events from a secondary document point of view. This receives my highest recommendation.	2002-08-05

I had to read this as an assignment and then write a three page paper on the question, What Is Memory? After reading this, I got no better sense of what my memories are or how my memory works let alone what the hell I'm supposed to get from her memories. This is entirely all over the place, no two sentences come from or go to the same place and I think there is about one, maybe two complete sentences to boot. The color chapters are just lists of what she remembers being that color. I find it hard to care because I already know what that color is and what things are that color. Thanks for the childrens book chapters thrown in there. Other than that, it makes no sense. Far too much poetry attempted to be squeezed into an essay style format. Just not good.	2002-08-05

The American Civil War is not over.  The truth is seemingly hard to swallow.  Follow along with Horwitz as he embarks on his own literary Civil Wargasm and find out the lingering history of the Southern involvement in the Civil War.  It is beautifull written, very easy to understand, it reads more like a novel than a history book, but you learn just as much history and you do social commentary.

It is full of romance gained, romance lost and the romance felt deep inside every man, the romanticism of love of country, liberty and freedom.  It's full of heroism and horror, deception, betrayal, dissapointment and heartache.  Valjean is redeemed by a man he beats and steals from and he is miraculously changed around and goes on the most wonderful transformation, even on the run from the devious and sinister, unrelenting Javert , Prefect of Police.  Marius and Enjolres are inspiring in their energetic and brave characters.  The innocence of childhood, Eponine and Cosette both and the Friends Of the ABC.  This is a dark and mysterious, thirlling and suspensful, the scene when Marius is just a thin wall away when Valjean and Cosette are next door with the Thenardiers has me covered in goose bumps as I balance on the edge of my seat.  This is a truly magical and inspired novel, suitable for all ages, recommended for all ages and is required reading for anyone who read this review.

All you want is for this big goof Lenny to get his warm so he can be warm and loving as he is deep down inside and raise him some rabbits.

Small and insignificant man going after that elusive prize he has been striving for his entire life.  Who cares that sharks ate away everything but the tail and the head.  It's like an orgasm.  You work and you work, you build and you build and then the moment comes.  Who cares how good it was getting there, the climax felt great.  And that is what this is all about.

It's the typical Gothic style story, but Harris has someone levels and paths and doorways to send you down and put you through that you just can't put it down.  I read the first six chapters for class one day and read the rest of it the next day because it is just that good.  It has intelligence and wit and sharp suspense and bone chilling thill rides on ever page.  How is any one person supposed to able to have such a masterful grasp on the English language.

If one person is capable of such art and beauty, you want them to write every word in their head.  Alas, no.  But that's it, there is no greater American novel, and I will argue with anyone who dares to prove to me otherwise.  It is the classic tale of growing and learning life.

Its message is important, but the one thing that makes this so great: it has no punctuation.  The speed and pace with which you read this novel aids in the action and the message of the story.  This was the inspiration for the Metallica song and video &quot;One,&quot; to aid in the visual placement.  It's about a hunk of meat in a hospital bed, no senses, not ability tp speak.  It is the best depiction of the horrors of war that can ever be captured in the written word or on screen, as this novel was in a movie of the same name.  You learn the torment and suffering and pain of losing all hope, knowing that you went to war and had your life ended, even though your still alive.  You're inside this mans head, thinking what he thinks just as if you were thinking it all for yourself.  The message is clear and it has a lot of supporting evidence.  Trumbo is relentless in voicing his opinion of anti-war sentments.  You know very soon that he against the thought of war.  But don't even think about the message it is supposed to be delivering, read it for the pure literary merit that it oozes from every page, from every line, from every word.  It's astonishing.	2002-08-02

Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment.  That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it.  It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs...	2002-08-02

How can one person know so much about ourselves and everyone?  Carver has been in all of our heads and has put us all down on paper, exposing us for who we are and what we really think about.  Cathedral is the highlight of this collection.  The images that are conjured up when a blind man help a man with perfect sight learn how to draw a cathedral he sees on televison is the most moving set of words I have ever read.  These stories make you wonder what you are really like and then you realize that he's right, this is what you're like.  A coaxing baker torments a family by hounding them about a cake they haven't picked up for their dead sons birthday.  They confront him and he ends up being the grounding force for these grieving parents, the voice of reason and sensibility that brings them back to normal.  These stories are wonderfully simple and simply perfect.	2002-08-02

I hate to say that I laughed at David Sedaris' past, his life, but I couldn't help it. This is the most side splitting memoir I have ever read. The most enduring image I have is when Sedaris says he used to mow the lawn in a football helmet. No one semed to understand why I laughed so hard at it, but you just can't help but laugh. But above all, you can't help but be impressed with how soothing and simple Sedaris' writing is. It's painful and redeeming, but all in all, it's excellent.	2002-08-02

There is this girl who likes to shop lift, works in a theatre, goes home to her little brother.  It's us, beautifully written and immaculately realized.  Tobias Wolff is gold and everything he touches turns just the same.  Read this, then &quot;The Night In Question&quot; and then read &quot;This Boy's Life.&quot;  Read his made up words and then read his personally inspired words and found out just what he had to go through, how he triumphed over adversities to become the best short story writer out there today.	2002-08-02

He's the kind of writer you just want to be like more than anything, but you can not master his style, it's one of a kind. This is a suspensful story, full of tense moments when you don't know if Dwight is going to start beating him or if the store clerk is going to bust him for forging a check. This is just so well written that I can not possibly find one flaw, it's just impossible. His writing is superb and his memoirs are brilliant. Read this and his collections of short stories, most notably \\"The Night In Question\\" and \\"Back In The World.\\" Then when you're done reading those, read them again because they deserve to be read more than once. But of course, if you read them, you'll understand what I'm talking about and you won't need my recommendation to read them again.	2002-08-02

It is a thorough telling of the tales in which innocence is lost and wisdom is gained.  I am glad that O'Brien toured in Vietnam or else we would not have been blessed with such a wondeful work of literature.  Just read the last few lines over and over.  They'll make you cry.

The words are so beautiful that you forget you're reading about Vietnam.  This is a gripping and intensely told tale of personal convictions and soldierly duty.  Read this book.  Read every O'Brien book.  His words are inspiring and thgouth provoking.  Hie style is truly original and he has risen to the rank of the greatest writer of his generation.  I give this novel my highest recommendation to any one interested in Vietnam or just reading good literature.	2002-08-01

Then again, even that wouldn't be enough.  These are wondeful explorations of the human psyche and spirit.  No two are similar yet they are all a piece of the whole.  The whole: exactly what we humans are, what we do and why.  I recently bought Back In The World and I can not wait to finish it and read it again and again, just as I have with The Night In Question.  M.J. Iuppa, thank you so much for assigning this to us to read for class, it was beautiful and imaginative and I just can't get enough.  Read it, read it, read it!!!  Especially Powder.  It's so innocent yet so daring, so intriguing yet so secretive.  Then again, all of them are, trust me.  It doesn't get much better than this.	2002-07-04

Tim O'Brien painted a masterpiece of geography and landscape out of the most vile and disgusting conflict our nation has ever embarked upon.  After finishing \\"If I Die In A Combat Zone: Box Me Up And Ship Me Home,\\" \\"Going After Cacciato\\" and \\"The Things They Carried,\\" arguably the finest of these three works of literature, I have become intrigued with this episode in history, more so than any history book could have ever accomplished.  I detest this period in history, as a historian of late 17th to middle 18th century American history.  This period is mere current events still.  However, O'Brien is a master.  His words are beautiful.  <br />\\"The Things They Carried\\" is the only work of literature I hated to see end.  \\"If I Die In A Combat Zone\\" was wonderful; he made Vietnam sound beautiful and captivating.  I would loved to have continued reading his memoirs of his tour of duty, however, I'm glad his memoirs ended.  The last few lines of \\"IIDIACZ\\" are exquisite.  I cried.  I cried out of jealousy of his talents.  I graduated with an English/Writing minor and I hate Tim O'Brien for how well he writes.  \\"Going After Cacciato\\" is phenomenal.  It is engrossing.  You can know nothing about Vietnam ahead of time, read these works and learn more from the source than some second hand account in a text book could ever offer.  <br />He teaches now in Texas, creative writing, and I would kill to be able to hear his wisdom on the craft.  Every American entering college programs should be required to read one of, if not all, of his works.  They are vivid and descriptive and overflowing with artistry.  He has taken writing to a new level of accomplishment.  To understand what it means to write is to read Tim O'Brien.    I'm not going to try and sell you on the technical aspects of his writing, I could care less.  The substance and story stand alone.  His language, voice and other grammatical jargon are meaningless when you read him.  It can't be described, just experienced.  <br />EXPERIENCE TIM O'BRIEN!!!	2002-05-21
US	46572916	R1U2M3ZV6L0TB0	0767902890	852411699	The Things They Carried	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	One of the finest English language books ever written.	This may be a series of personal and emotional accounts to O'Brien, but because of his writing style and the impact the Vietnam Conflict had on both him and everyone else in the Vietnam era, the reader can't help but ultimatley feel as if they are walking behind O'Brien in formation, seeing everything he sees and going everywhere he goes.  <br />No book has ever captured that elusive truth of what it was like in such startling fashion as The Things They Carried.  No book has ever captured the effect it had on those involved years after it happened as The Things They Carried.  <br />If this were made into a motion picture, I feel it would be superior to the most similar Platoon.  His style is beautiful and effective and in the end it delivers a satisfying read.  I can honestly say that of all the books I have ever read, this is the only book of all of those that I hated to see end.	2001-06-07
