After reading some of his posts and thinking he had a pretty witty attitude (not quite Oscar Wildean, more like the savvy street hustler Wilde just tricked with), I decided to buy his book and see what all his fuss was about. <br /> <br />I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />His poems range in emotion from angry to somber to needy but they all manage to convey his feelings through the words, the page, the book and into the mood of the reader. I was moved often and never bored. Some pieces are especially funny and poke fun at popular culture and politics. <br /> <br />A great book. I wish I could hear the poems performed.	2005-03-03

Visit the site and you'll see they only publish professional work (and are recognized by SFWA as a professional-level magazine) and many of the stories have been nominated for the Nebula or included in various Year's Best titles.  <br />The book holds a rich mix of prose and poem, of fantasy and science-fiction, of whimsy and seriousness.  I can tell who are the up-and-coming authors by looking at the Table of Contents.  I look forward to reading more 'annuals' from the magazine.  There is something, no more like many things, about the book that will appeal to a wide variety of readers.	2004-01-21

The romance seemed a bit forced and rushed.  Also the evil brother made me think melodrama!  I guess that was what the author was seeking but for me it just made me wince when I read his sections.  Not sure if I would read more by the author.  Maybe.	2004-01-18

Elgin manages to capture one of the woes of contemporary life, the fact that so many of us simply are not hearing our loved ones, our friends, and our fellow man. We are beginning to shunt away from others and in doing so make our own lives lessen and become miserable.<br />Enter PEACETALK 101. This book offers guidance in the form of a story, instruction that is entertaining and enthralling. I liked the element of the fantastical that keeps the reader involved and wondering all throughout the story.<br />A great work of inspirational speculative fiction.	2003-06-11

I would view it on par with any graphic novel. The artwork is simply a delight, with each page containing subt;e whimsy and ghoulish touches. I simply love the ghostly bugs doomed to haunt the Spider's abode, who attempt to warn the Fly.<br />DiTerlizzi well deserves the acclaims and sales for this book.

There is simply so much between the covers that, on any given day or mood, you can randonly turn to a page and start and be enthralled by what you find.  I don't normally read poetry, but some of the lines/verses were so witty and so imaginative that I found myself smiling as I read.  I can see myself turning again and again, for entertainment and inspiration, to this book.	2002-10-30

I haven't been a teen in a few years but I felt like this book was still written for me.  The language is rich and decadent, like some Parisian dessert bought at a late-night cafe.  The characters were well-developed and realistic - I wish I had friends and foes like Kaye and Corny and Nephamael.  The plot has enough suspense and twists and turns to satisfy even finicky readers.  Black has redefined faeries, with the modern edge of a straight razor yet without ever losing sight of their original folklore.  My bookshelf eagerly aways her next release.	2002-09-25

It cant be his writing.  It just cant!  The characters were so cliche here.  Like they were pulled from another book of his, given a different name and hair color and yet they're the same.

These days, any ... writer with an idea, time on his/her hands, and some money can publish a book and get it listed on Amazon.  Camping in the Backyard is a perfect example of this.  IUniverse does it again - no editing, no spell check, no sense.  Are gay readers so desperate for romantic stories that they are willing to praise any book that offers them a little hope at the expense of good writing?  I am beginning to think so from this books rank because I found it dreadful.  There are so many better authors out there.  Zatti, if you read this, I have two words for you next time before you decide to publish a book:  writing workshop!	2002-07-31

I had always known that Early Christianity 'borrowed' from pagan religions some holidays and practices, but it was not until I read this book did I know the depth of theft.  Almost like a plaigarism of faith intended to convert the masses (which it sadly succeeded in doing).  The only part of the book I disliked was the final material, in which the author offers a new religion of sorts which is very metaphysical and a little dull.  But the rest of the book is a keeper.	2002-06-04

Devoted Christians should definitely stay away not only from this book but also from this author... better he should spend the time trying to improve his writing skills and reading the Good Book (if there's no profanity in the Bible why should there be any in this series?).

Everything he wrote, everything up to and including LAST CALL, I considered the most brilliant books.  Pirates, English poets, avatars of King Arthur, poker games with Tarot.  I mean he has an amazing imagination and I was drawn in.  Then things took a turn for the worst.  Too many characters that I didn't care about.  Situations that started to ... dare I say it... disinterest me.  The 2nd and 3rd books in his 'trilogy' were unnecessary and I disliked what he did to characters I had fallen for.  Then came a new book, DECLARE, and I thought, hey, he's no doubt gone back to his roots.  But I could not finish the book.  I was lost, bored even, buried beneath too much detail and slow pacing that jumped time streams needlessly.  Whatever intrigue and suspense was abandoned by the slow pacing, whiny love affairs, and niddling facts.  I miss my old Tim Powers, the one that knew that the story, the plot, came first and took you on a breathtaking trip to Fantasy.  Instead, he's become doddering.	2001-07-06

There has been a need for a book like this -- one filled with Jewish words, both common and rare -- for many years.

But I have to warn you it may be better to glance at a story or two at your local bookstore before laying out the cash (it's relatively expensive compared to other similar titles).<br />Some stories are well done but the majority were simply either crude or not horrific.  The worst I read was &quot;Hey Fairy&quot; which had a monstrous and distasteful wish-fulfillment ending and the supernatural element made no sense -- obviously the author was not at all familiar with faerie lore or he would know the fey folk don't possess people.<br />So buy this at your own risk.  The editor's work with gay vampire stories was far far superior.	2001-01-04
