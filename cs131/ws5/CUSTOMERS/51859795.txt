Even scientists with good ethics have done this, perhaps proceeding from their mistaken faith in uniformity and gradualism. Fringe writers tend to be even more vicious, and even less informed about the content of Velikovsky's writings and character, relying on pseudoscientific drivel by certain celebrities best left nameless. <br /> <br />\\"Worlds In Collision\\" was published first of Velikovsky's books -- essays, and a couple of booklets preceded it -- yet it was the last product of a line of research which began with his study of Freud's \\"Moses and Monotheism\\". Had the publication been delayed, it is possible that \\"Ages In Chaos\\" would have been better received, and the catastrophic background referred to without being revealed until years had passed. It is perhaps the greatest scholarly \\"what if\\" of the 20th century. <br /> <br />Accordingly, I would recommend reading \\"Ages In Chaos\\" and the related volumes, as well as \\"Earth In Upheaval\\" and \\"Stargazers and Gravediggers\\" before reading \\"Worlds In Collision\\". Avoid synopses, and don't believe most of what you've read about the book or the author. The reason for the reading of the revised chronology first is to understand the framework better. Velikovsky himself made the mistake of accepting the supposed massive eruption of Thera as the source of the Atlantis legend, as well as its place in the conventional chronology (Edwin M. Schorr pointed this out in a letter to KRONOS years ago). <br /> <br />If you enjoyed Sitchin, Bauval, and certain other writers, you will not only enjoy \\"Worlds In Collision\\", you'll probably rid yourself of those others' works. <br /> <br />See also Velikovsky's other works (new and used), Ryan and Pitman's \\"Noah's Flood\\", Mary Settegast's \\"Plato Prehistorian\\", and Robert Schoch's \\"Voices of the Rocks\\".	2005-08-29
US	51859795	R1OGN2NTKJA1GZ	0804722854	410447861	The Mass-Extinction Debates: How Science Works in a Crisis	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Boom Boom, Out Went The Lights	This series of essays, edited by and partially written by William Glen, provide readers interested in the Alvarez theory a snapshot of the debate between uniformitarians and catastrophists, as it stood in 1994.  The authors include Digby McLaren, David Raup, and Victor Clube, and obviously includes essays by those either opposed to the concept of impact or by those who thought (or perhaps still think) that the impact at the K-T boundary did in fact take place, but didn't have any bearing on extinction. <br /> <br />This reviewer gives it four stars because, despite its quality, it is over ten years old.  The debate still simmers, but over the long run, the impact model for mass extinction will become the only game in town.  Saying, as some did or still do, that if all the volcanoes on Earth erupted simultaneously, sufficient iridium would have made it into the K-T boundary layer, used to be seen as a viable alternative.  As we see, even in 1994, it had already been debunked. <br /> <br />This doesn't even consider the fact that, if the Chicxulub impact had no effect on Earth's species, the fact that so many plants and animals went extinct essentially immediately was just a huge coincidence.  The alternative denial is to deny that mass extinction even took place.  Gradual extinction was still being trumpeted back in 1994 when this book was published.  It still can be seen here and there today, but is itself going extinct. <br /> <br />One reason this book is such an interesting read -- besides the frank expressions of the underlying assumptions on all sides -- is that it was published in the very year that all waited with breath abated for the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet fragments to impact on Jupiter.  I doubt that a book of this kind would have been possible after those impacts, because those scars on the Jovian surface buried most of the opposition to the significance of impact. <br /> <br />The various fallback positions of those who denied any role for impact (and insome rare cases, continue to deny it) are seen fully formed even in 1994.  The Deccan Traps, a large but otherwise unremarkable volcanic scar on the Earth, as well as other volcanic alibis for mass extinction, were already touted then, and had already been shown as fallacious in some of these essays. <br /> <br />It is only natural that impact is now seen as a uniformitarian phenomenon.  This was predictable and predicted simply as a consequence to the politics of science.  The late Eugene Shoemaker, codiscoverer of the SL-9 comets, is quoted in this book as supporting that idea.  While it is ironic that random catastrophes have been co-opted into a uniformitarian framework, some of the thinking behind that co-opting can be seen in the essays by David Raup and others.  The supposed periodicity of mass extinctions in the fossil record motivated Raup et al to look for various possible causes for showers of comets, a sort of Gouldian Punctuated Equilibria model based on causes from the skies.  Even in 1994, none of those had held up.  Since then, it has been purported that the Hubble Space Telescope has ruled out any stellar dark companion(s). <br /> <br />The Hubble hasn't shown the existence of the Oort Cloud, which is a necessity for most of the models claiming periodicity in the mass extinctions.  The Oort Cloud is also a necessary prop for the nebular hypothesis of solar system formation.  There's absolutely no evidence that it exists.  For those who don't know or seem to care, the existence of a hypothesis isn't grounds to posit the existence of evidence. <br /> <br />Clube's contribution is a good place to start for those interested in Velikovsky, for reasons which should be obvious to readers of both.  The book isn't a difficult read for most adults, although it may be a little dry in spots.  There is adequate amusement from mischievously selected quotes from scientists pro and con, as well as the slapping around of uniformitarian biases. <br /> <br />While this review is of a hardcover edition available to this reviewer, the book remains in print as a paperback.  Get it, read it, and enjoy.	2005-08-29

That's a metastasization of the post-Civil War efforts of the incompetent zealot Jubal Early.  This book falls within that genre. <br /> <br />The great mind of the Army of Northern Virginia general staff was Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.  In late April-early May 1863, months before Gettysburg, the battle plan for Chancellorsville was Jackson's.  Lee heard him out, asked, \\"how much would you leave me with\\", then approved it.  The ANV mauled the Army of the Potomac, despite being outnumbered.  Jackson wound up running out of daylight and while scouting for a night assault, was shot and seriously wounded by friendly fire. <br /> <br />After Jackson's fall, Robert E. Lee won but one major battle -- Cold Harbor, which was a mistake by Grant analogous to Lee's at Gettysburg, Burnside's at Fredericksburg, or John Bell Hood's entire history of command.  Had Jackson been at Gettysburg, I doubt the outcome would have been the same.  Regardless, Pickett's Charge would never have taken place, because Jackson would have talked him out of it. <br /> <br />The strategy of invading the northern states was a sound one, and the credit for that is Lee's. <br /> <br />Over the years we've all seen others assigned the blame for Lee's failures and mistakes.  Often Jeb Stuart is blamed for Lee's boneheaded idiocy at Gettysburg.  Usually it pertains to Stuart's failure to keep in contact with Lee during his reconnoiter around the Union rear.  In this book, Stuart's failure to prevail against Custer is offered.  It is foolish wishful thinking at best. <br /> <br />The fact is, the consensus view that Pickett's Charge was Lee's greatest error is correct, and this book is revisionist nonsense.  It was Lee who made that decision, and Lee who was first to recognize that the mistake was his own.  At least he should be taken at his word. <br /> <br />At Gettysburg, Lee had as good a numerical matchup against a Union adversary as any he was ever to have.  Onday one he launched an attack on the Union left which failed.  On day two, he attacked the Union right.  On day three, he launched a doomed frontal assault, across open ground, in broad daylight, against an adversary holding the high ground ahead and to either side, after telegraphing his move by an artillery barrage.  There isn't any reasonable conclusion to draw than that it was a stupid mistake, and furthermore, that this book is just another attempt to rationalize it away.	2005-07-15

During the medieval warming period the climate was warmer than it is today, leaving ruined medieval farmsteads at higher latitudes and altitudes than are possible today.  The Vikings headed for the Arctic, even settling there, and rediscovered the Americas. <br /> <br />The atmosphere isn't warming the Earth -- the Earth is orders of magnitude more massive than the atmosphere. <br /> <br />The oceans are not warming at depth. <br /> <br />The planet Mars has about as much atmospheric density as the Earth does at 40 MILES altitude and has never been warmed by greenhouse gases. <br /> <br />The atmosphere of Venus isn't made primarily of CO2.  Venus' density is slightly less than that of Earth's, same goes for its diameter.  CO2 won't be found at the hideously high pressures known to exist on the Venusian surface. <br /> <br />Surprise!  Ross Gelbspan didn't win a Pulitzer, as the DJ claims: <br /> <br />\\"'The Heat Is On' -- in which Gelbspan complains about how global warming critics distort the truth -- touted Gelbspan as a 'Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist' and Gelbspan has apparently done little in the intervening years to dissuade people of this falsehood despite being called on it on a number of occasions.\\" -- Brian Carnell \\"Ross Gelbspan's Pulitzer Prize\\" (Thursday, January 22, 2004) <br /> <br />What a surprise!

But not so worried that I don't make 'em.  This is my second try with this review, perhaps Amazon will publish it. <br /> <br />Like \\"Solving the Exodus Mystery\\" by Ted Stewart [097186800X], Henry could benefit from proofreading.  I found some of his choices to be a little confusing at first -- such as BCC for \\"B.C., Conventional\\" and BCS \\"B.C., Synchronized\\" -- and his footnotes are too terse.  There is no index. <br /> <br />That said, generally his writing style is readable and clear.  The organization of the book is excellent, linear, and not repetitive. <br /> <br />In brief, the Synchronized Chronology is a one-volume synopsis of Immanuel Velikovsky's \\"Ages In Chaos\\" series.  That was  published in three volumes (plus two unpublished works) over 26 years -- \\"Ages In Chaos\\", \\"Ramses II and His Time\\",  and \\"Peoples of the Sea\\" -- all five based on his \\"Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History\\" published in 1945.  Henry has produced a useful introduction and summary of the entire corpus, and doesn't try to hide this.  On p 220 he even refers to it as \\"the Synchronized Chronology offered by Velikovsky.\\"  Henry is respectful of David Rohl's and Peter James' alternate chronologies, each of which emerged from the failure of the Glasgow Chronology, which began as an attempt to revise V's reconstruction.  But Henry ultimately rejects Rohl and James. <br /> <br />I noticed some phrases and quotes direct from Velikovsky, such as \\"extravagant of labor\\" in reference to the clay Hittite strata at Gordion (p 186; found as a quote in \\"Ramses II and His Time\\", p 155) as well as a reference to MacQueen -- \\"Lydian 'seems to be Hittite'\\" -- with a footnote that can be sorted out using the book's bibliography.  Apparently Henry attributes it to MacQueen's \\"Babylon\\" which appears to be incorrect (perhaps nonexistent).  In this case, Henry gives the correct page number for MacQueen's first edition (59,in the note on 163) but the incorrect title (or perhaps one omitted title) in the bibliography. <br /> <br />In \\"Ramses II and His Time\\" Velikovsky cites this very same point from MacQueen's \\"The Hittites and Their Contemporaries in Asia Minor\\", p 59.  This citation applies to the first edition.  The allegedly expanded edition of MacQueen normally available to me has doesn't say this (p 59 being about something else), and refers elsewhere to \\"Arzawan\\" as MacQueen attempts to distance himself from the controversy about Hittite references to the Homeric Greeks, and possibly from Velikovsky's citation. <br /> <br />Henry's extensive use of Velikovsky is not plagiaristic or unscholarly.  In this book, Henry introduced me to the idea (from \\"Cambridge Ancient History\\") that the Amazons were actually Hittites, whereas Velikovsky suspected they were Cimmerians.  The identification of the Amazons isn't pertinent to the overall work in any case.  It appears that Henry became convinced of V's accuracy by checking his footnotes. <br /> <br />Henry makes the point that \\"a characteristic pottery decoration\\" found in the former territory of the Philistines \\"looks so much like East Greek 'bird bowls'... They are colonial Greek and have nothing to do with the true Philistines of the 11th century.\\"  As he doesn't seem to be aware of the unpublished volumes of \\"Ages In Chaos\\" (which are available electronically), this would be an example of his thorough understanding of the framework, rather than some kind of reflux of what went before. <br /> <br />Henry follows Velikovsky in rejecting the Sothic Cycle.  In his \\"Summary\\" chapter he explains its modern origin and notes that there's no evidence it was ever used in ancient Egypt.  Henry doesn't use any archaeoastronomy anywhere in this book (that I noticed), which is different than Rohl, who makes questionable use of a supposed eclipse record from Ugarit, and Stewart who follows Rohl on that.  The recent discovery that the Earth's rateof rotation has changed was made possible by an eclipse record from Babylon, and means that any ancient observations need to be used cautiously, or not at all. <br /> <br />He mentions in passing (p 242) an internet message he'd received regarding supposed incompatibility of the Kassite chronology with the Synchronized Chronology.  I've seen plenty of unsubstantiated (indeed, unsubstantiatable) claims of that kind over the years, in print and on the web.  Henry wisely saw through whatever the objection was, and showed his integrity by mentioning it.  Earlier (p 156) he points out the fallacious foundation of Ken Kitchen's alleged dating for Shoshenq I.  Kitchen's criticisms of alternate chronologies (y'know, those which don't agree with his) are quite energetic.  Peter James' defenses against Kitchen's assaults are often entertaining.  For a time, David Rohl had a sort of rude reference to Kitchen on the title headers of his website (which went down a while back).  Even as he disagrees, Henry treats all three with respect.  Throughout the book he deals with the ideas, not personalities. <br /> <br />This book makes an excellent introduction to Velikovsky's \\"Ages In Chaos\\" series (including the two unpublished volumes), and makes a good companion to Robert Compton's \\"Guide to Velikovsky\\".  Readers of Rohl's \\"Test of Time\\" a.k.a. \\"Pharaohs and Kings\\" or Peter James et al's \\"Centuries of Darkness\\" should enjoy this book.	2004-08-29
US	51859795	R3GSHIK481AUPK	097186800X	995558395	Solving the Exodus Mystery, Vol. 1: Discovery of the True Pharaohs of Joseph, Moses, and the Exodus	Books	2	28	43	N	N	<BR><BR>Been Done, Earlier, and Better<BR>	<BR>The first thing that overwhelmed me was Stewart's need for an editor.  He continually uses boldface in an amateurish way, and like the Elaine Bennis character on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, uses exclamation points throughout.  On pp 124 and 128 he uses the term &quot;brainchild&quot; (spelled two different ways) incorrectly -- the thinker isn't the brainchild, the idea is.  On p 139 he refers to &quot;mid-thirty's&quot; which should be &quot;mid-thirties&quot;.  He refers to the upcoming volume 2 as &quot;Solving the Exodus Problem&quot; (p 345) and refers to &quot;Table 21-I (p. 312)&quot; while the table is on p 314.  These may sound like nitpicking, but such things reduce an author's credibility, and could have been fixed by an editor.<BR><BR>Stewart draws far too much data and too many conclusions from the same few words of his sources (one of which is usually the Bible).  He is repetitious.  Most of his &quot;discoveries&quot; are reworded versions of his other &quot;discoveries&quot;.  Instead of stopping to state his &quot;discovery&quot; after his presentation of evidence (or, what he calls evidence), then moving to the next data and &quot;discovery&quot;, he summarizes all of them at the end of the chapter.  By that time this reader was dazed, and not in a good way.  An editor could have cleaned up this problem as well.<BR><BR>Stewart spends at least two chapters analyzing errors in everyone's use of the Sothic Cycle, invalidating all Sothic dating &quot;before and after&quot;, then in a tour de force non sequitur concludes that he has derived the correct Sothic dating for some 12th and 18th dynasty pharaohs.  He claims that parallel dynasties are the secret to building a correct chronology, then faults others (Velikovsky, Courville, Rohl) based on the kludge of parallel dynasties built by still others.  Stewart accepts without question that the 2nd intermediate period is lousy with parallel dynasties without appearing to realize that the synchronisms don't exist per se -- the chronology resulted from the fixed Sothic dates he spends two chapters debunking.  In other words, Stewart saddles on conventional source data which seems to support his position while rejecting or ignoring any that doesn't.<BR><BR>Sothic dating was ripped to shreds decades ago by Velikovsky.  Peter James also claims to have laid it low circa 1990.  The recent discovery that a Babylonian eclipse record from the late centuries BC would not have been visible from Babylon if our wonderful retrocalculations were correct should give pause to anyone trying to use eclipse records (or risings of Sirius) to verify a ballparked date for anything ancient.  Rohl's (and now Stewart's) use of an eclipse report to establish a 1012 BC date for the late 18th dynasty is invalid, which isn't surprising.  Their chronology for the 18th dynasty is hundreds of years too early.<BR><BR>Here's an example of one piece of data which blows apart Stewart's entire corpus:<BR><BR>&quot;According to the Book of Genesis Potiphar was 'an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard.'  In the register of the private names to the Ancient Records of Egypt by James Breasted, we find the name Ptahwer.  Ptahwer was at the service of the Pharaoh Amenemhet III of the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom.  According to an inscription of Ptahwer at Sarbut el-Khadem in Sinai dated in the forty-fifth year of Amenemhet III, his office was that of 'master of the double cabinet, chief of the treasury.' ...In the days of Amenemhet III there occurred in Egypt a famine enduring nine long years... Thus it seems that the Pharaoh in whose days was the seven years' famine was the successor of the Pharaoh in whose days began the rise of Joseph's career (if Yatu is Joseph).  Potiphar, who lived under Amenemhet III, probably lived also under his successor.  The inscription which deals with Ptahwer mentions a man whose name is transliterated by Breasted as Y-t-w.  Among the monuments of Amenemhet III's reign is one of the Storekeeper who was honored together with two other persons.&quot; -- Immanuel Velikovsky, &quot;Joseph and Potiphar&quot;<BR><BR>Despite the fact that Stewart is obviously familiar with Breasted, he identifies Amenemhet I as the pharaoh during Joseph's entry into Egypt, and Sesostris I as the pharaoh who elevated Joseph to Vizier of Egypt.  He claims that Amenemhet III is the pharaoh who tried to kill Moses.  None of these are supported by the Egyptian documents that he cites.  This suggests to this writer that Stewart decided that he had the right pharaoh and was heaven-bent-for-leather to cast aside everything that showed he is wrong.  He might, for example, reject this obvious synchronism from Velikovsky by pointing out that the Bible said the famine lasted exactly seven years, not nine, then run off on a tangent about other famines mentioned in old records.<BR><BR>One of Stewart's strengths is his humility.  In addition to frequent thanks to God and Jesus, he thanks an astronomer who helped him with the Sothic problem, thanks Velikovsky for identifying the Ipuwer papyrus as the ten plagues from the Egyptian point of view, and acknowledges a number of other scholars.  On the other hand, he refers to Lynn Rose as an &quot;historian not a scientist&quot; which is probably unintentionally derisive.<BR><BR>It's unfortunate I've run out of space, because the book isn't terrible, and there are ideas with which this writer agrees.  This book really could use an index, however.<BR><BR>Readers of Rohl's &quot;Test of Time&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Pharaohs and Kings&quot; or Peter James et al's &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot; should enjoy this book.  It is best read after one has read Velikovsky, and provided one keeps in mind that Stewart doesn't have a very good grasp of what's gone before, either in ancient Egypt or in the past couple centuries of the study of history.	2004-06-21

The index is pretty poor, although there certainly are a lot of entries in it.  There are a few genealogies in the back that are helpful in the first 100 pages or so.  There are a number of different ISBNs for this title, but it's all the same book.  It's hard to believe it has not previously received an Amazon review.<BR><BR>Grant begins with a one-chapter overview of Jewish traditions before the Romans, follows with two chapters on the Maccabaean revolt against Hellenic rule, and wraps all of it up in 49 pages.  As the scars of Greek occupation persist today in the anti-Jewish hate crimes perpetrated in the name of a fictional &quot;Palestinian people&quot;, which are in fact rooted in the intolerance of ancient Hellenism (most notoriously, the Roman emperor Hadrian).<BR><BR>Part II deals with the early Roman period.  In this we glimpse the early success of Pompey and the reason for his later popularity.  The Roman Senate was forced to deal with Caesar after he drove Pompey out of Italy, but continued to back Pompey financially through what we'd call back channels nowadays.  Pompey was called on to settle a dispute over supreme power in the stillborn independent state, wound up having to besiege Jerusalem, then desecrated the Temple, and set the tone for Roman-Jewish relations.<BR><BR>Though Rome already had a Jewish community, Pompey's battles introduced Jewish POWs in some quantity.  They wound up ransomed by the free Jews and the synagogues and entered the Roman world as citizens.  The dishonorable but articulate lawyer, Cicero, harped in an anti-Semitic way against these new Jewish citizens, in court no less, but supported Pompey against Caesar in the eventual civil war.<BR><BR>Grant's discussion in the rest of Part II of the last quasi-independent years of Roman Palesine are fascinating, bringing to life such often heard but little known names as Herod the Great and Pontius Pilate, as well as a number of other factions from that time of struggle.  I couldn't help but think of Monty Python's &quot;Life of Brian&quot; in which the factions were fighting each other for the privilege of being the ones who would defeat the Romans, rather than actually fighting the Romans.<BR><BR>The factions did however fight the Romans.  The Romans referred to the struggles as the Jewish Wars, and the Jews referred to them as the Roman Wars.  Josephus emerged from these as a pro-Roman Jewish writier, while Vespasian emerged as the eventual successor to Nero after the &quot;Year of Four Emperors&quot;.<BR><BR>Grant describes the sometimes crazy approach taken by various emperors, including Caligula, and the behind the scenes political and diplomatic activity that can be reconstructed from surviving writings.  The constant atrocities carried out against the Jews both by Rome and by the Greeks -- including the massacre of the Jewish community of Alexandria -- as well as the Apostle Paul's attempt to transform Judaism, are discussed.<BR><BR>Grant talks about the intrigues (as perceived by the Romans) between the thriving Jewish community in the Parthian empire and the much better treatment enjoyed under the much earlier Persian rule.  Cyrus the Great ended the Babylonian captivity and granted religious tolerance, something denied Jews under both Greek and Roman rule, either through official policy (Rome's abuse of the special tax on the Jews for example) or mob violence (desecration of synagogues, murder of priests and other Jews, destruction of written material).<BR><BR>Related titles:<BR><BR>-:- Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician by Anthony Everitt [0375507469]<BR>-:- Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Julius Caesar's Elite Tenth Legion and the Armies of Rome by Stephen Dando-Collins [0471095702 9]<BR>-:- Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third by Edward N.

It had obviously been rebound, but was in great shape.  When I opened it I found it dates from 1914!  And, stranger still, was recently in print.  Author R.A. Stewart Macalister (M.A., F.S.A., Professor of Celtic Archaeology, University College, Dublin) was interested in the Philistines from a Biblical perspective, which was almost all there was in 1914 regarding the Philistines.    The then-recent finds of the upper Euphrates basin and adjoining regions have helped shaped the view of the Philistines.  However, it's not all that different from 1914, as most of what we know of the Philistines originated in the Bible.  Without the Bible, the Philistines would be at best obscure.    This is still a useful book despite being seemingly out of date, and despite his reliance on the conventional pseudochronology (he was after all pre-Velikovsky).

The various ancient personages are discussed in multiple places and often in flashback, despite the apparent linear chronology of the book's organization.  However, I don't think most adults would be too bewildered by the hundreds of names, and that is perhaps why Cartledge used the approach he did.  It doesn't appear to be a consequence of having been assembled from an under-edited series of essays.<BR><BR>The index is not very comprehensive, although being able to look up the names of the many characters Cartledge mentions makes it indispensible.  But just try to find something about Spartan food, diet, broth!  As another reviewer said, it's better to use Google.<BR><BR>Cartledge's obvious admiration for the society of Sparta is also curious.  Sparta built a society based on gender separation, eugenics, forced homosexuality, forced child sexual abuse, constant war, enslavement of neighboring societies, and opposition to democracy.  Sparta assisted Persian aims by pursuing a course of Greek disunity in a transparent, and very long term, campaign to hold some of Greece in slavery, while eliminating outside threats to its system of slaveholding.  The policy culminated in Sparta's soliciting funds from Persia to build a competing navy capable of destroying Athens' \\"wood walls\\" and finally defeating Athens in the Pelopponnesian War.<BR><BR>Cartledge doesn't compare Spartan society with the Confederate States of America, which is obviously wise.  The CSA seceded over the issue of slavery (yeah, I can hear the \\"it was about sovereignty\\" rebel yell from here; forget that, read the various ordinances of secession, read about the laws the CSA passed, the old editorials, even Lee's letter about slavery of December 27, 1856), but didn't practice eugenics (no jokes please), forced homosexuality, forced child sexual abuse, and no more gender separation than any other society of that time.  Cartledge does cite an example of an alleged Confederate mother who (probably in profound grief at her loss) claimed to be grateful to God that she'd had sons to lose in the Lost Cause.  That may be a valid comparison, or may just be foolish.<BR><BR>Cartledge also seems to think that Sparta always acted in the best interests of all of Greece.  It's obvious from his own writing in this book that Sparta only wanted to keep doing what it was doing, and to eliminate outside threats to its own hideous political system, regardless of the consequences to the outsiders.  The Pelopponesian War began because Sparta didn't like the idea of Athens' helping them put down one of the numerous and continual slave revolts in what Sparta fancied as its property -- despite the fact that Sparta had asked Athens for the help.<BR><BR>Instead, he stresses the ways in which Sparta was like other city-states, and of the links it had with them, while claiming that the Spartan women were better off than women elsewhere in Greece.  I suppose he should include the women of the Perioci -- the disenfranchised trades- and crafts-men held in virtual slavery -- and the Messenian women -- Messene being one of the neighboring cities held in actual slavery.<BR><BR>One thing Cartledge should have avoided was the appendix on hunting, which constitutes one of the \\"amateur attempts at a sociology and sociology of modern hunting\\" he descries there.  He refers to hunting in the United States as 'hunting' (that is, in single quotes), and generally comes off as an arrogant and ignorant boor.  His differences with Roger Scruton would be better discussed in a scholarly setting.  This appendix is merely an anti-conservative diatribe, and is not in fact scholarly, and therefore it also doesn't belong in a book for general audiences.<BR><BR>[sidebar] In his own website, Roger Scruton mentions the \\"hate-site\\" from Clive Bates, who, as Adolf Hitler was, is an anti-smoking fanatic, as well as another admirer of Spartan society.  In Britain, Scruton is apparently widely hated and bashed by the so-called Far Left -- i.e., the single party state advocates -- for any faux reason they can immediately saddle on. [end of sidebar]<BR><BR>The book is worthwhile, but may take a while to get through, as it is a bit hard to follow.  The individual profiles are fairly engaging.  The DVD based on Cartledge' writings [\\"The Spartans\\"] makes a good introduction to the book.<BR><BR>	2004-04-24

One has to wonder whether the British press ever credibly criticizes anything that is dreamed up by a Briton.  Darwin has been enshrined as a secular deity, the Replacement hypothesis -- a racial superiority model -- has been embraced wholeheartedly, the Piltdown Hoax was immediately accepted and remained so for years, a British astronomer allegedly proved Einstein, but did not have definitive observations...<BR><BR>Ideas from Immanuel Velikovsky's &quot;Oedipus and Akhenaten&quot; are borrowed (ahem) by Phillips, but so is all the ridiculous &quot;Moses was Akhenaten&quot; nonsense that has swilled out of many a pen, along with &quot;the Exodus took place when Thera erupted&quot; fiction.  The author then adds that the tale of Atlantis really did originate in Egypt as Plato says, but refers to events taking place in the north.<BR><BR>There was no titantic eruption on Thera in the 17th, 16th, or 15th century BC.  As more rational scientists have noted, the caldera on Thera formed in prehistoric times, and probably not all at once.  Furthermore, the ruins were not buried under dozens of meters of volcanic crud, despite the fact that the allegedly much less energetic Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD covered the surrounding area with much more mud and ash.<BR><BR>Add to this the growing realization that the Linear B writing was still in use until the 2nd c BC (Latin loan words have been identified), and that Herodotus mentions no eruption or break in occupation at Thera (he discusses the island), while one (just one) later historian records an eruption circa 200 BC.<BR><BR>The fact that the conventional pseudochronology is used is not in the book's favor, either.  I have to think that this author is just cashing in on the wave of books featuring implausible revised antiquity.  Amarna arose because Akhenaten's grandfather reintroduced worship of the Aten, reviving it from the Old Kingdom.  By the time Akhenaten took the throne there was an ambitious priesthood, and a megalomaniac pharaoh.  Akhenaten did nothing but play at being a god while the empire he'd inherited crumbled.  Pleas for help preserved in the diplomatic archive found at Amarna were not answered.<BR><BR>On a positive note, the author does seem to give short shrift to one implausibility from the scholarly world -- that Nefertiti didn't die, but became the pharaoh Smenkhare.<BR><BR>	2004-02-26

As William Corliss wrote:<br /><br />&quot;On the day of the eclipse, Principe was bedevilled by clouds, and only 2 photographic plates were deemed marginally acceptable. At Sobral, 18 poor plates and 8 better plates were obtained. The problem was that the 18 poor plates yielded a deflection of starlight much smaller than predicted by Relativity, while the 8 better plates produced a much higher value. By adding the 2 plates from Principe to the mix, Eddington managed to come up with a number close to that required by the Theory of Relativity. It was not the clear-cut victory for Einstein that the textbooks proclaim. Yet the spin was on!&quot;['Science Frontiers', William R. Corliss, #126, Nov-Dec 1999]<br /><br />Steel is in the camp of Clube and Napier, and as he badmouthed Velikovsky at least once in print I'm reluctant to review this book or anything else he's written.  Still, as an introduction to the astronomical / astrological impact made on ancient societies, this book is probably a good choice.  Steel has been involved in the search for asteroids on collision courses with the Earth, but his interest in Clube and Napier seems to have resulted in a certain amount of being held at arm's length.  I noticed this in a David Morrison review of Steel's &quot;Rogue Asteroids&quot;.<br /><br />I have plenty of objections to using eclipses to date anything.  More to the point, everyone should have at least some reservations:<br /><br />&quot;At 8.45 on the morning of 15 April 136 BC, Babylon was plunged into darkness when the Moon passed in front of the Sun. An astrologer, who recorded the details in cuneiform characters on a clay tablet, wrote: &quot;At 24 degrees after sunrise-a solar eclipse. When it began on the southwest side, Venus, Mercury and the normal stars were visible. Jupiter and Mars, which were in their period of disappearance, became visible. The Sun threw off the shadow from southwest to northeast.&quot; If present-day astronomers use a computer to run the movements of the Earth, Moon and Sun backwards from their present positions, like a movie in reverse, they find something very odd. The total eclipse of 15 April 136 BC should not have been visible from Babylon at all.&quot; ['In the shadow of the Moon', New Scientist, 30 January 1999]<br /><br />The rather more expensive &quot;Historical Eclipses and Earths Rotation&quot; by F. Richard Stephenson makes a good subsequent read, and is the source of the information in the above quote.  Steel's book will make a decent introduction to the eclipse topic also, but remember to take it with a grain of salt.The Sun threw off the shadow from southwest to northeast.&quot; If present-day astronomers use a computer to run the movements of the Earth, Moon and Sun backwards from their present positions, like a movie in reverse, they find something very odd.

George Bernard Shaw listened to one of Butler's lectures and became convinced.  Robert Graves, author of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; was sufficiently intrigued that he later wrote a novel with Butler's claims as the basis.  Whether true or not, it's generally agreed that &quot;The Iliad&quot; had a different, earlier author.<BR><BR>However, the gyst of this book is that the story of Odysseus was borrowed by the Greeks from the British Isles, and that when restored to what is in Nyland's opinion their correct context, 1000 years is added to Scottish and Irish history.  In a way, Nyland follows a number of others before him, such as whoever claimed that someone named Brutus fled Troy and founded Britain, or Vergil who composed &quot;The Aeneid&quot; to create a mythic past for Rome, or even those who sinisterly claim that somehow the Europeans are the real Jews and the modern Jews imposters, or Martin Bernal who claims all kinds of things.<BR><BR>Following an historian named Edward Furlong, Nyland finds the supposed British roots to placenames and other words in the Odyssey.  He also links the ancient Ogam inscriptions of the Celts (a writing system that is quite pre-Roman, not &quot;early Christian&quot; as Nyland states, and found throughout western Europe at the very least) with Basque.  He assures us that the tale has been &quot;dreadfully distorted and added to&quot;, which is something I'd apply to Nyland's book.<BR><BR>It's still worth reading, because of the actual historical details he includes, and entertaining because of his unsubstantiated leaps.  Go ahead, give it a try.<BR><BR>Nyland used to have a website only.

This book is one of the best ever books on ancient navigation, and also on catastrophism.  Interdisciplinary and of wide scope, it's better and more focused than his earlier popular work, _Voices of the Rocks_ (ISBN: 0609603698).<BR><BR>Schoch isn't the first to raise the prospect of an ancient megalith building, seafaring civilization.  He's not the first to come around to a catastrophic way of looking at the past, in historic or prehistoric times.  But his presentation and credentials lend much higher credibility and a higher profile to such ideas.<BR><BR>From the work with proxy data in tree rings etc, to anthropological studies around the world, to exploration of the continental shelf, this scientist has produced what is easily the best of a problematical genre, as well as being a work of popular science.  So much debris has been penned regarding the origin of the Great Pyramid, alleged astrological links with ancient structures (Tiahuanaco, Stonehenge, Giza, etc), and precolumbian navigation (those works written from a political rather than scientific or linguistic perspective), this book by Schoch is a new light in an ancient sky.<BR><BR>As Schoch recounts, Homo Erectus was crossing miles of open sea 800,000 or more years ago.  But we're supposed to believe that crossing open sea was abandoned thereafter in the SW Pacific for at least 750,000 years, then abandoned again for at least another 47,000 years, and Australia was settled just twice during that nearly one million year period.<BR><BR>My reservations about this book involve Schoch's use of the conventional pseudochronology of the ancient Near East.  But had he been interested in anything else, his book wouldn't stand a chance.  As it is, the book's enemies will continue to forge links for their Marley-banshee chains.

There's no global warming going on, other than the results of our sole source of heat -- the Sun with its variable output.  There's no gradualist mechanism which can produce miles deep glaciers in areas where summers climb to 70 degrees, leave alone 80 or 90 degrees.  In order to produce ice of that depth, excessive heat in a short (months, weeks, days) timeframe is needed to create water vapor sufficient to cause such levels of precipitation.<br /><br />Photosynthesis isn't a necessity of life.  In fact, due to the greater complexity of plants at the cellular level, it's unlikely that plants existed before animals.  Chemical processes other than photosynthesis go on today, and its ridiculously unlikely (from a Darwinian, materialist, reductionist perspective) that it didn't go on in the past.<br /><br />Louis Frank et al have shown that small comets arriving round the clock delivered enough water to fill our seas to their current depth during the estimated lifetime of the Earth.  Considering that bombardments must have been more common at one time, there's no reason to believe that Earth's conditions don't change due to short term (though rare or unique) natural events.<br /><br />Considering that there's no evidence that sealevels were once much higher than they are now, and that the Antarctic ice is less than three million years old, there is simply no way for the Earth to have maintained any kind of conditions for very long periods.  Earth is not Mars, nor is it Venus.  After producing another monumental house of cards in _Rare Earth_, one would think that the authors would at least stick to the premise that Earth's conditions are unique.	2003-03-07

The counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations assumed there was, and concocted one out of thin air, in a failed attempt to extract more funding.  The myth of the grassy knoll shooter has persisted for nearly 40 years, perhaps most notoriously in the ridiculous movie \\"JFK\\".<BR><BR>One of the ironies of Oliver Stone's messterpiece was immediately apparent to me when I saw it in the theater.

Books	3	8	32	N	N	Good News and Bad News	Michael Shermer, the publisher of one of the (not-too-) skeptical magazines, coauthored this book on Holocaust denial that may be worth a look.<br /><br />For one thing, it contains the information that it was for the English language edition of a book by the notorious denier Robert Faurisson (called the \\"Pope of Revisionists\\"; revisionism means denial) that Noam Chomsky wrote the preface.<br /><br />The Israelis don't engage in an extermination campaign against Arabs -- in fact, it's quite the reverse. There is no denial in this book that the Nazis mass-murdered people other than Jews. Such a claim about the book is itself a good way down the road toward Holocaust denial, and so are lies about Israel.<br /><br />As noted in another review, there is plenty of Holocaust denial on the Internet. If you wish to study the enemy on their own turf, check out either the Stormfront website, or Radio Islam. The latter is operated by a naturalized Swedish citizen who lives in exile from Morocco for having participated in two coup attempts.<br /><br />Holocaust denial goes hand in hand with those who blame US policy for \\"causing\\" the September 11 mass murders. Find one of those on the web, you'll nearly invariably find the other.<br /><br />Predictably, Shermer takes the opportunity to equate Holocaust denial with the idea of Precolumbian voyages, UFOs, _Forbidden Archaeology_, etc, and probably at this point he'd include those who don't accept without reservation the fiction and lies about global warming. So, let's just say I have some reservations about this title.<br /><br />Related reading:<br /><br />-:- Interrogations by Miroslav Verner (0670030082)	2002-10-28

He was never prosecuted for war crimes (no doubt due in part to the obsequious behavior that went on in European countries eager to regain their colonial empires, including the interment of Jews in British prison camps on Cyprus), and wound up living in Egypt where he was active in his and many other Arabs' lifelong campaign to exterminate the Jews.  His and others' similar efforts no doubt contributed to the foundation of modern Israel.<BR><BR>Overall, this book traces the history of Islamicism, the political practice (which began with Mohammed by the way) of killing every non-Moslem in sight and trying to set up a totalitarian state run by a religious hierarchy.<BR><BR>Recommended reading:<BR><BR>-:- The Quest for the Red Prince by by Michael Bar-Zohar (1585747394)<BR><BR>	2002-10-28

On 306-307 there are some illustrations of the Arkalochori axe found on Crete.  The haft has two types of \\"crested\\" heads (one face one, one in profile) somewhat resembling what Robinson calls the \\"Mohican\\" glyph that is the most common symbol on the Phaistos Disk.  That (and a very weak second example) are all that has been found on Crete resembling the PD hieroglyphs in a century of excavation.<BR><BR>As Fell pointed out, the typeface (these characters were impressed on the clay using dyes, making the disk the oldest known example of a text printed with moveable type) is straight out of Anatolia.  That source is what led to his decipherment of it -- he began by assuming it was from the Anatolian group of tongues, and came up with a workable and plausible translation.<BR><BR>I'm encouraged that the author of this book mentioned Fell without dismissing him or disrespecting him, as a reviewer for _Archaeology_ once did -- suggesting that one of his books was a candidate for burning.  _Lost Languages_ is worth a read.<BR><BR>	2002-10-28

Luttwak's analysis of the Roman army structure illuminates how a single city managed to impose its own order on a substantial fraction of the world's population, stretching from northern England to the Persian Gulf at its greatest extent, while employing a fairly small army of 300,000 to 500,000 infantry, cavalry, and mariners.<BR><BR>In a rare display of historical trivia, one of the minor characters in the wonderfully dreadful Liz Taylor version of _Cleopatra_ remarked on how Caesar had arrived \\"with so few men\\".  Luttwak explains the strategic vision that made that possible.<BR><BR>The same strategy has been arrived at (or stumbled onto) by later powers, while others have staggered under too much militarization.  The USSR relied on ever-larger piles of weapons, huge standing armies, and proxy warfare outside its borders.  That played a role in its demise, as did its failure in Afghanistan.  Britain used a strategy similar to Rome's (and superior weapons) to conquer and rule a worldwide empire.  The US uses a hybrid strategy to contain its enemies, build reliable alliances, and protect its interests.  Superior weapons have also played a part in the US approach.<BR><BR>Rome on the other hand had to rely on discipline and tactics, because it didn't generally have superior  weaponry to bring to bear.

I'd recommend it with the proviso that Fagan goes along with the &quot;global warming&quot; and &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; myths, despite presenting nothing but evidence for the entirely natural causes for climate fluctuation.  For just one (rather glaring) example, sealevel hasn't increased measurably in the past 150 years (despite all the recent histrionics and hysterics), but during the medieval warming period oceans were so much higher that England's Norwich and Ely were both important seaports (Norwich was then on a fiord).  Unlike some better known former ports, they didn't lose access to the sea due to silting, they lost it due to declining ocean levels.  Perhaps Fagan didn't want to cause too much trouble for himself, or perhaps he's part of that crowd.<BR><BR>He doesn't seem to address an important anomaly, which is that the onset of the &quot;little ice age&quot; varies by centuries, depending on whom one asks.  The reason for this difference of opinion in my view grows from the mistaken belief that large scale cooling causes glaciation, which is obviously not true -- the hydrologic cycle falls to a new equilibrium during a cooling.  For the ocean levels to decline, more energy (to evaporate the water) must be made available through some mechanism, and I very much doubt that mechanism will ever be found in the inventory of gradualism.<BR><BR>	2002-01-24

That would be a salvage job for the ages, and a great way for a museum to add to its collection.  I do however wonder if that's really where the ship went down.  Some even dispute that the ship ever existed per se, or that it went down, or that it went down in that year, or that it had the sarcophagus onboard.<BR><BR>The author rejects the high age of the Great Sphinx that was proved by the water erosion -- a point on which most geologists (the overwhelming majority) who have studied the evidence agree.  His rejection is on the flimsiest basis, especially since the Sphinx itself is not aligned with the so called cardinal points while most stuff at Giza is -- but that the also predynastic temple near the Sphinx has the same alignment.  Verner insists that the consensus is that Khafre carved the Sphinx, but later writes &quot;(Khufu?)&quot; and nowhere that I saw mentions Stadelman's establishment that the Sphinx was probably carved by Khufu.<BR><BR>I read chunks of this book last night, and recommend it as a pretty good overview of the known pyramids, including those which barely survive (foundations only, or literary references with little else).

There's a book of interrogation transcripts taken from Nazis after the war.  It is not pleasant reading.  I do wonder, in this age of PC, whether the public school system actually teaches about the Holocaust and the stupidity of Holocaust deniers.<BR><BR>Dieter Wisliceny, one of Eichmann's lieutenants, put the number of Jews exterminated at 4,817,700, based on personal recollection and while looking at a table (not reproduced) showing the numbers from this or that country or part of a country.  He doesn't mention the Ukraine, where another 500,000 or more were killed by mobile SS units, or Germany, where his figure of 180,000 appears much too low.  He does recount that Eichmann told him that Polish Jewry were the powerhouse for world Jewry and were to be completely exterminated.  That amounts to over 3 million killed.<BR><BR>&quot;I am convinced that with the exception of the few thousands of Polish Jews found alive in concentration camps, every single Polish Jewish individual has been killed.&quot; -- Wisliceny (p 368)<BR><BR>Another interrogation (more like a conversation) between two other people has the disturbing scene in which they begin to laugh as they recount how bad the area near the killing rooms smelled, but how it got to the point where one could eat a sandwich in there.  That conversation ends with the man being interrogated saying that the only good thing that came out of the project was that a few million Jews were killed.<BR><BR>Dr. Robert Ley, a notorious and self-proclaimed anti-Semite wrote an open letter to the German people saying that the Jews and Germans had to make peace with one another, but he did so in such a slimy, unrepentant, ambivalent way that I got a little sick reading it.  That [characterization deleted] killed himself inhis cell rather than be tried for his criminal activities.<BR><BR>Other than the Holocaust, another subject somewhat illuminated by these transcripts is the conduct of the war, and the reasons behind some obvious tactical and strategic mistakes by Germany, most notably its failure to invade Britain and end the threat of a two front war.  Hitler and others were concerned that the British Navy was too strong for Germany to invade.  And yet, Germany opened up a second front before it was ready (if indeed it ever could have been) rather than prepare the UK invasion.<BR><BR>Keitel said that if the USSR could have been overcome by 1941 and forced to capitulate all would have been fine, and that he'd held that view at the outset.  He also noted that Germany had only six divisions on the eastern front after the division of Poland, and that continuous guerrila warfare was going on, along with a massive buildup of Soviet forces, and increasing territorial and other demands that Hitler couldn't accept.  Had the non-aggression pact not been signed, or Stalin's bluff ignored, the issue of a vulnerable eastern border wouldn't have arisen, and the overwhelming of western Europe including the UK could have gone forward.  The Bismarck drew off much of the British naval strength, and that would have been the time to launch the invasion.  Luckily for the world, Hitler didn't comprehend strategy, and actually didn't even comprehend tactics.<BR><BR>In short, this is highly recommended, but don't expect to be cheered up by it.  It's a necessity to know one's enemy, and the Nazis and their current day apologists (including commentators in Middle Eastern media, where the so-called &quot;myth of the Holocaust&quot; is commonly believed) and comrades in arms are ours.<BR><BR>	2001-11-02

Of course, when he said that, he was a resident of Los Angeles.<BR><BR>According to this author, desalination is no cheaper than delivery by floating bags.  Apparently he hasn't got up to date info from the eastern Mediterranean.  Desalination (many methods are available, as he notes) is the way of the future.<BR><BR>The biggest problem area in water distribution is the use of open canals in hot, dry areas.  Most significantly, Los Angeles gets its water supply that way, and Egypt is losing arable land every year in part because of a failure to arrest evaporation losses.<BR><BR>The Med-Dead project (to bring water from the Mediterranean into the Dead Sea, as a way to supply Jordan; instead, Jordan wants a canal from Aqaba, along the Saudi-Israeli border for political and military reasons) and the Med-Qattara project will probably never materialize for economic reasons.<BR><BR>The Aral Sea basin was devastated by Soviet land use and water use practices, making the contested valley along the Afghan border significant to the world at large.<BR><BR>The Kuwaitis and Iranians are building a way (Japanese contractor I believe) to move water from western Iran to oil-wealthy Kuwait, via a pipeline under the Persian Gulf.  The Turks intend to build an anchored pipeline from a hydro project to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (the Turkish enclave of Cyprus, an independent nation recognized only by Turkey).  If brought to fruition, each of these projects will have political and military significance.<BR><BR>The hysteria of the title is a bit much precisely because water doesn't go away; no matter how tainted, it can be filtered and reused.  The world is people, and people aren't short of water.  Agricultural irrigation uses something like tentimes as much water as other uses, but requires less treatment.  Obviously we need agriculture, and the other uses can be easily satisfied using current sources merely by cheap methods of conservation.<BR><BR>	2001-10-31

I've been rereading the LOTR here and there for the first time in years.  I had some unexpected emotional reactions to sections I well remembered, but in middle age they had a new impact on me.  I see now why science fiction was such a disappointment to me that I gave up reading it.  I no longer read fiction at all, but if all fiction were like this, odds are good that...<br />I still love the old red and black covers of the Ballantine paperback edition from thirty years ago, along with that huge poster of the same images, but would read these books if they had no covers and the spines had let go of all the pages.  These books are world famous and popular for good reason.  Be sure to read all these before the movies start to come out starting this Christmas, because the books can only be better.  I'm sure it will help to have some idea what is supposed to be going on in the movie.  And of course, buying it now lets you say truthfully, &quot;oh, in the book there was so much more,&quot; while acting as if you read them years before.<br />Check out &quot;The Elder Edda&quot;, one of the many medieval sources which contributed mythos to Tolkien's masterworks.  There's a fairly new edition and translation available in paperback.  Look up some of the dwarves' names and pretend to be surprised.  Not only are all of Bilbo's companions found there, Gandalf's name, as well as three otherwise unknown dwarves mentioned in &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, are found in the same passage of the Edda.<br />Also worth reading, from the perspective of mythos, is the Ring of the Nibelungs saga (Siegfried); Orlando Furioso (a renaissance era parody of the epic poem genre); Beowulf (if you must); and Plato (the Greek philosopher), the dialogues &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot; (the source of the Atlantis story).<br />Tolkien was no plagiarist, however; &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and the LOTR trilogy are not merely original works, they may be the reason geeks play dungeons and dragons, computer games like Tombraider, and dress up for the Society for Creative Anachronism, as well as write thousands of pages of sword and sorcery and other fantasy fiction.<br />Read these already, but no longer have your copies?

Keep in mind however that he is, if anything, a Cleo partisan. Sure, says Grant, Cleo's entire family were a bunch of incestuous, ruthless killers, but Cleo, she was a shining light of the ancient world. In other words, the factual content of the book and the writing style make this a worthwhile book to experience, but Grant's unfounded assertions that Cleo's character was impeccable and/or justified given her times are ridiculous and pointless. Perhaps his view is a consequence of growing up under a female figurehead monarch. Cleo was nothing but a Roman plaything, set on the throne by Rome, for Rome's convenience, and removed from that throne when she began to act against the interest of Rome. Period.<BR><BR>By contrast, the ancient rumors about Antony's adulteries and the like are for the most part given by Grant without disclaimer (the supposed surviving note from Antony to Octavian allegedly regarding Antony's marriage to his sister being an exception). Any such thing regarding Cleopatra is immediately dealt with by Grant's elaborate denials. Obviously the same supposed conspiracy of Cleo haters would have cooked up even more insidious lies about Antony, since Cleo was not a traitor (she was a Greek), nor was she militarily significant.<BR><BR>Spoiler: Antony and Cleopatra lose the war with Octavian.<BR><BR>Everyone must have some familiarity with the story of Cleopatra through the plays of Shakespeare and the various movies based on them. Many of the lesser known characters from Cleo's time are fleshed out in Grant's book. His account of the civil war between them is sufficiently detailed without being overlong. As I do with many works of history, I found many potential \\"what if\\" scenarios, including Antony's bungling attempt to conquer Parthia.<BR><BR>Ultimately, Antony lost Rome through his own long absence and lack of ability to think strategically, at least in comparison withOctavian's military subordinates such as Marcus Agrippa.<BR><BR>This is recommended in either format (audio 0788703528, ppbk 184212031X).<BR><BR>Also recommended: the BBC production \\"I, Claudius\\" is available on DVD.

This book is easy to understand and its premise easy to grasp and accept.  It is out of print, but generally used copies can be found using the usual online searches.  Check your local public and college libraries for copies as well.<br />There is no ancient account of the way the pyramids were built.  The story told to Herodotus during his visit 2500 years ago suggests that the Egyptian tour guides of that time were as full of flummery as tour guides are today, and unaware of their country's history.<br />The conventional view -- that individual stones were used -- might work if all four sides were under construction at the same time, but this requires ramps or scaffolding.  It is typical in such a model for a single ramp to wrap around.<br />The idea that the &quot;stones&quot; could be formed in situ is compelling on its own, but gains credence due to the difficulty of quarrying, smoothing, transporting, and placing full sized stones with such rapidity, particularly in the new, incredible, pseudo-historical claims by Zahi Hawass that there were no slaves in ancient Egypt, and that the stones of the Great Pyramid aren't nearly as numerous or as heavy as has been claimed.<br />The destruction of the mountain in Brazil which has been a hand-dug gold mine for forty or so years supports the credibility of Davidovits' idea -- that mountain has vanished and a huge pit opened under the old site, 40 pounds at a time, using ordinary digging tools and handmade ladders.<br />This book is highly recommended.  Read it instead of the attacks that have been made against it, against the author, and against favorable reviews.<br />-:- No, the pyramids weren't used to generate electricity during the Old Kingdom.<br />-:- No, the pyramids weren't built by extraterrestrials or Atlanteans.<br />-:- Yes, the pyramids were used as tombs, but were robbed centuries ago.<br />-:- Yes, the Biblical Israelites may have constructed pyramids, but those were Middle Kingdom in date, and located in the Fayyum (see Herodotus' discussion of those mud brick structures which have for the most part vanished).<br />Also recommended:<br />-:- Voices of the Rocks by Robert Schoch et al<br />-:- Serpent in the Sky by John Anthony West<br />-:- The Mysteries of the Sphinx (VHS)<br />-:- Plato Prehistorian by Mary Settegast<br />-:- Ages In Chaos by Immanuel Velikovsky<br />-:- The Secret of Crete by Hans Wunderlich (out of print)	2001-07-18

Doubts had been expressed that the GPS could remain accurate due to a relativistic effect known as &quot;frame dragging&quot;, but TVF concluded that, through a slightly too convenient coincidence, &quot;frame dragging&quot; didn't apply to this particular narrow case. It's clear that he understands conventional theories very well, and that's what made it possible for him to develop his Meta Model, the discussion of which comprises the first half of this book.<br />I can see how the Meta Model discussion would not get high marks, as it clearly didn't in at least one of the earlier reviews here. I read most of it, finally got bored, and skipped into the second half of the book (first edition ISBN 1556431554) which pertains to TVF's Exploding Planet Hypothesis.<br />When he wrote the first edition, the Alvarez theory was gaining momentum elsewhere in the sciences, as the position of the impact crater that ended the Cretaceous had been located at Chicxulub (the crater had been located circa 1960, but the Alvarez theory didn't come around until 1980 -- see &quot;Night Comes to the Cretaceous&quot; by James Lawrence Powell, ppback 0156007037 hardcover 0716731177).<br />TVF didn't mention any of that, spending time instead on the &quot;Face on Mars&quot;. At that time (early 1990s) the newest surface photos from Martian orbit were still those of Viking from the 1970s. The &quot;Face&quot; did exist, and it was an artifact -- but it existed only in those photos, and was only an artifact of the lower resolution of the Viking cameras, as opposed to that of the recent (late 1990s) orbiter. I don't see how any reasonable person can look at the higher res photos (as opposed to both the Viking photos and the low res photos from the new orbiter, which can mimic the resolution of Viking) and conclude that the &quot;Face&quot; is artificial. This devotion to a completelydiscredited idea is not to TVF's credit, and as someone who respects his intellect and many of his ideas, I wish he'd knock it off.<br />The best part of either edition is the discussion of TVF's Exploding Planet Hypothesis (EPH). He uses the model to explain things like the tipped axis of Uranus, disturbed moon system of Neptune, retrograde rotation of Venus, Earth-crossing objects, and various other things which have made thoughtful people wonder for a very long time. In the original edition the EPH was about 3.2 million years ago.<br />This new edition extends the EPH by adding an earlier exploding planet dated to 65 million years ago, in order to provide a source for the object which crashed into the Earth and ended the dominion of the dinosaurs. TVF's extension seems a bit ad hoc, but once a single unexplained planetary explosion has been posited, additional ones shouldn't be considered surprising or forbidden. On the other hand, TVF had already questioned the (also ad hoc) Oort Cloud idea, and that's the leading competitor (and dominant paradigm) for a source of the Chicxulub object. Since TVF is devoted to building a single comprehensive model to explain oddball characteristics of various solar system objects to replace the dozens of (also ad hoc) unique explanations.<br />[see &quot;Shoemaker by Levy&quot; ISBN 0691002258 for some brief comments quoted from Shoemaker regarding the role played by Jupiter in sweeping the Solar System of transitory debris -- TVF needs multiple exploding planets because such debris would either be kicked out of the system or bent into untroubling orbits within ten million years, mostly due to the presence of Jupiter]<br />TVF's discussion of the origin of Earth's own Moon is a great reason to buy this book, and a great place to begin reading it for those who are like me, and enjoy picking at a book here and there. It's also a discussion I'd like to criticize a little. TVF discusses the four basic models of lunar formation, thenpicks them off one by one, as he offers his own model (fission from Earth due to overspin). The problem with his critique of the capture model is that his arguments apply also to his overspin model, and there's nothing he can do about it. Furthermore, the early presence of water on the Earth (a discovery that I think antedates this new edition of &quot;Dark Matter&quot;) reduces the likelihood that the Moon was born of fission from Earth, either due to TVF's model or the more conventional impact model which is the dominant one of the five presented.<br />Despite the catastrophic character of an exploding planet, TVF's model is really quite uniformitarian, and for those who object to catastrophism on a priori grounds, this book and his EPH should provide a great introduction to the topic that fascinates one's friends and neighbors without letting on to anyone that you're secretly hoping to join the winning side. :^)	2001-06-16

His basic idea is that the so-called Minoan palaces were actually mausoleums, not dissimilar to saying that, like the Egyptians, Etruscans, and other ancient peoples, the Minoans put a great emphasis on the afterlife and their after death dwellings, and didn't leave behind well-preserved homes and the like.<br />Wunderlich attributes the destruction of the palaces to graverobbing, and notes that at Knossos the bathtub-shaped sarcophagi were identified by Evans et al as bathtubs.  Wunderlich sees the entire Knossos complex for what it apparently was -- a place for the embalming and storage of the dead nobility.  That the internal architecture of some Etruscan tombs is identical with Minoan tombs which were made by a culture supposedly long gone nearly a thousand years earlier is pointed out by Wunderlich.  He is however mystified by the similarity.<br />In 1978 Barry Fell published translations of Etruscan, showing that it belonged to the Anatolian group of languages, including Minoan which is expressed in Linear A.  Likewise, he noted the elements of the much later Petrachian sonnet in a surviving pre-Roman Etruscan inscription.<br />Although Immanuel Velikovsky must have been unaware of these two developments, the elimination of the phony &quot;dark age&quot; of Greece in his reconstruction of history is consistent with and supported by both.  It's interesting that in &quot;Ramses II and His Time&quot; (p 90, ISBN 1568490240) Velikovsky suggested that the &quot;Hittite&quot; library preserved an extensive library of Etruscan, since the misdating of the archive will have prevented such an identification.<br />&quot;Removing the historical scene to where it belongs, namely, to the seventh and sixth centuries before the present era, we wonder which of these languages is Chaldean, which Phrygian, which Lydian, which Median, which perchance Etruscan, spoken by a people whocame to Italy from Asia Minor... 'Hittite' was the language most commonly used during the Empire period.  Modern scholarship found that Lydian 'seems to be Hittite' --  the Lydian and the 'Hittite' kingdoms were contemporary, and used the same language.

The thing that sets it apart is the fact that Barry Fell had a mastery of ancient languages and epigraphy that may never have been bettered. His legacy will endure long after those who slandered and libeled him are classified alongside those ninnies who claim the Moon landings were hoaxed.<br />A few corrections to some misconceptions, some of which are found in other reviews of this title:<br />The Mystery Hill megalithic structures in Vermont were NOT built by colonial farmers. A colonial era family did once live on the site, but the major structures already existed when those folks arrived. The serious study of the site began years ago, and has entered the hallowed halls of academia. The site was constructed thousands of years ago, long before the freakin' Pilgrims. There's a nice website, the URL for which I'd include, but that's not permitted in reviews. Anyone who has visited the Mystery Hill site (now billed as &quot;America's Stonehenge&quot;) would be able to see how foolish and simpleminded it was to suggest a colonial origin -- the entire hilltop is covered by rows of stones laid out not as orderly pastures or pens, but in a way that is not unlike Glastonbury tor and other mazelike &quot;Old World&quot; sites.<br />The Vikings did reach the Americas. There's an unequivocally Viking site on Newfoundland that has been known and excavated for over 30 years. Even before that was identified, the Newport Round Tower was shown to be Viking in origin, although there remains plenty of denial of this fact. Verazzano saw the tower, and sent a landing party ashore to investigate the area, during his mapping expedition which took place long before the first governor of Rhode Island was born, making it difficult for the latter character to have built the Tower. An excavation to prove a colonial origin did take place, but not surprisingly the conclusions fitthe original assumptions.<br />The Americas have a large number of existing foreign inscriptions predating Columbus, and other well documented examples formerly existed but have been destroyed by development, vandalism, and the march of time. There are those who deny the existence of these, but such folks have no credibility. Fell didn't go beyond his data, in fact he spent quite a lot of time examining and exposing as hoaxes a number of supposed ancient inscriptions.<br />Another foolish idea is that a ship could have been wrecked, and seeds, artifacts, and other traces of human activity could float across the Atlantic or Pacific, without a crew, and recovered on the shore by Native Americans. But a fully crewed ship could not have crossed. This is despite the fact that such claims originate with landlubbers, and wrecked ships go right to the bottom.<br />Contrary to what &quot;Please don't believe this book&quot; wrote August 29, 1999, Barry Fell didn't &quot;claim that scientists are just trying to cover up the truth&quot;. This is just the most childish slander that I've seen in these reviews. The bias against any contact before Columbus arose late in the 19th century and by the early decades of the 20th century was a religion. When the first Clovis artifacts were found, the dating was attacked because the religion said that no one had lived in the Americas prior to about 1000 BC. After Clovis prevailed, the religion became &quot;Clovis First and Only&quot;. Tom Dillehay has spent about twenty years being ridiculed and attacked for finding that PreClovis site in South America, far from the supposed landbridge ingress of all the ancestors of Native Americans. Although there are some trying to dig in their heels and defend CFAO, it is essentially dead.<br />One has to wonder why the irrational devotion to such a ridiculous idea as isolation has endured regarding human occupation of the Americas, Japan, and Australia, among other places. In the case of the Americas, PreColumbian contact would mean that various claims on the land were not the first. As ridiculous as that seems, if a Roman wreck were identified, say, off the coast of Brazil, that could mean that Italy has a claim that supercedes that of Portugal. Such an event has occurred, and the underwater archaeologist trying to study it was kicked off the site by the Brazilian government.<br />Barry Fell's work, particularly that found in ESOP, was and remains revolutionary. The Epigraphic Society has a website, and James Trimm maintains a mail list on epigraphy with an interest in ancient navigators.<br />In 1978 Barry Fell published translations of Etruscan, showing that it belonged to the Anatolian group of languages, including Minoan which is expressed in Linear A. Likewise, he noted the elements of the much later Petrachian sonnet in a surviving pre-Roman Etruscan inscription. That the internal architecture of some Etruscan tombs is identical with Minoan tombs which were made by a culture supposedly long gone nearly a thousand years earlier was pointed out by another heretical scholar, Hans Wunderlich, in his &quot;The Secret of Crete&quot; (ISBN 0026316005 or 0285621645).<br />Although Immanuel Velikovsky must have been unaware of these two developments, the elimination of the phony &quot;dark age&quot; of Greece in his reconstruction of history is consistent with and supported by both. It's interesting that in &quot;Ramses II and His Time&quot; (p 90, ISBN 1568490240) Velikovsky suggested that the &quot;Hittite&quot; library preserved an extensive library of Etruscan, since the misdating of the archive will have prevented such an identification.<br />&quot;Removing the historical scene to where it belongs, namely, to the seventh and sixth centuries before the present era, we wonder which of these languages is Chaldean, which Phrygian, which Lydian, which Median, which perchance Etruscan, spoken by a people who came to Italy from Asia Minor...

This book reveals that Past Lives Therapy differs from traditional therapies because of how far back it goes. Without the use of hypnosis, and without requiring the patient's belief in reincarnation, Dr. Netherton probes the unconscious mind and unleashes a flood of traumatic events that go back beyond childhood, beyond the prenatal and birth periods, and into a past life.&quot; -- from the dustjacket<br />Most past lives therapists and other past lives researchers rely on hypnosis. Morris Netherton doesn't, and AFAIK he doesn't particularly approve of the use of hypnosis in past lives therapy. His book remains my favorite, but it is not in print. Any used book search engine will turn up multiple copies of the book however. That said, some of the books are not about past life recall per se.<br />In 1984 I spoke with Netherton in person regarding his book, and at that time he'd indicated that second book was in the offing. This second title never materialized. I have a feeling that despite its journey from hardcover (that's the ISBN given above, I no longer have my paperback version) to paperback, the first book wasn't that great a seller, and his publisher decided it would lose money in an environment where a dozen or more titles on the same subject were available or soon to be.<br />The AAPL, an organization founded by Dr. Netherton, has a website that indicates the impending publication of a series of four new books, possibly more suitable for therapists.<br />Regardless, this book is highly recommended, and there should be little trouble finding a used copy.	2001-03-27

In the land it became day.'  This does not equate Saturn with the 'sun on the horizon.'  It means that the coming forth of Saturn inaugurated the archaic day, which began at sunset.

The Pyramid of Cuicuilco rises up out of a weird landscape of darkly stony aspect.  At one time the volcanoes Ajusco and Xitli (perhaps only the latter) erupted.  The god within the pyramid was apparently remiss in diverting the glowing flood of lava that flowed about the pyramid, for half the structure was drowned in bubbling muck.  The archaeologists investigating this phenomenon called on colleagues from another faculty, the geologists, for help.  How old is the lava, they inquired.  The geologists, not realizing that their answer was knocking a world picture awry, answered: &quot;Eight thousand years.&quot; ...Yet late research is more inclined to consider it false.''	2001-02-16

I'm not sure I'd spend $100 on the audiotape version of this, but if its unabridged I'm sure it is worth listening to.  Spoto's excellent analysis on her death includes interviews with surviving people involved in the investigation, reading the autopsy reports, and evidentlyconsultations with doctors.  It's nice to see a factual account of her death at last, and I say that as someone who is not a fan of the Kennedy men and their sexual misconduct.

Schwaller de Lubicz' prolific work on the discerned symbolism of the ancient Egyptians.  Those interested in learning about SdL's interpretation would find this to be a good introduction, and will also find that many of SdL's titles are back in print, though a little pricey.  I have no need to learn any more about what may have been the intent of people attempting to apply magical thinking to the physical world, whether those people are long dead or my contemporaries.<br />The real value of this book is in a single idea from SdL's work, which is the realization that the Great Sphinx at Giza was heavily eroded by water (pp 177-179).  Geologists who oppose the idea that rain caused this erosion are few in number, and their motives are suspect since they'd previously not noticed or not pointed out in public the obvious fact of water erosion.  Such geologists are now limited to a slow retreat, attempting to accept water erosion without accepting greater antiquity, and the way they do this is by dreaming up new ways water erosion can do its work with great rapidity in an arid environment with essentially no rain.<br />One of the revolting aspects of the debate has been that the core argument gets attacked not on any lack of merit, but through damning by association.  Robert Schoch doesn't attribute the Sphinx to Atlantis.  Even though John Anthony West suggests such a link, the main point of disagreement between Schoch and West is that Schoch's estimate of the Sphinx' age is much lower than West's.  Both put the Sphinx origin in what is known as Predynastic times.<br />West does a good job showing the (two) roots of the various conventional beliefs about the Sphinx, and shows the ancient documentary evidence which supports a pre-Khafre Sphinx.  While Robert Schoch's &quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot; is a better choice, one has to read Schoch's articles (KMT, etc) to get the specifics of his views about the water erosion in any detail.  West's book is a better choice for that particular narrow focus.  Those with an occult or fringe interest will find that West's book is also a better choice than titles by Hancock, Bauval, Gadalla, and Sitchin.	2001-01-22

It's yet another attempt to have catastrophism without the mess, to show that catastrophes happen, but we're all nice and safe.<br />The title warrants three stars for its much more conventional and interesting discussion of the Cities of Cibola, which occupies the author for the first half of the book.

There's a crying need for a reprint edition of this odd, probably self-published work that was the author's avocation.  Like James, Rohl, Sieff, Liel, and Velikovsky, Courville concluded that the conventional pseudochronology of Egypt is way off.  He then proceeded to build a mostly implausible edifice that reminds me of Liel's, without of course claiming that the two are by any stretch identical.<br />It is of interest that in footnote Courville agrees that Velikovsky's identification of the Pharaoh of the Exodus could very well be correct, without abandoning the structure inherent in &quot;The Exodus Problem&quot;.<br />These volumes are worth a look, even if you can only find them in the library -- probably a religious college library at that -- for the maps, diagrams, and timelines.  It is clear that Courville put years of toil into this, perhaps his best known work, and a will-of-the-wisp rare book that, though cheap, few can claim to own.	2001-01-21

Even scientists with good ethics have done this, perhaps proceeding from their mistaken faith in uniformity and gradualism.  Fringe writers tend to be even more vicious, and even less informed about the content of Velikovsky's writings and character, relying on pseudoscientific drivel by certain celebrities best left nameless.<br />&quot;Worlds In Collision&quot; was published first of Velikovsky's books -- essays, and a couple of booklets preceded it -- yet it was the last product of a line of research which began with his study of Freud's &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot;.  Had the publication been delayed, it is possible that &quot;Ages In Chaos&quot; would have been better received, and the catastrophic background referred to without being revealed until years had passed.  It is perhaps the greatest scholarly &quot;what if&quot; of the 20th century.<br />Accordingly, I would recommend reading &quot;Ages In Chaos&quot; and the related volumes, as well as &quot;Earth In Upheaval&quot; and &quot;Stargazers and Gravediggers&quot; before reading &quot;Worlds In Collision&quot;.  Avoid synopses, and don't believe most of what you've read about the book or the author.  The reason for the reading of the revised chronology first is to understand the framework better.  Velikovsky himself made the mistake of accepting the supposed massive eruption of Thera as the source of the Atlantis legend, as well as its place in the conventional chronology (Edwin M. Schorr pointed this out in a letter to KRONOS years ago).<br />If you enjoyed Sitchin, Bauval, and certain other writers, you will not only enjoy &quot;Worlds In Collision&quot;, you'll probably rid yourself of those others' works.<br />See also Velikovsky's other works (new and used), Ryan and Pitman's &quot;Noah's Flood&quot;, Mary Settegast's &quot;Plato Prehistorian&quot;, and Robert Schoch's &quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot;.	2000-12-29

This book suffers from the author's reliance on the conventional pseudochronology, but it is worth exploring, particularly for students of the Bible.<br />A lot of rubbish has been written about the Bible, both pro and con, but ultimately it is the only thing that resembles a coherent and continuous history that can be found until Greek times.  Like the Greeks, the Hebrews mingled their faith with then-current events.  Unlike the Greek accounts, the Hebrews' is rejected, probably in large part due to anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and hostility toward Christianity.<br />The Philistines remain enigmatic, and while they seem to have thrived, most of what we know still comes from the Old Testament.  Bierling attempts to gather together everything that is known about the area in which the Philistines are said to have lived.  Since they cease to appear as a distinct people sometime during the period of the Biblical kings, and since their very existence is only known from the Biblical account, interpretations of new data which suggest otherwise merely support the need for chronological revision and a retirement of hostility toward the historical content of the Bible.<br />See also Immanuel Velikovsky's (new and used) &quot;Ages In Chaos&quot;, &quot;Ramses II and His Time&quot;, &quot;Peoples of the Sea&quot;, and &quot;Worlds In Collision&quot;, as well as David Rohl's &quot;Pharaohs and Kings&quot;, Peter James' &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot;, Ryan and Pitman's &quot;Noah's Flood&quot;, and &quot;The End of the Bronze Age&quot; by Robert Drews.	2000-12-29

The crustal displacement idea originated with Charles Hapgood, author of &quot;Path of the Pole&quot; and &quot;Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings&quot;.  It remains invalid, but the Flem-Aths attribute it to a supposed overburden of ice at the poles.  I may have missed something, but it would appear that the periodicity of the supposed shift would be determined by whether the ice could accumulate on land at both poles.  This would obviously be a rare event, given the large amount of the Earth's surface that is covered with water.<br />The Flem-Aths attempt to make what is at its heart a catastrophic event into another uniformitarian fantasy.  It is clear that they worked hard at this, but in that area the book is a failure.  The book also fails to convince that Atlantis was located in Antarctica.  This idea is basically ridiculous, although it probably drove the sales.  What is interesting is the various pieces of evidence showing that Antarctica has been iced over for less than 3 million years, rather than the 50 million or so formerly claimed by Lyell's followers.<br />Another mark against the Flem-Aths is their devotion to the idea that humans cause global warming.  This is a failing found in other fringe researchers such as Art Bell, Whitney Strieber, Linda Moulton Howe, as well as alleged scientists operating on grants from governments around the world.<br />Hapgood's claim that medieval maps -- there are no surviving ancient maps -- show Antarctica ice free is addressed by Robert Schoch (&quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot;, pp 102-106).  The best that can be expected from such maps is that they show Antarctica ice free much more recently than 12,000 years ago, an idea that none of these researchers would accept.  There are runic writing systems found in Europe's caves and going back much further than this, and they remain mysterious and unread.  To believe that 12,000 year old maps have been preserved through faithful transcriptions is just beyond credibility.<br />This book is still worthwhile buying and reading for what it can inspire regarding a possible human presence in Antarctica and its submerged continental shelf, and the possible role it played in the peopling of the Americas.<br />See &quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot; by Robert Schoch, &quot;Plato Prehistorian&quot; by Mary Settegast, &quot;The Ancient Mariners&quot; by Lionel Casson, &quot;Noah's Flood&quot; by Walter C.

Catastrophists often rely on bits and pieces from this book, perhaps indirectly, but nowhere else can they all be found, except perhaps for William Corliss' catalogs and sourcebooks.<br />The only thing that has happened since &quot;Earth In Upheaval&quot; was published in 1955 is that even more evidence has emerged along with even more outlandish rationalizations and apologia for uniform &quot;explanations&quot;.  While this 19th century delusional system perishes, its grip on power has slipped away.  Catastrophism triumphs everywhere, even in the consideration of celestial disasters in historical times.<br />In 1960 the Chicxulub crater was discovered by PEMEX.  In 1970 someone first suggested that the dinosaurs went extinct due to an impact.  In 1972 impact was shown to be the dominant force on the lunar surface.  In 1980 the Alvarez team suggested it again, supporting their view with the iridium found at the K-T boundary layer.  Others found similar iridium in other boundary layers.  By 1990 the Chicxulub crater finally came to the attention of the impact theorists.  Impact wasn't the fully accepted consensus until the 1994 impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9's fragments into Jupiter.<br />The text has the same ease and command of Velikovsky's other books, and I found it to be a pleasure to read 20 plus years ago.  I highly recommend it, particularly for those considering other books.  There is still a great deal of ill-temper, hostility, and ignorance regarding Velikovsky's works, and these often take the form of a single dismissive sentence or paragraph.

It portrays the face of Dionysus, but the pattern around his central portrait is best described as psychedelic (p 58).  So, there really is nothing new under the Sun - this is the first century equivalent of a black light poster of op-art.  Followers of Dionysus liked to warm up with unmingled wine and allegedly some mildly stimulating herbs.  This cult goes back, apparently, to the heyday of Catal Huyuk, as there are representations of Dionysus-like and related characters.  Catal Huyuk and its short-lived successor ceased to be 7500 years ago.<br />Magdelanian art comes from the last Ice Age.

I figure that people by and large were not living in caves and carving naughty bits on the wall, but rather that the same kinds of people who pursue artistic fields today were off by themselves.  Most of the cave art found in books concerns animals and supposed hunting magic rituals, so it's probably a public service that Miles and Norwich have included these surpressed works.<br />See also &quot;Eros In Pompeii&quot; by Michael Grant with photography by Antonia Mulas and &quot;A Book of Love from the Ancient Mediterranean: The Sweetness of Honey and the Sting of Bees&quot; by Michelle Lovric and Nikiforos Doxiadis Mardas.	2000-12-18

Barry Fell studied the medieval sources which preserve the many kinds of Ogham writing, which is a sort of line writing on either side of a baseline, and concluded that its basis in groups of five or less indicated an origin in a sort of finger spelling.  This presupposes the use of an alphabet.  We no longer use Ogham, and the alphabet we use today isn't like this runic system.  The daunting part of this tidbit is that alphabetic writing must be at least 12,000 years old, nearly three times as old as the known systems of hieroglyphics and cuneiform, and probably 35,000 years old, with no good reason to believe that it isn't much older than that.<br />Naturally I wanted to check the Rudgley book to see if Settegast is mentioned.  She isn't.  Rudgley covers some of the same ground, but his entire book pertains to the literacy of supposedly preliterate cultures.<br />The Upper Paleolithic character set suggests that some form of writing, perhaps even alphabetic writing, has been part of human activity for over 12,000 years.  This isn't to say that we'll someday find a library, but at least if we do we won't be caught unawares.  There's a discussion of Linear A, and (page 75) there's a quote from Allan Forbes and Thomas Crowder, source of the Magdalenian character set reproduced by Mary Settegast.<br />Rudgley discusses that the conventional view that writing is relatively recent is really an outgrowth of the idea of progress, by which is meant that humans were stupid primitive cave people for hundreds of thousands of years after they descended from the trees until, in short order, they domesticated animals, perfected irrigation and plant breeding, built the first cities, and invented writing.<br />Rudgley makes the point (pp 67-68) that Vinca signs were first believed to be derivative of earlier Sumerian, then were derided as random marks after their actual age was discovered.  Considering that the Sumerians' best known cities as well as the Tigris and Euphrates bore names that were pre-Sumerian, it shouldn't come as any surprise that someone accomplished something long before they entered the region.<br />As Settegast points out, sealevel was hundreds of feet lower, so &quot;ice age&quot; settlements and perhaps thousands of years of cultural developments have long since vanished.  It used to be thought that writing originated in three or four places and diffused outward into the world.  Its invention was too recent to have any impact on the Americas, or so it was thought, because the Americas were completely isolated prior to that.<br />Perhaps most interesting (pp 247-260) is Rudgley's discussion of the dates of artifacts from Japan, a situation which has relevance in the current debate over Clovis-first-and-only.<br />Also of interest is &quot;The Origin of Language&quot; by Merritt Ruhlen	2000-12-18

Based on his booklet &quot;Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History&quot;, Ages in Chaos preceded Oedipus and Akhenaten, Ramses II and His Time, People of the Sea, and the unpublished volumes Dark Age of Greece and The Assyrian Conquest (the first one and the last two are available online).<br />This first volume spans the period from the Exodus to Akhenaten.  Biblical scholars and evangelists appear for the most part to be unfamiliar with it.  The connections Velikovsky shows between Biblical events and Near Eastern history are at other times attacked or derided by believers, perhaps because they've been burned by false claims.  Perhaps this attitude stems from a misplaced trust in blind belief.<br />Velikovsky's attention to detail and sheer erudition continue to awe and inspire.  Lesser works have come and gone before and after Ages in Chaos.  None have built such a convincing case.  Those interested in building some heretical chronology of their own would do well to study Velikovsky's works if only to save themselves time.<br />His studies of the roots of various beliefs by other historians, including those of ancient times, are fascinating, and his finding synchronisms between the Old Testament and the ancient history of surrounding people and places are monumental and revolutionary.  Had he published Ages in Chaos before Worlds in Collision, his impact might have been greater.  Those with longtime familiarity with his chronology are certain that he will have greater impact in the future, if not directly then indirectly.<br />The existing consensus pseudochronology grew out of 19th century (and earlier) nonsense beliefs such as freemasonry, but remains the consensus through rejection of commonplace scientific dating techniques.  As it loses credibility with each passing year, one wonders why so muchvenom has been expended against Velikovsky's chronology -- particularly those who have actually read the works.<br />See also Velikovsky's other works (new and used), David Rohl's &quot;Pharaohs and Kings&quot;, Peter James' &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot;, Ryan and Pitman's &quot;Noah's Flood&quot;, Mary Settegast's &quot;Plato Prehistorian&quot;, and Robert Schoch's &quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot;.	2000-12-18

As Martin Sieff has pointed out, the Velikovsky model is the only one that works.  All of these scholars recognize that the conventional pseudochronology is untenable.  James hasn't any use for Rohl's timeline or for Kenneth Kitchens; Rohl has none for Kitchens; neither James nor Rohl seem to mention each other by name very often in public forums.  Rohl has had more success in his publishing endeavors, possibly because of his exploration of Biblical characters.<br />Velikovsky's reconstruction remains the most viable despite the posthumous badmouthing that scholar has had to endure.  James has claimed that V didn't understand archaeology or stratigraphy, a claim that is pretentious rubbish.  Rohl and James et al accept most of the conventional New Kingdom pseudochronology, apparently willing to ignore the written record and the archaeological findings of the past century and more.  Rohl attempts to rework Velikovsky's analysis of the el-Amarna letters, but does so in order to prop up his own warmed-over version of the conventional.<br />Rohl even resorts to so-called archaeoastronomy.  Since the destruction of the palace of Ugarit occurred at some indeterminable time after the tablet he cites was recorded, and for other reasons, the eclipse data is irrelevant to the dating of the fire.  The only thing that will settle the question (and for that matter, resolve chronology questions) is scientific dating, among other things of fired ceramics, such as the eclipse tablet mentioned above.  When the thermoluminescence date shows a much more recent origin, all thermoluminescence dating will be called into question.  Should be fun.<br />As Velikovsky pointed out over twenty years ago, the conventional date for Hammurabi was reduced by nearly six centuries -- quite an error considering how reliable the conventional chronology is supposed to be.  Where Rohl agrees with Velikovsky (check the index for at least two instances in which V is mentioned by name) he is on solid ground -- as in his identification of the era of Joseph.  The book is weakened by his devotion to the garbled chronology of the New Kingdom of Egypt.<br />Still recommended for those who enjoy ancient history, particularly for those considering works by Bauval or Hancock.<br />Also of interest:<br />-:- Ages In Chaos by Immanuel Velikovsky (0848814975)<br />-:- The Secret of Crete by Hans Wunderlich (0026316005, 0285621645, out of print)<br />-:- Centuries of Darkness by Peter James (0813519500, 0813519519, 022402647X)<br />-:- Murder of Tutankhamen by Bob Brier (0425166899)<br />-:- Giving Goliath His Due by Neal Bierling (0801010187; out of print; available online; suffers from the author's reliance on the conventional pseudochronology)<br />-:- Voices of the Rocks by Robert Schoch et al (0609603698)<br />-:- Serpent in the Sky by John Anthony West (0835606910, 0517566354, 0060145811)<br />-:- The Mysteries of the Sphinx (VHS, available online only)<br />-:- Plato Prehistorian by Mary Settegast (0940262347, 0961733314)	2000-12-18

This assumes that the Earth has had basically the same conditions, free of catastrophes, and that assumption is laughable at this point.<BR><BR>I noticed that even in the multi-starred reviews scientific errors are cited.  Considering that the authors' conclusions miraculously match their original assumptions, I'm not too surprised to read that, although the high ratings on this title do surprise.<BR><BR>Fossil evidence shows that the Moon couldn't possibly have arisen from an impact on the proto-Earth.  Nautilus shells today show about 30 daily growth lines per \\"month\\".  420 million years ago they had a mere nine days.  The Moon's orbital period was nine days, its distance was less than half its present value, and Earth's rate of rotation was faster.  [Larry Gedney, \\"When the Days Were Shorter\\", Alaska Science Forum]<BR><BR>Since most of the distance between Earth and Moon has accumulated in the past 420 million years, it's impossible that the Moon was born of impact four billion years ago.  That's the hard evidence.  The alternatives include that the Earth has had a series of moons and lost the others (Hoerbiger), or that the current Moon is the only one Earth has had, but has lost it and recaptured it at least once, or that the Earth was formerly in proximity to a different larger body (i.e., not a satellite of the Sun).<BR><BR>The simplest model is that the Moon must have been captured sometime during or shortly before the most recent 420 million year interval -- less than ten per cent of the age of the Earth.  Microbial life on Earth is believed to be attested in microfossils at least 3 billion years old.  Therefore, the Moon is irrelevant to the origin of life on Earth -- unless one wishes to assume repeated captures and losses of the Moon.<BR><BR>Ward and Brownlee think that the Moon has always been around and has been one of the indispensible factors in the rise and evolution of life.  It's hogwash.  Even without the Moon, the Sun produces one third of the tides -- the tides being W&B's most important consequence of the existence of the Moon.<BR><BR>Since a satellite in prograde orbit and rotation will enjoy a momentum transfer from the parent body, the Earth must have formed closer to the Sun, meaning that the tides (provided there were seas) from the Sun alone were larger four and a half billion years ago.<BR><BR>The book is an elaborate apologia for Darwin.  The gradualist drivel -- tides, glaciation, continental drift (oops, \\"plate tectonics\\"), axis wobble, etc -- are there as props, but are likewise there to be propped.<BR><BR>While not a creationist or young-Earther myself, the hostility toward some of the better reviews which expressed such a view is pretty much what I'd expect.  The similar high ratings for the title by reviewers of both stripes may betray the same level of credulity that could buy into this book's claims.  Some creationists reject life on other worlds because the Bible sez humans were created by God.  The secular fans of this title reject life on other worlds because that could open the door to UFOs, transluminal space flight, ETs, and other things that they claim to know are impossible.<BR><BR>While this book may prop up a few different believers, it isn't scientific.  Lovers of science fiction may enjoy it.  Those interested in the sociology of belief may find it, uh, indispensible.<BR><BR>No paperback version has come out (as of early January 2003).

Hapgood's Path of the Pole attributes the change in Antarctic climate to a crustal displacement, which took place thousands of years ago over several thousand years.<br />The Flem-Aths followed Hapgood, but claimed that the crustal displacements took place in very short time frames, and on a regularly scheduled basis.  This is just another attempt to get catastrophe to behave itself, using in effect no data whatsoever, although it's obvious the Flem-Aths did a lot of work in support of their hypothesis.<br />Best of any of the Atlantis books (for now) is that of Mary Settegast, Plato Prehistorian, originally published in the mid 1980s but out in a nice new year 2000 edition, probably on the strength of Robert Schoch's and Richard Ellis' references in their respective works.	2000-09-28

While this is not a work on which most households would  spend hundreds of dollars, there really is no substitute for Melton's  masterpiece.  Even defunct and/or oddball sects are included, such as  Kennedy worshippers, the House of David, and schismatic versions of many  faiths.

Self-styled Independent Egyptologist Moustafa Gadalla claims that the Hebrew leader Moses was actually the heretic Akhenaton, that the Biblical King David was the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmosis III, Amenhotep III was the  Biblical Solomon, (which by the way makes him the father of Moses since  Amenhotep IV was the original name for Akhenaton), the Biblical patriarch  Joseph as the Egyptian vizier Yuya (grandfather of an Egyptian queen), the  Egyptian prince Semenkhkare (brother of Tutankhamen) as the brother of  Akhenaton, etcetera. By this system the Old Testament becomes a loop with  Moses living after David and Solomon.<br />Of course, there are those who  would not object to his framework when it is stated in such stark terms,  but it seems to me that any reasonable person would.  This is not a work of  history, it is a polemic.  While it is a cheap book, it is better to  experience it by finding it at the local library.<br />Those interested in  theories of extreme antiquity of the Sphinx should read &quot;Voices of the  Rocks&quot; by Robert Schoch, or possibly &quot;Serpent in the Sky&quot; by  John Anthony West (preferably the former).  Gadalla misappropriates the  findings of (for example) water erosion on the Sphinx without giving  attribution.	2000-06-14

This short work will be interesting to those who enjoyed the &quot;Gladiator&quot; movie and even more interesting to those who didn't.  Casson derived this book in part from his other books, all of which I would  wholeheartedly recommend.  The short length of this title makes it a  worthwhile introduction to Casson's writing, and an excellent gift for  teens who express an interest in ancient Rome, ancient history, or the  aforementioned movie.	2000-06-14

Originally published in the 1970s it is in a 1994 softbound edition with very few changes. The book has chapters on inns and  restaurants, ancient tourism, travel by sea, travel by land, and ancient  postal systems. Although this may sound like it's pretty dry, it should  prove to be very interesting to anyone who likes history of any kind, and  is quite amusing in spots.<br />For example, when pork, a popular meat, was  unavailable or too expensive, unethical restauranteurs would sometimes  substitute human flesh which apparently is indistinguishable (I wouldn't  know) and generally quite cheap and available (this was in Roman times, so  that shouldn't be too surprising I guess). Okay, that's a little more  gruesome than it is amusing, but trust me, there are amusing things in the  book and it is so interesting that you should fly through it and wind up  wanting more.  Of the book, not the pork.<br />Other books by this author  include &quot;The Ancient Mariners&quot; which just came out in a new and  greatly revised edition. I recommend the older edition having read it, and  recommend the new edition because Casson is a qualified expert and very  good writer. It's sometimes hard for me to believe a writer on ancient  history could be so entertaining, and I love ancient history.	2000-06-14

The new edition has been extensively edited, with some new material, but the  chapter structure appears to be very much the same as in the old edition.   This work is an excellent companion to Casson's &quot;Travel In The Ancient  World&quot;, but is not about travel.  The construction of ships is very  old, and the evolution of building methods and sheer size during ancient  times makes for fascinating reading.  Casson gets my vote for most readable  historian, at least regarding ancient history, and I doubt that anyone with  an interest in ships and sailing would be able to put this down.  Casson's  discussion of ancient commercial connections in the Indian Ocean, or the  relative size of (for example) the grain hauling behemoths and the much  smaller vessels of our more familiar &quot;Age of Sail&quot; should be of  interest to those who think Columbus was last, as well as to those with  more conventional views.	2000-06-14

This is really two biographies in one  volume, although it seemed to give more emphasis to Machiavelli, and deals  for the most part with a small part of their lives.<br />The controversial  part of this is the dispassionate approach taken to these characters, and  showing them in a new light which may conflict with the usual tired old  ways.<br />Yes, da Vinci was ahead of his time, yes, he was a master of many  arts and sciences, but he was also a failure at almost everything he ever  did.<br />Yes, Machiavelli was the quintessential politician, yes, he may have  been an atheist for all practical purposes, but he acted in accordance with  a system of political ethics (jumbo shrimp?) and tried to do his best for  his city whether it was his beloved republic or some sort of aristocratic  or oligarchic state.<br />Masters writes well about several difficult subjects  in this one volume. I was very impressed with all of it.	2000-06-13

While not the only such event in human times, even in  that region, this research has already increased awareness of the role of  sudden, unique events in the history and prehistory of our world.<br />On the  other hand, the origin of agriculture is at least 14,000 years BP, long  before this flood.  Mary Settegast's &quot;Plato Prehistorian&quot; is an  excellent survey work for those interested in &quot;Noah's Flood&quot; or  prehistory in general, as well as being the best half-book written on the  subject of Plato's tale of Atlantis.  The town of Catal Huyuk predates this  flood, but as Settegast writes, this very old town sprang up as if from  nothing, indicating that its founders came from elsewhere.  That origin  place is probably now under water.  The melting glaciers forced the human  inhabitants of the world's coastlines to higher ground, such that the sites  with the roots of stone-age culture are now drowned.<br />This is not a book  that explains the Biblical flood, and contrary to the slapdash treatment  given that particular flood story in this book and elsewhere, its source  doesn't lie in a Sumerian epic.  There are literally hundreds of flood  stories, and while all have certain common elements, each is unique.	2000-06-13

It's easy going and most will polish it off in no time.  The early chapters deal with the geological dating of the Sphinx.  His critiques of some of the other writers about the Sphinx and the other monuments of Giza are cogent and not  condescending, which reveals his good character as well as his  intelligence.  Schoch highlights the difficulty or impossibility of  explaining the onset of the ice ages (for example) using uniform  principles, and discusses interesting and scientific catastrophic  alternatives, all the while remaining philosophically uniformitarian.  His  citation of Mary Settegast's &quot;Plato Prehistorian&quot; led to my  reading that book.	2000-04-24

Myth, Religion, Archaeology	Books	5	27	31	N	N	Best Book I've Read in Two Years	I'm currently reading the original (1986/87) edition of this book.  First  saw it cited in Robert Schoch's &quot;Voices of the Rocks&quot; which I  also highly recommend.  Mary Settegast has produced a well written, well  reasoned, and well documented survey work.  She builds a case for the  identification of the Magdalenian culture as the historical basis for  Plato's Atlantis legend.  This is analogous to Schliemann's use of Homer's  Trojan war accounts to locate the historical Troy.  While not necessarily  accurate in certain particulars (conversations between characters etc),  each tale is a retelling and preservation of an historical event with many  verifiable facts.	2000-04-18

While the author's choices were  of course arbitrary, and may have been dependent on the places he was  allowed to go, many of these are little known and the thumbnail histories  of each are worthwhile.	2000-04-09

The problem as I see it is summed up in the blurb on the dust jacket - &quot;...the unmatched Roman  imperial navy...succeeded in momentarily clearing the surrounding waters of  pirates, but was useless when barbarians came from the interior and  mutilated Roman defenses.&quot;  By the time the barbarians did this, the  Roman navy in effect had ceased to exist.  This is such an oversight on the  author's part that it's difficult to take the book seriously - and Starr is  an historian with a large list of titles to his credit.<br />Works by Lionel  Casson are listed in the bibliography but there are no references in the  index.  Starr's quotes and anecdotes from ancient times are informative and  interesting, though mishandled and misinterpreted. Obviously Starr is a  landlubber, or perhaps his mother got sick on a boat ride when she was  pregnant with him.<br />The prolific (though sometimes cranky) Michael Grant  has a title in print regarding the near-collapse of the Roman Empire in the  3rd c that may illuminate the problems of the barbarian invasions.  Lionel  Casson's &quot;Travel in the Ancient World&quot; has chapters about travel  by sea and the effectiveness of the Roman navy at eradicating piracy.  His  &quot;Ancient Mariners&quot; is out in a new edition and that is also  recommended.<br />Although Starr fails to make his case, this short book is  worth a read.	2000-02-22

The idea of a now-submerged abode of humans has been ignored and  derided even since the belief in the ice ages arose in the 19th century.   The sea level has not been the same throughout history, and it is usual for  the temperature to rise with lower altitudes at a given latitude, so it is  not surprising that anyone around at the time would have sought lower  ground.	2000-02-17

Geomagnetic reversals (both real and imaginary) are themselves unexplained.<br />The Ice Ages and other climate changes (among other things)  are best explained by unique events that are nonetheless similar to one  another and of celestial origins.<br />This book is yet another attempt to try  to get catastrophes to behave themselves.  Try Walter Alvarez' &quot;T Rex  and the Crater of Doom&quot;, John Lewis &quot;Rain of Fire and Ice&quot;,  or James Powell's &quot;Night Comes To The Cretaceous&quot;.  The Powell  book is better than the Alvarez book, but the Alvarez book is probably a  good place to start if you're buying this for a young student.	1999-05-29
