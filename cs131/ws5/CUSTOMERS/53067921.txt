Yet, it came not from a &quot;wild-eyed&quot; Republican, but from a &quot;caring&quot; Democrat. No doubt, the repercussions of this on Americans was an important factor in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This book makes a valuable contribution to the poltical literature of this period and is must reading for any student of the American political system.	2001-03-06
