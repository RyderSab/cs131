US	51272994	REJYV9RH4E6GP	0395837049	237872579	Arkansas: Three Novellas	Books	3	2	5	N	N	A Disappointment	After reading Leavitt's Family Dancing and The Lost Language of Cranes (two superior words), this book came as a disappointment. The writing is  not as crisp and gently flowing as the other works I have read, and the  stories... well, I will cover those individually.<br />The Term Paper Artist:  The author here indulges himself in a little fantasy and shameless defense  on behalf of contraversy raised by one of his novels. Really, I think that  the only way this story can be viewed as having sufficient redeaming  qualities to justify its publication is by reading it as a very good,  slightly literary piece of gay erotica. Serving this function I think the  story did an excellent job. Otherwise the story flopped. At first I thought  overcoming the fact that the character was the author (more or less) would  be difficult, but I got over that pretty quickly. The moping and whining  about the critical slathering he got over While England Sleeps was  admitable, but got very tiring by the end. (2.5*)<br />The Wooden Anniversary:  Reading this by itself with no previous knowledge of the characters might  have lead to a slightly higher review, but I have read  &quot;Dedicated&quot; from Family Dancing. Consequently, I cannot help but  compare the two. What both Celia and Nathan became is hard to believe in  the period of time between the stories, and Leavitt does not provide enough  to make it very believable. As I mentioned in discussing &quot;The  Termpaper Artist,&quot; Leavitt's word style has grown heavier and harder  to read, which detracted yet more. If I were to rate this simply on its  plot and leave out the writing and any knowledge of the previous story  containing the two main characters, it would most likely get a four and a  half to five star rating. But I can only justify giving it three and a  half. (3.5*)<br />Saturn Street: This story was actually pretty good. It was  touching even if the main character was not someone I would wish to know  too closely inlife. I do feel it was longer than it could have been,  though. And again, Leavitt's lessened word-style brings it down some more.  (3.5*)<br />EDITION WARNING: I do not know if this problem is widespread or if  I am a rare case. I got the hardcover edition of this book, and the ink  smelled horribly. I got headaches reading this book because of it. I  quickly resorted to holding the book far away from me as I read it with a  fan blowing away from me on the page, and I ended up getting eye-strain  instead of headaches. Keep this in mind, and consider getting another  edition.	2000-08-21

In this book lies proof that such stereotype cannot  only be overcome, but shattered; Straub can write circles around most, if  not all of his contemporaries, in horror and outside of it. The talent and  strength of his writing deserves to be revered with such masters as John  Irving. <br />This is not the type of review introduction I ever imagined  myself giving to a writer whoes primary horror influence is H. P.  Lovecraft. I myself am a fan of Lovecraft, but he i not a writer to be held  in a very high literary esteem. And this is a good place to note that  anyone interested in getting the most out of this book is recomended to  first read a volume of Lovecraft (with special attention to The Dunwich  Horror, Call of Cthulu, and Shunned House). <br />The character in this story  is fleshed out more than any other I've ever read in the genre. The mastery  Straub has over words is hypnotic, powerful, and beautiful. The plot keeps  you guessing until the end; Straub does not let you figure it all out until  he reveals it. The constant element of the mysterious is very rivetting. At  no point did I feel I was wading through slush to get back on track of the  exiting plot. All leads to a satisfying climax and a final paragraph that  will leave your spine tingling and leave you feeling greatly disturbed for  a good while. <br />In other words, read this book. The only book I have ever  read that felt up to the quality of this book in most aspects was Sacrament  by Clive Barker.	2000-08-21

This book absorbed me very  quickly and would not let me go until I finished... and now I can't wait to  get the sequal. McCourt tells his life beautifully, using a  child's-point-of-view style of narrative that his honest, cute, and  humorous. He brings all the characters around him to life and gives them  enough personality to make you feel like you know then; and perhaps you do  in the carnation of a friend or relative of your own. Insightful of his own  past, without letting a trace of his future voice enter, McCourt has  entered into the literary world a memoir to be heralded and studied by all.	2000-08-21

It is the first work I read of Vidal's and I am very glad I ran into it (I saw it in Bargain  Books at Barnes and Nobel, and such a low price on an author I'd been  wanting to read was too tempting :-). The first story, &quot;Three  Stratagems,&quot; is a curious little gem about a hustler garnering the  interest of a wealthy man. The atmosphere and narration are absorbing, and  what happens at the end when the young hustler is in the rich man's room is  truly surprising. &quot;The Robin,&quot; is a short and disquieting piece  about an old man looking back upon the cruelties of youth. &quot;A Moment  of Green Laurel&quot; was definately interesting; as you read you strugle  to figure out if the main character is crazy or the memories that haunt him  do materialize in the way they do. At the end of the story, he finds  himself face to face with himself as a young boy. &quot;The Zenner  Trophy&quot; is a touching and aptly written piece. A boy is being evicted  from his high school a mere couple weeks before graduation after being  caught having never-specified homosexual relations with another student,  but it is to be discovered that the closeted teacher sent to give him the  news is taken it hard while the boy is seemingly indifferent; a great story  on the commentary of the growing strength of each generation. &quot;Erlinda  and Mr Coffin,&quot; is not the books most entertaining piece, but it is  decent anyway. It deals with the internal struggle of an old woman who  fears what friens will think because she has a non-white girl staying in  her boarding-house/hotel, as well as a dramatic fight between the girl--who  has amazing voice-acting abilities--and the opporater of a local theatre.  &quot;Pages From An Abandoned Journal,&quot; is a fun, interesting story of  the evolution of one man from being engaged to a woman, and the events that  bring him to self realization. The story ends with him gay-clubbing and  talking of his ex-lover, Bill. He meets some very interesting and  entertaining characters on the way. The book ends with &quot;The Ladies of  the Library,&quot; which is a very intriguing piece reported to have many   shades of Mann's A Death In Venice (I have not read the work yet, so I can  not verify the similarities or their extent.)<br />This is a great collection,  and a gay classic from when homosexuality was still called &quot;sexual  inversion.&quot;	2000-08-12

I did find the book immensely to my disliking,  however. I couldn't help but to be annoyed as I read it. I do not care how  accurate the children's speech patterns may have been, it was obnoxious to  have to deal with. The term &quot;littluns&quot; got under my skin and  stayed there like a piece of debris trapped deep around one's eye. Also  difficult to bear was that the antagonists were too hateable, which really  knows how to irritate. The childish ways of the book were simply annoying.  Also annoying was the fact that any grown up reader and likely most child  readers had to deal with knowing there was no true &quot;beast&quot; from  the beginning.<br />This would probably be a decent book to have elementary  school students read, but my having had to read it in 10th grade was  ridiculous. If you've over the age of 10 and/or dislike kids as much as I  do, pass this one by as a favor to yourself.	2000-08-11

It is not  wonder this, Leavitt's debut, brought so much critical acclaim along with a  warm welcome of Leavitt to the Literary community. Of the nine stories  contained, most were wonderfuly written (Leavitt has a way with words, and  when reading his writing, it is like sipping a sweet drink that goes down  smooth and cool.) The most wonderful stories in this volume are  &quot;Territory,&quot; &quot;The Lost Cottage,&quot; &quot;Danny in  Transit,&quot; &quot;Family Dancing,&quot; &quot;Out Here,&quot; and  &quot;Dedicated. The only stories I didn't particularly like were  &quot;Counting Months,&quot; &quot;Aliens,&quot; and &quot;Radiation.&quot;  And of these last, even they had their good qualities.

When I am given the task of writing a review such a wonderful book, I have to wonder where to start. Leavitt's writing is fresh, beautiful, and goes  down so smooth you don't realize you have the pages turning until you stop  and look to see how much you've read. The breadth and accuracy of emotions  portrayed in this book are truly extrodinary. This is truly a beautiful  story that will stay with me in my heart. My heart goes out to Rose, who  has to contend with so much and wonder if she gives off pheromones that  turn men gay. My sympathies find their way to Owen who struggles with an  issue his whole life, and only finds that he took it the wrong direction  and wasted it and hurt someone that he love--but not in the way he might  have originally thought he would. And I send a whole spectrum of my  emotions to Philip whoes personality and feelings in many ways reflect my  own; Philip's strugle is the most completely documented. The novel comes to  a closing in which the reader is left to speculate where things will go  from there, and I have to complain, but the complaint is mostly because by  that point I never wanted the novel to end. While Edmund White proves to be  the best gay writer of his generation, David Leavitt takes the tourch and  makes it burn even brighter. And for that he is to be celbrated. <br />This  was the first Leavitt novel I read, and I followed it up with his wondeful  collection, Family Dancing. I am now reading Arkansas: Three Novellas.  Prejudice hurts us, but the mainstream suffers more than they know for not  finding and embracing a book of such beauty.	2000-08-08

It is the tale of a banker who encounters a whole lot of bad luck and is  convicted of murdering his wife. The tale recounts his time in prison up to  an ingenious escape. It is recounted through the eyes of his prison friend,  Red. Well written and moving. (5 stars)<br />Apt Pupil: I was expecting to  love this one, but alas I did not. It was dull and uncompelling. The  premise itself was excellent--a boy who discovers a Nazi war criminal in  his neighborhood and threatens to turn him in if he does not satisfy the  boy's morbid curiosity. Unfrotunately, the story as King wrote it fell  flat. (1.5 stars)<br />The Body: I couldn't even finish this one. I gave up  halfway through with one question on my mind: Who cares?  There was  nothing to pull me into the story at all. <br />The Breathing Method: This was  an enjoyable little piece that is actually two stories in one. The  wrap-around story is about a &quot;club that's not a club&quot; where old  men gather and tell stories. Inside the meeting place of the club are many  brand names not to be found in the outside world, and books by authors and  publishers no one on the outside world has heard of. The story within this  story is that of the Breathing Method. This is told by a doctor among the  group who reaccounts a story about a woman he once attended to that went to  great lengths to deliver her baby. I won't spoil the surprise. (4 stars)	2000-07-05

Some of the articles within hold excellent advice, others  are poor, and some are just there to take up space and have nothing to do  with writing horror at all. It is, however, of no weaker quality than any  of the other books I've read put out by the Horror Writers Association. If  you are interested in writing within the horror genre, it is worth reading  for some of the value it does contain.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and  her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and  eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is  approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot;  And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a  certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to  London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists.  The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I  appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas  Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been  exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character  of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human.  This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes.  A good classic read.	2000-06-18

It has its strenghths and weaknesses, which is typical for a first novel, but its  weaknesses are unforgivable. My first bad sign was to find out that Mann is  a journalist--journalists often seem to write the worst books. This book  was filled with cliches (admittedly so, though; the narrator points out the  cliches, which is even sadder.) In the beginning of the novel, I found the  character to be appauling and completely unsympathetic; he portrays the a  member of the sex-crazed populous that I try to failingly reassure myself  is not taking over the majority of the gay male population. He and his  boyfriend partake in the sickening but increasingly common &quot;open&quot;  relationship and do nothing but tear each other apart with it. The narrator  also holds some very closed minded belifs of youth--he is a major  practitioner of agism--and attacks and tries ignorantly to completely bash  monogamy. In the middle of the novel the character becomes a little more  sympathetic when he falls in love with a boy about 10 years his junior; he,  of course, patronizes him and refuses to give anything he says much  credibility because of his lesser age (unfortunately, as a gay youth, I  encounter this form of ignorance often.) He is emotionally abusive and  cruel to this young man, and Mann portrays it far too sympathetically for  the circumstances. It is also hard to fathom why this boy has stayed around  through this and how the boy manages to fall in love with him. In spite of  all of this, the middle portion of the novel manages to be worth reading  for some of the &quot;heart&quot; it contains. The ending again fails  miserably in one of the worst ways a book can fail... the other attempts to  be profound; the problem comes when his attempt fails because he tries to  be more profound that he is. So basically, Mann presents himself as atransparent B.S. Artist. Why, then, you ask, did I give this book a 3*  rating? The characterization is strong, even if some of the characters are  unlikeable. (I would date Eduardo in a heartbeat!  In fact, I've been  looking for someone like him for a long time.) And as I stated earlier, the  middle of the book has a lot of heart (accounting for about 2/3 the  book--not just a few pages in the very center.) Another final flaw to point  out, however, is that the book is hopelessly autobiographical of the  Author. It is hard to write semi-autobiographical fiction (the closer to  the author's life, the harder) objectively enough to create a quality  product. The earlier into the authors career such a book is written, the  worse it is likely to be. So why do so many writers do particularly  autobiographical first novels? Because they don't know what else to write.  Perhaps he will write something better in the future. After reading this  one, though, I am not very likely to read anything else he puts out to see  if he's progressed.	2000-06-18

In the beginning, Chriton makes a very cheap resurection of Ian Malcom. It is true that Malcom was my favorite character--he and I share like humors--in Jurassic  Park and still is in this book. But that does NOT excuse the way he was  brough back. It was quite clear in Jurassic Park that Malcom died; in the  beginning of Lost World, however, Chrichton states that everyone only  THOUGHT that Malcom died and that he really hadn't, but many newstations  still reported that he did. I am sorry, but the man was surrounded by all  kinds of scientists when he died, and I am pretty confidant that a  scientist knows how to check a pulse, check for breathing, or otherwise  know if someone is actually dead even if they are not M.D.'s.  Moving  on: once you get past the afformentioned annoyance, this book picks up pace  and becomes better than Jurassic Park. I read the last 120 pages in one  sitting, which is something I never do. The character development is  excellent, the plot is fast and action packed, and it again challenges your  mind to think. This is a great read with the one fatal flaw, but if you can  get over it you're in for a good time.	2000-06-16

This book was truly well done, and rightfully and lasting classic. The span of characters was vast, and the story well told. One of few criticisms I could find with this book  was that I found most of the emotional value of the story fall flat. The  only emotional scene that really caught most of its capability to move the  read was one of the last.... This is, otherwise, a  very entertaining and well done read. Be warned, however, that it WAS  written in Victorian England, so if you have difficulty reading older  dialects of English you may have some trouble with this book.	2000-06-16

I devoured this book because it kept me interested the  whole way through... it was very hard to put down. Chrichton explains the  scientific aspects of his book very well and in the process, manages to  educate you, make you think, and perhaps give you some interest in new  fields (I had never heard of Chaos Theory until this book.) This is far  better than the cheap Spielberg movie that came after. I highly recommend  it to anyone who enjoys to be entertained without choking down brain-dead  material (a la most commercial fiction and bestsellers.) If you are not a  science fiction fan, do not worry; I am not either, but I loved to book  anyway. And I feel obligated to note that you should not judge this book  based on Chriton's other works (as often can be done); The Andromeda Strain  WAS awful, but this is not--I've also heard negative things about some of  his other early works.	2000-06-16

I am decidedly more a fan of her short stories. This work was pretty good (not great, but  pretty good) in the beginning, and then by the ending, it took all I had to  get the motivation to finish it--I put the book down for a month with the  last 50 pages unread with no intent to pick it up again, but then decided  that since I had gotten that far, I might as well finish it. The story was  on the weaker end of OK. Not a highly recomended book.	2000-06-13

It's also a great read. I was first introduced to Agatha Chritie in sixth grade by my gifted teacher, and have been a Poirot fan ever since--I did a book  report on a Ms. Marple book, but decided later that that  funny little  Belgian gent was more my type. Christie creates a wondeful and entertaining  character in Hercule Poirot. He's conceited in a funny way, immaculately  groomed, and brilliant in solving crimes; he also has a way of dropping  subtle and interesting crumbs along the way and not revealing all he know  until the end. Christie never fails to surprise, either, as to who the  perpatrator is. This ending is truly the last you'd expect. The Queen of  the mystery genre (says who? me, that's who) is at her most wonderful prime  in this delightful first novel. It's inriguingly written, the characters  are great, and it is short. A must read.	2000-06-13

The best work in the book is &quot;Stephen,&quot; the  Bram Stoker Award winning Short Story (I actually think they counted it as  a Novella) by Elizabeth Massie. Also very good was the ever-wonderful Poppy  Z. Brite's &quot;His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood.&quot; Yes, that is  Brite's most collected story, but this anthology was the first place it  appeared.

Why can't he always right this well? The premise is a staple to Koontz--a government science lab and the results of their expierements.  The result is a strong novel of suspense and horror set in vegas and packed  with emotion. This is the first &quot;adult horror&quot; novel I ever read  and I still think it is a particularly good one. It is the book that helped  me bridge the gap between Young Adult and Adult years ago (no, not R.L.  Stine... I started reading the better end of YA Fiction early on.) The  story opens with a mother still grieving the loss of her son a year ago in  a scouting accident; after thinking she sees him in a car, strange things  start to happen which point to the possibility that he's still alive. <br />A  good read.	2000-06-11

Clegg has a strong and wonderful imagination, and created a pretty good book with it  here. The book covers a span of 20 years and is told in no particular  order; this is kind of annoying but forgiven for the suspense it creates  and the ability to keep your mind engaged as you read it. It does have some  small irritants (Characters given names such as &quot;the Juicer&quot; and  &quot;the Bone&quot; is rather childish and obnoxious), and I was annoyed  by a faux newspaper clipping that read NOTHING like a newspaper  clipping--Clegg obviously never took any classes in journalism. I also  recall how I was struck by the particularly strong characterization of  Peter in his youth (the best developed character in the book), but how weak  and unlogical the characterization of Peter as an adult.       Dispite the  aformentioned technical errors, this book made an exceptional read. I  recommend it to any horror fan. It is unfortunate to think that many of  those errors could have been avoided if Clegg would have ended up with a  better publisher--Leisure does a commendable job, but while his heart is in  the right place, Don D'auria does a less-than-ideal job as an editor.	2000-06-10

It is the first of the Bachman Books, and what I feel to be the best King has ever written. In the process, two of the other Bachman Books--The  Long Walk and Roadwork--also exceptional King works, have fallen out of  print. Rage is the most touching, gripping, and well written thing King has  ever produced. Early in the story,a disturbed student kills his mathteacher  and holds his class hostage at gunpoint. In the beginning you can only feel  that this boy is seriously disturbed, but by the end you--the reader--and  his entire class feel sorry for HIM. King allowed himself to be convinced  to take it off of the market, however, due to the rise of high school  shootings; as a horror writer, he should not fear subject matter. He should  also realize that his book is NOT the reason kids do such things. These  things happened before King ever thought to write about them and will  continue to happen weather or not they are written about. And perhaps if we  are presented with more novels like King's which show the perpetrator in a  sympathetic light we may be able to understand these people better and do  more to help them BEFORE matters get that far along. Unfortunately, the  only piece of this fabulous collection that remains in print now is The  Running Man--while this is a good work, it is the weakest in the  collection. I advise you all to track this title down in your local used  book store before it becomes impossible to find.	2000-06-10

In a race for his own  survival he finds himself taking things over the edge, and eventually  &quot;taking up his complaint&quot; with the very president of the  telivision company in a very unfriendly way. An action packed story similar  in message and theme as The Long Walk, this story will keep you reading  until the end. I certainly give it my recomendation.	2000-06-10

(Rage being the Bachman Title King removed from print out of the dispicable act of Self censorship--and to make  matters sadder, it was his best work.)It discribes a sporting event that is  truly horrible in its particulars that everyone gathers to watch with great  excitement. Of 100 boys, only one will win. And the consolation prize for  the 99 that don't... death. King does a brilliant job getting you inside  the head of the main character, and the emotion can be hard hitting. The  story is well paced and well told, and the ending is more appropriate and  surprising than I could have ever expected. A definate must read.	2000-06-10

This is a wonderful forray out of his standard genre, sci-fi,  and into horror. I read this after reading numerous recommendations of it  as a classic by the likes of Stephen King and Robert Weinberg, and was not  dissapointed I did. This is a classic that I found disturbing and  un-put-downable for the first few chapters, and highlly satisfying by the  end. Quite a premise: a man loses 3 hours of his life. There are hints that  suggest he did something unthinkable during this time frame, so he must now  search for what happened during this timeframe. His search takes him on a  very memorable journey and what he finds is truly horrifying. This is not a  particularly long book--it is said he wrote it on a train-ride from  California to New York--but it is very much worth reading.	2000-06-10

I truly enjoyed the first--Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston--but this one just didn't do it for me. It was very slow in  the beginning, though eventually became I mediocre/decent/tolerable book,  but nothing I would recommend. It is the narrative of a WWI soldier and his  expierence in the war; the novel, of course, attacks the whole trite and  over-used &quot;extreme circumstances cause rapid maturation&quot; theme.  The narrative did not flow well as the author jumped from one expierience  to another rapidly so as to include as many different types of expieriences  one might feel in such a war in the novel--this only managed to irritate me  and remind me that I was reading a book. Two biases that may also have led  to this book being less appealing to me, but perhaps moreso to other  readers are the facts that I hate wars and have no interest in them; the  bigest being that I hate the military--particularly the U.S. Military--and  this book demonstrated a few of the reasons as to why. Keep that in mind  when taking my review into account.	2000-06-09

Brite fan, this colletion is a must read, and far better than her more recent collection: Are You Loathesome Tonight. If you have not yet read Brite, however, I recommend that you start with  one of her novels, as her stories are a bit weaker and better appriciated  once you are already familiar with her style.       This collection  contains some wonderful little gems--in fact, it's filled with them.  Probably the best work in the collection--which also happens to be her most  reprinted story--is &quot;His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood.&quot;  &quot;Georgia Story,&quot; is also a nice little piece and will be  particularly loved by Brite Fans because it features Ghost and Steve from  Lost Souls. The story which I feel has the best title, and is a great story  on top of that, is &quot;Footprints in the Water.&quot; Another great story  which gets second place as far as best title is &quot;Optional Music for  Voice and Piano.&quot; I could go on and on like this, because I loved  every story.

Though until Brian de Palma made the film, few people had even heard of it. But the film version launched the careers of King, de Palma, Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, and others.<br />I  admitedly have not yet scene the film version, but the book was great. King  seems to be under the impression that this novel is very raw and  unpolished, and perhaps he is right--I admit it isn't as polished as many  books I've read, but I don't see this is a bad thing; if this is the case,  perhaps it is what made the book so good. It was a very riveting book. King  was also sucessful at getting at the emotional core of Carrie White, and  other characters involved. It is a very worthwhile read, and goes by very  quickly as it is only about 200 pages long (the original hardcover is 199  pages in length; I do not know the page count on subsequent volumes.) <br />I  definately recommend this book to anyone fond of the Horror genre or King's  work (sadly, many people--dare I say most?--who read King do not read any  of the other works within the genre; this is sad because some of the other  talents out there surpass him by far.)	2000-06-07

It is a deffinate must for horror, literature, and/or vampire fans (I fall under all three categories, with a particular stress on the former two.)  Stoker achieved some amazing imagery, a dark atmosphere, and scenes that  will never leave your mind in this novel. Its only flaw is that it is  admittedly overwritten throughout places in the middle, but its redeaming  qualities, and absorbing beginning and ending make up for this and then  some. Stoker creates strong and memorable characters--my favorite being  Abraham van Helsing; Johntathan Harker comes up in second--and all of this  is packed in a well written piece. Probably the most memorable part of the  book for me, as well as my favorite, was a speach given to Dr. Seward by  van Helsing reffering to the weakness of science (&quot;The problem with  your science is that you do not let your eyes see, nor your ears here that  which you cannot explain....&quot;)<br />This is definately a work to enjoy.  And as a further note for vampire fans, should you not consider reading the  work that truly launched literary interest in the vampire legend? No, it  was not the first vampire story, but it is one of the best and best  remembered; it is also the reason the vampire legend is what it is today.  This should be on your bookshelf along with Rice's Interview with the  vampire. (I also highly recommend Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls as a great  modern vampire work.)	2000-06-07

This is a very beautiful and  powerful story leading through the history of a Vampire named Louis. It  discusses how and when he was turned into a Vampire--at the hands of the  infamous Vampire Lestat. This is a book that truly belongs in the classic  literature section decades and centries from now, and hopefully it will  earn its place.

It is a very short work--I was able to finish it in three hours. The one thing people have difficulty with is that it is  written in an older form of English; so yes, you do have to have some  inteligence and understanding of the English language to comprehend  everything in the story. It is a strong tale with a powerful moral (though  not overdone and preachy), and truly terrifying in its implications.

I have loved some Koontz Novels, and disliked others, but none have earned as  much loathing as this. The human interest part of this story was blown up  way out of preportion (nothing new to Koontz), and the plot was obnoxious.  I'm sorry, but super-itelligent psychotic killer monkeys is far too  50s-pulp-horror for my stomach to handle without getting sick. Not to  mention how slow and dull the reading was between attacks of the mutant  monkeys. Silly little book ought to be a sci-fi thriller for three year  olds; though of course, you'd have to edit and tone done some of the scenes  first; the watching of a cremation, for example. Anyway, do your brain  cells a favor and pass this one by.

The novel is a long  chase that fails to hold my attention. It was truly dull, poorly written,  and hard on the suspention of disbelief. One bias I have that did affect my  ability to like the novel is my loathing of police and books where they are  featured as main characters--as was the case here.

The same is true for the last piece, &quot;Chase.&quot;  &quot;Trapped,&quot; is a 50 page work, that is well written and well worth  reading even if a bit silly and sci-fi cliched.&quot;Kittens&quot; was  short, but extremely disturbing. These are among the best of the  highlights, but there is more worth reading. There are a few that you wish  Koontz didn't write, or at least didn't collect, but that's true of most  all anthologies.	2000-06-03

From the very beginning it sucked me in, and did not let me go. It was particularly well written for a Koontz novel--though still quite comercialized. The novel was very suspensful, and  definately has some great twists (particularly one involving the killer's  occupation.) It also contains some very exciting moments (being hidden in a  killer's trailer as he's driving across the state, and trying to keep your  presence unknown, etc.) THe novel was very fast paced and absorbing, with  some very powerful images. The only things that were kind of tacky were a  couple of metaphors involving an elk or moose (forget what.. been a while  since I've read it), and a tacky &quot;human interest&quot; angle he tried  to achieve with the adopting of a young female victim.	2000-06-03

King managed to create great characters and a great plot. This book also managed to achieve something very rare: a couple of parts actually sent chills down my spine. There were  a few instances of humor, and plenty of horror. As you might imagine with a  book this size, though, it was a bit over written,though not until the last  250 pages. Other than needing to be a bit shorter, my only other problem  with this book was the exessive Godly/Heavenly/Christian angle of this  book, though that is a personal bias. Other than that, it was a great read.	2000-06-02

While some grabbed me and were great, some--like this one--struck me as nothing more than a poorly executed comercial effort to sell by the name of the author; and the name  of the author is about all this book has going for it.<br />Several reviewers  felt that the book started out great and got bad. I am more under the  impression that the books beginning was truly awful, and improved slightly  by the end; either way, the effect is an awful book that is only vaguely  interesting for half of it's extent. If you really want to give Koontz a  fair read, go for Intensity or The Eyes of Darkness, and leave this one on  the bookshelf. I am dissapointed in the author for even allowing this to be  published under his real name--he should have left it to one of his  extensive pseudonyms of the past.	2000-06-02

With some books I love Koontz, and with others I can't stand him (Intensity--loved him; Fear Nothing--Couldn't stand him.) This is definately a loveable book. He took an interesting take  on the history of dissappearing cultures (Roanoke colony, Bermuda Triange,  Myan City, etc.) This book definately has it's creepy moment; the two that  got under my skin were walking down an alleyway with the feeling of being  watched from above and below, and the &quot;sink&quot; scene. Don't judge  this novel by the horrible movie that was made based on it; that would be  far less than fair. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2000-06-02

Some of his novels I simply devour and consider the top of their genres (his books usually fit into several.) I also find that sometimes he disgraces himself as a writer, and  this book illistrates one of those times. The opening of this book was very  powerful and exciting; the female narrator's internal dialogue is both  touching and emotionally truthful. But after that, the book slowly declines  to a mediocrity. The book initially would have been worthy of a three star  rating, but then came the ending. Never have I felt so let down by an  ending, and this was a very cheap cop out by an author who aparently  couldn't find any better way to get his character out of the situation. He  ends up taking the ending out of his characters hands to symbolize  something more devine and spiritual, and only ends up making his climax  very anticlamitic. My advice, if you must by this book, read up to the  point when husband and wife are at the hospital and stop there.	2000-06-02

One thing I've found is that King's older works are far better and many of his newer works are getting less and less readable; but this book--from 1996--I consider to be one of his best.<br />The story is wonderful, and truly  exciting. King shows more humor than I'm used to seeing in his books (I was  laughing so hard I was in tears at the scene involving the can of peaches,  or was it fruit coctail?--it's been a while. Read it and you'll see why.  Also quite funny was a little quip about support braws, and yet another  about bull sh**, literally. There are others.)  The plot was strong, and  because of the great characterization, it will touch your heart. I read  this book in a record three days, which is a rare feet, and never with  books as big as that.<br />A great song to listen to after reading the first  chapter or two is &quot;Black Eyes, Blue Tears&quot; by Shania Twain; it  deals with abuse, and really captures the feelings you get within those  chapters.<br />Be warned: a strong suspention of disbelief is needed while  reading this book. It takes some turns toward the fantastic involving a  painting and my favorite myth from all of greek mythology (the Mynotaur in  the Labrynth.) If you like your horror to still remain pretty close to  reality in all aspects, this book will not be among your favorites. But it  is these fantastic elements that make the book so much more endearing to  me. <br />As another added bonus, the hardcover has one of the most beautiful  dustjackets I've ever seen.	2000-06-01

So why only three stars? Something about the writing made the book fall very flat, and I can't identify exactly what it is; one of my  friends--a big King fan--said she expierienced the same thing. Something  about the way the words were assembled just has a warm-milk effect on you  creating a degree of bordom and sleepiness. This is a shame, too, because  the plot is excellent; the ending is certainly interesting and unexpected  (a la Daphne de Maurier, and I don't mean anything to do with Rebecca; but  like Rebecca it does have something to do with a Hitchcock  movie--intrigued?) I would say that if you are a fan of King, this book is  worth the reading though it may be a bit tedious. If you are a lover of  great plots and are completely unaffected by how prose is written, then  this may be a five-star book to you.<br />Enjoy.	2000-06-01

This is a confession of an old woman named Dolores Claiborne (hence the tittle.) The story takes forever  to develope and leads up to only one or two relatively exciting but brief  scenes. There are no chapter breaks, meaning you'll have to pick your own  place to stop--given the choice I ended up reading only a page or two at a  time which drug out the slow reading even longer. It just wasn't worth it.  <br />The one plus: yes, he does write about women very well, but that fact  alone does not make a good book. You need more than great characterization.  You need great characterization, plot, narrative flow/pacing, prose, and  interest-holding. One out of six just doesn't do it.	2000-06-01

One thing I often here about this book is that &quot;it was great, but it was SO dark.&quot; Hello! What's with the &quot;but.&quot; It is horror, thus it is supposed to be dark (though many  writers are getting tamer and tamer to the point of horror being a new and  less impressive genre). Change those &quot;but&quot;s to &quot;and&quot;s  people<br />I saw the movie version when I was six years old and it scared me  to no end. Almost a decade later I found myself reading the book, and is  one of my favorite things King has ever writting; if I did not already know  the storyline it would have terrified me, which is something books and  movies can rarely do anymore (very very very rarely, and hardly when they  actually do.) <br />This is a well written horrorfest that should find its way  in every horror lover's library.	2000-05-31

The characterization was very very strong, and you WILL care greatly for the characters by the end; especially the admirable Ralph Roberts (If I must  grow old, may I at least be that great of an &quot;old crock.&quot;) The  storyline is highly original--I truly was in awe of King's imagination when  I read this one. It was decent reading.And finally, there is a very special  treat for those of you who love the Dark Tower Series (though I'm not a big  fan of it...at all...I'm going to give it another chance within the next  year); Just think of the little blonde boy from Drawing of the Three.  <br />The negatives: The book went on and on and on and on. King knows how to  over-write but he truly outdid himself and his book this time. My biggest  complaint with overwriting (as usual comes at the end.) The book reached  its climax, which is very effective, but then King drags the book out for  another 100 pages and creates a little mini-climax making the true one  rather..well..anticlamatic. Certainly not his best, but it's an ok read.	2000-05-31

This collection blew me away with it's  variety and wonderful stories. To date, this is the only true Short Story  collection of King's I have read (aside from a handful of stories from  Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes, which didn't even compare.) The book opens  with a lengthy (140ish page) story called The Mist; while a bit hard on  one's suspention of disbelief, I loved it and felt it was a strong story.  Other stories that really stuck in my mind and won't dislodge themselves  are Gramma, The Monkey, Nona, Here There Be Tigers (very short and  childish, but appealing in a way I can't quite put my finger on), The Raft,  and Mrs. Todd's Shortcut. This is just naming a few of the stories I felt  were above and beyond. Very seldom do I read an anthology or collection  with such a high percentage of stories I like. Of course, like any such  book, it has its duds, but they are few and far between. <br />This is a great  introduction to King, and a must-read collection if you're already a fan.	2000-05-31

I have now read everything she has published, and love her just as much. She writes in a beautifuly poetic  quality like none I've seen before. <br />This novel is a very modernized  retelling of the Haunted House story (with its own original emements), a  beautiful love story (between two guys--be warned now if this offends you),  and the metaphoric refference to a seperate comic world called BirdLand  (but it does not remain only a metaphor for the entire story.) The  characters are all very well drawn: a boy who's father, in a drunken rage,  kills his mother, brother, and himself; an interesting computer hacker; a  New Orleans stipper helplessly in love with her gay friend; and a  Jamaican-American/local marajuana dealer with a good heart. <br />I recommend  this book to anyone who has previously enjoyed Brite, and anyone who has  yet to discover her.	2000-05-28

The Dialogue in this novel is wonderfully written, rings true, and is often humorous.

Her American publisher did not want to touch it, nor did her British one. She had to send out the manuscript to other houses, and finally got  Simon&amp;Shuster to publish it here, and another notable UK publisher over  there. It is a serial killer novel with traces of Jeffrey Dahmer. Poppy  likes to jump between characters, setting up their stories that are at  first seemingly unrelated, and have them come slowly then crashingly  together at the end of the novel. She has never done it so effectively as  in this novel. A serial killer in England escapes from prison in the most  extrodinary way (I won't give this away, but it was very original!);  another similar killer in New Orleans is still practicing his habit of  killing drifters, but never locals; and indulging in their seasoned and  cooked flesh; a young New Orleans boy of Vietnamese heritage has problems  between his family finding out he is gay and his ex-boyfriend with HIV who  wants him back; finally there is the young man stricken with HIV whos only  enjoyed passtime is the pirated radio station he runs with two friends. All  of these people have their own problems, but all come together as one in a  thrilling climax. This is a gruesome, suspensive, and poetically written  novel not to be missed.	2000-05-28

What's it about?&quot;    &quot;It's  about...well...um...&quot;<br />This is not an easy novel to attempt to  describe. Say I were asked to describe Stephen King's Salem's Lot; I could  say it is about vampires who invade a small town. The listener knows about  vampires and what they generally do (suck blood, and create new vampires);  and they know how small town horror works (slow creeping suspense, as all  the people in town everyone formerly thought they knew starts to turn evil.  There is generally at least one outsider that is the center of this evil.)  By identifying the basic concepts, the listener can put it together and get  a good idea what the book is about...<br />But Clive Barker's debut novel is  far too original to even attempt to describe in any concise space. The  story is original, absorbing, and told with a degree of beauty and  compelling a way only Barker could achieve--and apparently masterered in  the very beginning.<br />I cannot tell you even vaguely what this book is  about without telling you the majority of the plot, but I can tell you that  it is not a book you will ever regret reading (and re-reading, and  re-reading.)	2000-05-27

This book did for demonic possession what Dracula did for vampires; it provided a very well  written, very disturbing classic with memorable characters that brought a  lot of recognition to an underexplored subgenre. The major reason this  novel works so well is that Blatty makes you care about his characters: An  actress mother who loves her daughter very much,a gold-hearted child who is  possessed by a vile demon, a Jesuit Priest questioning his own faith (this  idea didn't become a cliche until AFTER Blatty's book), and a fasinating  old detective with health problems. This novel not only disturbed a  generation, it disturbed the Vatican who deamed it very plausible and  terrifying. What is the most desterbing, however, is that this book has  somehow managed to go out of print. If Dracula, Frankenstein, and A Tale of  Two Cities have managed to stay unhaultedly in print, why hasn't the  Excorcist?	2000-05-27

This novel proves to be short, quick, and easy reading, but no weaker in quality because of  it--stronger, in fact, than his several hundred page long works. The story  is interesting, and adds original elements to the Gypsy Curse plotline.  Many readers may find thereselves initially envious of our  Lawyer/Protagonists new found diet plan; hit one Gypsy who isn't watching  where she's going and you can shed the pounds quickly. But the envy is  quickly replaced by horror as a formerly rotund man finds himself anorexic  (minus the critical part of the medical deffinition: he does not think he  is fat.) This book also makes you question certain aspects of justice and  revenge: who is really the &quot;good guy&quot; and who is really the  &quot;bad guy.&quot; I find that the lines here sway back and forth until  they are finally blurred beyond visibility. Also, should revenge be allowed  to extend to the avenged against's innocent loved ones? Probably not, but  you are still made to think.<br />This is a very worthwhile read, and one of  King's Semi-masterpieces.	2000-05-27

I had always heard of the famous Gulfport Murder, but didn't really know a whole lot about it. I now live in Orlando.  I got about a half an hour into the book--cringing of the poor  writing all the way--and finally couldn't take it any more. The prose is  extremely over-wrought and flowry; a true example of a journalist turning  to fiction at its worse (no Dickens, Hiassen, or Wolfe here). The man  aparently has no knowledge of the craft of writing whatsoever. Yes, I know  what you are thinking--&quot;But this is not fiction&quot;--but it still  resides under the same rules because it is presented in a chronological and  fictionalized account even if the events are true. <br />Anyway, if you have a  much stronger stomach than I do for terrible writing, you might find the  story worth reading; though I must admit, even what I was able to pick up  from the story was pretty typical in its type. <br />I would NOT advise this  book.	2000-04-03

I was pleased, as the premise was very original, and the characterization was great. There is a light erotic drive in the book  (around the thought of someone constantly watching you without your knowing  it), and a great pacing. I am now more eager than ever before to read other  Levin books; especially since I've been told this is one of his weakest  works. There is not much holding this book from being a 5* piece (it just  doesn't quite have enough something.. I can't put my finger on what), and  comes highly recommended to me.	2000-03-26

I thought the movies were ok, but not great; not to mention that the sequel appeared to be a regurgitation of the  original plot. But since Poppy Z. Brite is one of my absolute favorite  writers, I had to give this book a chance (and even sprung for the nice $50  edition--this is how sure I am of Brite's writing.) This novel holds up to  all of Brite's previous novel-length work, and quite possibly exceeds it.      The characters are amazingly developed--but aren't they always--and for  once one of her major characters is a woman!  Ok, so she used to be a  man, but the point is that she's strayed from the teenage gay mail a  little. Brite also expands on the Crow mythos, and writes a powerful story.  The main antagonist is the complete embodiment of hate and bigotry, and the  hero's purposes are genuine and satisfyingly revengeful.      I recommend  this book for anyone who loves good horror, but I warn you that Brite is a  very dark writer when it comes to her horror. Her fiction makes the works  of Steven King look as cozy as a Charles Dickens novel. <br />Enjoy!	2000-03-12

THese short pieces do a great job in showing how Poppy thinks and writes, and give you  a good grasp of her style. They do not hold up to the very high standards  of her novels though.

I found that the article was actually the introduction to Hood's book, and the only valuable part. If you missed that particular issue of Writer's Digest and  can't get a back issue, I'd advise reading the introduction as a valuable  resource, but the rest of the book simply was not worth it. It listed a lot  of emotions alphabetically (most of which authors would include without  really thinking about--I generally don't stop to ponder upon the fact that  my character is anxious; I just do it and move on.) The lists are very  repetative regurgatations of each other, and very simplistic. Those that  aren't so simplistic don't make much sense at all--there are a few  instances where she claims to be describing one emotion, but in fact is  citing examples of a totally different emotion all together. Read the  Writer's Digest article, or read the Introduction in a library or  bookstore, but otherwise the book's contence simply does not justify the  cost.	2000-03-04

By the end of  the book, the characterization has come full circle, and you really feel  for the wantings of the protagonist (a psychopathic serial killer in want  of free love). His last stated kill is his most powerful on the readers  emotions because it is such a major and built up eliment in the plot. I  like the rambling style in which Oates wrote the book. This book manages to  do something that so few other books can do to me, and that is to disturb  me. <br />The only thing I disliked about the book is that the serial killer  was gay, and that many readers may be likely to stereotype all gay people  as having the mindset or perversion of this killer (with no small credit to  various Chrisian leaders and organizations, and the far right). My only  hope is that Oates is not of that mindset herself and her character just  happened to be gay for variety. I'm also hopeful Oates didn't use the  characters sexuality to exploit society's general views for disturbingness  factor of the book.	2000-01-15

If you want to read a very well written gay novel, read Edmund White. If you are, more spacifically, looking for a gay love novel, there are many far better choices (might I recommend Boy Culture by Matthew Rettenmund.) If you would  like to give Grimsley another chance, though, read Dream Boy. While dream  boy is anything BUT a well written literary gem, I cherish it all the same  for it's heart, sentiment, and pure nostalgia of those adolecent emotions    that are never to be relived unless through a book. <br />Though also be  warned that the author has a huge ego and responds bitterly to any  criticism  in reviews. If you loathe something of his you read, either  don't your email adress, don't review it at all, or be prepared.	2000-01-12

The intimate proximatey of such a well developed character is truly amazing. White tells a wonderful sotry of a gay boy growing up in the 50's--though he never  truly accepts it; not until the second book of the series, anyhow.  <br />Warnings: Many people reviewed this book negatively and I wish to use  this space to share who will NOT enjoy this book. First of all, you must  enjoy the &quot;literary&quot; style of writing; if you don't enjoy  classics and works by the likes of John Irving than this is not for you. A  fine example is to compare it to J.D. Salenger's &quot;Catcher in the  Rye&quot;--if you read this in your schooling years and hated it, you'll  probably hate this also. If you like a solid and clear course of plot you  may not enjoy it; this book is written much like life is lived, and that is  with a degree of chaos. Also, if you are homophonic, this book is obviously  not for you unless you are attempting to open your mind. Finally, if you  are the type of person who is offended by the unappologetic beliefs of the  50's that homosexuality is an illness, etc., then you may not want to read  this; this was an issue with me, but I came to understand that this would  be the thought process of someone in the narrators posision at his age and  time. <br />I loved this book, and hope that other readers will expierience  the same amazement as I did.	1999-12-29

The story was powerful, and sucked me in.The beginning was painfully emotional and  disturbing (disturbed is all that I can feel when reading about a woman who  stays in her house with her dead husband for days until she and he are  discovered.) I would not recommend this book for those who must have a fast  action sequence, nor to those who find emotion sappy and boring. This book  is frequently criticized for it's suspected autobiographical qualities, but  what book is not autobiographical of it's author in some form? I'm sorry if  the thought of an author with a story about one's self worth telling  disturbs you, and truly suggest you culture yourself more.	1999-12-12

The story line has strong elements of the supernatural, and presents my favorite horror archetype: the witch. The portrayal of the witch is very original from all other books I've read on  the topic. This book employs a small town atmosphere that creeping horror  has always thrived on, and it is written with the efficiency of a film  (which is no suprise when you consider that the two authors who make up  &quot;J.G. Passarella&quot; are screenwriters.) This is one of the finest  debut novels of the year, and one of the finest I've read in general (a  tittle it shares with Karen Hall's &quot;Dark Debts.&quot;)	1999-12-12

The character developement is phenominal; Barker puts you into the main character's--Will Rabjohns's--head and gives you everything he's about. The  story has strong elements of fantasy, but its close proximity to reality  throughout most of it makes it strongly grounded and very plausible while  you're reading it. <br />NOTE: If you are homophobic (meaning: if  homosexuality offends you) don't read this book. This is partially friendly  advice, but mostly that I don't want to here your closed minded crap on  here.	1999-10-15

Mike Noonan is one of my favorite King characters. King applies a very literary style in this book that I've never seen him employ before, and it is very pleasing.  Refferences to literature are very much a treat for readers, as well as the  occasionally music refference for music lovers (one instance which mixes a  little of both that I found very amusing occured near the beginning of the  book: &quot;You don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind,  you don't tug the mask of that ol' Lone Ranger, and you don't mess around  with Mary Higgins Clark.&quot;)	1999-10-14

The story line, though probably impressive in the 50s, is a little simple by today's standards. Of  the short stories that followed, two were great, a few were ok/good, and  the rest were pathetic.<br />If you are a true lover of the horror genre then  this is a classic that you probably don't want to overlook, but it's not  the greatest	1999-08-24

I began reading it and was very upset to find that it had been written in second person (a  viewpoint I loathe greatly, and feel should only be used for cookbooks). I  immidiately through it across the room and returned to the bookstore. Also  in the bargain bin a few weeks later I found &quot;Dream Boy.&quot; After  checking at the store to make sure it was not written in second person (it  wasn't) I decided to give Grimsely another chance. <br />I am very glad I did.  This story is beautifully written and touching throughout. It greatly  reminded me of my first love (which is not that far back, as I am only 15).  I felt deep attatchments to both main characters, particulary the POV  character. I read this book a chapter at a time right before bed (spending  the daytime reading horror mostly) and would end up crying myself to sleep,  and feeling impressed that the author caputered this book so well. <br />The  one criticism I have concerning this book is the ending. Grimsley applied a  very supernatural ending--which would be fine if the supernatural played a  more important roll throughout the book--and left things very unresolved. I  left this book with a sense of disclosure, and longed to know more of what  really happened (and Mr. Practical-Sensible--who had not been turned off  during this book because of the reality of it until the end--simply refused  to believe the ending provided). <br />All in all, this book is very worth  reading, but if you like your books to end with any closure and truness to  the story, you may want to pass on this one.	1999-07-28

He is intelegent, but not THAT  intelegent. Some of his ideas and beliefs are good,but simple. I truly  expected more. One phraze that kept popping in my head throughout the book  was &quot;yeah right!&quot; His description of his life is just too over  the top. Until I began reading the book I truly did not think he was a  fabrication,but I now have to wonder. Don't waste your time or brain cells  on this book, stick with decyphering the social commentary he puts in some  of his songs (the ones that aren't strickly commercial).	1999-07-25

Pet Sematary: now that was a great King book. The Bachman Books are hard to beat. Rose Madder was excellent. But then comes Bag of Bones and this. King has lost his old  charm and writing skill in the persuit of something more literary, and it  is causing me to stick with his old stuff and other authors. The only  reason I finished this book was that I listened to it on audio, and even  then it was a struggle. I am a fan of Stephen King, not Jack London. ... it belongs in Young Adult Adventure. Well, I guess I am left to  reading the old King and hoping that some day he'll come back in his former  glory.	1999-07-03

I laughed, I cried, and I laughed  and cried at the same time. The characters are very obscure--making me  wonder what disfunctional people surround the author--and this only makes  them more loveable and funny. As the end of the book approached I was  caught up in not wanting it to end, and wanting to see how it ends.  <br />&quot;In the world according to Garp, we're all terminal  cases.&quot;<br />WARNING: I noticed while reading other customer reviews,  that this book was poorly reviewed by a select few people. If you lack a  sense of humor, are offended by making light of the suffering of others in  the name of social commentary, or are simply low on inteligence, read  something else.	1999-06-27
