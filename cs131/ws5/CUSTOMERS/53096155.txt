She also has a dog.  If you're interested in what goes through the mind of an irrelevant middle-aged never-married childless academic, this is the book for you.  The dog isn't a very complete character and he is cruelly prevented from doing the things that dogs like to do, e.g., socialize with other dogs.<br /><br />If you want to read a great book in a similar genre, try Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie.  No dog in that one but she won the Pulitzer Prize (deservedly).	2005-09-27

I've been to a few of the places discussed in 1491 (Massachusetts, where Mann talks about the various tribes vying for power and how that played in English hands; Cahokia; Peru, where Mann draws on research from the last 30 years to paint a picture of a culture from 3500 B.C.) and did some research before and during these visits but this book taught me a lot of new facts.  This isn't too surprising because a lot of the relevant discoveries are going on right now and Mann talks about important archaeological work first reported in 2003, for example.<br /><br />This book will be great for young people who are interested in learning what it is like to be a archaeologist, anthropologist, or biologist engaged in debates over ambiguous data.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any curious person living in or visiting the Americas.	2005-08-26

You might think that the hotel and restaurant recommendations wouldn't be so useful considering the years that have elapsed since its publication.  Japan isn't like the US, however.  A restaurant does not rise and fall as employees are hired and leave.  In the smaller towns the better restaurants have often been run by the same family for several generations.  Ditto for the Japanese-style inns (ryokans).  Where you might wish for a more recent guide is when looking for a business hotel with in-room Internet.  Here the newest hotels are often the most comfortable.<br /><br />If you're traveling by train this is the only guidebook that you'll need.  If you're renting a car you might want to add the Lonely Planet book just for the maps.	2004-08-22

This book has some reasonable hotel recommendations, even at the higher end of the price scale, but it is hard to understand how the authors of the book picked restaurants.  At one Lonely Planet favorite I was served a soggy tuna sandwich that might have been found in England circa 1950.  A place in Sapporo billed as serving \\"authentic Indian food\\" had nothing on the menu that I recognized from Indian restaurants in the U.S., England, or India.  Finally the only restaurant in Japan where I managed to get food poisoning was a Lonely Planet suggestion.<br /><br />Good on hotels, however, and the maps are helpful once you get into a city or region.	2004-08-17

This is like one of those trashy \\"sex and shopping\\" novels but without the sex.  And the shopping isn't very interesting either, being mostly for stuff that was worth buying in the early 1990s such as a Machintosh laptop computer.  The main premise of the book seems pointless.  Some people make videos that they want to release anonymously on the Internet.  Instead of doing the obvious thing of transferring from camcorder to PC and offering on some peer-to-peer network they hire the one company in the world that can add some coded info down in the noise and then stick the filmmaker's email address into the footage.  Ignoring the fact that this idea goes back about 50 years, why would someone who wanted to remain anonymous do this?  Gibson never explains that.<br /><br />The book also talks about traveling to London, Tokyo, and Moscow.  None of this seems relevant to the story, all of which could just as easily been set in Indiana.  Maybe putting it in enabled the author to deduct some airfares and hotel stays.  There is a lot of stuff about brand names in the book, some of which might impress a peasant who had recently moved to Shanghai to work at Pizza Hut.	2004-08-17

This is a pretty good guidebook.  One area where the guide could be improved is advising tourists on itineraries that work up to high altitude gradually.  The easiest trips to arrange go straight from Lima at sea level to sleeping in a hotel in Cusco at 11,000' above sea level.  At best you won't feel good and at worst you could get acute altitude sickness.  A bit of planning, however, and you can either zip straight from the airport at Cusco to Aguas Calientes below Macchu Pichu (about 8000') or work your way up to Cusco from some towns that are at 7000'.  Simply by reshuffling your itinerary you can have a trip where you are feeling good and strong all the time rather than a trip where you stagger around breathlessly and suck down aspirin for the pounding headache.	2004-07-17

Clinton talks about this animal and how he freed it in a river before moving to Washington, DC.  He talks about his family and their struggles with obesity and alcohol and cocaine addiction.  He talks about stopping at McDonald's for coffee towards the end of his morning jog back in Arkansas.  He talks about some of the things that he did while President.  What he doesn't talk about is whether, given the distance of a decade, these things turned out good or bad.<br />One thing that I took away from the book is Clinton's belief that he was the best-qualified person for whatever job he was seeking.  Perhaps this is why we've had so many presidents from small towns in obscure states and surprisingly few from big cities.  If you grow up as the only smart person in a tiny school you might subconsciously believe for the rest of your life that you ought to be elected governor, president, whatever.  If, on the other hand, you grow up in Manhattan you might remember \\"hey, there were a bunch of folks in my old neighborhood who knew a lot more than I did and would probably do a better job.\\"  This might tend to sap your confidence.<br />If you have the stamina to wade through 1000 pages of minutia you still won't learn anything about government, foreign policy, or management.  On the other hand if you're upset at our current president it might be good to read this book and realize that George W. has no monpoly on mediocrity.	2004-07-12

She does not mention Katmai National Park (where you can get up close and personal with bears catching salmon) or any of the other places that an Alaska resident might recommend.  In the case of Massachusetts she recommends Legal Seafoods.

Many of the most important actors in the book were surprisingly old considering the hardships that they endured.  For example, Pizarro himself was 60 when he started heading down towards Peru through terrible storms in wooden boats, often getting stranded in mosquito-infested jungles without food for months at a time.  He was 65 by the time he actually conquered Peru.  One of the Pizarro family's most effective generals in their fights against other Spaniards was 80-84 during the period of these civil wars.<br />This book makes a great gift for anyone traveling to Ecuador or Peru and for anyone over the age of 60.	2004-05-18

The multi-generational family story is nicely crafted and the author, despite being a young person, writes convincingly about a 59-year-old man's concerns.  It would have been nice if the author had taken the time to have a licensed pilot review the manuscript.  The portions of the book that deal with actual flying bear no relationship to reality.  The main character, supposedly a fair-weather pilot, proceeds into clouds off the Connecticut coast instead of simply landing at one of the numerous airports that dot the shore or turning around and spending the night in the Boston area.  The author notes that these clouds are not thunderstorms and yet the little plane is nearly ripped apart by turbulence.  The pilot of the stricken airplane calls the control tower of his intended destination for an instrument clearance, rather than the nearby Providence Approach, which owns the airspace in which he was flying.  The tower controller in the book gives the main character a clearance that requires him to follow the Long Island Expressway, which would be a neat trick if you were stuck in the clouds (in the real world pilots on an instrument flight plan fly from one radio beacon to the next).  The grand finale is an instrument approach to a runway covered in fog, a heroic emergency maneuver that you would never attempt if you had a working airplane and enough fuel to fly another few minutes to an airport where the runway was not covered in fog.<br />If you're not an airplane nerd, however, you'll probably enjoy the book.	2004-04-24

The differences between the book and the movie are remarkable as other reviewers have noted but if you liked the movie that makes the book all the more interesting.<br />The book is set in the Hamptons and New York.  The protagonist, Schmidt, is a 60-year-old WASP lawyer who retires from his law firm partnership when his wife becomes terminally ill.  The wife is from an old rich WASP family and works as a literary fiction editor.  Schmidt's daughter, a Harvard-educated yuppie who does PR for a tobacco company, is planning to marry a junior partner at Schmidt's old firm.  This horrifies Schmidt partly because his future son-in-law doesn't read books or appreciate culture but mostly because the young lawyer is Jewish.  Much of the book centers on Schmidt's horror at a formerly genteel world of New York law firms and Long Island beaches, now despoiled by an influx of Jews.  The last half of the book is devoted to a romance between Schmidt and a 20-year-old half-Puerto Rican waitress, complete with a Hollywood happy ending.<br />The screenplay transplants the action to Omaha, Nebraska.  Schmidt and his wife are middle class salt-of-the-earth types.  There are no Jews in evidence.  The daughter is living 1000 miles away and her future husband is objectionable to Schmidt because he's a &quot;nincompoop&quot; and his family, rather than being successful happily married Jewish psychiatrists, consists of divorced white trash-y New Age-y folks.  The movie Schmidt, played by Jack Nicholson, is unrelievedly sad and pathetic.  There are no romances with young women for movie Schmidt (no romances with any women, actually).<br />Maybe we should give Hollywood for making a movie that is substantially darker than an already fairly dark novel.	2004-03-12

There are also long stories about the escapades of his 13-year-old son.<br />Never does the author address the issues raised in the subtitle, e.g., how does a person balance his or her life between charity and selfishness?

The pictures are pretty but the choice of subjects seems random and there is no consistency to the altitudes chosen.  Some photos could have been taken from a crane or a very low-flying helicopter; others from quite high up.  I like to fly in small airplanes in order to see how glaciers connect to rivers connect to oceans, for example.  The photos in this book, by contrast, are very disorienting.	2003-04-04

The maps are extremely detailed for towns and roads and such, especially in Western countries.  The DK Great World Atlas, however, has far more interesting information about geology and day/night satellite photos that give you a much better idea of what the world is really all about.  If I were getting a gift for a student, the DK atlas would be my choice (and it is about half the price of the Times atlas).	2003-04-02

This DK atlas devotes many of its pages to physical geography, inset explanations of interesting phenomena (e.g., Niagara Falls), and satellite photos.  The night-time satellite photos are very useful because they show population density.  The Great World Atlas is nice for planning trips, figuring out whether a potential vacation spot is near interesting geographical features such as a group of hills, and thinking about regions of the world.<br />This book would make a fabulous gift because of its lavish printing.	2003-04-02

The risks of flying over unfamiliar territory, without intermediate weather reports, in the pre-GPS days are astonishing.  The book starts off weak, with a lot of psychobabblish pondering that is unlikely to appeal to the pilots for whom the latter portion of the book will be interesting.  Beautifully printed and bound.

Even after reading the whole book you don't get a sense for what are the nicest destinations.  This is important because a lot of Baja destinations are popular for people with a passion for a particular activity and if you don't enjoy that activity you'll probably feel trapped there.<br />Tip:  If you must go to Cabo, avoid Cabo San Lucas and the Corridor and stay in San Jose del Cabo (a real Mexican town closer to the airport).

If you want to learn the names of every person who ever worked at GE during Jack Welch's 40 years there, you'll find this book invaluable.  If you want to learn something about what made GE successful, however, good luck picking out the few saplings of wisdom from the thick forest of names.<br />Golf and tennis fans will also find the book fascinating for its endless catalog of golf and tennis resorts nationwide.  Apparently being anywhere near the top at GE requires moving to Fairfield, Connecticut and aping the Lifestyles of the Bland and WASPy.<br />One interesting thing I learned is that GE went from 0 percent employee ownership to 31 percent during Jack Welch's tenure as CEO, primarily through granting of stock options to top managers such as Jack himself.  Jack doesn't talk about this except to say that he's proud of the number.  He doesn't get into the question of whether the investors from 1980 are happy now that they own less than 70 percent of the company.  Nor does he talk about what would have happened to GE's earnings if they'd accounted for all of these stock options at time of issue.<br />The useful and interesting content in this book could have been presented in 75 pages if the editors and ghostwriter had been doing their jobs.  But they weren't doing their jobs.  So the readers all have to &quot;give 110 percent&quot; or &quot;give 1000 percent&quot;.  Maybe this is what Jack Welch wanted because he uses these expressions numerous times throughout Straight from the Gut.	2002-04-15

Most of the houses in the neighborhood were built in the 1960s. They lie low against the forested hills. Many of the 1960s houses can barely be seen from the street, despite the quarter-acre lot sizes and the fact that most of the houses are 4-bedroom affairs. Returning to this neighbor (Mohican Hills) today, one's senses are assaulted by the 1990s houses. The builders razed the trees and pushed the foyer roof as high as possible. The new houses have perhaps twice the interior space as the old ones but 10 times the visual impact.  Kramer's well-written, smoothly flowing book is about the same phenomenon on Cape Cod and how a representative couple of old-style Cape residents deal with it.<br />Caveat: It feels as though the psychiatrist author mined his patients' collective neuroses to build the characters in this book.

The ideas are familiar: &quot;Money is to the fore now. It is the romance, the poetry of our age. It's the thing that chiefly strikes the imagination. The Englishmen who come here are more curious about the great new millionaires than about any one else, and they respect them more.&quot; (Rise of Silas Lapham)<br />My favorite section from The Rise of Silas Lapham:  &quot;This comes of the error which I have often deprecated,&quot; said the elder Corey. &quot;In fact I am always saying that the Bostonian ought never to leave Boston. Then he knows--and then only--that there can be no standard but ours. But we are constantly going away, and coming back with our convictions shaken to their foundations. One man goes to England, and returns with the conception of a grander social life; another comes home from Germany with the ntion of a more searching intellectual activity; a fellow just back from Paris has the absurdest ideas of art and literature; and you revert to us from the cowboys of Texas, and tell us to our faces that we ought to try Papa Lapham by a jury of his peers. It ought to be stopped--it ought, really. The Bostonian who leaves Boston ought to be condemned to perpetual exile.&quot;<br />If these novels lack the genius of Edith Wharton or Henry James they provide a much more realistic view of American life circa 1880.  You might not learn as much about the interior of the human heart but you'll learn something about how people got from place to place, furnished their houses, and managed businesses.	2001-08-05

Berkeley professor who quotes from the AP wire to reinforce the difference between soft-rayed and spiny-rayed fish:<br />&quot;... when I read the headline to an article in ... the San Francisco Chronicle (1 April 1997), I knew both it was not an April Fool's Day joke and that the fish was most likely a cichlid, and it was.<br />Man Chokes on Tropical Fish<br />Bayou Visa, La.  Stephen Hill Epperson, 36, popped a friend's 6-inch tropical fish into his mouth as a joke Sunday<br />and died when it got stuck in his throat.  The Jack Dempsey fish  became wedged in Epperson's airway, said Dr. F.H. Metz, coroner  for St. Mary Parish.<br />The Jack Dempsey is indeed a cichlid and performed the typical response of a spiny-rayed fish when engulfed by a predator: It locked its fine spines in the upright position to thwart being swallowed. Had the fish been a soft-rayed fish, such as the goldfish that have so often been safely gulped down by college students, the unfortunate Mr. Epperson would still be alive.&quot;<br />  Cichlids are freshwater fish that provide parental care for their children. They are among the most intelligent of fish. Among the thousands of species of cichlids, it is possible to find behavior that is familiar to students of human psychology. There are cichlid fathers that stay with the wife and kids when times are tough but desert to find a new mate if predation levels are low enough that the female and his offspring by her can survive on their own (cf. American ghetto life after Aid to Families with Dependent Children).<br />If you decide to skim the book, make sure to read the last chapter carefully. It contains some important ideas about human impact on ecology.	2001-08-04

I was disappointed on both counts.  Preece has a long section on online education but misses a main advantage:  new opportunities for people to teach (the offline world already has a lot of opportunities for learning at any time of day or night).  Preece talks about what she calls &quot;technology&quot;.  The mention of VRML in a book published in 2000 will please nostalgia buffs.  But there is no discussion of the role of the relational database management system.  Preece uncritically quotes various scholars of the female experience online, dwelling on the alleged fact that revealing oneself to be a woman is a passport to ill treatment (in fact, our experience on photo.net is that women who ask questions are answered more promptly and treated more gently if they violate community norms such as &quot;search before you post&quot;).<br />You'll learn a lot more from surfing the Web site of Amitai Etzioni, the world's leading offline communitarian sociologist, than from reading this book.	2001-04-21

Western Union &quot;insisted that its monopoly [on US telegraphy] was in everyone's interest, even if it was unpopular, because it would encourage standardization.&quot;  Today's high-pressure startups have nothing on Thomas Edison who &quot;locked his workforce in the workshop until they had finished building a large order of stock tickers.&quot;  As with the Web, the true inventor, Samuel Morse, made &quot;a respectable sum, though less than the fortunes amassed by the entrepreneurs who built empires on the back of his invention.&quot;  Standage pairs modern pundits such as Nicholas Negroponte predicting that the Internet will bring about world peace with their 19th century equivalents predicting that the telegraph will enable a perfect understanding between governments and peoples and bring an end to wars.  If you made big bucks in the dotcom world of the 1990s, page 205 may cause you a moment's reflection:<br />&quot;The heyday of the telegrapher as a highly paid, highly skilled information worker was over; telegraphers' brief tenure as members of an elite community with master over a miraculous, cutting-edge technology had come to an end.

Netscape plus bonuses	I met Charles once or twice in and around MIT (he was a grad student in political science; I was/am in the engineering school).  So I can vouch for the other reviewers' comments that Charles isn't Mr. Smooth.  Nor do I give the book 4 stars because he seems likely to displace Seamus Heaney as a poet.  But you'll never see a clearer explanation of how hired-gun CEOs can run a company into the ground.  The bigger and most interesting example of this phenomenon covered in the book is Netscape.  In ancient times it was believed that you had to train people for 5 or 10 years before they could assume significant management responsibility within a company.  Jack Welch started at GE in 1961.

Previous authors limited themselves to the lives of the nobility.  Stick is remarkable for the unremarkable nature of its characters:  small-time crooks, the hired help, the women who hang around money, one yuppie, and one aspiring yuppie.

The research is thorough, as you might expect from an author who is &quot;Professor of Renaissance Studies&quot;.  But the book touches on all kinds of scientific advances and technology that would be interesting if explained.  Jardine mentions the introduction of the ruby bearing for chronometers.  But she doesn't explain or illustrate the jewelled watch movement.  By contrast I've watched Gerry Sussman, an MIT EECS professor, hold an audience spellbound with a clear explanation of what the 17 jewels in a 17-jewel watch movement do.  Next time Jardine writes about science, I hope that she collaborates with an engineer or scientist and an illustrator.	2001-03-21

You'll be informed and your table manners won't offend your Thai hosts (they use forks and spoons but not the way that we do).  More photos and maps would be nice (the D-K guide to Thailand will fill those gaps).  But the big shortcoming with the book is the subject itself:  Bangkok.  Sophisticated and curious travelers to Thailand always say that their favorite spot is Chiang Mai in the north!  You've got to fly through Bangkok to get there so you still may want to carve out a week to see Bangkok and environs.  But do try to get to the north (Parkes also wrote the Moon Thailand Handbook, which will be useful if you do decide to visit Chiang Mai).	2001-03-21

The book is beautifully written, even when describing Vinnie Miner, 54-year-old female English professor, settling in for the flight to London: &quot;In this culture, where energy and egotism are rewarded in the young and good-looking, plain aging women are supposed to be self-effacing, uncomplaining--to take up as little space and breathe as little air as possible.  All very well, she thinks, if you travel with someone dear to you or at least familiar:  someone who will help you stow away your coat, tuck a pillow behind your head, find you a newspaper--or if you choose, converse with you.<br />But what of those who travel alone?  Why should Vinnie Miner, whose comfort has been disregarded by others for most of her adult life, disregard her own comfort?  Why should she allow her coat, hat, and belongings to be crushed by the coats and hats and belongings of<br />younger, larger, handsomer persons?  Why should she sit alone for seven or eight hours, pillowless and chilled, reading an outdated copy of _Punch_, with her feet swollen and her pale amber eyes watering from the smoke of the cigarette fiends in the adjoining seats?&quot;<br />Much ink is spent on the life of the plain woman, notably the plain middle-aged woman:<br />&quot;Within the last couple of years she has in a sense caught up with, even passed, some of her better-equipped contemporaries.  The comparison of her appearance to that of other women of her age is no longer a constant source of mortification.  she is no better looking than she ever was, but they have lost more ground. ... Her features have not taken on the injured, strained expression of the former beauty, nor does she paint and decorate and simper and coo in a desperate attempt to arouse the male interest she feels to be her due.  She is not consumed with rage and grief at the cessation of attentions that were in any case moderate, undependable, and intermittent.  As a result men--even men she has been intimate with--do not now gaze upon her with dismay, as upon a beloved landscape devastated by fire, flood, or urban development. ...&quot;<br />Lurie is also very sharp on tourism:  &quot;His earlier anomie, Fred realizes now, was occupational. Psychologically speaking, tourists are disoriented, ghostly beings; they walk London's streets and enter its buildings in a thin ectoplasmal form, like a double-exposed photograph.  London isn't real to them, and to Londoners they are equally unreal--pale, featureless, two-dimensional figures who clog up the traffic and block the view.&quot;rate, undependable, and intermittent.

His books just keep getting more savage regarding the persecutors of the oppressed (i.e., tenured professors of English).  If you've been fed on a diet of genteel novels of academia, the ending may shock you.  Still, you have to love a guy who imagines a textbook publisher taking over a university and changing the motto from &quot;Sapienta prima stultitia caruisse&quot; to &quot;If We Don't Teach iIt, You Don't Need to Know It.&quot;<br />I kind of wish that Hynes will return to the territory he explored in the first story of Publish and Perish:  the dual-academic marriage where one partner is more successful than the other, the geographical split due to the scarcity of jobs.

And yet hard-to-use computer systems are still produced.  I read this book.  A few months later someone else told me that I should hand out a chapter to my students at MIT.  I made a note to myself to check out this book, having completely forgotten that I'd read it.  In fact, it was sitting on a shelf right behind my desk chair!<br />One reason that this book won't have much impact is that it is not available on the Web.  Thus university students worldwide will be unlikely to encounter it (professors only assign hardcopy books that can function as a textbook for an entire semester of a standard subject).  So the next generation of engineers will be unaware of Raskin's restatement of user interface principles.<br />A deeper reason why this book won't have much impact is that it usually requires a working system to get an idea across.  For example, a lot of people learned about good UI by using the Apple Macintosh, not by reading the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines (though that book was/is extremely lucid).<br />Bottom line:  a book on usability that, because it isn't on the Web and isn't organized as a full-term text, isn't usable by 99% of the people who'd be best able to use it.	2001-02-14

So he writes about the personalities of the people involved in the resurgence of chaos theory during the past few decades.  Unfortunately, many of the people profiled are tenured faculty at big universities.  Most of them don't really have personalities.  Gleick will write about these guys facing oppression from skeptical colleagues.  As the pages unfold it turns out that the &quot;oppression&quot; consists of their colleagues, who are working in unrelated areas, being unmotivated to spend hours looking at line-printer output.  A further element of the &quot;oppression&quot; that adds drama to Gleick's book is a lifetime guaranteed salary, an office with a nice view, and funding for some graduate students plus computers.<br />You'd learn more science by reading through a stack of old New Yorker magazines...	2001-01-30

The Web is about 10 years old.  In the early days it required an unusually talented software engineer to build a working dynamic Web service.  Now the knowledge of how to build database-backed Web sites is fairly well distributed.  You can adopt the Microsoft religion.  You can adopt the Oracle religion.  You can adopt the open source religion.  Whatever you choose your users will probably get back a page full of HTML (or WML if they are on a WAP phone).<br />If the software engineering aspects of Web service design have gotten easier, what about usability?  It has gotten much harder.  Mark Hurst of Creative Good has a nice graph showing how in 1993 and 1994 the average Web site was very simple to use and the average user was a hardcore Unix weenie working in a university research lab.  Whereas in 2000 the average Web site has almost the complexity of a desktop app and the average user is new to computers.  Hurst calls this the &quot;user experience gap&quot;.  The questions that Nielsen raises are the important ones, by and large.  Does he have all of the answers packed into 419 pages?  No.  The field is too broad for any one person or any one book to be comprehensive.  But this book is another important contribution by a guy who has been taking these issues seriously for more than a decade.	2000-11-07

Here's what I wrote...<br />As it happens, I wasn't the only PowerBook addict in camp. Ted Kerasote, a writer for Sports Afield and Outside magazines, was here writing about bear management. We happened to  be sitting next to each other around the lodge fireplace and he'd already  heard all about me.<br />  &quot;You must be that guy from Boston.&quot;<br />  Ted beautifully illustrated the mellowing effect that living in a Wyoming  town of 90 for years can have on someone born on the Lower East Side. In a  patient soft voice, Ted summarized his new book Bloodties, about animal  rights and hunting.<br />  &quot;Hunting in one's bioregion can be  ecologically more sound than being a supermarket fossil-fuel vegetarian,  i.e., someone who has plugged-into America's factory farm system which has  destroyed so many different types of wildlife. Remember that the wheat  field used to be a buffalo range, pesticides kill animals, and combines  kill all kinds of small animals. Exploration for the oil that powers the  combines and makes the pesticides displaces and kills animals.&quot;<br />  What about Prudhoe Bay? It is only a 250-square-mile outpost on the Arctic  Ocean and produces all of Alaska's oil. With millions of square miles of  identical wilderness all around, how could this tiny settlement make a  difference?<br />  &quot;Good point, but think about the Dalton Highway that  was built to service Prudhoe Bay. That opened up those millions of square  miles of wilderness to hunters who go in and kill moose and wolves.<br />  &quot;My book calculates the fossil-fuel cost of different diets. A guy in  Wyoming expends 79,000 K-calories to shoot 150 lbs of elk meat. The  equivalent amount of Idaho potatoes costs 150,000 K-cals. Rice and beans  from Northern California 477,000 K- cals.&quot;<br />  That's great, but I  hadn't seen too many elk roaming around my Boston suburb, whereas we are  well-supplied with supermarkets. Can a significant number of Americans  really live off game?<br />  &quot;There are more white-tail deer now than  when Columbus landed because the forest has been opened up and they  flourish on the edge of timber land.&quot;<br />  [Reviews of Ted's book  spoke volumes about the difference between East and West Coasts.

University administration grows even when faculty size remains  constant (at MIT, the administrator-to-faculty ratio doubled in the  20 years from 1969 to 1989). The obvious result is a rise in the  cost of university education.  The less obvious result is that university  administrations begin to do  all kinds of things that they aren't  qualified to do. Kors and  Silverglate focus on administrators limiting  freedom of speech,  starting with rules that are poorly drafted and  ending with internal  court systems that afford defendants very few  rights.<br />  The famous University of Pennsylvania &quot;water  buffalo&quot; case is  here. MIT puts in a fairly impressive showing,  notably our decision  to pay administrators to watch porn movies to  decide whether  they were obscene. Under this policy, proposed in 1984,  Dean  James Tewhey prosecuted an MIT undergrad for showing Deep  Throat, a film held by the Massachusetts courts to be acceptable  under  Cambridge's community standards. Under MIT rules, the  undergrad, Adam  Dershowitz, was not entitled to legal  representation before the MIT  Committee on Discipline (COD).  However, he could bring a relative, so  he asked his uncle, Alan  Dershowitz, to come down the street from  Harvard Law School.  This resulted in an acquittal for young Dershowitz  and some  changes in MIT policy. COD hearings would no longer be open  to  the student press, students would no longer be entitled to bring a  relative, and it would henceforth be forbidden to tape-record  proceedings.<br />  [Note: Tewhey is actually my favorite MIT  administrator of all time  because, after years of giving students  lectures on how to run their  romantic lives, his own affair with  another MIT employee turned  sour. They were both married (to other  people). She accused him  of following her around and harassing her.  They both got  restraining orders from the Massachusetts courts against  each  other. She asked MIT to fire him for harassing her. With about as  much due process as Tewhey had ever given any of the students,  MIT fired him. Or we said that we did. But then it turned out that  we  were paying him for not working for about a year after we'd  allegedly  fired him. And then he sued MIT in Middlesex Superior  Court for  wrongful discharge. And then we sort of lost track of  James Tewhey.]<br />  Kors is a scholar and Silverglate is a civil rights lawer. So the  book differs from what a journalist might have written in the  provision of philosophical and legal underpinnings for all of the  newsworthy cases. Most interestingly, the roots of speech limits on  campus are traced back to Herbert Marcuse (the only philosopher  ever  to appear on the cover of TIME Magazine). Marcuse argued  that as long  as society was oppressed by the powerful, free  speech does not help  the weak. True toleration and liberation  could only be achieved by  withdrawing &quot;toleration of speech and  assembly from groups and  movements which promote aggressive  policies, armament, chauvinism,  discrimination on the gorunds of  race and religion, or which oppose  the extension of public  services, social security, medicare care,  etc.&quot;<br />  I was recommending the book to a friend and she asked  &quot;Who is  it written for?&quot; We thought about it for awhile. It  can't be the  administrators because they presumably enjoy the status  quo. It  can't be the students because they are just passing through  the  university in order to pick up a credential. It can't be the  professors because they've mostly abdicated control of the  university  to the administrators. Most faculty see themselves either  as employees  of a bureaucracy vastly more powerful than  themselves or as low-grade  autonomous entrepreneurs only  loosely connected to the university.<br />  In fact, there might not be anyone in the United States whose has  both the power and the inclination to redress any of the wrongs  outlined in the 400 pages of The Shadow University. That is a  thought  much scarier than any in the book itself.rade  autonomous entrepreneurs only      loosely connected to the university. <br />      In fact, there might not be anyone in the United States whose has       both the power and the inclination to redress any of the wrongs       outlined in the 400 pages of The Shadow University.

Written because Graves was out of money and threw in everythingfrom his life that he thought would make the book sell (e.g.,anecdotes about T.E. Lawrence), this is a great book for understandingthe terrible gulf that separates a public's enthusiasm for war and a soldier's actual experience of war. Trench warefare in World War I is different from a ground war in Kosovo but the basic idea is the same: a bunch of old guys in suits lead a cheering public to send their young men off to die. What is a clear-cut moral case to someone reading a newspaper at the breakfast table isn't so clear-cut to two 18-year-olds who are supposed to try to kill each other in the field.<br /> The book also has some interesting portions about the life of a poet and a writer (hint: don't try it unless you were born rich and aristocratic) and a particularly funny anecdote about how Oxford wouldn't accept a thesis from Graves because it was not written in standard academic style.	2000-04-30

The trilogy itself is an inspiring  artifact of a life spent  working hard. Galsworthy finished the first  book, Man of Property in  1906, at the age of 39. He put the  project aside for something like 12  years and then finished the last  two novels when in his mid-50s.

My favorite part of the book is the capsule  biography in the back. He  drops out of high school (like me!) and  alters his transcript to get  into Tufts. He flunks out of Tufts but gets  hold of a transcript for  another Nathan Weinstein, who was  apparently a pretty good student. He  uses this to get into Brown  and becomes an Ivy League graduate in  1924.<br />  Oh yes, the writing... West's prose could easily pass for a  New  Yorker story circa 1985. Furthermore, his characters behave a lot  like our contemporaries. None of this struck me as remarkable but  I think it accounts for why he was so widely admired by good  writers  of his day and so roundly ignored by readers during the  1930s (perhaps  6,000 copies of his books were sold during his  lifetime). Even if his  writing style hadn't been so modern, releasing  the bleak Miss  Lonelyhearts in 1933 cannot have been an  inspired marketing idea (the  publisher went bankrupt just as the  book was released).<br />  If you  want to read just one West novel, my personal choice  would be Day of  the Locust (1939), his last work. It is about the  people destroyed by  their dreams of California and Hollywood,  seen through the eyes of a  journeyman studio artist. He's obsessed  with an aspiring actress, Faye  Greener: &quot;Her invitation wasn't to  pleasure, but to struggle,  hard and sharp, closer to murder than to  love. If you threw yourself  on her, it would be like throwing  yourself from the parapet of a  skyscraper. You would do it with a  scream. You couldn't expect to rise  again. Your teeth would be  driven into your skull like nails into a  pine board and your back  would be broken. You wouldn't even have time  to sweat or close  your eyes.&quot;<br />  The strangest novel in the  collection is A Cool Million, wherein a  Candide-like young man, Lemuel  Pitkin, goes out to make his  fortune in what a variety of Panglosses  keep telling him is the Land  of Opportunity.

Don't read it for the  plot!<br />  &quot;Unmarried men in their forties, if we don't subside entirely into the  landscape, often lose important credibility and can even attract  unwholesome attention in a small, conservative community. And in  Haddam, in my new circumstances, I felt I was perhaps becoming  the  personage I least wanted to be and, in the years since my  divorce, had  feared being: the suspicious bachelor, the man whose  life has no  mystery, the graying, slightly jowly, slightly too tanned  and trim  middle-ager, driving around town in a cheesy '58 Chevy  ragtop polished  to a squeak, always alone on balmy summer  nights, wearing a faded  yellow polo shirt and green suntans, elbow  over the window top,  listening to progressive jazz, while smiling  and pretending to have  everything under control, when in fact there  was nothing to  control.&quot;<br />  I think that with those two sentences, Ford managed  to say what  his book was about.

Nearly every one of this volume's 1170  pages will make you question an assumption that you probably  didn't realize you were  making. In a section entitled &quot;Four-Story  Limit&quot;, Alexander  notes that &quot;there is abundant evidence to show  that high  buildings make people crazy.&quot; Underneath is a photo of  San  Franisco's Transamerica tower, captioned with a quote from  Orwell's  1984:<br />  &quot;The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak--was  startlingly different from any other object in sight. It  was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering  white concrete,  soaring up terrace after terrace 300  metres in the air.&quot;<br />  Alexander backs up this polemic with convincing arguments that  high-rise living removes people too far from the casual society of  the  street, from children playing in the yard, and that  apartment-dwellers  therefore become isolated.<br />  Alexander spends a lot of time in this  book trying to figure out how  to restore the damage to our communities  that have been done by  automobiles. He argues for better public spaces  and for more  integration of children, old people, and workers. He  argues for  more access to water by more people.<br />  Many of  Alexander's arguments are against the scale of modern  systems. Public  schools spend a fortune on building and  administration precisely  because they are so physically large [I've  seen statistics showing  that our cities spend only about one-third of  their budgets on  classrooms and teachers]. If we had shopfront  schools and fired all  the school system personnel who don't teach,  we might be able to get  student-teacher ratios down to 8 or 10:1  without an increase in cost.  Similarly, Alexander argues for smaller  retail shops, smaller  factories (or at least identifiable small  workgroups within factories  rather than hundreds of faceless cogs)  and more master/apprentice  instruction.<br />  What if you like the depredations of modernity and  aren't  interested in a utopian world where basic human needs are met?

As there were over 600 Smiths who died in Vietnam and 16 James Joneses, an alphabetical listing would have given the memorial the flavor of a telephone directory.<br /> Tufte persuasively argues and demonstrates how graphic design and information presentation affects thinking, decision-making, and emotion.	1998-03-19

The notion that technology can supplant incompetence is upon us in all sorts of endeavors, including that of shooting.&quot;<br />  A gun nerd friend of mine told me I had to read the book.  I don't have any guns and I don't shoot so I frankly didn't find the information very useful.  On the other hand, you have to admire this guy's fanaticism taking his granddaughters to Africa to blast away at Zebras.  If he were a programmer, he'd be using Common Lisp.<br />  Anyway, I found the book valuable because of the above quote.  People who run Web projects and think they can make up for their unwillingness to hire competent programmers by buying junkware/middleware need to read this.	1998-01-19

This involved writing a Perl program to parse the Web Blade syntax and then generate Tcl with the appropriate AOLserver API calls.  I didn't have the BNF for the Web Blade language and didn't particularly feel like figuring it out.  Reading _Mastering Regular Expressions_ enabled me to hack this out pretty painlessly in Perl in a day or two.  Probably saved the client $10,000 in  programmer time.<br /> Jeffrey Friedl would say that you're supposed to read it from cover-to-cover but I think that you can benefit by pulling it out in emergencies.<br />  Anyway, I had to pick four O'Reilly titles to give away every month from and this book was the first that came to my mind.<br />  Why doesn't this book get a 10?  Because in a world with _Anna Karenina_, I don't think any computer trade book deserves a 10!  END	1997-11-04

People would not put it down.  They were grinning like 4-year-olds with a new fire engine.<br /><br />The printing quality is superb and the included magnifying glass lets you zoom down to the finest detail in tiles.  The publisher has also broken out portions of each image so that you don't need the magnifying glass to appreciate the irony (e.g., a photo of Bill Gates formed out of scanned bank notes).<br /><br /> Nits:  as with so many photo books, the introductory and accompanying text is weak.  Intelligent writing about photography is rare (see [...] for my reviews of some writings by Sontag and John Szarkowski's introduction to a Winogrand monograph).  Photomosaics would be a better book if they'd chopped all the text and just shown the pictures.  But it is easy enough to ignore the text completely and become absorbed in the photos.  That's what my brunch guests did.  Then they all tried to figure out how to buy copies as gifts.	1997-08-18

But she does so much so well with a fairly simple idea that IMHO she deserves all the praise she's gotten in the dead trees media.  I read _Lives of the Monster Dogs_ while in the middle of writing a tech book for Macmillan (_Database Backed Web Sites_).  For weeks afterwards, I kicked myself for working on the Web book for nerds.  If I couldn't write as well as Bakis then at least I could try.  What was the point of churning out a tutorial when life is so short and art is so beautiful?<br /> Anyway, I sold out in the end and finished my tech book and haven't worked on my novel.  Here's what I wrote for my friends about Bakis's book...<br /> This is science fiction in the tradition of H.G. Wells  and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Written by a young woman  living in Manhattan, it is about a young woman  living in the Manhattan of the year 2009 when 150  dogs laden with jewels and gold arrive in the city  from a remote town in northwestern Canada. The  dogs have artifical hands and voiceboxes and,  because they are rich, are accepted to a large  degree by the human society. They end up with  fancy apartments, limousines, and human servants.  But happiness is more elusive. The book makes  you think about what it means to be an outsider.  Bakis has a convincing way of getting inside the  head of a dog (though her Malamute has blue eyes,  a disqualifying fault according to the AKC). One  great touch is that the future is exactly like the  present. Occasionally, Bakis has people talk  casually about a fabric or fashion that we don't  have. Otherwise, New York is exactly the same.  The poor and young roast in unairconditioned flats;  the rich (dogs or otherwise) cruise by in huge  limousines. Bakis gets bonus points for writing in a  Samoyed bitch who receives love poetry from a  scruffy mongrel.Samoyed bitch who receives love poetry from a      scruffy mongrel.	1997-07-06

Nonetheless, in 20 years of being a nerd, this is the only great book about computers that I've encountered.<br /><br /> If you're already a great programmer,<br /> it will take you an evening to read the first few chapters and you'll<br /> discover a precision vocabulary for discussing what you've spent 10<br /> years learning the hard way.  If you're not already a great programmer,<br /> I would have thought that these few chapters would save you from having<br /> to spend years flailing around in the dark.  Unfortunately, there<br /> doesn't seem to be a substitute for practical experience.<br /><br /> Sidenote: the authors used to have a review wall outside their offices<br /> at MIT.  University professors from around the world writing in<br /> scientific journals said &quot;finally I understand what all this computer<br /> science stuff is about; this is the most brilliant book ever.  I'm glad<br /> that we're using it to teach freshmen now.&quot;  In the center was a review<br /> from Byte magazine: &quot;I didn't understand any of this book.&quot;<br /><br /> SICP is tougher to read than _Teach Yourself to be a Dummy in 21<br /> Days_ but it is the real thing, well organized and written.<br /><br /> I shudder as I type this, but SICP can even help you write better Perl scripts...	1997-07-04

Their staffers, the &quot;Hill rats&quot;, are whores for receptions where the lobbyists buy shrimp.<br /> Every few pages, you learn about another perk the separates Congress from the rest of us. Maybe it is<br /> the IRS opening an office in the Cannon House Office Building to help members and staff prepare their<br /> taxes. Or perhaps the Congressionally-funded FAA traffic controller revoking the landing clearance of<br /> a commercial jet so that Congressman Ron Coleman (D-TX) wouldn't have to circle. I grew up in<br /> Washington, D.C., so I thought that I didn't have anything more to learn about politicians.
