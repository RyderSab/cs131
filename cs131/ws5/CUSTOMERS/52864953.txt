All the major landing spots are covered, & it gives an overview of the wildlife & where they're found.

Everything is covered here, from Gentoo Penguins to Crab-Eater Seals (which don't actually eat crabs). Beautiful illustrations make it easy to identify birds & other animals while your out on the ice. If you're going to the White Continent, you'll want to stash this little book in your daypack. This book was useful when my husband & I visited the Antarctic peninsula, which we chronicle in our DVD \\"T&T's Real Travels in Antarctica\\" (also available on amazon.com).	2005-07-03

It's not necessarily the best for planning a trip -- you'll get more up-to-date cruise ship info. online. But Lonely Planet will tell you all about the different possible landing spots, which can help you choose which tour to take. There's also good details about the most common embarkation points for Antarctica cruises.

Other guides & websites mention a few of the places, but this is the only book to collect all the info. in one place, & in a handy, travel-size book too. <br /> <br />However, Brodie's directions are often vague & incomplete. Maps would help, but simply including specifics like \\"drive 15km up the mountain & look for the DoC sign that says XYZ\\" would be just as useful. The current directions only say \\"drive up the road to the film location\\" or somesuch. This book really seems geared to people using GPS. <br /> <br />In NZ last week, I purchased the 'extended' version of this book, but I haven't had time to compare the text to see if it's been improved. However, the new version is a larger format, more of a coffee-table book, so it wouldn't be suitable to carrying on the road. Perhaps you could photocopy pages for traveling.	2004-11-30

The party tips are well-themed &amp; not cliched -- they're also geared towards adults, not kids. There's some unique decoration ideas here that will help make your party shine. The only problem is there are only a few photos in this book, &amp; they're black &amp; white so you can't see much detail. But the party suggestions are first-rate, &amp; not the same old stuff as in other books.	2002-07-24

So many halloween books are geared towards kids -- it's refreshing to find one aimed at adults. And adults with style, not just adults who like blood &amp; gore. This book has crafts &amp; decorations for a very elegant adult Halloween celebration. In these projects, skulls nestle among fall leaves &amp; flowers, candles glow dramatically, &amp; silken banners flutter in the wind. The photos are lavish, the instructions are clear, &amp; the projects require only basic tools &amp; sewing skills. I've been making Halloween decorations for years, but this book had beautiful new ideas I hadn't thought of &amp; that I hadn't found in other books.	2002-07-24

Very interesting reading if you're a fan of Sartre, Hemmingway, etc., &amp; the book has plenty about those writers' cafe haunts &amp; habits.

Rick Steves' books are ideal for independent travelers on a budget who want to get the most out of their time &amp; money. This book is for anyone who wants to experience the culture, history, &amp; modern fun of France. The accomodation &amp; food tips are step up from the grungy backpacker fare that the Let's Go series recommends, yet still modestly priced. Rick hits all the major tourist sites, but also shows you cozy, local spots where you can relax &amp; really get into the country. I recently used this book &amp; his more in-depth Paris book for 2 weeks in France &amp; found the books to be an ideal tour guide. I've used his other books for European trips, &amp; I'm never disappointed.	2002-05-01

This is Shakespeare thru the eyes of American pop culture with references to everything from Casablanca to Dr. Ruth to rap music. But it's not Shakespeare for dummies -- the RSC lads know the real texts inside &amp; out. They show Shakespeare's greatness thru their humor -- &amp; they remind us how funny Shakespeare really is. The RSC would be an excellent introduction to Shakespeare for students or anyone who thinks the Bard is stuffy &amp; boring.	2001-09-25

I used this book &amp; found several wonderful hikes that weren't mentioned in any of the other Kauai guide books. The best was the Waiema Canyon hike -- it wasn't a super-easy hike, but four of us (ranging in age from 25 to 50) did it in half a day. We had lunch by a beautiful hidden waterfall, &amp; during the hike we found spectacular views of the canyon. Recommended.	2001-05-24

It's very much geared towards wanna-be socialites in very large cities who have a lot of lovers, go to endless parties, &amp; have little or no career aspirations or long-term goals. The authors certainly know how to live with more flash than cash, but that life is a bit shallow &amp; ethically questionable IMO (esp. the &quot;use your company's expense account for your own fun&quot; tips -- not only could that get you in trouble, but how many people under 30 even *have* an expense account?). The book is an enjoyable read, breezy &amp; funny, but don't expect much in the way of usable advice.	2001-03-23
