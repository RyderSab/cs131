For the most part, this 7-disk set of CDs was just a plain joy to listen to.  I admire Dyer for attaining the level he has--considering his humble beginnings.  He also lets it all hang out in his presentations: singing, humming, repeating mantras, etc..  I felt a high level of peace, and did a lot of soul searching as I listened.  I highly recommend the CDs.  I don't know whether there's a book by this title or not.	2005-03-31

Wrong.  This book covers topics such as; \\"How To Tell a Story\\", \\"How To Give A Talk\\", etc..  Sure, these are important attributes, but... <br />The last of the 7 steps was, \\"Smile\\", yet he gave no advice on the subject.  Mr. Anderson is a wonderful writer, and yes, the steps he gives will further ones level of confidence, but there are better books.  I was looking through my collection of self-confidence books, and I came across a great one.  \\"I Dare You\\".  Now read that one.  This one is missing a lot.  Read it anyway.	2005-03-28

This method, along with truly excelling in what you do, is what it takes to advance your present status.  Look at celebrities such as George W. Bush, or any politician.  They have to point out their accomplishments or they would never get elected.  Is it wrong to brag?  Well, the word alone has negative connotations, yet used correctly, bragging is a very useful tool.  Kudos to Peggy Klaus for a book well written, and needed by so many of us wallflowers.  Remember, \\"success is when preparation and luck come together\\".  Bragging is an important step of preparation.  Read this book.  You'll be glad you did.	2005-03-14

If I would have started reading the book, I doubt I would have finished it.  What a great rags-to-riches story.  Bobby Unser has lived quite a life.  There is so much a person can learn about success by listening or reading about his adventures on, and off the track.  My only complaint is that many, if not most of the stories were repeated many times.  Other than that I highly recommend these tapes.  I enjoyed them.	2005-03-14

I guess once your rich you can get away with a lot.  I'm just glad I checked it out at the library!  If you are into new-age/metaphysical mumbo-jumbo you'll love this.  It reeked of \\"A Course in Miracles\\", and listening to Marc Allen reminded me a lot of Wayne Dyer (voice and monotone).  After trashing this work I will point out that the author did speak about prioritizing and acting on your dreams.  These two attributes alone should account for at least 3 stars.  I just found it boring, and am sick of authors like Marc Allen, Donald Trump, Robert Kiyosaki, Mark Fisher, Anthony Robbins, etc. throwing the word 'millionaire' or 'billionaire' into the title--just to trap the unaware.  I've listened to tons of the stuff, read the books and tried some of the methods.  I aint rich yet.  Hey, I've got an idea!

Sadly, while reading this book in the tub, I dozed off, and into the drink it went.  I blow-dried it best I could, and finished reading it--then threw it away.  This book is definitely dated, considering it was written long before the PC existed, yet the author put his heart and soul into it, and it shows.

Good choice.  Some time ago I started reading \\"Learned Optimism\\", also by Seligman.  I never finished reading it, even though it was an excellent book.  Authentic Happiness adresses the things in our lives that produce the most happiness as well as those things that bring us down.  One of the biggest insights for me, even though I've heard it and read it many times:  Don't work on or worry about your weaknesses, rather, increase your strengths!  This is a difficult assignment for a perfectionist.  Are you a \\"glass is half-full\\", or \\"half-empty\\" person?  Which ever you are, can you change?  Seligman brought a lot of deep, soul-searching questions into play.  He also offers a web-site including self-tests, to find out where you stand in the happiness line of life.  I don't know whether I'd ever read this book, however, I would like to listen to the audio program again.  Positive stuff!	2005-02-17

This book started as a story (kind of hokey right off the bat) about a 'master' who had all kinds of things just fall into place for him eg. free meals, ship passage from New York to London, yada yada.  The 'secret' wasn't given at this time.  Another 'master', this one, a more personal friend gave the subject (narrator) a few obvious 'secrets' of success?  Sorry to say, I guess I just missed the point.  I'll probably read it again, just for kicks.  I recommend you read \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\", or \\"As A Man Thinketh\\", or \\"The Science of Getting Rich\\".  Don't waste your time and money on this book.  On a more positive note.  I do like to have little&lt;100 page books around--especially handy when travelling.	2005-02-17

He is a lifetime student with a vast understanding of what motivates people to act and make a success of their life.  I have found, pertaining to my own life; if I use the techniques he offers in any of his many works--whether in my business, family or personal life.  I see results. <br />Yes, at many times his books seem wordy and tedious, but Covey is a master of the English language, as well as a possessor of great leadership qualities.  I find it unfortunate that many reviewers of this book, (especially highly educated readers) give it such low marks.  This is a book which must be savored, as there is a large quantity of quality information.   <br />As an example:  Covey uses an \\"indian talking stick\\", a token required to voice ones opinion when dealing with a difficult individual.  The speaker holds the stick and the other person must understand and repeat back (to the speakers satisfaction) the message the speaker is trying to convey before the stick may exchange hands. <br />The 8th Habit just picks up where the 7 Habits ended.  There is just so much to absorb that it cannot all be done in one reading.  I know that I read his book, \\"Principle Centered Leadership\\" twice, and still am in awe.  I thoroughly encourage you to read and re-read this great book.	2005-02-17

Nope, I was wrong.  I do start wondering just how the other half lives as I read his books.  This book did make me think--thence 2 stars.

I spend a great deal of time in the box myself.  In fact, my boss, as well as any boss would benefit from reading and living the great concepts portrayed in this little book.  My gripe about this, and any other modern self-help fable:  In finding a solution to the problem at hand, a story can actually twist and turn, masking any real solution, as this book did.  I don't mind reading a lot of extra words, but let them coincide with and elaborate on the concepts.  The teachings found in this book are profound.  The fact that it's written as a story--boo!  It's not that I mind reading a lot of extra words.  Author, Stephen R. Covey uses excruciating detail in his writing, without writing allegories.  So does Brian Tracy, another great author.  Another wonderful book on this same basic subject is:  The Platinum Rule, by Tony Alessandra.  Back to the book at hand:  Read it.  The advise is great--portrayed in a way unlike any other book on the subject I've read.  I highly recommend it.	2004-12-28

This is a great book about a great man.  I read a lot, but when I read that this man read entire volumes, I was impressed.  The fact that England isn't speaking German today is largely due to the perseverence of Churchill.  As far as good writing, Celia Sandys (Churchills grand-daughter) did a wonderful job.

Rather, it would be a good sourcebook for a management or marketing division.  To be honest, I couldn't read the whole book.  The writing style was dry and the business of focus 'Prime Pet Foods' isn't a Forbes 500 company.  In fact, I'm not sure it's an actual company at all.

Apparently the editors didn't like some of the language I used.  For this, I'm sorry.<br />The first half of this 5 CD set is pretty good.  It gives a lot of common knowledge advise you can find in any motivational book.  From the topic, &quot;Get a Prenuptial Agreement&quot; on, it goes down hill.  From that point, Trump gives absolutely no advise on &quot;How to Get Rich&quot;.  Sure, there are subtle hints if you listen/read between the lines, but I find it obvious that Trump knows how to get rich, but either doesn't know how too, or want too pass on the real meal (just scraps).  I, for one, could care less about his hair, or about what he does throughout the week.<br />As usual, his ego and arrogance shine through.  Throughout this program, Donald pats himself on the back (that's why he has such long arms!).  I'm very sure that he's an astute negotiator/businessman, and that he can be a human.  I'd just hate to be on the opposing team.  I'm willing to bet, he's not a gracious loser!<br />This book does have merit.  I've listened to it about 5 times now, trying to avoid the drivel.  If you read/listen to the first 1/2 or so, you will feel you got some of your moneys worth.  I feel that Donald Trump is capable of so much more than this weak effort.  I'm just glad I checked this out at my public library.  I certainly wouldn't buy it!<br />On a positive note:  I must admit, I loved the apprentice.  Trumps brand is infectious, and it's always fun to see what he'll do next... Let's just pray he's never elected President!<BR>Of course, he's already thought about that one.	2004-06-15

It's as though he re-writes the same book over and over and uses different publishers and titles each time.  Regardless, this is an outstanding book.  Any author with such a loyal following as; Brian Tracy, Zig Ziglar or Anthony Robbins, to name a few, could write just about anything and it would sell.<br />I had no choice.  I just had to give this book 5 stars.  It's that good!  If I could only convince younger readers to pick up and read this type of literature, how much brighter would their (and our) futures be.  In this, the information age, advances in technology move at such a fast pace, that unless we arm ourselves with new information, and constantly upgrade, we won't even stay in the competition.<br />This book is absolutely filled with vitally important information, and though most of it is copied verbatim from his other books, much of it is new.  I'd truly like to see Brian offer a book without any of his old stuff (like saying &quot;I like myself&quot;).  Though that type of thinking is the basis for success, those of us who read everything he writes feel his writing is becoming a little blase.  <br />If you have never read anything by Brian Tracy, but would like to, this is a great place to start.	2004-06-09

This book had the makings of a truly epic novel, easily on par with &quot;The Stand&quot;.  Sadly, after about half way through, the plot seemed to rush toward the ending.  True, the whole story, in this and many of Koontz other novels happens in one or two days, but all of your fans would like to see you milk it out a bit.<br />I agree with another reviewer, dogs do seem to find a leading role in almost every Koontz book.  Let's see one without a single bark!  I am not offended with the good/evil--God/devil thing going on.  I feel that that's just part of life.<br />There's no doubt about it, Koontz has a way with words.  I certainly enjoy his work.

I will read it for a while, put it aside, read another book, then return to this one.  It is profound.  The only book on leadership better than this (maybe):  Principle Centered Leadership.  <br />The copy I read was the first edition.  I've skimmed through this edition and found that the authors have added websites  and other informative stuff to keep it up to date.<br />Each time I've returned to this book I wonder: why did I ever put it down?

From a army standpoint, being a ranger is a big deal.  Anybody aspiring to be an outstanding military officer should so through a program such as the Rangers, Seals, Special Forces, Green Beret, etc..  Programs such as these certainly make or break an individual.  <br />This book gives the perspective of 10 men who completed the Ranger program and their struggles to overcome their individual weaknesses.  One of the Rangers spotlighted, Tex Turner adopted the statement:  &quot;As an officer, you are either a ranger or an excuse.&quot;  The author embellishes this concept:  &quot;You are either wealthy or an excuse.&quot;  &quot;You are either healthy or an excuse.&quot;  This simple saying can apply to any area of ones life.  Am I doing all I can--or am I just making excuses.<br />I highly recommend this book.  My only reservations were the authors abundant use of the F-bomb.  True, it adds to the reality of the situation these men went through, but shows a lack of professionalism as a businessman/author.  It is one minor aspect which would keep me from suggesting it to young readers.  Also, from a business perspective, this book isn't a leader in leadership books.  All in all, this book is exciting reading.  It is well written.  Many times I actually visualized myself in similar situations.  Don't make excuses.  Read this book.	2004-04-21

As stated in the title, this book deals with our relationships with supervisors, customers, co-workers, suppliers, etc..  I agree with the author, however, there are probably more than 330 ways to improve.  Even changing a few of our bad habits can make a world of difference.  We can all improve our attitudes as well as the impression we give to others.<br />One small gripe about this book:  The author cites examples for every situation.  I  would rather recieve more detail rather than examples.  Mr. DuBrin must have done a great deal of research, as there are a lot of big names from business he has included.  If the examples were left out this book would have only been about 150 pages. <br />This is a well-written, easy to read book.  There is a lot of great information within its pages.

This book offers no fancy, get-rich schemes like so many books on the market today.  Rather, Franklins advise is concise and to the point.  It's easy to see why so many of us, especially Americans, with so many resources at our disposal, are in financial dire straits.<br />Franklin admonishes us against laziness, spending more than we make, trying to keep up with the latest fashions, and stocking our pantries with expensive foods.  For the most part, we Americans have had so much for so long we've forgotten many of these simple practices.<br />This is a great book.  Worth every penny--if you read and follow its admonition.  You can read it in a half-hour easily.  In fact, as another reviewer noted; it should be carried with you, and reviewed often.  I agree.	2004-03-03

This book was narrated by its main character, Odd Thomas.  I'm sure you will love Odd.  He basically lives the life of an orphan, though both his parents are still alive.  He sees the walking dead, and senses the apparition of evil around him.  Everybody in the town of Pico Mundo, California know and love Odd. Few however, know of his gift.  Only his beautiful girlfriend, Stormy; the chief of police; his boss; and a few others, to different degrees, understand him.  <br />In this story, Odd delivers a murderer to the chief of police.  Later he gets a bad vibe from a sleazy character (fungus man), who comes into the diner where he works.  He knows that this dude brings trouble, so he follows the dark and twisted trail ahead.  <br />The villian in this book was not as terrifying as those in any of the other Koontz books I've read, yet he portrays pure evil.  One thing I love about this book--it doesn't have the usual mushy happy-ever-after ending.  In fact, the ending was fantastic.<br />The only thing I find disappointing with this book, as with all of Koontz' books:  He always ties up all the loose ends at the end of the book.  Dean, let us assume, wonder, or wander.  The pieces don't necessarily need to fit.  On the positive side, your writing is poetic, and at times, prophetic.  I look forward to your next book.	2004-02-18

It's easy to see where he has picked up a lot of the material for his other books.  I've passed through Portland a couple of times, however, the only thing I've ever done is gas up and stop for some fast-food.  Every girl I've met from Portland was hot.  It's a place I'd like to explore, especially after reading this book.  I did live in Seattle for 6 months, and did some exploring.  There is a lot of history in the great northwestern United States.  As for the sleazy strip clubs and such; I feel they cheapen an area, and give it an undesirable atmosphere.  Chuck never tries to sweeten the pot.  He goes for the guts, which I find 'fresh' and compelling.  Like another reviewer stated--the Chamber of Commerce wouldn't like potential citizens of Portland to use this book as a guide to the city.  I for one would.	2004-01-27

It should be titled How to fail as an author.

I do try to read all I can about leaders, especially books by leaders.  I'm sure Mr. Giuliani capitalized on the 9/11 disaster.  I am not aware of any infidelity in his marriage.  And I am sure Rudy is egocentric, sometimes a necessary evil required of a leader.  The basic fact is, this is a great book.  There are countless examples of leadership on every page.  Politicians are for the most part, a little slippery, especially those with a background in law.  Governing New York City would be an undaunting task.  Hats off to anyone daring or stupid enough to want to tackle it.  From the point of view of someone who has never even been to New York, I sense he did a pretty good job while he was in office.  Just read between the lines, and avoid all the name dropping--you'll find that this is a fine piece of work, worthy of reading and re-reading.	2004-01-05

The concepts it contains are simple to understand, in fact, sometimes too simplified.  This book is almost completely about finances, which is an imperative subject to understand, and follow, if one is ever to have financial stability or wealth.  I hoped this would have been more of a feel good motivational book, along the lines of Tony Robbins, but it isn't that kind of book at all.  This book does show its age, as it was written in the mid nineties, however, with the current resurrgence of the stock market I can look back and see some of the financial mistakes I've made since that time.  When I began reading this book I felt the author lacked a deep understanding as a financier, however, by the time I'd read about half the book I was convinced that He is concerned about the welfare of those he teaches and inspires.  In comparison with a book like Rich Dad Poor Dad, well, this book blows that one away.  Hopefully you will read this review and skip that one.	2003-12-29

There are only one hundred-ninety nine pages, yet it took me some time to get through this book.  As the author states at the first of the book, this is not a how-to book, rather, it is a compillation of a lifetime of observation by this highly intelligent man.  The word leadership is difficult to define, and every author/expert has a different definition.  Gardner points out the many qualities, and qualifiers which define a leader, and he does it better than any author on the subject I've read yet.  I enjoyed this book a little less than Covey's &quot;Principle Centered Leadership&quot;, yet it does hold it's own.  Anyone aspiring to the leader/manager level would do well to read this and other books on the subject.	2003-12-15

The release date for this book has been bumped again and again for a long time now, with no book in sight.  For such a well-liked motivational speaker, you leave a lot to be desired.  Oh well, you've made your money--right?  Like all of you other reviewers of make believe books, I agree, this is Robbins best to date.  It's just too bad that such a great motivator of others can't get off his but, quit shoulding over himself, and write his book.  A great many fans are becoming disappointed.  Come on Tony, you can do it.  Write, edit, and publish your book.  I, for one, hope you're ashamed of yourself.  But, as I stated earlier, You've made your money, so piss on your followers.

Self administered tests accompanied every chapter to analyze where you excel and where improvement is needed in your life.  This information has been presented by many authors, and tends to become redundant after reading as many books on the subject as I have.  I still have a long way to go in the field of self-improvement, so reading a book such as this is definitely a positive step.  For any reader new to the concept of self-improvement/motivation, this is a great place to start.	2003-11-21

It has sat on the shelf for years without me reading it.  I picked it up the other day and read it in about half an hour.  I now understand the significance of this book, even though it was written long ago.  This book truly makes one look at how they've lived their life, their thoughts, and actions.  Each of us has room for improvement, that's what life is about.  We have all undoubtedly errored in our judgement, or in how we have treated others, and had to live with the consequences.  This book brings contemplation of these subjects and others to the surface of our minds.  This is not a how-to book.  It is also not a hell-fire and brimstone, shame inducing book.  Rather, it is just a reminder, letting us know that we can reach for, and achieve a higher level of being.  I love this book!  You will love it as well!	2003-11-21

Coveys writing style is superb, his understanding of human nature is uncanny.<BR>     He starts by forming a simile: the art of leadership is like farming.  It requires daily vigilance: planting, watering, weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting--in that order.  If a farmer owns a cow, he doesn't just milk it when he feels like it.  It is a job which needs to be done twice daily, every day.  Managing (Leading) a business is exactly the same, at least if you want it to be done correctly.  Many managers/leaders feel that it's okay to run a business on auto-pilot.  This may be a fatal error.<BR>     Covey uses the same 7 Steps as he uses in the same-titled book.  He also compares his 7 Step leadership methods with those of the great W. Edwards Deming.  Throughout this book the author guides the leader/person to lead by example.  To allow those he leads to be self-leaders, and to feel that they are of great importance to the company.<BR>     One of the major aims of Covey is to make a Mission Statement.  This, he believes, should be done by all members of a company/corporation/family, etc..  He also stresses the age old Confucious saying, &quot;Feed a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&quot;<BR>     I have a great deal of respect for this man, and truly believe he walks his talk.  As I read this book, many of the concepts pertained to situations in my life which I was dealing with at that very time (a little haunting, perhaps inspired?).  I highly recommend this book, as well as any other by this great human being and author.	2003-10-03

Sad yet prolific, this book is just fun to read. Strange as it may sound, Diary reminded me of something by Ayn Rand.  There is no doubt, Palahniuk (you) is from another world.  I'll always be anxiously awaiting his (your) next publication.  If you want to read a book which will leave you wondering what you just read, read any of Chucks books.

The evil \\"Corky Laputa\\" is a villian equally vicious as any of Koontz' constructed villians.  Even though this book does end happily (oops, I hope I didn't ruin it for you), it does not contain the mushy-happily ever after feeling many of his books leave one with.  Many times throughout this book, I found myself hypnotized by the reality.  I raced through this book, and had a tough time putting it down.	2003-09-03

The authors job is to pick jury members.  She has picked members from such famous cases as O.J. Simpsons murder trial.  This book outlines characteristics the authors have observed over many years of jury selection.  This book should be read by personnel directors, as well as managers, landlords, and anyone interested in the study of human behavior.  My only complaint:  This book was written from the viewpoint of a jury selector, with a narrow focus on finding a person to either acquit or convict the subject on trial.  Over all, this book rated 4 1/2-5 stars.  To really comprehend this book, one must read it again and again, as well as practice-Reading People.	2003-08-25

I often let others railroad me, and talk over the top of me-as if they know it all.  I wish to learn to assert myself, and basically, argue and win more of the time. This book contains the wisdom of a very wise, and winning lawyer.  Much can be learned from one who has worn many pairs of shoes, and walked many miles.  I would rather have it 'cut and dried', without all the fluff.  This book is like a treasure chest, to an aspiring trial lawyer.  For the layman, reading this book will not help you negotiate any better, or win more arguments.  I'm sure there are better books on the subject.	2003-07-29

In fact, he probably rolled over in his grave when the magazine went out of publication.  It was a time of mourning for me.  In fact, I was just in the process of renewing my subscription when I found out...&quot;Success&quot; was no longer successful (how ironic).<br />  This set of books is excellent.  Most of the writing is examples of successful people from the past and present (1911).  This type of motivational writing tends to get repetitive, however, there is a lot of advise tucked carefully between the many examples given.  It was a very different world when the author wrote this book, but as I read it I noticed, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  One difference I like is the chivalry and honesty exhibited from the time period.  Even the highest standards of decency today are a far cry from that time.  It was a lot of fun reading some of the examples from that era and knowing they were current events.  These books are well worth the read, if you can find them.	2003-06-18

His plot and story lines remind me a lot of Koontz, and that is neither good or bad.  This is a fantastic area, but as many writers have delved into similar stories, an author must go above and beyond the norm.  I love many of the movies based on Crichtons novels: Andromeda Strain, and Jurassic Park especially.  I do believe that between Crichton and Spielberg this would make a killer movie, but the screenplay would have to be better than the book.

This book is almost as good, in fact, the presentation is better.  If you haven't read one of his books, this is a great start.  The detail in this book surpasses all of the other books he has written. But sadly, most of the material is repetitive.  Brian Tracy is, in my opinion, THE BEST in his field.  I own most of his books, as well as audio tapes and videos.  It's not so much his presentation as his material that makes him so dynamic.  As a success junkie, I've read many/most motivational specialists. Tracy beats them, hands down.  If you like this stuff, but are sick of the Anthony Robbins type spiel, get into Brian Tracy.

A lot of information concerning mixers, ovens, and other topics were covered.  Too much repetition, as well as too much focus on statistics of the big companies was a downer.  As a pizza affectionado and person looking into the pizza business I would have liked a little more advise for beginners.  I got the same vibes as the reviewer from illinois, the author could have done a better job.  All in all, this is a great introductory book.  I think Tracy Powell should re-write this book from a whole different point of view:  From the conception of  a small pizza shop to the grand opening/first $1.00.

There is a lot of good info between the pages.  I do wish the author would have gone into more detail.  The chapters on toppings and sauces were vague, perhaps even a little rushed.  I also would have liked some information on larger quantity (commercial) pizza making.  Another complaint: there was not a section in the back of the book for sources (e.g.-product and equipment suppliers).

In effect, the book focused on the fact that as baby boomers reach retirement age (around 2016) there will be a major stock market crash because of all of the retirees drawing from their stock based 401ks.  I am in total agreement with the authors advise that this country is in dire need of financial education.<BR>  My gripe is that he advises readers to \\"build businesses and invest in real estate\\".  All well and good, right?  The problem...he never, I repeat, never goes into any detail in this or any of his books.  He advises buying investment real estate and holding it.  Any advise on land-lording?  No way!  Any advise on business building?  Hah!<BR>  He pushes his other products throughout the book though:  His board games; Cashflow 101 and 202, his other books, his seminars, etc., etc..  I would personally like to own and play the board games, but they sell for a whopping $250.00.  He charges $4-5 thousand for his seminars.  Come on, is this guy interested in helping the country's financial woes or just cashing in on foolish consumers (like me).  Mr. Kiyosaki has made millions, which is wonderful in our capitalistic system, yet he has no family to be concerned with, and to expect hard working families to spend hard-earned money on his pie-in-the-sky (wealth building?) information is a little hard to swallow.<BR>  The inventor of the board game 'Monopoly' was an out of work employee.  It took many attempts and a lot of frustration to finally get Milton Bradley to buy the rights to the game, yet the inventor still received a lot of money from royalties.  Why doesn't Robert Kiyosaki learn a lesson from this example?  Oh yeah...Greed!<BR>  This is a well written book with a great deal of merit.

The left side of the page (likely written by Robert Allen) gives workable plans to amass a million dollars.  The right side (probably by Mark Victor Hansen) tells a fable of a young mother (Michelle, who is left alone by the sudden death of her husband.  Her evil inlaws conspire to ruin her life by taking custody of her two children.  She loses her home and is forced to work to support herself.  While working as a waitress, she meets a highly successful woman who takes her under her wing and teaches her the secrets of the rich.  After acquiring a margin of self-esteem, she confronts her father-in-law with a wager.  The bet: if she has one million dollars in cash within ninety days, she gets full custody of her kids, but if she fails she gives up all rights and moves out of state.  The book goes into the details of the work involved in the next three months.  The story was interesting, however, simplistic.  Many of the day to day routines were left out.  Michelle had a success team, which I agree is an important aspect, however, each person on the team would have more of a life than portrayed.  Also, the mentor portrayed basically gives up her own busy life to assure Michelles success.  I felt that the story was a little hokey.  I also felt as though I'd read everything on the left pages in Robert Allens other books.  I do not feel cheated in any way by buying and reading this book.  I do believe that other books by both authors fulfill the same requirements.  The basic concept of this book, as in all self-help books...Do it!	2002-12-09

Drinking a lot of water is very important, and vital to the functioning of all our organs.  I do agree with another reviewer; the type of water was never discussed, (something also to consider).  The authors writing was not reader friendly, which was okay because of the content.  One topic that I felt was important:  Do not attempt to remove salt from your diet.  His reason for this was:  Salt helps the body absord and assimilate water.  As for me, I know I need to drink more water than I do.  It's something we need to develop a habit for.  It's true, water is not the only solution.  We also need a good diet, exercise, rest, and good posture... not to mention a dynamic attitude.	2002-12-05

The author used laws (80 compared to 48), as well as historical and political examples to make his point.  This book is much shorter, making it an easier read.  I enjoyed reading this book, but should have had a dictionary handy, as there were a lot of big words.  If you like &quot;The Prince&quot;, &quot;The Art of War&quot;, or &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; you will like this book as well.	2002-11-22

I was disappointed with Black House.  Hearts in Atlantis interested me so I grovelled through it, and felt that I'd wasted a lot of time. I read The Stand with mild reservations. I'd seen the movie several years ago, so I knew the basic story. In my opinion, the movie doesn't scratch the surface. This book is so full of twisted wisdom that it's hard to put into words. The story of each of the main characters lives is told, as well as the underlying tales, with exquisite detail. There is a great deal of philosopy as well as psycology tucked between these covers. Since I'd seen the movie, it was easy to picture the characters. The movie character, \\"Randall Flagg\\" was perfect, and I pictured him each time he was mentioned. This book will stick in my mind for a long time. I own several other S.K. books, and will read them someday--probably not for awhile though. I'm still trying to digest The Stand.  My life will never be quite the same--yet, that's a good thing.	2002-11-11

On par with the others: Intensity, False Memory and, From the Corner of His Eye.  I was given used copies of most of Koontz' books.  When one of them grabs me, I'll grab it back.  This story took off right from the start and didn't let up till the end.  Koontz seems to write in a groove.  Each of his books are the same... only, different.  I'm not convinced that he writes on par with Steven King, but after reading Black House, by King, maybe Koontz is better.  Nevertheless, his books are fun to read.  The endings on some of the others have gotten soft--not this one.  It was like a bad dream that just seemed to get worse... with a happy ending.	2002-10-08

I am sorry to say, I was not impressed. As a budding Real Estate student, I hoped to get a lot of great information on buying and selling properties. It seemed to me, that Dr. Powelsons only interest is to take advantage of unsuspecting victims (Caveat Emptor). That wasn't my biggest gripe, however. This book was just plain tough to read, It's not that it contains big words or anything, it's just plain confusing. I also felt that the print was too small. Almost every time I start reading it I fall asleep. Perhaps it is written only for advanced investors. I will keep my book as a reference guide,as there is a lot of great information in it. \\"The Real Estate Bible\\", as he calls it... hardly... Sorry, thats just my opinion. Modern Real Estate Practice, by Galaty, Allaway, and Kyle--now that is more like the Real Estate Bible. That book covers just about everything pertaining to Real Estate. This book is just about buying and selling for nothing down, etc.. As I've said, this book does have a lot of advise concerning creative financing, and I may have some of its information tucked away somewhere in my gray matter.

This is the same topic as the Richest Man in Babylon, Acres of Diamonds, etc.,etc...  The analogy the author used of the worker carrying the bucket of water, compared with the worker building a pipeline to carry the water was great.  When the story took a turn to compare e-commerces, I was dispelled.  And when the story took even another subtle turn to flaunt another e-commerce provider (Quixtar), even though the name was never mentioned, I was sickened.  I guess I can't complain, I borrowed this book knowing the person I borrowed it from was peddling his MLM, Network Marketing, etc., what ever its latest name is.

I'm sad to see that the original director did not direct this movie.  Since he didn't, a better choice may have been David Fincher (Fight Club).  At any rate, I have my hopes up.<BR>I was disappointed with the way the author left some parts of the story unfinished, such as the chapter about Dolarhydes childhood.  Harris had an excellent chance of putting together a fantastic finale, yet he rushed the ending.  Don't get me wrong, the ending, as well as the whole book was spooky.  Just a little touch-up and this book would have been a perfect 5.	2002-09-09

Like many other books, eg.; The One Minute Manager (series), The Instant Millionaire, Who Moved My Cheese, etc., this book is a metaphor.  I actually like this book better than those mentioned.

At once it seemed to be science fiction, and then sad, helpless philosophy. I also like the writing style of Chuck Palahniuk, and this, in some strange way resembles his quirky work. In another way this book reminded me of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\",and perhaps \\"Farenheit 451\\".   I'm sure there is a message buried deeply within these pages, but I read it for enjoyment and so should you. I felt both deeply disturbed as well as curious when I finished reading.

There are more techniques than a beginner as myself can use. This makes some of the chapters seem a little dry. Some of Rons techniques seem somewhat scandalous, if not downright unlawful. I wonder if Ron has created any enemies in Florida? His big push is--get out and make offers. Nothing will happen until I do. Ron has definitely done a great deal of research in the field. I have listened to his spiel in person, and know for a fact that he pulls no punches. This book, along with the tape set of the same name includes so much information that they must be studied over and over again.  A Downside?  Ron includes absolutely no information concerning tax shelters.  In a business like this, especially if you make large profits, Uncle Sam will definitely have his greedy hand out.  Capital gains and income tax, to name two.  Just don't let delusions of grandeur mask the fact that there are always risks and downsides.... Buy it and read it.	2002-06-11

Kessler recommended by many famous creative real estate entreprenuers, thus, I hoped for much more.  This book starts out with real estate definitions.  These definitions are made much clearer in a standard real estate textbook.  The majority of the book is spent giving examples of others creative exploits.  Little information is given on actually becoming a creative investor.  Perhaps part of the problem was the fact that this book was written twenty-one years ago.  I'll bet even if this were the most updated version there would still be much better books out there.  Even though there are only 270+ pages, I struggled to finish reading it.  There is actually a lot of information within these pages.  I've just already read much better.  Save your time and money.  Avoid this book.	2002-05-31

The old adage \\"you can't judge a book by its cover\\" definitely applies in the case of this book.  I feel that Mr. Maxwell is probably very knowledgeable, and can probably tell stories till the cows come home, but stories alone do little to help one become a leader.  Mr. Maxwell also wasted many pages recalling his great leadership abilities in the ministries he lead.  It seemed strange that not once did this minister mention his gratitude to the Lord for his success as a leader.  I must admit, Mr. Maxwell is a gifted writer, however, each adecdote was weaved into a sermon, which left me wondering--which rule was this?  A book with a title like this is a magnet to someone like me with an insatiable appetite for knowledge and improvement.  I like a more direct approach when I read and study, but hey, that's just me.  I was much more impressed by \\"Principle Centered Leadership\\", by Steven R. Covey, or by one of the many books written by Brian Tracy.

It contained almost nothing that hadn't been written before.  Total common sense when it comes to spending less, saving, and investing in stocks was the body of this book.  One thing I learned, and totally agree with is the Armchair Millionaire method of investing 33 1/3% of your total investment in a fund which tracks the S&amp;P 500; 33  1/3% in a fund which tracks the Russell 2000; and, 33 1/3% in a fund tracking large cap foreign stocks.  This book is not about getting rich quick, no, far from it.

I have to agree with the negative reviewers of this book, Mr. Allens challenge to make $24,000 in 24 hours was scamful (is that a word?).  Considering the fact that he was already a well known author and real-estate goo rue.  This ploy was only a great publicity stunt, not so different from P.T. Barnum and others who have attained a high level of success.  It's true, Mr. Allen did pander his web-site as well as all of his books and tape sets in excess, and this would scare some thin-skinned readers away.  Now for the good stuff:  whether this information is outdated or not, the internet is where it's at.  Much of his book was authored by people who had gone from simple ideas to making millions of dollars online.  With constantly growing traffic and all the garbage on the net there's never a better time than now to do it!  Robert Allen pulls no punches and lets the reader know this business takes a lot of work and research.  It is neither stated or implied that this is a get-rich-quick scheme.  Roberts writing style is impeccable, especially for a writer of how-to books.  This book seemed more like a suspense novel.  I loved it and highly recommend it.	2002-03-05

I was fascinated by the villain, Junior (Enoch) Cain.  His role was that of a narcissistic, egotistical, megalomaniac.  Throughout the book comments were made about his resolve to be above other men, and actually live in the future, rather than the past or present.  He studied a ficticious motivator named Caesar Zedd.  Junior felt that he was desired by every woman he came in contact with.  After murdering his wife, he felt justified to kill anyone who meddled with his plans.  The other key player in the book was a child prodigy named Bartholomew.  Bartholomew had the power to visit parallel worlds, and understand complex situations--even at a very young age.  A pesky--unrelenting detective, Thomas Vanadium, suspecting that Junior had murdered his wife, rather than watching her fall to her death, continued his vigil.  As he watched Junior as he slept, junior used the word 'Bartholomew'.  When Junior awoke, Vanadium informed him of his verbal dream.  In order to find peace in his life, Junior vowed to destroy this nemesis, the unknown Bartholomew.  Many wild twists and turns accompany this tale, most of which I left out.  It was great to read that each time Junior killed somebody, he suffered plagues: vomiting, diarrhea, hives, and boils.  After killing his wife, he was never at peace, regardless of how much he looked for it.  I was hoping all of the families he so recklessly destroyed would have made his life and death more gruesome.  I questioned how he located those victims who relocated to southern California so quickly, as well as; where were all the cops during his killing frenzy?  On the brighter side, Dean Koontz has such an outstanding literary ability, it makes it a delight to read his books.  I recommend this one, and I'm sure I'll read more.	2002-01-29

This is the first self improvement book I ever read!  I just finished reading it again...Wow!  Mr. Tracy does such a fine job of explaining self-motivation/improvement.  I've read many of his books, as well as listened to a great majority of his tapes.  In my book, he's the best!  Other motivational speakers/writers are good: Zig Ziglar, Denis Waitley, Anthony Robbins, Jim Rohn, etc..  Mr. Tracy is just the best, hands down.  This is his best book period.  Unfortunately, all of his many other books repeat the same techniques--worded differently, so I suppose it wouldn't matter which of Tracy's books you read first.  At some point, if Brian Tracy continues to write, I'd like to see him infuse some totally fresh stuff.  One thing readers of this genre need to understand, it's the repetition of these very basic concepts which must permeate ones thick skull and make a permanent dent in the old gray matter (I'm speaking from experience).  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their life.  One day I hope to meet Brian Tracy and thank him personally for the profound impact he has had on my life.

The stories, fables and anecdotes are fascinating.  The author has outdone himself as an historian.  His style is excellent and topics profound.  I found it difficult to read the text and subtext (along the books borders &amp; in red letters) simultaneously.  My major gripe is that the author made minimal effort in instructing me, the reader, in how to use these laws.  I feel that a self help book (if that's what you would call this one), should have more instruction.  Other than those two gripes, I loved this book.  It is a book which would be better left out of the wrong hands.  One of Hitlers favorite books was &quot;The Prince&quot;.  I have to admit, I felt somewhat dirty reading this book.  I still found it very interesting, and would recommend it.	2002-01-03

The first section about the children living in Connecticut and the old man and the &quot;low men in yellow&quot; coats started leading in the same direction as Black House.  I found this disconcerting and almost quit reading, however, the next section had a different twist.  Each section contained at least one character from the previous one, and so, in a sort of twisted way, they all fit together--like a puzzle.  Kings liberal use of the 'f' word was offensive to me, but I have to admit, I enjoyed this book.  I actually wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, and thought I'd like to have a frame of reference from the book.  Happy reading.	2001-12-19

He comes in contact with a young American man searching the deserts  for an answer to the question; how can he become wealthy?  The American (Andrew) does a favor for the mid-eastern man, so the man gives Andrew the artifacts (7 scrolls bound in leather).  After running out of money, Andrew sails back to America.  He takes the scrolls to a rabbi to be translated.  The scrolls are stolen, yet the writings are saved, and he is given copies.  The book then lists all of the transcription (supposedly written by Solomon).  The advise is sound, the same information written in The Richest Man in Babylon.  Andrew follows this advise and becomes extremely wealthy as well as charitable.  The author describes the character, Andrew as Andrew Carnegie.  This was an easy book to read, and left a wonderful impression on me.  I'd already read another book by the author; Success, the Glenn Bland Method.  That book was even better.  This is an excellent book for readers of all ages.	2001-12-06

Considering the synergistic power of two famous authors, I thought this book would be the ultimate.  I felt that my time in reading this book was a waste of six+ hours, and would advise readers to read other materials.  Every strange twist and turn in this story was totally predictable.  The topic, while gruesome and sadistic, seemed almost normal.  I was hoping to be gripping an armrest and losing sleep as I read this book.  This definitely wasn't the case.  I do believe that with a lot of re-structuring, this would make a fabulous horror film. especially if directed by Mr. King.  I was far from impressed.	2001-12-03

Dr. Schwartz writes in a manner which is direct and easy to understand--a must for writers of self-help books.  The concepts are simple.  Treat people with kindness, understanding, and assertion, and you will get more of what you want.  I know this because I have practiced many of these methods and they have worked for me.  You will be surprised at the affect a smile has on other people.  While this book was not my favorite, I rate it a solid four stars--plus.  Do yourself a favor.  Read this book.	2001-11-29

The format was identical to Intensity.  The only difference being, this book took its own sweet time in identifying the villian.  This book truly drags.  The villian in this book is the best you will ever come across.  I found him more despicable than even Hannibal Lechter.  The concept is utterly creepy.  Just the thought of someone having the power to get into a mind and brain-wash it is terrifying.  The character; Susan was very well played.  Some of the others: Dusty, Martie, Skeet, etc., etc., seemed somewhat shallow.  The final destruction of the villian needed to be more gruesome, to justify his inhumane mutilation of others.  Koontz does have an absolutely amazing way with words.  I just wish he would use a few less, and get to the point.	2001-11-16

I hoped for more.&quot;	This is the third Palahniuk novel I've read, and sadly, the worst.  The first half of the book focuses on the slave-labor existence of Tender Branson (the main character).  His life as an unimportant drone member of The Creedish, (a cult) requires him to work as a slave for a wealthy couple.  He cleans their fine home as well as prepares their meals.  The strange thing is, however, he never meets them.  He is required to account for all his actions to a social worker, who is also an alcoholic.  He dresses in shabby work clothes and chops his hair with pruning shears.  One interesting aspect of this book is all of the cleaning and cooking advise he gives to correlate with the story.  Anyway, not to get sidetracked, Tender also has his own suicide hotline, except instead of talking people out of taking their own lives he tells them to kill themselves.  One poor victim just happened to be the brother of a girl Tender becomes interested in.  This adds a new twist to an already twisted tale.  One of the requirements in being a member of the Creedish faith is that the member must commit suicide, which Tender totally intends to do eventually.  As the book goes on, the population of the Creedish religion dwindles till Tender is the only known living member.  The media gets wind of this fact and has a heyday.  Suddenly Tender is a superstar.  He becomes a TV evangalist, is on commercials, has his own product line, well you get the gist.  Tender is constantly flying around the country as part of his famous lifestyle.  In a flight to the south pacific Tender decides to perform his suicide mission into the outback territory of Australia.  This part of the story is made known at the first of the book.  In fact to make my review a little bit more comprehendable?  The first page of this book is actually the last.  I realize this review may absolutely make no sense at all to you, the reader.  But basically, this book is about the same.  I've read Fight Club, Choke, and Survivor.  Ienjoyed them in the same order.  While it's true, this book does leave a lasting impression, with me it wasn't a good one.	2001-10-31

Again, this book does contain positive information, so I do recommend it.	2001-10-30

While compelling and narrative, his books have an eerie emptiness about them.  There are always several stories within the story.  In this story Victor Mancini works in a replica early colonial village.  All of the village employees are drug or sex addicts.  Victors best friend, Denny also works there, he is hopelessly addicted to masturbating.  Victors neurotic mother lives in an expensive convalescent center, so victor fakes choking to death in every restaurant to pity customers into giving him money.  Victor goes to sexaholic meetings to pick up women for sex.  He tells of his mothers erratic and abusive behavior towards him when he was young, etc. etc., well you get the idea.

The movie would not have been possible without the book.  Chuck Palahniuk weaves a tortured tale about _____ _____? (the narrator) and Tyler Durden.  The story is cool and believable.  In fact, I have come up with several versions of a Fight Club II in my own mind after reading Palahniuks novels and watching the movie.  I'd seen the movie twenty times or more before ever reading the book.  It became imperative that I read the book.  Between Palahiuk and the screenplay writer, and David Finchers exquisite directing the movie was a masterpiece.  The book, however left something to be desired.	2001-10-08

My son urged me to read it, stating, &quot;if you don't read it, I'll tell you how it ends.&quot;  I stayed up till the wee hours of the morning finishing this book.  Once I finished reading, I had trouble sleeping.  This book definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.  At times I felt as though I was in Chynas place.

Their writing style and story telling ability is matched by few.  This book is full of life stories, told by people--not about people.  I generally do not like anecdotal or biographical books.  This one however, was different.  I loved it.  If you think you never get anything from life, or you just don't know how to get what you really want--Read this book.  It contains many great teachings about how to ask, as well as how to help others.  It was definitely worth the time and effort to read this book.	2001-09-21

This book is very reader friendly, and informative. Our life brands should be just as important to us as Coca-Cola is to its makers. It really boils down to standing for what we believe in, and getting ourselves known by as many people as we can. Mr. Graham focuses on public speaking, service work, advertising, etc.. My only qualms about this great book is the authors redundant use of anecdotes. If he would have used less examples and more of his great teaching abilities, I would have surely given this book five stars.	2001-09-20

This book is written in such a way that anyone can read it.  Most of the information is basic information, but the picture the author portrays seems like a medical marvel.  There are so many ways that we can improve our lives, and move closer to success, that Dr. Arnot barely scratches the surface.  The chapters on exercize and moving beyond our comfort zones motivated me the most.  Dr. Arnot abolished the age old myth that we should not over-train, but rather push ourselves to new levels if we want to improve.  That is something I have long agreed with.  This book is not chock-full of new information, if that is what you are looking for.  Rather, this book is one of many of the well written volumes of success available.  I highly recommend it.	2001-09-04

I do believe that the author has a very high degree of charisma. Her writing style is impressive and compelling. Her overpowering use of metaphysical programming in order to achieve charisma seemed off-track, although intriguing. subjects such as proper breathing and speaking were highly pertinent and interesting, but I feel the same as I did after reading another book on the subject. The author pushes her seminar throughout this book. Perhaps one would become more charismatic after attending. Becoming charismatic is an elusive quality. Overcoming fear. Now that's the way to reach charisma. Again, this is a wonderful book, including--but not based on the virtue of charisma.	2001-08-27

Most books in this genre are directed more at hype and go-get-it-iv-ness, this philosophy is fine, but it's great to read from a different perspective from time to time.

Charisma is a real thing.  It is an eviable attribute of actors, athletes, musicians, wealthy business people and others.  Are we born with it?  Possibly--however, I, as well as the author believe each of us can increase our level of charisma.  This book was chock-full of very useful information.  My only complaint was, after each example the author threw in an anecdote.  An example or explanation of the topic presented is an excellent way to write--when done tastefully.  The author embellished each and every topic discussed.  The only problem with writing in this manner is, it sidetracks the reader rather than focusing on the topic.  After reading hundreds of self-help books I have come to the conclusion that the best of their genre focus on direct principles rather than stories about the author or others.  It is very true that with a high level of charisma each one of us would accomplish more than we could imagine.  I applaud the author on addressing this topic--and do highly recommend this book.	2001-08-07

I have probably watched the movie twenty-plus times.  I read this book with an open mind, but just could not picture Tom Hanks as the character in this book.  Forrest is portrayed as a clumsy, dopey, behemoth.  He finishes school, joins the military, becomes a pro-wrestler/hustler, has wild sex with Jenny, etc., etc..  He doesn't meet a bunch of presidents.  He isn't the loving son, he doesn't even have a son.  He doesn't &quot;feel like running&quot;, and so on.  This book does contain a lot of humor and was worth reading (sort of).  But I wasn't extremely impressed.

I got the impression that this book was just about not letting others intimidate you, but on further reading, it became very apparent that his focus was on turning the tables.  It was like, screw you before you screw me.  The book did a great job of defining the three types of intimidators, and how to avoid being intimidated by them, but focused only on the authors experiences.  Long before reading this book, I read 'Million Dollar Habits', also by Robert J. Ringer.  That book was fantastic.  This book didn't measure up, it was mean-spirited and vengeful in comparison.

After reading many books in this genre, it's still refreshing to read a winner.  The three authors that composed this book share years and years of combined experience.  If you want to improve your life, you must focus on where you want to be, and what the benefits will be reaped as you achieve your goals.  Change is difficult, I know that as well as anybody.  What I do know, however, is that change is possible-and probable if we constantly work on it.  One shortcoming that I found was that the book focused more on business than personal improvement.  Oh well, the sub-title states, &quot;How To Hit Your Business, Personal and Financial Targets with Absolute Certainty&quot;, so I really can't complain.  In reading this book, the reader is asked to complete a series of questions following each chapter.  I did not complete this as of my first reading.  I'm certain that even more can be gleaned from honestly answering each of the questions.  I will re-read and assess my life in a future reading.  Happy reading!	2001-05-04

The author herself swam the English Channel.  she also swam five laps around Manhattan Island.  I cannot picture myself accomplishing these feats, nor do I attempt to try them.  This book was not written to convince anyone to push themselves to match or exceed these high levels of athletic prowess, but merely to point out that we all posess the potential to do so much more than we are now doing, and even more than we can visualize ourselves doing.

As I just happen to live in the same area as he does it would be wonderful to run into him someday.  Most of the material he's used in this book has been used (either books or tapes) by him before.  However, like any positive material, it is all worth repeating.  The only drawback to this book (four stars) is that it dwells so much on Hyrums experiences- rather than giving usable advice to its readers (the old WIIFM).  This book did leave me with the warm fuzzies, which by the way, is one of the ways I rate a book.  If you are a reader of self-help books, this is a winner.	2001-03-26

They are doing a great service for anyone interested in investing, or building a strong financial future in general.  It seems that nowdays there are so many 'shisters' out there, so willing to take the last crumb of food from our lips, that it's frightening.  From what I've seen on the Fools website, Dave and Tom are both Foolishly excited about us (jr. Fools) becoming financially educated.  This book is waaay to full of puns and cynicism.  If you can get through the funny business, however, you will find a gem of a book.  Sometimes their humor is actually laughable.  Advanced investors may find this treatise on investing somewhat simplified, but that's the way it should be.  Why confuse a bunch of simple Fools!  Good book with a happy ending!	2001-03-06

I do believe, to borrow from another great author, &quot;The seeds of greatness are in us&quot;.  Change is never easy, but, we do hold within our subconscious, the answer to all of our conflicts.  This is definitely a good pick-me-up book.  As far as I know, this is the only book Marshall Sylver has written.  What a shame!  I know if he were to write another I would read it.  I do own his tape program of the same name.  It is a good program as well. In fact, the tape program is virtually the same in every way, except that it also contains audio versions of the hypnotic scripts for profit, power and passion.  If you enjoy this kind of book this is a great one.	2001-03-05

This book is fascinating however, and does a good job of  keeping you reading-- to find out how the story will end.  The main objective that I found as I read this book was this; the main fictional character in the story was able to get out of his comfort zone and searched for something deeper.  Ken Roberts does a good job of story telling.  He used a very descriptive style, which left me feeling as though I were there.  The down-side of this book is that the moral of the story could have been written in a ten page pamphlet.  I am not impressed in any way with the Ken Roberts Co., but my intent in this book review was not to down-play his writing in any way.  I did enjoy the final episode in this book a great deal, however, it still only rates about two stars in my book.	2001-02-28

A keeper!&quot;	This is the first, but not last book I'll read by Robert Ringer.  He has an excellent writing style that wouldn't let me put this book down.  I do feel that million dollar habits must be cultivated.  They don't come natural- unless you have been born into several generation wealth.  Even in that case they must be worked on.  This book was not merely about becoming financially rich, rather, changing ones lifestyle.  I do not know of the writers origin, but he seems to have lived a rags to riches life.  Great read.	2001-02-27

Mitchells excellent critique.  Robert T. Kiyosaki writes on a fantastic concept.  I totally believe in lifelong learning, as well as being my own employer.  Children NEED this concept implanted deeply in their minds at a young age.  The rate of technological expansion is moving at an astronomical speed.  Any and all education in a childs life is valuable.  It is sad to see so many youth totally oblivious to the facts.  Our school systems are definitely antiquicated.  While I always seem to be compelled to read Mr. Kiyosakis books, I do find them very repetitive and parableistic, which may cause some readers to feel that they are his way of 'laughing all the way to the bank'.  His constant semi-subliminal persuasion to buy his game, or attend his seminars is also highly annoying.  It would be a lot more interesting if Mr. Kiyosaki would include more specifics, ie.; 'buy these, or invest in that', etc..  I do hope that readers of this review will look past the negatives that I've pointed out.  These are simply my observations.  The concepts in this book are outstanding, and I do highly recommend it, especially if you have children.	2001-02-14

We all have room for improvement and it's a lot easier to see our lives from the outside in.  It is a great idea to step back from time to time and analyze where we're at, where we want to be, and where we want to go.  Mr. Millman has done his homework.  Again, as I have stated in other reviews, if a book is positive in nature, and improves someones life, it is worthy of reading.  My religious beliefs cause me to reject many of his ideals in this book, but from a spiritual standpoint, I agree with the concepts he presents.  Well worth the time spent reading.	2001-02-12

The writer seems to offer a lot of hype to intrigue and motivate the reader to think he/she can read the thoughts and actions of others.  Reading others body language, posture, and handwriting, as the author believes, are ways for us to control their actions.  I do not totally believe this, but find it very interesting, especially the chapter on handwriting.  The author also spends a lot of time telling the reader that he can have any thing he wants if he desires it enough.  He writes a chapter on obtaining money from various sources.  These concepts were weak, at best, when this book was written.  Now, they would be totally invalid.  This is an entertaing book, and would be worth a couple of your precious hours to read it-just for the fun of it.	2001-01-25

READ THIS BOOK!  I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic.  Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual.  His whole life centered around education (life-long learning).  Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept.  The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school!  I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning!  This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race.  The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about.  He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors.  He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars.  I would highly recommend it nevertheless.  Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever.  Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind.  I certainly feel better about life after reading this book.  You will too.	2001-01-16

If you haven't  taken the time to listen to audio programs- you are missing out on a treasure trove of information.  Debra Benton strikes me as a woman who gets things done.  She offers only positive, business minded ideas.  It may be true that there are more qualified writers/speakers on the subject (however, she is the narrator of her tapes, and does an outstanding job).  No, of course all listeners will not become CEO's, but don't be misled by the title.  There are lasting rewards in listening to these tapes!  I have listened through them three times and will be listening many more times in the future.  Find the gems in this material rather than the flaws, you will find this to be great stuff!	2001-01-05

The first time I heard this fabulous book read was only a few years ago, as part of a talk.  Since that time I've wondered who wrote these wonderful and witty words.  Dr. Seuss, you've got to be kidding?  This man was a literary genius!  This is a simple 5 minute read, a book in which no one is above reading.  Make it a goal to burn the words of this book into your memory.  Give it as a gift. Read it to children.  Write it's words on a card and carry them with you, and read it- especially if you feel as though life's got you down.  p.s. The art work is great too!	2000-12-28

I really thought it would focus on a lot of please &amp; thank-you's, along with the persuasive manipulation of people.  I was pleased to find that this wasn't the case.  The first sixty-eight pages are filled with amateur illustrations on one page followed by captions such as, &quot;Fly first class for the price of coach&quot;- after which the author would explain how to ask for an upgrade etc..  Needless to say, after reading the first sixty-eight pages I was ready to throw in the towel... But wait, from there the book exploded.  This is a book about direct marketing.  I am not a marketing specialist by any means, but this book helped me realize that everyone is marketing/selling him/herself in one way or another.  From the six year old kid with the lemonade stand, to Sears, Penneys, or Victorias Secret, and Dell Computers, anybody that sells a product uses direct marketing tactics.  Even Wal-Mart and Microsoft are direct marketers, very good ones I might add.  Ted is a genius in this regard.  This book was not only good, it was Outstanding.  Oh, one other thing about this book which may discourage some readers is the blatant over-use of advertisement of Teds personal ads on Teds own books.  It is very annoying, to say the least.  Ted Nicholas does, however, walk his talk.  I'm sure that along with the wording, the persistent and repetitive use of his brand of advertising have sold millions of dollars worth of merchandise.  I have learned a lot from reading this book, and I have this motto, &quot;Learn something new each day and keep the wolves away&quot;.  Always keep an open mind as you read.  This book is one to read and keep handy for future reference.	2000-12-27
