Unfortunately, I was disappointed again.  While the book does do a wonderful job of transporting the reader to a small town in New York during the Depression, it does a less than masterful job of solving the mystery in the book. <br /> <br />If you have not read the book, you may wish to skip the rest of my review as it will not tell you whodunnit, but will give away some of the plot.   <br /> <br />The story opens with Lily and Robert having gotten yet another part-time job - this one at the nursing home up the road.  The first day that both of them are working there, a crochety patient is suffocated to death in his bed.  The odd thing is that the patient had slipped into a coma and according to Miss Twibell, the proprietor of the home, would have probably passed away that day regardless.  While this detail is constantly mentioned throughout the book, the resolution does not explain the need for the patient to be murdered when he would have died anyway.  There are many unresolved details in the book that are probably there as red herrings, however instead of being neatly explained later, they are just left hanging at the end of the book.  I don't know if Ms. Churchill originally intended for another character to be the murderer or not, but I feel the book could have been much more entertaining from a mystery perspective had she chosen another character for the villain. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a entertaining and diverting read with a secondary mystery, this book would be fine.  However, if you are expecting a rollicking mystery with a twist, skip it.  Not Ms. Churchill's best - not even close.	2005-03-04

If you go into this book expecting your normal chick lit novel, you'll be disappointed.  This novel doesn't even aspire that high.  What it does aspire to be is raucously funny, incredibly sexy (keep a fan and some iced tea handy) and a very quick read.<br />I agree with those who said the ending was a disappointment - it definitely was.  I can think of lots of other ways to wrap this book up that would have been immensely more satisfying than its own ending.  But with that exception, what fun!<br />Completely different from SMART VS. PRETTY.	2003-12-29

Hope's parents packed her up and moved her off to Tennessee from New Jersey, hoping to save her from the fate of drugs and suicide which befell her brother Heath. So Jessica has to deal with the rest of her clique, whom she and Hope referred to as the \\"Clueless Crew\\" by herself. The Clueless Crew is pretty much that - only interested in boys and clothes and already pretty well-versed in sex & drinking. Jessica isn't particularly fond of this lifestyle, but she still hangs around with these folks, basically because she doesn't have any other friends.<br />Jessica also tangles with her parents - her father who is only interested in her track meets and in following her on her runs and her mother, who gets along better with her sister Bethany, especially now that they are planning her wedding.<br />Jessica is a bit more self-involved than say... Mia Thermopolis, but that's okay. She grows up and learns more about the value of friendship in this novel and I, for one, enjoyed watching it unfold.	2003-03-03

He's written about her in a national women's magazine, Moxie and what's worse, he referred to her as \\"a larger woman\\" and called her \\"Lewinsky-esque\\". Cannie knows she's not petite, but she really didn't care to see it in print. And what's worse, when he wrote the article, she thought they were \\"taking a break\\", not \\"broken up\\". (I thought about Ross and Rachel when I heard this part!) Needless to say, they do break up after the fact, but unfortunately, Cannie comes to realize that Bruce (her ex) really understood her after all and she begins to wish they had not broken up.<br />I can't reveal more or I will be giving away information that will spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that this is not a typical chick-lit novel. Some much deeper themes are dealt with here and the romance is not the core of the novel. You will sympathize with Cannie and cheer for her and you will also wish she'd quit being such an idiot! One thing about this novel that I didn't like is that there is a sub-plot that seems very important, but it's just sort of left by the wayside as the novel comes to its end. However, I do recommend this novel and will be reading more by Ms. Weiner!	2003-03-03

Genesis 34 tells her story, but Dinah says that story does not portray the exact picture of what happen. The indication in Genesis 34 is that Dinah was raped by a prince of Shechem and then the king offered a bride-price for her to her father. However, her brothers were insulted and felt that their sister had been treated as a whore, so they demanded that the prince, the king and all the men in Shechem should be circumcised in order for the prince to be able to take Dinah for his bride. The king agreed to this, but two days after the city's circumcision, Dinah's brothers came in and killed all the men in the city. Dinah's story ends there in the Bible. <br />The Red Tent begins with Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah as young girls/women, at the time Jacob comes to their camp to find a wife. It continues through the marriages, the births of the children and then Dinah begins to tell her own story. I won't go into detail about what happens in the palace with the prince, because that would spoil the story. However, once the prince has died, Dinah flees her family and travels to Egypt, where she lives out the rest of her life. <br />In this retelling, readers will recognize scenes from Genesis, such as Leah becoming Jacob's bride ahead of Rachel, Jacob's struggle at the river Jabbok and Joseph's becoming a ruler in Egypt. However, The Red Tent tells these stories in a slightly different way. They are all told from Dinah's perspective or from her mothers' perspective. Having never really given much thought to the story of Dinah, I found this book quite entertaining and VERY thought-provoking. Re-reading Genesis 34, I found that Dinah's account of her time in the palace in Shechem does not contradict the Bible. So, read the story with a thoughtful mind and heart.<br />Ms. Diamant has a remarkable way of making the past come to life and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing style and her characters.	2003-02-26

I LOVED all the anecdotes and stories about her mom, The Cutest Boy in the World and the rest of her family and friends, but unfortunately the &quot;Cookbook&quot; in the title is apt. I'd say 2/3 of the book is devoted to recipes. And unfortunately, most of the recipes are for foods that would cause you to gain 5 lbs just by looking at them, let alone eating them. Nevertheless, I am inclined to try some of them, just because they are so darned strange, yet strangely wonderful - a chocolate cake where one of the main ingredients is Coca-Cola? Must try, just for the novelty of it!	2003-02-24

She's never been married and has no children. Sure, she doesn't speak to her family, hasn't for two years, and the Great Love of her Life hasn't been heard from since they were both 10. Obviously, Shelby's a bit on the touchy side.<br />So when her estranged sister Lauren calls early one morning to let Shelby know her father and step-mother/aunt (don't ask) have been run over by an errant landscaper and she must come home to Long Island immediately, needless to say she is less than thrilled.<br />Things get worse before they get better in this bizarre tale of family, long-lost love and karma (yeah - Shelby's long-dead mother plays a major role from her perspective looking down on it all), but of course it all works out in the end.<br />The first part of this novel seemed like it might have been edited by a different person than the rest of the novel. It's not very coherent and things seem to happen behind the reader's back leaving you re-reading sections a couple of times to make sure you got what happened. But once you get through the first part, it's smooth sailing. I was a bit put off by all the talk of karma and astrology and what-have-you, but if you can brush that aside, this is a cute read.	2003-02-19

Above her lives a \\"crazy old man\\" who is training a mice circus and below her live two former theatre stars, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible who have several small dogs and read tea leaves. Coraline is dealing with summer boredom by exploring her new home as her parents are busy with their own lives during the day. One day, she finds a door in the parlor (saved for \\"best\\" as her mother says) that goes nowhere - a brick wall is all that faces her when her mother unlocks the door. Her mother explains that there is an empty flat on the other side that has yet to be let. Meantime, Coraline visits with the neighbors, all of whom warn her of impending danger. One day she discovers that the door in the parlor is unlocked and instead of the brick wall that had been there before, there is a corridor - so she goes exploring and discovers the danger of which the neighbors spoke.<br />Gaiman seems to be attempting to teach a moral lesson here and it is well received. \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" is certainly part of it, but it runs even deeper than that. Despite some overtly obvious clues in the story, it is still suspeseful. I found it to be well-written and a nice addition to the canon of children's fantasy.	2003-02-19

Okay, it's just February, but this book is the best book I've read this year. Terrific, wonderful, witty, brainy, smart... I could go on and on with the adjectives. I picked it up wanting a mindless read, but I got a smart woman with a great voice, of whose work I want to read more.<br />Ruby Capote is a columnist for a Boston newspaper who has a &quot;safe&quot; 3-year relationship with Doug. However, she wants more. She decides, knowing that &quot;happiness is not for cowards&quot;, to take a risk and send her resume to The New York News. This paper doesn't currently have a columnist like her, so she reasons that no one will even have to get fired for her to get hired. After some weeks with no response from the News, she decides to get creative. This pays off and she's soon on her way to New York.<br />Girls' Poker Night is about taking risks and being open to love. The title refers to a ritual that Ruby had in college and resumes when she moves to New York - playing poker with her girlfriends, whose stories are subplots of the novel. I collected multiple quotes from the book - something I don't normally do. I anxiously await Ms. Davis' next novel!	2003-02-16

Merrileigh \\"Merry\\" Kramer is new to Amhearst, PA and has been working for The News, the local newspaper for just about three months when she finds a body in her car trunk. Of course, she must write a story on this and so she does. She ALSO has to write a puff piece on a local artist, Curtis Carlyle, whose show is opening the next evening. She and Curt hit it off rather well and she runs into him again the next night when they wind up being shot at. Various mishaps continue to occur until, of course, Merry stumbles onto the murderer.<br />One of the major things I enjoyed about this story was the humor. It was a unique style of humor that occasionally made me laugh out loud. I didn't feel as though I was being pandered to, which was nice. The humor was truly humorous. Also, this is definitely a Christian mystery, but I didn't feel as though I was beaten over the head with religion. Merry is just your average twenty-something with relationship issues, flaws, etc. She does rely on God, but she also makes mistakes - and not the HUGE mistakes that you sometimes find in Christian novels - just your average, everyday kinds of stupid things people do. I really appreciated that!<br />I welcome this series debut and will be reading the others in the series.	2003-02-14

While I do like tennis, I don't play and don't watch it enough for the tennis stuff to be all that interesting to me. I thought that the book would have been much more entertaining had I been older in the eighties and remembered most of the people he mentions. It is very \\"Oprah-esque\\" in his justifications of why he did the things he did, but I do think he has some great ideas for the future of tennis and the USTA would do well to listen to him. After all, it is obvious that tennis has lost many fans since he left the sport. I left the book feeling that McEnroe still feels he has something to prove at least to himself, if not the world. And that is unfortunate, because at this point in his life, he should be able to just sit back and enjoy what he has worked so hard to obtain.	2003-02-13

Harriett Grey is just your average London girl, though she has inherited half a house in Putney which she is living in with her best friends Sally & Jacko, Sally's infant son Tom, & Frieda, a Swedish girl who doesn't play a large part in the novel. The story begins with Harriett's friend Rosie telling her that Nina, an acquaintance they were at school with and hated because she was Little Miss Perfect and liked to lord it over them, has just been dumped by her boyfriend and she's put a private detective onto him because she just knows there's another woman. Harriett tells Rosie that she is the other woman and then the story goes into flashback mode to tell the story of how Harriett came to steal Nina's boyfriend! Or did she?<br />This is not your average chick lit novel! Oh sure, the basic story line is there, but Ms. Young does such an excellent job of fleshing out the story and creating unique and intriguing characters that you can forgive the fact that there's not a huge twist on the usual plot. Ms. Young does an excellent job on her secondary characters - giving side plots that are almost as interesting as the main plot! Way to go and can't wait for the next one!	2003-02-12

The second family, with his mistress Renee, lives in Orlando. As the story begins, Reggie has decided to come back to Miami full-time and give up his second family in Orlando. The book goes on to unfold multiple secrets that all come unraveled when Reggie decides to come clean.<br />When I first started reading this book, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. There is lots of gratuitous sex and quite a bit of cursing - not what I usually gravitate towards. But I perservered and I am glad that I finished the book. The ending (part 3) was worth waiting for.

This particular month finds Maggie ready to give birth, Roxanne still with her married with children boyfriend and Candice having just broken up with her co-worker boyfriend, Justin. Candice recognizes their waitress as a girl she was at school with and says her name, just as she realizes that her recognition was probably best kept to herself as the waitress, Heather Trelawney, had to leave school when her family lost all their money due to Candice's swindling father. It strikes good-hearted Candice that she can try and make amends to Heather by helping her get a job at the magazine. Unfortunately, her good deeds don't stop there and as the saying goes, \\"No good deed goes unpunished.\\"<br />Follow these friends through the ups and downs of motherhood, affairs, death and evil machinations and enjoy every page of it.	2003-02-08

Unwilling to give up taking care of her son, she runs off with him in the middle of the night, leaving behind a brokenhearted lover, Linc, her son's distressed stepmother, Peggy, and an indifferent ex-husband, Jim. She begins to make herself a new life in Annapolis, MD, light-years away from her former home in Boulder, CO. Yet she feels as though her whole existence is temporary and is constantly looking over her shoulder. Enter artist Adam Soria and his sister Jessie. Adam's wife and two children were killed seven months prior in a drunk driving accident. He and Jessie have been overcome by grief ever since, but with the introduction of Susanna (now known as Kim) and Tyler (now known as Cody) into their lives, things seem to be looking up.<br />Yet strange things are happening. Two bombings have occurred in Annapolis and Kim's new computer had a file on it with a list of the locations where the bombings occurred as well as more locations for apparent bombings-to-be. She returns from a trip only to find that her apartment has been broken into and her computer left on. Her brakes are tampered with. Obviously, someone knows Kim has the file.<br />Though this book contains many elements of romance, there is lots of suspense to flesh out the plot. It took me a while to get started, but then once I was into the book, the pages seemed to turn themselves. I am not sure if I will read more by Ms. Chamberlain or not because I was over halfway through the book before I was sure I would finish it. However, it was a good read.	2003-02-08

Mel Fuller is a gossip columnist for the secondary newspaper in New York City, the New York Journal. She wants to move on to hard news, but is having a hard time convincing her boss that she should be allowed to do this. She has just broken up with her boyfriend, star reporter Aaron Spender, because she found out that he cheated on her with another reporter while they were on location in Kabul. She also has a propensity for being late for work and the novel begins with her latest tardy. It turns out that she is late for work because her neighbor has been assaulted in her apartment and Mel, being a sweet \\"girl next door\\" type from the Midwest, feels it is her obligation to look out for her neighbor as well as her neighbor's pets. Eventually, she tracks down her neighbor's only living relative, one Max Friedlander, famous fashion photographer and he assures her that he will be there as soon as possible to take over the pets' care. What follows is hilarious and romantic - definitely a different sort of romance. <br />What a preciously cute novel! Written entirely in e-mail format, this romance come mystery was a great read. Though it falls more into the classification of \\"beach book\\" rather than \\"great literature\\", there is no reason that it can't be read and enjoyed! Due to the e-mail format of the book, there are several first-person narrators. It is neat to get a feel for what is happening from several individual perspectives. Instead of reading what is going on \\"as it happens\\", the reader hears about things before and after they happen.<br />Though the book could have benefited from a bit more proof-reading, the mistakes aren't enough to take away from the readers' enjoyment. Mel's refreshingly non-whiny personality is a stark contrast to some of the usual heroines of chick-lit. Way to go Meggin - you have written a real winner here!	2003-02-01

This is a continuation of the Vampire Chronicles, but it brings in some of the witches from the Mayfair series. This is Anne Rice back and as good as ever! After reading Merrick, I was excited that there seemed to be a storyline to the Vampire Chronicles again. Blood and Gold followed and I wondered where the storyline had gone. Blackwood Farm brings back the storyline of the persecution of the vampires by the Talamasca, but yet it does nothing with the storyline - nothing that the ending of Merrick seemed to promise.<br />However, Ms. Rice is almost back to her usual storytelling self and the story of Quinn Blackwood is a good one. It's almost a family saga. My only other complaint with this book is that the ending is rushed and does not wrap itself up very well. I am not sure if Ms. Rice is planning a sequel to this book or not - I have heard that this may be her last Mayfair/Vampire novel, but who knows? This book does not wrap anything up, so the possibility of more books is always there.	2003-01-31

The main character, Donald Zinkoff, is clumsy, loud, laughs when he shouldn't and throws up often because of a stomach problem. In general, he's a geek. The novel opens with his first day of first grade and continues through his sixth grade year. Zinkoff is not immediately a loser - in fact, there is a moment when he is a hero, but alas, it is not to continue. Around fourth grade, his classmates discover that he is \\"different\\" (which I thought was a little bit late - I was already a geek in 3rd grade) and begin to whisper behind his back.<br />Mr. Spinelli's obvious intent is to make kids reconsider those they have marginalized as losers (this book is a bit like Stargirl in that respect, but it is geared towards a younger audience), but it does not succeed as Stargirl did. It climaxes in a strange scene that takes place during a snowstorm, but this scene for me was very anticlimactic and rather ridiculous.

Also, I found Marius' life to be incredibly boring until he got further into the present time. At that point, it seemed almost like Anne got sick of writing the book and she wrapped it up quickly and rather bizarrely.<br />Marius is telling his story to a vampire we are introduced to, one made by Maharet, Thorne.  His story seems as if it would be interesting, but alas, only tidbits are thrown out there and then his story is used to wrap up the novel.  Why do we even care about this guy?<br />Of course I am going to continue to read the Chronicles - unfortunately I've been sucked in!	2003-01-21
US	52534343	RGW0UPH8WTMSH	1401300057	930186214	Firehouse	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A book about 9/11/01 that deserves to be read	Mr. Halberstam, known well for his books about history, has written a little book about 9/11 that will hopefully remain long after most of the other 9/11 novels are ancient history. This novel tells the story of Engine 40, Ladder 35 in Midtown Manhattan, a firehouse that lost 12 of 13 men who went to the World Trade Center.<br />Each fireman is described - what role he had in the firehouse and how he came to be a fireman. The story of the 13th fireman, Kevin Shea, the one who lived, is also told. Some have criticized this story because it leaves out any negatives, character flaws, etc. that these men had. I dispute this as one in particular is characterized as a \\"human cactus\\". And why, I ask, should we want to learn the things people disliked about the men who died? They did die as heroes, even though this book illustrates that heroes is probably the last thing that any of these men would have wanted to be called. They were just doing their jobs.<br />The book also goes into some detail about the families of these men and how they reacted after the tragedy when they came to realize that their husband/son/father would not be coming home.<br />Out of all the books written about September 11th, this is one that deserves to stand the test of time. It wasn't written in a hurry so that it would sell tons of copies and make lots of money - instead it was published in May 2002, long after many books had been out and the publishing craze seemed to be over. It also serves as a reminder of what happened that day. Eventually, 9/11/01 will be just another date, hard as it seems to believe right now. Eventually it will be like 12/7/41 and children will learn of it, but not fully understand and appreciate the tragedy that occurred that day. If this book is still around, I will recommend it be read by everyone who doesn't remember that day, so they can understand that lives were lost that day - lives of real people.	2003-01-19

Well, he's finally finished and this is the book.<br />Fans of the series may recognize many of the stories in the book as having been told to JMQ in other novels. However, I didn't remember a lot of them and I love the idea of having all those great Moose County legends collected in one place.<br />This is a quick read - most stories are about three pages long - and a delightful one. It's good for picking up while in line somewhere or just reading in one sitting. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who has not read at least one or two of the &quot;Cat Who&quot; mystery series - I don't know how much sense it would make!	2003-01-19
US	52534343	RYZ0L1S8LFZ4E	0310411610	215800381	Eden's Gate	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A good Christian thriller	&quot;Eden's Gate&quot; opens with an archeologist on a solo expedition discovering an ancient skeleton which he knows will be an outstanding find. However, this archeologist doesn't live long enough to find out just how old this skeleton is. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his disappearance (for only the reader knows he's dead) lead the FBI to begin an investigation into his disappearance. Meanwhile, the American Archeological Society (AAS) has to find a replacement for him on the dig he was supposed to be working on. Enter Dr. Ben Lawrence, a Christian archaeologist, not to mention the man who lost the grant for the dig originally when the dead man decided he wanted it.<br />Dr. Lawrence has been having some strange dreams recently - involving a mysterious mist and a lovely woman. While he's trying to figure out these dreams, he's also trying to figure out if it's God's will for him to take over on the dig. After determining that it is, he takes off for southern Turkey to take over the dig.<br />What follows involves the PPT (Turkish version of the FBI), CIA, and US Special Forces. You'll just have to read it to find out how it all works out. There's a little bit of romance and a lot of action!<br />If you have even a passing interest in archaeology, you will enjoy this book. The writing is not flowery - it's straightforward and to the point - all about plot advancement. Though the book is thick, it's a fast and exciting read.<br />&quot;Eden's Gate&quot; is a Christian fiction novel that reads like a Michael Crichton thriller. Crichton's novels are characterized by extensive research into his subjects and a thrilling plotline. Mr. Lane has definitely done his research on both archaeology and the Middle East. Much of this story takes place on the border between Turkey and Iraq and some of it even takes place in Iraq. With things the way they are in the world today, I found this book quite fascinating.	2003-01-19

Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum is back and just as funny as ever. This holiday novel is a step off the beaten path from the usual Plums though. A little bit of fantasy is thrown in, just for good measure I guess. Add some \\"little people\\" donning fake pointy ears to resemble elves, an FTA who bears a strange resemblance to Santa Claus and a guy named Diesel who just \\"appears\\" in Stephanie's kitchen one morning and you have a definite recipe for hilarity.

Luther Krank, disgusted by the amount he and his family spent on last Christmas and how little they have to show for it, decides that his family will skip Christmas this year and instead go on a cruise. After all, daughter Blair has gone to Peru to work in the Peace Corps, so it will just be Luther and Nora. Why shouldn't they save all that money and use it on something more enjoyable and relaxing? The Kranks don't put up a tree, don't send Christmas cards, don't have their traditional Christmas Eve party. Their neighbors and friends are incredulous, especially when the Kranks don't even put Frosty on their roof, a neighborhood tradition. However, skipping Christmas isn't as easy as Luther thinks it will be and when the unexpected happens, he finds out what Christmas is really all about.<br />While entertaining and a definite departure for Grisham, this novel left something to be desired. I thought that the Kranks' spending on Christmas in the past was WAY over the top (get real - $300 for Christmas cards?!?!?) and their idea to skip Christmas was fine, but they went overboard with it. The reactions of the neighbors on Hemlock Street was also beyond believable. I found them to be just a bunch of nosy meddlers, and annoying, to boot!<br />This is a book to check out of the library - skip buying it.	2003-01-19

Kate is a mom who works outside the home - and boy, does she work. But, she feels that she has to prove not only is she an outstanding employee (she's a fund manager in London's City) but she's also Supermom. Hilarious and also sad episodes follow. Very poignant, yet humourous look at a working mom's life.<br />Wow - what a great book! I read this just after I finished Tending Roses by Lisa Wingate and though the tone and writing styles are polar opposites, the message is essentially the same. As a late twentysomething with no kids, I am devouring these books about women who are trying to \\"have it all\\". I certainly recommend this book!	2003-01-19

She sings \\"Happy Birthday\\" to each student when it's their birthday. She leaves a token on every desk in her classes on holidays. And she leaves anonymous presents to random people in the town of Mica. In short, she's bizarre, at least to the students at MAHS.

She weaves a wonderful story and even tosses in some plot twists!<br />Bubbles Yablonsky is a divorced single mom, living on the \\"wrong\\" side of Lehigh, PA (based loosely on Bethlehem, PA). Her husband, \\"Dan the Man\\", divorced her to marry up and now lives in a snooty neighborhood with his new wife, though he can't seem to escape the fact that the law firm he works for advertises on cardboard inserts in the telephone book. Her daughter, Jane, is bright and gets along great with Bubbles, though she looks every bit the part of of the rebellious teenager with her Kool-Aid colored hair and black lipstick. Bubbles, armed with a degree in journalism from Two Guys Community College (so-called because it is located in the former Two Guys Department Store) is struggling to make a better life for herself and her daughter. As a freelance reporter for the local newspaper, she gets a call to cover the story of a bridge-jumper and that's where the adventures begin. After covering the possible suicide, Bubbles and AP photog Steve Stiletto take off to rescue Bubbles' mom from jail (long story). The trouble they run into along the way is what really begins the mystery.<br />Ms. Strohmeyer has interspersed some really neat beauty recipes throughout the story. While some might consider this gimmicky and extraneous, I thought it was cute and I kept trying to figure out which of the beauty treatments mentioned in the story would be in a recipe at the end of the chapter.<br />Bubbles is perky, fun and bubbly and I will read more of her novels!	2003-01-18

He also talks about his father's heart surgery, how his wife's grandmother makes little notes about what happened each day and has done so for years, a Leadership Jackson trip into the inner city and becoming the father of twins.<br />Anyone who is from the South, lives in the South or is just a fan will appreciate this quick read.	2003-01-18

It is so obvious that she was very deeply in love with her husband and I wish they could have worked it out because they went through so much together.<br />Catty Ms. Drescher is not.

This sequel, as the first book, follows a year in Harmony. Dale Hinshaw is still getting on Sam's (and everyone else's) nerves and has a new idea for witnessing - scripture eggs. Deena Morrison, owner of Legal Grounds, returns and plays a bigger part as does Wayne Fleming.<br />I enjoyed this book even more than the original. Instead of the vignettes of small-town life that the original had, the sequel follows a more traditional storyline and I found that the characters came even more to life for me in this fashion!	2003-01-13
US	52534343	R279F4X5CPR2EC	0446528307	961851587	Leaving Atlanta	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Interesting novel about a sad time in Atlanta's history	I grew up in Rome, GA during the time period when more than 20 African-American children were kidnapped and murdered on Atlanta's southside. I remember hating to watch the news every night because I dreaded hearing about another child being abducted or another body being found. The author of this novel grew up in Atlanta in the area where the children were taken at the same time it was going on. I can't imagine what her experience must have been like, though I can only imagine that it is similar to what is portrayed in her book.<br />The book tells the story of a 5th grade class during this time period. Three different classmates tell the story - La Tasha, a girl on the borderline of popularity; Rodney, a boy who is shy & sweet and therefore picked on; and Octavia, a definite outcast who is called \\"Watusi\\" by her classmates because her skin is so dark. The same story is not told over and over, but begins with LaTasha's story, continues with Rodney's and ends with Octavia's. I enjoyed this plot device very much.<br />One thing that really bothered me about the story is that the perspective was definitely that of a child. The children do not realize that their parents are doing the best they can. They do not realize the depths of their parents' love for them. I know that this is the way children are, but I still hated to read it. I thought that some of the children's reactions to their parents might have been a little over the top. I remember being angry at my mom about one thing or another, but the feelings of \\"she lies\\" or \\"she's a horrible person\\" only lasted a few hours, not all the time.<br />Overall, this is a very good story. Ms. Jones does not really postulate about the killer's identity except to have the characters discuss that they think it must be white men and many think that it is someone posing as a person of authority such as a policeman or fireman. In her end notes, she states that Wayne Williams was believed to be the killer, but that many Atlantansbelieve the killer is still at large. I don't know what I believe. It makes sense that it was Wayne Williams because the killings stopped after he was arrested. However, if \\"the real killer\\" believed they could get away with the murders, they might stop just to pin the blame on Williams. It's a complicated case and still has elements of racial tension.	2003-01-13

I could type the entire book in this section and save you the trouble of checking it out, but I won't, because that would be copyright infringement. But this book is less than 1000 words. There isn't even a moral to the story - it's just a story about several of the Mitford residents building snowmen in front of the stores on Main Street. This is SUCH an obvious attempt to milk the Mitford series for more money without having to actually write another novel. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I wasn't expecting a long story, but I was expecting something to happen! Philip Gulley writes short stories in all of his books and each of them have a meaning or moral and most aren't that much longer than this book. Seems to me that it would have been easy enough to write a short story with a moral or lesson, but alas, no. Read it IN the library - don't even bother checking the book out.	2003-01-09

In this novel, five women are part of a book club that meets monthly to discuss their last read. The five women are all going through major life crises - Eve's husband just died suddenly, Doris is beginning to realize that her marriage is dead, Gabriella's husband has just lost his job, Annie is having difficulty becoming pregnant for the first time and Midge is realizing how lonely she is. <br />I enjoyed the novel, but felt that some of the characters were extraneous. Gabriella's character is not fleshed out at all and Midge's is just barely. The story focuses mainly on Eve with Doris and Annie's stories as the supporting plots. The author could have left out Gabriella and Midge completely and made the book a bit shorter (but not much).<br />The book club seems to read classics only, which makes sense because Ms. Monroe uses quotes from that month's book to introduce her chapters and the quote winds up applying to the chapter. I think this device wouldn't have been as striking if the books hadn't been ones that most people have at least heard of. <br />I read this for an online book club I'm in. Not a book that I would normally pick up on my own, but it was a great introduction to a good author. I have added more Mary Alice Monroe books to my wish list at Amazon!	2003-01-09

The documentary will show, through the many faces of the restaurant, the development of Dublin into a modern, cosmopolitan city.  The book begins with how Ella came to do the documentary, which is a strange tale as this will be her first film ever and is only being done because of a tragedy that has occurred in her life.  Interspersed throughout the tale are short stories of characters who have something to do with Quentins.  Though as a general rule I am not a huge fan of short stories, I really enjoyed the format of Quentins because there were characters who continued throughout the short stories and thus brought a continuity to the whole book.<br />Many have said that they thought Binchy should have just written a book of short stories if that is what she wanted to write, but I disagree.  I thought this book was written in quite an interesting and entertaining style and I really enjoyed reading it.  I did notice that there seemed to be some problems with the timeline of the stories (the baby that never grows up, for instance), but if you can ignore that, the book is simply an enjoyable read.  Enough action and drama to satisfy most any reader and lots of wonderful characters!	2003-01-04

Apparently, the narrator, Ibn Fadlan, was real enough and did travel to the Northlands around the time period when this novel is set, but Crichton wrote the novel on a bet that he could make an entertaining story out of Beowulf.  Personally, I thought Beowulf to be pretty entertaining on its own (even in 11th grade, when I read it), but this adaptation is also a good read.  The movie later made from the novel, &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; with Antonio Banderas as Ibn Fadlan is remarkably true to the story, then again, maybe not so remarkably when you note that Michael Crichton was a producer.  At any rate, a good novel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone!	2003-01-04

Abarat is the first novel in an apparent series for young adults about another world, reachable from a field in Minnesota. Candy Quackenbush, a teen from a dysfunctional family, is the protagonist. One day, after yet another bad day at school, she just walks out of class and keeps walking into this field, only to discover some characters from the other world and wind up going there - only to begin to realize that she may have been there before.<br />Clive Barker's first foray into young adult literature shows an attempt to write for teens (and perhaps capitalize on the Harry Potter market), but not quite getting it right. It is painfully obvious that this book is part of a series and the cliffhanger is on a cliff that is only about five feet high. I will read more of this series, but if another book doesn't appear, I won't be disappointed.	2003-01-04

However, by page ten, I was engrossed. The storyline was excellent and suspenseful. There were even elements of humor and flashes of pure joy. Unfortunately, I felt that the ending was contrived and seemed as if it had been written by a completely different person. <br />The story begins with a 14-year-old girl, Susie Salmon, telling about how she was raped and murdered by a neighbor. The neighbor's guilt is known by the reader throughout the novel, so that element of mystery is taken away. The story is told by Susie of her family and friends' reaction to her death over an eight-year period following her murder. Susie also talks about her heaven, where she is. Her heaven features things that she wishes for - the high school she never went to, a duplex where she can live with her roommate, Holly. <br />Overall, the story holds interest, however it is literary and full of symbolism and all those things we learned about in English class. If you are looking for a mindless read, this is not it. But do give it a chance even if it's not the type of book you typically read.	2002-11-14

Her reading is at best whiny and annoying rather than representing the strength of character that the various players in the story posess.  I believe that Jan Maxwell also read another MHC novel that I heard recently and I came away with the feeling that the characters were all whiny and useless, basically just lucky to get themselves out of the scrapes they got into, rather than strong and decisive as I used to feel about MHC's characters when I simply read the books.

I really didn't see too much of myself in Charlie, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't sympathize with her to a degree.<br />She dates Daniel, the office stud as well as, it turns out, the office compulsive liar.  As you can imagine, things in this relationship turn out badly and her old stand-by at home isn't there to make it all better when she needs him.  So she goes to Scotland to visit her mother's college roommate who simply lets her talk and puts her to work on her sheep farm.<br />The ending of this book is rushed and the &quot;relationship&quot; that Charlie has while in Scotland is remarkably thin and undeveloped.  I think it may be a case of overediting.  I had to go back a few pages to make sure of the characters I was reading about.<br />However, overall, this is a great beach book or time-waster - good for a rainy afternoon.	2002-03-13

Okay, I've read \\"Altar Ego\\" and \\"Foetal Attraction\\" by Kathy Lette and I was expecting more of the same, but in short story format when I picked up this book.  However, that was NOT what I got.  Frankly, I'm not sure what I got.  None of the stories remotely resembled the other two books of hers I've read.  The stories range from a one-sided conversation with a washed-up soccer groupie to the diary of a teenager who runs away from home with her cat to live on a commune.  The longest story in the book is the most interesting - the story of two girls and a guy living together in an abandoned house in the bad part of Sydney.  (Yes, these stories take place in Australia.)  I'm not sure if I can recommend this book even as a time-waster, though I did read it all the way through.

However, this book is a bit different. For one, the only real thing about this book that tells you it's a diary (besides the title) is the fact that it has dates. It is not written as though Amy (the \\"mad bride\\" of the title) is writing to her diary, it reads more like a normal fiction book, with the exception of dialogue reading as lines from a movie or play. That being said, this is an interesting book, with occasional flashes of humor, but only one real laugh-out-loud moment that I can remember. As I appreciate humor, I tend to judge books such as this by the number of laugh-out-loud moments it has. It has some slight plot twists, but not the ones you would predict. Overall, it's an interesting and diverting read, but of this particular genre, I've read much better.	2002-03-13

As such, most BCRMs are compared to the \\"original\\" (which BJD actually wasn't).  However, I believe that Jemima J can stand on its own.  It makes some major changes to the genre - the main character is obese, part of the action takes place in California, etc.  I found this to be a really enjoyable book!	2002-03-13

I did find the pacing somewhat off - the romance that normally &quot;pans out&quot; at the end of this type of book isn't really here - the little romance that is there is not fleshed out enough that it's really believable, but I still enjoyed the read.  There are some completely hilarious moments and I really don't think the puns are bad.  I didn't kick myself for laughing at them.  I think it's a rather original form of humor for fiction.  The &quot;bad guys&quot; get their comeuppance and the &quot;good guys&quot; end up well.  Don't give too much credence to the one-star review if you are someone who reads for fun.  This is worth your time.	2002-03-13

I simply adore good reads with a little romance and intrigue - where the good guys win, bad guys lose and screwed up folks get sorted out.  This book does all that and wraps up nicely.  Megan Silver is an unknown writer who has a flash of inspiration and writes a great screenplay.  Now she just has to get it published.  She moves from San Francisco to Los Angeles (though the book does this rather strangely - all of a sudden she is working at a chicken joint in LA and you have to page back to make sure of which character she is) to try to get her screenplay sold.  Roxana Felix is a spoiled, self-absorbed supermodel turned wannabe actress.  Eleanor Marshall is the new president of a failing movie studio.  All of these women have something to prove and they all come together in a very fun, fast-paced read.	2002-03-13

I love the books, though sometimes they seem to get all caught up in nothing and make for tedious reading.  However, there are great moments to be felt and I, a life-long Baptist, feel the sudden need to find an  Episcopalian church with a rector like Father Tim.	1999-09-22

Kendall and Jones almost seem to have that &quot;we haven't messed up  much&quot; attitude and speak to that audience, whereas Hammond gets down  and dirty and acknowledges that things do happen...  Read this book, but  also read &quot;What to Do Until Love Finds You&quot;.	1998-11-17
