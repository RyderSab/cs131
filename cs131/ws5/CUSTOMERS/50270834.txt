I was expecting an entertain read, but this dark epic blew away my expectations with a riviting narrative that took me into the heart of a fresh and dangerous fantasy world.  It follows the adventures of Tarrant Hawkins, a young warrior who soon sees more action than those twice his age.  He plays a pivotal role that first is observer, hero, and final, witness to the final tragedy that ends this novel.  Though some points are hammered home, vivid characters and good sense of the horrors of warfare interact with a world that deserves more exploration.  When the next book of the DragonCrown saga hits NZ bookshelves, I certainly while be grabbing it.  Of note, I will mention a certain apprenhension about the ending, which unfortunately feels artifical and does not fit the characters involved (the villianess of the piece gives reasons, but they too are artifical and unconvincing.)  I am not complaining about the darkness, as the downbeat fit perfectly to the tone of the story, but a little more foreshadowing would have helped (especially involving Seethe.)  Otherwise, Stackpole has proven himself a fantasy author to watch out for.	2001-10-22

It concerns what happens when superstar Todd Pickett is disfigured during a botched plastic surgery, and is moved into a seeming deserted mansion to recover.  There, he is seduced by the mansions sexy (and immortal) owner, and introduced to the ancient horrors that live in the basement.  <br />Out to save him, obsessed fan Tammy Lauper (a character all us fans can identify with to some degree,) who in turn discovers that the ghosts of old Hollywood haunt the mansion's grounds, and that she must go the extra distance to save the man she idolizes so much.  A man who may not want saving.<br />Irreverent, amusing and epic, this is both classic Clive Barker and an interesting departure from his norm.  It is great to see such a lovingly rendered heroine in Tammy (who gets to do many things she only dreamed of,) and even the vain Todd is likable (especially when dealing with his disgust at his own shallowness.)  I especially loved the openning passages, which rang with the same portents as his much earlier Hellbound Heart.  <br />My only grip is the second climax, which while it entertaining, seems a little tacked on.  But then again, it may just be Clive's little dig at all those tacked on Hollywood endings.  Don't you just Love them.	2001-10-05

After the release of Kathy Tyer's Balance Point, I have found each subsequent Star Wars novel to be disappointing.  To be fair, the NJO books are more a case of central plot that bad writing, but I am also inspired by The Phantom Menace, and want to immerse myself in the old Republic and the ways of the Jedi.  Though Darth Maul's ill conceived novel was utter trash, James Luceno has come through with a ripping good yarn that delves into the most complicated parts of Episode I - the politics, and how Palpatine  manipulates them.<br />In Cloak, which has to be the ultimate Star Wars politically thriller, Luceno weaves several nefarious plots that threaten to collide, as well as sets up much of the plot to Episode I.  In it, Chancellor Valorum tries to deal both to the greedy Trade Federation and the violent Nebula Front, a terrorised organization, which soon leads to an attempted assassination and the mobilization of the Jedi Council.  At the same time, Palpatine subtly manoeuvrers all around him towards a secret and singular goal.  <br />This book is chock full of intrigue and characters, with enough action thrown in to keep us Jedi fans amused without resorting to Bad Plot Devices like Numerous Dark Jedi and silly SuperTech that Star Wars avoids so well.  Also, many characters from other books show up in amusing cameos.  But the best thing is how Palpatine stars in this book without taking center stage.  Much like the character indeed (I especially love the way both he AND Sideous are dealing with the Front!)  After his exciting entrance into the SW universe with Hero's Trial, Luceno proves himself here to be one of the best SW authors around, rising up into the ranks that contain a select few, including the unbeatable Zahn, Stackpole and Perry.  Hopefully, this will not be Luceno's last stand in the SW galaxy, and that goes double for the world of the old Republic.	2001-10-05

But there were points in this book, points that were almost unreadable, where I had to ponder, &quot;Was he even trying?&quot;  To be fair, I will say the main problem with this novel is the same that plagues all the New Jedi Order series, the Yuzzahn Vong are a boring, one-dimensional foe in an ongoing plot that really bites.  This is usually redeemed by good characterization and interesting side stories.  None of that is here.  Following up from his boring Conquest, Keyes hits us with multiple plots: Luke and Mara prepare for their firstborn; Han, Leia and Jacen raid Vong-friendly ships, Anakin and his annoying girlfriend try to get Corran Horn killed by doing many stupid things; and Jania is duped by the trecherous dark jedi Kyp Durron (who does this with clumsy sexual advances!)Out of all these, the Han and Jacen plot works best, especially with dealling with Jacen's plight over the nature of their raids (the scene in the bar later is hilarious, and closest to classic Keyes.)  The least compelling is the plot I failed to mention, because it should be in this novel, and only serves as setup for more idiotic ploting.  In the end, save yourself some time and skip this novel and go for Troy Dennings Star By Star - hopefully it will be much better.  Still, at least it was better than the appalling Darth Maul - Shadow Hunter.	2001-10-02

Armed with a camera and her quirky attitude, Rune dives into the porn industry and ferrets out clues and suspects ... and once again puts her life in mortal danger.<br />Once again Deaver delivers a compulsively readable novel, but the twists in this one are more guessible than usual, especially the final (whichs shows Rune is kinder to certain people than they deserve) and next to no mention is made of the murders she experienced in the first book.  Still, pretty good.	2001-04-24

Rune is not the usual highly educated, all knowing experts that Deaver has made his name with, but instead a punkish, homeless girl who lives in her own fantasy version of Manhattan.  <br />She is the last person who should investigate a murder, but that is exactly what she does when an old man she has befriended is brutally murdered in what appears to be a professional hit.  Armed with only her spunk and knowledge gleamed from her favourite Nior films, Rune sets out to bring the killers to justice, only to learn that in the real world, there are no ture happy endings.<br />Highly entertaining tale is probably a little too whimsical for many hard-core thriller readers (fans of Deaver's clinical, cynical heroes will be shocked,) but the novel has atmosphere to burn, and the mystery keeps you hooked to the last page.<br />An offbeat treat.	2001-04-24

I tried to keep an open mind when LucasBooks released Shadow Hunter, starring whirlwind of death Darth Maul.  I had just read Dark Horse Comic's awful Maul miniseries and I thought the character was best left to what he did in the movies.  Unfortunately, this novel is not much better than the comics.  And worse, it requires you to lower your I.Q. just to finish it.<br />Not that it is completely hopeless. The two heroes are quite compelling, but you know they are going to die, so why root for them?  Some of the situations are energetic, and at least the cover is nice.<br />But unfortunately, Maul himself is the biggest problem.  He is a fighting machine, nothing more, a henchman and a lackey.  He did not deserve a novel to himself, and no amount of double-bladed saber action will change that.  Having Maul use is saber is a bad idea, anyway.  Wouldn't the Jedi Council discover the Sith if one of their numbers is slashing people up left right and center?  Let alone all evidence points to the first Jedi Maul encountered being Qui-Gon Jinn.  <br />The other problem is Sideous, the cleaver Senator Palpatine. Or rather, the not so cleaver Palpatine in this story, as his plans lack the brilliant edge they did in Episode I, and the only reason they work is because everyone else in this novel is portayed as complete idiots (especially the one-note trade federation.)<br />The Old Republic, the Jedi, and the readers deserve better than this.	2001-04-06

From their debut with the splatter filled Relic to the high adventure Riptide, they have taken B-grade story, infused them with character and scienetific knowhow, and transformed pulp fiction into A-grade thrillers.

Tagging along for the ride and possible scoop, Bill Smithback, intrepid reporter from Relic!

US	50270834	R1V0C06MCOE9JS	039914496X	51899905	Certain Prey	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Number One With A Bullet	What is it about Lucas Davenport that has made him so enduring?  Sure, he's a womanizing, sometimes violent, sharp-shooting top cop, but he's just so damn good at it.  He's larger than life, and that's what makes him so statisfying.  And in this, the tenth novel in a series that refuses to run out of steam, he's as good as ever.  <br />When an insane defense attorney and her gullible hitwoman sidekick go on a killing spree, they soon come to the attention of Davenport, who quite honestly wished it was someone elses problem.  You see, despite knowing whodunnit, Lucas just doesn't have the evidence to arrest them, and he needs a plan to bring them down.  But with someone in the department tipping the killers off at every turn, he has his work cut out for him.<br />Like the previous couple of Prey books, this cracking good novel once again focuses more on the villians that Lucas, but both are interesting in their own way, especially hitwoman Clara Rinker, who makes up for her dimness by being totally thorough, and author Sandford really does a number with the killer's perverse relationship.  The only quibble - the anticlimatic final shootout at Davenport's place.  Why bother?  Otherwise, a top thriller by an author who refuses to let the series slip.	2000-12-29

Here, she returns with a strong, character-driven storyline that finally puts Jacen Solo on track and dares to add depth to the annoyingly shallow Jania.  The twins had lacked true grit for the most part, with Jania being nothing more than another fighter jock and JAcen being a right royal moaner.  But now, Jania has gotten over her brattiness, and Jacen is finally taken the giant step towards manhood he desperately need.<br />Tyers layers all this in a story in which our heroes must deal with the very real problems of refugees and the advancing Vong forces.  And this is the only lapse in the novel.  The Vong, for all their saber rattling, are not a convincing foe.  So far they have won every battle the same way - by lack of resistance.  With half the galaxy gone, one would think the New Republic would begin to fight back.  And with the same small band of heroes fighting back each time, the series is becoming a little repeative.<br />But despite this, Balance Point is perhaps the best book to date in the New Jedi Order series.  Tyers is an innovative Star Wars writer, and should be asked to contribute again.  <br />A Post Script: On the subject of Danni Quee, I am glad she has been absent from the past three books.  I felt her character was good in Vector Prime, but her training to become a Jedi in Dark Tide irked me.  She is a valuable resource intelligence wise, but don't we have enough Jedi?<br />Until next time...	2000-12-27

After being approached by an old friend, he learns that an old smuggling friend is working for the murderous invading Yuzzhan Vong, and heads off to seek revenge.  But along his travels, he suddenly finds himself the only one who can save the Jedi from an Vong assassin - and he doesn't even know it!

After the rousing and thrill-packed Hero's Trail, I would have expected more.  In this lackluster follow up (in which nothing really happens,) the evil Vong and the Hutts strike a deal, and Leia goes to the Harpes Empire for help.  At the same time, a Jedi allows himself to be captured and tortured, and Anakin and Jacen fall out over Jacen's unwillingness to help defend the galaxy from the most vile creations to enter it.  Unfortunately, the most interesting thing that happens here is the plight of the refugees, which are actually quite compelling, as the rest is pretictable and boring, although one has to wonder whose side Jacen is really on.  Pity, because Luceno is the most promising of the writers brought into the New Jedi Order storyline.  But unfortunately, he is not the real problem, which affects the entire storyline.  The Yuzzhan Vong are too powerful, too shallow an enemy, and five books later one would think that New Republic should have one some battles by now.  The following books should have them losing some major battles or else this series will run out of steam.	2000-12-07

I am a huge fan of Primal Fear, and its superior follow up Show of Evil.  And because of that track record, I grabbed Reign in Hell as soon as it hit the selves.   <br />Unfortunately, with a major change in tone and plot, Reign is a giant  disappointment.  Gone is the intense cat-and-mouse game that made Show so  brilliant, nor the strong, unforgettable characters of Primal.  Instead, we  get a movie-of-the-week plot involving redneck militias with fantasies of  armogeddon, with Martin Vail and Aaron Stampler thrown in for what seems to  be the hell of it.  These two characters do not fit into such a  none-personal story, and their involvement is so convoluted that it makes  almost every other event in the books seem unbelievable too.  <br />But alas,  too much legal speak and dumb-plot syndrome predominate the book, boring  the first time reader and angering those who had read his works before.   And that is a pity.  Veil and Stampler were too of the most memorable  characters to ever face each other.  The way their story is resolved here  makes the climax an anti-climax.	2000-05-15

His friends never resurface.  And so begins Extinct, which will probably before ever known as the 90's other giant shark book, getting  nowhere near the publicity (or blasting) of Steven Alten's Meg.  But unlike  Meg, this book takes it's plot seriously, and despite the name, revealling  the Megalodon's presence is a big spoiler, as when the marauding shark is  first discovered, it is mistaken for a normal great white.  As for  characters, well, I'm sure Wilson read a lot of Peter Benchley before  writing this, because most would be right at home on the pages of Beast,  Jaws or Creature.  There is drama and action, with some mystery added, and  in the end it is entertaining.  But the twist in the end, while  jaw-dropping storywise, is highly unlikely reality wise, which is not such  a good idea for a novel whose main draw is it not as comicbook as Meg.

But in the case of Ticktock, there is just no excuse.  Now I should be positive, but what positive things can I say about a book whose only likable character is a dog?  Or that the best thing about  the ending is that it is finally over?  Now that said, Koontz has said this  was his first and only attempt at a screwball comedy.  Problem 1: it's not  funny.  Problem 2: it's two serious to not be taken seriously (unless you  count the ending, in which credability, sense and style jump in front of a  speeding truck in a desperate attempt to outrun the author.)  The hero is a  idiotic jerk, his love interest is suppose to be kooky, but is just stupid  and annoying (not to mention trigger happy,) and the unstoppable monster is  pathetic, as is the resolvement of the piece.

By the next morning, I had finished, and was a  little confused.  Did I like it?  I honestly can't answer that.  All my  favorite characters were back (especially the lanky reporter Bill  Smithback, who was sadly ommited from the filmed version of the original  book,) and the plot once again took z-grade monster movie plot and made it  respectable.  It had some things that surprised me, and also had some  social commentary.  But again, my feeling at the end were vague.   Admittedly, the book was hectic, with Smithback seperated from the main  group for most of it, and the ending was so frantic that I had to read some  it twice (an oddity for me - I'm the sort of person who can watch the most  surreal movie and get it first time round.)

The Lost World is one of the most moronic pieces of trash to ever escape out onto the open market.  It  features badly writen, unlikable characters getting chased by dinosaurs on  an island that's name must translate to &quot;Plot Device.&quot;  The very  dead Ian Malcolm returns to allow Jeff Goldblum to star in the movie  version,and contributes nothing to the story other than more boring Chaos  thoery.  Okay, at least he's consistant.  After all anyone who actually  read the original (no classic but at least better than this,) was not about  cloning dinosaurs but Chaos theroy.

I re-read it twice a year and have done so  since 1990.  I guess thats kind of pathetic, but this novel, a tale about  killers, monsters, love and acceptence, is my favorite.  I guess I felt the  desire to write about this because of my current hobbie (I'm writing a  role-playing game based on the story, with more Barker worlds and monsters  thrown in for good measure.)

It has it's moments, with giggles through out, but it moves with no sense of pace, and ends so abruptly that  readers are left with the notion that they're being conned into reading the  second book.  The characters come and go with only three being truly  memorable.  Two are the lead characters - the cowardly wizard Rincewind and  the niave tourist.  Both are interesting and well drawn.  The third is  Death, who shows up and tries to periodically convince Rincewind to die.   These three make up for the uninteresting supports who crop up, make bad  puns, and then thankfully die in amusing ways.  Terry tries to inject black  humor, but the setting is just too cutesy for the murder and mayhem that he  likes to throw in.  But at least he tries hard (too hard one might be  tempted to say,) and that is why he gets 3 stars.	2000-05-03

This gripping thriller is both thoughtful and chilling, as a small group of concentration camp survives  are picked off one by one by the title character, a Jew who hunted other  Jews for the Nazis in WW2.  Only two cops stand in his way, one white and  retired, the other young and black.  Together they must solve the mystery,  before there is no-one left to say, and the killer disappears into the  shadows once more.  As usual, Katzenbach's vivid descriptions of Miami add  flavor to the mix, and this deep look at a dark chapter in Jewish history  makes the novel even more compulsive.  An original winner.	2000-04-04
US	50270834	R366OSZZE3IGGJ	0345384555	287618918	Thor	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Enthralling tale of duty and love	When I first read this novel, I had rented from the library because I had nothing else to read.  I was expecting a silly, possibly fun read (not the author's fault, but the publishers - the cover makes it seem like a cheap  horror flick.)  I was suprised to find I was wrong.  Thor is a exciting and  rewarding story that is at times thought provoking, funny, and sad.  Thor  and his relationship with &quot;The Pack&quot; is deep and moving, as is  his torn emotions when he descovers the secret of Uncle Ted.  Though the  werewolf subplot is a bit hokey, it also provides the novel with the right  conflict for drama to flower.  An undiscovered gem, right up there with the  James Herbert classic, Fluke.  Perhaps even better.	2000-04-03
US	50270834	R17XPFN4ACXAT6	1575664305	36141406	The Trench	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Meg sequel a fun but nasty little thriller	I love sharks.  I will do any thing I can to get close to them, be it aquarium, movie or doco, or, this case, a book.  Now while I abhor the demonizing of sharks, I can also forgive it in the form of entertainment.   I know what sharks are really like, and so can inwardly smile while  watching Jaws or Deep Blue Sea, or reading novels such as Extinct, Jaws,  and the forementioned Meg.  For me, Meg was a fun, dum thrill ride, and in  many was, so is The Trench, except for two small differences - 1.) this has  spy plot involving a Lex Luthor type villian (hey - he's rich, he's bald,  and is insane, so it sounds a dead-ringer to me!), complete with thoroghly  evil henchwoman, and 2.) this story is meaner, nastier that the preview,  which while it had it's bodycount, the original Meg ate mostly jerks.  In  this, many innocents get in the way, somehow avoiding warnings that a 72  foot great white shark has escaped and is prowling the oceans.  Still, as  with the first, the action setups are thrilling and visual - again hinting  to wards film treatment, and he does his best to expand the characters he's  created.  I look forward to book three, as proposed on the Meg website, but  Alten may want to spread his wings a little more before readers tire of  &quot;Jurassic Shark!&quot;	2000-03-03
US	50270834	R1MX29CVDZSGR	0553577328	339443172	War (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 3)	Books	3	17	18	N	N	A disappointment	After years of bemoaning David Bischoff's awful AVP: Hunter's Planet, I was delighted to find that the thrid novel in the series would be written by a Perry once again.  But unfortunately, as I turned the last page, I had  to admit, after such a long wait, I felt cheated. While she handled her  three marine character well - especially Ellis, the comtech turned  cyberdemon - Ms. Perry was forced into the trap Dark Horse comics had set  for her.  She portrayed the Predators as evil.  No code of honor, no only  killing those who are armed.  Just slaughter.  And while having Machiko  sympathize with the alien Queen was interesting, her ignorance on the  hunting ways of the Preds seemed farfetched, coupled with a thread-bare  plot and too many annoying, one-scene characters.  Now I don't want people  not to read this novel, because it is entertaining up to a point and has is  far superior to the previous novel (which this book merrily contridicts  left, right, and centre!)  But Ms. Perry had done much better.  Hopefully,  next time, she'll get to write the novel we want to see, with all of the BS  Dark Horse currently produces nothing more that a memory.  Until next time,  I guess.	2000-02-06
US	50270834	R2A9AU2H2Q6FPE	0553578820	8971344	Tales from the New Republic: Star Wars Legends	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Good little collection	I like short stories.  I like Star Wars shorties.  I did not particular like Tales From Jabba's Palace, but I did the others.  And I really like half of this collection.  Now what I don't like.  Chris Cassidy and Tish  Pahl have created two annoying characters who unfortunately get two stories  in this collection.  Neither are worth much, except as space fillers.  Too  many stories concern Dark Jedi, and yet another forgotten Jedi MAster that  Vader somehow missed.  But despite this their are some gems.  The short  novel by Zahn and Stackpole, the amusing Boba Fett tale written by an  author with a wink and a smile.  A treasure hunt/romance, and some  wonderful conversations between two prisoners.  These stories make the  collection worth while, and provide interesting expansions of the universe.   What needs to be put out though, is a collection of their best stories,  exorcising the works of mediocore authors like Cassidy and Pahl and  celebrating those whose works amaze and delight us, without ever previously  hearing their names.	2000-02-06

I've mostly enjoyed the X-Wing series, but mostly the Stackpole novels, due to Allston's tendacy to overly convolute his plots and characters, and his awful sense of humor.  And while the  painful jokes are still featured, gone is the absude plotting and  characters.  Enter, a very different X-Wing story in which Wedge and Co.  must play off against the Empire in order to convince a world of warriors  to side with the New Republic, but as Wedge learns more about the culture,  he begins to believe that they are not the sort of people the Republic  wants.  Better characters this time round (though I did miss Allston's  &quot;Face&quot; character,) and a plot that, for the first half at least,  is centered on morality rather than dogfighting.  Better plots like this,  and Allston will up there with Zahn, Stackpole and Perry as the great  &quot;Star Wars&quot; authors.	2000-01-13
US	50270834	R2VOK2PHRNZ1QK	0061058254	166934037	The Crow: Quoth the Crow	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not perfect...	A long time ago,I wrote a rather unfavorable review of author Bischoff's Alien novels.  Mister Bischoff took the time to respond to my comments, and I was impressed to find an author who at least reads what his readers have  to say.  Given that, when I managed to pick up a copy of Quoth the Crow, I  decided to give it a fair chance, not letting either of his Aliens books  bias me.  And I must admit, while slow paced, while not perfect ... I liked  it.  Now I have just come off a old horror kick, re-reading many classics  by Poe, Lovecraft, Stoker and the like, so it was nice to see so many  references to them.  Also, many of my friends exist in the Goth subculture  discribed in the books (where similar clothing, listen to same music, read  Sandman...), which was an extra hoot.  And the story is surprisingly solid,  with a likable central figue in the form of William Blessing.  One odd note  though, while a good author, the constant mentioning of Dean Knootz  distracted me, as he is not a Gothic fantasy/horror writer, though mentions  of my own favourite author (Clive Barker,) sort of dispelled this  distraction for me.  And Mister Bischoff, if you are still out there, let  me know what you think.	2000-01-13

While Clive breaks away from his usual horror and fantasy world, he also merges them into this sweeping tale that his half soap-opera and half Biblical epic, as two powerful families verge  together for a showdown that, alas, will not take place until Book Two.   But still, this book pulled me in and kept me there, as I lived with the  characters, breathed with the characters, as I do with most of Barker's  works.  And while this is a comedown from his brilliant  &quot;Scarament,&quot; it is still a gripping, entralling journey of  wonderment.  Before going, I will recount a small story about when I  brought this book.  A friend of mine read the cover blurb of &quot;Epic,  Erotic, Fantastic,&quot; and laughed.  A passerby stopped and commented,  &quot;Clive Barker, right?&quot;  When she affirmed this, the stranger  nodded and said, &quot;They're right.&quot;	2000-01-13
