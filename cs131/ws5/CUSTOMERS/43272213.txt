Books	5	15	17	N	N	A Killer (And Others) Exposed	The main body of this story is a fresh look at the (previously) unsolved 1975 murder of fifteen-year-old Martha Moxley in the Belle Haven neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut, and the disastrous and failed investigation and aftermath of the crime. It's a tragic story about murder and the privileges of wealth and power.  At the head and tail of the story are a pair of sequences that give retired detective Mark Fuhrman's examination of this cold case a larger perspective.<br />After recounting the basic facts of the case, Fuhrman explains how he became interested in the Moxley murder (through author Dominick Dunne and an explosive leaked document), and the hostility and obstruction he met in Greenwich, from police and residents, when he arrived there to begin his research.  At the end of his story he hands an incredibly scathing indictment to Greenwich's police department and civic leaders and the residents of Belle Haven.<br />This isn't mere payback, either.  By the time he delivers his kick to their collective pants he's spent the better part of four hundred pages bending them over with well-researched facts and intelligence, and by shining a harsh light on their character and actions.  He even demonstrates that the Greenwich Police Department failed to learn from the mistakes of the Moxley debacle and repeated all of these mistakes in a homicide investigation several years later.<br />In examining the failures of a police department and the community that should have supported it, Fuhrman offers these stirring words:  &quot;Corruption comes in many forms.  Sometimes it is a payoff. Other times it is simply fear, laziness, selfishness.  Everybody has his reasons for not solving the Moxley case, or not helping those who could have.  There are always reasons not to do something, and cowards will turn these reasons into excuses.  One of the worst forms of cowardice is silence.&quot;<br />Fuhrman identifies his suspect and lays out his case.  A month after this book was published (there's a new afterword by Fuhrman) the wheels finally began to turn in Connecticut, leading to the conviction of Martha Moxley's killer a quarter of a century after the last blow was landed.<br />A great read, but much more than simply that.  Well done, Mr. Fuhrman, and may all of the Moxleys- especially Martha- finally find peace.was published (there's a new afterword by Fuhrman) the wheels finally began to turn in Connecticut, leading to the conviction of Martha Moxley's killer a quarter of a century after the last blow was landed.<br />A great read, but much more than simply that.

In fact, it combines the contents of two earlier books (&quot;The Life And Times Of The Shmoo&quot; and &quot;The Return Of The Shmoo&quot;) which were published in paperback in those years.<br />Needless to say, Al Capp's brilliance shines through in every panel of these stories from the peak of his remarkable career, and the Shmoos remain the most lovable of his many memorable creations (which also included Fearless Fosdick, Sadie Hawkins Day, Lower Slobbovia, the Scraggs, Bet-a-Million Bashby, the Kigmies, Wolf Gal, and Evil-Eye Fleegle, whose double-whammy entered the language).<br />This material is found in its complete context in volumes 14 and 25 of Kitchen Sink Press' complete reprinting of &quot;Li'l Abner&quot;, which made it to volume 27.  In fact, the jacket art and Harlan Ellison's introduction are cribbed from volume 14.  Size and clarity of reproduction are about the same in either.  This book will be a must for completists (like me), a pleasant rediscovery for the nostalgist,  and an absolute joy for the uninitiated.	2004-06-29

It just seems like entertainment (and it's certainly that) until he gets you where he's going- and you won't see it coming, either.  Without ever being high-handed or obvious, Suggs finds profundity and Biblical wisdom in the most human of events- from a Lego project with his son to the horrors of Driver's Ed- and presents them in a way that's sure to stick with you.  You don't have to be a believer to find the eleven nuggets here meaningful, but it sure doesn't hurt.<br />A perfect gift for anyone who likes to laugh.	2004-05-17

It has plenty of those, and in complete form, so you can use them, but the emphasis is on excellent graphic design and how distinctive, intelligently-used fonts feature in it.  This is made vivid with lots of illustration (much of it in color) and lots of text, which is informative, insightful, and very analytical.  This is an essential reference and educational tool: students should consider it a small investment, and I can't imagine a professional designer being without it around the office.<br />The emphasis is rightly placed on early to mid-twentieth century design, but the book is fairly comprehensive, with enough of the Victorian Era and the Digital Age to justify its subtitle.<br />The book itself is a nicely-bound softcover with thick pages and good, clear reproduction.	2004-05-12

My rating, which will anger some, is an average of two things: five stars for Charles Schulz' classic work, and one star for the presentation.  &quot;Peanuts&quot; is an American masterpiece, and at long last we have the earliest stuff here, in the dawn of its development, with real graphic beauty, a groundbreaking and highly influential look, and just a hint of the eccentric individuality that would impact popular culture so much in the sixties.  And the rest is on the way!<br />It's just a shame that since we had to wait so long for this great, essential material they couldn't get it right, and this nice-looking little hardcover misses on at least two counts.<br />I know the argument about &quot;Peanuts&quot; having been designed to be printed small, but that's a spurious, specious, and convenient justification for the tiny presentation here.  Exhibit A: Schulz himself did not approve of the shrinking of the comics and said so often; can anyone really believe he would rather have his classic drawings seen and his lettering read at this size than in the more generous space afforded his colleagues, including Walt Kelly (&quot;Pogo&quot;) and Al Capp (&quot;Li'l Abner&quot;) in recent reprint series? Exhibit B: I can't swear to this, but it's a good bet that these strips are actually printed SMALLER here than they were in 1950!  If not, it's probably pretty close.  At any rate, there's always only one reason the comics are printed this small, and it's the same this time: it's cheaper.<br />The other blunder is both aesthetic and economic:  the Sundays should have gotten separate volumes, and IN COLOR.  Those books would have sold very well, the absence of the black and white Sundays would not have hurt sales of the dailies volumes any more than the size-blunder will, and the Sundays do not need to be read in continuity.  As a matter of fact, they will interrupt the flow of the stories in later volumes.<br />Will I buy all of these books anyway?  Of course, and without hesitation. At this size, it's kind of like being able to take the library microfilm home, and they're in hardcover, and they have nice (though decidedly un-Schulz-like) cover designs.  And it's great that this wonderful, indispensable, historic material from a great genius of the comics page is finally available, much of it here for the first time in more than fifty years.  But that's why it deserved to be done exactly right.<br />Buy it, because you have to.out hesitation.

In other words, nobody gets punched in the jaw or uses bad grammar.<br />Revolving around a setting- the theatre- and a prop- a top hat- that symbolize Ellery Queen's place in time very well, this one takes a little while to get going, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. I'm going to take advice from the reader from Kansas (below) and give these guys (uncredited authors Dannay and Lee) another chance with a later entry in the series.<br />If you can possibly lay hands on Otto Penzler's beautiful facsimile of the first edition, by all means do so.	2004-05-05

Arnette Heidcamp- an extraordinary woman who seems to be a more than competent gardener and at least an amateur ornithologist- uses the engaging and entertaining story of these two baby eastern bluebirds, which she rescued from a nearby nesting facility, as the framework for a concise but comprehensive look at bluebirds in North America.  In the first part of the book, Heidcamp examines the three types of bluebirds (eastern, western, and mountain), describing their eating, breeding, and migrating habits, and the challenges they've faced as their population declined at one point to near-extinction.  She also details the rescue efforts that have met with considerable success since the 1950s, identifying some of those responsible for this laudable effort. The charming story of Bonnie and Ben follows, and this will provide the main enjoyment for most readers.  The two baby birds had been abandoned before their lucky meeting with the devoted and kind-hearted author of &quot;Hummingbird In My House&quot; (another excellent story, well worth your time), and their interlude as guests in the famous sunroom provide us with another valuable reading experience.<br />An appendix offers helpful information to those interested in attracting bluebirds and maintaining bluebird houses.<br />I anxiously await her forthcoming book &quot;Andy Rooney In My House&quot;, in which she nurtures the famous televison commentator and returns him to the wild.	2004-04-08

Ukridge (pronounced &quot;ook-ridge&quot;), moocher of socks, shirts, and fivers, evader of creditors, bane of rich aunts, is another of Wodehouse's many great comic creations. Perhaps the best of these are about his management of soft-hearted fighter Wilberforce &quot;Battling&quot; Billson, but the stories are uniformly excellent and hilarious; full of unpredictable comic twists and the brilliant language and dialogue that make Wodehouse a full-fledged genius.<br />On the first page of the first story Ukridge offers Corocoran the rights to his life story for a hundred pounds down (quickly reduced to twenty-five).  Corcoran, who foolishly lets the opportunity slip, may have lacked the big, broad, flexible outlook in this one instance, but P.G. certainly didn't.<br />The well-crafted, nice-looking edition is another winner in Everyman's excellent serires.	2004-03-01

The action and the energy level are the equal of any writer in the genre, and for pure readability he's one of the most entertaining.  But there is clearly some valid literary intent here as well, and as a result bookstores have never been quite sure where to place the few novels he wrote about Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones.<br />Himes' background as a black ex-convict (and eventual expatriate) add to his interesting perspective as he tries to capture- or, more accurately, caricature- the violence and the \\"comic chaos\\" (his phrase) of the Harlem Renaissance.  Coffin Ed and Gravedigger are two ruthless detectives caught between their own people and the white law that employs them; they really don't fit into any group other than themselves.  They are outsiders who believe strongly in order and in the guns they carry, but are often conflicted, and occasionally even divided.<br />This is probably the best and the tightest of Himes' stories with these characters; it is a fabulous read and one I will return to often over the years.  The world Himes conjures is savage and disturbing, and the characters are eccentric to the point of being circus freaks, but are always believable and compelling.  This is the kind of book that will leave you trying to describe scenes to your friends.<br />Coffin Ed and Gravedigger may be the greatest individual creations of a very rich genre.  I'd say start here.	2003-09-29

This fairly short book provides a concise history of the campaign from Dalton to Atlanta, but at heart it is really more of an essay, arguing several points and re-examining things that have been too easily accepted.<br />McMurry reconsiders the military performances of Johnston, Hood, Sherman, and Grant, with no one faring particularly well in his review.  He also re-examines Grant's overall strategy for 1864, the political and personal complications of Confederate President Jefferson Davis' working relationships with the armies in the fields, the ruinous personal politics of the Army of Tennessee, the effect of the Atlanta campaign on the 1864 presidential campaign, and the question of whether Nathan Bedford Forrest and his Critter Company could really have destroyed the Union rail lines by riding east from Mississippi.  His examinations of these matters and many highly hypothetical issues are unusually lucid, well-conceived, and logical, and he argues his points so well it's hard to disagree.<br />The details of the campaign itself are, as always, difficult to follow with total understanding; the geography is challenging even to a local native.  The book really excels in providing a broader historical context for the events it describes.	2003-09-27

There are hundreds of beautiful images here, most in color, all very well-reproduced and on thick, high-quality pages.  The images are well-chosen and are all striking in color and design, and are a great inspiration to the designer and a visual treat for the casual art-lover or pop culture enthusiast. Advertising and political and poster art were in a golden age during this period.  The fairly sparse commentary is intelligent and provides context for the work documented here.	2003-09-27

It was also one of the funniest things ever to appear in the funny pages.  Fosdick, a skinny, hatchet-jawed detective who is frequently riddled with enormous bullet holes (hence the title of this book), is the ideal of Abner Yokum and every red-blooded American boy, and stars in their favorite comic strip, within the \\"Abner\\" strip itself. Fosdick endures a world of corruption and his seventeen-year engagement to the beastly Prudence Pimpleton in order to slaughter members of the criminal underword for twenty-two-fifty a week.<br />This handsome paperback from Capp's faithful re-publisher Denis Kitchen picks up where an earlier volume left off, collecting a handful of Fosdick stories (and one about Fosdick's fictional creator, Lester Gooch) from the late fifties and early sixties, as well as a few of Fosdick's \\"Wildroot Cream Oil\\" ads from the period.  Dave Shreiner's commentary is, as always, insightful and intelligent.	2003-09-27

It was every bit as lurid as advertised, but is generally a very close cousin to Raymond Chandler's Marlowe novels in character and tone, though the plotting is much less convoluted and we don't get quite as entangled with secondary characters or setting.  Spillane emphasizes Mike Hammer's incredible toughness and verility on every page, with all the usual gumshoe vernacular, and as with the best detective novels, character counts more than crime.  That's a polite way of saying I figured this one out pretty early, despite trying hard not to, and it didn't diminish the reading experience at all.<br />Spillane has the last laugh on his critics- this is good stuff.	2003-09-27

This book, one of his four classic how-tos of drawing, has already been a gift to artists everywhere for generations, and is a priceless resource of knowledge and information.  Along with Hultgren's similar book, this is the classic workbook on the subject.<br />Hamm stresses a solid approach to the construction and anatomy of animals, but also helps the reader grasp the conceptual aspects of how animals are put together and what similarities and differences are important to comprehend.  The book is very thorough in grouping animals into basic families, such as big cats, monkeys, elephants, etc., and the organization of the book is a major plus.  Hamm is sharply focused on construction, solidity, and three-dimensional views of animals and how they move.  A college art course could be taught from this book.<br />Hamm's greatest admirers have always been his peers- fellow artists will tell you that this is the right aproach to drawing animals, and this book will remain in print and in use forever.	2003-09-26

Ward, Norm Saunders, and Enoch Bolles, among many others.  To the best of my knowledge there's no other great source of their work in print (especially Bolles), but they're very well served here, and very little of the work seen here is reprinted elsewhere.  The text is diligent, thorough, well-written, and interesting, covering the rise and fall of the magazine niche-industry that produced these amazing visual works; it is scholarly and will be of great interest and service to students of the subject, but the broader appeal- pun intended- is in the more than four hundred color images.  These are beautifully reproduced at a generous size, and on slick, high quality pages.  The overall design of the book is also excellent.<br />I'd like to see another volume, perhaps including some of the interior art, if it's worth seeing.

This beautiful series of books is a Godsend from revered publisher Denis Kitchen, and reestablishes Capp's important place as a twentieth century artist and writer.<br />My favorite sequence here has Abner posing as a college student (\\"Oh,Happy Collidge Days!!\\") as a couple of equally-disguised gangsters try to kill him.

In fact, it's a very good novel.  Monahan takes the basic facts (or claims) that we have and fleshes them out artfully, with a narrator, dialogue, and a point of view that work beautifully well.  The gripping story takes the horror and suspense genres in a unique direction, and lives up to the incredible source material.  A small complaint: he tries to wrap things in a too-neat 1990s package for us at the end- the only false note he strikes here.<br />The book left me very interested in this case, and my interest increased recently when I discovered close family ties to many of the people depicted here, including Elias and Sugg Fort.	2003-02-14

Spiegelman's somewhat sparse text is full of useful information and valid critique, but he wisely lets the material speak for itself, and that's the main attraction here, though those words and the book's design seem to have distracted some readers.  This is not an anthology of \\"Plastic Man\\"- that can be found elsewhere, fortunately- nor is it an in-depth biography of Jack Cole.  It's more like a large catalogue for an exhibition, covering all aspects of his varied career.  Material seems to be reproduced from original art in a few cases- mainly his Playboy stuff- but the comic book stories are shot from original issues, with four-color separation and page-yellowing quite evident- and speaking as a sometimes-comic artist, that's close to the way I think they should be seen (I HATE modern re-coloring, and especially airbrushes!).

The early newspaper version of Superman may have been superior to the contemporary comic book version- there is an excellent, very funny lookalike story in which Superman trades places with an even meeker and milder Clark Kent type for a day and makes trouble for various bullies.<br />The presentation here gets an A plus, with extra material, informative commentary, and another beautiful cover (and interior) design by the ever-excellent Peter Poplaski. This book, as well as the Sundays volume, perfectly compliments a similar treatment afforded to the \\"Batman\\" dailies and Sundays of the same period. Marvel should go this route with the early \\"Spider-Man\\" strips by Stan Lee and John Romita.	2003-02-13

The restrained and intelligent color palette is perhaps the most striking feature of his work; his use of shapes is even more mathematical than a collection of patterns would imply. It's a useful and inspiring resource for designers and afficianados, and the material richly deserves to be preserved and presented.	2003-02-11

Mucha was a fascinating man and an artist of considerable magnitude, and as the title claims, his work is the spirit of Art Nouveau, though no such label should limit the amazing body of achievment found here.  I haven't collected other books of his work yet, but surely this volume will remain definitive for some time.	2003-02-11

The research is meticulous and the information he presents on the film and the people who made it make this book a winner- just like his companion study of &quot;All About Eve&quot;.  Some of the complaints here, though, are the same as with that very worthy book.  Stagg gives at least equal weight to the film's afterlife, particularly the lightly-regarded Broadway version, as to the mega-classic 1950 Wilder film. And once again, the tiresome emphasis on certain obsessions- camp, divas, catfights, and cross-dressing- not that there's anything wrong with that- do tend to distract from the work as straightforward film history, at least for those of us less titillated by those aspects of the film's following.  And finally, Staggs attacks Billy Wilder- the greatest filmmaker of all, in my opinion- with a preposterous theory that Wilder's work after ending his collaboration with Charles Brackett (including &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, &quot;Sabrina&quot;, &quot;Witness For the Prosecution&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, and &quot;The Apartment&quot;) doesn't hold up!<br />What makes this book a must-own anyway is the great information about the film itself- the art-directors, musicians, actors and actresses, designers, and shooting locations, as well as the behind-the-scenes look at Paramount in its heyday.  The interview with Nancy Olson is a particular highlight. And if you're into camp, divas, and catfights, change that rating to five stars.	2003-02-09

The work here is rich and appealing, as in all the books of the series, and if you're a designer, you'll find it very inspiring as well, and a handy reference tool.<br />The book itself is a fairly small paperback, though very nicely printed on glossy paper.  The work inside this and other volumes in the series certainly justifies a larger, hardcover treatment.	2003-02-03

All of the artists here are deserving of recognition, though only a handful of them are truly well-known and adequately documented in print elsewhere. All of the many artists here are well-represented; the reproduction is flawless, and the commentary is intelligent and well-researched.  The original edition is my point of reference here, so I can't vouch for this one fully, but it appears to have maintained the integrity of the earlier printing and is a very handsome production as well.	2003-02-03

Shore	This is a pleasant collection of travel-related visual bric-a-brac, mostly from the teens, twenties, and thirties, presented without much comment or context.  The material speaks for itself, and is worthy of collection, but a few better-focused volumes would serve this subject matter better.	2003-02-02

This is a terrific collection of the guy who invented this type of stuff.  Flip through these pages and you can't deny that the man draws and paints like no other, no matter how many others draw and paint like him.  The glimpses of his early comic work (especially as Al Capp's assistant) are always a treat. The selections from Frazetta's career as a fantasy artist are intelligently chosen and are presented in a meaningful context, and the terrific layout of the book makes it especially pleasant to experience.  There are gorillas, dinosaurs, vampires, and female curves aplenty here in Frazetta's matchless palette. Sketches by Frazetta, included throughout, are particularly impressive and add to his already rich credentials as a pure draftsman.  The commentary is great. Best of all, this too-brief volume is only one in a very welcome series.	2003-02-02

His intelligent blend of the caricaturist's eye and the designer's sense of the beauty in flat forms add up to an entirely unique contribution to twentieth century popular culture- and a highly influential one.  His recent passing at age 99 marks the end of the century that he witnessed and commented upon so wittily and so stylishly.  His legions of admirers (and imitators) will be well served by this 1999 book, assembled by the artist himself, with an excellent selection from his career, his invaluable commentary, and a fairly satisying selection of his amazing (and less celebrated) color work.  The reproductions are fine here, and the volume is designed and presented well. It can only be hoped that more comprehensive releases and reissues of earlier books are in the near future.	2003-02-02

Cornwell, revered by his peers and his generation, had fallen into an entirely undeserved obscurity in recent years, but the work here emphatically places him in the front ranks of his profession.  Looking through these pages, it's hard not to feel that the commercial artists of Cornwell's time easily surpassed the fine artists.  Certainly, it's hard to imagine how someone who could draw and paint this way would be received today.<br />This attractive book is a thorough and comprehensive collection of color work, studies, and sketches, all with commentary and excellent reproduction.	2003-02-02

This is an excellent entry in the terrific Heller/Fili series on Deco graphics, but it isn't strictly a book of fonts.  Like the other books (&quot;German Modern&quot;, &quot;French Modern&quot;, &quot;British Modern&quot;, &quot;Italian Art Deco&quot;), it is a collection of striking graphic images from the period, this time with an emphasis on characteristic lettering styles.  Relatively few of the fonts are shown in a complete and therefore usable form, so this book is more of an inspiration and a reference tool than a directly applicable source of type.  But it's an inspiration for sure, and has been very helpful to me in my work, and it's also simply a visual pleasure.	2003-02-02

I was most interested in artists like Les Clark and Johnny Lounsbery, who have received less attention than some of the others. Canemaker not only brings them vividly to life with meticulous research, but he also manages to bring new information and fresh insight to all nine of his fascinating subjects.  No matter how well you thought you knew the Nine Old Men and their work, there's plenty here for you.  This book reveals the lives and personalities of these men, analyzes their contributions extraordinarily well, and also their working and personal relationships with each other, and presents great new visual material from their lives in and away from the studio.  The Kimball stuff is a special treat.<br />Who could have imagined that Marc Davis' early life was as interesting as his work?  Or that Kimball and Kahl were even crazier than you thought (and even more brilliant)?  Ot that the master, Frank Thomas, actually struggled with his draftsmanship? Canemaker captures the promise of each of these men's pre-Disney careers and the spark in the work that caught Walt's attention is always evident.  He also captures the human quirks that played a tremendous role in the golden age of the studio and often found its way onto the screen as well.<br />Much of this information and all of Canemaker's excellent insight would not have come to light without his diligent effort and research, and the result is a well-written, revealing, tasteful, and very visual masterpiece.<br />PS We lost the great, one-and-only Ward Kimball recently...only Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas are still with us now. God bless you both.	2003-01-12

The book is handsome and well-designed, and of the subject herself no more needs to be said.  Probably the best visual book on Audrey so far, by a slight margin over &quot;Audrey Style&quot;, which is more informative.	2002-07-14

The humor is so dry you're not sure if it's really there.  This one never quite catches fire, but it's never quite draggin', either (hee, hee).  It's wittily written and entertaining enough, and boy, did they do dustjackets right in those days!  Thanks again to Otto Penzler for a beautiful edition in this series of facsimile-firsts, which richly deserves to be continued.	2002-07-13

Author Burnett gives us an entertaining peek at a presumably typical rise-and-fall in the Chicago underworld of the early twentieth century, long before this type of material was well-mined by others. As usual, we are indebted to Otto Penzler for a beautiful edition; the jacket art is a deco masterpiece.	2002-07-12

Fans of the golden age Disney films and animation in general are very familiar with the brilliant career of color genius Mary Blair, one of the most important graphic and commercial artists of the century, and some of her best work is found right here between these covers.  These beautiful illustrations are among the warmest and most engaging she ever did.  \\"I Can Fly\\" is one of the very earliest (and best) Golden Books, and this miniature edition seems to be complete, unlike the more common modern reprints which are severely truncated.  The color reproduction isn't a hundred percent accurate, either, but unless you want to spend considerable time at the swap meets or on eBay, this is your best bet. For more about Mary Blair (as well as Golden Books hall of famer Gustav Tenggren and many others) see John Canemaker's excellent book \\"Before The Animation Begins\\".  Oh, yeah, and if you're a real little kid you'll find it much easier reading than this slightly pompous review.	2002-07-11

He was an artist's artist, still instantly admired by anyone who picks up the pencil, and his simple approaches to the problems of draftsmanship, while infinitely helpful to us mortals, do nothing to hide the fact that he was a master of several forms. I'm particularly grateful that he covered this subject- landscapes, perspective, etc.- the bane of so many cartoonists and animators. As a basic reference this book offers something every time you open it, and deserves to remain in print and in use forever.	2002-07-10

In an age when comics are all about layers upon layers of muscles drawn by people with no basic command of simple anatomy or proportion; in an age where comics are all about melodramatic, showy over-staging and over-the-top page layouts, and characters with no personalities; in an age where comics are basically dead, this book deserves a quick peek.	2002-07-10

It's certainly a fun read, but it's the introduction of the Charlie Chan character that gives it a special place in the history of the genre.  Chan is certainly an appealing and engaging character, and it's easy to see how such a successful franchise followed.  Biggers also makes excellent use of his tropical setting, which along with Chan's presence, makes the reading experience memorable.<br />As usual, the edition itself is beautiful and a great pleasure to own; many thanks to Otto Penzler for more time and money well spent.	2002-07-10

Answer: you reduce the game descriptions to the following formula: Date of game, attendance, weather, records of the two teams, list of opponents beaten, list of opponents lost to or tied, a brief synopsis of scoring drives with a few players' names mentioned, cite the turnovers, and give the final score. Repeat a hundred and six times and then publish. Illustrate these chapters with small black and white photographs of the two teams playing (for the most part) other games on their schedule: here's a picture from '76 Tech-USC; here's one from the '76 Georgia-Vanderbilt game (WHY?). Offer no insights, don't quote players or coaches or fans, just the facts.  Griffin barely even mentions the wildly controversial call that decided the 1999 game, a call that got national media attention and resulted in the crew being disciplined! And the huge brawl during the 1993 game, which was front-page news the next day, gets no mention at all. What a disappointment: the author, whose lack of ties to (or interest in) either school is pretty apparent, simply read library microfilm and phoned in this lifeless attempt at a Father's Day gift. And may I add in closing that Tech lies and cheats?	2002-06-02

It also contains one of the most powerful single chapters I've ever read- a set piece in which a mysterious woman stalks a bartender simply by staring at him and following him until his nerves begin to crumble- which could stand alone as a short story superior to the novel as a whole. As a reading experience, this is a genuine treat, and the book itself- a faithful facsimile of the first edition- is beautiful to look at and a great pleasure to own. A bargain at the original price and a steal on sale. Thank you again, Otto Penzler.	2002-03-25
