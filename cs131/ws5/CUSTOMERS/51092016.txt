And, honestly, when's the last time there was a quick and interesting read about economics?<br /><br />The book could use both more length and depth, but hopefully that will come in the form of a sequel.<br /><br />Recommended for those looking for a fun and interesting quickie read. Not so recommended for those hoping this is a profound work that will somehow change their life.	2005-10-10

In many ways, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is the end of the first half of his saga. This is the conclusion of Harry as an innocent and a young man. No surprises here: The entire series has been leading towards Harry having a final confrontation with Voldemort.<br /><br />The certainty of that confrontation, and the uncertainty of what will result, hangs heavily over \\"The Half-Blood Prince.\\" Harry's sixth school year is full of preparations for the confrontation. The wizarding world is on high alert, the Death Eaters are murdering those who will not side with them, Harry's rival Draco Malfoy is up to something and Headmaster Dumbledore is preparing Harry with the information he'll need to face Voldemort in the prophesized final battle.<br /><br />An air of tragedy and tension thus overlay the normal interests of 16 year olds, including the opposite sex, sports and the opposite sex. Romance fully blossoms at Hogwarts at last, but it's love during wartime, given less time to bloom than it would in more peaceful times.<br /><br />In many ways, this is J. K. Rowling's \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\": There are no real conclusions here -- even the much-hyped death is so wrapped up in mystery that it will inevitably be the focus of much of the final novel -- but merely setting things up for that final conclusion. And as it's always darkest before the dawn, Rowling makes things very, very dark indeed. Any notion that she would be dumbing down this story, or the depiction of evil, for a children's audience is finally ground to dust. Death and other evils are treated in a mature fashion, especially the ramifications for the survivors.<br /><br />Along the way is a great deal of evidence that Rowling has grown up as a writer along with Harry. The structure of the early books is almost entirely gone, and all indications are that the final book will have only a passing resemblance to previous books in terms of structure. Quidditch is here, but it receives its smallest focus to date. Time spent in class is likewise not the focus of the novel, nor is a great deal of time spent with Harry's non-wizarding relatives, the Dursleys. At this point, Rowling rightly assumes anyone reading her novel is aware of the setting and history, and just jumps right into the story itself.<br /><br />But this is ultimately a hard novel to judge, as it really forms the first half of the final novel of the series. Indeed, it looks likely that the first chapter of that book will take place hours, at most, after the final page of \\"The Half-Blood Prince.\\" It's going to be a heck of a ride, with confrontations with numerous antagonists likely to be going down in surprising ways, if the twists in this novel are any indication.<br /><br />On its own, this isn't the best novel in the series -- that's still \\"Prisoner of Azkhaban,\\" for my money -- but it's definitely among the best installments to date.<br /><br />Now to climb the walls for two more years waiting for the conclusion of this series ...lest focus to date.

In contrast, \\"Red Thunder\\" is a popcorn movie, all concerned with fun and momentum forward.<br /><br />Literally a novel about four friends who help assemble a homemade spaceship in an attempt to be the first people on Mars -- with the help of a disgraced ex-astronaut and his idiot savant cousin -- \\"Red Thunder\\" is a love letter to the Robert Heinlein \\"juvenile\\" novels about people pulling themselves up by the bootstraps of their moon boots and heading out into space for adventure.<br /><br />And \\"Red Thunder\\" succeeds at that, handily, in fact. His physics, once you get over the giant deus ex machina at the heart of the revolutionary space drive, are pretty good. His realpolitik is excellent, and a bit more canny than Heinlein. And, for once, Varley doesn't emulate Heinlein at the end of his life, meaning this is his first novel in decades without strong (and often somewhat strange) sexual content.<br /><br />This is a fun-for-all-ages, no deep thinking necessary adventure novel. Judged on its own merits, it's a definite success. Judged as part of the Varley canon, it feels like something he just knocked out for fun between bigger projects. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his next big project, whatever it might be.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for space adventure fans of all ages, especially readers of earlier Robert Heinlein novels.	2005-08-09

That Pratchett keeps this in mind, and indeed, makes his salvation just as important as saving the world, is a credit to his skills as a writer and heart as a person.<br /><br />The eighth son of an eighth son is a wizard. And the eighth son of a normally celibate wizard is a sourcerer, a living font of magical energies. But it's slightly more complicated than that: a father with a grudge against the magical establishment, a magical establishment (the cast of Unseen University, alternately pathetic and for once frightening) that's hungry for power, and a chain of events that quickly gets out of control all hurtle this story towards disaster.<br /><br />Along the way, we get introduced to the daughter of the greatest hero in Discworld's history, who just desperately wants to be a hairdresser but finds that some things are just in her blood. We also pick up a very unlikely barbarian hero and a literary minded monarch and his fabulous pleasuredome. And, of course, the magic-less wizard Rincewind and his animate Luggage make a triumphant (well, as triumphant as Rincewind gets) return.<br /><br />\\"Sourcery\\" is Pratchett's most heartfelt novel to date, and he puts the characters ahead of plot or jokes -- although there are plenty, especially concerning Conina and Unseen University -- and it makes for one of the best Discworld novels to date.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.	2005-07-29

The mix of fantasy, humor, war novel, social commentary (especially regarding the place of women in society), tying it in to the larger overarching storylines that have developed in the Discworld novels and creating a new setting and mostly brand new cast should have been a mess.<br /><br />It shouldn't have worked, but it did.<br /><br />Borogravia is a small isolated backwater of a nation, with its only natural resources apparently being an infinitely deep well of hostility for its neighbors, flavored with the worship of a pugnacious (and increasingly strange) god and the cult of personality surrounding a ruler who has not been seen in decades and who never produced an heir.<br /><br />And like all nations that can least afford a war, Borogravia is endlessly involved in them, typically as the aggressor. The nation is being steadily depopulated of men with all their limbs. Finally, Polly Perks has decided she's had enough -- her slow-witted brother has been taken off to war, and she has no idea whether he's alive or dead, and she's determined to find him and bring him back to the family inn. So Polly cuts her hair, disguises herself as a man (simple in a country where all women wear skirts or dresses, especially for a girl with a somewhat boyish figure) and joins the military.<br /><br />Of course, it's never quite that simple. This is war, after all, and a war that Borogravia has not just lost, but is apparently about to lose decisively, once and for all. Fortunatelly, Borogravians are both ignorant and pugnacious, and fighting for their horrible little country, because it's THEIR horrible little country is what comes naturally. Despite overwhelming odds, including a massive coalition of foreign governments sick to the back teeth of the little country, Polly's unit -- which hides more secrets than just hers -- blunders its way into history, fame and the possibility of transforming Borogravia forever.<br /><br />In addition to telling a gripping adventure story of Polly's unit roaming the wasteland that was once Borogravia, pursued by a very angry prince and his crack troops, and heading towards an impregnable castle that they have no chance to break into, let alone take, Pratchett is also making a very real examination of military life (one decidedly slanted in favor of the enlisted units, in Pratchett's typical populist style) and, more  importantly, what it means to be a woman in society and in the military. This is a lot for a little novel to be packed with, and it doesn't always work -- the Vietnam movie jokes that are tossed in are only mildly cute and probably should have been cut -- and there's probably too many interesting characters in her unit -- as neat as trolls, Igors and the Discworld vampires are, we don't need them in this novel, and certainly not both of them.<br /><br />But overall, the book works, and works well, as an adventure novel, a military novel and even a novel that, in its own way, is an examination of modern female roles. In a lot of ways, its ambition helps elevate it -- instead of just being a romp through the streets of Ankh-Morporkh (as fun as those may be), \\"Monstrous Regiment\\" is elevated to the level of \\"Small Gods\\" (with which it shares a bit of cosmology) and other \\"deeper\\" Discworld novels.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for Discworld fans, and generally recommended for readers of military fantasy novels, including \\"The Black Company\\" and \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\" It's surprising how much of a commentary \\"Monstrous Regiment\\" appears to be of those darker, more \\"adult\\" novels at times.ition to telling a gripping adventure story of Polly's unit roaming the wasteland that was once Borogravia, pursued by a very angry prince and his crack troops, and heading towards an impregnable castle that they have no chance to break into, let alone take, Pratchett is also making a very real examination of military life (one decidedly slanted in favor of the enlisted units, in Pratchett's typical populist style) and, more  importantly, what it means to be a woman in society and in the military.

While that is an imprecise high concept version of \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\\" it embraces the two most important aspects of the book would-be readers need to reconcile themselves with. If you are uncomfortable with magic -- not magic realism, not imagined magic, but actual magic done by the characters -- the book is not for you. Likewise, if the notion of reading nearly 800 pages written by Susanna Clarke channeling Jane Austen sounds hard to bear, wait for the movie.<br /><br />But for those who find either of those bearable -- or, better yet, an exciting prospect -- \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is a strange and wonderful novel that you will live in for longer than you expect and shorter than you will end up wishing.<br /><br />One of the first truly adult fantasy novels -- which is to say, it emphasizes real emotions, subtle and conflicting motivations and genuine love over special effects, gore and sex -- Clarke's novel is full of characters who can be both repellent, attractive and pitiable, sometimes all in the space of one paragraph. The novel, even if one has given into temptation and read too many detailed reviews, is full of surprises, both of the large plot twist sort and or the small character moments sort. The ending, in particular, is a bittersweet wrench, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the novel, and yet slightly surprising and heartbreaking despite that.<br /><br />With the love between Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the scholarly passions of Mr. Norrell and a host of \\"theoretical magicians,\\" the strange and eventually fascinating Childermass, the various cloying toadies, the sweet and in-over-their-head Greysteels, Clarke creates more delicately detailed and compelling characters than most novelists manage in a whole series of novels. And it is as much the love between Jonathan and Arabella that drives this novel as it is the love of magic of the two protagonists. But there is magic a-plenty, including spectacular magic wrought on the battlefield against Napoleon, whom one feels almost sorry for as Strange gets more and more comfortable in his role as Wellington's magician.<br /><br />But the plot is longer and more complex than that, and Napoleon is mostly a stepping stone for the magicians in their quest to return English magic to its rightful place, and their real enemy is subtle and devious, and more than a little insane. Their enemy is one of the most interesting antagonists in fiction, and Clarke successful makes him a mythic sort of villain. At the same time, she also manages to create a great deal of mystery around the ancient Raven King, creating a mystique around a totally made-up character that has the weight of real world myth and legend.<br /><br />Despite the novel's historical period and many ties to real world history, it's not necessary to know anything about the British fighting Napoleon, the poetry and life of Lord Byron or anything else of the sort. Clarke provides more than enough to understand and enjoy the setting, although the more one knows about history, the more Clarke's very low-key winks at it are revealed -- Byron's and the Shelleys' legendary Swiss vacation that, in many ways, gave birth to the modern horror genre gets a dismissive reference from Strange at one point, who obviously does not yet know the historical significance of the house on the lake and those who stayed there, for instance.<br /><br />I normally whip through a novel this size, particularly if I love it, as I did this one, in a weekend, or a week at most. Instead, I found myself putting the book down and not wanting to go further, wanting to savor and digest the book in small doses. Now that I've finished it, I only have a small short story by Clarke (on the official novel Web site) left to me of it.<br /><br />If the initial description -- Harry Potter as written by Jane Austen -- sounds good to you, don't hesitate. The sooner you enter the 19th century England of Strange and Norrell, the happier you'll be. This is easily one of the best novels, of any genre or literary merit, I've ever read.e sooner you enter the 19th century England of Strange and Norrell, the happier you'll be.

That is, of course, until a crime with distinctly magical -- albeit sinister -- elements threatens to reawaken his long-buried memories of an adventure across two worlds when he was 12 years old to save the life of his mother.<br />In some ways, \\"Black House\\" is a significant departure from \\"The Talisman\\" -- the novel is both more grounded in our world and more of a horror novel than its predecessor -- but the last half, and especially the last third of the novel makes it clear that this is absolutely a fantasy novel, and one tied in to King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series. Jack Sawyer and the events of \\"Black House\\" overlap with the events of that series -- the mission of Roland the Gunslinger figures prominently in the background -- but does not intersect with them. The battle Jack wages for French Landing, while having ramifications for fans of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, is its own story, which is good news for those not interested in King's other fantasy series.<br />But like \\"The Talisman,\\" \\"Black House\\" is, in large part, about consequences. The evil facing French Landing -- at least, the evil those fighting to save the town are first aware of -- is not a new one, in any sense of the word, and its history is part of what makes it so frightening. Jack spends the first part of the novel, like the reluctant Western heroes his movie star mother used to co-star with, denying his past and his current responsibilities. (The gunslinger references, both as a thematic element and an overt reference to the star of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, come fast and furious as the novel barrels towards its conclusion.) And, indeed, consequences for things that happened in the past, things swept under the rug, triumphs whose victims have not yet had their say, and evils the community never wanted to look at too closely, are what drive the story, all the way up to its dark surprise ending.<br />If it is thematically similar to \\"The Talisman,\\" the novel is more interesting stylistically: The narration is by a strange hybrid of first and second person, with the authors explicitly moving with the reader through scenes, talking about what \\"we\\" see. It's an interesting change from \\"The Talisman,\\" which had only one use of the first person in the narration. While initially distracting, this choice gives the impression that King and Straub are reading the story to the reader, which echoes action within the novel, wherein Jack has regular sessions reading to a blind friend. It's an idiosyncratic, even somewhat odd choice, but it works.<br />The end of the novel sets the reader up for further adventures of Jack Sawyer. Whether they'll be part of the story begun with \\"The Talisman\\" or inserted into the final volumes of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series is something that perhaps only King and Straub know. But as harrowing as those final pages may be, you know that those further adventures can't come soon enough.<br />Strongly recommended for fans of \\"The Talisman,\\" \\"The Dark Tower\\" or any dark fantasy works.

US	51092016	R163W6NULU7KRZ	0345444884	122553244	The Talisman	Books	4	8	10	N	N	The Talisman: A Fantasy America Fever Dream	In 1981, Stephen King and Peter Straub teamed up to create the first \\"dark fantasy\\" novel, two horror novelists' take on a classic adventure story of a child moving from the mundane real world to a larger-than-life fantasy world right next door, for the sake of a quest critical to the survival of each world.<br />While the form is an old one, aside from Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" and L. Frank Baum's Oz novels, the genre is traditionally almost entirely British or European: Alice in Wonderland or through the looking glass, the British children entering Narnia through the wardrobe and painting and so on. More importantly, the actual consequences of such adventures are rarely dwelt upon to any degree: Twain's story is a comedy, Alice wakes up into the real world at the end of her adventures, and if the children forming a new Royal Family in Narnia has an repercussions, they aren't felt on this side of the wardrobe.<br />In contrast, the repercussions of the adventures that take place before the opening of \\"The Talisman\\" - the adventures of the parents of the protagonists, to be specific - are what drives the action. The sins of the fathers become the problems of the sons, problems far beyond what any child should have to endure. That the adults could get so entranced with the magic of the Territories that they become drunk on it is part of the dark underside of fantasy, one rarely touched upon prior to the publication of \\"The Talisman.\\"<br />But while the fathers find the magical land of the Territories - a magical pseudo-medieval American colonies that never were, where an old blues player serves as the wise advisor instead of a white-bearded wizard - to be intoxicating and seductive, their children also see the terrifying side. Monsters even worse than those that exist in the real world - and the horror grounding of authors King and Straub clearly communicate an understanding of real-world evil - stalk back and forth between worlds, and young Jack Sawyer has to dodge shapechangers and carnivorous trees along with pedophiles as he hitchhikes across America and the Territories.<br />The influence of Mark Twain's stories of child adventurers abroad - Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, of course - is strongly felt here, from the on-again, off-again presence of a strong adult black male in a world full of racism, to the unabashed adoration of a closely observed small town America, to the sly sideways look at American follies, both personal and public. (After this book, Jack Sawyer even grows up to become a detective, much as Tom Sawyer does in Twain's fiction.)<br />But if the form is classic fantasy, and the content in the vein of Mark Twain, the style is distinctly modern horror, as one might expect from King and Straub. Events that might be magical in the hands of other writers - voices coming from small funnels in the sand, talking animals, animated trees - takes on a hallucinatory, runaway feel, like the reader is falling down a well, or riding a roller coaster no longer under the control of the operator. While the adventure may have begun, in part, with self-determination on the part of 12-year-old Jack Sawyer to save the life of his cancer-ridden mother, he soon is in over his head, sucked relentlessly from one danger to another, both mundane and magical. The violence and danger he faces are conveyed with a visceral reality, enough to make the reader flinch and wince in sympathetic pain.<br />Countless dark fantasy writers have further explored the realms charted out by King and Straub in the years since, and both fantasy and horror novels have had their mutual boundaries smudged since - there are even romance novels that operate in this sort of milieu now - but to read \\"The Talisman\\" is to go back to the spring from whence the stream first began to flow. And like Jack Sawyer finds whenever he \\"flips\\" over to the Territories, all the flavors and scents are stronger here, of \\"such purity and sweetness that you might imagine a man could smell a radish pulled out of the ground a mile away.\\"<br />Strongly recommended to anyone who ever loved a fantasy adventure tale, even if - or perhaps especially if - you long ago put aside such childhood things.ness that you might imagine a man could smell a radish pulled out of the ground a mile away.\\"<br />Strongly recommended to anyone who ever loved a fantasy adventure tale, even if - or perhaps especially if - you long ago put aside such childhood things.	2004-02-20
US	51092016	RK8FZYAMHCKPE	097010488X	224970565	Freeport: The City of Adventure (d20 System)	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Freeport: A Schizophrenic Pirate Setting	&quot;Freeport: City of Adventure&quot; is a sourcebook for setting Dungeons and Dragons games in Freeport, a former pirate city now turned a rough-and-tumble port city trying (most of the time) to go legit.<br />Published in a hardcover format by Green Ronin, &quot;Freeport: City of Adventure&quot; is an attractive and well-designed book. While not as content-dense as, say, Wizard of the Coast's various Forgotten Realms sourcebooks - the difference in type size and white space is striking - the overall high quality and narrow focus of &quot;Freeport&quot; still makes this an excellent value for those interested in pirate and nautical adventures.<br />The book features a good timeline for Freeport and the region - in theory, it can be dropped into any large maritime trade lane in any setting, and it works best when placed in such a context - that is carefully generic enough to be able to fit into most settings with a minimum of fuss. (There need to be multiple competing political powers and shipping routes, which most settings have. The only setting I can think of off the top of my head that would have difficulty fitting in Freeport would be a Dragonlance campaign, although I suspect it could be done. Setting Freeport in the Iron Kingdoms - which works well in a number of ways - would require tweaking the religions found in the city as well as some of the races, but neither would be an insurmountable obstacle.)<br />This is followed by extensive information about the city, quarter by quarter. For the most part, the book focuses on highlights from each area, but sufficient information is given for each quarter that most Dungeon Masters will feel very comfortable setting action there, while still leaving enough room for their own creations, or additions from other books. (There are subsequent books in the Freeport line that do just this, and the setting also works extremely well with Citybook II: Port of Call from Flying Buffalo.)<br />Finally, there are new rules, including prestige classes, a new NPC class, a host of pirate-flavored spells (one tattooing a treasure map on the back of the subject, and then wiping their memory of where the map actually depicts is a particular winner) and some modest gunpowder rules. Some adventure seeds are also provided.<br />One thing potential buyers should be aware of is the somewhat schizophrenic tone of the book. For one thing, Chris Pramas and the other contributors are squarely in the camp of putting in overtly humorous characters and situations in the book, as well as some slightly anachronistic material. Elements like a daily newspaper (well, news sheet) feature strongly in the setting. While not a big deal taken individually, it creates a rather different tone than in most D&amp;D settings, something some DMs might find jarring. The humor in the setting (including character names that are obvious allusions to popular media characters) is something many DMs will also want to scan for ahead of time and change as needed.<br />The issues of tone also apply to how &quot;bad&quot; Freeport really is. The hype on the back of the book, and in marketing hype in general, talks about how dangerous and deadly the city is. In reality, Freeport doesn't come off particularly more dangerous than any fantasy city - how criminal and corrupt is a town where drugs are outlawed? Compared to the TSR-licensed setting of Lankhmar, or Judges Guild's various city states, Freeport is Disneyland. Criminal activity in town is surprisingly mild and gang activity is more interesting than threatening. Still, it won't be too much work for a DM to crank the level of illegality up a few notches, but it's puzzling that it was set so low to begin with.<br />Finally, the book tries to have it both ways vis-&agrave;-vis gunpowder. While gunpowder is anathema to many D&amp;D games, it's also hard to picture pirates without flintlock pistols and cannons blazing. Modest gunpowder rules are supported in the back, as an option,but the rest of the setting bends over backwards to create magical alternatives to gunpowder, and mostly it's just awkward - the city is defended by enormous cannon-style wands that use unique rules, don't resemble any other magic in the D&amp;D game, and neither scratch the itch gunpowder-use pirate groups will want, nor fits seamlessly into standard gunpowder-free D&amp;D. Probably the best bet would be to use gunpowder but say that the materials used to create it only come from secret locations far at sea, and the cost of creating it is prohibitive on the mainland, even if someone knew how to do it.<br />Having said all that, Freeport has a charm and a freewheeling style that's hard to match and is a great contrast to the more generic D&amp;D published settings that groups were stuck with prior to the advent of the Open Game License. Where once groups had their choice of nearly identical-in-tone Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance settings, today players can find such wildly diverse top-drawer settings as Hollowfaust, Redhurst and Freeport. Freeport especially is supported with a line of supplements that expand and build off the setting, including the mega-module &quot;Black Sails over Freeport&quot; (which fleshes out the Pirate God, the one generic element in this work that should never have been left generic). It's a pirate's booty of riches, and Freeport is one of the brightest treasures.<br />Recommended for D&amp;D groups looking for a swashbuckling setting. Groups using the duelist prestige class or swashbuckler core class from &quot;The Complete Warrior&quot; will particularly find Freeport to be a good home base for their adventures.he rest of the setting bends over backwards to create magical alternatives to gunpowder, and mostly it's just awkward - the city is defended by enormous cannon-style wands that use unique rules, don't resemble any other magic in the D&amp;D game, and neither scratch the itch gunpowder-use pirate groups will want, nor fits seamlessly into standard gunpowder-free D&amp;D.

Frank Baum's Oz novels and have also always loved villain-centered stories, whether it was &quot;Grendel&quot; or the Flashman novels. So when I spotted &quot;Wicked&quot; in my local bookstore, it looked like this novel was written just for me. The map inside and the first few pages made it clear that, while author Gregory Maguire might be taking some liberties with what readers think they know about Oz, he was doing so within the context of the Oz lore that Baum set forth a century ago. In other words, this was to be an Oz novel for adults.<br />Unfortunately, that's not what was actually delivered. &quot;Wicked&quot; is an Oz novel, but it's a novel intended to impress people like John Updike and the &quot;New Yorker&quot; editors. It's one thing to have literary ambitions - frankly, too few American writers bother with writing works of substance or quality in this blockbuster-minded world - but it's another to sabotage your own storytelling for the sake of lending the appearance of extra literary weight to a novel already sufficiently weighty; it's gilding the lily, and slowing the novel needlessly.<br />The story of Elphaba and the (mostly) bloodless political and cultural revolutions Oz is going through leading up to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is one rich with ideas, social, political and religious. But first time novelist Maguire appears afraid to leave all this out in the open, in the milieu of a fantasy or children's novel. Instead, he approaches everything in a roundabout fashion, hinting at things, obscuring characters' intentions and behavior, and even making the main plot thread difficult to puzzle out at times. I don't dislike such things normally: Franz Kafka's &quot;The Castle,&quot; Henry James' &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; are all favorite stories, and all use the technique to stunning effect. But in those cases, the obfuscation was an integral part of the work, whether it be the (probable) madness of the latter two or the baffling and mysterious bureaucracy of the former. But here, Maguire's elliptical writing style is, with one exception, something thrust upon fairly straightforward events, not a natural consequence of them. (The single exception is a mysterious encounter at Shiz, the school where the future witches of the east, west and north are all students - their possible indoctrination as sleeper agents of someone attempting to manipulate the course of Ozian politics is creepy and effective, and the girls being put under a spell and/or hypnotized makes the vagueness of this passage work to great effect.)<br />This is all especially frustrating as Maguire's storytelling - when he gets out of his own way - is excellent, and the basic framework of the novel is currently the toast of Broadway, in the Grammy-nominated musical version of &quot;Wicked.&quot; While that production is arguably too dumbed-down (Elphaba wanting the Wizard to de-green her may work as a nice parallel to the characters in &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; but it strikes a discordant note for a character with steel for a backbone), it does point to the fact that the story works as a story quite well without needing the self-consciously literary flourishes with which Maguire gilds his story.<br />In many ways, it would have been nicer if &quot;Wicked&quot; were Maguire's second novel, not his first: The glimpses of brilliance that fans respond to in the novel might well have been unobscured if he was confident enough in his vision to not have tried to stack the deck and guaranteed the approval of sober-minded literary critics for someone daring to examine modern life through the lens of a classic children's story.<br />Recommended for adult fans of the Oz novels or movies willing to wade through a novel not as good as it ought to have been. Those who get discouraged with the sometimes glacial pace and obscure writing style are advised to pick up the &quot;Wicked&quot; musical soundtrack instead, which has full lyrics in the liner notes, and is also available from Amazon.he &quot;Wicked&quot; musical soundtrack instead, which has full lyrics in the liner notes, and is also available from Amazon.	2004-02-18

The briefcase with $5 million in cocaine money is still lodged in the tire well of an unsuspecting innocent driver, and a spree killer named Serge Storms is still chasing it.<br />Unlike the original novel, the sprawling cast of characters all quickly gravitate to a single location -- the unlikely crime novel setting of Tampa, Florida. Here Dorsey, a former journalist for the Tampa Tribune, mixes together criminals with aspirations, permanently pissed-off retirees, another radio shock jock (after having killed off his first one in &quot;Florida Roadkill&quot;), a Don Johnson imitator, a pair of Alabama Piggly Wiggly clerks on the run, a passive-aggressive private detective, an Earnest Hemmingway look a like and more.<br />The action is much more manic this time around, almost slapstick at times, with villains who are more comic than threatening. Although there are a number of deaths, most of them border on slapstick, and not always successfully. (Murder by taxidermy probably sounded more interesting than it actually turns out to be.) In a similar vein, Dorsey begins rolling out joke name after joke name, some of them fairly mild and obscure, others that are<br />true groaners.<br />On the other hand, the sense of place he evokes with Tampa is extremely well-done, and handled with a light touch, by focusing on a few key details rather than long essays on the character of the city, as previous generations of crime writers were wont to do. And Dorsey is extremely conscious of those who have come before, once again referencing other Florida crime writers both obliquely (a tourist reading Carl Hiaasen's novel &quot;Skin Tight&quot;) and overtly, with the climax of the story being punctuated<br />with clips from the Bogart/Bacall angsters-trapped-in-a-hurricane movie, &quot;Key Largo.&quot;<br />The title location, a seedy motel in a community turning into a standard Tampa retirement community, works especially well, with Dorsey describing the dingy rooms in clear (if somewhat off-putting) key details, and using the location to good effect, with natural reasons for the motley cast to all end up at the location by the end.<br />While somewhat hit and miss compared to his original novel or the works of Hiaasen, whose coattails his marketing has been designed to help him ride, &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot; is still a recommended read for fans of his first novel or the works of Hiaasen.retirement community, works especially well, with Dorsey describing the dingy rooms in clear (if somewhat off-putting) key details, and using the location to good effect, with natural reasons for the motley cast to all end up at the location by the end.<br />While somewhat hit and miss compared to his original novel or the works of Hiaasen, whose coattails his marketing has been designed to help him ride, &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot; is still a recommended read for fans of his first novel or the works of Hiaasen.	2004-02-13

The sequel, on the other hand, is grounded in neither, and reads more like Internet fan fiction or an entry in some sort of &quot;bad science fiction&quot; contest. When I read the paragraph where Hogan described the notebook of &quot;correct opinion&quot; the evil media elites distribute to newsrooms as part of the vast, sinister media conspiracy (literally), I had to re-read the paragraph several times, since I didn't want to believe something so comically stupid could have been written by someone who once seemed destined to be one of the great science fiction writers.<br />Nope, he did write it. And into the garbage went this book.<br />If you're looking for wonder and imagination set in Saturn's orbit, check out John Varley's Gaea trilogy instead, and stay well away from &quot;The Immortality Option.&quot;	2004-01-29

While the books share a certain structural similarity, the series is not about a boy going to a magical school to become a wizard. Instead, the series is about the second coming of the dark lord Voldemort, and the destiny of one boy -- Harry Potter -- to one day stop him, or die trying.<br />Nowhere is this more clear than in \\"The Order of the Phoenix,\\" the fifth book in the series and the darkest to date. Fresh on the heels of a death of a supporting character at the end of the fourth book, the heroes are circling the wagons, operating with a great deal of caution and suspicion as they wait to see what the newly risen Voldemort will do next.<br />But of course, life goes on, especially in a wizarding world where most members of the community refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned and, indeed, the unofficial government line is that Harry is crazy or lying in order to get attention. The presence of a powerful wizard at Hogwarts who believes Harry (headmaster Professor Dumbledore) means that the government intervenes even there, changing the character of the school in order to suppress panic, and as a result, give Voldemort's supporters, the Death Eaters, cover for their clandestine efforts.<br />As always, the series tackles more and more mature and complex issues in each subsequent volume. In \\"Order of the Phoenix,\\" Harry grapples with the fact that his idealized vision of what his parents were like is just a childish fantasy and, more importantly, that the battle he's been involved in almost since birth is marked by deep shades of gray.<br />\\"The world is not divided into good people and Death Eaters,\\" his god father, Sirius Black, tells Harry at one point. And so it is that Harry has to battle an antagonist (one of the most cruel and vivid in modern literature) who is bad without being evil, and not a friend while not being an actual enemy.<br />And all the while, Voldemort is waiting in the wings. How he's linked to Harry's mysterious visions and what he wants and why are the central mysteries in this volume, which is much closer to the kids-solving-a-mystery structure of the first three books than \\"Goblet of Fire\\" was, and the payoff is immense: Not only do readers finally get to see just why every other character in the series are so impressed with Voldemort and Dumbledore, but the lies and deceptions readers have noticed Harry being fed since the first series are (mostly) torn away at the end, exposing the frightening and tragic shape of things to come.<br />Because the tragedies are not done: It's war, and more beloved figures are going to die. Who, why and how are the questions, but the shadow of death looms over \\"The Order of the Phoenix,\\" and casts an ominous pall over future volumes. But like the bird for which the group is named, there is a hope at the center of the story, that perhaps, no matter how dark things get, that good will prevail and the light will be reborn, even from the darkness.<br />But darkness is still gathering, and readers who found \\"Goblet of Fire\\" too dark be warned: It's going to get a lot darker before the dawn.<br />Strongly recommended for Harry Potter fans, especially those enjoying the battle between good and evil at the heart of the series.an actual enemy.<br />And all the while, Voldemort is waiting in the wings.

In many ways, Grimes is more at home in this environment than he is in the modern day. We see him dealing with truly bad figures -- with and without badges -- as a future massacre and coup rush towards him at a headlong pace.<br />(Fans of &quot;Thief of Time&quot; will be glad to see the time-twisting Monks of History have a supporting role in this magical tale of time travel, but readers by no means need to have that read novel to enjoy the Sweeper in this book.)<br />The cameos (younger versions of established characters) in the book are natural and work well in the story, and fans of Nobby and Venitari should especially be pleased. The new characters, including Lord Winder's secret police, the Unmentionables, are all vividly drawn and feel like they've always been a part of Discworld.<br />While the novel has its share of laughs -- many of which spring from seeing the origins of established characters, and Vimes' perhaps unwitting nudging them towards their destinies -- it's also one of Pratchett's more serious works, with meditations on gun control, community policing and, as always, the role of the law and police officers in society.<br />&quot;Night Watch&quot; is best enjoyed by readers familiar with the other Ankh-Morpork stories, but is strongly recommended to any Discworld readers looking for a return to what is becoming fantasy's best-drawn cities. An unqualified success.the other Ankh-Morpork stories, but is strongly recommended to any Discworld readers looking for a return to what is becoming fantasy's best-drawn cities.

When I saw this book in my local bookstore, I felt compelled to pick it up.<br />The book is a compilation of recipes inspired by Discworld -- a wider variety than perhaps might be plausible, but bringing in the Ankh-Morpork city watch, wizards of Unseen University and other characters broadens this book's focus and appeal -- along with Nanny Ogg's advice on life and etiquette. The recipes are very British -- some of the ingredients are either unfamiliar to American audiences, or have names that will be unfamiliar -- but all look servicable enough.<br />The book shines in the sections later on, where Nanny expounds on life and love. While she keeps her infamously dirty mind relatively in check, the casual arrogance of the Lancre witches is good for quite a few laughs, with the not-so-subtle message that witches (and to a lesser extent, wizards) are above etiquette given that they can ruin the lives of anyone who would object. Not that they would, dearie. It's an amusing reminder that even the relatively benevolent Nanny is something of a terror to the mere mortals around her.<br />Ultimately, however, this is a small amount of new material for the price -- readers who thought &quot;Eric&quot; was a thin work will find this book to be positively anemic in comparison.<br />Recommended mostly for Pratchett fans who have read all his other works, and can't wait for his next novels to come out.	2003-11-12

The work is written with a devotion to detail, and the chilly fishing and farming nation is brought to vivid, even shiver-inducing life. The menace that faces the community -- a mysterious curse that strips residents of all morality and ability to relate to other humans, turning them into something worse than animals -- is both unique and genuinely horrifying.<br />However, Hobb is only half out of the previously mentioned trap: Characters in the series are either good people (if sometimes forced to do bad things for the sake of the greater good) or flat-out bad. It's a fairly simplistic characterization common to most fantasy novels of the last 10 years, and is all the more frustrating because Hobb seems to be capable of better. Likewise, the fairy dust approach to magic, including talking dogs (and apparently, in a related series, magical ships), is an unwelcome note of Disney into a series that is at its strongest when it is dark and uncompromising.<br />Finally, the series ends as so many fantasy novels do now -- incompletely. The mysteries that form the center of this work are not resolved here, and are set up for resolution in one of the later novels. Readers hoping for a complete-in-one-sitting story should look somewhere else.<br />Recommended for fantasy readers looking for something with a bit more teeth, but who aren't ready to jump into the deep end with Glen Cook's Black Company or George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. Mildly recommended to readers of Cook or Martin looking for something to tide them over while waiting for more from those two authors.readers of Cook or Martin looking for something to tide them over while waiting for more from those two authors.	2003-11-12

From there, we get serious repurcussions and goofy supporting characters (including a hooker who will only sleep with registered Republicans), all vintage Hiaasen fare.<br />While I've long been waiting for him to change up on his subject matter, like he did with &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; if only to recharge his creative batteries, &quot;Sick Puppy&quot; proves that even when staying in his traditional vein, Hiaasen can still write hits.<br />Recommended for Hiaasen readers who have already read &quot;Tourist Season,&quot; &quot;Native Tongue&quot; and &quot;Skin Tight,&quot; and Elmore Leonard readers.	2003-11-12

The following is a review by a long-time Hiaasen reader for other such readers considering picking up \\"Hoot\\":<br />Having read nearly all of Carl Hiaasen's adult novels (only excepting \\"Sick Puppy\\"), I was excited to receive a new Hiaasen novel for Christmas, his first children's book.<br />While it's definitely a Carl Hiaasen novel, he pulled some punches in the work that make it one of his lesser titles. It wasn't his strongly pro-environment stance (present and in a version that everyone can relate to, even adult readers who were ready for an example of Florida's problems that doesn't involve draining the Everglades, as serious of an issue as that is) nor his eye for detail (a hair on the lip of a middle school vice-principal ranks up there with one of the classic Hiaasen bits of all time), but his characters.<br />In every other Hiaasen novel, there is at least one hilariously odd character who helps break up the seriousness of the work by their misguided insanity, whether it's the hit man commiting murder for plastic surgery in \\"Skin Graft,\\" the hapless Hooters-besotted would-be white supremacists in \\"Lucky You\\" or any of the rock industry hangers-on in \\"Basket Case.\\"<br />While these characters traditionally help break up the sometimes instense stories, they're also one of the places where Hiaasen's manic sense of humor gets a chance to shine. Without it being present in \\"Hoot,\\" the book feels like the author (or maybe an editor) was holding him back. And as a result, the various non-kid characters seem somewhat depressingly pathetic. (Honestly, do we need more than two adults who are about to lose their jobs, when one of them is a perfectly nice individual who's just stuck in the middle of this chaos?)<br />Which isn't to say that \\"Hoot\\" isn't a good book -- it's a great one, one that pre-teens and up will enjoy (although there might be a few parents who take issue with the single swear word and Hiaasen's strongly anti-authority stance) and one that long time Hiaasen novels will find well worth picking up.<br />I especially look forward to Hiaasen's next work of fiction -- one could almost feel his creative juices being recharged by doing this somewhat different sort of novel. While his usual rogue environmentalist, Skink, has gotten very tired, he creates a kid-appropriate substitute in \\"Hoot,\\" and makes him the central focus of the story. I hope we'll see more of Mullet Fingers and the Eberhardts in his adult novels.<br />Recommended for Hiaasen fans and for readers 12 and up.Hiaasen novels will find well worth picking up.<br />I especially look forward to Hiaasen's next work of fiction -- one could almost feel his creative juices being recharged by doing this somewhat different sort of novel.

When Douglas Adams died, I had a chilling realization: My last hero was now dead.<br />It was an appalling realization for someone who, in middle school and high school, had been nigh-on obsessed with his work, having devoured all of it (including Neil Gaiman's companion book, years before he'd become famous in his own right), and even directed one of his radio scripts as a high school drama project. I found myself desperately wanting to listen to my old and long lost cassette tape of his radio shows (which are maddeningly not available at this time on CD), and to have one of my friends call me and say &quot;no, ha ha, it's not true, just a silly prank, he'll be around for decades more, don't worry.&quot;<br />But no. Instead, we get this posthumous collection of writings, of varying quality -- the much ballyhooed Procul Harum speech gives us scant information as to why Procul Harum is great and why Adams thought so -- but much of it an excellent insight into the mind of Douglas Adams. The Macintosh related works, in particular, are quite good, and I say this as I write on a Windows machine.<br />For Hitchhiker's fans, the book is a mixed bag. &quot;Young Zaphod Plays It Safe&quot; is republished with an ending that clarifies the somewhat subtle (and dated) joke. &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot; turns out to be a bit of Hitchhiker's ephemera as well (although its punchline only works if you've read the Hitchhiker's series) and then there's the work for which the book is named, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt.&quot;<br />It started off life as a Dirk Gently novel, and in a reprinted interview, Adams said it was likely to get reworked as a Hitchhiker's one instead. It's short, and while all the fragmentary versions have been combined together quite mercilessly -- the destination of a plane ticket changes repeatedly between versions on a sentence by sentence basis -- it doesn't add up to much. There is an interesting first chapter, some vaguely annoying Dirk Gently chapters after that, not much happens, and then, well, it's over. It looks as though Adams was going to riff on Los Angeles in this novel -- which, despite claims to the contrary in the story itself, he ended up knowing rather better than he might have liked -- but we'll never know. It certainly doesn't look like a Hitchhiker's book, beyond the DaveLand stuff in the first chapter.<br />But it's what we're left with, and it reaffirms what we already knew: Douglas Adams was quirky, funny, interested in technology, thought the self-importance of our species was deeply funny, was concerned with evolution and ecology and, ultimately, he was a really, really slow writer.<br />I will miss him deeply.<br />This is a book for confirmed Adams fans, but of no particular interest to more casual (or non-)readers.ly chapters after that, not much happens, and then, well, it's over.

So, taking all that as read, here is a quick review of the Collector's Edition.<br />Handsomely bound in red leather -- or a very good fake -- the book consolidates all three parts of the Lord of the Rings between two covers, along with the copious appendices at the end, and a map bound in to the back cover. The gold filigrees and designs on the book are intended to make the collection resemble the Red Book of Westmarch, at which it admirably succeeds: This FEELS like an interesting old book from a fantasy classic.<br />The volume has the heft and weight you'd expect, and opens easily: Even mid-way through The Two Towers, with hundreds of pages on either side, the book can lie flat for easy reading.<br />By necessity, the paper this volume is printed on is much thinner than that used for the Collector's Edition of the Hobbit, although I did not have any pages tear, despite sometimes unexpectedly hard use. Likewise, the spine did not hold up as well as that of The Hobbit, although since this book is far larger and heavier, some of that is to be expected.<br />The map at the back is bound in a little too well for my tastes, and it is difficult to read without running the risk of damaging it. Reprinting the map elsewhere in the book in addition to simply binding it in would have been preferable.<br />The slipcase is bound in the same red leather. While not likely to stop a bullet, it is well-built and should last for the lifetime of the book.<br />In short, an excellent book that will be an heirloom you will be proud to pass on to future generations of readers. A must own for any serious collector of fantasy fiction.	2002-07-23
US	51092016	R35BNSZM6EOFJY	006102063X	51458965	Moving Pictures	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A wonderful blending of parody and fantasy	Only Terry Pratchett would do a satire of Hollywood by incorporating it into a story about Nameless Things Man Was Not Meant To Know.<br />In this Discworld novel, Pratchett once again details -- or, rather, hints at -- the nameless horrors in the Dungeon Dimensions, home to things that destroy sanity and crave nothing more than to invade the universe that we (or rather, the characters in the novel) know. (And a big hello to the fans of H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulu mythos.) This time, their entry into reality is afforded through a mysterious little desert community called Holy Wood, where people are being drawn to create a new form of art (and business) heretofore unknown on Discworld: the moving pictures industry, commonly referred to as \\"clicks.\\"<br />What's happening and why only gradually becomes clear, but first we're treated to a send-up of classic Hollywood, one that eventually embraces dozens of classic films, as well as all the stereotypical Hollywood personalities. Returning characters include the wizards of Unseen University, shady peddler Cut My Own Throat Dibbler, the troll bouncer Detritus and, briefly, the City Watch of Ankh-Morporhk.<br />While movie fans will grin throughout at the \\"real\\" nature of the motion picture industry, including unexpected winks at different icons, the story overall has a certain menace and darkness not commonly found in Pratchett's Discworld novels, one which foreshadows his work with Neil Gaiman in \\"Good Omens.\\"<br />Strongly recommended to fans of Discworld, film buffs and fans of the dark creeping horrors of authors like H.P. Lovecraft.	2002-06-24

Even printed in a larger type face, it's slim on the bookshelf placed next to the rest of the series.<br />What that means is that Pratchett didn't provide this novel with multiple interwoven plots, there isn't the female friend/companion who turns into a love interest (a staple of his novels) and all of the action is very narrowly focused on failed wizard Rincewind's escape from the Dungeon Dimensions, where he was trapped at the end of &quot;Sourcery.&quot;<br />He gets out when Eric, Discworld's would-be Doctor Faustus, a spoiled brat turned amateur demonologist, summons a demon from Hell and gets ... well, him. Somehow, Rincewind has been gifted with the power to grant Eric's rather venal wishes. These take the duo (trailed by Rincewind's sentient and extremely dangerous Luggage) through time and space. Along the way, we get parodies of Aztec religion and Ponce de Leon, a particularly well-done riff on the Trojan War (superior in every way to the quicker one in &quot;Pyramids&quot;), visit the beginning and end of the universe and see what Hell is really like.<br />Without the need to slow down for a B-story, Pratchett moves through the story at a rapid clip, making this one of the best Rincewind tales to date, as well as tying up a loose end. (Pratchett has a bad habit of doing that with Rincewind; the first Discworld novel ended with him falling off the edge of the planet.)<br />Know that you're getting what amounts to a novella in a novel's packaging, but otherwise, &quot;Eric&quot; lives up to the high standards Pratchett has set with his previous works.<br />Recommended to fans of Discworld and Pratchett's collaboration with Neil Gaiman, &quot;Good Omens.&quot;	2002-06-06

While Pratchett is always funny, and a better plotter than I think many who have written him off as a \\"comedy\\" writer give him credit for, you'll need to really like the character of Death to fully enjoy \\"Mort.\\"<br />While he appears, albeit briefly, in almost every Discworld novel, the character is, pardon the expression, rather thin. The gags in this book are fairly self-evident, and repeated more than a few times. There isn't the sort of broad-ranging imagination Pratchett's friend Neil Gaiman brings to a similar character in his \\"Sandman\\" series, and so once, you've gotten past the basic setup, the story revolves around Death's young apprentice, the mystery of why Death would want an apprentice, and what happens when Things Start To Go Horribly Wrong.<br />Naturally, there's some nice magical chaos, romantic interest (isn't there always?) and a bit of last minute panic, as well as some broad comedy with the Four Horsemen of the Apocraplyse. Nothing phenomenal here, unless you're a big, big fan of Death. This novel also sets up \\"Reaper Man\\" and \\"Soul Music,\\" although it isn't required reading for either.<br />As always, Pratchett entertains, but this is one of his lesser works.	2002-05-21

Despite not featuring Unseen University or the witches of the Ramtop Mountains, this is my favorite Discworld book.<br />After hinting at it in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" Pratchett paints an engaging portrait of life in the Ankh-Morporkk Assassin's Guild. The suave, stylish, chic and, well, murderous life as an apprentice assassin is, against all logic, made sort of appealing and cool, like an academy for future James Bonds.<br />Then our protagonist, Teppic, is cruelly jerked back to his reality -- he's the son of the pharoah in the Kingdom of the Sun, and his father has just died. The cosmopolitan Teppic has to face what are, to him, backwards and outdated customs the rest of the world has left behind centuries ago. He's right, of course, and the mystery as to what's really happening in his kingdom spins out at Teppic tries to adapt himself to life as pharoah, and try to drag the kingdom into modern times.<br />Along the way, there is the ghost of his father, who mournfully watches his own body being prepared for the afterworld, a sassy handmaiden, and a mysterious and forbidding high priest. Toss in the greatest mathematician on Discworld -- not a biped, though -- a parody of Ancient Greece, and a graduate assassin turned pirate, and you've got a rollicking cast plunging towards a very local sort of doomsday.<br />The ending is a touch ambiguous for my tastes -- Pratchett was trying to use a light touch and went a touch TOO light for my tastes -- but overall, this is an engaging, amusing and even somewhat thoughtful Discworld novel, and one that stands alone even better than most.<br />By the order of the pharoah, this is strongly recommended.	2002-05-21

But his infant son has been delivered into the care of three witches, including the formidable Granny Weatherwax, who refuse to meddle in politics. Well, that's what they say, anyway ...<br />As a Shakespeare enthusiast, I found the parodies of both plays spot on and very fun -- elements of it hold up very favorably next to &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; -- and as a fan of fantasy novels, I was delighted to see how Pratchett handled the problem of needing (REALLY needing) to get a usurper off the throne with an heir to the throne who's not even potty trained.<br />A word of warning: The hamhanded marketing copy in the back pages of the book promoting the Discworld series gives away the end of this novel. I'm not sure what they were thinking there ...<br />Although I mostly prefer the Unseen University novels, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; is easily one of my favorite Discworld novels, and indeed, novels in general. Whole-heartedly recommended to fans of Discworld, Shakespeare or fantasy with a sense of humor.	2002-05-21

Finally, I decided to buy this handsome collector's edition, bound in green leather, slip-cased and containing JRRT's full color and two tone illustrations.<br />The high quality book -- the paper it's printed on is THICK -- and illustrations just add to the story, and make it easy to slip into the fantasy world he's created.<br />Not cheap, but definitely worth it for lovers of hobbits and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;	2001-12-19

I was surprised by the level of detail: There were facts about wizards that are only known to readers who go beyond the trilogy to the Silmarillion. Pretty impressive!<br />It should be noted that not everyone in the movie is in here: Gollum is notably absent, as his appearance in the film is being kept as a surprise for film-goers.<br />Definitely worth buying for anyone who enjoys the books or the movie.	2001-12-19

The Sorcerer's Companion is a brief encyclopedia to real world magic and myth used in the Harry Potter books.<br />The authors cover arithmancy, grindylows, witch hunts and much more in a style that's suitable for kids, but meaty enough for adults. I like to think I know a fair bit about such things, and I found myself learning quite a bit.<br />Hopefully, when JKR one day actually authorizes a book (maybe incorporating information about the people, places and things in the books), she'll give the Kronzeks a call.<br />This is a must buy for anyone wild about Harry.	2001-11-13

Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.<br />What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent....	2001-08-30

I don't feel ripped-off by having bought these -- any new JKR stuff while we wait on &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; is welcome -- but if the proceeds weren't going to charity, I would be a little less enthusiastic.<br />Both books are quite good, and I was surprised to find myself enjoying the Quidditch book more than I had expected to, as I'm not wildly enthusiastic about the attention lavished on the game in the books. (The book serves as a history of wizarding as well, and the anecdotes JKR includes bring the book to life.)<br />But these books are very, very thin, don't include all the material they're supposed to according to the novels and, well, they're not especially well-constructed. I would have been happy to get both books as a thicker flipbook if they could have had somewhat nicer cover cardstock.<br />But what you get is more JKR, a return to the world of Harry Potter, and something to keep the shakes while waiting for the next novel from getting too bad. Toss in the fact that the profits go to support a very good cause, and it's hard to have any real complaints!	2001-06-14

Second edition AD&amp;D (and previous) halflings are hobbits, and all the protestations in the world can't make that go away. There have been successful AD&amp;D and D&amp;D supplements about halflings, but they chose to ignore this fact and give richly detailed backgrounds that would fill in why halflings are how they are, without the looming presence of the Tolkein estate hovering in the background. Ed Greenwood did an especially nice job with the D&amp;D &quot;Five Shires&quot; Gazetteer, for instance.<br />Here, though, we get few new details, other than a reiteration of what we already know (halflings like community, food and comfort ... all of which we picked up in the first 10 pages of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;). Instead, there's a comprehensive gathering of halfling information from previous AD&amp;D sources. While there may well be campaigns that would like to import the kender from the Dragonlance world, some of the other inclusions are baffling: Wouldn't anyone who wants the cannibalistic halflings of Athas have bought &quot;Dark Sun,&quot; and not this book? Who needs the polar halflings?<br />What makes this more frustrating is that space is at a premium in this supplement, as the two least-popular races are forced to share the same space. So the pages wasted on polar halflings, Athas halflings and (arguably) the kender, could and should have been used for something, anything to round out the standard races that the consumer presumably purchased the book for.<br />If the halflings are too identified with their source, gnomes suffer the opposite problem. Most D&amp;D players asked to describe gnomes draw a blank, mumble something about illusions or Dragonlance tinker gnomes, and then change the subject. The simple fact is that most gamers (and D&amp;D authors) don't have the cultural grounding to use mythic gnomes in D&amp;D and gnomes were something of a blank slate until the Dragonlance novels were published, filling that blank slate with something new of Weis' and Hickman's invention.<br />For better or worse, the tinker gnome idea caught on, with even TSR allowing the idea to spread to other game worlds: A far better supplement than this is &quot;Top Ballista,&quot; for the OD&amp;D game, detailing the flying city of Serraine, built by the tinker gnomes' more successful cousins in the world of Mystara, the skygnomes. Today, hundreds of thousands of EverQuest players are familiar with the tinkering gnomes of Norrath, and the idea has appeared in other versions elsewhere.<br />Now, if there wasn't a desire to use the tinker gnome template more widely in this book -- although we already got Spelljammer, Dark Sun and planes-hopping references in this book, and sometimes in the mouths of the characters used in the game fiction -- surely the all but untapped origins of the gnome could have been explored. We would have also gotten a breath of fresh air in a D&amp;D cosmos that often smelled like Tolkein's musty old study, where little fresh air had entered in decades.<br />This isn't a horrible product -- and there were those in this line of Complete Books -- but it's also not very good. This is really only worth purchasing if you're a D&amp;D completist. If you're a fan of either of these races, you'll most likely be disappointed.

Whatever the state of your craft, it's where your ideas, your good bits, your passion all gets poured into. While I've enjoyed other Hiassen books more (notably &quot;Native Tongue&quot; and &quot;Skin Tight&quot;), this certainly seems to be true for &quot;Tourist Season.&quot; While all of his books have an overt current of rage directed at developers, destructive big business and endemic corruption, he always makes sure to leaven that with humor, a little zaniness, and some sweetness. Not here.<br />Sure, there's some amusing bits, a lot of them, really, but Hiassen's subsequent work has never been this dark, his rage never so undiminished. While all of his books barrel towards their climax, this is the first one I've read in which it's hard to see how there could be a happy ending, where the bad guys aren't REALLY bad and where it doesn't all seem like cosmic justice on the last page. I won't spoil the ending, but by midway through the book, it's clear that with the heaping handfuls of moral ambiguity mixed in, it's hard to have anything better than a bittersweet ending.<br />In a nutshell, Miami newspaper columnist Skip Wiley has had enough. Enough of the influx of Yankees to Florida and the concomitant woes of greed, development and reckless destruction of the environment. Especially the latter. When Skip Wiley goes missing, and a new terrorist organization, the Nights of December, starts targeting the tourist industry in South Florida (starting by shoving a rubber alligator down a man's throat and then putting his dead body inside his luggage), Skip's editor calls a former reporter turned private investigator to track him down.<br />Hiassen almost certainly does not advocate terrorism, murder and kidnap, but the cause is clearly near and dear to him, and he argues the Nights' cause eloquently. That makes their extremism tragic, and the possible endings all troubling.<br />A solid novel, and one of Hiassen's best. While all of his novels will make you laugh, and keep you turning the pages, anxious to see what the next twist in the roller-coaster ride will be, &quot;Tourist Season&quot; will make you think, too.<br />Definitely recommended for any of his existent fans, as well as fans of Dave Barry or Elmore Leonard.lumnist Skip Wiley has had enough.

Everquest is a BIG game and it's constantly being tweaked and updated. But this guide is extremely accurate, well-organized, and full of more useful information than any EQ Web site I've visited (and that's been plenty).<br />That's the biggest selling point for the book: It's nothing if not comprehensive. The guide includes:<br />* EQ Jargon dictionary -- Read it, otherwise entries on why &quot;training an NPC&quot; is bad will just be mystifying.<br />* The explanation of the &quot;play nice&quot; policies. -- Kill-stealing elves, and you know who you are, please read this already<br />* Information on what the in-game GMs can do<br />* Character naming policy -- The guy loudly outraged the other day that dirty rotten Verant made him change his name from &quot;Buttpick&quot; should have read this<br />* Commands<br />* Emotes -- And it also includes which are animated, since those are the best kind ...<br />* A list of Web sites sorted by category<br />* Information on how to creat a character, including what the abilities mean, racial tensions in the game and class modifiers<br />* More detail than most people will ever need on Norrath's pantheon of gods<br />* Several pages on each of the classes, including gameplay and roleplay suggestions, whether or not they're suitable for group or solo play and suggested races for each<br />* A similar write-up for each race, not sparing, say, humans; they're a bad gaming choice in most cases, sorry.<br />* Write-ups of the in-game skills, including information on trade skills (what sort of stuff a tailor can make, and what it requires, and comparable information for the other skills)<br />* A long section of general advice on the game, including how to make hot keys and macros, what server to choose (although this advice seems a little naive, as most people will dive right in when they install the game), group play, general tactics and etiquette<br />* A guide to Norrath, continent by continent, with accurate, but not super-detailed maps of the starting cities (so you can, say, find the bard's guild, but you won't know where to find an individual bard in the city without actually looking for him or her), a list of the various political factions in the game (aka Why Do Those Guys Keep Killing Me For Walking Down the Street?) and a general overview of what can be found on each continent. (Want to see unicorns? This will tell you where to look for them, and warn you that you probably won't make it back alive ...)<br />* A section on items in the game, although here it's a little politically correct about some elements of the game (bows and arrows are very, even unreasonably expensive in the game, making, say, elvish archers something of a rarity in my experience)<br />* An encyclopedia of several dozen creatures of Norrath. The information here isn't extremely detailed, but you can, at a glance, know whether or not you should bother hunting minotaurs when you start. (The answer, of course, is no.) This information isn't critical in the game, at last for people who've learned to hit the letter C when selecting a monster and thus sizing it up. Of course, a lot of new players don't seem to do that ...<br />* Finally, there's the spell listings, which include all the spells and bard songs in alphabetical order and more detailed information on the ones level 24 and under, including what category of spell it is, mana cost, estimated damage (if appropriate) and a very general description of effects.<br />All in all, a very solid tome of information, fat with useful information that players will find themselves using over and over again. (Just where IS that stupid bard's guild in Kelethin?)<br />I also applaud Prima for making it a non-spoiler guide. Starting cities are mapped, general information about the continents are given, and spells up to level 24 are fully detailed. Beyond that, information gets very sketchy (although all the spells in thegame at the time of publishing are included). And you know, that's good. EQ isn't a videogame to be solved. It's one to be experienced. And if you have a guide book open in your lap while playing, guiding you through it, you'll miss what's great about the game.<br />And a final note: I own a number of Prima guides, and this one has the best dollar-per-pages ratio of any of them. I suspect they could have gouged consumers at least $$ more without them noticing (I certainly wouldn't have), and I thank them for not sticking it to the poor EQ-addicted masses.game at the time of publishing are included).

US	51092016	R15UJIDSFSJ05B	0761527729	781066749	Majesty (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Extremely helpful, but ...	First off, this is the most-complete and most-helpful of the Prima guides that I've seen to date, and I'm a big fan of them generally, having gotten their guides for both Playstation and PC games.<br />This guide goes into extensive detail on how the game works, what each sort of hero, building, creature, spell and scenario entails, and even goes into the psychology of the game's artificial intelligence, so that you can accurately predict what each of the beings, good guys and otherwise, are going to do in the game. The guide also goes into great detail about each of the 19 scenarios of the game (and the free demo game available at their site, MajestyQuest.com), including offering at least one winning strategy for each.<br />Part of the reason it's so good is that it's written by Joe Minton, the head of Cyberlore Studios, the company that created &quot;Majesty.&quot; He fills in the backstory of the game, which actually hangs together very well and also foreshadows a lot of the events in the forthcoming Northern Expansion disk.<br />But Joe's participation is also the one small problem with the book: As someone who's lived with the game since it's inception and has had access since the beginning to all the things the cheat codes in the back of the book let a player do, he seems to lose track once in a while of how the game is supposed to be played: Several of his strategies for winning different scenarios discuss the use of banned units or buildings. That's marginally interesting advice, but for someone stuck on one of the scenarios, being told to build a temple that they can't use without cheating is less than helpful and sends the message that the scenario can't be beaten fairly, which I doubt was his intent.<br />Still, that's a small quibble. &quot;Majesty,&quot; the game, is a classic, and this Prima strategy guide is an invaluable companion piece.	2001-01-08

There's little romanticism here, and what little there is ends up being sneered at by the characters in the book. We also don't get a long build-up with a central character's journey from either bucolic bliss or mysterious origins as an orphan (both of which can be found in enough bad modern fantasy tales to turn anyone's stomach), but instead are thrust fairly quickly into the war between the evil goddess The Lady and the wizard-led rebel army in the north. In a way (and this is the only way &quot;The Black Company&quot; resembles the oft-repeated stylings of Tolkein), this is like reading a novel version of some of the notes from &quot;Unfinished Tales,&quot; wherein we see what the bad guys were doing during &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />Right. So, good ideas, no question.<br />Unfortunately, Cook works so hard to go against the grain of today's truly awful fantasy mainstream that he ends up throwing out the baby with the bathwater: &quot;The Black Company&quot; is terribly underwritten, on two fronts.<br />First, Cook eschews the naming style most fantasy novels feature, which can best be described as pounding a keyboard randomly and using what results as a name in the story. No clunky &quot;Drizzt&quot; or &quot;Belgarion&quot; here. Instead, members of the Black Company typically take on nicknames when they join the company, especially as many of them are hiding from their pasts and would like to have their real names die forgotten. Croaker, the company's doctor and &quot;annalist&quot; who records their history, is the narrator of the novel. And that's OK. Company members One Eye, Raven, Goblin, Silent, Elmo and the Captain all are memorable, as are the names of the Ring-Wraiths, er, Chosen, including Shapeshifter, Soulcatcher, the Limper and so on. Unfortunately, Cook doesn't know where to stop: the South has the warring factions of Red and Blue, there are the Jewel Cities of Beryl and Ruby, the Lady is fighting the Rebel, who are in turn led by the Twelve and their generals, including Whisper and Harden. It quickly goes from good idea to conceit to flat-out trite. Someone as clearly gifted as Cook should have realized when enough was enough and mixed in some other sorts of names at some point.<br />Less noticeably, but perhaps even more frustrating, is that the first person narrator (the aforementioned Croaker) doesn't share everything he knows with the reader. Sometimes it's because Croaker himself doesn't know (and doesn't care) why the Company is doing what they're doing. And that's fine. That's realistic, especially for military life. But when we're told &quot;I understood now,&quot; it'd be nice for Cook to go ahead and let us know why something happened, especially when it was of apparently monumental importance. Frustrating and avoidable.<br />Like I said previously, I'm not someone who wanted &quot;The Black Company&quot; to be &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; -- quite to the contrary. And I've been told that subsequent novels in this series are better than this first volume. But I'm not a reader who is interested in plowing through a few hundred or thousand pages of multiple novels waiting for the good parts to come along. So I'm probably not going to pick up the rest of this series.<br />&quot;The Black Company&quot; isn't an awful book -- which puts it head and shoulders above most fantasy bestsellers -- but it's still not good enough.<br />If any of this sounds like you might have the same sort of reaction that I did, pick this up from the library before putting down hard-earned money for &quot;The Black Company.&quot;t's still not good enough.<br />If any of this sounds like you might have the same sort of reaction that I did, pick this up from the library before putting down hard-earned money for &quot;The Black Company.&quot;	2001-01-08

While Stevenson was a heck of a fantasy writer -- check out his &quot;Bottle Imp&quot; if you doubt it -- Tim Powers is perhaps the best fantasy writer most fans have never heard of.<br />And in typical Powers fashion, in &quot;On Stranger Tides,&quot; he tosses in everything he thinks he might need in a pirate novel -- historical figures, naval action, a noble man in a bad situation, voodoo, jungles and so on -- and a few things only he would think to link to the rest and comes up with another hit, and my favorite Powers novel.<br />The action here careens back and forth across the Caribbean and if Powers isn't wrestling crazy ideas to the ground as he does in &quot;The Stress of Her Regard&quot; or &quot;The Anubis Gates,&quot; it's only because, this time around, the play's the thing.<br />This is a book I loan out to all of my sea-loving friends, knowing that they'll devour it and hand it back to me, more battered than ever, but it's a book I can't keep to myself. Now, if only a hardbound edition would come out, so that I have a chance at actually having a copy in decent condition.<br />This is a &quot;grab it if you see it&quot; buy for fans of fantasy, pirates or wild adventure stories. &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; is a dynamite novel by one of the best genre authors working today.	2000-12-28

When you've got the devil as a nice guy telling the true story of the Fall and Lestat meeting Jesus, why would anyone need more?<br />And, judging by the reviews here, I guess the Anne Rice True Believers don't. But for those of us who don't find the core concepts of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; all that radical -- lord knows that they've shown up enough in genre fiction, television, movies and comics for the novelty to wear off -- tend to find &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; so thin, it's transparent.<br />Even the gawd awful &quot;Taltos&quot; didn't wean me off Anne Rice, but &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; finally did.

But, again, I lived with it -- I figured those involved were swamped in the last days before the launch of 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons and I was still able to pull lots of goodies from the book to use in my campaigns, even if I couldn't run it straight as was.<br />Of course, none of that would happen with &quot;Diablerie,&quot; right? After all, this was the third edition version of &quot;Awakening,&quot; and since it presumably would just mean updating the previous book for the new edition rules, it would be easy to fix the errors that had come before. Nope.<br />First off, &quot;Diablerie&quot; isn't a 3E version of &quot;Awakening,&quot; although it has a lot in common. The most important difference, bigger than the change in editions, is that &quot;Awakening&quot; provided the setting of Tristram and monastery dungeons from the original &quot;Diablo&quot; game. (It also provided early versions of the &quot;Diablo II&quot; classes and some monsters.) This time around, there's no Tristram, and the notes provided in &quot;Diablerie&quot; make it sound as though that setting won't be in the forthcoming adventure book &quot;Diablo II: Hell and Back&quot; either. So I won't be tossing out &quot;Awakening&quot; and having only one book of this sort on my shelves.<br />Instead, &quot;Diablerie&quot; is meant to be a player's supplement for the Diablo world. It has the five computer game classes -- Amazon, Barbarian, Necromancer, Paladin and Sorceress -- written up as full D&amp;D classes. The abilities one gets to select from in the computer game are done in a similar manner here, with players able to pick from the appropriate set of abilities when their characters go up in levels. The magic-using necromancer and sorceress are similar to the standard D&amp;D sorcerer class, but with unique spells and some different class skills.<br />There's also new weapons, loads of magic items (created Diablo fashion, with random prefixes and suffixes making for millions of possible magical items), some monsters and a short introductory adventure. Along with a copy of the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide (and some dice), everything needed to play is here. Sort of.<br />&quot;Diablerie&quot; has an extremely thrown-together feel. Monsters from both Diablo computer games are mixed together here, providing neither simply an introductory set or a greatest hits sampling of monsters, but rather a seemingly random selection of them. In addition to magical items from the two Diablo games, a full page of magical items from the &quot;Hellfire&quot; add-on for the original game is included, but the socketed weapons which are so well-known in the new game aren't. We also get reprints of several skills for no apparent reason, along with two pages of what skills and feats are available, although without any information. &quot;Diablerie&quot; apparently isn't sure whether it really needs the Players Handbook or not, since so much of it is duplicated, yet the most important bits (spell descriptions) are sometimes left out.<br />There's also sloppy editing: After we're told not to use spells from the standard Players Handbook, &quot;Diablerie&quot; repeatedly includes them anyway in isolated cases. (Identify and Greater Magic Weapon from the Players Handbook show up, along with the Flame Wave spell from &quot;Awakening.&quot;)<br />A bigger problem is that the book doesn't really model the game all that well. Sure, it would be a difficult, perhaps impossible task to make Diablo exactly fit D&amp;D, with their very different magic systems and so on. In many cases a very good effort has been made (fatigue and item damage rules are well-done), but in others, some of the most popular elements of the computer game are casually cast aside for no apparent reason: The ubiquitous necromancer's Bone Spear spell, for some reason, is a modified version of the Players Handbook Spiritual Weapon spell, instead of a necromantic version of Lightning Bolt. I'm playing a necromancer in Hell Mode in the computer game, and I can't recall ever seeing a bone spear stabbing a victim over and over and over again.<br />A final nitpick: The book repeatedly refers to the planet the game is set on as Khanduras. Players of the computer game know that's the country the first game and the first act of the second game are set it. Yes, the planet's real name, Sanctuary, is cheesy as can be, but come on, guys.<br />When &quot;Awakening&quot; came out, I picked it up as a way to spice up my D&amp;D game in the weeks before the new version of the D&amp;D game came out, and pulled out monsters and magic items that my players had never encountered before. That's probably the best use of &quot;Diablerie,&quot; too, but I'm pleased with the new 3rd edition Dungeon Master's Guide, and all the new stuff it offers, so I'm unlikely to use this book in that way, given its eccentricities.andbook show up, along with the Flame Wave spell from &quot;Awakening.&quot;)<br />A bigger problem is that the book doesn't really model the game all that well.

Books	3	1	3	N	N	Ouch.	&quot;Where is Joe Merchant&quot; is a professional enough work, but one that doesn't have the wild inventiveness and manic spark of Carl Hiaasen's work or the sweet charm of Jimmy's other works. It's clearly an attempt to marry the two worlds, but if such an attempt can succeed (and I imagine someone will do it at some point), this book ain't it.<br />In &quot;Tales from Margaritaville,&quot; Jimmy showed that he understood the short story form, infusing his tales with characters and situations that also appear on the album &quot;Off to See the Lizard.&quot; Lightning doesn't strike twice, though, with this work. The settings and characters seem forced rather than charming, which is a shame, as Jimmy is certainly capable of creating settings and characters to rival the TV shows &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; or &quot;Ed.&quot; This time around, though, Jimmy fails to put such on paper.<br />This is only a book worth reading by the Parrothead completist.	2000-12-06

In other words, a real human being. Her ex-husband is a piece of crap, yes, but not the cartoonish lout we see in the film. In fact, everyone in a Hiaasen novel is a bit of a goofball, once their foibles are looked at unflinchingly, which is part of the fun.<br />Those only familiar with &quot;Strip Tease&quot; via the movie don't get any of that: The good guys are too good to screw up, and the bad guys are too stupid to have any redeeming qualities. And to top it all off, Demi apparently doesn't understand that stripping is meant to titillate, not spiritually enlighten its audience. Those aroused by the film ought to get out more.<br />In fact, the book tops the film in every way, with the possible exception of what Burt Reynolds brings to the film. But even then, in his role as a corrupt politician -- and, ultimately, the engine for the story -- punches are pulled and he's not quite as sleazy as in the book. Apparently, giving people a lesson into how greed is destroying the Everglades was just too heavy for the film audience.<br />Those who liked the film -- and they exist, strangely enough -- still ought to pick up the book, to learn all about the characters and read the situations that didn't make the final cut. For current fans of Hiaasen's work, the book is roughly on par with &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; although much more politically barbed than that work, which took aim at humanity's folly generally.<br />And for Demi Moore, what were you thinking? You owe Carl and his fans a big apology, as well as your own fans, who deserve better.	2000-12-06

In between, the book is almost too full of information, with important movements and sects getting only a paragraph at times, due to Armstrong's rush to cover everything, at least in passing. The middle sections desperately need a study guide, or a Web browser (not available when I first read the book, in its first edition in the early 1990s) to find out more about the different thinkers and movements.<br />But even at its densest, Armstrong does an excellent job of discussing the crisis points all three religions came to and how each handled it. (Have a thick skin when your faith is addressed, as the all-too-human members of each major religion have dropped the ball, and Armstrong shows how it happened, although she never passes judgement.)<br />Not a quick read, or a light one, but educational and inspiring. Whether used to enrich one's understanding of their own faith, or for insight into the world around us, &quot;A History of God&quot; is an excellent overview of the history of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.	2000-12-06

The game is also the first computer game-style RPG (as opposed to the category of games console gamers call RPGs), and this manual serves as an excellent guide to the game.<br />The book details each of the three classes, gives advice on strategies, has write-ups on all the equipment, lists and explains the magical suffixes and prefixes, gives a complete shrine list, goes into detail on the spells, gives stats and strategy for each of the many monsters and describes the quests (broken down into the random &quot;minor&quot; quests and the required &quot;major&quot; quests).<br />The few surprises in the game can be spoiled by this book, although they're really not what &quot;Diablo&quot; is about, really -- and the fun of smacking around the monsters in the dungeons beneath Tristram is undiminished.<br />The book also provides information on things I wouldn't have thought to ask -- like where those extra staircases in the dungeon lead to.<br />Advanced gamers, or those who played &quot;Diablo&quot; on computer likely won't want or need this, but for everyone else, this book is an excellent companion to the game, and is a quality product, attractive to look at and clearly written.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a 31st level Sorcerer calling me back to Tristram ...	2000-12-02

Some reviewers have thought that Varley's examination of matters of faith in previous novels was the sign of an unreligious or anti-religious author. Apparently, more than two millenia of theological discussions are somehow anti-God for these people. I find Varley's examination of faith in this trilogy, &quot;Steel Beach&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot; to be bracing and, if anything, to turn my thoughts Heavenward much more than any sappy &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; story could do. (Of course, I also like Morrow's &quot;Towing Jehovah,&quot; so maybe I'm already damned from the get-go.)<br />I've read far more books over the years than I care to count, but every few years, I dig out my old Science Fiction Book Club copies of Varley's classic trilogy, including the hardback version of &quot;Demon&quot; with the giant naked Marilyn Monroe (!) on the cover and revisit Gaia.<br />The trilogy is a masterpiece of characterization, setting, plot and theme, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; in my opinion.<br />A must-read series for fans of science fiction and science fantasy.

So if you like &quot;Titan,&quot; the ride just gets better from here.<br />Having said that, why should you pick up &quot;Titan?&quot; Isn't this the same book as &quot;Rendezvous with Rama?&quot; Well, yes and no. The book is about astronauts exploring the environment inside an alien space station. But from there, the core concept is all filtered through the mind of John Varley.<br />Beyond being a straight exploration story, Varley also discusses issue of women in power, homosexuality vs. heterosexuality, altenate breeding relationships for alien species (nothing you can possibly imagine) and some fun with the science of angels. And, of course, it's here that Varley begins his deepest exploration between man and God, although to say more would be to give away too much of the book.<br />First and foremost, though, &quot;Titan&quot; is an adventure story of the highest caliber, with a heroic lead, weird creatures, alien settings, a warm heart and a very sharp mind.

Of course, this isn't a fairy tale, and living up to all that an insane alien &quot;goddess&quot; has put on her shoulders is too much for anyone, even a hero.<br />And that's the set-up for &quot;Wizard,&quot; the second of three books in the Gaia Trilogy. Whereas the first story was an exploration adventure in the &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; mold, and the third story (&quot;Demon&quot;) invites comparisons to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, &quot;Wizard&quot; is an odd little story that mixes a classic fantasy quest to redeem a fallen hero with science fiction action that is inspired (both by the author and the characters involved) by World War II movies.<br />Along the way, Varley flexes his imaginative skills again, outdoing the weird alien creations of &quot;Titan&quot; with even more genetically engineered wonders and monstrosities, many of which stick in the imagination long after the book has been put down: I can never think of a buzz bomb in the same way again, nor a blimp, an angel or centaur.<br />There will be some who find this book, like the others in this series, a bit too racy for them: One of Cirocco's chores is to be part of the breeding cycle for one of the alien species, although not in the way one might expect. It's a great character bit, an interesting bit of xenobiology and a good plot engine. It's also blantant sexuality, so this book isn't for those who are uncomfortable with such stuff.<br />For the rest of us, though, &quot;Wizard&quot; is an amazing book, chronicling the rise of a fallen hero through an amazing alien landscape that's easily one of the most interesting settings speculative fiction has ever produced.<br />A must-read for adult (or adult-minded) science fiction and fantasy fans.	2000-11-29
US	51092016	R1JCQGTQRYVDQ0	0441785654	247619839	Steel Beach	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Weird and wonderful	More than one of my friends has picked up &quot;Steel Beach&quot; on my recommendation, soon after asked me what on Earth I was thinking, and then soon after that told me it was one of the best books they've ever read.<br />Some people may initially find John Varley a challenging writer, if only because he doesn't flinch at thinking about how sexual mores will change along with science fiction staples as bio-engineering, space colonies and artificial intelligence. As a result, compared to most science fiction, &quot;Steel Beach&quot; initially feels as though it's obsessed with sex, although it's no more so than modern society's sexual obsessions projected forward over the centuries.<br />Once one gets beyond the discussions of future sexuality that would raise even Hugh Hefner's eyebrows, &quot;Steel Beach&quot; turns out to be about much more. There's a discussion of the role of a free press, celebrity-as-journalist, libertarianism, the role of ambition in human history and, once again, the relationship between God and man.<br />While not a short novel, &quot;Steel Beach&quot; feels like one, as Varley sends protagonist Hildy Johnson (look up the name on IMDB.com if you don't already get the joke) on a wild roller coaster ride that works both as a straight story and serves to make the thematic medicine go down smoother than smooth: &quot;Steel Beach&quot; never feels like Varley's got a Point To Make.<br />Ultimately, the book is a wonderful showcase for Varley's Eight Worlds setting -- aliens who sympathize with whales and dolphins have kicked humanity off the planet, almost exterminating them in the process -- and is a big wet kiss to Robert Heinlein's science fiction and worldview.<br />A rollicking good read, equal to his Gaean Trilogy, and only excelled by them in that we (so far) have only seen one book's worth of character development with Hildy, as opposed to the full arc in &quot;Titan,&quot; &quot;Wizard&quot; and &quot;Demon.&quot;<br />A must-buy for Varley fans and fans of Robert Heinlein.arley fans and fans of Robert Heinlein.	2000-11-28
US	51092016	RUDBHRWPSGQ9J	0441006434	11987625	The Golden Globe (Eight Worlds)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Flawed, but with flashes of vintage Varley brilliance.	Based as it is in the same solar system as &quot;Steel Beach,&quot; and with a Shakespearian actor in the lead, I'm afraid I had my hopes set too high for this book, wanting it to be another &quot;Demon&quot; or &quot;Steel Beach.&quot;<br />It isn't.<br />In contrast to the mix of great character, inventive settings and eye-popping plot those two boasted, &quot;Golden Globe&quot; relies much more heavily on Varley's character-building skills, with both setting and plot handled ably, but made much less central than in his other novels.<br />Which isn't to say that Sparky isn't an interesting character -- he is, no doubt about that -- but he's an often frustrating figure and one that it's not terribly rewarding to spend time on. Varley loves his flawed protagonists, no doubt about it, but Sparky isn't so much flawed as flat-out broken. He's a troubling and unreliable narrator, and there were stretches where I was frankly sick of him and ready to put the book aside. (This from someone who's managed to track down all of Varley's work after being turned on to the Gaea Trilogy in my youth.)<br />While this isn't Varley's weakest novel -- that would be &quot;Millennium,&quot; without a doubt -- it's not of the same caliber of his other novels, which were much more crowd-pleasing affairs. Varley clearly set out to do something different with &quot;Golden Globe,&quot; and while that's laudable, I don't think he pulled off the character study of one screwed up little boy nearly as well as he could have.<br />Read this only after devouring &quot;Steel Beach&quot; and the Gaea Trilogy.	2000-11-28

Not here.<br />Compared to the Gaea Trilogy or &quot;Steel Beach,&quot; &quot;Millennium&quot; feels anemic, as though this were a Varley short story stretched to short novel length by another writer.<br />Still, it's better than the movie.	2000-11-28

This isn't the book for the gamers who want a supplement to contain more bitchin' powers and the (apparent) answers to some of the great mysteries of the game setting.<br />Instead, this is jumping in at the deep end of the desperation, confusion and madness of the end of the world, as the vampires see it. Fourteen and fifteen generations later, the power of Caine's curse is wearing off, and vampires are being created who are more human and less vampire than those who have come before them. They aren't masters of the night, they aren't capable of living as humans. They're pathetic creatures living in fear and ignorance, not even knowing that there's an entire World of Darkness ready to do them in for reasons they won't live long enough to learn.<br />Instead of the high Gothic opera of most &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; games, &quot;Time of the Thin Blood&quot; is a squalid, brutish and brutal game supplement that stinks of fear sweat and, along the way, gives reasons for the rest of the vampires to be sweating blood along with the thin-blooded.<br />And, of course, there are some bitchin' new powers: The thin-blooded can't do much of what more potent vampires can do, but they can do some things that none of their elders (and betters) can do, including make babies. The rules for these half-human/half-vampire dhampires are also given. Would a player want to play one? Not most players in most games. But &quot;Time of the Thin Blood&quot; works best on its own (with the core rulebook, of course) or for the rare player who doesn't want to be a Lestat-like master of the night.<br />And there's also some answers to the big questions, or at least an apparent answer that poses some bigger questions. The game master-only section at the back tells a brief tale: Something very old and very nasty wakes up in India, the supernatural world rises against it, and the world of VtM changes, getting more desperate and somewhat less populated ...<br />This is the stuff of nightmares and urban legends.

Remember when every barely informed Chicken Little was worried that roleplaying games were a guide to evil?<br />This is the book they were scared of.<br />In the pages of &quot;Infernalism: The Path of Screams,&quot; the writers explore why sane and intelligent people would embrace evil, what it means to be evil and the cost. It's not pretty, it's not attractive, but it's some of the most thought-provoking reading I've come across, game-related or no.<br />It's absolutely essential for the wonderful &quot;Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade&quot; game, incredibly useful for the whole family of World of Darkness games and is, frankly, worth getting for any RPG game master whose game features servants of darkness (I'm planning on dusting it off and using it for an upcoming Dungeons and Dragons adventure, for instance, to add some weight to the classic evil wizards and clerics).<br />This is a book for genuinely mature readers not because there's blood and gore and bare breasts -- none of that has anything to do with maturity in modern society -- but because it asks you to think hard about moral choices and the impact they have on a person and their world.<br />Quite simply one of the best RPG books of all time.	2000-11-22

Here, in addition to a strangely lightly detailed College of Wizardry --  which makes an awful lot of changes to the game world for a  &quot;generic&quot; supplement -- are too-powerful spells and proficiencies  as powerful as low-level spells. This was a great idea, but DM's are better  off finding a copy of either the Glantri boxed set or old D&amp;D Gazetteer  and lifting the ideas there. Some day, some one will create a great school  of magic supplement. This isn't it. (Of course, since Wizards of the Coast  will be doing a Harry Potter roleplaying game soon, maybe the wait won't be  too terribly long at that ...)	2000-06-26

I'll be dropping Scavengers and Acid Spitters and Fallen Ones into my dungeons. Maybe my players will recognize them, maybe they won't. An upcoming necromancer archvillain will also have spells the players have never encountered before, drawing on this book, the wonderful-but-impossible-to-find Complete Necromancer's Handbook and the skills in this book. Great stuff all around.<br />The other way to use the book, though, isn't as successful: The dungeon crawl is fun - and HUGE - but the editing mistakes that were mildly annoying in earlier parts of the book (at least one monster's hit dice is clearly a major typo) become a real problem here, with items listed on the maps that don't show up in the description and vice versa. (The two chest sizes allegedly indicated on the map are actually both shown with an identical image, for instance.) And while Tristram is described - with spoilers, for those who haven't played the original computer game - there's no map, which seems an odd omission.<br />Having said that, though, this measures up quite well against the classic &quot;Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; module from AD&amp;D's heyday, and I'll likely be using this as a straight forward dungeon crawl on those occasions when my full gaming group can't all get together. But even if you just use the source material that make up the first ¾ of the book, &quot;Diablo II: The Awakening&quot; is a great value and a terrific campaign resource for any DM.sion.<br />Having said that, though, this measures up quite well against the classic &quot;Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; module from AD&amp;D's heyday, and I'll likely be using this as a straight forward dungeon crawl on those occasions when my full gaming group can't all get together.

Aside from a few editing errors -- What's the Hit Dice of a Flesh Hunter? Why are all the chests on the maps the same size, even though the text says there's two types? -- this is an excellent supplement.<br />It works,  reasonably well, as a mini-setting and combined with the Diablo II boxed  set and the free &quot;Quick Start&quot; Diablo adventure available from  the WotC Web site, I could see using this as a way to get new players into  AD&amp;D. (An actual map of Tristram, though, would have been nice.)<br />The  extrapolations of Diablo character types in AD&amp;D terms are also nice. I  may well have AD&amp;D paladins use the Diablo II paladin spell list in  future.<br />It works even better, though, as a way to shake up your current  campaign, with 25 or so new monster types (individual subbreeds pump up the  total number of &quot;monsters,&quot; in true Diablo style), dozens of new  spells, and a magic item table that will make you think twice about giving  out another boring Long Sword +2.<br />I look forward to dropping various  monsters, treasures and spells into my ongoing campaign.<br />A great  supplement, and a purchase I'm glad that I made.	2000-05-09

(They're enjoyable, but enough is enough is enough already.)<br />Instead, this time around, we get mostly juvenalia from Gaiman, at least as far as  his DC/Vertigo career is concerned. As with much of his work, they're all  played in minor key, but they fit in well with the established ongoing  series from which they draw.<br />The &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; pieces don't  equal the heights to which the series has soared, but they're more  user-friendly for new readers and enjoyable in their own right.<br />The  &quot;Brother Power, The Geek&quot; story is of middling interest, although  it's amusing to see how Gaiman intertwines it with the &quot;Swamp  Thing&quot; mythos.<br />The &quot;Hellblazer&quot; story proves that John  Constantine's best stories are about sorrow, loss and fear, not demonic  hosts and abominations both mortal and otherwise (although they certainly  are fun).<br />And, for those who can't live without a pasty-faced member of  the Endless slouching through, &quot;Sandman Midnight Theater&quot; (a  collaboration with the incomparable Matt Wagner) forms a nice bridge  between &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Sandman Mystery Theater.&quot;<br />This  is a glimpse into a world of magic that can be just as mundane as the  &quot;ordinary&quot; world.<br />Worth buying for those very familiar or very  new to the DC/Vertigo line of books, especially the main branch that split  off from DC Comics as their own shared &quot;universe.&quot;	2000-02-11

These stories are a revelation, both into the startling talents of Ennis and Dillon and for pointing the way towards a more emotionally mature mainstream comic industry.<br />Sure, there's plenty of  &quot;Preacher&quot;-style over the top stuff here: If Constantine isn't  bleeding, he's vomitting or urinating, often on a humiliated enemy. But we  also get emotional depths DC/Vertigo books are all alleged to have, but  rarely do.<br />In particular, the absolute finest &quot;Hellblazer&quot;  story ever, &quot;Heartland,&quot; doesn't ever feature John in the story  directly, but his absence haunts Kit, his ex-girlfriend, as she flees home  to Dublin. It's a story that conveys the bittersweet feeling of loving  someone not good for you, and making that wise move of staying away from  them, even through the pain.<br />This is smart, funny, touching, scary and,  yes, horrific stuff.
