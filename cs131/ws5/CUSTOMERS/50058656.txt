The book explains how various conspiracy beliefs have been shifted into a realm normally occupied by such stigmatized and underground beliefs as those of the New Age and UFO subcultures.  In addition conspiracy beliefs in the rise of a New World Order, beliefs in UFO abductions, government experiments in mind control, forbidden knowledge, occult science, alternative medicine, revisionist history, and speculations about the nature of reality have been combined into what Barkun refers to as \\"superconspiracies\\" which provide a systematic epistemological understanding of reality. <br /> <br />First though I have some criticisms of the book.  Barkun obviously supports the establishment view of history, politics, and science.  As such he seems to believe that conspiracy theories are \\"unfalsifiable\\" which he defines to be the determiner of a scientific theory (an arguable point) and therefore can be easily dismissed.  Barkun dismisses the claims and beliefs of various liberty loving individuals who seek to track the development of an all-encompassing global government without really backing up his dismissals except by appealing more to establishment beliefs.  Further, Barkun seems to believe that \\"improvisational millennialism\\" can be dangerous, leading to violence.  His claims on this point appear overly alarmist, particularly in the light of the very dangers posed today by modern governments.  Finally, Barkun refers to conspiracy beliefs as \\"right wing\\" and part of the \\"antigovernment right\\".  Such references to traditional political categories of right versus left seem feeble in the light of the encompassing nature of conspiracy theories.  Indeed, conspiracy theories are as often left wing as right wing, and simplistic categorizations of themserve no further purpose than providing a conveninent label with which to stigmatize and dismiss.  Nevertheless, despite these criticisms much in this book is interesting in that it provides a systematic approach to understanding the convergence of various subcultures as well as the rise of millennial beliefs among the conspiracist underground. <br /> <br />Two central things to most conspiracy beliefs are the presence of a hidden organization controlling events (usually the Illuminati, based on the very real quasi-masonic secret society of the Bavarian Illuminati founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776) and the rise of a New World Order (often with reference to Bush I's speech identifying a \\"new world order\\").  Barkun outlines in successive chapters the origins of the Illuminati in conspiracy literature as well as the role of the New World Order.  Barkun considers both religious millennial sources involving the coming of Antichrist (particularly with reference to Christian dispensationalism) as well esoteric \\"secular\\" sources focusing on elite conspirators.  Barkun considers the role of various government agencies in conspiracy beliefs including particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as attempts at mind control by the CIA.  Barkun also discusses the notorious black helicopters and U.N. concentration camps which are bandied about by many New World Order conspiracy theorists. <br /> <br />Three prominent individuals played an important role in the creation of late 1990s conspiracy theories.  These included the researcher Jim Keith, who notoriously emphasized both black helicopters, UFOs, and CIA mind control experiments.  The tax protestor and favorite of the militias Milton William Cooper, a former military officer who expressed belief in UFO conspiracies at one point.  And, the eccentric New Age conspiracist David Icke, who has made various outrageous claims involving New World Order conspiracies and a \\"reptilian agenda\\".  Both Jim Keith andMilton William Cooper died mysteriously which has led to much speculation on their deaths by researchers (Cooper died in a shoot-out with local authorities). <br /> <br />Barkun also discusses the role of UFOs in conspiracy literature.  Barkun believes that UFOs which are actively believed in by a sizable portion of the population serve to legitimize conspiracy beliefs.  (Of course his argument here assumes that conspiracy beliefs are illegitimate to begin with!)  Barkun also discusses various esoteric beliefs in the existence of an inner earth, both in pulp literature (including especially the Shaver mystery) as well as in non-fictional travel narratives such as those of Ferdinand Ossendowski.  Barkun also discusses the role of anti-Catholicism, anti-masonry, and anti-Semitism in various conspiracy beliefs as well as the rise of these beliefs within certain UFO circles.  Barkun seems overly enthusiastic to attribute these labels to individuals who may take alternative views on religion to those expressed in the mainstream.  Finally, Barkun turns his attention to various conspiracy beliefs that arose out of the September 11, 2001 disaster. <br /> <br />This book provides a good compendium for understanding various conspiracy beliefs.  However, it must be approached with caution because Barkun obviously represents an establishment viewpoint opposed to all alternative modes of thinking.   <br />	2005-10-09

Jack London was a rugged adventurer who was born into poverty and only became wealthy after his success as a novelist.  His early experiences, which he writes about in this novel, were particularly important in the shaping of his thought and writings.  London was a very thoughtful writer and all of his writings are philosophical in nature.  Philosophically London was influenced by such thinkers as Charles Darwin (and his notion of the \\"survival of the fittest\\"), Friedrich Nietzsche (whose superman ideal is seen in London's ultra-masculine heroic characters), and William James (whose psychological theories regarding religion play an important part in the writing of this book).  London was a devout socialist (he had been born into poverty and witnessed firsthand the oppression of the working class and the poor by the capitalists); however, his socialism is highly idiosyncratic in that all of his heroes are rugged individualists.  London also recognized the harm that alcohol had done to himself and to youth of his generation which led him to believe that Prohibition was necessary (although he continued to drink).  While London insists that he is not an alcoholic or dipsomaniac, his experiences with alcohol show the harmful effects that it had upon him. <br /> <br />_John Barleycorn_ began as a suggestion from London's second wife, Charmian, that he write about his experiences with alcohol.  London, who had originally opposed woman's suffrage, had just voted for a bill that would give women the vote because he believed that women would vote for Prohibition.  Indeed, the novel _John Barleycorn_ became popular with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party which actively campaigned for Prohibition.  While London could not have foreseen some of the more disastrous consequences of Prohibition, such as the formation of the mob and organized crime, he certainly understood the dangers that alcohol posed because he had experienced them firsthand. <br /> <br />_John Barleycorn_ relates the adventures of the young Jack London beginning with his earliest experiences with alcohol as a young lad of only five years old.  London had been born into poverty and forced to work in a cannery.  London, being an adventurous sort with an active mind, grew dissatisfied with his life of toil, and eventually became an oyster pirate.  It was at this point where his first real encounters with alcohol and saloon life began.  London describes his adventures as an oyster pirate along with his experiences at the saloons and the subtle rules that accompanied the drinking game.  Eventually London returned to steady work; however, he quickly experienced the immoralities of the capitalist system when he was asked to shovel coal and made to work the job of two men.  London relates further adventures in which he became an unemployed vagrant and was arrested for vagrancy and a gold prospector in the Yukon.  London also shows how \\"John Barleycorn\\" came to play an important role in his life, as a means for easing social relationships.  London also describes his experiences with school and how he attained his education (including a year at the university level) through extreme efforts.  London makes use of Viking imagery throughout many of his descriptive passages showing his love for adventure and Nordic folklore.  Eventually London was to make his way in the world as an author and he became very wealthy doing so.  Later when London had achieved both wealth and fame he was to take a series of voyages to Hawaii, the Tropics, and the South Seas which served as an impetus for new stories.  During this time, London became \\"sun sick\\" and took to drink to ease his troubles brought on by the tropical climate and the diseases that accompanied it.  When London returnedhome he continued drinking heavily.  London describes his encounters with \\"the White Logic\\", a gloomy depression brought on by drink, his alcoholic reveries and philosophical musings, and his encounters with death (\\"the Noseless One\\").  Indeed, the thought of suicide was to plague London for much of his life.  At one point London decided that he would stop drinking; however, he eventually realized that he was unable to do so and decides that he will continue to drink in moderation.  However, he came to believe that Prohibition was necessary to prevent the harmful effects of alcohol on the youth.  While London argues that he is not an alcoholic, it is clear however that alcohol has had a profound effect on his constitution and mind. <br /> <br />_John Barleycorn_ is a fascinating adventure novel which traces Jack London's life from the time he was a young boy into his adult years as a famous writer.  The novel also shows the harmful effects of alcohol on London and shows the need for restraint.  Like a great deal of London's work, this novel reveals London's defining social conscience which framed so much of his thinking.  In addition, it provides for a fascinating read and is a great source of entertainment. <br />	2005-09-28

We will grind you revolutionists down under our heel, and we shall walk upon your faces.\\"  -  Mr. Wickson from _The Iron Heel_ <br /> <br />_The Iron Heel_ by American writer Jack London, first written in 1908, and republished by Lawrence Hill Books, is a profoundly philosophical work in the form of fiction advocating the alternative of radical socialism and revolution to the capitalist system.  Jack London was a rugged adventurer and a novelist who was born into extreme poverty and became an idealistic proponent of socialism.  London was influenced philosophically by such profound thinkers as Charles Darwin (whose concept of the \\"survival of the fittest\\" plays such a prevalent role in many of his stories as the \\"law of tooth and claw\\"), Herbert Spencer (social Darwinist philosopher), Friedrich Nietzsche (whose superman ideal plays a prominent role among London's ultra-masculine protagonists), and Karl Marx (whose economic theories and belief in the inevitability of proletarian revolution underlay many of London's socialist beliefs).  Born into poverty, London had seen first hand the harmful effects of the plutocracy/oligarchy of elite capitalists on the poor and working class, and in this novel he puts the words of an indictment of the capitalist class into the mouth of his working class hero as having mismanaged society.  London argues that there is no reason for anyone to be starving within society given the increased production capabilities of the modern age as compared with those of the stone age. <br /> <br />_The Iron Heel_ is supposedly a document left by one Avis Everhard, a female revolutionist in the earlier half of the twentieth century, extolling the heroism of her working class philosopher-socialist husband Ernest Everhard who fought the plutocracy.  This document supposedly has been preserved to reflect the era in which the oligarchy took its most oppressive measures against the working class by forming the \\"Iron Heel\\" to crush the working class and the middle class together.  However, according to the story the proletariat revolution eventually triumphed bringing about a new era in subsequent centuries.  London believed this triumph was inevitable given the theories of Karl Marx which Ernest expounds upon within the story. <br /> <br />_The Iron Heel_ begins at the home of John Cunningham, Avis Everhard's father, where a group of Christian churchmen have met to discuss the problems of the working class.  John Cunningham was a physicist, who has taken a particular interest in philosophy and economics.  As part of their discussion, Ernest Everhard is invited to represent the working class.  London's description of the thrust and parry of verbal sparing is very effective.  Ernest effectively defeats in argument all the men and shows them the philosophy of the working class.  Later one of the Christian churchmen, Bishop Morehouse, will come to embrace socialism himself, but will be dismissed as \\"overworked\\" and \\"insane\\" by the ruling oligarchy.  Avis Everhard, who eventually falls in love with and marries Ernest, described as a Nietzschean \\"blond beast\\" - an ultra-masculine heroic muscle man from the working class, and her father will also come to embrace socialism.  Ernest eventually must confront the oligarchs in their natural environment.  London's description of this confrontation at an elite club resembles his descriptions of dog fights from some of his other stories and is very effective.  Ernest also confronts a group of middle class businessmen who propose to \\"bust the trusts\\" and who Ernest dismisses as \\"machine breakers\\".  Eventually the oligarchy comes to make war against labor through the formation of the \\"Iron Heel\\".  London describes the militia of the oligarchy as similar to the Black Hundreds of Russia who actively opposed the revolution.  The story traces the development of the opposition and the working class revolt as they seek to fight against the capitalist oppressors. <br /> <br />London's socialism is highly idiosyncratic.  On the one hand, he advocates collectivism, and yet his chief protagonists are all powerful individualists.  This conflict between the brute Darwinistic struggle for survival and his socialistic ideals is seen in all of his stories.  While London's socialism is certainly overly idealistic, he could not have foreseen the terrors that developed within the Soviet experiment.  One could just as well imagine the lone right wing hero going up against the left wing oligarchy and the media in today's world.  It is certainly possible to imagine that had London lived longer he would have come to reject this nave sort of socialism and may have become a powerful force for the reaction.  Some have also suggested that _The Iron Heel_ is highly prophetic in that it foretells the creation of fascism in which an alliance between the labor castes and the capitalists developed.  Like all London's stories though, _The Iron Heel_ is expertly crafted with superb imagery and London's social conscience is revealed throughout. <br />	2005-09-26

One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith there came thereout blood and water.  - Gospel of John, 19:34. <br /> <br />\\". . . whosoever possesses this Holy Lance and understands the powers it serves, holds in his hand the destiny of the world.\\" <br /> <br />_Secrets of the Holy Lance:  The Spear of Destiny in History and Legend_ by independent esoteric researchers Jerry E. Smith and George Piccard published by Adventures Unlimited Press is a fascinating account of the Spear of Destiny, its history, and the role this sacred relic used to pierce the side of Christ as he suffered upon the Cross has in the rise and fall of nations and empires.  The authors are indebted to their friend the late Jim Keith, occult and conspiracy research, whose researches on mind control, the Illuminati, secret societies, and the New World Order global tyranny proved most prescient in the light of the events following the September 11, 2001 horrors.  This book traces the development of this occult relic, believed to hold powers over the destiny of men and nations as it passed from one great leader to another, culminating in the seizure of the spear (the \\"Heilige Lanze\\") by the megalomaniac madman Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br />The Spear of Destiny was a spear wielded by the Roman centurion Longinus, who became a convert to Christianity, used to pierce the side of Christ as he suffered upon the Cross.  Later legends speak of the spear in conjunction with the Cup of Christ's Holy Blood, the Holy Grail, believed by some to have been taken to Glastonbury in England by Joseph of Arimathea.  Prior to this, the spear had been wielded by Boadicea, the pagan queen, leading an army of brave Celts against the Romans.  The spear also came to be wielded by the Roman emperor Constantine upon his conversion to Christianity (having had a dream in which the sign of Christ appeared in the sky and he was told to conquer under this sign).  The spear also played some role in the lives of theemperor Julian the apostate, who attempted to return Rome to paganism, as well as the barbarian warlord, Atilla the Hun.  In later days, Charlemagne, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the emperor Frederick Barbarossa were believed to have wielded the spear, along with the Knights Templar.  Adolf Hitler, under the influence of various initiatic secret societies ultimately deriving from Blavatskian Theosophy, is believed to have taken an interest in the spear.  The book shows the development of Aryan philosophies through such individuals as Guido von Listz and Rudolph Sebottendorf under the influence of Blavatsky.  Hitler as well as Himmler (the \\"pagan pope\\") took an extreme interest in this holy relic, fueled by his megalomania (perhaps brought about after his experience with a psychologist who attempted to cure him of blindness by showing him the power of the human will).  The Nazis actively sought out relics around the world and may have hidden in South America (Argentina?) or in secret bases in Antarctica after their Third Reich fell apart.  The authors show how various U.F.O. sightings may be linked to Nazi interest in rocketry and flying saucers.  Finally, with the creation of a New World Order, particularly in light of Bush I's speech justifying a \\"new world order\\" oddly reminiscent of a similar speech by Hitler, the Holy Spear has again come to light.  The role of secret societies including the freemasons but also particularly the Skull and Bones fraternity (which has actively taken a role in politics and supplied most of the U.S. presidents and business and political leaders) need not be underestimated.  With the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Patriot Act was put into effect which may justify unconstitutional measures by the government.  These events are oddly reminiscent of the kind of New Order programs specified by the various totalitarian regimes of the past century.  Finally, there is the issue of Antarctica, a vast untamed wilderness, and the various expeditions which have visited this southernmost continent and the believed presence of the spear buried beneath the ice. <br /> <br />For those interested in occult history as well as folklore and legend and conspiracy theory, this book provides a very fascinating account of a holy relic which may influence the events of world history.  Perhaps, the Antichrist is actively using the spear to promote discord among nations until the Second Coming of Christ, a return that is truly expected and hoped for by billions of Christians across the world.   <br />	2005-09-12

The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.  -Disraeli.<br /><br />_Secret Societies and Subversive Movements_ by the British patriot Nesta H. Webster is a fascinating account of the various secret and subversive movements which have plotted against both throne and altar from the most ancient times to the modern day.  The book relies on Webster's previous research regarding the French revolution and the \\"World revolution\\" as well as various documents by individuals such as the Abbe Barruel and Professor Robison outlining the growth and development of secret societies.  The book is cleanly divided into two halves, the first focusing on the past and the second focusing on the present day (the book was written in 1924 following the horrors of the First World War).  Webster's book makes for fascinating reading, explaining fully the rise of secret societies and subversive movements from their most ancient origins in various mystery cults until her time.<br /><br />The first section of this book focuses upon what Webster regards as \\"the past\\".  The book begins by noting the role of the ancient secret tradition in various mystery cults which existed in ancient times.  The book focuses particularly on the Jewish cabala (which Webster argues has been distorted by the Talmud, the Sephir Yetzirah, the Zohar, and other ancient texts).  Webster quotes from individuals such as Eliphas Levi and Gougenot de Mousseaux regarding the role of this ancient system.  Webster then turns her attention to the coming of the redeemer, foreshadowed perhaps in the ancient world traditions, though brought to earth in the person of Jesus Christ.  Webster notes the various modern day distortions which have been claimed about Jesus including those which argue for a \\"Christian\\" socialism and those which claim that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes.  Webster thoroughly refutes both of these claims by reference to Holy Scripture.  Webster also shows how Christianity became distorted by both the Gnostics and the Manicheans as well as other heretics after Christ's death and resurrection.  Following this discussion, Webster turns her attention to the revolt against Islam.  Here she notes particularly disturbing instances within Islam of various subversive movements which advocated outright materialism and atheism.  She shows how these movements claimed to be part of the Islamic tradition; however, upon reaching the higher grades the initiate was informed that he had been duped by religion which was regarded to be a sham.  Webster also notes such notorious Islamic societies as the Assassins, who played an important role in the ancient and medieval world.  Webster next turns her attention to the Templars, noting the blasphemies of which they have been accused as well as their relationship with various Islamic societies.  Webster claims that the beliefs of the Templars bear a striking similarity to those of the false Cabala; in particular, she notes the various distortions of Christianity present in both the Talmud and the lies about Christ present in the Toledot Yeshu.  Webster next turns her attention to occultism, noting the presence of Satanism and Rosicrucianism, particularly as these relate to freemasonry.  Webster also shows how freemasonry has actively conspired against throne and altar, particularly Continental masonry (though she denies the influence of malevolent elements to such a great extent within Anglo-American masonry).  Webster also explains the rise of the Grand Lodge within masonry as well as German templarism and French illuminism.  The influence of Swedenborgianism as well as the influence of various mysterious recurring individuals such as the Comte de Saint-Germain keep recurring within the masonic literature.  Webster also shows the rise of the Jewish cabalists distinguishing between the false cabala (of the Talmud and the Toledot Yeshu) and the true cabala which may have been a precursor of Christianity (in particular the Trinity).  She also shows how Jewish beliefs in a coming Messiah play an important role in their tradition.  Webster also examines the role of the Bavarian Illuminati, a secret society started by Adam Weishaupt, a professor of canon law, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria and modeled after the Jesuit order in many respects.  The Bavarian Illuminati actively plotted against the monarchy, and they became adherents to a rationalist/materialist philosophy upon reaching the higher grades.  Another important figure in the society of the Illuminati was that of Baron von Knigge, referred to as \\"Philo\\" by his Illuminati compatriots.  Webster suggests that the roots of the Illuminati philosophy are to be found in the Jewish cabala, along with the tight linkage between cabalists and various other freemasonic groups.  Webster also notes how Jesuitism and British masonry may provide suitable sources for reaction against subversive elements.<br /><br />Webster next turns her attention to the modern day.  Here, she explains the role of freemasonry in bringing about revolution.  In particular, Webster shows the errors of socialism, a system which claims to be for the working class but which in fact operates against the interests of workers.  Indeed, socialism may be a viable alternative for the finance capitalist.  Webster links several groups which may play a role in the coming revolution.  These include pan-Germanism, Illuminism, Bolshevism, International Finance, British Socialism, and the Jewish peril.  The real initiates may be members of any of these various groups.  Webster also shows the subversive elements within such movements as those surrounding Aleister Crowley and the Theosophical Society.  Finally, Webster traces the role of the Jewish cabala through the many secret societies up until the modern day.<br /><br />This book provides an excellent historical perspective on the inner workings of various secret societies and subversivemovements which operate behind the scenes seeking to obtain power over the lives of billions.	2005-09-11
US	50058656	R2B0IXZS1MATBD	B0007DNP2K	530078354	Works	Books	5	3	5	N	N	The Works of Joseph de Maistre.	_The Works of Joseph de Maistre_ selected, edited, and translated by Jack Lively, consists of various selections from the writings of de Maistre put together in book form.  De Maistre was an arch-reactionary and traditionalist Roman Catholic who advocated a counter-revolution against those revolutionary forces unleashed by the French revolution.  De Maistre had seen the devastation that the revolution brought first hand, he had witnessed the beheadings and the bloodshed, and he believed that its origin was satanic in nature.  De Maistre was staunchly Catholic defending papal infallibility in matters of faith as well as appealing to the pope as an authority in matters of political interest.  In addition, de Maistre was influenced by mysticism and the philosophy of Saint Martin (he was a freemason though he stood for reaction and opposed the influence of the Illumines of Bavaria).  De Maistre also was critical of rationalism and democracy, and although he quotes extensively from thinkers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, often indicating approval for specific statements, he notes equally vigorously his rejection of their rationalist philosophies.  De Maistre wrote in support of prejudice and advocated a national religion, as a traditionalist he saw the will of God embodied in the traditions of nations, including folk customs and language.  In his writings, De Maistre also reveals a hankering for a lost golden age, understood both theosophically and in a Christian context of the age before the Fall and the subsequent age between the Fall and the Deluge.  In his writings, de Maistre describes in particularly horrific detail the role of the executioner within society as well as the role of war.  De Maistre also advocates monarchy (an aristocracy of one) against democratic levelling. <br /> <br />This book consists of the following contents:  an introduction to de Maistre's life and thought by Jack Lively, selections from de Maistre's _Considerations on France_, selections from de Maistre's _Study on Sovereignity_, selections from de Maistre's _The Pope_, selections from de Maistre's _Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions_, selections from de Maistre's _The Saint Petersburg Dialogues_, and selections from de Maistre's _Enlightenment on Sacrifices_.  In each of these works by de Maistre, he reveals his political thinking and argues against rationalism and deism for tradition and Christianity.  Philosophers in the eighteenth century had seen the Lisbon earthquake which tragedy had led many to question the goodness of God.  De Maistre shows specifically how the arguments offered by the Enlightenment philosophes against the Christian God are fallacious, in that His purposes remain mysterious to man.  Similarly, de Maistre sees in the culmination of the French revolution in bloodshed the satanic influence of the mob.  Many of de Maistre's criticisms echo the classical conservative Burke's; however, de Maistre is more radical than Burke in his advocation of absolute tradition.  Some have seen in de Maistre a precursor to modern fascism in that he advocates an absolute national state.  However, I believe these indications represent a distortion of de Maistre's thought.  De Maistre was fundamentally Catholic unlike later elitist philosophers such as Nietzsche.  While some have argued that de Maistre's \\"legislator\\" may come to resemble Nietzsche's \\"superman\\" ideal, this particular argument seems to be problematic. <br /> <br />This book offers a fine selection from the writings of a unique political thinker from the eighteenth century who remained a steadfast traditionalist and counter-revolutionary opposing the forces of democratic leveling and the French revolution.  While many of these excerpts are available elsewhere in unabridged form, this book offers a fine compendium of those writings of de Maistre which may be otherwise difficult to find.  It is to be recommended to all who want to understand this profoundly reactionary figure.   <br />	2005-09-09
US	50058656	R3OBPEKX4K4DAY	1586170775	400654923	Literary Giants, Literary Catholics	Books	5	62	70	N	N	Essays on Literary Catholics.	_Literary Giants, Literary Catholics_, published by Ignatius Press, by the traditional Catholic convert and apologist Joseph Pearce, consists of essays on a variety of topics dealing with Catholic culture and the primary literary figures involved in the Catholic revival which were originally published in various journals and especially in the _Saint Austin Review_.  These essays focus on Catholic writers and thinkers who incorporated their Catholic beliefs into their art and writings and sought to defend the tradition of the Church against modernity.  Joseph Pearce, a convert to Catholicism, regards himself to be a \\"cultural apologist\\" as opposed to a theologian or an apologist who relies strictly on rational arguments to defend the faith.   <br /> <br />This book covers a wide variety of topics all dealing with the Catholic literary revival.  The book begins by discussing this revival among the Victorians including the romantic movement influenced by Coleridge and Woodsworth, the traditionalist revolution in Anglicanism led by Cardinal Newman (who eventually converted to Roman Catholicism), and the art of the pre-Raphaelites.  In addition, the Catholic revival came to effect the Decadents, who sought God in their own way as a means to overcome sin by facing the darkness, including Baudelaire, Huysmans, and Wilde (all of whom converted to Catholicism).  Throughout this discussion, the relationship between tradition and conversion is explained.  Pearce also discusses the role of tradition in modern English literature including T. S. Eliot, Evelyn Waugh, and Siegfried Sassoon.  The second section of this book is devoted to essays featuring the apologetic duo, Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton (nicknamed \\"the Chesterbelloc\\" by George Bernard Shaw).  Pearce shows how Roman Catholicism came to play an important part in the life of Chesterton who eventually converted.  The writings of Belloc and Chesterton are both highly apologetic in nature and both focus on the economic theory of distributism, based on the social teachings of the Catholic church.  Distributism provides a third way alternative to the excesses of both socialism and capitalism and is in agreement with the encyclical _Rerum Novarum_ of Pope Leo XIII.  Pearce presents several interesting essays focusing on both Chesterton and Belloc, including an essay where he argues that both would oppose the modern European Union (contrary to the suggestion of another writer) and in which he exonerates Chesterton of the fascism smear (distributism being fundamentally and diametrically opposed to fascist statism).  Essays on Maurice Baring, R. H. Benson, Maisie Ward, and John Seymour are also presented.  The third section of this book deals with \\"the wasteland\\", particularly the aftermath of the First World War and the despair which followed.  Pearce discusses poets who opposed the horrors of mass warfare including Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen.  Pearce also discusses the modernism versus traditionalism at the root of T. S. Eliot and his epic poem _The Wasteland_ as well as the influence of Dante on Eliot.  Pearce also discusses the modernist turned Catholic writer Evelyn Waugh as well as Roy Campbell who came to embrace Catholicism in Spain.  The fourth section of this book is devoted to J. R. R. Tolkien and \\"the Inklings\\".  Pearce discusses the Inklings including Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, and Charles Williams as well as the role of Christian orthodoxy in their writings.  Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy presents a profoundly Catholic and Christian epic which has lent itself to many different allegorical interpretations.  Indeed, the role that a \\"true North\\" as opposed to a false \\"Protestant\\" North plays in Tolkien's work is fully explained by Pearce.  Finally, the fifth section of this book includes essays of a miscellaneous sort.  These include essays discussing the Decadent path to Christ through darkness and sin as well as discussions of Oscar Wilde.  Pearce argues that Wilde, who is perhaps most well known for the scandal that grew out of his homosexuality, had always had a profound love for the Catholic church leading to his eventual conversion towards the end of his life.  According to Pearce, Wilde has been misunderstood as a proponent of homosexual rights, instead of properly understood as a man who sought peace and regarded his homosexuality as a sickness.  Pearce also discusses Hollywood, both as a source of evil and as having the potential to do good, particularly noting the recent films _The Lord of the Rings_ and Mel Gibson's _The Passion of Christ_.  Pearce also discusses poetry, including both Dante and Shakespeare (both of whom may have been Catholics).  In addition, Pearce discusses the Catholicism and mystique of Salavador Dali, whose surreal paintings were underlain with Christian imagery.  Pearce ends by dedicating an essay to the late Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, by providing a biographical piece detailing his own conversion from a militant anti-Catholic to the faith, and by ending with an essay on the Christmas season. <br /> <br />This book presents an important contribution to the study of Catholic literature.  It provides not only an opportunity to study the faith through the works of some of this century's greatest writers, thinkers, and artists, but also with a unique selection of essays that enable one to see the true beauty that is the Catholic church.	2005-08-31

Lovecraft:  Tales_ made available through The Library of America is an excellent collection of 22 of Lovecraft's short stories.  H. P. Lovecraft was a writer of weird tales who defies description.  His stories incorporate elements of occult lore, science fiction, and cosmic terror with a writing style that is unique, though some have suggested overdone.  Lovecraft's tales show man faced up against the stark reality of a cosmos bereft of meaning (he was an atheist and materialist though he wrote on superstition), in which elder beings from other dimensions haunted the world of men.  Philosophically, Lovecraft was influenced by Nietzsche and Spengler whose philosophy of nihilistic decline he incorporated into his stories.  Lovecraft was also a racialist and arch-conservative (though he married a Jew and later came to advocate socialism) and expressed abhorrence for other races and immigrants within his stories.  Lovecraft was influenced by other writers such as Dunsany, Machen, and Poe, but also came to influence a new generation of weird tales writers including Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber, and Robert Bloch.  Throughout his stories several common elements occur, the presence of witchcraft in old New England towns, secret cults left over from bygone days, and occult writings which enable wizards to summon transdimensional beings.  Perhaps the best known of these occult writings is _The Necronomicon_, a tome invented by Lovecraft himself, said to be written by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.  Lovecraft had always been fascinated by Oriental lore since he was a child and entertained fantasies involving the _Arabian Nights_.  He took to calling himself this name after reading these tales.  Lovecraft developed a mythos in which various entities played the role of elder gods. <br /> <br />This book contains 22 stories written by Lovecraft.  These include: <br /> <br />\\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" (1919) <br /> <br />\\"The Outsider\\"(1921) <br /> <br />\\"The Music of Erich Zahn\\" (1922) <br /> <br />\\"Herbert West - Reanimator\\"  (1921-1922) <br /> <br />\\"The Lurking Fear\\"  (1922) <br /> <br />\\"The Rats in the Walls\\"  (1923) <br /> <br />\\"The Shunned House\\"  (1924) <br /> <br />\\"The Horror at Red Hook\\"  (1925) <br /> <br />\\"He\\"  (1925) <br /> <br />\\"Cool Air\\"  (1926) <br /> <br />\\"The Call of Cthulhu\\"  (1926) <br /> <br />\\"Pickman's Model\\"  (1926) <br /> <br />\\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\"  (1927) <br /> <br />\\"The Colour Out of Space\\"  (1927) <br /> <br />\\"The Dunwich Horror\\"  (1928) <br /> <br />\\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\"  (1930) <br /> <br />\\"At the Mountains of Madness\\"  (1931) <br /> <br />\\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\"  (1931) <br /> <br />\\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\"  (1932) <br /> <br />\\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\"  (1933) <br /> <br />\\"The Shadow Out of Time\\"  (1934-1935) <br /> <br />\\"The Haunter of the Dark\\"  (1935). <br /> <br />This book also includes a Chronology of Lovecraft's life as well as Notes accompanying the text.

This book _The Unabomber Manifesto:  Industrial Society and Its Future_ is the published version of the Unabomber's Manifesto made available by Jolly Roger Press.  In this manifesto, the man dubbed the Unabomber by the FBI (a noted murderer, now known to be Ted Kaczynski) writing under the name \\"FC\\" and claiming to belong to a larger organization gives his reasons for why he unleashed his terror upon the American people.  The chief aim of the Unabomber appears to have been a desire to overthrow \\"the system\\", i.e. industrial society, completely obliterating mankind's dependence on technology and restoring man to his rightful place within \\"wild nature\\".  Indeed, \\"FC\\" writes, \\"Never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine.\\"  Despite the fact that the Unabomber resorted to the most reprehensible and cowardly methods to achieve his aims, his manifesto is actually a thought provoking piece which attempts to shed light on modern man, his civilization, and its discontents.  Like the anarchist Luddites before him, the Old Order Amish, and radical environmentalists, Kaczynski perceived the fundamental problem brought about by technology, regarding it as a source of problems for modern man, and completely rejected the nave belief in \\"progress\\" and scientific rationalism.  Much of this book is spent explaining the psychology of defeatism and the process of oversocialization brought about by man's reliance upon \\"surrogate activities\\" to achieve realizable goals within the \\"power process\\".  Kaczynski provides one of the best critiques of leftism and political correctness available, showing how a psychology of defeatism arises among the upper strata of society causing them to experience excessive feelings of guilt resulting in their over-identification with the downtrodden, \\"minorities\\" (only the \\"respected\\" minorities, though), and the weak, all of whom they secretly despise.  The leftist is oversocialized and thus prone to moralistic preaching; however, they will seek means to vent their natural hostilities by taking them out on \\"society\\" and becoming rebellious.  Kaczynski also explains the power process, by which man comes to exert himself in order to attain a goal.  If either the exertion is insufficient and the goal comes too readily or the exertion occurs but the goal is not reached, then depression, demoralization, and defeatism may eventually result.  To rectify this situation, Kaczynski offers the insane suggestion that it is technology and \\"the system\\" which is to fault.  Kaczynski shows how science is being used to create machines which control every aspect of an individual's life - with particularly horrorific consequences involving the untamed science of genetic engineering.  Kaczynski also shows how \\"rules and regulations\\" result in the suppression of freedom, and how deprived of his freedom, man will become demoralized.  With each new technological advance comes another suppression of freedom.  Kaczynski's answer to these problems is revolution of the most violent kind.  His revolutionaries are to reject propaganda (marketing and advertising, which lead man along like an animal to slaughter) and opt instead for the individual and small communities.  In addition, they are to replace the ideal of progress with that of wild nature.  Nature may invoke religious or mystical feelings for many and thus provides a suitable rallying point for the coming revolution against technological society.  Further, his revolutionaries are to reject the leftist and collectivism as potential dangers.  Kaczynski shows how leftism leads to totalitarianism once the leftists gain power (the communist countries illustrate this perfectly, as well as modern day political correctness within the university system) and within leftism itself there is not suitable grounds for preventing this totalitarianism.  For Kaczynski, this revolution is man's only hope for reversing the Industrial Revolution and reclaiming man's natural place in the world again. <br /> <br />While Kaczynski's thoughts are certainly interesting, his methods are to be deplored.  Rather than waking man up from within, Kaczynski sought to achieve his ends through violence and resulted in many innocent deaths.  Also, his schemes are utopian in nature because no one has been alive long enough to remember what society was like before the Industrial Revolution.  While Kaczynski went out to live in the woods alone, his story may be contrasted with another individual who went out to live in the woods alone who had set out to accomplish his anarchist goals through much more admirable means; that is Thoreau.  Violence is not the answer! <br />	2005-08-22
US	50058656	R31N90NQOFV5GF	0823209822	439643697	Conservative Millenarians: The Romantic Experience in Bavaria	Books	5	4	6	N	N	German Romantic Millenarians.	_Conservative Millenarians:  The Romantic Experience in Bavaria_ by Paul Gottfried is an account of the various individuals in early nineteenth century Bavaria whose thinking may be described as conservative, romantic, and utopian.  These individuals were often part of a revival in Catholicism and expressed admiration for the Middle Ages and Christian mysticism.  They were utopian, yet reactionary, seeking to restore a lost past from which the modern age was believed to have fallen.  They may be described as counter-revolutionaries, opposing the French Revolution, defined by the Catholic traditionalist and reactionary Joseph de Maistre as \\"not a contrary revolution, but the contrary of revolution\\". <br /> <br />Gottfried begins his book by discussing the Catholic revival, the rise of millenarianism and romanticism.  Prime among the figures involved in the Catholic romantic revival include Novalis (pen name of Friedrich von Hardenberg, poet, scientist, and philosopher), Adam Muller (Protestant convert to Catholicism and romantic economic theorist advocating a corporativist state, based on medieval society), Friedrich Schlegel (expositor of romanticism, originally a radical individualist and admirer of the ancient Greeks, Indians, and other pagans who became a convert to Catholicism), Joseph von Gorres (early proponent of the revolution who grew disenchanted and became a defender of Catholicism), and Franz von Baader (romantic and social philosopher, a Catholic who was influenced by mysticism particularly the thought of the Lutheran apostate Jakob Boehme).  While these Catholic revolutionaries shared political ideals with such thinkers as Burke (the father of conservativism and opponent of revolution), Joseph de Maistre (reactionary traditionalist Catholic), and de Toqueville (Catholic writer on the \\"ancien regime\\" and opponent of democracy), they also were influenced heavily by mysticism and German idealism, including such mystics as Jakob Boehme, Jung-Stilling, Saint-Martin, and the Pietists. <br /> <br />Gottfried next turns his attention to the age of Montgelas, in which various laws were enacted which resulted in oppression for the church and clergy.  Here, Gottfried notes the influence of various rationalists, including the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt and the Rosicrucians, who plotted against throne and altar.  Weishaupt, a professor of canon law, created the Illuminati modeling his society after the Jesuits in 1776, actively conspiring to murder the king and adhering to rationalist beliefs.  Weishaupt along with Adolf von Knigge (a fellow Illuminatus) actively opposed other mystical doctrines such as those of the Swedenborgians and the Rosicrucians.  The Rosicrucians were another initiatory society, whose presence was revealed in the various manifestos which appeared at the time.  Believed to have been founded by Christian Rosenkreuz, the Rosicrucians were an invisible society of elite scientists and philosophers who would create a utopia.  The chief Rosicrucian manifesto to appear is believed to have been authored by the Lutheran minister Johann Valentin Andreae, who actively opposed the papacy and Catholic reaction.  Other individuals actively influenced by Rosicrucian mysticism, along with the writings of Paracelsus, include Karl von Eckarthausen and Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert whose book _The Symbolism of Dreams_ was to play an important role in the romantic movement.  Indeed, many romantics were especially influenced by Rosicrucianism as well as Martinism (the mysticism of Saint-Martin) and the Jewish Cabbala, though they often denied this influence.  The thought of Schelling, who although a Protestant was much admired by Catholics, also played a prominent part in the development of the romantic movement.  Throughout this discussion, Gottfried demonstrates the various conflicts which arose particularly between Catholics and Protestants as well as conflicts involving the Jews. <br /> <br />Another important component of the romantic movement was that of \\"the Awakening\\", a movement started by many Catholic parish priests who sought to imitate Protestant pietism within Catholicism but were also repulsed by Enlightenment rationalism.  Individuals involved in this movement included Johann Michael Sailer and Johann Ringseis, Catholic priests who sought an Awakening.  In the era of Ludwig I, Catholicism witnessed a revival and romantics led the way in propagating the faith.  In such journals as the _Athenaeum_, romantics actively sought the origins of human existence, often dabbling in non-Western religions, including the Vedas, as well as ancient Greek myth (arguing that the ancient Greeks were precursors of Christianity).  Romantics also exposited an eschatology in which a coming conflict with modernism would bring about the reign of Antichrist.  Romantics actively made war with both liberalism and modernism, advocating a corporativist medieval state as an alternative to class conflict.  For thinkers such as Muller and von Baader, the role of the worker played an important part in their economic theories.  Indeed, Gottfried notes the influence that romanticism may have played on the thought of early socialists including Karl Marx. <br />   <br />This book is an important source of information, providing much material on an otherwise neglected historical topic.  The conservative romantics, although frequently maligned because of baseless associations with the Third Reich, presented an important alternative to the decadence of modernity.  Their thinking will continue to live on in those who believe that traditional society is superior to the alternative of decadent modern civilization. <br />	2005-08-16
US	50058656	R339LGWLUIPU2T	0765800888	624392378	Democracy--The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order	Books	3	19	39	N	N	An Anarcho-Capitalist Manifesto.	_Democracy:  The God That Failed:  The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order_ by Hans-Hermann Hoppe is an extremely radical and revisionist book which argues that the state is by definition a priori unjust and therefore must be abolished allowing capitalism free reign.  So radical is this book that contrary to even extreme liberalism which advocates an ultra-minimal \\"night watchman\\" state to protect private property, here a complete private property anarchy is advocated (or \\"anarcho-capitalism\\") where private firms (insurance companies) compete to offer defense.   <br /> <br />Hoppe begins by tracing the development of government from monarchy to democracy (monarchy eventually being utterly defeated following World War I) and contrasting the Austrian experience to the American.  Hoppe argues that monarchy (a system in which the state is privately owned by a single individual) is more just than democracy (a system in which the state is publicly owned) because private ownership is always preferable to public ownership.  Hoppe echoes many of the classic conservative criticisms of democracy (democracy = tyranny of the majority, mob rule, etc.) while finding much admirable in monarchy (echoing such rightist thinkers as Erik von Kuehnelt-Liddehn, though moving away from Kuehnelt-Liddehn's critique of capitalism as itself constituting a \\"herdist instinct\\").  Then, following the Austrian proponents of radical laissez-faire and radicalizing the thought of Ludwig von Mises, Hoppe arrives at a defense of absolute property rights and advocates the abolition of the state (the state being defined as a territorial monopoly with the power to tax, and thus unjust) along lines first proposed by the radical liberal Gustave de Molinari in _The Production of Security_ and later advocated by libertarian rightist Murray Rothbard (a student of Mises).  Hoppe argues that taxation is theft, because the individual does not have the right to determine how his property is used and because democracy allows the masses to systematically redistribute wealth as well as leading to an increase in the size of government.  Hoppe also argues that private property rights imply a right to freely discriminate, and thus defends restrictions placed on foreign immigrants provided that free trade is allowed as well as the right to unlimited secession.  Hoppe argues against protectionism on the grounds that it actually lowers the standard of living and is unjust as is taxation.  Against the New World Order, Hoppe proposes an ideal of many localized freely associating communities bound together by free trade.  Hoppe also suggests that such a radical libertarian world will necessarily be a conservative one because private property is the fundamental institution behind conservativism.  Hoppe argues against leftist libertarians who believe that libertarianism implies a rejection of all authority but also against neoconservatives and Buchaninite populist conservatives (social nationalists), claiming that they merely represent the right wing of social democracy.  Hoppe also suggests that in an anarcho-capitalist world conflict and war would dwindle because insurance companies providing defense would refuse to insure aggressors.  Finally, Hoppe offers the prospect of revolution and voluntary withdrawal as the means to demolish the leviathanic state by means of unlimited secession, echoing the thought of La Boetie. <br /> <br />While I agree with Hoppe in his defense of monarchy, the right to secession (though not unlimited secession), and opposition to the New World Order and democracy, the problem is that he never presents arguments to show that property rights are absolute.  For instance, to echo the cry that \\"taxation is theft\\", there is the argument that \\"property is theft\\".  It is difficult to see how Hoppe's ideal would amount to anything more than a society in which the wealthy and cunning monopolized their power over the weak.  (While libertarians argue that a \\"natural monopoly\\" is just, it makes little practical difference whether the monopoly is \\"natural\\" or not, the restrictions it places on men's liberty is the same.)  Hoppe seems to believe that wealth is a virtue; however, the truth is that wealth is often acquired through dubious means and when wealth is acquired it frequently leads to a life of debauchery not virtue.  It seems difficult to see how the primary motivating force behind Hoppe's society would not be the sin Avaricia.  While socialism is most certainly motivated by envy and greed, so is capitalism.  Hoppe argues that complete private ownership would result in the restoration of \\"moral normalcy\\".  However, what kind of \\"moral normalcy\\" is it when libertarians admit that abortion and suicide would become a \\"private\\" matter (i.e. murder becomes a private matter in which justice is sought by truckling up to the wealthy) and children have the unlimited right to \\"secede\\" from their parents?  It is for these reasons that the conservative cannot believe in anarcho-capitalism.  Rather, the true conservative must support an integrated, organic state.  The ideal of the wild West is no longer possible because the frontier is gone, the population has increased, and the Industrial Revolution has occurred.  As a Christian, I believe that all earthly governments are evil.  However, given the choice between an organic, unified state and an anarcho-capitalist plutocracy, I must choose the organic state as being more Christian.  While democracy is certainly a great evil, we must return to a natural aristocracy of virtue and wisdom (and not an aristocracy of wealth and acquisitiveness, not synonymous).   <br /> <br />Finally, there is the matter of hypocrisy.  Hoppe works for and presumably accepts pay from a publicly funded institution.  He certainly has not withdrawn from the influence of the state as he advocates.          <br />	2005-08-11
US	50058656	R36064JWR51K0Q	0399500359	832862780	The Black Arts: A Concise History of Witchcraft, Demonology, Astrology, and Other Mystical Practices Throughout the Ages (Perigee)	Books	5	64	70	N	N	The Black Magical Arts.	_The Black Arts_ by Richard Cavendish covers a great many topics dealing with the magical arts, particularly black magic.  According to Cavendish, the primary motivating factor behind black magic is the hunger for power.  This is expressed in the biblical story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis where the serpent tempts Adam and Eve by telling them that if they ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they would be as gods.  The traditional Christian perspective is that the black magician invokes demons or Satan himself and that his power comes from the Dark One.  The magician however may believe that man and God are inseparable or that man can attain Godhood.  The author begins by noting how magical principles operate, being based on the ideas of imitation, mimickry, and analogy.  One fundamental principle believed in by most magicians is expressed by the phrase \\"as above, so below\\" meaning that the macrocosm is a reflection of the microcosm and vice versa.  Indeed, it is in the writings attributed to the semi-mythical Hermes Trismegistus (\\"thrice-greatest Hermes\\") that this principle is most clearly expressed.  In most traditional cultures, the left hand side is associated with evil, explaining why black magic is often regarded as the Left Hand Path among magicians.  Cavendish next turns his attention to the modern magicians, including such figures as the notorious Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Levi, MacGregor Mathers, and A. E. Waite.  The influence of secret societies such as the Golden Dawn and the O. T. O. of Crowley are explained and their role in the practices of these magicians is examined.  Following this, Cavendish turns his attention to the mysteries of numbers and numerology.  He explains how fortunes can be told by numbers associated with each letter in a name.  The numbers 1 through 9 are given special meanings, along with the numbers 11 and 22.  Cavendish also explains how numerology relates to cabbalism and the Tarot cards.  Among the Hebrews, the practice of gematria, or assigning a number to each letter of a word, was common.  This has been used to interpret various biblical passages.  Cavendish also explains the \\"names of power\\", used by the magician to invoke spirits or to perform other magical rites.  It was believed that a name holds special power over an entity, and the names of God, angels, and demons were especially powerful.  The name of God was given to Moses in the Bible and is abbreviated as the four letter combination YHWH or the Tetragrammaton.  But, some have suggested that God has a secret name which is not known (or even that the pronunciation of this secret name backwards may bring about the end of the world, or corresponds to the name of the Devil).  The names of Jesus and Christ was also highly regarded by magicians.  Cavendish next turns his attention to alchemy, including the making of the philosopher's stone, the turning of base metals such as lead into gold, and the search for the elixir of life.  But, alchemy also had a more noble, spiritual purpose and the conversion of base metals into gold may be an allegory for the inner spiritual transformation of the alchemist.  Following this, Cavendish discusses astrology (including natal astrology, mundane astrology, and astrology as applied to special events).  Astrology is linked to numerology in many important ways, and each of the signs of the zodiac has a special interpretation.  Cavendish next turns his attention to ritual magic.  Here, he discusses the preparation of the magic circle, through which spirits cannot enter.  He also discusses animal (and often human) sacrifice as a means to invoke spirits (or demons).  The magician engages in a complicated rite which may involve various objects as well as the drawing of a pentagram or the Seal of Solomon in order to summon a spirit or demon to do his bidding.  While performing this rite, the magician must remain within the magic circle at all times so that the entity called forth cannot interfere.  Cavendish also discusses \\"the Lords of Darkness\\", the names of various demons which appear in various grimoires are often used by the magician to do his bidding.  In addition, Cavendish mentions the practice of necromancy, in which the magician attempts to make contact with the dead, as well as the use of corpses and the creation of zombies in certain magical rites.  Finally, Cavendish discusses \\"low magic\\" including the mandrake and various love spells.  While the magician seeks to have demons and evil spirits do his bidding, the Satanist becomes servant of the Devil and does the bidding of his Dark Lord.  Cavendish begins by discussing the origins of Satan in both the Old and New Testaments, including ancient Jewish tradition.  Satan originally meant an \\"accuser\\", and his revolt against God may have been motivated by pride.  Cavendish also mentions \\"the Watchers\\" from the Book of Enoch, who mated with the daughters of men and may have fallen because of their lust.  Cavendish discusses Satanism, the outright rejection of God the Father and worship of Satan, as well as various heresies that arose out of Gnosticism.  Cavendish next discusses witchcraft, distinguishing between scholars who believe that witchcraft actually existed in medieval Europe (including Margaret Murray who argued that witches represented a surviving pagan cult, and Montague Summers who argued that witches worshipped Satan) and those who rejected the reality of witchcraft.  Cavendish explains the witches' Sabbat, the appearance of Satan to the witches in the form of a man or an animal such as a cat, a dog , or a goat, and the making of a pact with Satan.  Cavendish also discusses the various magical uses to which the Roman Catholic mass has been put.  He notes also the reality of the black mass, an attempt by Satanists to ape Christ, often involving orgies and human sacrifice.  While much in this book should be taken with extreme caution, it offers a well-researched understanding of various magical practices throughout the ages.	2005-08-06
US	50058656	R34M9F7QUWIL51	0760701172	270742346	The Rosicrucian Enlightenment	Books	5	20	20	N	N	The Rise of Rosicrucianism.	_The Rosicrucian Enlightenment_ by Renaissance scholar Frances Yates is a fascinating account of the Rosicrucian movement in seventeenth century Europe and its relationship to various political intrigues of the time.  Yates begins by remarking that in referring to Rosicrucians she is not referring to any of the modern day occult groups which go under this name and by referring to \\"enlightenment\\" she is not referring to the historical period known as the \\"Aufklarung\\" in which philosophers attempted to shed light on the darkness of superstition.  Rather, Yates suggests that certain documents referred to as the \\"Rosicrucian manifestos\\" published in seventeenth century Germany brought about an enlightenment in which other intellectuals attempted to copy from them and incorporate elements of Rosicruicianism into their utopias.  The word Rosicrucian refers at once to the semi-mythical (at least believed to be mythical by most modern scholars) hero of the manifestos Christian Rosencreutz but also to the Rosy Cross (combining \\"Rose + Cross\\" or perhaps \\"Ros\\" (dew) and \\"Crux\\" in an alchemical interpretation).  Yates emphasizes two aspects of the Rosicrucian movement.  First, she wants to ground this movement in the Hermetic philosophy, cabbalism, and magical traditions of the Renaissance (emphasizing her earlier studies on such Renaissance figures as Giordano Bruno and Marsilio Ficino).  Second, she wants to emphasize the influence of  the Elizabethan magus John Dee on Rosicrucianism. <br /> <br />Yates begins by describing a \\"royal wedding\\" between Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V, Elector Palatine of the Rhine.  These two became known mockingly as \\"the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia\\" after Frederick's failed attempt to take the throne of Bohemia and their flight from Prague.  Their union was supposed to represent a Protestant front against Hapsburg aggression and the forces of Catholic reaction.  Yates shows the influence of Shakespeare and the theater on the pair as well as Spenser who wrote the _Faerie Queene_.  It was at around this time that three Rosicrucian manifestos appeared.  These include two pamphlets which first appeared in 1614 and 1615 with abbreviated titles of the _Fama_ and the _Confessio_ and a third publication appearing in 1616, an alchemical romance with the title _The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz_.  This last romance is believed to have been written by Johann Valentin Andreae, a Lutheran pastor with socialist interests.  These writings inform the reader of an invisible and hidden society of Rosicrucians founded by Christian Rosencreutz and explain his exploits and adventures as well as delving into alchemical symbolism.  Yates suggests that they express political support for \\"the Winter King and Queen\\". <br /> <br />Yates argues that one of the most important figures to play some role in the development of the Rosicrucian movement is that of John Dee.  Dee, a learned magus well versed in mathematics, numerology, and science, was an important figure in Elizabethan England; however, as Yates suggests he came to influence the Rosicrucian movement when he visited Germany, Bohemia, and Prague.  Indeed, the Rosicrucian manifestos, which praise science and rationality are developed along some of the same lines as Dee's writings.  Other important figures involved in the Rosicrucian movement, though denying their Rosicrucianism, include Robert Fludd and Michael Maier, both of whom expressed in alchemical writings cabalistic principles as well as the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm.  Rosicrucianism created a furore in Germany and also spread to France where it created a scare among the populace.  Rosicrucians at first were believed to be linked to the Jesuits; however, given the antipapist sentiment expressed by the Rosicrucians in their manifestos they were soon taken to be enemies of the Jesuits by counter-reformation thinkers.  Cartesian philosophy and the thought of Francis Bacon were alsotaken to be linked with the Rosicrucians.  Rosicrucianism emphasized science and regarded the discovery of two new stars as a beacon in the sky which mirrored the coming age of enlightenment.  Another figure associated with Rosicrucianism is that of Elias Ashmole, the chief representative of the alchemical movement in England who copied the manifestos.  Eventually Andreae came to move away from Rosicrucianism, advocating instead Christian unions as part of his utopian \\"Christianopolis\\".  However, these unions were motivated by the same basic underlying philosophy as the Rosicrucian manifestos.  Others who wrote utopias based on these manifestos include Campenella in Italy and Comenius.  Some have maintained that the founding of the Royal Society, a society of scientists and mathematicians, in England serves as the instantiation of the \\"invisible brotherhood\\".  Even Isaac Newton has been regarded as influenced by Rosicrucianism.  In addition, Rosicrucianism came to influence freemasonry, which incorporated Rosicrucian elements into its grades. <br /> <br />This book serves as an excellent introduction to the Rosicrucian movement in the seventeenth century.  Yates is indebted to A. E. Waite whose book on the subject proved useful to her; however, she notes the problematic parts in his book.  Yates also details much of the political intrigue surrounding this movement.  This book includes an appendix which features the two Rosicrucian manifestos in full:  the _Fama_ and the _Confessio_.   <br />	2005-08-02

Montague Summers, a convert to Catholicism, was an eccentric character - a priest who operated independently in England and wrote much on the occult and folklore from the perspective of a medieval traditionalist Roman Catholic.  Summers argues against the so-called rationalists and skeptics who refuse to recognize the existence of the supernatural or the role of evil and of Satan in the world.  Against these and other modernists, Summers provides the traditional Roman Catholic view regarding the demonic nature of heresy and the role of Satan in its proliferation. <br /> <br />According to Summers, the witch is at once \\"heretic and anarchist\\".  He seeks to show how all heresy, beginning with the dualistic Gnostic heresy including Manicheeism, is rooted in satanism and attempts to supplant the godly order of society and makes war against Christ and his Catholic Church.  Among other heresies mentioned by Summers are those of the Waldensians, the Adamites, and the Cainites - Gnostics who spurned Christ and opted instead for the worship of Satan making an effort to identify with the sources of evil in Holy Scripture such as Cain and Judas Iscariot.  Summers also mentions the Templars who became corrupted and engaged in vile acts including the worship of a human head known as the Baphomet.  The witch, a devotee of Satan, may be understood as a revival of these most ancient and heinous heresies.  Summers argues for the reality of witchcraft, claiming that there really existed a conspiracy against medieval society represented in witchcraft and that that conspiracy involved the worship of Satan, against the rationalists who attempt to explain it away through other means.  Summers also argues against the theories of Margaret Murray, an anthropologist and Egyptologist who in her (in)famous book _The Witch-Cult in Western Europe_ argued that witchcraft represented a surviving pre-Christian pagan religion of Dianic worship which underlay medieval Christian society.  Summers attempts to outline various features of the witch including the role of various demons and familiars, the witch's mark (believed to be an imprint left from the claw of Satan, and explaining the role of the \\"witch pricker\\"), the presence of a tiny nipple on the witch's body through which the familiar often in the form of a cat was nourished, and the role of the witch's sabbat.  Summers also shows how the witch as Satanist sought to ape the Church of Christ, desecrate the host and religious objects, and engage in the black mass.  Among others, Summers makes reference to such notorious criminals as Gilles de Rais (who engaged in the murder of children - another frequent accusation made against the witch) and the author J. K. Huysmans (whose novels feature Satanism and the black mass).  Summers also turns his attention to the witch in Holy Writ.  Here, he mentions the witch of Endor as well as bringing up such infamous injunctions against witchcraft as that in the Old Testament Exodus 22:18 \\"Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live.\\"  In addition, Summers attempts to fully explain the phenomenon of diabolical possession.  First, he notes the reality of diabolical possession and then he presents a discussion of the exorcism.  Throughout he makes reference to Scripture, noting the exorcisms done by Christ himself and the apostles as well as from the history of the church and the lives of the saints.  While the reality of the diabolical possession among those exorcised by Christ is de fide, some have argued that other exorcisms are more suspect (and others outside of the Catholic faith including Anglicans and other Protestants have rejected the practice entirely).  Summers shows the errors in these rationalist and modernist explanations, and although it is possible that many were not in fact possessed, it is certainly the case that a great many were.  In addition, Summers presents the entire Roman Ritual for exorcism.  Summers also shows the use of exorcism among the Puritans, who often amateurishly attempted to copy the attempts of various Jesuits.  Summers also explains spiritism (or spiritualism) in which a medium attempts to make contact with the dead or other discarnate spirits through various means.  Summers shows the dangers of this and other occult beliefs presenting official documents from various church councils and popes.  The church (and Summers) believe that much in spiritism can be explained as simply fraudulent practice; however, the fact remains that there is something diabolical at root behind spiritism and that often the spirits encountered in fact represent demons.  Finally, Summers ends with a discussion of the witch in dramatic literature.  Here, he presents details from various plays involving witchcraft including such famous examples as that of the Faust legend (presented in Goethe's _Faust_ and Marlowe's _Dr. Faustus_, for example) and in Shakespeare (especially the witches in _Macbeth_), etc.   <br /> <br />This book represents one of the best available on the history of witchcraft.  Summers is obviously very learned and presents many obscure references, often in their original form (archaic English, French, Latin, or Greek), as well as stories from the lives of the saints, the history of the church, and Holy Scripture.  Summers is unequivocally unapologetic for his rejection of modernism and thoroughly embraces the medieval viewpoint.  He remains a fascinating and eccentric character whose books provide details on the occult of an encyclopedic scope.   <br />	2005-07-30

This book develops along the same lines as Cohn's previous book _The Pursuit of the Millenium_ which also deals with the dark underside of European history.  This book attempts to trace the roots of demonization from the early period when the Romans demonized first Jews and then Christians, followed by the subsequent rise of Christianity and the theological development of the concept of Satan and his demons, followed by the demonization of various medieval heretics, followed by the crushing of the Knights Templar, followed by the rise of ritual magic and various demon-worshipping magicians, and eventually culminating in the great witch-hunt. <br /> <br />Cohn begins by noting the prelude to the subsequent persecutions of Christians in antiquity.  As the inheritors of the Jewish tradition, ancient Christians were often accused by the Romans of some of the same crimes as the Jews had been.  These included allegations of worshipping an ass-headed god in the form of the crucified (just as the Jews had also been accused of worshipping an ass), cannibalism (particularly the eating of babies) which may have resulted from a distorted representation of the eucharist, and participation in wild orgies, sexual promiscuity including incest.  In addition, the early Christians were believed to be plotting against Roman society and this led to their persecution by the Romans.  Later when the Christians were to come to take control of the Roman empire these same fears and beliefs were to continue to arise again and again. <br /> <br />Cohn next turns his attention to the theological development of the concept of Satan and his demons.  In particular, Satan came to play a very prominent role in the development of Jewish and early Christian apocalyptic literature.  Later demons were seen to represent various vices and tempted monks, priests, nuns, as well as the common people. <br /> <br />Following this, Cohn explains the process by which medieval heretics were demonized.  Heretical groups such as the Waldensians and the Fraticelli were believed to engage in promiscuous orgies as well as cannibalism by many in the church.  Cohn explains this process of demonization by which heretical groups were believed to be in contact with demons or Satan himself. <br /> <br />The Knights Templar represent a particularly interesting and disturbing aspect of medieval European history.  This group became powerful after their involvement in the crusades and developed into wealthy bankers.  It may have been their influence in the political realm and as bankers which led to their subsequent demise.  They were put on trial in which they were accused of engaging in various blasphemies including spitting on the cross, sodomy with their brothers, denying Christ, and worshipping a head known as the Baphomet (perhaps reminiscent of Mohammed, in one theory). <br /> <br />Cohn next turns his attention to the rise of ritual magic and the worship of demons by various magicians to achieve material gain and worldly power.  Among others, Pope Boniface VIII was tried posthumously for allegedly making contact with demons and wearing a mysterious ring (which may have been a ring dedicated to Jupiter).  Magicians were believed to invoke demons to achieve various diabolical ends, including personal revenge and gaining wordly power. <br /> <br />Finally, Cohn provides his theory of the development of the great witch-hunt.  Cohn argues against such theories as those presented by Margaret Murray in her _The Witch-Cult of Western Europe_, in which she argued that witches practiced a surviving pagan cult with possible links to ancient Egypt, and those of the Roman Catholic priest Montague Summers, who had argued that witchcraft consisted of worshipping the devil.In my opinion, Cohn gives these rather interesting theories short shrift and refuses to recognize the reality of witchcraft.  Cohn argues that there was no society of witches, but his arguments seem just as unlikely as those which suggest that there indeed was.  While it is true that most of those burnt as witches were likely innocents, it nevertheless seems entirely probable that there did exist a medieval secret society which worshipped the Christian devil and which sought to destroy the underpinnings of the medieval world. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this book provides a fascinating account of some of the darker aspects of European history including many senseless persecutions.   <br />	2005-07-18
US	50058656	RUQ8LP8X76K94	0812974417	427020672	At the Mountains of Madness: The Definitive Edition (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	16	24	N	N	A Maddening Tale of Lovecraftian Cosmic Terror.	\\"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\\"  -  H. P. Lovecraft. <br /> <br />_At the Mountains of Madness:  The Definitive Edition_ republished by The Modern Library Classics contains three principle parts:  a short introduction to H. P. Lovecraft and the story by China Mieville, the story \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" by H. P. Lovecraft, and Lovecraft's essay \\"Supernatural Horror in Fiction\\".  H. P. Lovecraft was an eccentric writer of weird fiction whose bizarre horror stories continue to both fascinate and repel.  Lovecraft himself was a man of contradictions, an avowed materialist and atheist who wrote on superstition, the occult, and the supernatural, an aristocratic ultra-conservative who eventually embraced socialism, a racialist and elitist who found other races, miscegenation, and immigrants abhorrent, yet who married a Jew, and an ardent follower of the theories of Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler regarding \\"the decline of the West\\".  As China Mieville notes in his introduction, his tale \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" reveals many of these elements. <br /> <br />\\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" first published in 1931 is the tale of several scientific explorers who are visiting Antarctica.  Lovecraft long harbored a fascination with this southernmost continent, and this tale reveals his scientific knowledge regarding geology, climatology, and paleontology.  While exploring Antarctica, the scientists discover the remains of vaguely amphibious creatures which cause them to conjure up memories of various occult texts including the dread _Necronomicon_ and weird tales penned by authors such as Clark Ashton Smith, Lovecraft's good friend.  The _Necronomicon_ by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazared is entirely an invention of Lovecraft's which first appeared in his tale \\"The Hound\\".  The explorers also encounter the ruins of a lost civilization, where they find the remains of \\"the Old Ones\\".  As China Mieville explains in his preface, Lovecraft reveals the influence of Spengler here, whose _Decline of the West_ showed how civilizations entered a stage of decline.  While there, they also encounter certain monstrous penguin creatures and a slave race of shoggoths.  Lovecraft who feared the rise of the masses regarded the shoggoths, a race of slave-like creatures of \\"the Old Ones\\" as the ultimate abomination.  Lovecraft's paranoia of other races was particularly intense and led to his creation of stories of nihilistic cosmic horror.  While many find this paranoia repulsive, few will disagree that it provides his stories with an edge that makes them unique in all of literature.  This tale was obviously influenced by Edgar Allen Poe, who Lovecraft very much admired, whose _The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym_ also featured a mythicized southern pole and provided the maddening sound heard by the explorers \\"Tekeli-li\\". <br /> <br />\\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" is Lovecraft's essay outlining the history of supernatural and weird fiction and showing the influences on his own fiction and thought.  I am particularly grateful that this essay was included in this edition, because it provides a fascinating overview of the literature which served as the primary inspiration for Lovecraft's own fiction.  In this essay, Lovecraft who was an avowed materialist begins by explaining how fear and superstition play an important role in the life and history of man.  He notes the primitive cults and religions which incorporated supernatural elements in their beliefs.  Lovecraft next turns his attention to \\"The Dawn of the Horror-Tale\\".  Here, he explains the various sources of the horror tale in folklore and magic as well as medieval literature.  Next, Lovecraft writes of the development of these elements into \\"The Early Gothic Novel\\".  Here, he mentions the novels of such famous Gothic writers as Horace Walpole and Ann Radcliffe whose stories provided the basis for Gothic novels.  Lovecraft also writes of the apex and the aftermath of Gothic fiction, as the form developed and finally collapsed upon itself.  Next, Lovecraft turns to \\"Spectral Literature on the Continent\\", where he outlines some of the European ghost stories.  Lovecraft devotes a separate section on the master Edgar Allen Poe, whose fiction played such an important role in the formation of Lovecraft's own.  According to Lovecraft, Poe was the fist to realize that a more objective view of the characters provided the horror tale with greater appeal.  Lovecraft next turns his attention to \\"The Weird Tradition in America\\", noting the influence of writers such as Washington Irving and Nathaniel Hawthorne.  The influence of the puritans in America and the witch trials that occurred in the colonial days provides much inspiration for the writings of weird tales, and in particular for Lovecraft's own stories.  Lovecraft next turns his attention to \\"The Weird Tradition in the British Isles\\", where he notes the influence of Celtic folklore and the Irish ghost story.  Finally, Lovecraft turns his attention to \\"The Modern Masters\\", these are the writers who influenced him to the greatest extent.  The writers that Lovecraft includes in this category are Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and Montague Rhodes James.  William Hope Hodgson was also to have a great influence on Lovecraft, which he notes in his section on the British writers.  This essay provides a fascinating look at the source of much of Lovecraft's fiction, the tradition of supernatural horror. <br /> <br />Lovecraft's weird tales continue to fascinate and disturb the modern reader.  This book provides an excellent edition of one of those tales as well as an important essay of his which reveals the influences on his stories. <br />	2005-07-09

Books	5	12	13	N	N	The Ideology of Corporatism.	_Corporatism and Comparative Politics:  The Other Great \\"Ism\\"_ by social scientist Howard J. Wiarda is an introduction to the political philosophy of corporatism (the other great \\"ism\\").  Corporatism is distinct from both liberalism and Marxism and serves as an important framework or model by which to understand certain governments and societies.  Corporatism connotes a system in which major societal groups - for example, clan, ethnic, religious, economic, or military groups - are integrated into the governmental system for the purpose of achieving coordinated national development.  While corporatism has proven problematic for many, given its role in various oppressive regimes in the earlier half of the twentieth century, it remains a distinct political system. <br /> <br />This book begins by contrasting corporatism to both Marxism and liberalism (pluralism).  Under liberalism there is a weak state with strong interest groups independent of the state.  Under corporatism there is a strong directing state with structured and limited pluralism of interest groups.  Under Marxism, Leninism, or fascism there is a total state with weak, totally controlled interest groups.  This spectrum provides a useful guidepost by which to understand the corporatist phenomenon.  The author also notes that corporatism has four distinct forms which it may come to take.  These are historical or \\"natural\\" corporatism, ideological corporatism, manifest corporatism, and modern neo-corporatism.  Historical or \\"natural\\" corporatism occurs in many premodern societies that are founded on traditions emphasizing solidarity, group identity, and community.  These include the ethnic, clan, and tribal basis of African politics, many of the Confucian based societies of East Asia, the group, clan, and caste based societies of South Asia, and those societies based in the tradition involving the Koran.  In Western Europe, a corporatist system existed before the onslaught of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution which included military orders, guilds, the Roman Catholic Church and its orders, and the aristocracy.  With the emphasis on the individual and on individual rights brought about by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, many came to regret the coming breakup of the old order.  This led many conservatives and especially Catholics to create an ideology that they called corporatism based on a radical nostalgia.  In the papal encyclicals, _Quadregessimo Anno_ and _Rerum Novarum_ a religious based system of corporatism was outlined.  Other forms of corporatism were more secular in nature.  Some were authoritarian and others were more democratic.  Manifest corporatism involved various regimes including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Vichy France, Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, Metaxas's Greece, Dolfuss's Austria, Vargas's Brazil, and Peron's Argentina in the earlier half of the twentieth century.  Many of these regimes were authoritarian and involved severe human rights abuses leading many to perceive corporatism in a highly negative light.  Later regimes which came to involve corporatism would reject the corporatist label despite their adherence to this ideology because of the negative connotations that became associated with the word due to the fascist regimes which operated under its principles.  Modern neo-corporatism is distinct from these authoritarian regimes and tends to be more democratic and pluralistic in character.  Corporatism has proven to be a particularly useful model for understanding various regimes in Latin America, as well as neo-corporatism in Europe.  The United States has a long tradition emphasizing individualism and individual initiative making corporatism a shunned phenomenon in the U.S.  However, as the author shows the United States is exhibiting a creeping form of corporatism with the rise of F. D. R.'s New Deal and the subsequent welfare state.  Many critics remain firmly opposed to corporatism, given the bad name and associations it has been given but also based on ideological reasons of their own.  Marxists for example have long regarded corporatism as a right wing phenomenon and a tool of the capitalist class to appease the proletariat.  Indeed, Trotsky was once called a \\"corporatist\\" by Stalin in an effort to discredit him.  Classical liberals such as Margaret Thatcher have been long outstanding opponents of corporatism.  While the rise of corporatism in the United States may be troubling for some, it remains a distinct phenomenon of interest. <br /> <br />This book provides an excellent introduction to the ideological phenomenon of corporatism.  The author explains many of the key points regarding this particular political form. While corporatism remains distinct from both Marxism and liberalism as a third ideology of modern political and social organization, it is important to understand this phenomenon if one wants to understand many of the political regimes throughout the world. <br />	2005-07-09

Dennis argues that to face the challenges of the space age it has become necessary to concern oneself with the very prospects of the survival of civilization.  With the arrival of global warfare and the use of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the very issue of survival becomes imminent given the possibility of extinction brought about by nuclear war.  Dennis offers what he calls \\"operational thinking\\", focussing upon the how and not the what of the major problems of domestic and international import, as the only way to arrive at solutions to the modern crisis.  Dennis notes that survival comes before hopes for reform or progress, indeed it is the very issue that faces modern man. <br /> <br />In this book, Dennis identifies four main challenges for the Twentieth century.  These are the challenge of underconsumption, which results in mass unemployment, the challenge of war, resorted to as the only practical means of keeping total consumption high enough for full employment, the challenge of the world-wide revolt of the masses identified by theorists such as Ortega y Gassett in his book _The Revolt of the Masses_ and Lothrop Stoddard in his book _The Rising Tide of Color_, and the challenge of population increase.  To meet these challenges and to ensure survival it is necessary to think about them operationally.  Dennis, who opposed the entry of the United States into the Second World War and was subsequently tried for sedition, recognizes the great evil that modern warfare is.  Dennis explains that those who support interventionist wars are unwittingly inviting socialism into the United States.  Dennis also questions the current debt based economic system, recognizing the great evil and challenge of a growing nationaldebt.  He writes that facing the challenges posed by war and communism is the most important problem for the modern world. <br /> <br />_Operational Thinking for Survival_ is one of Dennis' later books, which brings up many of the same issues which he attempted to face in his early books and in his other political writings.  Dennis remains a problematic individual for many, given his opposition to war and to the capitalist debt based economic system.  However, his thinking remains unique and important among those forgotten political theorists who attempted to find viable alternatives for the world in which we have come to live.  This book recognizes the great challenges faced by modern man and the need to approach those challenges in an operational way, because the very survival of civilization is at stake. <br />	2005-07-04

Radosh, who originally began his career as a sort of libertarian socialist and later moved to the right, wrote this book under the guidance of such Old Right libertarians as Murray Rothbard.  The thinkers whose profiles appear in this book offered criticism of American interventionism, beginning with the American intervention in the First and Second World Wars and culminating in the Cold War, as well as of the creeping influence of the state that interventionism brought.  These thinkers include the Progressive historian Charles A. Beard, the editor-journalist of the liberal _Nation_ Oswald Garrison Villard, the noted titular head of the Republican party (\\"Mr. Republican\\") Senator Robert A. Taft, the economist and writer John T. Flynn, and the self proclaimed intellectual \\"fascist\\" Lawrence Dennis.  Against the smears of \\"isolationist\\" these critics challenged the interventionist foreign policies of such politicians as Woodrow Wilson, F. D. R., and Harry Truman.  They called into question America's role in foreign wars which did not concern its direct national interest.  And, they often did so at great personal loss. <br /> <br />Charles A. Beard began as a Progressive historian whose writings on the Constitution of the United States challenged accepted belief.  He came to challenge the foreign policy of Wilson and Roosevelt advocating neutrality.  With the entry of the United States into the Second World War, Beard became a revisionist, attempting to show how F. D. R. had provoked the attack upon Pearl Harbor to cause the United States to enter the war.  He was treated harshly by his contemporaries and by later historians for his \\"isolationist\\" stance. <br /> <br />Oswald Garrison Villard was an editor and journalist for the _Nation_ who originally advocated anti-imperialism, pacifism, and the liberal doctrine of laissez-faire economics.  He was related to abolitionists and he too would come to favor civil rights for blacks as well as women's suffrage.  Later, Villard was to come to change his laissez-faire economic positions somewhat, but for his opposition to F. D. R. and to America's entry into World War II he was removed as a writer for the _Nation_.  Villard later came to join the America First committee which advocated an anti-interventionist policy.  He also later was to become a critic of the Cold War with Russia and opposed the anti-communist hysteria which led to investigation of Hollywood screenwriters. <br /> <br />Robert A. Taft came from an old political family and had the reputation for being a dogmatic \\"isolationist\\".  He led the Republican opposition to F. D. R.'s interventionist policies in the Second World War.  Taft was vehemently anti-communist and noted that \\"the victory of communism in the world outside of America would be far more dangerous to the United States from an ideological standpoint than the victory of fascism\\".  Taft came to challenge the Nuremberg tribunal as well as supporting Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade.  However, Taft also came to oppose the Cold War believing that Chinese communism was more militaristic than Soviet communism. <br /> <br />John T. Flynn began as a liberal or radical in economic matters, seeking to find an answer to the curse of bigness in industry.  However, Flynn moved to the right advocating a non-interventionist policy in the Second World War.  He also came to campaign actively on behalf of the America First Committee.  Flynn along with Charles A. Lindbergh were frequently smeared as \\"anti-semites\\" or \\"fascists\\" because of the presence of certain rather unsavory elements within the committee.  Later Flynn came to embrace McCarthyism and anti-communism though he remained opposed to the Cold War arguing the Soviet military did not pose the threat it was believed to.  This led him into conflict with William F. Buckley when he submitted an article to the _National Review_. <br /> <br />Lawrence Dennis remains a problematic figure for many given his open avowal of fascism as a form of socialism.  Dennis began as a capitalist interventionist who later came to see the problems with capitalism and war and developed his own belief in a coming American fascism.  The use of the word fascism by Dennis led him into difficulties, particularly with many communists who saw him as a fomenter of anti-semitism and racism despite the fact that his books included none of this.  Dennis argued that in trying to overcome fascism and entering the Second World War, the United States would go fascist itself, leading to his opposition to entry into war and F. D. R.'s policies.  Later Dennis came to abandon some of his early socialist beliefs advocating a form of laissez-faire but remaining opposed to bigness as well as foreign intervention.  He remained firmly opposed to the Cold War as well as an opponent of McCarthy, probably because he himself had been tried for sedition during the Second World War. <br /> <br />This book reveals some of the neglected thinkers of the American Old Right who opposed foreign intervention, the new world order, and global war.  While today the Right has been largely taken over by neoconservatives who advocate interventionism, these thinkers represent an older Right which resolutely opposed the senseless entry of the United States into wars which did not concern its direct national interest. <br />	2005-07-04

The enigmatic and forgotten Lawrence Dennis offered one a unique understanding of politics and economics for a world faced with the crisis of war.  Although Dennis did not use the term, his politics may be thought of as populist, the unique American political tradition which offered resistance to the excesses of capitalism and the evils of communism, a nationalist and not an internationalist foreign policy, and opposition to the New World Order schemes of the elite.  Populism and the thinking of Dennis may be understand as a \\"middle way\\" between those of socialism and unrestrained capitalism.<br /><br />On the eve of war, Dennis who opposed the entry of the United States into the Second World War, asks several disturbing questions about the nature of capitalism.  In particular, he questions whether the current system of liberalism plus democracy can handle depression and adequately deal with the problems of underconsumption and unemployment.  With the current system, it becomes necessary to get rid of excess production, either by adopting socialism or through war.  With the loss of the frontier and with the current system of debt, Dennis believed that planning became a necessity.  The form of planning Dennis offered as an alternative to socialism is that of fascism.  Dennis devotes a good deal of space to arguing against the current debt system and the practice of usury.  Indeed, the Catholic church had long condemned usury as a great evil until the industrial period.  Indeed, Aristotle, Jesus, and Moses all condemned the practice of money-lending and it was not until Calvin, the theologian of the shopkeepers, that usury became an accepted practice among Christians.  Dennis also points to the distinction between an absolute state as understood by liberalism and an absolute state as understood by fascism.  Those who believe in liberalism fail to understand that even in the current system the power of the state is absolute.  As part of his proposal, Dennis suggests that the market must be enlarged and that social control must be achieved.  To obtain these ends, it is necessary to create a good citizenry and for the elite to assume responsibility.  It is the out-elite who will most likely find resonance with this suggestion.  Dennis also includes a discussion on the role of women under the coming fascism.  While it is argued by many feminists that women will be denied their rights under the coming system, Dennis believes this not to be the case, recognizing legitimate differences between the sexes.  In addition, Dennis proposes a nationalist foreign policy as opposed to an internationalist policy.  Dennis strongly objected to the involvement of the United States in the Second World War and was subsequently put on trial for treason.  Dennis also offers some remarks about the formation of the fascist party, which he believed likely to come to power in America.<br /><br />While the arguments presented by Dennis remain sound, his thinking came to change slightly after the subsequent entry of the United States into the war.  For example, he came to recognize the role of foreign aid as a means for ridding the system of excess production by the capitalists.  He also came to realize the real danger that war posed for the survival of mankind, especially in the light of the atomic bomb.  His thinking remains important today as a warning to those who continue to enmesh the United States in foreign wars that have no direct bearing on national interest.  While this book lies outside of the familiar Left versus Right spectrum, it provides a unique contribution to political thought, even if its prophecy must be somewhat revised in the light of modern developments.  Nevertheless, its fundamental insights into the immorality of a system which results in modern war and crippling national debts remain sound.	2005-06-15
US	50058656	R13PA5ORRHHC4H	0312302592	385557836	The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization	Books	5	20	26	N	N	Patrick Buchanan - "Blood and Soil" Conservative.	_The Death of the West:  How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization_ by ultra-conservative former presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan, is a disturbing account of recent population trends and cultural shifts which threaten to bring about the downfall of the West as we know it.  Buchanan is obviously indebted to the conservative revolutionary Oswald Spengler, whose _Decline of the West_ proved especially prescient during the post-World War I era.  Buchanan, a staunch traditional Roman Catholic, attempts to explain how the European population is dying out, as European women produce fewer and fewer children and the population ages.  Buchanan blames these demographic shifts on the widespread abundance of birth control, the decline in traditional morals that emphasized marriage and family, and the feminist agenda which outright denies all differences between the sexes.  In particular the prospects for Russia are particularly bad, causing some including the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky to call for a restoration of polygamy and a moratorium on abortion to boost the population.  Certainly the widespread availability of contraceptives and abortion have made possible the significant population decline among those of European ancestry. <br /> <br />Buchanan's answer to the population crisis includes bringing back the idea of a \\"family wage\\" or a \\"just wage\\", a part of Catholic social teaching and expressed in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.  By bringing back a wage sufficient for a man to support a large family, it would no longer be necessary for as many women to enter the workplace if they chose to have a family instead.  The movement of the country away from an agrarian basis and towards an industrial and finally a post-industrial foundation in which American jobs are shipped overseas and Americans are forced to work for less and less pay has been a true loss for the American people.   <br /> <br />Buchanan identifies the source of the population crisis to be at root caused by a cultural crisis brought on by the revolution.  Buchanan correctly points out that while the Cold War is over, a victory for the West and capitalism, the culture war remains.  Echoing conservative libertarian Paul Gottfried, Buchanan shows how Marxists came to discover something that few realize (though Buchanan certainly has latched onto this truth as well), and that is that the proletariat is fundamentally socially conservative.  Recognizing this fact, Marxists turned their attention away from the proletariat as the dynamo for revolution and towards the cultural elite.  Thus, Marxism became cultural.  With the advent of Critical Theory and other post-modern philosophies (and their eventual triumph in 1990's political correctness), Marxists in the Frankfurt School sought to destroy the West by attacking its cultural roots.  By labelling all those who stood for tradition as \\"authoritarian personalities\\" and therefore potential fascists, cultural Marxists were able to attack the root of tradition and thus cut down the West.  Buchanan spends a good deal of time lambasting the feminist agenda and the homosexual agenda, two of the prime movements behind the culture wars.  Both agendas seek to deny the legitimacy of sex differences and thereby destroy the traditional family, the last bastion of hope against the corrosive forces of Marxism.  From their elite posts in America's academy, the politically correct left continues to howl and blaspheme against God and country, while enforcing their Orwellian thought control techniques on innocents.  Indeed, as Huey Long suggested, When fascism comes to America, it will come in the name of anti-fascism. <br /> <br />A third component of Buchanan's counter-revolutionary approach involves the restriction of foreign immigration, particularly from the Third World, including Mexico.  America is being besieged by a tidal wave of immigration (both legal and illegal) which is completely altering the demographic landscape of the country.  Buchanan points out that many Hispanics do not share traditional cultural values and seek restitutions for alleged past wrongs by the White race.  Buchanan shows how the founding fathers identified a nation as one consisting of those of common ancestry.  But, not only is America being besieged by immigrants, but Europe is as well.  Muslim immigrants continue to invade the European nations in record numbers.  It is for this reason that the European union and the New World Order must be opposed as contrary to the right of national sovereignity.  It is at this point that Buchanan most differs from the supposed \\"neoconservatives\\" who cannot see anything of higher value than the Almighty dollar. <br /> <br />Finally, Buchanan points out how our culture has lost its Christian basis.  Pornography and filth and blasphemy against God has made its way into our museums and institutions of learning as well as the media and degraded the general character of our culture.  Buchanan offers several viable alternatives to retake America for tradition.  Since the culture has reached a stage of such degradation and decadence, it may become necessary to completely sever oneself from the mainstream culture such as the Amish have done.  Certainly the movement among many to homeschool their children is a positive start.  Buchanan offers several ideas for education, including a proper teaching of history and a respect for God and country.  While prospects look dim, we know by divine mandate that the Christian West will not be lost and the devil will not triumph.  Certainly a Western renaissance seems difficult given the current state of things, however by approaching the problem one step at a time and refusing to stand quietly by as all that was once sacred is destroyed it may indeed be possible to reclaim our destiny and to save the West from its untimely demise.     <br />	2005-06-14

R. R. Tolkien and defend him from some of the attacks made against him by various critics.  Critics have often looked down on Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy and attempted to pigeonhole Tolkien into various unsavory categories.  This book takes a look at Tolkien from an anti-modernist perspective, particularly with reference to his love for nature and the English countryside.  The author emphasizes three aspects of Tolkien's works (_The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_, _The Silmarillion_ is left out of this book for the most part) \\"The Shire:  Culture, Society and Politics\\", \\"Middle-Earth:  Nature and Ecology\\", and \\"The Sea:  Spirituality and Ethics\\".  Tolkien, who was a deeply conservative and very pious man of the Roman Catholic faith, may be understood in terms of a \\"radical nostalgia\\" which surrounds much of his writing.  Tolkien had a great love for the unspoiled English countryside, for the rural life untouched by modern industry, and for small business unencumbered by the excesses of monopoly.  Tolkien also was a great lover of nature, his books include much on \\"tree lore\\", and he writes of the armies of orcs who are cutting down trees and destroying forests.  Politically Tolkien was conservative, but also libertarian with a bent towards anarchy.  Tolkien wrote that \\"My [Tolkien's] political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control, not whiskered men with bombs) - or to `unconstitutional' monarchy.\\"  Tolkien also wrote approvingly of the dynamiting of factories and power-stations, and wrote that he was no socialist, entirely rejecting planning as a harmful invasion.  Many critics have made various absurd allegations against Tolkien based on allegorical readings of his books, something he warned against.  For instance, critics have called Tolkien anationalist, a racist, and even a fascist for his praise of the English countryside.  Others have claimed that for Tolkien, North is a sacred direction and that he was a nordicist, while the armies of orcs coming from the South represent various nonEuropean races.  In addition, some have argued that Tolkien's use of the color white to represent purity and black to represent darkness and evil is racist.  Another bizarre interpretation is a Marxist interpretation of the dragon as representing monopoly capital and the hoarding of wealth.  According to this interpretation, _The Hobbit_ may be read in terms of class struggle, with an alliance of the lower middle class (the Hobbits) and working class miners (the dwarves) against an evil monopoly.  On the other hand, Tolkien has been repeatedly called an elitist, who emphasized pure Englishness - pastoral and cozy - against the rest of the world.  These interpretations are particularly absurd in light of Tolkien's own specific warning against the allegorical reading of his books, and Tolkien's specific denial that he was an \\"Aryan\\" when asked to provide evidence for this by the Nazis.  More promising readings of Tolkien emphasize his love for the earth and for nature.  In fact, Tolkien was particularly appalled with the chopping down of forests and the ruin of the countryside brought about through war and excessive industrialization.  The author of this book places a special emphasis on these interpretations.  With a coming global ecological crisis and the complete loss of transcendence brought on by modernism, scientism, materialism, and the New World Order, Tolkien's books may prove particularly pertinent today in their distinct anti-modernism.  Indeed, in one interpretation, although rejected by Tolkien himself, the Ring may represent atomic energy.  Although Tolkien rejected this, it is certainly clear that the Ring represents power and probably power over nature.  In terms of religion, Tolkien was a devout traditional Roman Catholic.  Many have found a Christian interpretation for _The Lord of the Rings_, arguing that the story shows the working out of the Christian virtues of humility and obedience, emphasizing the role that \\"small people\\" (i.e. Hobbits) may play in the world.  However, others have found in Tolkien's writings a distinctly pagan, animist, or pantheist understanding.  The pagan virtue of courage certainly plays no small part in the story.  Tolkien himself was an expert linguist, who had worked closely with ancient and medieval Anglo-Saxon poetry, including _Beowulf_ and Cynewulf's poem _Christ_ (the inspiration for the term \\"Middle-Earth\\").  In these poems and sagas, pagan and Christian elements are blended together.  In addition, Tolkien's expertise in languages may have led him to create the distinct Elvish tongues seen throughout his books.  In particular, the pagan notion of reincarnation is not passed over by Tolkien, who incorporates these ideas into his elvish characters.  To understand _The Lord of the Rings_ one must understand the role of myth.  Indeed, Tolkien may have sought to create a unique Anglo-Saxon myth, combining pagan and Christian elements.  Today, Tolkien's writings remain some of the most popular ever written.  While this has caused many critics to scoff at them, the author of this book believes their popularity resides in the fact that they tap into something deeper within us that rejects modernity and its crises, including especially the ecological crisis.  Tolkien's books have proven especially popular among those in the counter-culture.  Perhaps this is because they speak to those who look for viable alternatives to the present day dilemmas of the modern world.	2005-06-07
US	50058656	R3M31SE5ILI3E4	0820412945	699916710	Against Democracy and Equality (American University Studies)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	The New Right Against Democracy and Equality.	_Against Democracy and Equality:  The European New Right_ by Croatian born political scientist Tomislav Sunic, republished by The Noontide Press, is a unique book that examines some of the thinking that has issued from the pens of various European intellectuals in a postwar millieu calling themselves the \\"New Right\\".  This is one of the few books in English which attempts to adequately deal with these much maligned individuals and present their ideas to the general public in the United States.<br /><br />In the preface by conservative libertarian Paul Gottfried, he notes that it is often difficult to know what to make of the European New Right intellectuals.  While they claim to disdain both democracy and equality, they remain firmly opposed to both the economism of American capitalism and the totalitarianism of Soviet communism (this book was originally written before the fall of the Soviet Union).  These thinkers often trace the roots of the egalitarian principle to what they refer to as \\"Judeo-Christianity\\", emphasizing instead the pagan practices of ancient Europe and opposing polytheism to monotheism.  In this sense, many of the European New Right thinkers can be seen as inheritors of the legacy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose philosophy of the Overman has proven so difficult for the modern age.  However, this emphasis on neopaganism has led many of them to be delegitimized by their fellow conservatives, even those conservatives who share their disdain for American \\"neoconservativism\\".  The book also begins with a foreward by David J. Stennett in which he notes the disdain of many in the New Right for modern day technologies.  However, according to David Stennett, the New Right must embrace the internet and the air waves if they are to have any hope of accomplishing something.<br /><br />Professor Sunic begins by contrasting the New Right with other manifestations on the political right in Europe as well as the American Old Right.  In the United States, Christianity whether in its Protestant or Roman Catholic form has played a much greater role in the shaping of conservativism than among the European New Right.  Many among the European New Right incorporate elements that may be thought of as \\"leftist\\" among the central tenets of their beliefs (among these the possibility of an alliance with modern \\"Greens\\" and others who oppose extreme capitalism and the myth of progress).  This has made them truly revolutionary and heirs to the great tradition of the \\"conservative revolutionaries\\" whose philosophies were ransacked by Hitler.  Indeed, many on the left and among the politically correct have sought to chastise the New Right by attempting to associate them with fascism (a word which apart from the regime of Benito Mussolini may have no proper meaning).  Chief among the New Right thinkers are those who belong to \\"G.R.E.C.E.\\", a movement which emphasizes the Hellenic virtues.  Prominent members of the New Right include Alain de Benoist of France and Michael Walker, publisher of _The Scorpion_ of England.  Alain de Benoist, whose thinking emphasizes a return to pagan virtues, is perhaps the leading figure of the European New Right.<br /><br />This book is divided into two sections, the first focusing on the New Right and the \\"conservative revolutionaries\\", and the second focusing on egalitarianism and the roots of the modern crisis.  In the first section, Sunic devotes separate chapters to the most famous conservative revolutionaries:  Carl Schmitt, Oswald Spengler, and Vilfredo Pareto, and explains how their thought came to influence New Right thinkers.  In addition, thinkers such as Julius Evola and Francis Parker Yockey also play a good deal of importance for the European New Right.  Sunic also explains how the New Right came to regard paganism as Europe's great heritage usurped by Christianity, although he contrasts the thinking of Roman Catholic philosopher Thomas Molnar and Alain de Benoist (both of whom are good friends and mutually supportive).  The second section of this book is devoted to showing the errors in the myth of equality.  Here, Sunic explains the role of genetics in revealing the inequality among men (although many in the New Right reject a strict biological determinism).  The New Right also emphasizes an organic state, much in agreement with that of such economic thinkers as Othmar Spann, as opposed to the excesses of capitalism, consumerism, materialism, and Marxism.  Sunic devotes a considerable amount of attention to the concept of totalitarianism, which many among the New Right rail against.  This totalitarianism may take the shape of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, or modern day liberalism (a \\"soft\\" totalitarianism according to the New Right).  The book ends with separate chapters focusing on modern day liberalism (democracy and capitalism) and the Soviet Union.  Sunic devoted a good deal of attention to the thinking of Zinoviev, a Soviet dissident, who attempted to explain the power of the Soviet state from within.  While this aspect of the book may appear somewhat dated, overall the prophecies of those among the New Right remain sound.<br /><br />This book offers a unique opportunity for American readers to become familiar with a special blend of European thought that is coming into its own.

US	50058656	RH4SVIQ0Y6JY3	0226021505	396789061	The Internet and the Madonna: Religious Visionary Experience on the Web	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The Internet, the Virgin Mary, and the Faithful.	_The Internet and the Madonna:  Religious Visionary Experience on the Web_ by Paolo Apolito in the series \\"Religion and Postmodernism\\" consists of reflections on the relationship between the internet, the Christian faithful, and the Blessed Virgin Mary.  This book attempts to map out the new terrain made prominent with the growth of various discussion groups and websites dedicated to the Virgin Mary and her apparitions on the internet.  The book discusses many of the major apparitions, including those at Medjugorje, Garabandal, and Fatima, and the role that modern technology is coming to play in their propagation.  The book also discusses many of the seers and visionaries who claim to receive messages directly from Jesus or the Virgin Mother and who write about their experiences on their own personal websites and in discussion forums.  Among these seers are Laura Zink, who lives in Vermont and allegedly receives messages from the Virgin Mary, Vernoica Leuken, of Bayside apparition fame, and Vassula Ryden, a Greek Orthodox visionary who has written about her experiences.  While many of these figures remain controversial, it is interesting to note the sort of relationship that has developed between the Catholic church hierarchy and various visionaries claiming to receive messages from the Virgin Mother or Jesus.  The more famous apparitions, including those at Medjugorje and Garabandal, remain controversial because of friction that has developed between the visionaries and the church hierarchy over their interpretation.  The author attempts to explain how the internet has opened up an entirely new component to the experiences of the visionary, which often take place entirely outside of church sanction.  The author also devotes a good deal of space to discussing the role of various modern technologies, including film and television, but also modern scientific instruments, in the determination of the miraculous appearances of the Virgin around the world.  While some ofthe apparitions may be scoffed at by skeptics (or even regarded as satanically influenced by some fundamentalist Protestants or even some Catholics), they remain an important development in modern religious experience.  And the internet is coming to play a much larger role in that experience as well, by serving as the method for propagating religious belief.   <br /> <br />Belief in the \\"end times\\" also plays an important part in the life of many religious mystics in the modern internet age.  Many of those who adhere to the messages of the visionaries believe in an imminent apocalypse, often accompanied by natural catastrophe, nuclear war, and other political upheavals.  They have come to embrace a culture of survivalism often combining with right wing political elements.  The internet is particularly important for such individuals as it allows them an opportunity to spread their ideas to others free from the scorn of the general public.  With the appearance of the Virgin at Fatima and her prophecy there, various websites have sprang up focusing specifically on these end times events. <br /> <br />As a form of modern technology, the internet has problems which the unprepared believer may encounter in his or her search through the web.  The author explains how the internet has created a vacuum in authority as well as a trend towards levelling which reduces all systems of belief to the same common denominator.  In addition, many individuals have specifically linked these apparitions with the New Age or with various \\"hidden mysteries\\" websites.  The author also explains how often an unsuspecting individual may encounter links to various disturbing, blasphemous, or even pornographic sites simply by following the trail of links on a given webpage. <br /> <br />This book provides a unique study of the relationship between modern religious experience and the role that the internet and other modern technologies are coming to play in that experience.  Many of the faithful have flocked to the internet as a means to spread their message to many others easily and effectively as well as being a source of prayer.  While the internet poses its own set of challenges, it remains a unique tool for Christians which can allow for groups and nontraditional communities to meet which would never have the opportunity to meet otherwise.  Although many among the traditional faithful remain wary of new technologies, many others are meeting the challenge of the modern age by taking advantage of the internet as a medium of communication.   <br />	2005-06-05

Saint Malachy of Armagh, Ireland was an eleventh century bishop and saint who died in the hands of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and who foretold the day and hour of his own death.  According to legend, Saint Malachy had a series of visions while visiting Rome which consisted of the prophecies regarding all future popes till the end of time.  These prophecies consist of brief Latin descriptions of all the popes, which have born an uncanny resemblance to various aspects of each subsequent pope's reign.  Many have scoffed at these prophecies, and some regard them to be forgeries, however they continue to hold up to scrutiny even into these modern times.  Malachy predicted 112 popes ahead of his time until the destruction of the Church of Rome and the end of the world.  These predictions are especially relevant to these modern times because depending on how the prophecies are interpreted, it may be that we are living near the end of days.  According to the prophecies, the recently deceased Pope John Paul II was \\"De Labore Solis\\", and the soon to be elected future pope will be \\"Gloria Olivae\\".  This pope will be followed by the last pope \\"Petrus Romanus\\".  Malachy has written \\"In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church there will reign Peter the Roman, who will feed his flock among many tribulations; after which the seven-hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people.\\"  Some have interpreted this to mean that following Pope John Paul II there are only two popes left.  However, others more wary of this interpretation have suggested that \\"Petrus Romanus\\" need not follow directly after \\"Gloria Olivae\\" but there may be a gap.  This interpretation seems to make sense.  These prophecies also predict many of the antipopes who reigned along with the popes but who were deemed not canonically elected by the church.  With the recent death of Pope John Paul II and much speculation regarding his successor, as well as with the events of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent crisis in the church, these prophecies are proving particularly important to consider.  They have enjoyed immense popularity and consider to do so as we near the coming papal election.  Indeed, it may be that we are living near the end of days as predicted by the prophets.	2005-04-16

Paul Johnson is a book which attempts to shed some light on the historical personages behind Madame Blavatsky's hidden masters.  Madame Blavatsky's career is shrouded in mystery and the movement of Theosophy which grew from that career remains engimatic for many spiritual seekers as well as cultural historians.  Blavatsky, who was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research, claimed at various times to be receiving messages from hidden masters, prime among these were individuals known as Morya and Koot Hoomi.  While the society found her claims to be fraudulent, others involved in the Theosophical movement maintained their legitimacy to varying degrees.  This book offers evidence that will meet the challenge of the skeptic as well as the true believer alike.  The author notes how political intrigue came to play a central role in Blavatsky's hidden messengers.  The book covers various individuals who the author regards to be \\"adepts\\" and \\"mahatmas\\", individuals who Blavatsky knew and who she incorporated into her myth of the hidden masters.  Among the adepts are Prince Pavel Dolgorukii, Prince Aleksandr Golitsyn, Albert Rawson, Paolos Metamon, Agardi Metrovitch, Giuseppe Mazzini, Louis Maximilien Bimstein, Jamal ad-Din \\"al-Afghani\\", James Sanua, Lydia Pashkov, Ooton Liatto, Marie Countess of Caithness, Sir Richard Burton, Abdelkader, Raphael Borg, James Peebles, Charles Sotheran, and Mikhail Katkov.  Among the mahatmas are Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, Shyamaji Krishnavarma, Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Kashmir, Thakar Singh Sandhanwalia, Maharaja Holkar of Indore, Bhai Gurmukh Singh, Baba Khem Singh Bedi, Surendranath Banerjea, Dayal Singh Majithia, Sumangala Unnanse, Sarat Chandra Das, Ugyen Gyatso, Sengchen Tulku, and Swami Sankaracharya of Mysore.  Many of these individuals had special political connections or were linked to the religious movement of Sikhism.  This book shows how all were involved to some extent in the life of Madame Blavatsky and how she incorporated these individuals into her hidden master myth.  While this book is sure to be rejected by outright skeptics who deny any historical reality to the masters and by adherents to Theosophy who maintain allegiance to Blavatsky's teachings, it is sure to provide interesting material for those who come to this subject from a third viewpoint.	2005-03-01

The book covers a great deal, but mostly it focuses on various schisms and scandals within spiritualism, theosophical, and proto-New Age movements.  The book also shows the human side of the many spiritualists, magicians, cranks, and mediums - the western gurus who followed from theosophy.<br /><br />The book begins by discussing various forms of spiritualism in the early Nineteenth century.  Spiritualism developed as people grew disenfranchised with both materialism and scientism, brought on by modern progress in science, evolutionism (Darwinism), and developments in modern physics, as well as classical religion.  Among the various spiritualist groups discussed include the Fox sisters, who allegedly made contact with the spirit world, various groups which grew out of Anglicanism and liberal movements within the church, Mormonism, and Christian Science.  All these new religious movements promised contrast to both modern materialism and something different from classical religion.  In addition, new doctrines from the East began to become popular.<br /><br />It was in this environment, that Henry Olcott made contact with Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and out of this contact and friendship developed the Theosophical Society.  Blavatsky, the daughter of a Russian aristocrat, made various outrageous claims regarding her early life and her travels.  She claimed to have visited Tibet where she made contact with certain Hidden Masters.  She was also to write two important works, _Isis Unveiled_ which argued against the materialism and scientism of her day and _The Secret Doctrine_ which outlined her system, revealed her racial doctrines, and expressed her belief in Hidden Masters.  The headquarters of the Theosophical Society were subsequently moved from New York to India, where various conflicts between the temperamental and morbidly obese Blavatsky and other members arose.<br /><br />One of the earlier converts to Theosophy was Charles Webster Leadbeater, a pedophiliac prelate who helped found the Liberal Catholic Church (a splinter sect off the Old Catholic Church which maintained allegiance to Theosophy).  Leadbeater helped found a school for boys along with Annie Besant.  Annie Besant, had begun as a radical - socialist and feminist - who developed an interest in Theosophy.  She was subsequently to take over the position of Blavatsky within the society.  Together Leadbeater and Besant took an interest in a young Indian child whose father had become a convert to Theosophy.  This was Krishnamurti whose teachings eventually made their way to the West where he was schooled.  Krishnamurti, himself, was involved in various scandals, including love affairs with older and married women.<br /><br />Rudolph Steiner was another individual who took an early interest in Theosophy.  He came from a background which included studies in German idealist philosophy and the writings of Goethe.  Later, Steiner was to break off from the Theosophical Society and form his own movement, Anthroposophy.  Steiner, always a polymath, had a wide range of interests and was to commission the building of a Goethaneum, modelled on the Wagnerian festivals in Bayreuth.  In addition to Steiner, the esotericist Count Herman Keyserling also taught a blend of mysticism.<br /><br />Two other important figures in the history of Western occultism are those of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, who had a brief alliance with each other.  Gurdjieff, a native of Georgia in Russia, was an occult teacher who visited St. Petersburg where he met the intellectual Ouspensky to whom he taught his system.  Gurdjieff later became known for his difficult teachings and excessive emphasis on hard work, leading to spiritual wakefulness, or so it was believed.  It was always rumored that Gurdjieff was impossible to work with and excessively authoritarian leading many to madness or even suicide under his watch.  Ouspensky was an intellectual who developed an interest in the occult through mathematics and modern physics.  He was later to split with Gurdjieff though retaining Gurdjieff's system.  Another individual who played some role in the history of Gurdjieff's teaching was that of Orage.<br /><br />Other individuals covered in this book include Aldous Huxley, J. G. Bennett, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, and Idries Shah, all claiming to possess unique spiritual wisdom from the East.  This book provides an interesting survey of the teachings of various spiritualists from the mid Nineteenth century to the beginning of the modern era.  Nearly all reflect the teachings of Madame Blavatsky in their own teachings, especially her belief in Hidden Masters.  Later, these individuals were to provide the basis for the beginnings of the New Age movement which owes much to them.	2005-01-24

Rider Haggard was obviously influenced by spiritualism in his younger days, and his belief in reincarnation is revealed in this novel.  The novel shows an obsession with death as well as with the feminine principle revealed in the queen, Ayesha (referred to as \\"She-who-must-be-obeyed\\" or simply \\"She\\" or \\"Hiya\\" by the natives).  The novel has been called imperialist because it shows the travels of several British adventurers in the dark continent of Africa.<br /><br />This novel begins when L.

Bulwer-Lytton spends much time expounding upon the culture, the language, the traits, and the religion of this underworld race, which may seek someday to rise to the surface of the Earth again from whence it came.  This race has a culture and civilization quite distinct from that of the Victorian world in which Bulwer-Lytton and the narrator lived.  There are two sexes, the Ana (or males) and the Gy-ei (or females), but their roles are somewhat reversed with the Gy-ei courting the Ana. In this respect Bulwer-Lytton sought to parody the female rights movement of his time and the ideas of philosophers such as John Stuart Mill.  Also, the Ana believe themselves to be descended from frogs, or to be followed by frogs, parodying the ideas of Darwinian evolution.  The society of the Ana is entirely aristocratic and free from passion, strife, crime, and war though these notions occur in their history books.  The Ana look down upon the government of the many as Koom-Posh.  This may reveal Bulwer-Lytton's aristocratic prejudices.  In addition, the children of the society serve as guardians until they reach marriageable age.  Bulwer-Lytton also discusses the language of the Vril-ya, where he owes a debt to Max Muller to whom he dedicated this novel.  This language resembles the Indo-European tongues which were being studied at the time.  While in the subterranean world, the narrator (who is referred to as a Tish by the Ana) witnesses the enormous power which the Ana yield through Vril.  He watches as this power is used to destroy a reptilian monster who had made off with his friend at the beginning of the story.  In addition, he learns much of their customs and society.  He also witnesses a funeral in which the power of Vril again is used to incinerate a corpse.  Eventually, a certain Gy named Zee becomes enamored of him.  The Gy-ei are larger than the Ana and are especially learned.  This relationship though is one that cannot be and forces the narrator to make an important decision.  This tale is bizarre and offers a unique look into the utopian mindset of the Victorian era.  The novels of Bulwer-Lytton came to have much influence on many later writers including such individuals as Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, the Russian seeress who plagiarized much from his stories.  Subterranean worlds have came to be a source of fascination and were incorporated into many of the traditions of the ancient world and of the Nineteenth century.o is referred to as a Tish by the Ana) witnesses the enormous power which the Ana yield through Vril.

This planet is the cradle of human mind, but one cannot spend all one's life in a cradle. <br />- Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. <br /> <br />_Konstantin Tsiolkovsky:  His Life and Work_ by A. Kosmodemyanksky is the biography of Russian rocket pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.  Tsiolkovsky's work included research into the mechanics of the all metal dirigible, designs for an aeroplane and wind tunnel, as well as the theory of rocketry.  Tsiolkovsky also wrote on interplanetary travel as well as writing some science fiction and philosophical works.  From an early age Tsiolkovsky showed an interest in mathematics, physics, and natural science; however, he was hampered by various difficulties including near deafness which overcame him after a bout of scarlet fever.  Tsiolkovsky began his researches in the theory of the all metal dirigible.  However, his work was not recognized or funded sufficiently in tsarist Russia.  Later, when the Soviets came to power Tsiolkovsky became recognized for his work in rocketry.  Tsiolkovsky believed that man would conquer space and his writing proved prophetic in that he suggested rockets would be used to achieve interplanetary travel.  Tsiolkovsky offered several distinct designs for rockets and studied the chemistry necessary to understand their fuel requirements.  He also derived an equation which showed the velocity necessary to escape the earth's gravitational field.  He was regarded by many as a dreamer and utopian for his ideas on interplanetary travel and the future of the human race.  His work continues to be important today and his theories have proven prescient to our modern continuing discovery of space.  This book provides an excellent introduction to his scientific and mechanical thought as it pertains to rocketry. <br />	2005-01-14

Marie Corelli was an English novelist of the Victorian era who was much criticized in her day for her scathing criticism of the materialism, positivism, and scientism popular in the late Nineteenth century as revealed in her novels.  This novel expounds an occult theory of Christianity based on electricity.  At the same time however, the author decries the excesses of spiritism that had made their way to fill in the gap left by materialist philosophy.  The author does not espouse any particular creed of Christianity, though this novel focuses upon Catholicism; however, her theory of the occult essence in electricity is unique.  This is what makes up her \\"Electric Creed of Christianity\\".  The book includes an introduction and preface written by the author as well as an appendix containing letters testifying to the uniqueness of Marie Corelli's spiritualism.  Corelli was obviously influenced by Swedenborgianism and Theosophy as well which can be seen in the novel in several places. <br /> <br />This novel tells the tale of the author, a pianist, who has become ill with a physical depression due to overwork.  At the request of her doctor, who has run out of cures, she is advised to leave London and head for warmer climes.  She travels with two friends, an American colonel and his wife.  She arrives in Cannes where she meets the artist, Raffaelo Cellini, who has acquired an amazing system of color and who offers to paint her portrait.  Although she is ill, she decides to allow him to do so.  While Cellini is painting her portrait he offers her a magic elixer which provides her with three visions of a mysterious individual known as Heliobas.  She is to find out that Heliobas is the artist's master and that he had saved Cellini from a similar depression.  She is given abook to examine which reveals the hidden spiritual meaning in music and she also meets Heliobas' incredible Newfoundland dog Leo who travels back and forth from Paris where Heliobas resides bringing messages.  Cellini agrees to have her meet Heliobas who will be able to cure her through his wonderful electrical powers.  The author travels to Paris where she meets Heliobas and is given special potions which enable her to make a full recovery.  She also meets Heliobas' sister Zara, a sculptress impressive in her own right, and their friend Prince Ivan.  Heliobas is a mysterious Chaldean who has mastered the art of electricity.  He allows the author to experience entirely new realms, including interplanetary travel in which she sees for herself the glories of God, the angelic being Azul (Heliobas' \\"twin soul\\"), her own guardian angel, and the mysteries of Christianity.  All of this is accomplished through what Marie Corelli calls \\"electricity\\".  Zara herself is possessed of special electrical powers and wears a special stone which serves to channel her electrical charge.  The book encompasses at once mystery, romance, tragedy, and yet it offers hope through Christian belief against the materialism and atheism of the age.  Throughout Corelli notes how many have scoffed at traditional belief in Christ and that few will understand her novel or its inner meaning.  The novel also offers philosophical proof for the existence of God and the truth of God incarnate as Christ.  The writing is beautiful and majestic, truly appealing to the inner soul.  This novel remains a unique experience among Victorian writers and represents the first attempt of Marie Corelli at writing novels.  <br />	2005-01-14

This book covers much material dealing with the archeological remains available from the ancient Celts, as well as material from ancient texts (mostly written by Greeks and Romans).  The first section of this book covers the archeological remains of the ancient Celts, including tombs and various artifacts which are believed to be connected with the Druids.  These remains are present throughout Britain and Ireland as well as in parts of Continental Europe, from France all the way to Czechoslovakia.  The second section deals with ancient texts which help inform the archeological discoveries.  Important writings from Posidonious, Lucan, and Caesar are explained.  To the ancients, the world was believed to have fallen from a lost Golden Age, and thus the ancient barbarian tribes represented this pastoral paradise.  Thus, druids were depicted as noble priests and wizards who ruled as philosophers and poets of nature as part of a soft primitivism.  However, as part of a hard primitivism it was noted that druids practiced human sacrifice and engaged in ghastly rituals (often involving mistletoe as a sacred plant).  Caesar and others were appalled by these cannibalistic rites and had them prohibited.  The third section of this book deals with the romantic notions of the druid that sprang up later.  These romantic notions again incorporated elements of soft primtivism, presenting the druids as noble savages (much as the inhabitants of the New World were perceived), or hard primitivism, presenting the savagery (especially human sacrifice) of the druids.  Important writers developed the druid myth, often deriving them from the children of Noah after the flood.  The druids came to play some part in the thinking of deists and nature worshippers but also in that of orthodox Christians who saw in the druids a precursor to their own faith.  Early writers dealing with the druids included John Toland, William Stukeley, and William Blake.  Also, the stone monuments such as Stonehenge came to be associated with the ancient druids through this romantic literature.  Within the last hundred years, societies sprang up claiming druidic pedigrees for themselves.  Indeed, one such druidic society included among its members Winston Churchill.  Today many of these druidic societies hold rites around Stonehenge and other sacred monuments during certain times of the year.  The author stresses however the distinction between druids-as-known and druids-as-wished-for.  This book provides an excellent introduction to the archeology of the ancient Celts and the history of the druids.	2005-01-06

Ossendowski's Journey Through Mysterious Asia.	_Beasts, Men and Gods_, reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, is Ferdinand Ossendowski's fascinating account of his adventures and travels in northern Asia; Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, and China, in an effort to flee the Red army of the Russian revolution.  Dr. Ossendowski was a scientist and writer who lived for a time in Siberia when the Russian revolution broke out.  It came about that he became suspected of being a counter-revolutionary and thus had to flee his home one day into the forests.  There he began his adventures as related in this book, where he met up first with a murderer and later with various peasants along the way.  Eventually, Ossendowski joined the White forces in Mongolia who opposed the revolution and the Bolsheviki.  Much of the book is spent relating the various political events that occur in the \\"heart of Asia\\" involving Russia, China, Mongolia, and Tibet, and the relations between these nations.  The book becomes interesting however when Ossendowski begins to relate the tales of the Buddhist religion of Mongolia.  He encounters many of the Lamas, holy pontiffs, and doctors of this religion and relates tales of the Dalai Lama in Lhasa in Tibet, as well as tales of various fortune tellers, poisoners, and soothsayers.  Ossendowski also encounters \\"the Living Buddha\\", the King of Mongolia, who has become blind through excessive drinking.  The Living Buddha is chosen from among the peasants as the incarnation of the Living Buddha in a child (his soul having passed into another body after the death of the previous Living Buddha) and this child is taken to be reared by the Lamas.  The Living Buddha relates a special prophecy for all of Asia, which Ossendowski records.  In addition, Ossendowski becomes fascinated with tales of a mysterious subterranean kingdom called Agarthi (similar to the kingdom of Aggartha noted by another writer Saint-Yves d'Alveydre in his _Mission de l'Inde_) which can be reached by passageways from throughout the world.  In Aggarthi the King of the World or Brahytma lives along with his two assistants, Mahytma (who knows the purposes of future events), and Mahynga (who rules the causes of these events).  From what Ossendowski is able to piece together of this legend, many have travelled to the kingdom of Agarthi, returning with much scientific knowledge.  In addition, in 1890 the King of the World appeared in a temple to make a special prophecy regarding Asia and the world in the coming century.  There he noted that many events and cataclysms would occur, followed by the emergence of those who dwell in the subterranean kingdom into the upper world.  Ossendowski's adventure ends at this point, with him travelling to Peking in China and eventually making his way back out of Asia to Europe again.  Ossendowski wonders what will happen when Asia rises up to meet Europe in the coming century.  This book which has proven itself to be prophetic has remained popular with esotericists ever since.  It remains a fascinating travel adventure which occurs at an historic moment, the coming of the Russian revolution and the rise of the communist state at the beginning of the twentieth century.	2005-01-04

Superstition brings bad luck.  -  Raymond Smullyan, _5000 B.C._ <br /> <br />The conspiracy theory of society . . . comes from abandoning God and then asking:  \\"Who is in his place?\\"  -Karl Popper, _Conjectures and Refutations_. <br /> <br /> <br />_Foucault's Pendulum_ by Italian semiotician Umberto Eco is a fascinating novel which combines elements of mystery and suspense with occult knowledge and traditionalist philosophy.  I first read this book in high school in the nineties and it has remained one of my favorite books ever since.  The story involves several main characters, all intellectuals, who work for a publishing house, Garamond Press.  The main character and narrator begins as a student in Italy working on a Ph.D. thesis on the Knights Templar, the medieval society of crusading knights who became very powerful and wealthy bankers and eventually were accused of heresy along with engaging in ghastly rituals and the worship of a human head called the Baphomet.  The other two principle protagonists are employed by Garamond Press, and one is a foundling who believes himself to be of Jewish parentage and is extremely fascinated by the Kabbalah, the interpretation of the Torah, and numerology.  Eco gently mocks the leftish intellectual scene in Italy during the late sixties and seventies as well as the Marxist and post-modernist philosophies which were popular at the time among intellectuals.  One day a mysterious gentleman shows up at Garamond Press and offers his book to be published.  This man relates a wild tale involving a secret manuscript he has discovered and which he believes to preserve a hidden tradition from the Knights Templars carried up to the modern day.  He argues that a secret society is behind this event, providing many occult links to stonehenge, the Holy Grail, the Druids, ancient heresies, the medieval church, and modern day secret societies.  However, the next day this individual shows up dead.  This begins a drawn out sequence of eventswhich occur over several years eventually leading to the concoction of a secret Plan by the three principle characters as part of their publishing company's newfound interest in \\"Diabolicals\\", self-publishing authors who write on occult and conspiracy topics. <br /> <br />Eco's novel combines elements from African and Brazilian syncretistic religion, Christianity and gnosticism, occultism, Rosicrucianism, secret societies, esoteric political beliefs, legends about the immortal Comte de Saint-Germaine, Satanism, Blavatskian theosophy, freemasonry, the writings of Count Joseph de Maistre and Cretineau-Joly, esoteric conspiracy theories regarding the Jews and Nazism, theories of telluric currents and subterranean realms, the science of Foucault's pendulum, as well as much more.  Eco is clearly influenced also by two principle sources, including the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln written in the late 1980's which alleged that Jesus and Mary Magdelene were married and gave birth to a secret bloodline.  In addition, Eco is clearly influenced by the traditionalist school of philosophical thought founded by Rene Guenon and politicized by Julius Evola.  Finally, Eco's book reveals a unique esoteric political philosophy operating behind the scenes through an organization known as Tres, referred to as synarchy.  This system is revealed in the hidden Masters of the World who rule the world through a system of underground tunnels, residing in the center of the world in the subterranean kingdom of Aggartha.  This philosophy shows the influence on Eco of the writer Saint Yves d'Alvedrye and also Ferdinand Ossendowski.  Synarchy is the secret system by which the Masters of the World seek to control all worldly governments. <br /> <br />As an intellectual adventure story, Eco's novel is very fascinating.  It's meaning is revealed on many levels, indicating the fact that Eco's specialization lies in the field of semiotics, the science of the sign.  Indeed, all conspiracies and occult doctrines converge in \\"the Plan\\" which reveals itself through this novel.  Much in this book is true, although it requires special interpretation.  That interpretation can only be known by those who are well grounded in philosophy and esoteric tradition. <br />	2005-01-04

Martin Lings examines the world's religious traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, and the three great monotheistic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in terms of the perennial philosophy to understand the modern world and its plunge into darkness.   From the Gospels, Lings examines the parable of the laborers in the vineyard - those who arrive at the eleventh hour receive the same wages as those who labor throughout the day.  Lings also turns his attention to the errors of the modern world - which exists at the end of a cycle, the Kali yuga of the Hindus, the darkest of the dark ages - including especially Darwinism and evolution, scientism, and modern education.  Lings examines modern day political structures in the light of Plato's writings in his misnamed _Republic_ as a progression occurs from aristocracy (rule by the elite, the philosopher kings), to timarchy (rule by the Kshatriya caste), to oligarchy (rule by the Vaisya merchant caste), to democracy (the call for \\"liberty and equality\\"), to eventual tyranny.  This form of degradation is contrary to modern secular political thinking which trumpets democracy (with all its evils) as a great achievement of government.  Lings compares this to the various forms of Islamic theocracy, but notes how the original pure form has been lost.  Lings references various components within the religious traditions, particularly those of Islam and Roman Catholicism (where he notes the mistakes of the Second Vatican Council, the prophecies of the Virgin at Fatima, and the prophecies of Saint Malachy regarding the popes and the end of the world).  Lings next turns his attention to the \\"Spirit of the Times\\" in which he notes the positive features of the modern era.  Here, Lings references the Kalki, \\"the rider of the white horse\\", of the Hindu tradition and compares this figure to Christ in the Christian apocalypse.  Lings is particularly influenced by the traditionalist school of thought founded by two important figures Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy (who represent for him prophets calling to mind the apocalyptic accounts of Enoch and Elias).  In addition, other traditionalists such as Fritjhof Schuon as well as Titus Burckhardt, Leo Schaya, and Rama Coomaraswamy (son of Ananda Coomaraswamy and writer on the errors of Vatican II and the Roman Catholic Church) are mentioned by Lings.  Finally, Lings notes how a destructive force is underway which will result in a great tribulation on the Purification Day.  Here, Lings references both Christian and Islamic traditions involving the apocalyptic figures of Christ, the Antichrist, and the Mahdi of Islamic tradition.  Also, as revealed by the Virgin at Fatima the Cup of Divine Anger will overflow.  The book ends with four appendices including one discussing Sufism in the light of Fritjhof Schuon's writings (cf. _Sufism:  Veil and Quintessence_), one discussing the question of finding a spiritual master who will lead one in the path of esoterism, one discussing the Second Vatican Council in the light of the Virgin's prophecies at Fatima and Garabandal, and one discussing the prophecies of Saint Malachy regarding the future popes and the end of the world.  This book offers an excellent resource into the thinking of the traditionalist philosophy and provides a necessary antidote to the spiritual degradation of our times.	2005-01-01

The book shows the transformations that took place in the papacy as the relationship between temporal power and spiritual authority was worked out throughout the years.  Also, the book shows how the early popes were chosen, including how many were appointed by kings or their predecessors (often involving intrigue and poisonings), up until the invention of the conclave.  While the Roman Popes certainly were not impeccable, their spiritual authority in matters of faith and morals is guarranteed by the words of Christ himself.  Much of this book is spent reviewing the many scandals and intrigues of the popes who often acted in a manner more befitting a petty despot than the spiritual authority of the world's strongest religion.  Father Malachi Martin's thesis is that the church exists in a state of steady decline, brought about by a defection from its true principles, and an abandonment of spiritual authority for temporal power.  Indeed, the sins of man are many, due to his fallen nature, and throughout the centuries they have come to corrode the very structures upon which Christ built his church.  This book, written in 1981 is somewhat dated but its prophecy for the coming decades remains valid.  The complications which have arisen since the Second Vatican Counsel, the brazen disobedience of Christ's supposed faithful to the authority of the pope and his predecessors, the collusion of the hierarchy with liberalism, modernism, and Marxist revolution, and the moral decline of the modern age are issues which currently confront the church more than ever.  Perhaps the modern age can be made sense of in terms of prophecyby rereading those prophecies of the saints which reveal a hidden meaning behind historical events.  I regret only that the author did not provide adequate footnotes to his book so that his facts could be checked against standard sources.  He appears to take some liberty with things that may be unjustifiable.  Nevertheless, for its important remarks concerning the coming and continuing crises within the church (recently brought to light in the many scandals among the priesthood and the hierarchy) this book remains of fundamental interest to all who want to understand the history and progression of the Roman Catholic Church and its papacy.	2004-12-31

These legends were first made popular in the West by Saint Yves d'Alveydre in his _Mission de l'Inde_ in which he described his journeys in central Asia.  Later Ferdinand Ossendowski was also to mention this kingdom and the King of the World in his book _Beasts, Men and Gods_ also involving a journey to the East (and perhaps lifted from the work of d'Alveydre).  This book resulted from discussions among the French sinologist Rene Grousset, the neo-Thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, and Rene Guenon.<br /><br />The title \\"King of the World\\" refers to Manu (whose name appears in the ancient Greek king's name Minos) and is to be distinguished from the \\"Prince of this world\\" which refers to Satan in the Gospels (the two words being different in Hebrew and Arabic).  In fact, in Hebrew, the title \\"King of the World\\" may be readily applied to God Himself.  Manu may be understood as embodying the fundamental attributes of \\"Justice\\" and \\"Peace\\", which apply to the \\"King of the World\\".  This book combines traditions from the ancient world including those of the Hindus and Buddhists as well as from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the ancient Greeks and Celts.  Both spiritual authority and temporal power are united in the function of the \\"King of the World\\" as related through the ancient symbols of the swastika, the word AVM (or OM), and the Seal of Solomon.  The Kabbalistic notions of the Shekinah and Metatron are explained and reference is made to the work, _La Kabbale juive_ by Vulliaud.  In addition, the Celtic origins of the myth of the Grail are explained as they relate to the \\"King of the World\\" and the \\"four masters\\" of Ireland.  The priest-king Melki-Tsedek is also related to the \\"King of the World\\" as well as the mythical abode Luz where Jacob had his dream according to Scripture.  It is noted that the pope holds a position similar to that of the \\"King of the World\\" by way of spiritual power.  As in all his works, Guenon believes that the modern world exists in a state of crisis indicating the dark age, the Kali yuga.  In addition, the omphalos (or the \\"navel of the world\\") and sacred stones are explained in terms of their polar symbolism.  Also, the various spiritual centers of the world are to be understood in terms of the \\"King of the World\\" and the subterranean kingdom of Aggartha.  Finally, the works of the Catholic nun Venerable Anne Catherine Emmerich and the French traditionalist Count Joseph de Maistre are also mentioned in connection with the notion of the \\"King of the World\\".  This book contains a plethora of esoteric concepts which relate to that of the archetype of \\"King of the World\\" and is perhaps one of the few available books which fully discusses this notion along with the underground kingdom of Aggartha.	2004-12-31

Burckhardt quotes extensively from such figures in the traditional school of thought as Rene Guenon, Mircea Eliade, and Julius Evola (who all had written on alchemy), as well as Carl Jung, the depth psychologist who attempted to understand alchemy in terms of the collective unconscious (relating it to the process of individuation).  Burckhardt begins by noting that contrary to the modern historical and scientistic interpretation, alchemy was not so much a forerunner of modern day chemistry and science as it was a process of spiritual growth embodied in tradition.  Burckhardt notes how alchemy had its origins in the Egyptian deity of Thoth-Hermes and in the writings of Hermes Trismegistos which came out of Egypt.  Later, alchemy was to come to play an important part in all the world's great religious traditions, including Hindu, Buddhist, Chinese, and primitive Japanese religions as well as the three monotheistic religious traditions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Much of this book is spent discussing various source materials from these three monotheistic religious traditions as they relate to alchemical transformation.  Burckhardt notes that alchemy did not derive from a desire to enrich oneself by transmuting base metals into gold as had originally been conjectured.  Rather, the gold came to represent a spiritual state attained by the alchemist.  Much of this book is spent discussing the seven base metals as they relate to the seven planets and the four elements (air, earth, fire, water) as well as the ether.  In addition, the concept of the \\"chemical marriage\\" of sulphur and quicksilver, sun and moon, king and queen to achieve gold is explained.  Various symbols including the ouroborus, the caduceus (or staff of Hermes), the Christian cross, and the seal of Solomon are explained in terms of the alchemical meaning.  In addition, alchemy is related to the system of yoga and the kundalini, as well as other far eastern traditions.  The athanor or the oven in which the alchemical elixer is prepared is also explained in terms of its symbolism.  Burckhardt also includes a section discussing the life of Nicolas Flamel, a fourteenth century alchemist who came into contact with a special alchemical treatise.  In addition, the Emerald Tablets are discussed, which reveal the principle \\"whatever is below is like that which is above\\" showing the direct relation between macrocosm and microcosm (Man).  This represents an excellent source on alchemy as revealed through the lens of the traditionalist school of thought and the perennial philosophy.	2004-12-27

As for the adoration of crosses, which you object to against us, I must tell you that we neither adore crosses nor desire them.  You it is, ye Pagans, who worship wooden gods who are the most likely people to adore wooden crosses, as being parts of the same substance with your deities.  For what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards, but crosses gilt and beautified?  Your victorious trophies not only represent a simple cross, but a cross with a man upon it. <br />-Father Minucius Felix in his _Octavius_ written in A.D. 211 <br /> <br />_Aryan Sun-Myths:  The Origin of Religion_ is a reprint published by Kessinger Publishing of an 1899 essay with an introduction by Charles Morris, author of _The Aryan Race_.  This particular essay deals in the field of comparative religion, attempting to trace back all major Aryan religions to an original sun myth archetypal form.  According to the author, the Aryans originally occupied Central Asia, and their sun myth incorporated components of death, burial, and resurrection.  In addition, the sun was believed to have come from virgin birth (the astrological passage of the sign of Virgo), and primitive forms of baptism and eucharist were practised by these primitive peoples.  The author then moves into the field of comparative religion noting relationships between the ancient traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mithraism, the religions of Persia, ancient Teutonic religion, ancient Greek belief, ancient Egyptian religion, the religions of the American Indians, Aztecs, and Mayas, and early Christianity and Judaism.  In particular, relationships are found between the ancient gods of Crishna (an avatar of Visnu, part of the Hindu \\"trinity\\"), the Buddha, Mithras, Zoroaster, Odin and Thor, Hercules, Osiris and Isis, Quetzacoatl, and Jesus Christ.  The interrelationships between Crishna and Buddha and Christ are indeed stunning, when brought fully to light.  The author next discusses Christ in particular, and argues that his religionbore much similarity to that of the ancient Essenes.  (I believe the relationship between Christ and the Essenes is overdeveloped here, being a product of Nineteenth century thought it has turned out to be a similarity that has not born its expected fruit.)  The author notes how events from the life of Christ correspond to ancient aspects of primitive solar worship as well as to worship in the other ancient belief systems.  The author also mentions the use of the cross as special symbol, as well as the swastica (an ancient Buddhist symbol).  The book concludes with several appendices outlining some of the main features and similiarities between various components of the ancient myths. <br /> <br />Perhaps if we view these ancient beliefs as precursors to the divine Christ it is possible to understand the immense similiarities that existed between ancient cultures.  In particular, it is now apparent that a global ancient civilization existed on earth before the modern era, and that the same archetypal forms were expressed in common among all cultures.  This book provides an interesting discussion of some of these issues.  <br />	2004-12-09

As explained in a previous book _The Servile State_, Belloc contrasts three separate forms society may come to take:  that of the servile state, that of communism, and that of the proprietary state (or distributism).  Belloc explains this as follows:  \\"There is a third form of society, and it is the only one in which sufficiency and security can be combined with freedom, and that form is a society in which property is well distributed and so large a proportion of families in the state severally OWN and therefore control the means of production as to determine the general tone of society; making it neither Capitalist nor Communist, but Proprietary.\\"  Distributism arose as a response to the excesses of industrial capitalism in which many families had been ruined, and the vast majority of the population was reduced to the level of wage slaves.  In contradistinction to communism, distributism allowed for the maintenance of private property (communism basically reducing all individuals to the status of slaves to the state).  In the Middle Ages, the serfs were at least allowed to own the means of production and made use of them through a guild system.  With the breakdown of medieval society and the decline of Christendom, property was seized by the capitalist class.  Belloc makes the analogy that it is necessary to achieve a restoration of property in the same manner as it is necessary to achieve a re-afforestation of barren land.  In order to do this, Belloc offers several proposals, including the return to a guild system as well a system of taxation on large businesses which operate at the expense of the small businessman.  Belloc's theories along with those of his fellow writer G. K. Chesterton, both published in the periodical _The New Age_ by Alfred Richard Orage, continued in the line of Catholic social teachings which arose as a response to the excesses of industrial capitalism and the dangers of communism in the beginning of the modern era.	2004-12-08

Father Seraphim (Eugene) Rose began his career as a student interested in Eastern religion and studied under Alan Watts and the Taoist philosopher Gi-ming Shien.  Later, Father Rose was to develop an interest in the Traditionalist school of thought founded by Rene Guenon, and subsequently he was to make his spiritual home within the traditions of Eastern Orthodox Christianity.  He became both a monk and a priest and lived at the Saint Herman of Alaska monastery.  This book begins by examining various modern day interpretations of the after death experience.  These include descriptions from both medical and occult literature that present the reader with depictions of a \\"summerland\\" paradise in which dead relatives appear as well as out of body experiences immediately after death.  In addition, beings of light (interpreted by occultists and many modern day scientists) as angels (or even Christ Himself) are often seen in near death experiences.  Father Seraphim Rose discusses both scientific and occult literature, including particularly the writings of Raymond Moody, Emanuel Swedenborg, Carl Jung, and the _Tibetan Book of the Dead_.  Father Rose also reveals the dangers of spiritism involving contact with the dead.  In contrast to much of this literature, which he believes has been misinterpreted, Father Rose presents the traditional Orthodox teaching on the soul's journey after death.  This involves both out of body experiences, upon the soul's separation from the body, as well as the soul's travel through aerial toll houses.  At these aerial toll houses the soul is met by demons who attempt to cause the dead to despair by presenting them with their sins and temptations; thereby, making them lose their salvation.  It is only after passing through these trials that the soul finally meets withthe particular judgment.  Father Rose notes that this view is far less rosy than that presented by modern day after death literature.  However, this can be explained in terms of the general malaise of the modern world.  In a world which refuses to recognize tradition, it is only to be expected that the interpretation placed on after death experiences will not be a traditional one and therefore may result in grave danger to the soul after death.  Father Rose contrasts this view in particular with the Protestant viewpoint in which heaven and hell are perceived in a much more static way.  In addition, many Protestants believe that they can know that they are saved in this life, and that once known their salvation cannot be lost.  I believe this to be a form of Gnosticism in which Knowledge is made to take priority over Faith.  Father Rose also contrasts his perspective with that of Catholicism in that he denies the existence of purgatory and the \\"purifying fire\\".  Here, I disagree with him, in that I believe the existence of purgatory to be an essential component of the tradition.  Much of Father Rose's understanding of the after death experience is taken from the writings of various Russian Orthodox saints including Saint Theodora and from the writings of Bishop Ignatius Brianchaninov and the book _Eternal Mysteries Beyond the Grave_.  In addition, Father Rose provides some good advice for what can be done to lessen the travails of the dead upon their departure from this world.  Unlike Protestants who frequently argue that one should never pray for the dead, Father Rose notes the importance of praying for the dead, and that indeed this prayer can help in their salvation.  Unfortunately, much that is presented by Father Rose in this book is speculative and is not to be seen as rigorous dogma.  Indeed, there remains some confusion among the Orthodox as to whether or not the idea of the aerial toll houses is heretical, indeed Gnostic.  Included in this book are several appendices, as well as a letter to a critic which tries to address some of the confusion resulting from the doctrine of the toll houses.  I believe that the toll houses are not an article of faith, but should remain as speculation informing the soul's state after death.	2004-12-05

Previously it had been believed that Nietzsche's amoralistic thinking had played a larger role in the development of Hitler's Third Reich.  However, as Viereck shows in this book, it was indeed Wagner who was the antisemite (and one of the most virulent antisemites even prior to the coming of Hitler).      This edition put out by Transaction publishers of _Metapolitics_ is expanded not only to cover the influence of German Romanticism on Hitler (which preceded Wagner himself), but also to include a new introduction and several appendices on Albert Speer (Hitler's architect of the Third Reich), Count Claus von Stauffenberg (the aristocrat who tried to assassinate Hitler), the poet George Heym, and the poet Stefan George and his circle.    In the letters of Richard Wagner is included a letter from an admirer and ardent nationalist which states:  \\"To be genuinely German, politics must soar to metapolitics.  The latter is to commonplace pedestrian politics as metaphysics is to physics.\\"  Metapolitics as defined by Viereck is the type of political thought serving as inspiration for Hitler and his Third Reich regime.    The book begins with a discussion of German Romanticism and its influence on Hitler.  For Viereck, the Third Reich may be perceived in some sense as German Romanticism writ large.  The book also discusses the influence of \\"Father\\" Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, a German nationalist in the 1800's, on the storm troopers and on Volkish nationalism in general.  The book next moves on to discussing the case of Wagner.  Many of Wagner's operatic pieces can be seen as allegories for different components of his metapolitical thinking.  For example, it has been suggested that certain characters (the dwarves and the dragon) represent capitalists or Jews within his operas.  The book subsequently discusses Houston Stewart Chamberlain whose racialist tracts served as inspiration for Hitler.  Also, the book includes several chapters on Alfred Rosenberg, the official Nazi philosopher.  Rosenberg was also influenced by German Romanticism and his understanding of history proved particularly virulent.  Viereck opposed Christian morality to Rosenberg's neo-paganism.    In sum, this book presents an interesting discussion of some of the precursors of the Third Reich.  Both German Romanticism and Richard Wagner played a large part in the development of the thinking of Hitler, and also in many of his primary proponents and Nazi fellow travelers.	2004-12-04

De Gobineau was a French aristocrat and racialist who had an influence on Richard Wagner and is believed to be a proto-Nazi theorist.  Like Nietzsche, de Gobineau took a rather grim view of religion as a civilizing influence and argued against \\"slave-morality\\".  This book expounds his racial theories.  The book begins by making the case that racial differences can in fact explain differences in civilization and achievement.  De Gobineau argues that neither luxury, effeminacy, misgovernment, fanaticism, nor the corruption of morals is responsible for the decline and destruction of states, civilizations, and peoples, but that instead the mixing of the blood leads to this decline.  De Gobineau also argues in a series of successive chapters that racial inequalities are not the result of institutions, the regions in which one lives, or the civilizing influence of Christianity.  He then proceeds to outline a series of comparisons between races and explains the differences between civilizations.  De Gobineau argues that the white race is more capable of achieving great civilization than either the yellow or the black race, and he explains various intermixtures of these three races.  The Aryan influence on high culture cannot be denied, and de Gobineau explains his theory of Aryan supremacy.  For de Gobineau, there exist a male and female element within the blood.  The male element constitutes a \\"material current\\" (Purusha), and the female element constitutes an \\"intellectual current\\" (Prakriti).  De Gobineau then goes on to place different races into each of these two categories, placing the Chinese first among the male category and the Hindus first among the female category.  De Gobineau also discusses differences between beauty and languages among the races.De Gobineau argues that the races are intellectually unequal and that different civilizations are mutually repulsive.  De Gobineau ends this book with a recapitulation of the differences between black, yellow, and white races, noting the superiority of the white race and the Aryan family within that race.  He also includes a section outlining the great civilizations and their achievements.	2004-11-23

Although at first Germany was not united, philosophy came to take on a unique German flavor, often meaning little more than the opaqueness of the language.  For a generation of disenfranchised youth, Goethe captured the spirit of the times in his novel (with mistranslated title), _The Sorrows of Young Werther_.  The first part of this book deals with the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who created a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophical thought with the writing of his three _Critiques_.  Kant provided the foundation that many youth of the period were seeking in terms of philosophical thought.  The second part of this book deals with post-Kantians, many of them founders of the Romantic movement, who took off from Kant's philosophy in the _Critiques_.  Two issues played a central role for these early post-Kantian figures, one being the French Revolution and the other being the issue of Spinoza's pantheism (and alleged atheism).  Two early individuals involved in the controversy over Spinoza were Jacobi, who argued against both Kant and Spinoza and is often associated with a dark kind of irrationalism, and Reinhold who defended Kant against these claims in the 1780s.  In the 1790s, Fichte came to play an important role in philosophy, extending the thought of Kant with a form of subjectivism in his _Wissenschaftslehre_.  The 1790s also witnessed the Romantic appropriation of Kantianism.  Many of these early Romantics wrote for the journal _Athenaum_.  These included the poets Holderlin and Novalis, the Protestant theologian of sentimentalism Schleiermacher, the brothers Schlegel who wrote in fragments, and the philosopher Schelling.  Originally Schelling came to embrace Spinoza; however, later in his career he would become more conservative and reject him while explicitly defending Christian revelation.  In addition, Jacob Fries played some role as a non-Romantic philosopher who appropriated Kant.  The third part of this book deals strictly with Hegel.  Hegel's _Phenomenology of Spirit_ provided an early groundwork for his _Encyclopedia_ and _Logic_.  The book also covers some of Hegel's later lectures including his _Philosophy of Right_.  Finally, the fourth part of this book deals with the revolution in question.  This includes sections on Schelling's attempts at restoration in the second half of his career and on the philosophers Schopenhauer (a radical pessimist) and Kierkegaard (an early Danish existentialist).  Finally, Hegel's philosophy was turned on its head and idealism abandoned for materialism in the writings of the Left Hegelians (who became increasingly radical) including such figures as Feuerbach, Marx, and Engels.  This book gives an excellent introduction to German philosophy during a crucial period of years.  Mostly this philosophy reflects the influence of Kant as well as the spirit of the times in which large sections of the youth and intelligentsia felt abandoned and left to pursue a life of autonomy.	2004-10-10

Belloc argues that the Jews are an alien body in the society in which they live and must be understood as such, the problem not being denied, and their cohesiveness being understood for what it is.  In order to examine the causes of friction, Belloc takes a look at both anti-semitism and the Jewish role within both capitalism and as a source of revolutionary Bolshevism.  Indeed, the founder of communism, Karl (Mordecai) Marx was of Jewish extraction and many of its earliest followers were Jews.  This source of instability has led to the extreme opposite response among Gentiles, that of anti-semitism, taking its most extreme form in Nazism.  Belloc also examines the phenomenon of Zionism as well as the concerns that go with the founding of a Jewish state in Palestine, involving the native Arab population there.  Various theories have been proposed to explain the Jewish presence, including those involving Biblical accounts of the Jews in the time of Christ.  Belloc expounds on these theories for a while and shows how some of them are problematic in themselves.  The large percentage of Jews involved in usury is also shown, something that was outlawed in Biblical society.  Belloc was a unique historian who presented a perspective opposed to the dominant Anglo-American perspective on the Reformation as well as a political alternative to both the excesses of capitalism and the evils of socialism, which he termed distributism.	2004-10-10

Tradition is characterized by a recognition of transcendence and hierarchy as opposed to the mass levelling which has taken place in modernity - at root in nihilism.  Evola, a gloomy figure on the marginalized radical right in postwar Italy, writes of the modern world as witnessing a new dark age, the Kali Yuga of Indian tradition (as noted by the father of Traditionalism, Rene Guenon).  In the philosophy of Traditionalism, the world is said to have fallen from a past Golden Age (as witnessed to by the ancient Greeks, Hesiod, and the Hindus) and approaching the end of a cycle has entered the Kali Yuga, an era characterized by dissolution.  Kali is a dark goddess of sexuality and orgiastic rites in Hindu mythology - said to be asleep in previous eras but in the Kali Yuga said to be wide awake.  The modern age is characterized by the \\"death of God\\" (the end of the transcendent), the beginning of European nihilism as explained by Nietzsche.  In such a world, the spiritual type Evola writes for is totally alienated.  Topics covered in this book include Nietzsche's philosophy and the world in which \\"God is dead\\", the \\"lost youth\\" and the postwar generation of Beatniks, the dead end of existentialist philosophies, Heideggerianism and Husserlian phenomenologies, the new physics and scientism, moral decline, an excursus on drugs, the failure of modern art, sexuality and marriage, the \\"new religiosity, and death.  Evola finds little to recommend for his ideal type except for a sort of neo-Gnostic complete withdrawal from the modern world characterized by what he terms \\"apolitea\\".  In terms of Tradition, little remains left to recognize and hierarchy has been completely abolished.  This form of apolitea may be described as \\"riding the tiger\\", a Far Eastern saying meaning that if one succeeds in riding a tiger not only does one avoid having to leap on one, but one may eventually get the better of it.  This is Evola's only recommendation for coming to terms with modernity and making one's way across the Kali Yuga that completes the traditional cycle.  As in his previous book _Revolt Against the Modern World_, Evola offers many profound insights into both the nature of modernity and the means for achieving counter-revolution giving the prevailing winds of the time.s \\"riding the tiger\\", a Far Eastern saying meaning that if one succeeds in riding a tiger not only does one avoid having to leap on one, but one may eventually get the better of it.

For one thing there is the abuse of the term \\"fundamentalism\\".  Fundamentalism properly understood refers to a group of Protestant Christians who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible which must be interpreted literally.  Jews and Muslims do not refer to themselves as fundamentalists.  Secondly, the book is rather poorly written and contains quite a bit of left wing goofiness, which distracts from an otherwise interesting subject matter.  The issue of intolerance among religious Jews in Israel is particularly disturbing.  This book details much of that level of intolerance, particularly for the Palestinian population living in the land of Israel, but also for Gentiles in general and fellow Jews deemed heretics.  Perhaps the most famous case of persecution of heresy among religious Jews is that of the philosopher Baruch (Benedict, Latinized) Spinoza who was excommunicated for going against the rabbinate.  The authors try to make the claim that similar occurrences have happened throughout history (see _Jewish History, Jewish Religion_ by Israel Shahak) and continue to happen in Israel dominated by religious forces.  The authors spend a great deal of time discussing various political parties including the Haredim and Gush Emunim.  The conflict between secular Jews and the orthodox and ultra-orthodox sects becomes apparent in such issues as the conscription of Israeli youth to the military, where those studying for the rabbinate do not have to participate and are supported by the state.  An even more radical viewpoint is expressed by the followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who moved to Israel from New York.  Kahane advocated a radical form of Jewish supremacism and racism, basing his chauvinistic views on the arrogant myth of \\"the chosen\\".  One follower of Kahane took his views seriously and gunned down a group of Arabs praying in a mosque at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, Baruch Goldstein.  The authors show how the Jewish response to the Goldstein rampage was less than honest, many outright supporting what Goldstein had done.  The authors also discuss the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was perceived as a moderate willing to concede lands to the Arabs by the Israeli \\"far right\\".  Another disturbing issue involves religious idolatry of the Temple Mount, on which sits a mosque which many claim must be destroyed to bring about the Messiah.  (An interesting discussion of this issue in full and how it relates to Christian evangelicals may be found in the book _The End of Days_ by Gershom Gorenberg.)  In sum, this book brings up some disturbing issues about the political parties in the land of Israel and should not be dismissed as mere \\"anti-Semitism\\".	2004-10-03

As a philosophy/theology, Traditionalism has its origins in several diverse sources all existing at the end of the Nineteenth century, which were contextualized and synthesized by Rene Guenon and later others.  One central tenet of Traditionalism is that all of the world's traditions issue from the same source (a divine source) and can be found to be universally present across all ancient cultures, a philosophical view termed perennialism.  The origins of perennialism can be traced to ancient times; however, perennialism witnessed a revival and codification during the Rennaissance period in which the wisdom of the ancient Greeks and the classical world was revived and combined with traditional religions (Christianity or Islam) under such figures as the Roman Catholic priest Marsilio Ficino.  The origins of Traditionalism proper can be traced to various occult circles (around such figures as Papus, for example) and systems of Eastern wisdom and tradition.  Indeed, for Traditionalists (and in particular for the early Guenon) the East represented an important and viable traditionalist alternative to the decadent modernist West which had been overcome by materialism and scientism.  Rene Guenon (perhaps the founder and central figure of this movement) remains an enigmatic individual, crossing the spectrum from occult studies and freemasonic lodges, to traditionalist Roman Catholicism, and eventually making his home with the Islamic religion (in particular its Sufi tradition).  However, Guenon also wrote about Hinduism (his earliest works being studies of Hindu doctrines and the Vedanta philosophy) and Taoism (under the influence of his friend Albert de Pouvourville).  Guenon came to regard religious practice as an essential component of his worldview, causing him to emphasize initiation into a given tradition (either masonic or Sufi Islam, preferably), and eventually his conversion to Islam (although his apparent orthodoxy remains somewhat questionable).  Certain followers of Guenon would also try to set up a system of initiation within Christianity (possibly to avoid conversion to Islam) under the Roman Catholic antiquarian Louis Charbonneau-Lassay who headed an order referred to as the Knights of the Divine Paraclete.  Guenon, who was born a Frenchman, would eventually come to make his home in Cairo, where he lived as a devout Muslim until his death.  Towards the end of his life, Guenon came to fear what he believed to be \\"counter-initiatic forces\\" which he had argued against in his writings.  Other figures who took off from Guenon but remained steadfast to the Traditionalist movement include Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon.  Coomaraswamy served as a museum curator who incorporated the perennial philosophy into his studies dealing with traditionalist Hinduism and Buddhism and their artforms.  Frithjof Schuon became a second convert to Islam, inaugurating his own Sufi sect the Maryamiyya, under the inspiration of the Virgin Mary.  Schuon came to advocate a universalist view of religion (calling for a Transcendent Unity of religious traditions, at an esoteric level), eventually moving to America and adopting practices of the Native Americans in his ritual.  Schuon's Maryamiyya Sufi order drew the attention of many notables including such figures as the Roman Catholic monk Thomas Merton, the religious scholar Huston Smith, and the Islamicist and Traditionalist Seyyed Hossein Nasr.  Nasr, who was a student at MIT when he became acquainted with Traditionalism, came to reject the scientistic worldview prevalent there and embrace Islam.  Nasr later moved back to his native country of Iran where he founded an Imperial Academy underthe Shah, which was to survive until after the Khomeinian revolution, for the study of traditional Islam.  Other figures involved with the Marayamiyyas of Schuon include Titus Burckhardt and Martin Lings, both of whom wrote extensively on Islam and Traditionalism.  Traditionalism came to take on a political bent in the Italian counter-revolutionary rightist Baron Julius Evola.  Evola's most famous work _Revolt Against the Modern World_ argued for complete reaction against modernity.  Evola would later come to tentatively support Mussolini as well as writing on racialism and Hitler's SS.  During the postwar period, Evola would come to advocate an abandonment of political activism proper in what he termed apolitea.  Many of his followers in postwar Italy on the extreme right and left came to embrace terrorism against the subsequent bourgeois state.  An interesting figure who played some role in the formation of the early Nazi party is that of Rudolf von Sebottendorf.  Sebottendorf was influenced by occultism and the Kabbalah as well as Sufi Islam and came to play a principal role in the Germanen-Orden which became the NSDAP (subsequently seized by Hitler and his cronies).  Evola's writings also influenced the young Romanian religious scholar Mircea Eliade, who would come to play such an important role in the modern academic compartmentalization of religious studies despite his youthful dabblings in Romanian fascism.  Another political Traditionalist influenced by Evola is the Russian pan-Eurasian National Bolshevik Alexander Dugin.  Other aspects of this book focus on the role of Traditionalism within Russia and the Islamic world in particular.  The author seems to focus particularly on Islam, as opposed to Catholicism and Christianity, perhaps because this is the area of his specialty.  The author also examines other figures who he terms \\"soft\\" Traditionalists who though influenced by Traditionalism would not come to fully embrace this philosophy.  In sum, this bookserves as a very good introduction to the subject of Traditionalism, is expertly footnoted, and is sure to serve as a stepping stone for further research.	2004-10-03

Scales were developed to assess Antisemitism, Political-Economic Conservativism (which amounted to support for laissez-faire capitalism), and Authoritarianism (the F (for Fascist) scale).  Both the Antisemitism scale and the Political-Economic Conservativism scale involved predictable statements in which the subjects had to state their level of agreement with in order to achieve a score.  The F scale, involved a series of statements which were designed to measure conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (i.e. \\"Opposition to the subjective, the imaginative, and the tender-minded.\\"), superstition and stereotypy, power and \\"toughness\\", destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity (i.e. \\"The disposition to believe that wild and dangerous things go on in the world\\"), and concern about \\"sexual goings-on\\".  While some of these statements were predictable, others were rather strange (and could not be easily answered in terms of Agree/Disagree because they were too broad and categorical).  (My own score on this scale was rather high, about 4 out of a possible 6.)  Various populations including college students and criminals were examined in terms of these scales and various theories were proposed to explain different personality sub-types.  The ironic thing about this research is that it does not really show much of anything.  While the authoritarian type may be interesting from a theoretical perspective, it is doubtful that such a type actually amounts to the kind of person who would unleash a fascist tyranny.  In my view, the authoritarian type would be a rather eccentric individual, but probably not one who would engage in mass murder.  This study must be seen in light of the fact that among the main authors were Marxists (prime among them Theodore Adorno) who wanted to advance an anticonservative agenda, downplaying conventional morality among other things.  Also, the authors seem to think that those prone to give a \\"mystical\\" explanation for world events are also those prone to be sympathetic to a fascist state.  I find this ironic because in my view the fascist state was a completely technicized one, created along \\"rationalist\\"/scientistic lines.  I believe this reveals the bias of the Marxist materialist against philosophical worldviews which incorporate transcendental non-material elements.  Also, in terms of stereotypy it is assumed that the stereotypes in question are always false.  While stereotypes may reveal a dysfunction in rational thought, there is no reason to assume that a stereotype need be always false.  Actual empirical study is necessary to confirm or disconfirm the truth of a given stereotype, provided of course that that stereotype is even phrased in a manner which leads itself to verification/falsification.  Finally, it is assumed that conventional morality is something that involves submission to an unjust authority, rather than being a natural outgrowth of biological and natural constraints upon the human animal.  Since these sorts of questions were not addressed in the study, I believe that while it may be interesting from some theoretical perspective, its practical utility is limited.  In terms of actual practice, the results of this study could be disastrous, in fact resulting in a sort of \\"reverse tyranny\\" in which individuals categorized as \\"authoritarian\\" by such measures are denied civil liberties.  A good book which deals with this question is by Paul Gottfried entitled _After Liberalism:  Mass Democracy in the Managerial State_.  In addition, much of the theorizing in this book is based on Freudian theories of the unconscious.  These types of Freudian theories are highly problematic in themselves, and their scientific standing is highly dubious to say the least.  Many of the individuals interviewed in this book could clearly be described as unbalanced and possibly insane; however, there is little reason to think that these are the individuals who would be at the forefront of a future fascism.	2004-10-02

It has always seemed to me probable . . . that there would be a resurrection of Islam and that our sons or our grandsons would see the renewal of that tremendous struggle between the Christian culture and what has been for more than a thousand years its greatest opponent. <br />     -Hilaire Belloc. <br /> <br />_Where the Right Went Wrong_ is Patrick Buchanan's critique of the neoconservative Bush regime from the perspective of a populist, nationalist conservative.  Buchanan's political beliefs include elements of isolationism, protectionism of U.S. manufacturers, restriction of foreign immigration, and cultural traditional conservativism.  It is in terms of interventionist wars to instate \\"global democracy\\" and free trade economic policy where Buchanan's brand of conservativism differs most from the Bush neoconservatives.  Buchanan is also highly critical of Israel and asks some difficult questions concerning U.S. foreign aid as well as the war against Iraq, which he argues may have been fought to protect Zionist interests.  Indeed, Buchanan portrays the president as an easy dupe to Jewish neoconservatives who will sell his own conservative principles out to the gods of global economy and interventionism for Israel and \\"worldwide global democracy\\", the New World Order.  Buchanan shows how the idea of global democracy is certainly not a conservative one but actually has its origins in the French Revolution.  Thus, the neoconservatives may be perceived as the new Jacobins.  Buchanan is distinctively nationalist in terms of trade.  He wants protectionist tariffs to help protect U.S. manufacturing from unfair foreign competition (tariffs were strongly advocated by the nationalist economist Friedrich List who argued that free trade was being used by Britain to cripple the American colonies), and wants NAFTA and other such trade agreements abolished.  (On this particular issue, Buchanan differs from other right wing libertarians who are entirely pro-free trade, althoughthey may not have supported NAFTA because it created too much of a bureaucracy.)  Buchanan also wants restrictions on foreign immigration (particularly from Mexico, where immigrants continue to flood the U.S. climbing over its borders illegally), which has caused leftists to brand him as a \\"nativist\\", an issue which neither political party Republican nor Democrat seems willing to touch, despite popular support for restrictions by the American people.  Buchanan believes that for the republic's survival it is necessary to maintain a manufacturing based economy (in order to achieve a level of self sufficiency); however, with jobs being outsourced overseas the economy is becoming service based.  These service based jobs do not offer the same benefits or pay for the American worker as manufacturing jobs once did, leading to calls for state health insurance benefits among others.  Thus, Buchanan has a dim perspective seeing America as quickly sliding towards the level of a Third World country, the way of all empires.  In terms of the war, Buchanan sees this as an unnecessary provocation of radical Islam.  Calls for another crusade against the Islamic hordes would result in devastating levels of destruction.  However, the so called \\"War on Terror\\" makes it highly unclear who exactly war has been declared on.  Indeed, many radical evangelicals and Zionists believe just that, that war has been declared on all of Islam.  In terms of cultural conservativism and traditional morality, Buchanan shows the dim prospects that have developed.  Families have been broken apart, abortion, euthanasia, human cloning, and other abominations remain legal, the gay rights issue remains open with Massachusetts legalizing homosexual marriage, and the influence of religion and love for God and country has diminished.  Part of this can be blamed on the Supreme Court which continues to decide issues in the culture war against the interests of the American people.  Neoconservatives frequently ignore these issues, seeing that they believe the war in Iraq is more important.  This coming election will present the American people with two weak candidates.  Bush will continue the war, pay lip service to cultural conservativism, but continue to increase government spending.  Kerry will also continue the war, will flip flop on moral issues claiming to be a Catholic but a leftist too somehow, and also increase government spending.  Some conservatives, marginalized by the Republican party, have broken off and decided to vote for third parties such as the Constitution Party or the Libertarian Party; however neither of these alternatives seem very appealing as they are unable to offer anything more than a protest against the current regime, for the time being anyway.  It's ironic too that Buchanan seems to enjoy some popularity among leftists for writing this book.  These leftists are particularly stupid I think because they stand for the opposite of what he stands for on every issue.  <br />	2004-09-29

Othmar Spann was a conservative Austrian economist who espoused a theory of a corporate state who was briefly imprisoned by the Nazis.  Spann was known for his radical anti-liberal and anti-socialist views, and attempted to incorporate these views into his corporate ideal largely aligning himself with German Romanticists who had preceded him.  This book provides a good introduction to the thought of Spann and shows the contrast between his \\"universalist\\" economic ideal and the \\"individualist\\" ideal espoused both by classical economists of a liberal bent and to some extent by socialists (although socialists would incorporate some universalist elements, but ultimately fail in their attempt).  This book by Spann outlined a history of economic theory beginning with classical thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle, moving through the medieval period including the Scholastics (especially Saint Thomas Aquinas), moving into the mercantilist period and the subsequent breakdown of mercantilism through the individualist \\"natural right\\".  This branch of thinking culminated in the \\"physiocrats\\" and eventually the classical individualism of such thinkers as Adam Smith and Ricardo (with arguments for \\"free trade\\").  Spann contrasts these thinkers to various German Romanticists, particularly Adam Muller, Franz von Baader, Thunen, and others who argued for a corporate state (suggesting that the moral basis for the market was left out in thinkers such as Smith).  Spann's book provides one of the few places where the thinking of these men is fully espoused and worked out.  In particular, Spann seems drawn to the thought of Adam Muller, a conservative German Catholic who proposed a corporativist state in an attempt to restore a medieval hierarchical society.  In his discussion of the German economic thinkers, the thought of Friedrich List (a nationalist who advocated protectionist tariffs) also plays some importance for Spann.  By contrast to these thinkers, Spann shows how the economicviewpoint of socialism (whether in its \\"prescientific\\" or \\"scientific\\" forms, the words are from Marx) ultimately is aligned with an individualist conception.  Spann also briefly discusses National Socialism, the theories of Gottfried Feder, who was to play some part in the formation of the NSDAP.  Finally, Spann turns his attention to the historical school of economic thought and modern economic theory.  Interesting contrasts include those regarding the nature of money, between metalists and chartalists.  Spann's views marked a near mystical turn for economic theory (much in line with the mysticism of German medieval monastic Meister Eckhart, who Spann admired), and he was persecuted for them although his ideas may have been in some alignment with the zeitgeist of the times during interwar Germany.  This book offers an interesting introduction to various economic theories and attempts to outline Spann's own viewpoint of \\"universalism\\" contrasting it to the \\"individualism\\" present in both neo-liberalism and Socialist economic theories.	2004-09-28

The authors note how this movement consists of several different, sometimes discordant, features.  These include libertarianism and individualism (often carried out to extremes) which emphasizes anti-statism and resistance to the welfare/managerial state of the post New Deal era as well as isolationism as a general principle.  This philosophy originally upheld by certain segments of the \\"Old Right\\" rose to prominence with the publication of Friedrich Hayek's book _The Road to Serfdom_ which argued against the controlled economy.  In addition, certain segments of the original conservative movement were traditionalist in aspect, often composed of Catholics or Anglo-Catholics, and advocates of traditional morality, religion, and classical literature.  Traditionalists including Russell Kirk and Richard Weaver as well as a whole host of Southern agrarians played an important part in shaping the philosophy of conservativism (rooting it in the writings of Edmund Burke or in Platonic philosophy or neo-Thomism under the influence of Aristotle).  These two aspects of the conservative movement were combined in the early years of the journal _National Review_ put out by William F. Buckley.  Buckley's journal maintained a virulently anti-communist stance (Buckley at one time wrote an apologetic piece for Joseph McCarthy) and advocated an interventionist foreign policy against communist tyranny.  However, as the authors note, conservativism came to lose sway in the universities as the original mentors of the right abandoned their posts for more practical endeavors.  With the social unrest during the Sixties, conservativism completely lost hold of academia which was abandoned to social protest and subsequently political correctness.  While certain parts of academia, especially including key areas of the social sciences which lend themselves to an hereditarian interpretation (as opposed to environmentalist), may be interpreted in a conservative manner, those who have discovered these key features of the human animal have been almost unanimously shunned.  The authors then note how conservativism subsequently underwent a split, possibly brought about by conflicting elements within its philosophy and the decline of the Soviet empire.  On the one hand, a new brand of \\"conservative\\", remnants from the Old Left who no longer upheld the radical tendencies of the newer Left, came to the fore.  This was the neoconservative, a primarily Jewish sect centered in New York, but which subsequently came to take hold of the Republican Party.  Alternatively, a more populist approach was advocated by those on the New Right, composed almost entirely of Evangelical Christians (with some Catholics) and focusing almost completely on single issues, such as abortion, homosexual rights, feminism, education, and the family.  Both of these were opposed by members of the remaining \\"Old Right\\" who came to be known as \\"paleoconservatives\\", in contrast to the newer conservative upcomers.  One stark contrast between these two brands of conservative concerns matters of foreign policy, where many paleoconservatives continue to advocate a more isolationist stance, while neoconservatives call for a \\"global democratic revolution\\".  The authors show how the influence of neoconservativism came to play a role in the two prominent conservative politicians of the era, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.  This book is somewhat dated, being originally written in the late 80s and since that time the difference between various \\"conservatives\\" has widened.  Particularly difficult remains the necessity of hammering out the various contradictions within the conservative movement.  For example, the libertarian element (advocating laissez faire free market capitalism and anti-statism) seems opposed to the more populist brand of conservativism (whose economic platform can often approach that of socialism) which seems at odds with the elitism innate to the traditionalist and classical brands of conservativism.  It remains unclear how these contradictions in the movement can be ironed out.  In sum, however this book remains a good introduction to the conservative movement, written from a particular point of view sympathetic towards the \\"Old Right\\".	2004-09-03

The book examines many sources, mostly idealistic and utopian in nature, from philosophers and writers, as well as a great deal of the science fiction and fantasy type novels that proliferated during the rise of the Third Reich.  The book also provides an excellent collection of pictures, including detailed drawings by National Socialist fellow travellers, Volkish utopians, and Romantic Teutonic dreamers, which make this book quite unique.  This book shows how those within the Volkish movement beginning in the Nineteenth century and culminating after the defeat in the First World War, calling for a Third Reich, were nave dreamers and utopians, whose viewpoints were ruthlessly exploited by the opportunists within the upper echelons of the NSDAP proper, and Hitler himself.  The book also traces out the background of Hitler and shows precisely which aspects of Volkish ideology and utopian theorizing were to play an influence on him as he grew in power after commandeering the reigns of the NSDAP.  It should be noted that pastoralist and utopian dreams frequently became replaced by purely technocratic and Social Darwinist ideologies as soon as Hitler came to power.  The book includes a vast amount of detail beginning with early calls for a socialised utopia by Fichte (and other philosophers) in the spirit of the French Revolution as well as along the lines of those laid out by Tacitus in his _Germania_ (the society of the primitive Germanic tribes), to calls for a restored kingdom (under a great ruler (Der Furher) - a supposed revival of that of Friedrich the Great), to the ideas of various \\"Aryanosophists\\" and pan-German nationalists (early preludes to the NSDAP) such as Guido von List, to the calls for \\"conservative revolution\\" by those \\"leftists on the right\\" such as Ernst Junger and Oswald Spengler, to the bizarre theories of Hans Horbiger (believed in by Hitler himself) regarding a global age of ice (made popular by the novelist Edmund Kiss), to the ideas of the Land Reform movement of Volkish idealists calling for a move towards the East and emphasizing the agricultural ways of the old Teuton, as well as beliefs in a primitive Teutonic matriarchy needed to achieve breeding towards the superior race, to the ideas of Hitler himself.  This book makes available literature that has not become available in any other place, much of it destroyed after the war (or suppressed during the Third Reich by Hitler as heretical, an apostasy from official Third Reich propaganda).  The book also includes material made available during the Second World War regarding the superiority of the German race and nation, much of it science fiction literature (often extreme in both its racism and anti-Semitism).  For containing all this information, mostly discarded by other historians who will not touch upon the irrational elements behind the Third Reich, this book is to be highly recommended.	2004-08-25

The book also covers to some extent the beliefs of the other third in the triangle of great monotheistic religions in the Middle East, that of the Islamic millenialists, as well as including some discussion of other millenial groups, various cults, and individuals influenced by the hysteria brought on from the beginning of year 2000 (and the alleged Y2K computer virus).  The book details the insanity of many of those who believe that it is necessary to restore the Temple of Solomon in order to bring about the End of Days (either according to the Christian revelation involving the Second Coming of Christ or according to the Jewish belief in the coming of a messiah).  Unfortunately, for those who hold this belief (including many fundamentalist Christians in America) the fact is that currently a Muslim mosque occupies the space where allegedly the Temple existed.  This has caused many extremists (both Jewish Zionists and Christians) to call for the destruction of this mosque through explosion or whatever other means necessary.  The potential political disaster that would result from such an event occurring within the geopolitical hotbed of Jerusalem (currently home to the world's greatest conflict between Israeli occupants and Palestinian militants) is unfathomable.  Certainly the destruction of the mosque Al-Aqsa could very well bring about the Third World War.  Much of this book is spent detailing the beliefs of various groups of Zionist zealots (both Christian and Jewish) with names such as the Temple Mount Faithful who operate outside of the law in their attempt to restore the Temple.  Restoring the Temple involves the return of animal sacrifice to the Jewish religion as well as a particular concern for breeding a red heifer.  It is believed that no man can enter the Temple unless he has not had contact with any corpse (thereby eliminating nearly all but selectively raised boys) or unless he has been smeared with the ashes of a red heifer (in alignment with the Book of Numbers 19).  The effective cloning of such a red heifer could spell disaster if these individuals were to decide that the time to restore the Temple had come and the mosque must be overtaken by force.  For many Protestant Christian fundamentalists, the restoration of the Temple and the return of the Jews to their homeland (effectively the establishment of the state of Israel) involves the playing out of key events from the Book of Revelation.  In addition, it is believed that once the End has come all Christian believers (particularly by those of the \\"born again\\" stripe) will be summoned up into the skies according to the teaching of the Rapture.  This unbiblical belief made popular by the premillenialist dispensationalist preacher John Darby in the nineteenth century has seen a recent revival.  In particular one can note the widespread sale of the notorious _Left Behind_ series of books which details a world caught up in the Tribulation (after all Christian believers have been \\"raptured\\").  In effect, the Rapture amounts to one of the greatest escapist fantasies ever developed, particularly because post-Rapture a great Tribulation will occur involving the Reign of Antichrist (in which many of the Jews will be either forced to convert or die) before the Second Coming of Christ.  Oddly, these fundamentalists have joined various Jewish zealots who believe that the restoration of the Temple is necessary to achieve the coming of the Messiah and the triumph of the nation of Israel (despite their apparent theological differences).  One group that is not mentioned in this account are the Freemasons, many of whom also believe that it is necessary to restore the Temple, supposedly built by their founder Hiram Abiff.  The author also mentions various apocalyptic beliefs popular among many Islamics including the belief in the rise of al-Dajjal (the Antichrist) who must be defeated by a returned Jesus, as well as a special prophet called the Mahdi, to show just how volatile the political situation is.  More disturbing still, certain Jewish fanatics have taken these beliefs to heart and tried to put them into action by murdering Islamic worshippers.  Such is the case of Baruch Goldstein, a fanatical follower of the Jewish supremacist (racist) Rabbi Meir Kahane, who gunned down a group of Muslims at prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs.  With the approach of the millenium, the Israeli government took action against many of those deemed potential threats (such as for instance various eccentrics including an individual referring to himself as Elijah who was deported) without provocation.  The author notes that much of this action is misguided, both because it denies liberty to individuals who may have bizarre beliefs and especially in light of the incident at Waco in the U.S. because it can either serve to provoke retaliation or will miss out on future threats.  Such a situation proves particularly difficult to deal with for government officials concerned about the potential political situation surrounding the Temple Mount.  The author ends with a chapter about \\"Avoiding the Cain Option\\" in which he notes the particular dangers posed by millenial beliefs (which are really heresies within the various religions) and hopes for the future that Cain can avoid killing his brother Abel, though presented with that opportunity everyday.	2004-08-25

Started by Inigo (Saint Ignatius) of Loyola and once suppressed before in its history, the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) long represented a unique force within the Roman Catholic Church maintaining a code of strict obedience to the Roman Pontiff.  This book begins by showing how the original intent of Ignatian Jesuitism has been subverted, wherein spiritual aspirations are replaced by modern materialist needs.  Thus, many in the Society of Jesus have embraced modernism, particularly in the form of Liberation Theology, and come to fight on the side of Marxism against alleged capitalist oppression (particularly in Latin America where a \\"preferential option for the poor\\" is used to justify Marxist revolution).  Father Malachi Martin traces the history of Jesuitism from Saint Ignatius and then shows how in the modern era, an era characterized by unbelief and materialism, the philosophy of modernism came to dominate within certain circles of the Roman Catholic Church.  Although suppressed by Roman popes, modernism continued to live an underground existence until its eventual rupture during the Second Vatican Council.  Certain documents presented at this council have proven highly ambiguous providing the necessary edge needed by modernists to achieve prominence within the Catholic church and particularly within the Society of Jesus.  Father Malachi Martin shows how three different individuals shaped the Jesuit experience and transformed traditional Jesuitism into its modernist version.  These individuals are George Tyrrell (who denied many of the central tenets of the Catholic faith), Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (who came to believe in a new \\"evolutionary\\" faith), and the individuals behind Liberation Theology (an attempt to smuggle Marxist class struggle into the Christian religion).  The book next traces out the development of these ideas through various General Councils of the Jesuit Order, particularly those headed by Father General Pedro Arrupe.  Father Martin alleges a growing conflict between the Jesuit Order and the Roman papacy, beginning with Pope Paul VI and culminating in the current papacy of John Paul II.  However, despite this conflict, and despite obvious defiance by various individuals within the Jesuit Order, the order has not been suppressed by the popes.  Traditionalists such as the author (now deceased) and others have been forced to abandon the Jesuit Order (making use of the escape clause upon taking the oath to belong to the Jesuits) and have been fervent opponents of the new direction taken by the Jesuits.  This book offers a disturbing account of the church in decline, while modernists within the Jesuit Order attempt to subvert the teachings of the Roman Pontiffs.  Traditionally Jesuits have made great contributions, particularly in the sciences but also in worldly affairs, however as this book shows the original Ignatian spiritual intent of the order has been abandoned since the Second Vatican Council	2004-08-19
US	50058656	R3KDJ0PPH6L3GX	0745308198	514595316	Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies)	Books	5	41	52	N	Y	A Revisionist Interpretation of Classical Judaism.	_Jewish History, Jewish Religion:  The Weight of Three Thousand Years_ by Israel Shahak is one of the more radical and controversial books to have gained some level of respectability dealing with the age old \\"Jewish question\\".  Among other things, the author tries to understand, by tracing the history of classical Judaism and appealing to arguments found in the Talmud and regularly used by rabbis, certain highly anti-social and discriminatory adaptations of the Jews (particularly the extreme orthodox).  The author makes the contention that because he is treating Judaism as a religion and not as the Jewish race that his book is not anti-semitic.  While this may be true, I doubt whether the distinction is a meaningful one at all, considering that the Jewish religion is enforced in such a manner so as to virtually guarrantee racial integrity, one is defined to be a Jew if one had a Jewish mother, i.e. making the Jews a constituted race.  The charge of anti-semitism while appropriate seems really unimportant here because the book does bring up some interesting and important points which are indeed true, though perhaps provocative.  Some of the more notorious claims in this book such as that the Jews offer special prayers to both G-d and Satan, the descriptions of Jesus and Christians found within the Talmud (conveniently excised in more updated post-Enlightenment politically correct versions, though retained through oral tradition), the exclusivity and double standards of Jews in dealing with Gentiles as recommended by the Talmud particularly with regard to usury and the saving of a Gentile life, the insanity of various regulations which Jews are obliged to follow (particularly concerning work on the Sabbath), and the power attained by Jews in medieval Europe frequently provoking peasant uprisings (by oppressed European serfs) against them.  The author makes several other important claims, noting how the Jewish rabbis corrupted the religion through the Talmud, making use of dispensations (in an attempt to deceive their G-d) which were frequently driven entirely by the profit motive, the promotion of Jewish interests first, and the oppression of heretical Jews and the Jewish poor at the expense of the wealthy Jew.  In addition, the author notes how Judaism became increasingly intolerant and closed in, especially bigotted against Christians (frequently Jews would ritually curse Christians, Christ, or engage in such provocative acts as spitting on Crucifixes or burning copies of the New Testament), but also against Arabs and Muslims, and even blacks (in fact Shahak claims that the great Jewish scholar Maimonides was an anti-black racist based on his comments about blacks, comparing them to \\"mute animals\\").  For example, the comments about Jesus, as charlatan and son of a prostitute, in the _Toledot Yeshu_ are notoriously known.  Shahak makes an interesting distinction between peasant uprisings in Europe (which frequently persecuted the Jews, but which were often provoked as a consequence of severe oppression) and the Nazi persecution of Jews which came from above (rather than below) in the form of an oppressive totalitarian technicized state.  While Shahak makes some interesting points, and his book is a needed corrective (particularly in a political environment where books with titles such as _Hitler's Pope_ and _Hitler's Willing Executioners_, blaming all Germans for the Nazi catastrophe have been made widely available), I believe it is both somewhat unfair and highly motivated by a political agenda.  Of course, the antagonism between Jew and Gentile is ages old, and unlikely to ever be resolved, but in addition Shahak's agenda seems to revolve around both support for the state of Israel and the denial of rights to self determination to the Palestinians.  (Shahak of course writes in the tradition of Enlightenment humanism, and is influenced by French Revolutionary ideas of universal human rights, something that I find personally problematic.)  This is a more complicated issue, particularly for Americans to deal with.  Also, many of Shahak's examples are taken from the extreme right among orthodox Jewish rabbis in Israel.  Certainly, similar type statements could be found in reverse against the Jews and non-Muslims if they had been taken from the extreme right of militant Islam.  Nevertheless, the book is courageous in that it does attempt to provide a historical position which could otherwise never see the light of day in the modern politically correct (sanitized) culture, were it not embraced by a significant segment of the left itself.  Those who sneer at this and cry out \\"anti-semitism\\" need only be reminded that books with titles _Why I Am Not a Christian_ and _Why I Am Not a Muslim_ similarly exist.oblematic.)

US	50058656	R3IN6DOZM65PX7	0691089825	115625930	After Liberalism: Mass Democracy in the Managerial State.	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	The Rise of the Managerial State.	_After Liberalism:  Mass Democracy in the Managerial State_ by Paul Gottfried is a very powerful and important book which shows specifically how a discontinuity existing between nineteenth century liberalism and its twentieth century version has made possible the rise of a \\"managerial state\\".  Such a state has made self determination an impossibility, given the rise of a managerial elite to safeguard the public from its own \\"authoritarian\\" tendencies.  Gottfried traces the corruption and discontinuity in liberalism to such figures as Jean Jacques Rousseau (who felt that man must be \\"forced to be free\\"), John Stuart Mill (who ended up advocating socialist policies), and especially John Dewey - all of whom abandoned the free market principles of original liberals.  The influence of Dewey among the educational establishment cannot be underestimated.  In the twentieth century the two world wars brought out a conflict between three separate types of state:  the fascist state of Mussolini (which had \\"gone beserk\\" allying itself with Adolf Hitler), the communist state of Josef Stalin, and the modern managerial/welfare state brought about through New Deal legislation by FDR.  During the war, the communists joined the side of the Allies and destroyed fascism, only later to die a death of their own subsequently that century.  This leaves us today with the managerial state, which seeks to spread a \\"global democratic faith\\" throughout the world, while negating and containing the influences of traditional sources of community, particularly religion.  The new state is pluralistic and multiculturalist (meaning that any friction that arises between different races and ethnic groups must be curtailed in alignment with the \\"moralistic\\" teachings of the managerial elite).  Also, the elite seek to redistribute income by means of democracy and stoking the flames of class warfare and envy.  In the United States in particular, but even more so in the European nations, the nation has beencoopted by elites as a global location for massive immigration from the third world (justified by appealing to the rhetoric of \\"human rights\\", invented by the New Class precisely for this purpose).  Any attempt at dissent from the dominating paradigm is shouted down as \\"insensitivity\\" or worse as outright \\"fascism\\" - a term which is consistently abused and used to stigmatize all those who adhere to traditional notions of self government.  According to Gottfried, both socialist Left and neoconservative \\"Right\\" adhere strongly to these principles regarding them as near articles of faith because they allow the two dominant parties of the elite to maintain their power.  Gottfried also points to a Jewish-Puritanical influence which has sought to contain dissent, particularly through moralism (which amounts to preaching an anti-racist, sensitivity-based social gospel), and shows how all beliefs contrary to this value system are deemed to be a product of \\"mental illness\\", thereby giving a therapeutic role to the elite.  Such a case is particularly emblematic of Adorno's post-World War II studies in the \\"authoritarian personality\\".  With the rise of political correctness in the university system, coupled with a racist national policy of affirmative action, which can be arbitrarily extended, education has been subverted and all means of dissent have been stifled.  Amazingly however, the populace does not support generally the goals of the elite, which has led many who are particularly disturbed by New Class social engineering to appeal to direct democracy.  Gottfried also shows how populist resistance to the managerial state has built up and found expression in movements both in the United States and Europe.  For example, Gottfried cites former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who appealed to the tradition of an isolationist, nationalist \\"Old Right\\" as well as traditional Catholicism, and the National Front of Le Pen in France which sought to deal effectively with the immigration problem for France.  Also, Gottfried notes that \\"postmodernist rightists\\" such as Alain de Benoist in France successful criticize the current state, despite disgusting attempts by postmodernist leftists such as Jacques Derrida to entirely censor them.  Indeed, Gottfried provides several examples of precisely how \\"anti-hate legislation\\" is used as a weapon of tyranny by the elite managerial class to maintain their power.  Unfortunately, while populist resistance does exist, it has also been severely marginalized.  Gottfried seems unable to fully predict the future of the managerial state, though he obviously supports populist resistance and secessionary movements.  One issue that remains important though I believe is not fully dealt with by Gottfried is how to rectify calls for a completely free market with cultural conservativism and restoration of tradition.  Afterall, a completely free market would presumably have no restrictions on such things as drugs, abortions, pornography, or prostitution, things which would have to be prevented by appeals to traditional morality and religion.  Also, it is difficult to see how such a thing could avoid falling into outright barbarism.  In sum, however, while the future for democratic liberalism and self-determination looks bleak, given the rise of an elite class who intend to enforce their values on all citizens, populist resistance is possible, and is perhaps the only way towards counter-revolution.	2004-08-14

Antifederalists opposed the Constitution on different grounds, including especially the need for a Bill of Rights ammendment.  Antifederalists also came to emphasize the rights of states and localism within government, opposing the strong centralizing tendencies within the Constitution and which existed after the Constitution was ratified.  Individuals such as Jefferson and Madison came to embrace certain aspects of the Antifederalist tradition in their opposition to the centralizing tendencies of Hamilton, who proposed to create among other things a centralized banking system.  Many of the original Antifederalists feared the influence of a large centralized government, maintaining that such a thing could lead to the promotion of an aristocracy who would operate against the interests of the common people.  The tradition of Antifederalism continues to play an important part in constitutional debate today.  Many have looked towards this tradition as a means for protecting the rights of states as well as Second Ammendment rights to private gun ownership from the influence of the federal government.	2004-08-07

The central idea behind holism is to perceive the world in terms of \\"whole\\" in accordance with the tenet that \\"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\\" in opposition to the mechanistic science - rationalism, materialism, positivism, Darwinism, and capitalism - that had grown out of the French revolution.  German holism bears especially the influences of Kant and Romanticism (as well as Schopenhauer, Schelling, Hegel, and Haeckel and Bergson) and may be described as mystical, metaphysical, influenced by \\"irrationalism\\" and \\"life philosophy\\".  In particular, the writings of Goethe are frequently found opposed to the mechanistic/deterministic views of Newton.  In biology, Darwinism and the \\"man as machine\\" motif are considered anathema and instead a more unified view of man in terms of his spiritual essence is sought for.  In terms of politics, German holism bore the brunt of the period of crisis culminating in the First World War, thus becoming anti-democratic (even aristocratic), conservative, or reactionary.  Also, many of the German holistic scientists were influenced by Richard Wagner or Chamberlain, especially with regard to anti-Semitism.  This book begins with Max Weber's famous speech against mysticism in science and takes a look at several chief figures who may be described as holistic scientists (including Jakob von Uexkull - behavioral biologist, Constantin von Monakow - clinical neurologist, Max Wertheimer - Gestalt psychologist, and Kurt Goldstein - holistic neuropsychiatrist) as well as the difficult subject of the influence of holism on the Nazis (eugenics, euthanasia movements, etc.).  Jakob von Uexkull was an important aristocratic biologist who under the influence of Kantian subjectivism proposed a \\"soap bubble\\" theory of the scientist as observer, which he called the Umwelt theory (a term which was later deployed by ecologists to describe the ecological surroundings of an animal).  Uexkull was a friend of both Hans Driesch, an important voice for \\"vitalism\\" within biology, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.  In Uexkull's view both Darwin and Haeckel were mistaken, and he sought to bring out the contrast between the Darwinian viewpoint and his holistic viewpoint in what may be termed \\"the gorilla-machine\\".  In his play \\"God or Gorilla\\", Uexkull writes, \\"It is . . . for the individual person not a matter of indifference whether the world is ruled by a moral or an amoral principle.  Eventually there comes a day, even for the most confirmed atheist, when he must address himself to [the problem of] the Rule of the Universe.  If - instead of a Spirit who, standing over the people, produced him and his companions, and at the same time speaks his conscience to him - if he should then find nothing but a lifeless machine that mocks all his heart's yearnings, then this machine will begin to take on a satanic life.  A horrible grotesque face grins at him.  This is what [William Jennings] Bryan has identified as the Gorilla.  Omnipotence has fallen into the hands of an ape-like monster.\\"  And, later Uexkull was to write to his friend Chamberlain, \\"With the destruction of Christianity and its God, the human being stops being human and becomes something worse than a beast; he becomes a machine, the most pitiless being of all\\" revealing his opposition to mechanism and Darwinism.  Later Uexkull was to write a reactionary and anti-democratic work entitled _Biology of the State_ which argued for a race-based and medieval view of the state which influenced some National Socialists.  A second important holistic scientist is that of Constantin von Monakow, who was influenced by his early Russian orthodox upbringing as well as belief in a household demon called theDomowoi.  Monakow worked in Switzerland as a clinical neurologist on the brain injured and his views came to increasingly resemble those of a fellow Swiss, the psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung.  Monakow proposed a theory of the \\"horme\\" much like the \\"entelechy\\" of Hans Driesch as his guiding principle.  He argued that the mind must undergo a breakdown (\\"diaschisis\\").  Other influences on Monakow included Sigmund Freud (whose view of human nature he sought to overcome in his search for God) and the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson.  A third series of holistic scientists are those who created the theory of the Gestalt (particularly within psychology).  Although individuals such as Chamberlain would use this term to refer to the unity of the German Volk, Gestalt psychology came to be dominated by a Jewish influence.  The basic principle involved was that \\"the whole exceeds the sum of its parts\\", and individuals involved in the creation of this viewpoint include the philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels, the psychologist Max Wertheimer who later was forced to flee Germany along with many other Jewish radicals when the Nazis came to power, and the German psychologist and student of Wertheimer, Wolfgang Koehler.  Wertheimer came to embrace a leftist political vision championing democracy and freedom, but also arguing against relativistic concepts of \\"truth\\" and \\"number\\" which he believed to be at root in Nazism.  A fourth holistic scientist is that of the Jewish psychiatrist Kurt Goldstein.  Goldstein argued against what he believed was the \\"therapeutic nihilism\\" of his time in his work with brain injured soldiers.  He was influenced by such thinkers as Ernst Cassirer, Goethe, phenomenology (Husserl), and existentialism (Merleau-Ponty, Tillich).  The book ends with a discussion of Nazi holism in medicine and euthanasia as well as the subsequent role of holism in the philosophy of the German Green party.  I believe the other reviewers have been profoundly unfair to this particular point of view, holism.  Indeed, Gestalt psychology played a large role in interaction with Albert Einstein.  Also, in one interpretation the Nazi bureaucracy may be perceived as a continuation of the mechanistic thinking which began in the French Revolution and not as an overflowing of holistic (mystical?) ideas within science.	2004-07-30

For this [the Cross] it was whereon the Saviour of the World, bursting the bonds of death, did vanquish that cunning serpent, the Devil, and by His sufferings earned for His servants so great fortitude as that they were ready in gladness of spirit to endure the most arduous hardships of every sort, even, if need were, to the shedding of their blood and the most cruel lopping off of all their limbs.  ? Chapter 1. <br /> <br />_Tortures and Torments of the Christian Martyrs_ was written by Roman Catholic priest Reverend Antonio Gallonio in 1591 and dedicated to Pope Clement VIII.  The book relies heavily on previous martyrologies as well as histories of the church and the lives of the saints.  The purpose of the book is to show the believing Christian soul the glory won for him by the steadfast belief of his predecessors in faith, who stood firm against the tortures and torments of their captors, enduring till the end and never breaking with the faith, winning for themselves the crown of martyrdom.  The book includes gory details of the various implements of torture ? from the Cross itself to the rack, the wheel, the wooden horse, etc. ? used by the Roman heathen or the Jews against the early Christian believers.  In addition, various woodcuts are provided detailing with exactitude the bloody nature of these torturing implements.  Much is recounted from the lives of the saints and martyrs who were offered up to God as sacrifice, remaining steadfast in their faith.  Many blessed Christian virgins were defiled by the heathen?s armies, and many Christian soldiers were put to the test.  The cruelty of the Roman emperors to the early Christians is thoroughly seen throughout.  The book also details other manners of torture including torment by scourging and fire, as well as being fed to the wild animals (the notorious lions and wild beasts to which the early Christians were made to suffer).  The book includes details of the martyrs being sent into exile or made to work under harsh conditions in the mines, blasphemed against, or made to blaspheme their God by means of idolatry to the Roman emperor.  In addition, the author also notes how Catholics in his own day were made to suffer under the Anglican schism, providing details from the lives of martyrs in England referencing the works of Sanders (_Origins and Progress of the Anglican Schism_).  For the Christian believer, this book provides countless images of cruelty inflicted upon Christian souls suffering in countless lands before tyrannical governments.  The author prays, ?Here on earth, most gracious Lord God!  let the torments of the body be multiplied an hundredfold, that there in paradise gladness and peace may be increased.  Oh!  breasts burning with the flame of love divine, oh!  hearts kindled with the ardour of the Holy Spirit!?  The book includes an introduction by the translator A. R. Allinson.  In addition, this Feral House edition is supplied with an appendix detailing the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ written by noted medical specialists.  This appendix/essay was used by Mel Gibson in his making of the recent film, _The Passion of Christ_.   <br />	2004-07-23
US	50058656	R1DZXUZNPWI5HE	0895550156	61773656	Catholic Prophecy: The Coming Chastisement	Books	5	50	53	N	N	The Coming Great Chastisement!	_Catholic Prophecy:  The Coming Chastisement_ by Yves Dupont consists of a series of prophecies from various Roman Catholic saints, thinkers, and popes from throughout the centuries regarding the state of the world and the church.  These prophecies emphasize among other things a falling away from the faith, various natural disasters, the rise of a great monarch, the restoration of the Roman emperor, the rise of a great pope, a coming chastisement (possibly involving a comet passing by the earth), and various political events including predictions of both world wars (and a possible Third World War).  The first section of this book deals entirely with excerpts from the writings of different Roman Catholic saints, seers, prophets, and popes which reveal these events coming to pass.  The author then comments on each of these writings, providing interesting interpretations (involving for example the spread of communism, the Russian empire, the rise of Mohammedism, the return of the Jews to Israel, and various political events and wars including the Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the First and Second World War, and even modern day conflicts such as the Vietnam War).  The next section of this book details the passage of a comet, which will come as a form of chastisement and involve many natural disasters upon the earth.  The third section of this book deals with the \\"End of the World\\".  It is written that \\"no one knows of the day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only\\" (Matthew 24.36); however, we are told that certain signs must occur before the end is to come.  The author shows how some of these signs such as the preaching of the Gospel to all nations of the earth and the subsequent falling away from the faith may already be upon us; however, he interprets this in terms of two separate stages within the Latter-Days period.  In addition, this means that the reign of Antichrist must come soon.  The fourth section of thisbook deals with the prophecies of the Roman Catholic seer Michel de Nostradamus.  Nostradamus has been much maligned due to his association with various cranks and sensationalist individuals.  However, the author shows that many of his prophecies hold much interest for the Roman Catholic believer.  The author distinguishes between public revelation (such as that revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures) and private revelation (which is not necessarily an article of faith) such as that revealed by the saints and prophets.  Particularly of interest are the apparitions of the Virgin Mary, particularly at Fatima, where various secrets were revealed about the state of the church as well as Russian communism.  An especially important prophetess is that of the Augustinian nun Anne Catherine Emmerich, whose visions have provided much of interest for the Roman Catholic believer.  The final section of this book concludes with a discussion of the current crisis within the church as revealed by the saints and prophets.  Various events which occurred at the Second Vatican Council have lead to a falling away from the faith by the priests, a turn towards immorality, and a degradation of the mass through various reforms (including a loss of the original Latin as preserved in the Tridentine mass).  In addition, Rome itself may be under a most diabolical spell, given the refusal or inability of the post-conciliar popes to rectify this situation.  The author remains uncertain regarding these matters.  This book provides a good introduction to Roman Catholic prophecy, the various saints, seers, prophets, and popes which have made declarations regarding worldly affairs and the state of the church throughout the ages.	2004-07-13
US	50058656	R2QQ0TRFIB66FD	0900588241	908325351	The Crisis of the Modern World (Rene Guenon Works)	Books	5	19	22	N	Y	Rene Guenon and the Crisis of the Modern World.	In perhaps his most important work, _The Crisis of the Modern World_, traditionalist thinker Rene Guenon outlines his philosophy and shows how the traditional outlook is opposed by modern developments.  Guenon begins by noting that the modern world has brought about a crisis, conceived by many in terms of apocalypse and the \\"end times\\" (the coming dark age of the Kali Yuga in terms of Hindu cyclical cosmology), which can only be resolved by a return of the West to the traditional outlook.  Taking off from what he had written earlier in a book entitled _East and West_, Guenon notes that the worldviews of West and East are profoundly different from each other, the East maintaining its traditions, while the West creeps towards degeneracy in the form of modernism and materialism.  Much of this book is spent contrasting East and West, attempting to demonstrate exactly where the West has gone astray (both in its attempts to colonize the East and in its rampant materialism and modernism).  In the East, three great traditions remain corresponding to the Near, Middle, and Far East respectively.  These are the traditions of Islam, the traditions of India (especially Hinduism), and the traditions of the Chinese civilization.  Guenon believes that only one possible source for traditional renewal remains in the West, and that is the Catholic (meaning \\"universal\\") Church, which he opposes to Protestant Christianity or modern day \\"rationalism\\", for example.  Tranditionalism places an emphasis on both \\"primordialism\\" and universality, in line with its Vedantist roots.  Guenon also notes several contrasting distinctions between the traditional viewpoint and that of the modern day (the Western materialist/\\"rationalist\\" outlook).  Part of this involves the contrast between sacred and profane science.  Modernists emphasize profane science, attempting to desacralize nature, and place their priority in both pragmatism and the material world.  Such a view has come even to relegate metaphysical notions of truth to the realm of the purely pragmatic and utilitarian.  Guenon also notes how the modern day world is dominated by a mass democratic levelling brought about by what he terms \\"individualism\\".  It is this form of \\"individualism\\" which has led to materialism and an emphasis on pure pragmatics (quantity as opposed to quality), although he contrasts this to the more genuine view of the traditional man which remains opposed to the encroaching influences of force, through the state for example.  Guenon sees much to criticize in the democratic development of the West, seeing in democracy a form of mass levelling.  Opposing these developments within the modern world, Guenon calls for a new intellectual elite, who will serve to revive tradition where it is to be found.  This revival also centers around the schism between East and West.  In this sense, those among the \\"intellectual elite\\" must either opt to integrate the traditions of the East (which remain viable) into the West or attempt to restore genuine Western tradition (such as that which exists in a form of decline within the Catholic Church).  Guenon remains a champion of the East and notes the Western bias and attempt to dominate the traditional East, citing several sources of this problematic, where he means by the West the modern materialist-driven West and not the traditional West.  This book serves as an important introduction to the thinking of Rene Guenon, who is the father of the traditionalist school which also includes Ananda Coomaraswamy, Frithjof Schuon, Julius Evola, and Mircea Eliade, among others.  It serves to highlight many of the contrasts which exist between the modern world (undergoing crisis) and the traditional outlook.  Guenon notes that while there is a tendency for those among the traditional camp to despair, given the bleak outlook presented by the modern world (which may be destroyed in catastrophe given its false foundations), that this tendency should be overcome, particularly by those among his chosen elite.  Guenon quotes several important passages from the Gospel accounts to illustrate his point.  Truly the modern world represents the traditional Kali Yuga of the Hindu cycle, a dark age of rampant materialism, and a decline from the once golden age of spiritual tradition.	2004-07-11

In the book _Eugenics and Other Evils_, Roman Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton takes on the eugenists and their immoral and unethical program for human breeding.  At the time, eugenists (among both the Social Darwinist \\"Right\\" and the Socialist Left) proposed various methods for interfering with human breeding to promote a social agenda and impact the human population.  One form of eugenics, referred to as \\"positive eugenics\\", sought to increase the birthrate of the \\"fit\\" (mainly the upper, educated classes) through incentive programs.  Another form of eugenics, referred to as \\"negative eugenics\\", sought to decrease the birthrate of the \\"unfit\\" (mainly the lower classes, the \\"mentally feeble\\", and chronically ill populations) through birth control (or even more diabolical means, later on, such as abortion or euthanasia).  Chesterton takes on both forms of eugenics as well as the \\"birth controllers\\", both of whom planned on limiting the rights of those deemed \\"mentally feeble\\" to procreate, and shows through a series of paradoxes exactly how immoral, unethical, and downright mean their program is.  Chesterton's condemnations of this program are consistent with his Roman Catholic beliefs and the condemnation of both eugenics and birth control by subsequent popes.  It is for this reason that many involved in the birth control movement came to label Chesterton as a \\"deeply reactionary man\\" who stood in the way of progress.  In his book _The Servile State_, Chesterton's friend and fellow writer Hilaire Belloc notes how society is progressing in a direction towards servility, in which more and more will work for less and less, collectively losing their liberties.  Belloc contrasted this state of affairs to the current capitalist state (run according to the principles of competition and greed, amounting to plutocracy) and that state dreamed up by socialist reformers (calling for the elimination of property rights, and thus a complete suppression of liberty), both of whichBelloc regarded as immoral and un-Christian.  As an alternative, Belloc proposed a \\"distributivist state\\" which would allow for mass ownership of private property and the means of production, while curtailing the evils of monopoly capitalism run amok.  Like Belloc, Chesterton too advocates a distributivist state, championing property while at the same time pointing to the excesses of monopoly capitalism and plutocracy-oligarchy.  In addition, Chesterton notes that while the &quot;servile state\\" is upon us, so is the \\"eugenic state\\" in which the right to marriage and procreation will be limited by the elite controllers within the state.  Chesterton points out how diabolical and grossly unfair this situation is, with plenty of recourse to his usual writing style and witticism.  As Chesterton notes, within the current state of affairs, those among the lower classes and the poor do not stand a chance, their rights to property being denied them (contrary to the situation that existed within the Middle Ages, where a serf could at least maintain a right to property), and are often imprisoned unfairly or abused by the system.  Chesterton sees within the eugenics movement another form of abuse (particularly of the poor and those deemed \\"feeble minded\\").  Indeed, much of this book is spent critiquing various legislative actions taken against the so called \\"feeble minded\\", which Chesterton shows to be a term without meaning, being used merely as a slur against certain unpopular and not well liked individuals among the lower classes.  To explain the rise of eugenics Chesterton examines the social Darwinist views of the capitalist class.  As Chesterton notes, many of those in the highest class have swung full spectrum from the Socialist Left to the extreme \\"Right\\" as they accumulate wealth and advance plutocracy.  In America, robber barons such as Rockefeller notoriously funded the eugenics movement, in an attempt to further his power and as Chesterton cynically notes to provideworkers for his business.  Indeed, the documented evidence against Rockefeller's involvement in such immoralities is enormous and certainly merits additional study.  While many of those who supported eugenics (and especially birth control) consisted of those among the Socialist Left, Chesterton notes that these individuals remain largely dupes to their elite controllers, as well as radical feminists who fail to understand the true virtues of womanhood.  Certainly these radical feminists (almost entirely composed of women from the upper classes, coincidentally) do not represent the vast majority of the female race, who are certainly not opposed to motherhood, whether or not they personally desire to become mothers themselves.  These sorts of observations of Chesterton would prove especially prescient, especially in light of the events that were to come during the Second World War (as well as the evils of the Soviet state bureaucracy) and the modern day legalization of abortion and proliferation of birth control methods.  While eugenists maintain that they are champions of the poor or of the unborn child, as Chesterton shows they are merely evil individuals among the elite classes whose sole interest is limiting the growth of \\"undesirable\\" elements within society, or alarmist Malthusians.  This essay of Chesterton reveals him as a champion of liberty and individualism against the encroaching influence of a maleficent state, under the control of elite plutocrats, as well as a compassionate individual who truly cares for the human person.  The book ends with a series of compiled pieces from various eugenics journals and birth control writers, noting their diabolical features as well as their arrogant criticism of Chesterton and Belloc.	2004-07-09
US	50058656	RPQWR285TZRXZ	0900588063	710434514	Lucifer's Lodge: Satanic Ritual Abuse in the Catholic Church	Books	5	104	118	N	Y	Satanic Ritual Abuse and the Roman Catholic Church.	_Lucifer's Lodge_ by William H. Kennedy is a highly disturbing book detailing various accounts of pedophilia and other forms of sexual abuse as well as Satanic ritual among Roman Catholic priests, as well as speculation concerning various Satanic secret societies and sex magic cults which have infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church.  The author, a friend of Father Malachi Martin (who wrote a fictional account detailing Satanism within the Vatican, _Windswept House_), has unearthed many very bizarre and twisted details of the sexual activities of predator priests.  However, unlike certain other books which have been made available detailing the sex scandals (particularly within the Boston Archdiocese under Cardinal Bernard Law), this book attempts to show that Satanic abuse may be involved.  As noted in the introduction, by Tracy R. Twyman, throughout the Old Testament the ancient Hebrews encountered various depraved sex cults (which included bestiality, homosexuality, and pedophilia) which were repeatedly condemned by that ancient people and their God, Yahweh, as Satanic in nature.  Satan, or Lucifer, is regarded by Christians to be a fallen angel, cast out of heaven for pride before God, and according to Christian doctrine has been trying to destroy Christ and His Church since its inception.  Indeed, to instate the reign of Antichrist upon the Earth, Satanists seek a worldwide institution to serve as a vehicle for their diabolical plot.  No institution could be more fit for that role than the Roman Catholic Church and its venerable hierarchy.  The author distinguishes between modern day Satanists (of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, for example) who are mere hedonists and self worshippers, and the more diabolical kind (unrecognized by modern day Satanists) who may engage in human sacrifice and sexual depravity.  The first chapter of this book concerns the original \\"Satanic Panic\\" of the 1980s, a modern day witch craze, which brought many innocently accused into the spotlight.  However, as the author notes, this original Satanic scare may have merely covered up the more diabolical kind, which currently may exist within the Roman Catholic Church.  The author next considers some severely sick and disturbed individuals among the Roman Catholic priesthood.  Many of these are sexual predators, although not all pedophiles (and quite a few are blasphemers as well).  Perhaps one of the sickest individuals considered is that of \\"Father\\" Paul R. Shanley, a \\"priest\\" in the Boston Archdiocese, who engaged in pedophiliac and homosexual acts with countless victims (especially among disaffected and troubled youth), was an active member of the Gay Liberation movement, and whose perverted speech on \\"man-boy love\\" served as inspiration for the founding of the ultra-sick NAMBLA organization.  This part of the story is particularly difficult to take, and the reader may feel him or herself having to retch several times over as he completes this most vile chapter in the history of pedophiliac priests.  The odd thing about these priests is that nothing was done to defrock them and remove them from interacting with the youth by the Catholic hierarchy.  In fact, many of them were given protection or variously re-assigned.  The author also examines the secret psychiatric hospitals where many of these so called \\"priests\\" are sent to be \\"cured\\" of their diabolical disease.  The author also shows how certain other priests within the Church, particularly those of a traditionalist bent, have been prevented from stopping the perverse actions and goings-on.  Indeed, one Father Alfred Kunz, a friend of both Fathers Malachi Martin and the Dominican Charles Fiore, was found murdered, in ritualistic fashion (his throat was cut, having revealed the secrets of the brethren and a mutilated calf was found nearby), for having promised to reveal details of the pedophiliac priesthood.  Much of this book is spent detailing various aspects of the secret societies involved inSatanic ritual and \\"sex magic\\".  The author refers to these as \\"the underground sewer\\", referencing Saint Thomas Aquinas and his remarks on prostitution.  According to certain heretical movements (and according to the popular book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_), Christ may have been married as well as promiscuous and have spawned a bloodline.  This is certainly the most diabolical of all heresies, attempting to mar the innocence of Christ.  Indeed, even the Mormons have been known to believe such things, and supposedly a geneological chart detailing the supposed \\"bloodline\\" of Christ through the French and Merovingian kings can be found at their temple in Salt Lake City.  The author argues that this cult has infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church as well, perhaps as far up as the Vatican, and refers to it (as did Malachi Martin) as \\"Lucifer's Lodge\\".  Certainly this is a most disturbing revelation.  The question remains as to what Catholics can do to reclaim their Church from the treacheries of Satan.  Given the sorry state of the American Church it remains a difficult question to answer.  The Catholic hierarchy, overtaken by liberalism and the so called \\"Spirit of Vatican II\\", continue to enact diabolic \\"reforms\\" within the Church and protect pedophiles and homosexuals.  Indeed, many of the homosexual priests are blackmailed by the pedophiles into protecting their cult.  Satan's serpents continue to move against Christ and His Church as well as climb the rungs of the hierarchical ladder making their way up to the Pope himself.  Perhaps this is an indication that we are living near a time of great turmoil, as revealed in prophecy.	2004-07-01

Carto of the Liberty Lobby which expounds the populist political philosophy for the American nation by offering small profiles of some of the greatest historical populist figures.  Many politicians of today claim the populist label; however, as this volume shows few among the Establishment's figures fully understand this political philosophy.  Populism is opposed to both monopoly capitalism, high finance, the Federal Reserve banking system, as well as communism and socialism.  Populism also argues for an America First, nationalist and non-interventionist, foreign policy of armed neutrality, as opposed to the internationalist policies of both so called \\"right\\" and left wing elites.  Populism also suggests a scientific tariff system, opposing free trade, to reduce unfair competition from foreign industry, as well as restrictions on immigration from the Third World.  Populism also sees the importance of Western civilization (despite its apparent decline into decadence and immorality) against encroaching alien influences and the ever broadening New World Order program of the elite.  Against such mattoid criminals as Karl Marx, John D. Rockefeller, and agents for global Zionism, populism maintains the interest of the common American working man and the agrarian farmer.  This volume features profiles of various figures transcending both political parties (Republican and Democrat) who have at times espoused elements of the populist philosophy.  These include President and agrarian democrat Thomas Jefferson, populist President Andrew Jackson and opponent to the federal bank, inventor Thomas Edison, Senator Robert LaFollette, Senator Thomas Watson, press lord William Randolph Hearst, American industrialist Henry Ford, California progressive Hiram Johnson, \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" William Murray, newspaper publisher Robert R. McCormick, columnist and wit H. L. Mencken, Senator Burton K. Wheeler, poet Ezra Pound, Representative Hamilton Fish, Senator George W. Malone, Roman Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin, Senator Huey Long, populist intellectual Lawrence Dennis, Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, and Mayor Frank Rizzo.  Many of these populists remained resolute in their opposition to American involvement in the First and Second World Wars as well as to unfair income taxation which is used as a weapon by the ultra-rich against the middle class.  This book contains many insights into the nature of American politics, where our wealth and resources are continually plundered by robber barons to be pawned off to the Third World through war and \\"relief efforts\\".  Today, the political Establishment acts in complete opposition to the populist philosophy attempting to censor it where it is found.

Upon reading this book, several things become immediately clear to the reader - Chomsky is a socialist with sympathy for the Soviet Union and Chomsky unequivocally supports the United Nations.  As an ideologue of the \\"New Left\\", Chomsky allows himself to indulge in abstruse argumentation and moral equivalences attempting to equate the United States with the Soviet Union, the terrorist PLO with Israel.  Chomsky is morally opposed to all war, the spread of communism does not particularly bother him, despite his occassional barb at \\"Stalinism\\" (seemingly provoked more out of jealousy than any genuine repulsion towards it).  In the past, Chomsky has made several outlandish statements, including announcing his support for the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia (a black mark that has proven particularly difficult for his \\"New Left\\" followers to eradicate).  As a supporter of the United Nations, Chomsky hopes for a day when the United States will completely abandon its national sovereignity to the collective wills of Third World dictators and communist nations.  Chomsky believes that Zionism is a continuation of \\"colonialism\\" (something that has become very trendy to decry, among the \\"New Left\\" \\"intellectual\\" elite) and therefore unequivocally supports the Palestinian identity.  This is particularly ironic given the fact that Chomsky himself is a Jew with specific links to the Jewish elite within the United States who himself lived for a time in a kibbutz within Israel.  The book itself seems at times more an exercise in intellectual onanism than anything else.  Newspaper clippings are cited out of order, historical events are decontextualized, obscure arguments and apparent moral equivalences are made.  At times Chomsky seems more disturbed by the failure of his own anti-war cronies on the far Left (such as Jane Fonda or Alan Dershowitz) to adopt his particular point of view with regard to the Mideast conflict.  Certainly nothing even approximating a genuine look at the political situation is attempted here.  Since this book was written, the United States remains just as entangled in the Mideast situation as ever.  Certainly such a situation is disturbing for those who recall the warnings of the American Founding Fathers to avoid foreign entanglements.  In the meantime, both Israelis and Palestinians continue to murder each other.  Whether or not someday this situation may heat up so as to start the Third World War remains to be seen.  We can only pray that such a course of events do not come about.ronies on the far Left (such as Jane Fonda or Alan Dershowitz) to adopt his particular point of view with regard to the Mideast conflict.

With the breakdown of the Soviet Union in a post Cold War era and the subsequent liberalization of the Russian economy, a precarious political situation has developed within Russia which may prove ripe for opportunists.  One such opportunist is the ultra-nationalist maverick Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a man known for both his outlandish rhetoric, populist-nationalist outlook, and anti-Semitism.  Zhirinovsky stands as head (vozhd') of the misnamed Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), an ultra-nationalist whose political stance remains a pile of contradictions.  Zhirnovsky who is of Jewish ancestry (on his father's side) spews a virulently nationalist concoction of political ideology and remains staunchly anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish as well as anti-American.  Zhirinovsky has called for the Russian annexation of Finland, the extension of the Russian border to the edge of Germany (meeting with German ultra-rightists) including the annexation of Poland, the annexation of the Kurile Islands from Japan, the return of Alaska to Russia, and in general the restoration of the original Russian borders of 1913.  At the same time, Zhirinovsky has announced Russian solidarity with various Islamic extremists, the Iraq of Saddam Hussein, and the Serbian nationalist Slobodan Milosevich.  Zhirinovsky's politics combine remnants from the conservative elements of the old Soviet bureaucracy as well as the Soviet military, Russian nationalists, European ultra-rightists, and various disaffected individuals within Russian society (including outcastes, the \\"Lumpen\\") who have been marginalized by the coming liberalization of the Russian economy.  Perhaps Zhirinovsky's relationship to these people can be explained by his own position as social outcaste throughout most of his life.  During his youth Zhirinovsky lived in extreme poverty, his mother having to remarry, and upon attending university where he studied Turkish language he was frequently in conflict with the Communist Party, where he was labelled a \\"political activist\\" and \\"psychologically disordered\\".  Oddly, Zhirinovsky has enjoyed some success, including a widespread popularity and populist appeal, gaining leadership of the LDP, as well as coming in third behind Yeltsin and Ryzhnov in the general election.  What is particularly disturbing for Americans is that Zhirinovsky would have access to the nuclear weapons arsenal of the former Soviet Union which he has promised to use.  In addition, Zhirinovsky's relationship to the KGB remains problematic - while some have argued that he was labelled as an enemy by the KGB others believe that in fact he was an agent of this bureaucratic police force.  Zhirinovsky's life has frequently been challenged and certain individuals have called for his assassination.  However, as the authors of this book argue, should Zhirinovsky be assassinated certainly another (perhaps even more extreme than he) would rise to take his place.  In the press, Zhirinovsky has been compared frequently to Hitler and been called a \\"fascist\\" (a term virtually without meaning given its chronic abuse); however, he has successfully sued those who use this epithet to describe him, despite his stated admiration for certain parts of Hitler's regime.  At times Zhirinovsky has resorted to racialist doctrines (popular among the right wing of his own LDP party), including his proclamation that only blonde haired and blue eyed Russians would appear on national television.  Zhirinovsky remains a difficult figure to understand, representing perhaps a red-brown alliance within Russian politics.  However, among the radical right and Russian ultra-nationalists Zhirinovsky's rhetoric remains relatively mild, as compared for example to that of certain individuals within Pamyat (meaning \\"memory\\") or others who call for outright pogroms.  Indeed, most of those on the radical right regard Zhirinovsky as a Zionist agent, especially given his Jewish background which he has frequently tried to cover up.  The authors state that perhaps only the anti-Semitism native to the Russian people will prevent Zhirinovsky from gaining power.  This book provides an interesting review of Zhirinovsky's life and politics although at times it may appear overly alarmist.  <br />For further reading on the Russian radical right:  _The Black Hundreds_ by Walter Laqueur.	2004-06-20

Alexander Hislop is a book which attempts to prove that the worship of the Roman Church is that of ancient Babylon and that paganism was later added into original Christianity by Roman Catholicism.  The book looks at the Roman Catholic calendar, the holidays, the sacaments, priestly orders, the papacy, and all the rest of Catholic tradition and argues that these elements are in fact pagan in source, claiming that the Bible alone is to be the sole source of authority for the practicing Christian (relying of course on private interpretation, problematic in itself).  Of course, original Christianity did not even have the Bible in its canonical form (however, they did have the mass, performed in memory of Christ Jesus); nevertheless, Hislop argues that the Bible is to be the sole source of authority.  Of course, tradition itself allows one to assert the authority of the Holy Bible as Word of God, but Hislop will nonetheless claim that tradition is \\"pagan\\" in origin.  Basically this book is a work of hatred, which relies on the common fallacy that because two religious practices are similar (in outward appearance) they must share the same origin.  In fact, the religious beliefs of the early Aryan European pagans may have been an important foreshadowing of the later Christian religion that overtook them.  The Protestantism advocated by Hislop is bitterly iconoclastic (no doubt smashing artworks, quite literally) and puritanical as well as nationalistic.  For example, Hislop is opposed to such common practices as the celebration of Christmas and the use of colored eggs at Easter.  Such hardheaded know nothingness is certainly responsible for the rise of modern day nihilism and the secular state.  The Roman Church claims apostolic lineage from Christ himself through Saint Peter, the first pope.  Hislop merely takes this great religion, extracts its holy book and proclaims that that book is the religion itself.  Of course, the battle haswaged on since the Reformation, but Hislop represents some of the most extreme forces of opposition to the papacy within Protestantism.	2004-06-04

This rather large book consists of a series of essays detailing the perspective of Intelligent Design Theory from the Christian point of view and a series of contrasting essays from Darwinian orthodoxy opposing this theory.  One unfortunate aspect of this book, which consists otherwise of some rather interesting essays, is that the essays are selected in such a manner so as to make the ID perspective look ridiculous at every point.  Thus, after every issue is dealt with from the perspective of ID two subsequent essays appear which are supposed to refute the ID perspective from the Darwinian.  In practice, this amounts to little more than overkill which makes one wonder, what is the point of having a debate if you are going to stack the cards beforehand.  Also, many of these so- called \\"objective\\" scientists and philosophers seem to be engaging in little more than name calling and credential comparing.  One example of this is the essay of the popularizer Richard Dawkins who appears to be interested very little in the actual content of an essay by Philip Johnson and more interested in the fact that this individual happens to be a lawyer, cashing in on the near universal animosity felt towards lawyers among the populist masses.  This isn't to say that Johnson's essay is particularly good or rings true, but the fact that Dawkins cannot control his juvenile tendencies here is really a good indication of the knee jerk reactionism of the Darwinian Left.  Of course, the issue of Intelligent Design is a complicated one, one that is not fully worked out here.  In addition, the compiler Pennock seems to be under the impression that \\"creationism\\" is strictly a Protestant phenomenon.  This may be the case for \\"liberal Catholicism\\" however many traditionalists within the Catholic church have offered an alternative interpretation of Creation.  In fact, the writings of Jesuit priest and evolutionist Teilhard de Chardin were placed on the Index and can hardly be taken to constituteorthodoxy within the church.  Also the \\"process theologies\\" proposed by certain clergymen within this volume can hardly be taken for Christian orthodoxy either.  The issues involving Darwinism include a conspicuous absence of intermediate evolutionary forms within the fossil record, a problem concerning the probabilities involved (being miniscule, making it difficult to reconcile Darwinism with reality, at least in one interpretation), and other issues dealing with absent data regarding (supposed) speciation.  Intelligent Design Theory differs from classical Creationism in that it is not \\"young Earth\\" and that it does not take the actual Genesis account overliterally, merely arguing for an intelligent designer.  Also, it should be noted that Creationism proper need not be solely Christian; for example, there exist Islamic, Hindu, and Buddhist \\"creationists\\" who challenge the Darwinist hegemony.  Thus, the issues involved are rather complex and really it requires a careful reading to fully understand.  Certainly they cannot be passed over in the manner they are in the nave Darwinism taught for example in public schools.  Even within the scientific community of evolutionary biologists different evolutionary theories exist - contrast the (standard) Darwinist theory of Mayr with the punctuated equilibrium proposal of Gould.  These issues in fact may touch on the very nature of the scientific endeavor, and the contrast that exists between materialism (today called \\"physicalism\\", given the interchangeability of matter-energy) and theistic realism.  This book is decent in that it presents many essays from a wide variety of points of view even though one must sort through the compiler's own bias in his presentation of them.  It is to be recommended to both the scientist and philosopher as well as the theologian and layman.	2004-06-03

Fuller Torrey and examines the issue of the increase in worldwide cases of insanity since the eighteenth century.  The book is at once both a scientific study which attempts to explain certain statistical data from different parts of the world, including Europe, the United States, and Canada, as well as a history of the mental asylum.  Torrey examines in particular the issue of insanity and it's two principal forms - that of schizophrenia and that of manic-depressive psychosis.  He also examines the role of insanity within literature, examining writings of such figures as Edgar Allen Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville, among others of course.  Data from successive censuses taken in various countires seem to support Torrey's conclusions that insanity is indeed increasing, though with the era of deinstitutionalization this becomes more difficult to prove.  Thus, according to Torrey, this issue may be covered up, because where formerly patients were admitted to asylums today they are not.  Explanations for this increase have traditionally varied.  Torrey also discusses some of the theories as to the causes of insanity - all biological, including genetics, stress, and environmental factors, as well as toxins and microbes in the environment.  While the warnings in this book may appear alarmist, this book offers an informative introduction to the issue of insanity, which continues to plague the modern world despite its ancient origins.  As a history text this book is good in that it reveals some of the developments which were responsible for the birth of modern day psychiatry and the state mental institution or asylum.  Perhaps we can see in insanity, a reflection of the larger struggles of civilization as it makes its way from its birth pangs in ancient times, to its growth development, and eventual old age and decline.	2004-04-24
US	50058656	R34RNKY94QWHJ8	1890318043	238904691	The Apocalypse of Being : The Esoteric Gnosis of Martin Heidegger	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	Heidegger's Esoteric Gnosis:  Sein Revealed in Being.	_The Apocalypse of Being_ by Thomist philosopher Mario Enrique Sacchi is an attempt to come to terms with Martin Heidegger's thinking on being and his revilement of classical Western metaphysics and to provide a critique of that thinking in terms of Scholastic philosophy.  Heidegger regarded himself as a thinker on being, and made use of the term Sein (a German word translated roughly as \\"the act of Being\\") which he believed was concealed in being.  To Heidegger, the Western metaphysical tradition had forgotten about Sein and it was to this forgetting that he turned his attention, in for example his greatest work _Sein und Zeit_.  According to Sacchi, this revilement of classical metaphysics and first philosophy in fact rests upon a misunderstanding of Heidegger's.  Thus, much of this work is spent defending the classical tradition from the light of Thomistic philosophy against Heidegger's radical critique.  Sacchi argues that Heidegger's understanding of Sein degrades reason (calling to mind Luther's remark that reason is \\"the devil's prostitute\\" - recall that Luther was an important influence on Heidegger) as a means for ascertaining truth and turns towards a revelation in the thinking of Martin Heidegger himself.  Heidegger rejects metaphysics as onto-theology (echoing the critique of Kant in his _Critique of Pure Reason_); however, Heidegger's thinking itself would come to reembrace metaphysics.  Sacchi argues that Heidegger attempted to revise the paganism of Parmenedes against the Christian understanding of classical metaphysics in the form of Thomism and that Heidegger's insistence that his Sein is not to be understood as God, makes his thinking fundamentally atheistic.  Here, the idealist/realist divide comes into play, and Sacchi will argue that Heidegger's thinking turns invariably towards idealism (e.g. Hegelianism) as against the realism of classical metaphysics and first philosophy.  Heidegger's later thinking under the influence of poetics (ranging from Rilke to Holderlin's pantheistic neopaganism) becomes increasingly convoluted, and Heidegger himself will begin to emerge as an esoteric gnostic proclaiming a special revelation and un-concealment of Sein within history.  Sacchi makes some interesting parallels between Heidegger's particular formulations of language and those of apocalyptic (apocalypsis:  meaning \\"to reveal\\") writers of the first and second centuries AD and BC.  This book is interesting in that it provides a fascinating critique at a figure who has remained problematic for many.  Sacchi maintains a Thomistic outlook and thus shows that although Heidegger's thinking must ultimately be rejected (as possibly incoherent as well) it does contain some interesting insights into the un-concealment of Sein.	2004-04-18

Written by famous German Roman Catholic rightist, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, and published by Christendom Press, _Liberty or Equality?_ consists of reflections on the nature of liberty and the same opposition to democracy as seen in Kuehnelt-Leddihn's later work _Leftism Revisited_.  Kuehnelt-Leddihn who describes himself as a \\"liberal of the far right\\" argues against the dangers of leftism and the herdist mentality found in democracy and totalitarianism.  Many others have written on the dangers inherent in democracy including such notables as Plato and Alexis de Toqueville.  Kuehnelt-Leddihn also turns his attention to monarchy which he strongly affirms, arguing that the king is in many ways a father to his people.  Kuehnelt-Leddihn bases his arguments chiefly on those of Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic saints as well as the teaching of the popes, and shows an affinity for this philosopher although rejecting the excesses of neoThomism.  Next, the book turns its attention to an examination of the Catholic countries.  Here, the presence of revolutionary elements, including anarchism and assassination, within Catholic countries (as well as those of Eastern Orthodoxy) is mentioned, including Spain and Italy, but also Russia and the Slavic nations.  Kuehnelt-Leddihn notes that according to Aquinas tyrannicide may be justifiable, and that certain other saints allow for this possibility, while Lutheranism and other Protestant theologies distinctly reject it.  Anarchism (which like the Catholic ecclesiastical nations also bears the black flag) plays an important part in the thought of Kuehnelt-Leddihn who shows much affinity for liberty and anarchy in this form.  Indeed, an entire discussion is devoted to the Spanish anarchists, and perhaps an attempt is made to combine anarchism and monarchism with traditionalist Catholicism.  The book concludes with two chapters dealing with Protestantism, the Reformation, and the rise of the National Socialists.  Kuehnelt-Leddihn argues that the National Socialists can trace their ancestry back to Jan Hus, Czech rebel and heretic who was burned at the stake in the Middle Ages, and subsequent influence on Martin Luther (although to what extent this may be is undetermined).  Luther himself may have strongly influenced Nazism and it is shown that the Lutheran nations and parts of Germany (as well as those of a Calvinist persuasion) voted in a much stronger block for the Nazis than did the Roman Catholics in the south of Germany, and Bavaria.  Luther may also have played a role in the rise of modern democracy; however, the role of Luther as a reformer has been greatly misunderstood by the modern era.  It is often believed, particularly by liberal Protestants, that Luther represented a force of Enlightenment and liberalism against the backwards excesses of the Roman Catholic church and the papacy.  However, in fact, this is not true.  Luther represented merely a reaction against the Renaissance humanism which had made its way into the church and its theology.  Indeed, for Luther a non-Christian could not attain salvation, while for the Catholic it is possible that God could save a non-Christian through a special grace, for example.  Since Kuehnelt-Leddihn is well versed in the writings of Martin Luther as well as in Roman Catholic theology, this is a particular strong point of the book; although he later would come to change some of these reflections on Luther in _Leftism Revisited_ for example.  The book concludes with an analysis of the Nazis and the influence of the Czechs on the Nazis, etc. as well as a postscript written by the author in the 1990s.  In sum, this book is an excellent work which contains many deep and scholarly insights, complete with detailed footnotes for closer study and examination, which reveals an incredibly wide depth and breadth of learning.  Like his other works, _The Menace of the Herd_ written under the name Samuel Francis Campbell and _Leftism Revisited_, _Liberty or Equality?_ offers an important contribution to political thought and unique insights regarding freedom, democracy, egalitarianism, monarchy, anarchy, Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism.	2004-04-17

Flowers, _The Secret of the Runes_ is a unique work by the German Ariosophist and Volkish rune magician Guido (von) List.  Guido von List was an important figure among occultists and Pan Germanic nationalists who borrowed from the Theosophy of Madame H. P. Blavatsky as well as ancient Aryan (Teutonic and Indian) legend to create a unique system of rune magic.  From his childhood days, Guido List was prone to mystical fantasy, and at a young age visited the catacombs under the Saint Stephen's Cathedral in his native Vienna and declared that he would build a Temple to Wotan there.  Taking his inspiration from early Germanic religion (Wotanism, or Wuotanism) including references from Tacitus and the Eddas, neoromanticism, and later incorporating elements from Theosophy, Guido List developed a system of Armanenism which was supposedly the earliest belief system of the Germanic (Aryan) tribes.  In this book, Guido List explains the role of the runes in uncovering early Germanic belief.  An important substructure underlying von List's conceptions is his baptism into Roman Catholicism, which he believes serves as a cover for more ancient pagan beliefs which have been subsumed by Christianity.  List shows the importance of the runes and the unique meaning of each of the runic elements.  Subsequently he shows how the runes were incorporated into such systems as heraldry, freemasonry, folk tradition and belief, and even into baked goods and pastries, as well as holidays.  List notes that early Germanic (Aryan) society consisted of individuals who served as farmers with three principal classes (castes), that of the peasantry, the military, and the nobility/intellegentsia (Armanen).  List defines an occult doctrine in which he outlines what Flowers translates as the \\"biune-bifidic-dyad\\", the \\"triune-trifidic-triad\\", and the \\"multifidic multiune-multiplicity\\".  List shows how each of these relates to God and the need for man to conform his will (his ego) to that of God.  List also presents a system of reincarnation in which Aryan individuals fallen in battle are taken up into Walhalla.  In fact, List himself was to write another important novel named _Carnuntum_ dealing with the Germans under the Roman empire as well as encounter an individual named Tarnhari who was a supposed reincarnation of an Aryan chieftain.  List incorporated racial notions of Aryan supremacy into his writings and of course was politically aligned with Pan German nationalists who wanted to see Austria united with the other Germanies.  List's ideas were used to found a masonic society, which later was to embrace National Socialism.  Subsequently, many indidividuals associated with National Socialism and the NSDAP were to examine List's ideas and writings and find them interesting in furthering their own agenda.  Hopefully, further materials of List's will be made available in English one day; however, currently this remains one of the few available items for those interested in studying this individual, Volkish prophet and Ariosophist in the late Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries.	2004-04-11

Made available through the Esalen-Lindisfarne Library of Russian Philosophy, this volume contains two essays _The Holy Grail_ and _The Eucharist_ of Russian philosopher and Orthodox priest Father Sergius Bulgakov as well as some commentary by the translator Boris Jakim, an introduction by Byzantine Catholic priest Father Robert Slesinski, and two excellent afterwards expounding on Bulgakov's ideas by Constantin Andronokov and Caitlin Matthews.  Father Sergius Bulgakov was a fascinating figure in Russian philosophy who began as a Marxist and developed through German idealism until eventually embracing Orthodoxy and becoming a priest.  Along with Vladimir Solovyov and Pavel Florensky, Bulgakov remains one of the most important Sophiologists (theosophists of the Divine Sophia) of the modern era, although he was often accused of heretical leanings and Gnostic tendencies.  The essays contained in this volume are as follows.<br />_The Holy Grail_.  \\"one of the soldiers pierced his side and forthwith there came thereout blood and water.\\"  - from the Gospel of Saint John.<BR>As a religious symbol the Holy Grail represents the chalice of blood which Joseph of Arimathea obtained from the body of Christ upon the piercing of his side by the spear of the Roman centurion Longinus.  Bulgakov explains how this symbol played an important role in medieval society within both Latin and Eastern traditions, although frequently looked at somewhat askew by prominent clergy.  According to legend, Christ was crucified atop the Mount of Golgotha where the head of Adam was supposedly buried.  Bulgakov notes that within the Eastern churches it is believed that a drop of Christ's precious blood fell upon Adam's head thus saving him.  Joseph of Arimathea is believed to have taken the chalice to Glastonbury in Britain and to have started a church there according to certain Western traditions.  This essay is an excellent piece which explains the importance of the Holy Grail, and how it comes to embody the entire world, which is redeemed through Christ's salvific blood.  Bulgakov concludes by noting the apocalyptic implications of this legend in particular as it relates to modern Russia and mentions the quasi-Christian thinker Nikolai Fyodorov who wanted to use technology to restore the dead to life.<br />_The Eucharist_.  In this piece Bulgakov challenges the traditional scholastic Catholic interpretation of the Eucharist as transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood of Christ.  Bulgakov compares Catholic (as well as Protestant, e.g. consubstantiation of Luther) and Eastern (patristic) notions of the Eucharist and notes the importance of the Eucharist for Eastern theology.  According to Bulgakov, the Eucharist should be understood in terms of transmutation (calling to mind alchemy, perhaps?) of bread and wine into body and blood of Christ, so that the consumption of the Eucharistic meal plays a role in the consecration.  Bulgakov concludes with mention of the Sophiological role in the Eucharist, mentioning his unique Sophiological theories of Christ's incarnation as well as the incarnation and resurrection of the Mother of God, Mary.  I believe this essay is somewhat weaker than the other one, and tend to agree with Father Slesinksi's assessment of it, in that Bulgakov ignores an important component in the notion of transubstantiation.  Nevertheless, this essay is interesting for any reader, either Catholic or Orthodox, to understand.	2004-04-10

Smith traces the origins of the cult of Yahweh (YHWH) in ancient Israel based on archeological and textual material.  Mark S. Smith focuses upon the rise of Yahweh and Israelite monotheism (monolatry) in ancient Israel.  The cult of Yahweh is opposed to that of the cults of other Canaanite and Mesopotamian deities including El, Baal, and Asherah.  Separate chapters are devoted to Yahweh and Baal and Yahweh and Asherah (an early Canaanite goddess, contrasted with YHWH).  The origins of Yahweh are revealed in cultic practices as related to solar worship, family worship and cultic veneration of the dead (\\"feeding the dead\\" and \\"communing with the dead\\"), as well as with the asherah (symbolized by the sacred tree) and the moloch (MLK) sacrifice (a sacrifice of the children to appease the deity).  The development of the Yahweh cult through the monarchic period and as mentioned in the prophets and exilic period is fully worked out.  The book comes to reveal how Yahweh gained supremacy so as to be before all other deities (indeed, supreme deity and One as the Godhead of the entire universe).  Whether the conclusions that are reached in this book can be trusted in the light of Holy Tradition is of course a different matter entirely.  Nevertheless, the book is a useful look at the origins of Yahweh-supremacy within the religious millieu of ancient Israel (the ancient Near East) based on evidence from Stone Age and Iron Age material as well as from early textual (biblical) sources.	2004-04-07

The authors contend that Hitlerian and Nazi philosophy have their roots not only in such individuals as Malthus, Darwin, Gobineau, and Nietzsche, but also in Nazi medicine, euthanasia, and the psychiatric establishment.  Psychiatry has a difficult history and often it has sought to merge with both the eugenics movements and the criminal justice system of the day.  This book details some of the dark goings on of the business of psychiatric enslavement, forced druggings, behavioral modification therapies, electroshock and insulin therapies, psychosurgeries such as lobotomy, and even castration and finally euthanasia.  Those deemed \\"mentally ill\\" are all too often deprived of their rights and denied the ability to function in the world at large.  The authors show how psychiatry has made its way into psychology through individuals such as Wilhelm Wundt and later the behaviorists and into mainstream education through John Dewey and American society.  One particularly problematic area is that of drug use.  Originally drugs were given to soldiers subsequent to the world wars.  However, when these soldiers became addicted, a \\"War on Drugs\\" was declared.  Also, the CIA has been notorious in administering drugs to certain locations, funding undercover drug operations etc., as well as having a near fanatical obsession with the \\"psychotogen\\" LSD.  Whatever the real purpose behind LSD research is, it certainly is not a wholesome one and remains entirely mysterious.  Also, the treatment of those who had fallen in battle, or who developed a case of \\"shell shock\\" as a result of the war remains appalling.  Often the goal of the psychiatrist was simply to \\"snap\\" the individual back into a state suitable to go out and fight again (after the initial \\"snapping\\" had occurred rendering the individual in a state of shock).  Within education, traditional values have beende-emphasized and the school systems entirely re-modified.  For those who act out against this attack upon their belief systems, they are labelled as \\"prone to violence\\" or \\"overly paranoid\\".  A human genome project has been instantiated which will allow physician/technocrats to tamper with the genetic code, as well as eliminating \\"undesirable\\" genotypes.  All of this is being made possible and will consistute the Brave New World, dreamed of and heralded by prophets for many generations.  Thus, we have the negative side of the psychiatric enterprise.  In addition, psychiatry continues an assault on religion and religious belief, arguing often that religion is mere neurosis that needs to be stamped out, and that religious belief or belief in the traditional family is somehow unnecessary and needs to be \\"sloughed off\\".  On the other hand, much that psychiatry has done has improved the lives of many through designer pharmaceuticals.  Thus, in this sense, certain individuals can achieve a level of functioning they could not before by enhancing their brain chemistry.  So, it is perhaps nave to entirely buy into the argument of this book at face value.  In addition, the authors of the book are associated with the Church of Scientology - basically little more than a firm of lawyers who go about suing those who refuse to foot the bill for L. Ron Hubbard's insane operation.  In this sense it is probably not to be fully trusted.  Also, no mention is made of the attrocities of psychiatry within Stalin's Russia.  For example, all too frequently those deemed \\"unfit for work\\" were herded off to labor camps as part of a psychiatric state based apparatus in the former Soviet Union.  I still give this book five stars however because of the disturbing nature of its contents, all too often denied and misunderstood by the mainstream presses of today. ...	2004-04-03

Vol. 10).	_Civilization in Transition_ is Vol. 10 in the Collected Works of famous psychoanalyst Carl Jung.  This volume consists of a series of essays and reflections by the doctor dealing with the nature of civilization, and modern man in relation to history, as well as the unique role of Jungian psychology in explaining both political and social trends within man.  Jungian psychology includes notions of ego and archetype (anima and animus, and the shadow persona), as well as the unconscious and the collective unconscious (which contains ancestral memories preserved as archetypes).  Much of the Jungian process can be understood as the attempt to integrate the abandoned contents of the shadow (the dark unconscious side of the personality) and achieve what is termed \\"individuation\\".  Others have written linking Jungian psychology to Christian belief arguing that the process of individuation can be understood in terms of Saint Paul's putting on of the new man.  Thus, Christianity plays an important part in the role of Jungian psychology and many of its most ardent adherents are indeed Christians of sorts.  The book is divided into seven parts and an appendix.  The first part consists of essays on \\"The Role of the Unconscious\\", \\"Mind and Earth\\" (emphasizing the cthonic nature of the Germanic mind and contrasting this to the mind of nomadic or Semitic peoples), \\"Archaic Man\\" (revealing the nature of taboo and what is naively dismissed as superstition), and \\"The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man\\".  The second part deals with problems encountered within the modern world including \\"The Love Problem of a Student\\", \\"Woman in Europe\\" (which includes a description of the modern versus the medieval marriage with remarks about the anima/animus syzygy), as well as essays entitled \\"The Meaning of Psychology for Modern Man\\" and \\"The State of Psychotherapy Today\\" dealing with Jungian interpretations of modern day man.  The third part deals mostly with the events of the World War.  Here, essaysdealing with \\"Contemporary Events\\" as well as an important essay entitled \\"Wotan\\" (which shows how the old Nordic pre-Christian deity lies behind the Germanic peoples and their battles) and two essays dealing with the catastrophe of the Third Reich entitled \\"After the Catastrophe\\" and \\"The Fight with the Shadow\\" (about German war guilt and collective guilt).  The fourth section consists of the published volume _The Undiscovered Self (Present and Future)_ which deals with the plight of the individual in modern day society and the role of religion in that society in the West.  The fifth section consists of an intereresting piece entitled _Flying Saucers:  A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies_ which deals with both the psychological myth behind these saucers (the need for integration and wholeness manifested through an apocalyptic scenario).  The sixth section contains essays dealing with \\"A Psychological View of Conscience\\" (dealing with the subtle problem of conscience as the \\"vox Dei\\"), \\"Good and Evil in Analytical Psychology\\", and an introduction by Toni Wolff.  The seventh section includes reviews of writings by Count Hermann Keyserling, the social philosopher and obscurantist, as well as a piece on American psychology showing the influence of both the Negro (the problem of &quot;going black&quot; for the European) and the Indian on the American psyche, and two pieces on the psychology of India contrasting it with the European.  An Appendix is included which includes various letters and addresses of the psychotherapeutic societies as well as Jung's particular remarks on the \\"Jewish problem\\", in which he notes the distinction between Jewish (Semitic) and European psychological make-ups.  This volume is particularly interesting for all those who are intent on studying the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung and his school of thought.  While Jung himself often defies proper categorization within a traditional religious perspective, many within the traditional religions have seen value in his work and writings and have incorporated what he has written into their therapeutic practices.<br />Also of interest:  By Baron Julius Evola, _Revolt Against the Modern World_.	2004-04-02

Various scenes from the Stations of the Cross, the Catholic tradition, and references from Scripture are incorporated into this piece so as to show the true nature of Christ's Passion, and the mystery of his sacrifice for us all.  This book is truly unique and an important companion piece to Mel Gibson's movie.  As with the earlier Greek mystery plays, Christianity arose as a religion of mystery the church being endowed with the necessary chrism to enact the Seven Sacraments.  One particular mystery that played an important part in early Christianity and in the churches of the Middle Ages was that of the Passion Play, an initiatory piece of theater in which the Christian catechumen was brought into oneness with the Church through the suffering and death of Christ, Jesus upon the Cross.  With the coming Easter season, we can only begin to hope for renewed life.  Hopefully, this book will lead many on a contemplative ascent into the mysteries of suffering through that of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ.	2004-03-31

Sherrard begins by discussing the conversion of the Roman empire to Christendom under Constantine the Great and shows how with this conversion Christianity became rooted as the officially sanctioned state religion of the Roman empire, thus linking the spiritual domain to temporal power.  Sherrard shows how out of the philosophies of ancient Greece, in particular Plato and Aristotle, the notion of the state was changed so that what was once anarchistic and irrational became firmly rooted in such Roman philosopher-statesmen as Senecca and Cicero.  Much of the first chapter on the Roman background is spent discussing Platonism and Plato's theory of ideal forms which operates specifically within the theological background of early Christian thinkers including Origen.  The second chapter of this book is devoted to The Advent and Form of Christianity.  Sherrard has been heavily influenced by both the traditionalist school of Rene Guenon and the theory of the transcendent unity of religions of Frithjof Schuon, and both are seen to play an important part in his discussion of earliest Christianity.  Christianity was given form so as to maintain the sanctity of its mysteries which are encodified in the creeds given from the councils.  The nature of God and the relationship of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Filioque controversy is discussed by Sherrard in this account.  Sherrard shows the difference between Latin interpretation of the Filioque which argues that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, and the Greek/Eastern interpretation which argues that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone.  This conflict between Greek and Latin interpretations was to be played out in a schismatic breach which occurred between Rome and the Eastern Patriarchate.  While Sherrard notes that true schism within the church (the church being truly catholic) is impossible, what was witnessed here was a certain falling away from faith.  The rise of Byzantium as the source for the Eastern tradition plays an important role in forming an understanding of the conflict between Latin and Greek forms of Christianity, as well as the influence of Islam and the Sultan on the Eastern churches.  Next, Sherrard precedes to a discussion of the Roman papacy and contrasts this with the temporal rulership by the Byzantine emperor, within the Eastern version of the Christianity.  Finally, Sherrard notes the distinction between Greek theology and that of the Latin Fathers Augustine or Aquinas and notes the contrast.  According to Sherrard much of the loss of mystery and disenchantment within the world can be attributed to the usurpation of theology by these Latin Fathers, who failed to properly understand the nature of the Divine.  Sherrard next turns his attention to a specific individual in the Platonic Greek tradition named Plethon who served as \\"the first of the neo-hellenizers\\".  Plethon sought to restore a tradition with roots perhaps in Zoroastrianism, Pythagoreanism, Parmenedes, Plato, and later corrupted by Aristotle, as opposed to the Greek orthodox Christian tradition.  Plethon played an important role in the formation of the modern secular and rationlist worldview.  Finally, Sherrard mentions Rene Descartes whose philosophy served as a foundation for modern scientific rationalism.  Again, Sherrard perceives Descartes to be a feature of the potential loss that has engulfed the West due to its denial of its true Christian roots.  Sherrard also turns his attention to Protestantism and the Enlightenment, both of which he finds problematic.  This book offers an excellent account of the contrast between Greek orthodox and Latin Christianity from the perspective of a Greek orthodox philosopher/theologian.  With roots in the traditionalist school of thought, Philip Sherrard offers the reader in the modern world a unique opportunity to look for a restoration of the perennial philosophy within modern thought.hought, Philip Sherrard offers the reader in the modern world a unique opportunity to look for a restoration of the perennial philosophy within modern thought.	2004-03-26

US	50058656	R2DQXTMCIYX81R	0674036468	461888556	Andrei Bely: The Major Symbolist Fiction (RUSSIAN RESEARCH CENTER STUDIES)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Andrei Bely - Russian Symbolist.	_Andrei Bely:  The Major Symbolist Fiction_ by Vladimir E. Alexandrov is an important biographical work dealing with one of Russia's more interesting novelists.  In the tradition of the French and European symbolists, beginning perhaps with Baudelaire and Huysmanns, and in that of the early Russian symbolists including Valery Briusov (_The Fiery Angel_ (1907)), Dmitry Merezhkovsky (the trilogy _Christ or Antichrist_), and Fedor Sologub (_The Petty Demon_ (1907)), Andrei Bely (a sobriquet meaning \\"Andrew White\\") became an important writer in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Russia.  Born Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev (1880 - 1934), Bely came to write under this particular name after being given it by a relative of the famous philosopher Vladimir Soloviev.  Bely has been ranked with Joyce, Kafka, and Proust as one of the most important figures of European Modernism by the likes of Nabokov.  This particular biographical book takes a look at the principal works of Bely including his _Symphonies_, and the novels _The Silver Dove_ (1909), _Petersburg_ (1913 - 14; 1922), _Kotik Letaev_ (1917 - 18), and _The Baptized Chinaman_ (1921).  Bely frequently met with censorship from the offical Soviet bureaucracy and thus was routinely forced to hide or delete various components within his novels.<BR> Symbolism entails a tie between man and the transcendent.  In Bely's principle works, this can be seen in both his appeal to esoteric and occult doctrines, as well as his emphasis upon the imminent apocalypse and Solovievian eschatology (including that of the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition).  Some of Bely's earliest works include _The Symphonies_, which were influenced heavily by the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Eduard von Hartmann, as well as the playwright Ibsen, and later Nietzsche (in particular his _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ and the idea of the \\"superman\\", indeed for Bely a reconcilliation is attempted between the eternal recurrence of Nietzsche and Christianity, with self-overcoming referring perhaps to Christ himself).  Bely also was heavily indebted to the philosopher Vladimir Soloviev whose Sophiology and apocalyptic narrative within a Christian/Gnostic context played an important role in shaping the early Bely, as well as the poet and fellow follower of Soloviev, Aleksandr Blok.  In many of these pieces termed _The Symphonies_ reference is made to the philosophy of Soloviev, whom Bely regarded as the next step beyond Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.  Later Bely would also come to embrace the German philosopher Kant, as well as Schelling.<BR> For Bely, the novels _The Silver Dove_, _Petersburg_, and _Kotik Letaev_ were originally intended to form a sort of trilogy.  However, though each subsequent novel was to incorporate details from the last the trilogy idea would eventually not be used.  _The Silver Dove_ involves an occult and apocalyptic confrontation among a secret society referred to as \\"the Doves\\" who intend to give birth to a child which is the incarnation of Sophia, divine wisdom, from Solovievian philosophy.  The influence of evil forces and indeed of Satanism, plays an important part in this novel.  _Petersburg_ involves the story of a confrontation between a revolutionary son and his conservative/aristocratic father.  The son in this novel intends to use a bomb to murder his father.  An important theme in this work is that of apocalypse, in the form of the \\"yellow peril\\", a pan-Mongol invasion of Russia, as prophesied by Soloviev in his writings on Antichrist.  Both _The Silver Dove_ and _Petersburg_ are particularly influenced by the ideals of anthroposophy, a system devised by Rudolf Steiner.  Indeed, during this time period, Bely was to come particularly under the spell of Steiner, and would later serve as an advisor in the construction of the Goethenaeum for students of Steiner.  _Kotik Letaev_ and its sequel _The Baptized Chinaman_ feature the life of Bely as a youth influenced by Steinerian anthroposophy andattainment of higher states of consciousness.  Again, the theme of the Mongol invasion plays an important role (as seen in _The Baptized Chinaman_, where the author as a child refers to his father as a \\"baptized Chinaman\\").<BR> Bely is a fascinating figure and remains an enigma for many who attempt to understand Russian symbolism.  To understand Bely, one must be versed in the occult doctrines of Rudolf Steiner and his esoteric science (as well as his understanding of higher dimensions and higher states of consciousness), as well as the esoteric Christianity and gnosticism of Vladimir Soloviev, whose Sophiology was to play such an important role in the writings of Bely.  This biography is an excellent introduction to the work of Bely, who remains an important figure among Russian modernist writers.	2004-03-19

The book includes a vast array of material from various beliefs which have arisen in a post-Enlightenment West which increasingly experiences the pressures of globalization and decline, c.f. Spengler.  Much of the esoteric material presented within this book consists of belief systems which offer a reaction to modernity (either by looking directly back to a distant past or a vanished culture or civilization, attempting to import systems of knowledge from distant cultures, in particular the East, or by attempting to merge ancient belief with modern day science and rationalism).  Olav Hammer's book is full of details about these various belief systems and offers much of comparison and contrast between the unique systems ranging from the Theosophy of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky carried on by Annie Bessant, Charles Webster Leadbeater, and Alice Bailey, the Anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner, the psychoanalysis and depth psychology of Carl Gustav Jung (with precursors in mesmerism), the Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT) of Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the experiences of occultist and psychic Edgar Cayce, various attempts to merge science with the occult through spiritism and the opposition of spiritism and \\"skepticism\\" (of the various skeptical societies, for example), attempts to merge modern day Darwinian evolution with esoteric belief, and attempts to merge modern day physics and cosmology (in particular Quantum Mechanics, but also the Theory of Relativity) with various esoteric beliefs, New Age philosophies ranging from those of _The Aquarian Conspiracy_ of Marilyn Ferguson to _The Celestine Prophecy_ of James Redfield, and various New Age beliefs about crystals, auras, chakras, and personal growth and transformation through healing.  Much of what is presented here falls into categories.  For example, often lost civilizations and distant cultures are used as sources of tradition for constructed esoteric and New Age belief systems.  These include lost civilizations such as those of the legendary Atlantis or ancient Egypt and Tibet, as well as distant cultures such as those of the Orient or even the Native Americans, Aztecs, or Mayans.  Also, various forms of healing are discussed frequently within the book.  These include methods often excluded from the mainstream Western medical community.  A particular case is that of the Indian medical doctor Deepak Chopra who offers a system of New Age healing and healthy mindedness.  In many ways, much of these methods of healing can be related to the discussion of the \\"Religion of Healthy Mindedness\\" found in some of William James' works (in particular see _The Varieties of Religious Experiences_).  In an attempt to re-enchant science, which is believed to be fallen from the Naturphilosophie of the 18th century to pure materialism and rationalism, many have opted to incorporate occult philosophies as well as vitalism into physics or biology.  In particular, the author makes an interesting discussion of the Quantum Theory, relating the standard, but inferior, Copenhagen interpretation of the collapse of the wavefunction to some of the alternatives.  At the far extreme opposed to the Copenhagen interpretation stand such ultra-idealists as Fritjof Capra and Gary Zukav (arguing that reality is in fact consciously constructed, often surpassing the idealism even of such early proponents as Bishop Berkeley and incorporating Oriental and Eastern mysticism into their interpretation).  Much of New Age belief hinges on the idea of a coming Aquarian Age and an end to the Age of Pisces (perhaps, the Age of Pisces, that of the fish, is indeed the age of Christ - Christ of course being symbolized as the fish by the earliest Christians in the catacombs, c.f. _Hamlet's Mill_ by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechand.)  In many ways, the New Age movement is similar to that of the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, with an emphasis on individual experience.  Thus, the author will provide several case studies including details of healing practices, Jungian psychotherapy, past lives therapy, and reincarnation as useful interludes emphasizing individual experience.  Within medicine the school of Anton Mesmer is important for its role in the discovery of the unconscious, later formulated explicitly by Eduard von Hartmann, a disciple of Schopenhauer.  There is much more contained in this book from what has been laid out here, and the book offers a complete bibliography including many of the different movements which have played a unique role in shaping modern day esoteric belief systems.  The author contrasts etic and emic historiography, demonstrating how what the particular belief system offers as its own history or traces as its own tradition may not always hold up under the rigorous standards of scholarship from within the academy.  Still, I believe that much that is present here is indeed uniquely valueable for any student of religious beliefs, alternative beliefs, hidden or lost knowledge, or with a general interest in the esoteric, the occult, or the modern day New Age.<br />For an alternative perspective on the New Age movement, written from a somewhat reactionary point of view, with basis in the Traditionalist school of Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon consult the work _The System of Antichrist_ by Charles Upton.	2004-03-17

The book is translated with help from the traditionalist Greek Orthodox Christian theologian Philip Sherrard, who himself was an early follower of Rene Guenon (a convert to Islam and founder of the Traditionalist School).  The book is published by the Institute for Ismaeli Studies based in London, which attempts to examine the esoteric and gnostic tradition within the theological and religious heritage of Islam.  The book is divided into two parts splitting up the tradition with the death of Averroes.  The first section of the book is devoted to showing the uniqueness of the Quran as the primary study tool for Islamic philosophers.  Indeed, interpretation of the Quran, and mystical interpretation of the hadith or tradition, plays an essential role in the understanding of Islamic mysticism.  For Muslims, there is no Magisterium (teaching authority) as there is for Christians residing in the Church.  Thus, interpretation of the Quran is subject to various rules and methods for doing so.  The author next includes sections dealing with Shiism and the Prophetic Philosophy (which involves interpretation of the Twelver Imams, gnosis, and Ismaelism), Sunni philosophy, Philosophy and the Natural Sciences (including mention of alchemy, astrology, and hermeticism), Hellenizing philosophers (including Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali - all of whom imported Plato and Aristotle to Islamic monotheism), the unique tradition of Sufism, a special section dealing with Al-Suhrawardi and the Philosophy of Light and his Illumination, and a section dealing with Andulasia ending with Averroes.  Throughout this discussion of the various traditions within Islam we see the influence of gnosticism as well as of the other Abrahamic religions and \\"peoples of the Book\\" (Jews, Christians, and Muslims), and the influence of Zoroastrianism (with its dualistic worldview), as well as the influence of even Hinduism and Buddhism to a lesser extent.  The book concludes with the modern period after the death of Averroes of Islamic philosophy including reference to Sunnis, Sufis, and Shiites.  Indeed, for the author Shiism and Sufism seem to play an especial role in his understanding of the uniqueness of Islamic philosophy.  In sum, this book offers a very good introduction to Islamic philosophy and its history from an esotericist's perspective.  Metaphysics is too often cast aside in the West; however, by importing the rich metaphysical traditions from the East which often include original Greek elements, such as the Islamic tradition, a proper restoration of this ancient philosophical discipline can be attained.  If you are interested in Islamic mysticism and metaphysics in particular you might want to also consult the works of Seyyed Hossein Nasr as well as anything issuing from the Traditionalist School (originally founded by such individuals as Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon).other Abrahamic religions and \\"peoples of the Book\\" (Jews, Christians, and Muslims), and the influence of Zoroastrianism (with its dualistic worldview), as well as the influence of even Hinduism and Buddhism to a lesser extent.

If you have ever had problems with anxieties, fears, paranoia, manias, hallucinations, visions, confusion, catatonia, or delusional thinking, then maybe this book can help you.  I generally don't really believe in diagnosis (other than as the only tool currently available to get insurance companies to pay for psychiatric medications), but at various points in my life (probably at 8 different points, 6 of which lasted for over a month) I have experienced rather severe existential crises (otherwise known as psychotic breaks) beginning at age 21 and have usually been advised to see a doctor by a family member.  I have tried different psychiatric medicines, and have generally found that antipsychotics combined with depakote seem to work best for me.  I'm sure that I have a mild case compared to many and indeed I count myself fortunate for that.  Generally though I find myself somewhat less secure (in existential terms) in my being than most.  Also, I can relate to some of what is written here, particularly regarding thought disorders (thought blocking and such) which I have at various times tried to describe in terms of \\"brainwashing\\", \\"thought control\\", \\"feeling other people's feelings\\", or other terms.  I have also experienced what I like to call \\"robot mind\\", a sort of out of body experience where the soul seems to separate from the body, and routinely draw diagrams of individuals trying to understand the \\"control relations\\" between them.  I believe these constitute some of the more common forms of thought confusion found in severe depressions, under stress, or as part of a psychotic break.  Generally, I live existentially apart from most other people, sometimes almost entirely within my own world.  Although I can still function, hold down a job, and go to school, though I am very introverted.  If you can relate to any of this then maybe this book will help you, although you probably have sought other means by now to relieve your life crisis.  _Surviving Schizophrenia_ is written with a great deal of compassion, from the perspective of mainstream psychiatry.  I can't say that I agree with everything in it, or even with its largely scientistic bias (I tend to think in terms of mystical experiences and religion, though my training is in the hard sciences originally), but it may provide some useful guidance if you are prone to these sorts of existential conflicts or if you know a loved one who is so.  You may find it helpful also to consult some of the available literature on mysticism as well as working through art and literature to relieve the tension of your so called \\"illness\\".  I have found in particular my religion, Roman Catholicism, the works of Carl Jung, and Gurdjieff, as well as the writings of Julian Jaynes to be useful (at least interesting) in framing my understanding about certain things and experiences which I have undergone.  Otherwise, the book is useful at least in that it attempts to categorize illness, is written with compassion, and gives advice on various psychiatric medications and designer pharmaceuticals which have tended to improve life for millions.  Although this illness can indeed completely &quot;ruin&quot; a life, it is perhaps more positive to think in terms of &quot;transformation&quot;.

If you have ever seen any of Albrecht Durer's woodcuts on the Apocalypse or have read the works of Swedenborg and can relate to the central figures, then perhaps this book is one you might find helpful.  If you have experienced what is colloquially called \\"madness\\" or frequently undergo mystical experiences which a doctor has told you constitute a psychotic disorder, then I believe that reading this book may be profitable to you.  The book relates several tales of individuals and their experience with the mental health establishment.  The book is written from an \\"anti-psychiatry\\" perspective and includes commentary by Seth Farber and Thomas Szasz (famous libertarian) on the dangers of the mental health system, the harm it has done to many sensitive souls, and the psychiatric survivor's organizations and mental health liberation leagues which have fought coercive treatment.  (I generally tend to be somewhat sympathetic to the point of view of the author, although I'm not sure that it would hold true for all individuals and I do believe that medicines and drugs can sometimes be helpful.  Afterall, it is very painful to be truly \\"awake\\", wakefulness takes energy and thus drains the body, so if you are fully awake all the time you probably will need a medication to sedate you.)  If you have ever experienced hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions, and believed they have been improperly handled by a psychiatrist or in a mental health facility then perhaps you can recognize some of what is discussed in this book.  My personal experience is this.  I went to a very select and intensive math and science academy for undergraduate school and many individuals and friends of mine underwent severe crises and breakdowns as a result of the stress.  I have undergone several breakdowns myself or existential crises and have had my fair share of otherwise \\"mystical experiences\\".  I believe that this sort of thing is not adequately understood by modern science which is biased in a materialistic, scientistic manner.  In particular, for example, I believe that the soul can be severed from the body and the body can become a mere \\"puppet\\" or \\"robot\\" during extreme stress.  A psychiatrist has described this experience as &quot;psychotic\\"; however, a quick perusal of most ancient religious sources will show it to be a fairly common one.  If you have these sorts of experiences, believe you have ESP for example, or feel that you can communicate with angels, that the television may speak directly to you, or that God talks to you, then you are not \\"abnormal\\" as a psychiatrist or mainstream society may say.  Rather, you may merely be a particularly sensitive individual who picks up cues from his environment and perhaps has access to higher levels of being, other dimensions (read for example the book _Flatland_ by Edwin Abbot), or even parallel universes.  I believe that the brain is like an antenna that can be tuned to different radio stations (a spike on the energy graph which is \\"you\\") and may occassionally pick up some static.  Unlike the author however, I disagree with him about the role of psychiatric medications.  While it is true that many of these medications do have certain harmful side effects they can be helpful in certain ways.  For example, speaking for myself I know that without the drug depakote I am nervous as a cat, paranoid, believe that people are talking about me, have ideas of reference, cannot sleep, do not want to eat, and sometimes cannot even leave the house.  With it I have the side effect of cotton mouth and feel sluggish, but otherwise I believe the drug does calm my nerves.  So in this sense I feel it may be good for me, despite its long term side effects (a chance I am willing to take, for the peace of mind it seems to offer me now).  The choice of course is entirely up to you as far as medications go and they do not work for all people.  Otherwise, this book offers an excellent opportunity to examine the role of mystical experience in the lives of those deemed mentally ill and looks at some individuals who are at the higher functioning level of mental illness.  Mental illness I believe may ultimately be a disease of civilization.  The pressures of social conformity work their way into the minds of people and ultimately cause them to undergo breakdowns, breakthroughs, or transformations.  Afterall, civilization has certain cracks.<br />Also of interest:  If you are interested I suggest you consult the book _Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_ by the late Professor Julian Jaynes, which is one of the most mind-shattering books I have ever read in explaining consciousness.	2004-02-26

Many Americans today worship at the feet of FDR, regarding him as the father of social security.  However, as this book shows, FDR was a virtual tyrannt able to manipulate this country into a war entangling us in European affairs against the better advice of all the Founding Fathers, including George Washington in his Farewell Address of 1796.  And, to accomplish this manipulation he and his government were not afraid to resort to some of the most vicious forms of propaganda, including staging a \\"Moscow show trial\\" in which political dissidents and \\"crackpots\\" (the phrase used by the prosecution) were rounded up and accused of encouraging members of the U.S. armed forces to mutiny.  One of these individuals who brought upon himself the ire of the Roosevelt administration and of other powerful forces within government was Lawrence Dennis, writer of several famous books dealing with the fascist revolution in America.<br />It was in light of his theories that Dennis got himself into trouble with the current powers that be.  Indeed, approximately 40 dissidents and \\"crackpots\\" were hauled up by the government in a great show trial on charges of sedition in 1944.  What was the purpose of this trial?  Dennis argues that it was purely for propaganda purposes by the Roosevelt administration and refers to it as a farce and a waste of the taxpayer's money in this book _A Trial on Trial_.  In fact, the trial did not attempt to prove the charge that the defendants had tried to make members in the armed forces mutiny, but rather instead alleged a \\"worldwide Nazi conspiracy\\" in which the defendants took part.  Dennis argues that this trial was done in the tradition of Moscow, in which the government attempted to \\"educate\\" the public on the evils of \\"anti-Semitism, isolationism, and anti-communism\\" by means of a trial.  For Dennis, he certainly could not be charged with the noxious anti-Semitic charge (still used so often today against those who propose another perspective) because his writings specifically showed the foolishness of anti-Semitism.  Dennis argued that it was particularly ironic that the defendants were often referred to by the prosecution as \\"crackpots\\", because according to the dictionary a \\"crackpot\\" is a \\"harmless lunatic\\" but in the same breath the prosecution would call them all \\"dangerous\\".<br /> But why was this trial staged at all?  According to Dennis these individuals (the \\"crackpots\\") were easy targets.  They were dissidents and quite frequently agitators who rebelled against the present order.  However, many \\"respectable\\" Americans (including certain famous \\"isolationist\\" Congressmen such as Senator Nye, John T. Flynn, and the elder Lindhbergh) also shared the views of these \\"agitators\\" but were unable or unwilling to admit this in public or to take nearly such a radical stance.  Indeed, according to Dennis it was not really the \\"crackpots\\" who were the target of the trial at all.  Rather it was the dissident but respectable Americans who Roosevelt and his cronies were after.  Afterall, by going after the \\"crackpots\\" the message to the rest of America was clear:  if you share these views you'd best keep quiet because we'll go after you next, best just to parrot the Roosevelt line in times of war.<br /> In addition, powerful Jewish groups including the freemasonic B'nai B'rith wanted the defendants prosecuted on the charge of anti-Semitism.  While many of the defendants including the individual writing under the pen name Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovich, claiming to be a Russian general of Aryan descent, were indeed virulent anti-Semites, the majority were not.  (Interestingly, the chess player Bobby Fisher attempting to understand the Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy behind international chess professionals has recommended the book by Count Cherep-Spiridovich entitled _The Secret World Government_, currently available from the Booktree publishers.)  Indeed, anti-Semitism has always existed and can hardly be calleda crime, certainly not by any legal standard within the United States and certainly not supported by the Constitution of the United States.  While it may be understandable that these Jewish groups wanted to stamp out anti-Semitism, their methods for doing so were truly Machievellian and completely without regard to civil liberties.  The same applies to the manner in which the ideologies of \\"isolationism\\" and \\"anti-communism\\" were being eradicated.<br /> It is common for those among the communists to refer to every single opponent of the official \\"Moscow line\\" as a fascist.  Indeed, the word fascist is a term of such abuse that it no longer has any meaning whatsoever.  Indeed, when the fellow communist Trotsky deviated from the official Stalin-line he suddenly became a \\"fascist\\".  So, the fascist smear is really old news and of course the left was playing this up in the sedition trial.  However, many of those who certainly could not be referred to as part of the left wing extreme or communists continued to parrot the \\"fascist line\\" unaware that they were in fact unwitting pawns for Moscow.<br /> After 6 months of unnecessary trial, the judge, worn thin from all the headache, had a heart attack and died.  The trial was subsequently declared a mistrial and the defendants were all left off the hook.  However, this trial had been a farce and a true perversion of American justice, attempting to cash in on the unanimous agreement of all Americans that fascism was a \\"bad thing\\" to persecute certain dissidents and \\"crackpots\\" who would not toe the interventionist/Roosevelt line.  Dennis subsequently went back to his work and his writing.<br />  This book, _A Trial on Trial_ presents the case point by point including the prosecutor's main arguments (or lack thereof) and sound rebuttal by the defense.  The book is co-written by Lawrence Dennis who served as his own attorney and the defense attorney Maximilian St. George.

Despite the claims of the followers of Joseph Smith, in the form of Mormonism (called \\"the American religion\\" by Leo Tolstoy), to be true Christians, this particular religion is in fact influenced more by magical rites, folk ritual, and secret masonic initation later codified into dogma by the modern Latter-Day Saints (LDS) Church in Salt Lake City, Utah.  In fact, the last words of the prophet Joseph Smith (creator of Mormonism and supposedly divinely inspired translator of the hidden _Book of Mormon_, a gnostic text, a companion piece to the _Holy Bible_ revealing the apparitions of Christ to the Native Americans, the supposed lost tribe of Israel) were in the form of the ritual masonic call of distress \\"My Lord, my God, is there no hope for the widow's son?\\", eerily calling to mind the secret initations involved in this ancient rite.  _One Nation Under God_ offers a somewhat biased account of the history of the Mormon church including the early influences on Joseph Smith (which may have been theosophical) which have been covered up by the later LDS church as well as the bloody and inglorious battles of his followers with the United States government and the rise of Brigham Young within the church after Smith's death.  The author shows some of the more startling beliefs of the original Mormons including their differences with true Christianity, their belief in multiple gods, their polygamous practices, and their early racism.  Much of the true history of this church and the founding of Utah (believed to be Zion by Mormons) has been covered up by the modern day LDS leaders who continue to perpetuate the myth of their origins.  For example early books such as _Jews in America_ (1650) by Thomas Thorowgood, _The History of the American Indians_ (1775) by James Adair, _Essay Upon the Propagation of the Gospel_ (1799) by Charles Crawford, and _A Star in the West; or, a Humble Attempt to Discover the Lost Tribes of Israel_ (1816) by Elias Boudinot all proposed the thesisthat the American Indians were the lost tribe of Israel who had come to America and may have influenced the early Joseph Smith, who at the time was influenced by the occult and the practice of folk magic in the form of money digging.  The history of the Mormon church is bloody, and prompted often by anti-establishment leanings, often advocating outright revolt against the United States government.  For example, at the Mountain Meadows Massacre many of those travelling towards the West were violently murdered by Indians turned loose upon them by LDS leaders.  This history has been conveniently covered up by the LDS church to further its power.  While this book is interesting, the alternative proposed by the author is not substantially better.  The author seems biased in the sense that he will use what dirt he can find on the Mormon religion for his polemic.  However, the author promotes an evangelical form of Protestant Christianity.  I do not believe that this form of Christianity is any better than the alternative proposed by Mormonism.  Perhaps, by a true return to the fathers of Christianity and its tradition and a step away from modern day America and the developments within the last hundred years, a proper restoration can be accomplished of this ancient faith.  Mormonism on the other hand, seems a decadent alternative and a culture-distortion of an otherwise original pure faith.  This book offers a decent history of the Church of Mormon, though it is polemical and biased in many respects.  On the other hand, the anti-establishment leanings of many Mormons seem to be interesting, in their opposition to federal power, and the tyranny of the New World Order.	2004-02-24
US	50058656	RRD3I1JHF15TV	0815604610	629616031	Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement	Books	5	37	41	N	N	Mental Illness:  A Study in Scapegoating.	_The Manufacture of Madness_ by right wing libertarian \\"anti-psychiatrist\\" Thomas Szasz is a comparative essay showing the similarity and growth of the \\"religion of mental illness\\" from the Inquisition, the persecution of heretics, and the days of witch hunting.  Szasz contends that the idea of \\"mental illness\\" is in fact a category mistake involving a false notion of \\"illness\\".  Much of this book is spent demonstrating how society in the form of the \\"mental health movement\\" seeks to root out dissenters and heretics in order to protect the reigning order (or to achieve a new scientistic based order controlled by doctor-bureaucrats - the modern day utopia of \\"the Brave New World\\").  Szasz finds notable similarity between the mental health movement and the Inquisition and persecution of witches (including the comparison made between the _DSM_ and the notorious witch hunter's manual _Malleus Maleficarum_).  Szasz observes that society has always had certain individuals who defied convention and thus posed a threat to the reigning order.  These individuals (mostly eccentrics, romantics, dreamers, dissidents, and heretics) were often rounded up by society's \\"protectors\\" and then identified as the \\"inner enemy\\" and thus conveniently \\"scapegoated\\".  Tradition held that the scapegoat served as the embodiment for all of the sins within the given enclosed society.  Thus, for Szasz, the so-called mentally ill individual is identified as an eccentric by the modern day \\"therapeutic state\\" and deemed to serve as the scapegoat for the sins of a given society through the process of forced confinement.  Those who fall too far to the right or left of the bell curve are arbitrarily deemed \\"abnormal\\" after some cutoff point and therefore forcibly confined, their civil liberties denied to them.  Often such an individual is a poor man or woman who is eccentric and lives alone.  Such a person makes an easy target for the statist \\"thought police\\" of the world of 1984.  Despite their denials of their illness, such individuals are arbitrarily declared ill and confined.  Nearly all categories within the _DSM_ have clear reference to class, race, and sex biases.  Nearly all categories can serve conveniently as a tool of the wealthy and dominant elite against the impoverished classes.  While society may deny civil liberties to certain individuals, the real problem is that it has failed to provide a way to fully integrate such eccentric individuals into its dominant structures.  Thus, Szasz seeks to re-politicize a process that is often entirely de-politicized and defined in terms of illness.  The first half of this book offers a comparative survey of mental illness and the mental health movement and the persecution of witches and heretics.  One may consult the works particularly of Norman Cohn, a historian who deals with the medieval period and some of the mass hysteria that existed at that time, for a detailed examination of this topic within Europe particularly.  However, Szasz fails to mention that the notion of madness predates the medieval period going back as far as Biblical times and being discussed by such illustrious Greeks as Aristotle and Socrates in terms of ethics.  The second half of the book deals with the manufacture of madness by what amounts to \\"mad doctors\\".  Here, the great American doctor and an important framer of the Constitution, Benjamin Rush is discussed.  Rush often viewed political conflicts in terms of illness, proving for Szasz that the notion of illness has been repeatedly abused so as to further a political agenda.  Rush's advocation of \\"cures\\" for individuals deemed to be \\"mentally ill\\" often amount to barbarous cruelty.  Psychiatry has a long, bloody, and inglorious history involving forced medication and confinement, as well as electroshock and insulin shock therapies, and \\"insane\\" psycho-surgeries, as well as a thousand other tortures.  Szasz also discusses the notions of heresy, medical stigma and scapegoating, as wellas two of the more notorious deviancies which psychiatry originally sought after:  masturbation and homosexuality.  The ridiculousness and obsession of psychiatry with these sorts of disorders which would otherwise be deemed as sinful, demonstrates the absurd lengths to which many doctors would go (supported by Freudian theory) to legitimize their practice.  For example, consider this ironically crude remark made by German physician, Werner Villinger, in the 1920s, which speaks of masturbation as \\"a snake which has to be throttled\\".  Such outbreaks of hysteria and \\"masturbatory insanity\\" were common during this era.  Szasz would argue for example that the removal of both masturbation and homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses in the _DSM_ proves that these so called \\"illnesses\\" are nothing more than social constructs reflecting the dominant morality of the era.  While I agree with Szasz on many points he makes here, I disagree with him to a certain extent.  The fact is that certain individuals pose a threat to the dominant order, either as criminals or as causing a great deal of dissent.  Also, unlike Szasz I believe that religion and the church serve a useful purpose in society and disagree violently with his secular humanistic stance and rejection of God.  The question remains however who should the notion of \\"mental illness\\" serve principally.  Should it serve the patient, should it serve the family, or should it serve society at large (which is increasingly coming to resemble a scientistic dystopia)?  In a traditionalist based society, for example, the so called \\"mentally ill\\" would be regarded as seers, prophets, or magicians and treated with reverence.  In today's world they are often treated maliciously.  Mental illness often amounts to nothing more than what traditionally was known as eccentricity, magic, religious experience, mysticism, the experience of being truly \\"awake\\", and other unusual experiences.  These experiences should not be declaredabnormal or somehow outside the human condition by a scientistic and materialist based culture.	2004-02-19

In the 1960s several different movements became prevalent which operated in direct opposition to the institution of psychiatry, which often included forced medicating, confinement, and electroshock and  psychosurgery on individuals deemed to be mentally ill.  These individuals included both leftists (radical leftists, Marxists, and other liberals) as well as libertarian rightists and those who argued for individual responsibility attempting to re-politicize the process of denying civil rights to certain individuals deemed insane, among whom were many in the psychedelic counter-culture, cult groups including Scientology, various indiduals believing themselves to have been wronged by the psychiatric establishment and often identifying themselves as psychiatric survivors, and even some prominent psychiatrists  the two most notorious such anti-psychiatrists being Thomas Szasz (libertarian rightist and opponent of coercive treatment) and R. D. Laing (whose politiics ranged from the Marxist left to the far right).  _The Wing of Madness_ is a biography of the Scottish maverick psychiatrist R. D. Laing and his contributions to our understanding of the schizoid/schizophrenic mode of being-in-the-world in terms of existentialist theory.  Laing had a strange relationship to the medical establishment beginning as a psychiatrist who developed an interest in the field possibly as a result of his own troubled upbringing (his mother frequently prone to depression and possibly psychosis and his father prone to difficult bouts as well).  Laing himself would come to embrace both traditional Christianity (in the form of Presbyterianism), but also Gnosticism and ancient mysticisms, as well as Eastern religions and philosophy, and the phenomenological philosophies of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, and the existentialism of Merleau-Ponty and Jean Paul Sartre.  For a time Laing flirted with Marxism, but later would claim that he had embraced the right (although exactly to what extent this was to be interpreted was difficult to determine).  Critics of Laing frequently argued that he idealized and romanticized madness (especially the psychotic break that occurs in schizophrenia and other schizoid type disorders).  Indeed, for Laing, madness often was an entirely reasonable attempt to deal with a difficult situation brought about particularly by stresses demanded from social conformity, economic conditions, and in particular the family life.  Indeed, for Laing the family often was a means whereby violence was inflicted upon the individual (the family revolving around several enduring myths which became cracked at the point of madness seen in schizophrenia for example).  Using these sorts of theories, Laing argued that schizophrenia and other psychotic type disorders should be allowed to follow out their course, perhaps being a stage in a process necessary for individual growth.  Thus, he opposed treatment which often included medication into a stupor, electroshock, confinement, and insulin shock therapy or in extremely difficult cases even dangerous psycho-surgeries.  At the time this was a radical position to take, which could be interpreted as one of the extreme left (arguing for the rights of the oppressed as  insane) or even as a conservative measure (arguing for a return to a time when the mentally ill were treated with less invasive measures).  Towards the end of his life, Laing moved away from some of these ideas, and perhaps turned closer towards the more generally accepted theory of a biological basis for psychosis (particularly schizophrenia, as brain disorder).  Also, Laing frequently encountered conflict with medical authority and other famous psychiatrists and thinkers and was eventually suspended from his medical practice.  Laing died playing tennis; however, before his death Laing experienced several severe bouts of depression and frequently resorted to alcohol - drinking himself into a stupor.It may have been his own inability to cope with certain aspects of his life which led Laing to see the mad in such a compassionate (indeed, romanticized) light.  Indeed, Laing raises for the thinking individual many questions about the nature of sanity and madness, the nature of man and normality, the roles of society on the individual, the nature of family life and myth in family life, the role of abuse on man to his fellow man, and ultimately about the very nature of reality itself as seen in the light of the eyes of the mentally ill individual.  This book offers a good biography of Laing, an anti-psychiatrist who combined insights from both religious mysticism and phenomenology and existential philosophy into a political thesis about the nature of psychosis and schizoid/schizophrenic being-in-the-world.  While I believe that the role of biological processes in mental illness is entirely underrated by individuals like Laing and Szasz, nevertheless, their books offer a unique alternative look at the medical establishment which often foists unfair measures upon those who are merely deemed different.	2004-02-16
US	50058656	R12KEQ28J0VVP0	0815604602	736160894	Insanity: The Idea and Its Consequences	Books	5	31	34	N	N	Psychiatric Enslavement:  Madmen or Mad Doctors?	In _Ideology and Insanity_ Thomas Szasz, professor of psychiatry and libertarian activist, presents a view of the dark side of the psychiatric establishment.  Szasz is known for being one of the originators of the anti-psychiatry point of view in the 1960s (along with such others as R. D. Laing) and is a noted libertarian in the school of such individuals as Karl Popper, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek.  In this book, Szasz makes the rather odd, indeed astonishing claim, that mental illness is entirely a myth and rests on a misunderstanding of the nature of illness.  Rather than viewing certain individuals as mentally ill and thus diagnosing them with particular mental disorders, Szasz argues that it is best instead to view these individuals as possessing problems in living.  Szasz contends that the diagnostic labels used to categorize mental illness are in fact nothing more than stigmatizing slurs (despite the contention by psychiatrists to the contrary, or that \\"mental illness is an illness like any other\\").  Psychiatry has a long, bloody, and inglorious history, beginning perhaps with medieval manuals on witch-hunting (e.g. the notorious _Malleus Maleficarum_) often used to eliminate dissidents and heretics, and including Nazi experimentation, the authoritarian theories of Sigmund Freud, and communist totalitarian psychiatry.  Indeed, Szasz tells the story of a certain poet who was found mentally imbalanced by a psychiatrist in the Soviet Union because \\"poetry did not constitute useful work\\" and thus held captive against his will in an asylum.  Too often psychiatry has resorted to fascist brutality and cruelty, including coercion, outright fraud, lying, forced medication, forced incarceration in a mental hospital, forced electroshock and insulin treatments, forced confinement, and even dangerous psychosurgeries such as lobotomy.  Szasz notes that much of the problem rests with the undefined role of the psychiatrist (or psychologist).  Thus, the psychiatrist(or psychologist) is faced with a continual conflict of interests, is he primarily interested in the patient (as a doctor would be) or is he interested in protection of society from dissidence and persecution of deviancy.  Too often the psychiatrist sees himself as an authoritarian figure, capable of bestowing a given label upon an individual for any reason at all (needing only to justify this with reference to the completely open ended categories of the _DSM_), and legally able to confine an individual against his will and recommend \\"treatments\\" which often amount to no more than tortures.  Szasz examines the role of the psychiatrist in the government, in law, in the public schools, and at universities, and shows how each of these roles fundamentally rests on fraud and dishonesty.  Psychiatrists (and psychologists) frequently violate so-called confidentiality in the best interests of an institution they serve (or an insurance company) for example so as to protect that institution from certain individuals declared insane.  Szasz notes that much of what the psychiatrist does consists of an attempt to shift powers from the legal and judicial systems as well as societal and social responsiblities to a group of technocratic doctor/bureaucrats.  It is this authoritarian/scientistic/collectivistic orientation of the psychiatrist that Szasz finds so alarming.  While I believe Szasz would say that psychiatrists (and psychologists) can and do generally help people, he notes that their entire profession fundamentally rests upon an attribution error, fraud, and a conflict of interests.  This is not to disparage the many good and caring individuals who enter these professions in an effort to help others.  The arguments of Szasz are radical, in that even \\"illnesses\\" such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia which are now almost entirely believed to be biologically based, are argued by him to be based on mere convention.  Frequently, by assigning these labels to individuals they are conveniently scapegoated, their rights denied them, and then they are thrown to the dogs of society and left to fend for themselves.  This is a true travesty of justice and a great shame to our society.  Szasz proposes an entirely individualist ethic which orients the psychiatrist towards the patient and which views man as autonomous and endowed with free will.  I disagree with certain points of this ethic, in that I do not believe in a right to abortion or suicide etc., however I do note that psychiatry is frequently used merely to categorize those who are not like us.  Szasz's orientation is secular and humanistic as well as atheist; however, he oddly mentions God quite a few times within his book.  Also, I note that he makes little distinction between outright behaviors (which a psychiatrist may deem deviant) and reports of inner states (thoughts, moods, and feelings) which seem to play little role in his book.  Indeed, most individuals who consult psychiatrists consult them voluntarily to help deal with thoughts or feelings which pose troublesome for them.  Even individuals which are labelled schizophrenic by the psychiatric establishment (usually who are entirely harmless) may be able to identify their troubling thoughts and feelings.  Perhaps schizophrenia merely consists in an alternative mode of perceiving the world.  It is the authoritarian psychiatrist who declares the schizophrenic to be guilty of a \\"thought crime\\" and argues that his perception of reality has no validity.  Szasz does not deny the existence of delusions, hallucinations, or illusions, but he merely questions their usefulness as determiners of \\"mental illness\\".  Thus, all three occur commonly in life, even in the lives of so-called \\"normal\\" people.  While there is much in this book that is controversial, it is sure to provide a great deal of concern for the individual living in the modern world as it increasingly comes to resemble that of 1984.	2004-01-25

However, at times the book veers off into near communistic insanity in its hatred for corporate capitalism and its insistence that all men should earn the same wage regardless of profession during wartime.  In fact, wars have often been provoked with little or no justification, often at the whims of bankers and transnational elites, and wars are often poorly conducted so as not to serve the best interests of America and the American soldier.  However, war itself is a necessary fact of life in the world of nations.  The idea that war can be totally eliminated through some international means of collaboration is not only absurd, but all the more likely to foster the world's biggest totalitarian system yet devised.  In fact, to suggest that war be eliminated is tantamount to suggesting that one tolerate the intolerable.  However, this is not really General Butler's position.  Instead, Butler argues that war itself cannot be eliminated but that the United States should not become entangled in events which are not of its concern and thus try to maintain neutrality at all costs.  For instance, if the United States were to be invaded by foreign occupiers, then of course war would become necessary.  Also, if a given nation poses a direct threat to the well being of the citizens of the U.S., then war is inevitable provided that that nation cannot be quelled through diplomacy.  However, to fight a war for purely economic interests of profit, thereby risking the lives of countless young men merely to increase the profits of corporate interests, is entirely immoral.  The real question then becomes how can one know when the interests of America are really being put first.  In recent times, many have started to question the tactics of President George W. Bush's \\"War on Terror\\" initiative and invasion of Iraq, post-9/11, on precisely the same grounds that individuals like Smedley had questioned the First and Second World Wars.  Whether America's true interests are being put first remains to be seen.  The book concludes with some ghastly photos of wartime attrocities, including pictures of young men badly disfigured (one picture shows a man with half his face missing, both upper jaw and nose being completely removed).  Such is the price of maintaining American sovereignity and imperial power.  Or, as Smedley would cynically observe, such is the price we pay for domination by corporate elites.<br />Also of interest:  _Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace_, a collection of &quot;isolationist&quot; essays edited by Harry Elmer Barnes and revealing the hidden agenda behind United States entry into World War II.

The book contains hundreds of remarks which are utterly laughable and rarely quotes original sources, choosing instead to quote from various obscure works by eccentric and rogue scholars of the nineteenth century. Where original sources do appear, the author always has them concealed as a quote in the writing of another who always happens to be another pseudo-scholar from the nineteenth century. Examples of absurdities include the idea that bigot and cretin orginally referred to Christians, thus indicating the supposed stupidity and arrogance of the early priests. However, a careful exegesis of these two words will show how absurd this assertion is. While bigot may have originated from the curse \\"By God\\" thus perhaps indicating religious fanaticism, it probably originated from the roving Begouins who were medieval groups of flagellants and entirely outside of the church proper. While cretin shares the same origin as the word Christian, a proper exegesis will show that the term was not meant as one of abuse at all. Rather, the term cretin was applied to certain mentally inadequate individuals by priests because it was said that they were at least good Christians. Thus, it is a term of respect for the poor and mentally inadequate among Christian believers and not one of disdain in its original meaning. Of course such fine shades of distinction are utterly meaningless to Acharya S who will use all she can get to attack Christianity in her blind hatred of God and His Church. Acharya S proposes an interesting theory however with regards to the origin of the Christian Gospels arguing that the Gospels in fact were concocted from Gnostic texts and that Gnosticism is the original source of the Christian myth (Christ having been a sort of fictional character). Thus, shewill argue that the Gnostic Marcion's text _The Gospel of the Lord_ is the first written Gospel which describes Christ as a kind of angelic being and not as a man and was subsequently used as a source for the _Gospel of Luke_. While I believe she does have a point about Gnosticism, the influence of which has been woefully misunderstood (cf. the works of the entirely orthodox Roman Catholic traditionalist theologian Jean Borella for a sort of gnostic retrieval in the Christian tradition) her assertions about the origins of the Gospels are something that no scholar (outside of the few eccentrics she cites to prove her point, almost entirely from the nineteenth century, many with links to the occult) either traditionalist or modernist would be able to accept. In fact, _The Gospel of Matthew_ was written first perhaps 8 or 10 years after the Lord's ascension into heaven (as traditionalists have always maintained). As the book progresses the arguments used by Acharya S become more and more absurd and it becomes clear that she has been influenced by occult, neo-gnostic, and new age myth making (much of which had its origin in the nineteenth century - although as _Ecclesiastes_ has it \\"there is nothing new under the sun\\" meaning that this sort of mythmaking is nothing more than resurrected heresy and satanism for the modern world). Acharya S frequently makes use of terms like \\"sexist\\" and \\"racist\\" etc. to describe her understanding of Christian tradition; however, as can be seen these terms are basically without meaning, both sex and race differences being entirely real, and thus properly understood as a construct of the politically correct era used with a distinctly \\"social engineering\\" type agenda in mind. One thing that does emerge from reading this book is this: Acharya S totally hates Christians and Christ and His Church and will resort to any methods available to smear them and their cause. While she claims to love pagans (a term originally meaning roughly \\"country folk\\"), in fact her methods reveal a complete and total loathing for the heritage of the European West (as well as the Christian East) in all its forms. While it is true that many of the communists were Jewish influenced (as Acharya S claims, cf. _The Rulers of Russia_ by Roman Catholic priest Father Denis Fahey) it is also true that Marx renounced Judaism proper (cf. his notorious \\"antisemitic\\" essay on the \\"Jewish Question\\") and may in fact have turned to Satanism himself (as much modern research shows after examining certain of his letters) and not atheism (which is really a sort of Jewish/materialist adaptation) as originally believed. On the other hand, there is no evidence to support the insane claims of Acharya S that either Adolf Hitler or even less so Joseph Stalin were influenced in any manner by traditional Christianity (either Roman or Eastern Catholicism). In fact, both fascism and communism have roots much closer to the occult, freemasonry, and the ancient revival of Gnostic heresy. I have not finished this book yet, being only about halfway through, but from the look of things, it appears that Acharya S delves deeper and deeper into occult insanity, eventually concluding (accurately, ironically) that an ancient global culture existed from which originated modern religions. Of course, she fails to mention that the same Christian God has been watching history from its onset preparing the way for His incarnation in Jesus Christ and eventual Second Coming. It is clear to me however, that Acharya S has one goal in mind complete degradation of Christian holiness and Our humble Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who was brutally crucified upon a Cross for proclaiming his Godmanhood. It is clear that her interests are not those of truth and light and love and joy but rather those of hate and rancor and deceitfulness, just as her own father, the prince of this world, a fallen archangel cast out of heaven for pride before God has taught her.	2004-01-14

In addition to basing his theological reflections on Scripture, the Church fathers, and the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, Jean Borella has also been heavily influenced by Cardinal Henri de Lubac's view of the \\"Surnaturel\\" as well as the writings of the traditionalist school founded by Rene Guenon and further developed by Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon.  One of Borella's major contributions in this book especially is to revive the idea of an authentic Christian gnosis (as opposed to the false gnosis of the early Gnostic heretics condemned for example by Saint Irenaeus in _Against the Heresies_).  Gnosis itself is scriptural in origin, the word being used by Saint Paul to refer to true faith, but also used as a term of denunciation to refer to \\"pseudoscience\\" or \\"false knowledge\\" which proliferated among early Gnostic heretics and was also denounced by Saint Irenaeus.  In this respect, the role of Mary, the Theotokos, in the church and Christ (God made flesh)as the Immaculate Conception, thereof, plays an important part in an understanding of true gnosis.  Borella notes that Gnosticism is opposed by both sides from the \\"Right and the Left\\", meaning that both forces of tradition and of progress have been known to condemn Gnosticism.  However, here Borella has attempted to revive the authentic form of gnosis which is simply faith as opposed to the \\"pseudoscience\\" of false Gnosticism.  This book contains many reflections on different topics concerning the \\"Christian way\\" as well as the role of Christ as Savior and Redeemer of mankind.  Borella's writings are influenced especially by the neoPlatonism and ultra-realism of Saint Bonaventure whose verses serve as introductions to each separate section and also by the mysticism of Meister Eckhart as well as the reflections of Origen on the &quot;apocastasis&quot; (the final redemption of all souls in God - Borella notes that what burns in hell indeed is the fire of Divine Love).  The book is divided into seven \\"stages\\", each made to symbolize a form of ascent.  These include \\"Contemplating God through His Vestiges in the Universe\\" (which consists chiefly of reflections on the Trinity), \\"Contemplating God in His Vestiges in the Sense World\\" (which consists of an interpretation of science and cosmology in the light of Nicholas of Cusa but also reflections on modern Newtonian and subsequent science, as well as an explanation of symbolism), \\"Contemplating God through His Image Stamped upon Our Natural Powers\\" (which consists of an explanation of man and his divinity in Christ in the New Testament), \\"Contemplating God in His Image Reformed by the Gifts of Grace\\" (which consists of reflections on love and gnosis in the Creator as well as reflections on the opening of the human heart in the Old Testament, the Kabbalah and Jewish tradition), \\"Contemplating the Divine Unity through its Primary Name which Is Being\\" (which consists of reflections on love of Self and God), \\"Contemplating the Most Blessed Trinity in its Name Which is Good\\" (which consists of reflections on the Holy Trinity and the divine hypostases), and finally \\"The Sabbath of Rest and Ecstasy\\" (which consists of reflections on the Body of Christ and the metaphysics of eternal exposition).  Borella's reflections include detailed remarks about the errors in the postmodern philosophy of such thinkers as Jacques Derrida as well as mention of modern science and comparison of it to tradition.  Borella also frequently mentions other religious traditions including the Vedanta of India and the Sufi mysticism of Islam and compares these forms of mysticism with authentic Christian mysticism.  Borella makes some interesting remarks about early Christianity and some of the early accusations against the Christians (that of worshipping an ass-headed God crucified as well as cannibalism and the drinking of blood) and relates these to the Egyptian deity Set and shows how this in fact represents a satanic inversion of true Christianity (Set being a representation of Satan).  Borella also mentions the mythical lost continent of Atlantis first described by Plato in his _Critias_ and _Timaeus_ and later revived by subsequent esotericists.  In addition, Borella reflects on the &quot;Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil&quot; within the context of Genesis in the Garden of Eden and relates this to the Cross in which Christ is crucified between two thieves (one good, the other evil).  This shows some of the occult influence of thinkers such as Rene Guenon on the theology of Borella.  However, despite his inclinations towards various obscure points of view as well as esoteric initiation, Jean Borella remains thoroughly orthodox and truly loyal to Christianity in the form of Roman Catholicism.  His theology attempts to integrate a proper understanding of gnosis into Roman Catholic theology based on a revival of certain early Church fathers and Scripture.  In this respect he has been praised by other noted Roman Catholic theologians such as Hans urs van Balthassar.  Borella remains ambivalent towards certain documents of the Second Vatican Council which have posed such a problem to many of those loyal Catholics who wish to maintain a traditionalist outlook.  In this sense, Borella represents a revival of tradition within the Church.  This volume is translated from the French by G. John Champoux and offers a unique and beautiful extension of the writings of the traditionalist school (founded by Rene Guenon) and an integration of gnosis into Roman Catholic theological thought.s cannibalism and the drinking of blood) and relates these to the Egyptian deity Set and shows how this in fact represents a satanic inversion of true Christianity (Set being a representation of Satan).

Liberty, Not the Daughter, but the Mother of Order.  - Proudhon.<br />Republished in the series \\"The Right Wing Individualist Tradition in America\\", _Instead of a Book_ is a collection of excerpts chiefly from the journal _Liberty_ published by Benjamin Tucker, as well as a single essay entitled \\"State Socialism and Anarchism\\", which are put together so as to outline Tucker's anarchist philosophy.  Benjamin Tucker (a graduate of M.I.T.) published the journal _Liberty_ in Boston and he developed his ideas from other great anarchists such as Proudhon (whose essay \\"What is Property?\\" served as inspiration for anarchism), Jossiah Warren (an important American anarchist), Bakunin (the famous Russian anarchist), Max Stirner (Left Hegelian philosopher and writer of the radical egoist individualist anarchist tract _The Ego and Its Own_), Lyssander Spooner (another great American libertarian) and to a lesser extent individuals such as Kropotkin (although Tucker shows how Kropotkin is not a true anarchist) and Herbert Spencer.  The philosophy of anarchism amounts to an affirmation of the individual and a denial of all authority (especially the authority of the state, but also the authority of religion and capital) and seeks to maximize individual liberty.  The anarchist believes that all is permitted provided that it does not involve infringement upon the liberty of another, and thus the anarchist is opposed to all state interference, whether this be through taxation, state supported monopoly, state seizure of property, Prohibition laws, and in America slavery, etc.  The anarchist does not believe in human rights, but rather maintains the principle of \\"equality of liberty\\" - maximizing individual liberty provided it does not involve invasion.  Anarchy differs from what Tucker calls \\"state socialism\\" (a philosophy whose chief proponent is Karl Marx) in that it does not call for government management of the affairs of men, advocates individual liberty, is not authoritarian (theopposite in fact), and maintains that by abolishing the state, capitalistic monopoly will disappear.  In this sense, anarchy rejects all authority and monopoly (including the monopoly of the state to print money, and the monopoly of the usurer, as well as the monopoly on ideas), and although opposed to what Tucker calls \\"state socialism\\", Tucker still maintains that anarchy is a \\"socialism\\" preferring to rehabilitate this word for his use.  Sections in this book deal with \\"The Individual, Society, and the State\\" (in which the opposition of anarchism to what was inaccurately called \\"individualism\\" is emphasized), \\"Money and Interest\\" (in which the anarchist opposition to usury and state monopoly is explained), \\"Land and Rent\\" (in which the anarchist opposition to rent on land is explained), \\"Socialism\\" (in which Tucker again maintains that anarchy is a \\"socialism\\" but opposes this to the authoritarian \\"state socialism\\" of Karl Marx), \\"Communism\\" (in which Tucker argues that communism is authoritarian and opposed to anarchism), \\"Methods\\" (in which Tucker distinguishes between his anarchism and that of other \\"state socialistic anarchists\\" who advocate violence against capital, such as was seen at the Chicago bombings), and a \\"Miscellaneous\\" section (in which Tucker praises certain important precursors and notes again the battle between labor and capital).  Many important and unique contributions to political thought can be found within this book (excerpted almost entirely from the pages of _Liberty_).  In sum, this book presents an excellent introduction to anarchist thought by a great American libertarian, Benjamin Tucker.	2003-11-30
US	50058656	R22ZMXBCRMCTB6	0060133643	770404721	Race And Race History And Other Essays By Alfred Rosenberg (Roots Of The Right: Readings In Fascist, Racist And Elitist Ideology)	Books	5	23	28	N	N	Alfred Rosenberg - Racist Philosopher of the Third Reich.	This book in the series Roots of the Right:  Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology is a collection of essays and excerpts from the writings of Nazi theorist and philosopher Alfred Rosenberg.  Rosenberg, who was born in 1893 in the Baltic town of Reval and later moved to Moscow, was one of the principal racist philosophers behind the Third Reich.  Most of the essays included in this book are from Rosenbergs principal work _Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts_ (_The Myth of the Twentieth Century_) (1930), but other works of Rosenberg are mentioned.  Rosenbergs thought is based entirely on racial theories of Aryan (Nordic, Germanic) superiority, including the works of earlier racist theorists such as Count de Gobineau, Gougenot des Mousseaux, and especially Houston Stewart Chamberlain who praised the Germans in his racialist work _Die Grundlagen des XIX Jahrhunderts_ (_The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century) (1895), as well as a convoluted construction of German Romanticism and the Nietzschean ideal of the superman.  Rosenberg opposed Christianity and in particular was virulently anti-Catholic, rejecting the Old Testament entirely and regarding Jesus Christ as not of Jewish blood, he also opposed Saint Paul as a \\"semitic influence\\" on early Christianity.  The first essay presented in this book is entitled Race and Race History and offers a racialist interpretation of history as the struggle between the Aryan (Nordic) race and various distorters (especially the Jews) as played out in the cultures of ancient Egypt, India, Persia, Greece, Rome, and medieval Germany to the time of Rosenbergs writing.  Rosenberg frequently blames Jewish influence for distortions in his cultural ideal as well as for Roman Catholicism (Christianity) which he particularly loathes, as well as making reference to Greek, Nordic, and Indian (Aryan) mythologies.  The second essay presented in this book is entitled Nordic Religion and offers Rosenbergs religious interpretations for Germanic man, rejecting the influences of the Jews and Roman Catholicism and praising Nordic mythology.  Rosenberg has high regard for Luther (who became an anti-Semite) though he rejects Lutheranism which retained the Old Testament, and particularly for Meister Eckhart, the Germanic mystic and Dominican monk, who he regards as a key component in a true Nordic religion.  Rosenberg rejects the Jewish Father-God (Jahweh) and instead seems to believe in a sort of pantheism and all-embracing unitarianism (as seen in the philosophies of India), perhaps combining Gnosticism with ancient Norse paganism (belief in the ancient deities Wotan, Thor, Loki, and the Fenris Wolf legend).  The third essay in this book is entitled Kultur:  The Volkish Aesthetic.  This essay praises what Rosenberg regards as genuine manifestations of Germanic Volkish aesthetic found in the ancient Greeks (though he rejects Socrates, echoing Nietzsche, perhaps), in Beethoven and Richard Wagner, in Friedrich Nietzsche, and in Schiller and Goethe, as well as other Germanic artists.  Rosenberg has praise for the Middle Ages and Germanic culture and contrasts this to Jewish distortion, modern art developments, and artistic Bolshevism which he finds particularly prevelant in such artists as Van Gogh and Picasso.  For the racist Rosenberg, all great artistic achievements can be attributed to (Germanic) Volkish art.  The fourth essay included in this book is entitled The Enemy and deals principally with the Jews.  Rosenberg quotes from the Talmud arguing that the Jews are ruthless in business and prefer the activities of the merchant to those of farming, while maintaining a double standard with regard to non-Jews and engaging in usury.  Here, Rosenberg echoes many of the common anti-Semitic beliefs which existed at the time of the Third Reich.  The final essay included in this book is The Ideal State.  Here, Rosenberg argues against the Hegelian ideal of the total state as well as showing some affinity for the Romantic version of medieval society and the Baltic and Nordic states and propagates his National Socialist views.  The book includes an introduction by Professor Robert Pois, showing the dangers of Rosenbergs philosophy as well as a useful bibliography.  After the defeat of Hitler, Rosenberg was found guilty by the Nuremberg Tribunal and subsequently hanged.  This reprint of some of Rosenbergs writings is important because it allows the modern reader to look into the mind of a Third Reich theorist, whose dangerous philosophy was played out in the disaster that followed.	2003-11-22

The book _Nietzsche:  Godfather of Fascism?_ consists of a series of essays by various scholars and philosophers dealing with the question of the relationship between Nietzsche's philosophy and Nazism and Fascism as well as anti-Semitism.  Friedrich Nietzsche, who has been described as a \\"radical aristocrat\\" and \\"the last anti-political German\\", a precursor of nihilism, remains a problematic and enigmatic (if not contradictory) thinker to this day.  Nietzsche espoused contempt for \\"herd values\\" and \\"slave morality\\" and such political developments as democracy, liberalism, egalitarianism, and socialism, as well as for Christianity and the morality it espoused and Judaism.  However, at the same time, he also expressed contempt for anti-Semitism, Richard Wagner (who he was initially a disciple of) and his followers, German nationalism, the German Reich, and Germans.  Nietzsche praised German Jews (possibly regarding them as a catalyst for his imperialist aspirations of European renewal, and as a precursor to the Ubermensch, in one interpretation of his writings), had Jewish friends including Paul Ree (who may have influenced his decision to separate himself from Wagner and anti-Semitism in general), and expressed Francophile sentiments as well.  On the the other hand, in many of his letters Nietzsche did express contempt for both Judaism and Christianity (although he praised the Old Testament), individual Jews, and may have believed in certain racist theories to an extent which were popular at the time (indeed, he frequently referenced the codification of the Aryan caste system in _The Laws of Manu_ as an ideal, and praised the Greeks and Romans as well as ancient slavery).  In light of this, an assessment of Nietzsche in terms of his relationship to fascism (and national socialism) or his role as a possible proto-fascist has proven difficult for scholars and opinions vary widely.  Added to this difficulty is the issue of Nietzsche's madness (rumored to have been brought on by syphillis, although probably without basis in fact) at the end of his life, and the subsequent role of his sister Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche in the preparation of his manuscripts.  Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche was married to a notorious anti-Semite and later would come to support the Nazis and Hitler, although she herself was not anti-Semitic (oddly enough).  In addition, Nietzsche's philosophy was expropriated by certain Nazi philosophers including Alfred Baumler, Heinrich Hartle, and of course Martin Heidegger and Alfred Rosenberg who managed to smooth over his anti-anti-Semitism and anti-Germanism; although, other Nazi theorists argued that Nietzsche was an anti-Nazi and thus contrary to their movement.  Hitler (although likely to have never read Nietzsche, at least not extensively) frequently mentioned Nietzschian motifs in his writings, speechs, and talks, and did pay homage to Nietzsche by visiting his sister at the Nietzsche Archives.  Mussolini and the Italian fascist d'Annunzio were ardent Nietzschians on the other hand, both having read his works, and frequently quoting from him (especially the dictum \\"live dangerously\\"), and using his ideas in their political movement.  On the other hand, philosophers such as Georges Bataille, Karl Jaspers, and for Amerians particularly Walter Kaufmann have argued that Nietzsche would have disdained National Socialism (Kaufmann in particular presenting a very sanitized portrayal of Nietzsche, and placing much of the blame for his \\"misinterpretation\\" upon N.'s sister).  Thus, the relationship of Nietzsche to fascism remains problematic.  Indeed, many have tried to pigeon-hole Nietzsche relating his essentially anti-political philosophy to anarchism, aristocratic conservativism, or fascism.  Orthodox Marxists reject Nietzsche arguing that he is indeed a precursor to fascism; while leftist postmodern academics have praised him and his project of \\"revaluation of values\\".  Essays in this book deal with Nietzsche's responsibility (whatever it may be) for Nazism, Nietzsche and Hitler, Nietzsche and the Jews, Nietzsche and Wagner, Nietzsche's anti-Christian atheism and anti-Judaism, Nietzsche's imperialism (his call for a restoration of Europe along classical Greek and Roman lines), the relationship between Nietzsche and the poet Holderlin (both succumbing to madness and both praised by the Third Reich), an interesting essay arguing that Nietzsche's sister should not be scapegoated for his misappropriation by fascists (contrary to the thinking that clouds much of the extant writing on Nietzsche in American circles), an essay on Nietzsche and Mussolini emphasizing the Italian fascist poet d'Annunzio and his relationship to Nietzsche's thought, an essay on Ernst Junger and his relationship to Nietzsche (emphasizing the role of \\"reactionary modernism\\" in the conservative revolutionary thinkers which existed in Germany prior to the rise of Hitler including the philosopher Martin Heidegger), and an essay by a leftist postmodern academic arguing against an otherwise interesting thesis by conservative thinker Ernst Nolte.  These essays compose a good collection of material relating to Nietzsche, his successors, and his relationship to fascism and national socialism in their various guises. <br />Also recommended:  _Heidegger's Crisis_ by Hans Sluga.	2003-11-22
US	50058656	R18HJIPPP357LR	0805058710	766674368	A Nation on Trial: The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth	Books	5	38	51	N	N	The "Goldhagen Thesis" Refuted.	Among the academically politically correct, a particularly noxious notion has been revised in the work of Daniel Goldhagen in his book _Hitler's Willing Executioners_.  This is the racist idea of the \\"barbaric Hun\\", popular among the British and Allied forces in the \\"Great War\\".  Like such precursors as Theodor Kaufman, writer of the notorious tract _Germany Must Perish!_, Goldhagen has revised the idea that the entire German nation was to blame for Hitler, all Germans being possessed of a crazed anti-Semitism.  According to Goldhagen, it is the ordinary Germans who were the most bestial in their brutality towards the Jews (and of course Goldhagen focuses conveniently only on the Jews, arguing that the Holocaust of the Jews was a unique historical event without precedent, indeed outside of time).  But, then according to Goldhagen, this mass madness was magically to disappear with the end of the war and the defeat of Hitler; indeed, the modern Germans are the very champions of liberty courtesy of the reconstitution of their nation with the help of the Allied forces.  Fortunately, many of those who are not blinded by political correctness can see through the absurdity of this farce presented as historical thesis.  In this book, two essays are presented which attempt to refute Goldhagen's thesis.  The first is by Norman Finkelstein, himself a Jew and descended from survivors of the Holocaust.  The second is by Ruth Bittina Birn, another expert on the historical tragedy which subsisted in the Third Reich.  Both essays attempt to show through actually examining the historical record the house of cards which the Goldhagen thesis proves to be.  Upon closer examination it becomes apparent that many of the German officers were not possessed by madness but indeed looked upon their activities as part of a disgusting, albeit necessary, part of the war bureaucracy.  In addition, like most who focus on the Holocaust, the role of other social groups persecuted by Hitler and laterby the communists who were to seize control of half of Germany after the war is totally ignored by Goldhagen.  Finkelstein brings out some interesting points in comparing various historical tragedies including many which exist in modern America and within the modern world with those that occurred during World War II.  Indeed, so much has been made of the horrendous events which occurred during this war that it has become difficult to discern the truth, from the haze.  Goldhagen represents an unfortunate turn in revisionist scholarship, attempting to swamp the American public with yet more horrendous tales of Holocaust attrocities.  Yet, while this occurs the attrocities of the communists (particularly under Stalin, far greater than those of Hitler and his regime) are entirely ignored by academic scholarship (if not outright denied).  Why is this?  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the kind of rabid political correctness that exists among the revisionist left which holds such sway in academia.  While both Norman Finkelstein and Ruth Bittina Birn are both leftists of a different sort, their essays do make some valuable points about the need for historical truth.  Unfortunately, they both seem to be under the spell that Hitler's Reich was a \\"right wing regime\\", even though such a regime did contain many leftist/collectivist elements.  This is unfortunate; however, it remains a minor criticism in an otherwise well written refutation.	2003-11-15

This book is also meant to serve as an explication for the events which took place during the Second Vatican Council regarding the position of the church on the Jews and Judaism.  According to de Poncins certain powerful Jewish forces (backed by organizations such as the freemasonic B'nai B'rith) were able to infiltrate the thinking of Vatican prelates and Roman Catholic bishops to force a church decision on the \\"Jewish question\\" and to re-configure traditional Christian teaching.  It is well known that the Gospel accounts of the Passion of Christ (in particular the Gospel of Matthew) do not show favorably for the principal Jewish leaders at the time.  Indeed, the Roman official Pontius Pilate was said to have not wanted to murder Christ and later to have washed his hands, symbolically cleansing himself of the murder, while the crowd demanded that Christ be crucified.  Upon crucifying Christ, the crowd cried out \\"His blood be on us and all our children\\" (which some interpreted to mean a curse upon the Jewish nation - regarded by certain fanatics as \\"the deicide people\\").  In addition, certain church fathers including especially Saint John Chrysostom, Saint Augustine, and Saint Pope Gregory the Great were known to teach the doctrine that the Jews served as a \\"witness people\\" given their failure to convert and recognize the Messiah.  Many Jewish scholars including Jules Isaac (whose writings de Poncins examines) have questioned the historical validity of the Gospel accounts, arguing for the exoneration of the Jewish leaders at the time of Christ (as well as the condemnation of the Romans).  Jules Isaac in particular, challenges nearly 2000 years of Christian teaching by calling into question many of the familiar Christian formulas and blaming Christians for anti-Semitism among Europeans.  Indeed, individuals such as Jules Isaac may have helped to sway the minds of the Catholic bishops (such as Cardinal Bea who led a progressive faction in pushing for the church statement on the Jews and Judaism).  Conservative forces within the church as well as those among the Arab states (including many Arab Christians) argued against this measure and were able to get the official statement amended so as not to mention the \\"deicide\\" charge specifically.  De Poncins attempts to demonstrate how the church's position has changed with regard to the Jews as well as how anti-Semitism has arisen among the European nations.  Indeed, it was during the modern era when both the dictators Hitler and Stalin sought radical solutions to \\"the Jewish Question\\" involving mass murder.  However, according to de Poncins, this must be considered within its historical context and within the context of Jewish-Gentile relations.  In modern times, an entirely new issue has arisen, that of the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church and in particular the pope, Pius XII, with the Nazi and Fascist regimes.  Certain Jewish writers especially have called into question the activities of Pius XII during this time.  However, by bringing up dead issues and besieging the American people with an endless series of books detailing Christian involvement in the Holocaust, the Jews have been able to further their own control within government.  Indeed, many Catholic writers and de Poncins himself have written exonerating the Roman Pontiff of all wrongdoing.  Thus, Jewish and Roman Catholic relations remain strained.  Despite the attempted patch-up job done at the Second Vatican Council, it can be argued that Judaism and Christianity remain fundamentally irreconcilable in a way that Christianity and other religions (e.g. Islam) do not.	2003-11-15

Written by former Transcendentalist turned Roman Catholic conservative, Orestes Brownson, _The American Republic_ is an inquiry into the nature of government, the formation of the Constitution, and the relationship between federal and states' rights in America right after the Civil War period.  Orestes Brownson notes that he writes his book for all Americans but in particular for those who are Roman Catholic so as to understand their nation and its Constitution.  As a Roman Catholic, Orestes Brownson bases much of his argument upon the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Suarez, Pierre Leroux, and Abbate Gioberti, the majority of whom were also Catholic Christians.  The first section of this book deals with the origins and nature of government.  Orestes Brownson notes that a proper understanding of government is possible only by recognizing that man is a creature endowed with certain characteristics, but dependent upon his Creator.  Next, he considers eight different theories which are offered as explanations of the origin of government and the principle of sovereignity.  These theories are listed as:<BR>&quot;I. Government originates in the right of the father to govern his child.<BR>II. It originates in convention, and is a social compact.<BR>III. It originates in the people, who, collectively taken, are sovereign.<BR>IV. Government springs from the spontaneous development of nature.<BR>V. It derives its right from the immediate and express appointment of God; -<BR>VI. From God through the Pope, or visible head of the spiritual society; -<BR>VII. From God through the people; -<BR>VIII. From God through the natural law.&quot;<BR>Orestes Brownson considers each of these theories in turn and shows how they are each problematic.  In a subsequent section, Brownson considers the Constitution of government.  Here he references the work of Traditionalist French Catholic, Count Joseph de Maistre, who wrote on the generation of constitutionsand was a reactionary opponent of the French Revolution.  Brownson argues against those revolutionaries who believe that constitution is determined by a social contract which is agreed upon as savages become civilized (such as the theory advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau).  Brownson considers the sovereignity of kings and the Roman emperors and shows how they differ from the Constitution in America.  Next Brownson turns his attention to the United States and its Constitution.  In particular, Brownson examines the issue of Confederacy versus Union that was played out in the debate between federalist and anti-federalist and saw its realization in _The Constitution_ which superseded _The Articles of Confederation_.  Indeed, it is the issue of states' rights which was to play such a large part in the subsequent Civil War between the Southern and Northern States.  Brownson considers the issue of secession and shows how those in the Southern states believed themselves to belong to a Confederacy and thus believed that their states had the right to secede.  Alternatively, those in the Northern states including then President Abraham Lincoln argued that the union must be preserved at all costs.  Brownson shows how this preservation of the union occurred even at the risk of defying certain parts of the Constitution, at the same time as it was argued that it must be preserved.  Brownson shows that since the member of the Confederacy of Southern States believed himself to belong to a confederacy and thus believed that his state had a right to secede from a confederacy to which it belonged he was not a traitor or a revolutionary since he acted within his beliefs. Brownson considers the reconstruction of the South and shows how the Civil War involved a conflict between different notions of democracy.  The South represented an individualist (Jeffersonian) notion of democracy, as opposed to a territorial democracy or the socialistic democracy of those who wanted to preserve the union.  The war was not fought over the issue of slavery contrary to what may have been believed in Europe at the time by those who advocated against slavery.  Finally, Brownson turns his attention to the political destiny of the country.  As a Roman Catholic, Brownson argues that religion must play an important role in the reshaping of the nation.  After the Civil War, the entire nation emerged as a united people, and it is necessary for the Northern States to offer peace with those who they fought against in the South.  Brownson remarks that the Catholic church is not to be united with the state, nor is the church to be subsumed under the state, but rather both must be allowed to freely exist.  These remarks by Brownson are important for understanding his position and the position of the church regarding earthly sovereigns.  This essay is an important contribution to political thought from a Roman Catholic perspective regarding the nation in America which had just undergone the turbulent struggle of the Civil War.  In addition, this essay is important because it focuses upon an issue which was to continue to play such a large role in national politics, that of the rights of states.  Much of the modern political debate can be understood in terms of this single issue.	2003-10-27
US	50058656	R1HLRLSM5W8P8C	0895554623	208260469	The Crisis Of Civilization	Books	5	20	22	N	Y	The Crisis of Civilization.	_The Crisis of Civilization_ consists of lectures delivered by Catholic intellectual and historian, Hilaire Belloc, at Fordham University in 1937.  The book is radical in that it advocates Belloc's unique economic system which he was to christen \\"distributivism\\" in his book _The Servile State_ which amounts to a return to the medieval guild system, as well as a curtailment of capitalism, monopoly, and usury, a restoration of property, and a return of Europe to the Roman Catholic Faith.  For Belloc, the Faith (by this he always means the faith of Roman Catholicism) was central to the development of Western civilization, and with the Reformation and the splitting of Christendom a great loss occurred for Western civilization.  The first chapter of this book deals with \\"The Foundation of Christendom\\" and shows how Christianity spread throughout Europe by operating through corporate cells (much as the communist revolutionaries operate), which consisted of Ekklesia - the familiar hierarchy of deacon, priest, and bishop, all united under the Western Patriarch, the heir to Saint Peter, the Pope.  According to Belloc, it was Christianity which made possible the rise of the pagan slave to the level of serfdom, which involved ownership of property while living on the manor of a lord.  With the collapse of the Roman empire, the medieval society was born, and it was this society which involved widespread ownership of the means of production, privately owned.  However, a crisis occurred in medieval society brought about by heresy and a rising anti-clerical tide which resulted in the questioning of hierarchy and authority, the denial of the validity of the Roman mass, and eventually the Reformation.  One heresy that was initially destructive for Christendom was that of the religion of Mohammed, which Europeans did battle against during the Crusades.   For Belloc, Calvinism (or in its Catholic form Jansenism, or Gallicanism) was particulary destructive because of its doctrine of predestination.  Predestination caused men to look for the Elect among the successful and thus was born a mindset which involved striving to obtain money and wealth in this life as opposed to focussing on the afterlife and the world beyond.  This striving for wealth gave birth to competition and with the Industrial Revolution was completed the system of capitalism (based upon competition) which Belloc finds so noxious.  Belloc also remarks that it was at this time that traditional emphasis on \\"status\\" was replaced by emphasis upon \\"contract\\".  This emphasis upon contract made it difficult for the proletariat to obtain the benefits of production, reducing them to the level of \\"wage slaves\\".  In addition, the lending at excessive interest or usury became commonplace in Europe.  Nearly all religions have condemned usury, including of course Islam and Roman Catholicism, however when usury was allowed to proliferate the bonds holding society together began to weaken.  Belloc unequivocally condemns the usurer keeping to the original teachings of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.  Monopoly capitalism gave birth to an entirely new system of oppression, and in opposition to this was developed the ideology of communism (which denied tradition, religion, the existence of God, and the tradition of private ownership of property).  Communism was presented as a panacea for the evils of monopoly capitalism; however, as Belloc believes it is a truly wicked doctrine attempting to rise up against tradition and overthrow society.  Belloc also shows how materialism began to flourish through the doctrines of both Karl Marx and Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century.  Instead of the communistic solution, Belloc offers a unique alternative to restore widespread ownership of property as well as to curtail the evils of monopoly and usury.  Belloc writes, \\"First, the better distribution of property; secondly, the public control of monopolies; thirdly, the re-establishment of those principles and that organization which underlay the conception of the guild.\\"  Indeed, the widespread ownership of property and the means of production is for Belloc to be made possible by the establishment of a guild system (based on the medieval guild system) which will curtail the effects of monopolies from buying out the small business owner.  Of course, such a system will only be made possible with the return of Europe to the Faith.  Belloc ends the book with a discussion of the need for a Roman Catholic presentation of history, against the many Protestant and anti-Catholic historians (for example, Gibbon and Mommsen).  He also notes the need for a Roman Catholic newsletter and system of education.  The system presented here by Belloc is consistent with the teaching of the Roman Pontiffs.  In particular, the encyclical _Rerum Novarum_ issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 calls for a society which would look much the same as that advocated by Belloc along with a corporativist state.  The traditional teachings of the church and of such scholastics as Saint Thomas Aquinas on the free market and the \\"just wage theory\\" as well as the condemnation of communism by the papacy also play an important role in the thinking of Belloc.	2003-10-26

This book republished by Kessinger Publishing consists of two essays:  one focussing upon the apocryphal Gospel According to Peter and the other upon the Revelation of Peter, as well as including the original text of the fragments of both the Gospel and Revelation of Peter in Greek.  The first essay is written by J. Armitage Robinson, and it focuses upon the Gospel of Peter which was discovered in fragment.  This essay examines the early Christian fathers for mention of this Gospel and then gives an explication of the events described in this Gospel including the Passion of Christ and relates this to the four canonical Gospels.  The second essay is written by Montague Rhodes James, and it focuses upon the Revelation of Peter which was also discovered only in fragment.  The Revelation of Peter consists of images of paradise as well as ghastly descriptions of the souls suffering positive torments in Hell, a sort of precursor to _The Inferno_ of Dante.  This essay deals with the relationship between the Revelation of Peter and the early Christian community, including references to the history of Eusebius.  The Revelation of Peter was included among the canonical works in the Muratorian fragment, but it was noted that this book was found unsuitable by some for reading at the mass (perhaps this was because it contained such a vivid portrayal of the souls suffering in Hell).  The essay examines the Revelation of Peter by comparing it to certain other extant documents including the Sibylline Oracle and the canonical Apocalypse of John.  The book concludes with copies of the fragments of the Gospel of Peter and the Revelation of Peter in Greek.	2003-10-26

In this book Lawrence Dennis predicts the coming war in which America was to be immersed and shows why fighting this war will ultimately be not in the best interests of the American people.  World War II was sold to the American people on the grounds that it would \\"make the world safe from fascism\\" - in which the United States fought against Germany, Italy, and Japan - but as Lawrence Dennis shows by instituting an Industrial Mobilization Plan as well as the New Deal legislation, FDR in effect was able to bring about the fascist revolution here in America.  Lawrence Dennis sees in fascism (and national socialism, of course) as well as in the communism of Stalin the revolution and the birth of socialism.  According to Dennis, capitalism and democracy were brought about by revolution (the Industrial Revolution) and once this revolution has taken effect the subsequent socialist revolution (resulting in \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" as predicted by Karl Marx) is inevitable.  Dennis argues that Hitler had been able to bring about the revolution in Germany by capturing the capitalists through anti-communism, the nationalists through anti-Versailles rhetoric, and the masses through the anti-Semitic delusion.  (Indeed according to Karl Marx, anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools.)  Rather than preserving capitalism as the bourgeois in Germany had hoped, Hitler in fact had destroyed it and brought about socialism and thus the revolution.  Dennis notes how the existence of usury through finance capitalism makes possible interventionist involvement overseas, by the Americans.  By issuing fiat money the capitalists force industry to increase production and that this excess must be sent overseas.  In times of peace, this is easy enough to do through foreign aid.  However,eventually it becomes necessary to do so through war.  This is indeed what the elite have intended.  Dennis writes this book for the elite and not the masses, having naturally little faith in the mass man or in democracy itself.  For the in-elite, the contents of this book are already known and are being used to bring the country into a war.  But for the out-elite, this knowledge may prove valuable in their attempt to remain afloat during the subsequent revolution (brought about through the war).  Dennis seems to have sympathy for socialism as opposed to liberalism (capitalism plus democracy), although his remarks are largely intended to be merely prophetic and factual without actually taking a side on the whole issue of morality.  To Dennis, the current capitalist system fueled through finance capitalism is not in the best interests of the people of the United States and thus will be toppled.  Dennis argues that a new \\"folk unity\\" among the American people will be made necessary through the subsequent war and the coming revolution in America.  <br />Lawrence Dennis was an early writer who saw the development of socialism within America subsequent to the Second World War.  At the time, his comments were greeted with much disapproval from the elite (including FDR and his minions) and he was subsequently tried for sedition.  While Dennis wrote in the interests of America, he noted that while he personally was opposed to the coming war, he would do what was in his power to defend America after the war had started (either through propaganda writing or otherwise).  This book is one that bypasses the usual Left/Right divide and takes a look at the capitalist situation from a third perspective.  Republished by Noontide Press, this book promises to open some eyes to the immorality of the capitalist system which fuels revolution within the United States and across the world.  In an era in which a war has been declared on \\"terror\\" these writings by Lawrence Dennis are all the more important today.	2003-10-26

Engleman is a book dealing with the End Times from the perspective of an Orthodox Christian.  Basing his study on traditional prophetic writings of the Church Fathers as well as from Sacred Scripture, in particular the writings of the prophets and the Books of Daniel and Revelation, Engleman shows how modern events bear out the prescriptions described in prophecy and explains the End of Days in terms understandable to the Orthodox Christian.  Engleman focuses on the \\"Last Christians\\", those Christians who will be living during the End Times.  During the End Times the church will dwindle in size because of mass apostasy and the Christians will be identified in the catacombs, tiny islands bearing the traditional marks of oneness, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity or Christ's true church.  Engleman considers the Tsars to have been true Christian rulers, and interprets the Last Tsar, Tsar Nicholas II, as \\"the one who restrains the mystery of lawlessness\\" from 2 Thessalonians.  For Engleman and for Orthodox Christians, Moscow represents the \\"Third Rome\\", and the rise of the communist tyranny in Russia is an extremely troublesome event heralding the imminent apocalypse, in which the armies of \\"Gog and Magog\\" shall do battle.  With the fall of communism in Russia during the 1990s the possibility of a New World Order has been put forth, and such a thing promises to achieve the Kingdom of Antichrist upon the Earth.  The return of the Jews to Israel, the Holy Land, is a second event with deep historic and apocalyptic consequences.  While the Jews have rejected Christ (the Pharisees calling for his crucifixion before Pilate), it is written that in the last days they will be converted.  Currently Satan is held in bondage, but he will be released to wreak havoc upon the Earth.  Engleman also discusses modern day decadence, moral depravity, and nihilistic despair which serve as signs of the coming apocalyptic developments.  Population controlmethods (in particular the ready availability of abortion) as well as \\"New Age\\" spiritualities put forward by the United Nations (\\"the one world government\\") are paving the way for the coming of Antichrist.  The Antichrist is likely to be a great unifier and problem solver, who will unite the world under his reign; however, he will also be a great deceiver who will deceive even many Christians.  Engleman explains how Christians will not be \\"raptured\\" off the planet before the coming Tribulation and the Reign of Antichrist contrary to many of the false beliefs which currently exist within mass culture.  In the light of Holy Tradition, the \\"Rapture\\" is shown for what it truly is, a demonic deception which will lead the true believers astray during the time of Antichrist.  The Antichrist is likely to enslave many as foretold in Revelation, and many will be made to bear his mark, \\"the mark of the beast\\", upon their forehead or hand.  This is to prevent the Christian from making the Sign of the Cross, which can be used to ward off evil and will be particulary pugnacious to the Antichrist.   Two prophets will appear, Enoch and Elias, who will be martyred by the Antichrist.  Finally, there will be a great battle at Armaggedon and Christ will come again in the Parousia, the Second Coming, to judge living and the dead.  Only those Christians who \\"perservere till the end\\" by surviving in their underground catacomb churches shall manage to be among the Elect.  Engleman writes that knowing these truths about the final days allows one to become constantly vigilant in one's faith.  By returning to the Tradition of the Church, one can hope to survive during the coming Tribulation and Reign of Antichrist until Christ comes again.  This book gives an excellent overview of the End Times from the perspective of the Orthodox Christian and clears up many misconceptions that abound.  As a Roman Catholic, I agree with much of what Engleman has to say, particularly about the errors involved in the false doctrines of the \\"Rapture\\" as well as his interpretation of the End Times events.	2003-10-13
US	50058656	R3SYLN1A62F93C	0879683724	553093079	The menace of the herd: Or, Procrustes at large (Studies in conservative philosophy)	Books	5	16	17	N	Y	The Dangers of Herdism.	_The Menace of the Herd_ is an early work by Erik von Kuhnelt-Liddehn (writing under the name Francis Stuart Campbell), the famous German Roman Catholic Rightist and anti-democrat, written near the end of the Second World War.  The subtitle of this book is Procrustes at Large, and Kuhnelt-Liddehn bases his argument around the Greek myth of Procrustes who made individuals fit his bed by either stretching them or cutting off their legs  standing for inflexibility and the herdist desire for levelling.  In this book, Kuhnelt-Liddehn shows the dangers of herdism  seen in democratic levelling, identitarianism, and collectivism  and opposes this to the traditional Christian principles emhasizing morality, personalism, liberty, aristocratism, and monarchy.  The author writes much against the developments of modern man in both technology and government, with a pastoralist hankering for tradition, an agriculturally based life (including the tradition of private property), and religion as revealed in medieval society and in the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church.  The author sees much in city life which lends itself to herdism and much in modern democracy which is really ochlocracy (mob rule).  To the author, technological developments and modern progress have negative aspects which are so conveniently overlooked and hidden from view by their modern trumpeters.  Opposed to these developments and to modern industrialized, democratized, levelled, and urbanized culture stands the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church, Christian morality, and the tradition of monarchy.  The authors advocation of monarchy may appear extreme; however, the author notes that a just monarch rules his subjects out of love (monarchy consists in loving obedience to a just monarch just as one may give oneself freely to a lover in love) and often in monarchies of the past individuals have enjoyed more liberties than in modern day democracies (which amount to ochlocracies).  Many other thinkers of the past including Plato, Aristotle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and de Toquenville have found democracy (tyranny of the masses or tyranny of the majority) to be problematic.  It is this worship of identity and conformism as opposed to difference and diversity as well as a levelling effect based on equality which crushes all difference and genuine diversity (as opposed to the false form of diversity which is merely egoistic individualism).  This effect may be seen in both the movements of Communism and Fascism (and National Socialism) in which collectivistic, nationalistic, and identitarian (often racist) elements emerge to enforce sameness.  In the second half of the book, the author turns his attention to both Germany and America with reference to recent history (the First and Second World Wars).  The author finds much to criticize in the Second and Third Reichs of recent German history following the First World War.  Against these regimes the author yearns for the Roman Catholic German empire free from herdist instincts gone mad.  The author next turns his attention to England and what grew from its colonies, America  the United States and its republic.  The author notes that America lacks a titled aristocracy and that this leads to a constant craving for success and achievement among its citizens.  The author is critical of the democratic and herdist elements within American society and contrasts these elements with European society.  Finally, the author turns his attention to the Second World War.  The author notes that this war involves an epic conflict, but that it must be fought over liberty and not democracy (which in fact is more represented by the Axis forces, both Hitler and Mussolini being democratically elected and enjoying mass appeal).  The author argues for a just peace and for a peace agreement with Germany that is both humane and truly Christian  as opposed to one which is based entirely on the lust for vengeance.  Finally, the author contrasts a mere leader (such as Hitler or Mussolini or even the American President) who is a man of the people with a ruler, who often resides completely outside the people as in the old monarchical tradition.  It is the herdist tendency in man which poses such a threat to his liberty and to his great traditions, prime among them the religious tradition embodied in Christianity, which the author argues so vehemently against.  In an era which has seen the rise of totalitarian regimes, it is important that we heed the words of individuals like Kuhnelt-Liddehn (a.k.a. Samuel Francis Capbell) in our assessment of the dangers of democracy and the readiness with which man can surrender his liberties and give into the rule of the mad mob, i.e. ochlocracy.  Since the French Revolution, egalitarian and democratic tendencies have proliferated within government and their dangers must be noted as we witness the rise of totalitarian regimes with full support of the people.  Like all his books, _The Menace of the Herd_ abounds in obscure references and useful quotes and pieces of information and reveals the author's learning and profound mind.  Complete with footnotes and appendix this book offers a challenging assessment of the modern world and man's need to overcome his base (herdist) instinct.	2003-09-30
US	50058656	R3PAG4KG343QI3	0385492316	378196514	Windswept House: A Vatican Novel	Books	5	26	30	N	N	The Satanic Plot in the Vatican Against the Pope.	Traditionalist Roman Catholic Father Malachi Martin's novel _Windswept House_ takes a look into the strange world of Vatican politics and intrigue within the larger setting of the world at large.  Father Malachi Martin, Roman Catholic priest, former Jesuit, exorcist, and an associate of Pope John XXIII and Cardinal Augustin Bea, presents the reader with a fictionalized account of a global conspiracy in league with Satanists and freemasonry to take control of the Roman Catholic church and to oust \\"the Slavic Pope\\" (Pope John Paul II).  While this book is a work of fiction, Malachi Martin has stated that much of what is presented here is in fact based upon truth, including allegations of Satanic activity within the Vatican during the 1960s.  The book consists of endless plots and counter-plots among Cardinals and prelates of the church in an effort to unseat the Slavic Pope and place a liberal, modernist pope upon the Throne of Peter in league with Satan's plan for the church.  Only a small band of those who adhere to the traditional teachings of the church (with emphasis on the Tridentine mass), including two brothers from a wealthy Texas family (the Gladstone's), are able to offer resistance against the forces of evil within the church hierarchy.  The book alleges conspiracy of the highest order, Satanic activity and possession within the Vatican and within the church hierarchy (especially in America), pedophilia and homosexual activity within the church and among its priests and bishops, as well as the prevelance of freemasons among the Catholic Cardinalate.  While the book is written under the guise of fiction, one cannot help to see many of the current problems within the church in wide-angle focus after reading this book.  Father Martin is not the first to point these problems out, and he belongs to a group of Traditionalist Catholics who look askance upon (some of) the documents of Vatican II, adhere to the Tridentine mass, and believe that current problems inthe church could be resolved if the Pope were to take a stronger stance (and listen to the warnings of the Virgin Mother, especially as revealed at Fatima).  The book ends with a cliffhanger and one is not sure what to make of it at the end, much as one is not sure what to make of modern day Roman Catholicism (especially in America) which has become infested with the heresy of modernism and liberalism.  Much of the book consists of geopolitical intrigue (of the old-school variety), showing how a club of elite businessmen and politicians have turned towards Satan and his \\"humanistic\\" offerings in their efforts to create a New World Order.  For these elite, the Roman Catholic Church represents an outmoded medieval residue; nevertheless, they believe the takeover of this institution is useful because it has so many members which can be unified.  Indeed, the theme of unity plays an important part in this book, in which the chief conspirators (cardinals) call upon the ideal of \\"unity\\" to force the Slavic Pope's hand in a \\"Protocol of Resignation\\".  Indeed it is these global unity schemes, which are of greatest danger to Christ and His Church today.  For those individuals who feel disaffected by the modern post-Vatican II church, a book such as this may offer some guidance in trying to maintain the traditions of the church.  For others who read this book, it will provide food for thought at the very least.  While I believe it is wrong to leave the church (especially during a time of mass apostasy) as some in the more narrow reaches of \\"traditionalism\\" or the extremist position of \\"sedevacantism\\" have decided to do, we must be wary of those developments which have taken place within the church and among its hierarchy which are directly opposed to its traditional teaching.  The book leaves one with a question, and the question is how is one to remain true to the teachings of the church within the modern world and given the influences of the modern world on the church itself.  Of course, in the book, not even the pope is capable of making such a decision (at least not easily).<br />Father Malachi Martin (who will be sorely missed among traditionalists) recently died as he was working on another book about the Vatican and the New World Order.  While his books should be read with caution (and perhaps some skepticism), they offer the ready a unique look into the mind of a traditionalist Catholic living in the modern world.	2003-09-30
US	50058656	R1R2OH8DUTZH0D	0801862655	828644807	The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism	Books	5	26	40	N	N	Catholic Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent.	Since the convening of the Second Vatican Council during the reign of Pope John XXIII, many adjustments and renovations have been made to the Roman Catholic Church and to its traditions, including among other things traditional teachings on religious liberty and ecumenism as well as alterations made to the mass during the reign of Pope Paul VI.  With the subsequent turbulent era of the 1960s and the social revolution which ensued, changes within the church continued to be made, often completely without justification.  Today, many of those in the church of a liberal or progressive mind argue for even further changes in the Catholic Christian tradition, abandoning traditional morality and the teachings of the church, justified by calling upon the \\"Spirit of Vatican II\\".  In a document referred to as the _Syllabus of Errors_ issued by Pope Pius IX on December 8, 1864, well before Vatican II, the notion that the pope \\"can and should reconcile himself to, or agree with, progress, liberalism, or modern civilization\\" was explicitly condemned.  Many conservatives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church hold this document to be sacrosanct and see within the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent developments which have taken place within the church a direct contradiction to this traditional teaching and thus the heresy of modernism.  This book serves as a sociological study examining some of the reactionary movements which have arisen in opposition either directly to Vatican II or to the subsequent liberalization of the church (especially the American church, under the spell of the heresy of Americanism and often rejecting the authority of the Roman Pontiff).  The author divides these movements into three types:  the conservative reaction, the traditionalist and Catholic separatist movements, and the mystical Marianist and apocalypticist movements which rely on private revelation to fill an absence of authority.  Among conservative groups within the church, many adhere strongly to a document proliferated by Pope Paul VI (who is otherwise regarded with some suspicion especially by traditionalists for \\"changing the mass\\").  This document referred to as _Humanae Vitae_ issued by Paul VI in 1968, explicitly condemns birth control for Catholics and reasserts traditional Catholic teaching on sexual morality.  Among the Catholic conservatives, abortion and birth control are regarded as part of the same problem involving loose sexual morals within American society.  While conservatives affirm Vatican II and the subsequent \\"post-conciliar\\" popes (as well as the validity of the new mass, although they may not particularly like it), they continue to believe that many in the church are corrupted by liberalism and various heresies and thus have taken it upon themselves to enforce the Catholic tradition within the church and society at large.  The author of this book considers such conservative groups as Catholics United for the Faith (CUF), E. Michael Jones and his _Fidelity Magazine_, and the writers of the conservative Catholic newspaper called _The Wanderer_.  The author also examines such conservative thinkers as James Hitchcock and devotes an entire chapter to anti-abortion activism.  Many of the more extreme Catholic anti-abortionists believe that the current pro-life movement is unable to stop abortion and that more direct action must be taken, among these is Joseph Scheidler.  Opposed to the conservatives and to the documents of the Second Vatican Council (and often to the subsequent popes) are the Catholic traditionalists, who often operate in complete separation from the modern Catholic church.  These individuals feel strongly that the current mass is not valid (or at least potentially invalid) and adhere strictly to the traditional Tridentine mass in Latin.  Among traditionalist options include the Society of Saint Pius X (started by Archbishop Lefebvre, who dissented at Vatican II) and the subsequent breakaway Society of SaintPius V (which broke away from Lefebvre because he would not take a strong enough stance against the post-conciliar popes).  Among traditionalists, conspiracy minded thinking is common place (with frequent mention to conspiracies of both freemasons and Jews, the traditional enemies of Christ and his church, as well as communists who are believed to have infiltrated the church and the Vatican).  While some traditionalists maintain an open attitude towards whether or not the post-conciliar popes including John Paul II are true popes, others maintain a hard-line attitude arguing that these popes are anti-popes (this position being referred to as \\"sedevacantism\\").  A third movement (often overlapping with the traditionalists) within the reactionary church is that of apocalypticism.  For example, Father Gruner operates a movement which bases itself on the apparition of Mary at Fatima and the notorious Third Secret of Fatima.  Other Marianists take an even more extreme position with regard to the church, often believing that the current pope is an anti-pope, proclaiming themselves pope such as Father John Gregory of the Apostles of Infinite Love has done, or arguing through prophecy that Pope Paul VI was replaced by an imposter as the seeress Veronica Leuken and her Bayside movement have done.  Others have argued that many of these movements are diabolical in nature and that they represent an attempt to fill a vacuum in authority left by the current church leaders.  Since the modern church especially in America after Vatican II has moved so far away from the traditional Catholic teaching, it is to be expected that such reactionary movements would arise which attempt to preserve their tradition.  While those in the more extreme wings of the traditionalist movement and those among the apocalypticists have often left the institutional church entirely, it is the conservative Catholics who adhere to the actual teachings of the popes more so than their liberal counterparts.  This book provides a good introduction to many of the reactionary movements within the church as they attempt to offer opposition to the current liberalism run rampant throughout.	2003-09-28

Democracy is the Tivil's [devil's] government.  - Benjamin Rush.<br />In dictatorships one has to howl with the wolves . . . and in democracies one has to bleat with the sheep.  - Hermann Funke.<br />_Leftism Revisited_ by Erik von Kuehnelt-Liddihn is a strange book written by a Roman Catholic German Rightist who is at once anti-democratic and pro-monarchy and has described himself as an anarchist of the far right.  The book attempts to show the evils of Leftism and democracy (which is a slippery slope to tyranny - as witnessed by many great thinkers including such notables as Plato and de Toqueville) as they are defined by the author.  The author notes that traditionally the left hand side has been associated with evil and sorcery while Our Lord Jesus Christ was taken up to rule at the RIGHT hand of the Father in heaven.  In parliaments, those who advocate democracy or some form of socialism or communism occupy the seats on the Left while those who advocate tradition occupy the seats on the Right.  For the author, a liberal is defined as a lover of liberty, and thus may be a Rightist, which is directly opposed to the modern American understanding of this term, which in fact means just the opposite.  The author begins by contrasting identity and diversity.  To the author, the Leftist cannot tolerate any diversity among individuals at all, and thus advocates an identitarian politics based on democratic levelling and the conceit of \\"equality\\" as opposed to \\"liberty\\".  The author then moves on to discussing the origins of Leftism in various chiliastic, Gnostic, and millenialist heresies which proliferated during the Middle Ages and before.  The author notes that Original Sin and the Fall from Grace is the cause of the existence of the State.  Radical sects such as the Hussites and splinter sects off of this group advocated religious and political extremism and anticlericalism.  To the author, the Reformation of Luther represents a conservative reaction against the Renaissance humanism which had made its way into the Roman Catholic Church.  The author generally sees Luther in a favorable light, although he notes where Luther contrasts specifically with Catholicism, as he represents a monastic reaction against it.  On the other hand, the author sees Calvin in a less favorable light and sees in him a precursor to many of the Leftist movements.  The author then turns his attention to early America and the American War for Independence (not really a \\"Revolution\\" at all).  Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States were opposed to democracy and some advocated a return to monarchy.  The author next examines the French Revolution which led to mass bloodshed and the wickedness of the Marquis de Sade.  According to the author, many Leftists seem obsessed with the thought of total destruction - destruction of man, of the world, and of all of God's Creation.  In this sense, they can be described as anti-theists, such is their hatred for God.  The author examines some of the socialistic and romantic ideas which circulated during this period - such as those of Fourier and Jean Jacques Rousseau (another Genevan along with Calvin).  Next the author turns his attention to the birth of communism by contrasting the anarchist Proudhon with Karl Marx.  The author finds Karl Marx to be virtually diabolically in his deceit and hatred of all who disagreed with him in the slightest.  Finally the author examines the identitarian politics, racism combined with socialism and nationalism, of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.  Nearly all theorists consider Hitler and the Nazis to be \\"on the Right hand side of the political spectrum\\".  However, the author shows how Hitler's socialism and identitarianism are in fact manifestations of Leftism.  In the second part of the book, the author turns to a critique of American foreign policy during the First and Second World War and after.  The author shows the absurdities behind the worship of Wilson and FDR which manyAmericans continue to contribute to as well as the hatred of Germans which existed at that time.  The author suggests something conspiratorial in the way the Allies and the Russians divided Germany after the war as well as in the usage of the atomic bomb and the bombings of Dresden during the war.  The author next discusses the Vietnam War and the regime of Pol Pot as well as the Leftist deceit which took place during this era.  The author ends this book with a discussion of the outlook for the future as well as the need for an \\"ideology of the Right\\" and presents a scheme for a \\"utopia of the Right\\".  This book is full of information and obscure references and the argument it makes is unique.  With a preface from William F. Buckley, _Leftism Revisited_ is a severely iconoclastic book which will be adored by those on the Right (those who oppose identitarianism, democratic levelling, and socialism and who believe in monarchism, aristocraticism, tradition, and liberty) and despised by those on the Left (those who worship a false equality and advocate identitarianism).  The authors advocation of monarchy may appear extreme to many and combined with his individualist bent, he may be considered something of a synthesis between individualist anarchism and monarchism - an anarcho-monarchist, something quite unique in the realm of political discourse.	2003-09-28

The Bolsheviks who created the Soviet Union did much to portray Russian culture under the Tsars as backward and the Russian peasant as illiterate and prone to superstition; however, as one sees by reading this book many individuals within the Soviet Union themselves had elaborate occult and esoteric beliefs.  While the Soviet Union tried to ban writers and intellectuals and suppress all religion or \\"irrational\\" developments of the human spirit, this effort largely failed due to the very creative nature of man (so misunderstood by Marxists).  Russian culture has always been influenced by surviving pagan beliefs and through the Christian tradition preserved in the Russian Orthodox Church; however, influences from freemasonry, Swedenborgianism and spiritism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Eastern religions, and other occultists such as Gurdjieff and his interpreter Ouspensky have also played an important role in shaping the occult underground culture in Russia.  In addition, various German philosophical idealists such as Kant, Schelling, and Hegel came to play an important part in the development of Russian thought along with iconoclasts such as Nietzsche and romantics and anarchists.  This book includes a brief introduction to the occult culture in Russian and Soviet thought and various essays, followed by a conclusion dealing with modern developments in Russian culture.  Essays included are an essay on folk magic and divination among the Russian peasantry with emphasis on the survival of paganism and the role of the Russian Orthodox Church; an essay on the role of the peasant and the occult in Russian literature with reference to the authors Ivan Turgenev, Andrei Bely, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; an essay on the role of the Jewish Kabbalah in Russian occultism including reference to Christian Sophiologists including the theologians Vladimir Solovyov, Pavel Florensky, and Sergei Bulgakov; an essay on the role of Satanism with emphasis on the role of Satan in the Orthodox Churches and Russian tradition as well as mention of the novels of Andrei Bely; an essay on \\"fashionable occultism\\" including reference to the Theosophical and Anthroposophical societies, spiritualism, and freemasonry; an essay on the thought of Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov; an essay on Russian cosmism which included ideas on space exploration and immortality with reference to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Biocosmist and panpsychist; an essay on technology and the role of the Soviet engineer; an essay on occult socialist realism (interestingly occult ideas based upon the Christian veneration of saints were behind the Soviet action taken in preserving Lenin's body); an essay on the filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein and the role of the occult and gnosticism in his thinking; an essay on Vsevolod Ivanov; an essay on Daniil Andreev famous mystic and writer who combined world religions in what he termed \\"The Rose of the World\\"; and a concluding essay on the role of occultism in politics which mentions various Russian Rightist groups including the Traditionalist thought of Aleksandr Dugin and the role of the infamous antisemitic tract, _Protocols of the Elders of Zion_.  In sum, this book constitutes an enormous compendium of material on various occultists, writers and groups, as well as a useful bibliography including details about various obscure journals and rare books, and will prove invaluable to the researcher in esoteric thought.  Many in America are largely ignorant of the alternative belief systems which exist among the Russians and which existed under the Soviet tyranny, and hopefully this book will prove a useful tool to alleviating that ignorance.  For all those interested in alternative modes of perceiving reality and in discarded belief systems, the ideas presented inthis book will prove to be a fascinating look at the deep recesses of the Russian (and Soviet) psyche.	2003-09-23

Others have already pointed out that this book abides by various Marxist and postmodern modes of thinking and therefore cannot be fully trusted.  In fact, the first two chapters do not discuss paganism at all, but focus strictly on the author's theories of cultural and moral relativism.  Of course, these types of theories are self-refuting, and the idea that race is somehow a cultural construct is ridiculous (ask any man on the street if he thinks the Irish are \\"white\\" and he will reply \\"of course\\"), however that has never stopped academia from trumpeting such things.  Most ridiculous of all however are some of the author's conspiracy theories about public figures which contend that \\"culture\\" is to be interpreted as \\"race\\", making many well known public figures into \\"racists\\".  Whatever.  The second chapter is mostly devoted to racist organizations, the Ku Klux Klan, Christian patriots, and the Christian Identity movement.  Interestingly, many of those in the Ku Klux Klan have recently teamed up with racist black nationalists.  This is interesting because if one were to try to get these groups together using the rhetoric of \\"diversity\\" and \\"multicutlural tolerance\\" they would never meet.  However, by pushing each of these groups to the limits of their own egotism they meet somewhere on the other side of the political circle.  By the third chapter however, the author finally turns around to discussion of the pagan revival.  He begins with such things as Wicca and contrasts this to Asatru and Odinism.  Various individuals in these movements are discussed and a history of pagan beliefs is examined.  The author seems to have some trouble distinguishing between many pagans who advocate outright racism (such as David and Katja Lane and Ron McVan) and those who are merely \\"ethnic\\" pagans who advocate a more libertarian and separatist philosophy.  It seems to me that many of these pagans combine a form of fascism and anarchism in what is termed \\"tribal socialism\\" (which the author feels to resemble the ideal of Jeffersonianism).  Pagans who advocate such things are radical localists who believe in ties to family, clan, and race, and thus perhaps constitute a truer perception of conservativism than the current elites running the \\"conservative\\" parties.  An interesting discussion of both Native American \\"nationalist\\" and European pagan nationalists is discussed with respect to the recently found Kennewick man skeleton, whose origins may be European indicating the presence of Europeans in America not only before Columbus but well before the \\"Native\\" Americans as well.  The author moves on to various forms of Odinism and Satanism (darkside Asatru, in which Loki the trickster god is perceived to be the shadow side of Odin the Allfather, in Jungian terms).  Here, certain famous individuals such as Michael Moynihan and Steven Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson) who have both helped translate various works on paganism, runic mythology, magic, German rune magicians, and Julius Evola are discussed.  Finally, the political extremism of the White Order of Thule is discussed in relationship to the neoNazi National Alliance.  While the author's liberal and postmodern bias is unfortunate as other reviewers have already pointed out, the book does include some good discussion of some of the pagan, Odinist, Asatru, and other groups and alliances which make up the modern day revival of Norse and panEuropean pagan beliefs.  In this respect, the book is good and probably worth reading if you can get through the first two chapters.  On the other hand, since the author is basically a journalist his accounts are probably not to be fully trusted.  In this respect, one must do one's own research to fully understand the revival of paganism in the United States.	2003-09-14
US	50058656	RK139VL6OQOQJ	0226320669	945922174	The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek)	Books	5	35	42	N	N	The Socialist Conceit.	_The Fatal Conceit_ written by economist F. A. Hayek is a firm rejection of economic planning and socialism in favor of classical liberalism and private ownership of &quot;several property&quot; from an agnostic evolutionary perspective.  Hayek argues that morality cannot be founded based upon reason alone but that its foundation must be found within the traditional structures that make up society.  He argues this from an evolutionary perspective claiming that morality has evolved and therefore been selected for and therefore that it is naive of us to believe that through reason alone we can determine what is ethical.  This is in agreement with a religious perspective that would claim that the morality-bearing tradition has been handed down to man from a source which involved an encounter with the Divine (of course, the religious perspective would deny evolution but would arrive at the same conclusion based upon revelation).  Hayek, himself an agnostic, discusses these issues in his book and shows how religion can serve as a guardian of tradition.  One specific tradition that exists within Western culture is that of private ownership of &quot;several property&quot;.  Hayek argues that socialism rests on a conceit and is often rooted in an irrational longing for a primitive time (primitivism).  Hayek shows how many philosophers and economists including Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas (&quot;the just wage theory&quot;), Karl Marx, Keynes, and Einstein advocated some form of socialism and shows the errors in various aspects of their thinking.  Hayek is particularly harsh to Keynes who spoke against the traditional value assigned to saving money, which Hayek feels is absurd.  Hayek then shows how socialism is presented as a trade-off; however, involved in this trade-off is the substantial loss of liberty, a value all people should hold dear.  Hayek demonstrates how language itself has become infested with words which take on socialistic meanings, and Hayek shows that the veryword &quot;liberal&quot; has come to mean the exact opposite of its original intention, i.e. a lover of liberty.  Hayek roundly refutes the Malthusian theory of population growth and argues against the over-population scare which is used by the Club of Rome to advance their population control agenda.  Hayek shows that in regions which become industrialized and modernized the population growth decreases.  This means as more and more regions trade in their premodern existence for an industrialized one the population growth in these regions will go down.  The final chapter concludes with a discussion of the role of religion in preserving the traditional system of morality and Hayek's own agnostic philosophy.  Hayek argues that it is naive of some to view religion as a conspiracy of the priestly caste to maintain their power, and he shows the value that religious beliefs may have.  While I agree with this assessment in Hayek's discussion of religion, I disagree with his agnosticism and failure to recognize a personalized God.  Hayek ends with several appendices which discuss various other approaches to economic liberty.  In sum this book presents an excellent refutation of the &quot;socialist superstition&quot; which continues to haunt the minds of the intellectual elite to this day.	2003-09-14

In _The German Intellectual Quest for India_, the author Dietmar Rothermund presents a survey of some of the German intellectuals who developed an interest in the Indian continent during the Eighteenth Century.  Rothermund writes that many German intellectuals developed an interest in the continent of Indian after they were presented with many different ideas brought back to Europe by German Christian missionaries.  German individuals who developed an interest in India at that time including such noteworthies as Matthias Sprengel the historian who wrote \\"The History of the Marathas\\", the Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schlegel who wrote in praise of the language of Sanskrit and learned this language himself, the philosopher Hegel who wrote on India in his philosophy of history, Karl Marx who wrote an essay on India's fate under British colonization, the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer who based much of his work on the Indian philosophy of Vedanta and Buddhist philosophy, the philosopher and Sanskrit scholar Paul Deussen, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who was early on enthused by the work of Schopenhauer as well as by the codification of the caste system in _The Laws of Manu_, Max Muller the famous Indian scholar who relocated from Germany to England and translated many of the sacred texts into English from his university post at Oxford, and the German sociologist Max Weber who wrote on the nature of the Indian religion.  The book includes separate chapters detailing the lives of Matthias Christian Sprengel, the historian who never visited Indian but wrote a history of the Marathas, Friedrich Schlegel, the father of the Romantic philosophy and a Catholic convert who emphasized the language of Sanskrit and argued for a \\"regressive evolution\\", and Max Muller, the great Indian scholar and Christian who unfortunately never was able to visit India.  Questions concerning many of these thinkers and many thinkers in India included the role of language and Sanskrit as auniversal language, the nationalist question and the problem of British colonization, the relationship between Christianity and Hinduism, and the role of the myth of the \\"Aryan\\" race.  Of course, later individuals and tyrants such as Adolf Hitler would come to abuse the myth of the Aryan race to set up their dictatorships.  Many of the German philosophers occupied with India were of course Christian missionaries; however, they developed a genuine interest in Indian philosophy, culture, and religion and allowed certain of these ideas to grow within the European continent.  The author notes that while many individuals in Europe of the liberal persuasion turned to America as an ideal, those of a more conservative persuasion tended to turn to India and its spiritual resources, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Indian and Eastern thought continues to occupy a prominent role among many European individuals even though India has finally achieved its independence from the British colonizers.  Many believe that the unique spiritual resources of the Indian subcontinent offer hope for a renewed spiritual invigoration in the West.  Preceded by these early Germanic thinkers, many in the West have developed a newfound interest in Indian culture, religion, and philosophy in recent times and have hoped to import many of these ideas into the Western culture.	2003-08-06

In _The Road to Serfdom_ the Nobel Prize winning economist F. A. Hayek makes a profound case against socialism and economic planning in favor of the traditional \\"classical liberal\\" position, which originally consisted of advocates of the principle of \\"laissez-faire\\".  Arguing from the point of view of such classical liberals as J. S. Mill, Alexis de Toqueville (who inspired the title of this book), Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, and Lord Acton (\\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\"), as well as economists of the \\"Austrian school\\" and von Mises, Hayek argues that what was (and still is) termed \\"liberalism\\" in his day is in fact an abdication of the true ideal of liberty in favor of a redefinition of this term.  Hayek shows how socialism and economic planning, such as that advocated by economists such as Keynes for example, have failed in both Russia and Germany.  According to Hayek, economic interventionism, planning, and centralization are leading the state on \\"the road to serfdom\\" and destroying individual liberty.  Fundamental to any notion of liberty is the belief in private property and Hayek argues that liberty is impossible without private property following Hume.  While many who might advocate socialism will accept that liberty is impossible without private property, they still continue to push their ideology because they believe it will somehow enable man to focus on \\"higher things\\".  Hayek argues that this itself is a conceit and shows the fundamental importance of economics and money in our lives.  Hayek wrote this book near the end of the Second World War, and he shows that many of the socialists in Britain were coming close to advocating the same principles which were used by Hitler to establish his dictatorship.  In particular, the works of the socialist theorist Werner Sombart played an important role in the economic understanding of the Third Reich.  Hayek suggests that Nazism was made possible by German socialism and that in fact many individuals on one side of the communist/Nazi split could easily go back and forth between the two alternating in their hatred for the West.  Many in the Third Reich regime such as Moeller van den Bruck, railed against the \\"West\\" (as it was understood by them, not the meaning it is given now where it would of course include the German nation) and its institutions as well as the ideals of classical liberalism.  Hayek shows that there are indeed totalitarians in our midst who in the name of security will abolish our economic freedoms if given the opportunity to do so.  While the United States claim to abide by capitalism, it continues to amount a burgeoning government bureaucracy and a monstrous \\"welfare-warfare state\\".  Individuals such as Hilaire Belloc and Herbert Spencer had pointed out the dangers in such notions as socialism and statism earlier in the century, and Hayek has taken off from many of their writings.  Hayek argues that socialism is a product of Germanic thought while he affirms the thought of certain individuals in Britain such as John Stuart Mill against the Germans.  These remarks can probably be understood in the light of his times which had just witnessed a world confrontation against Fascism and National Socialism.  Hayek concludes with a chapter on internationalism which he advocates in the classical liberal sense, but he also shows the dangers involved in the kind of \\"world unity\\" schemes which were then being devised and were to take shape in such bodies as the League of Nations and the United Nations.  My copy of this book includes an excellent introduction by another Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman.  In this introduction Friedman makes two points which I believe are worth mentioning.  First, he argues that it is ironic that many of those regarded as the intellectual elite continue to accept the ideal of collectivism against that of individualism, basing their arguments on emotion and not on reason.  Secondly, he notes the irony of the fact that socialist nations such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, and the former East Germany had to develop walls to keep their citizens within, while capitalist nations have been forced to use police forces to keep too many people from coming in.  This itself illustrates the great failure of the socialist ideal.  While the intellectual \\"elite\\" continue to cling to their dying ideal of socialism and disparage individuals such as Hayek, history shows that their schemes will result in failure.  Hopefully, they will continue to be opposed in the future by all people who consider themselves lovers of liberty, in the true sense of the word.cialist nations such as the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, and the former East Germany had to develop walls to keep their citizens within, while capitalist nations have been forced to use police forces to keep too many people from coming in.

After the Second World War a campaign has been underway from within certain constituencies of \\"progressive Catholic\\" circles to legitimize freemasonry.  Freemasonry has been condemned repeatedly by popes since Clement XII in 1738.  The reasons for this repeated condemnation include the immorality of the secret oaths undertaken by masonic initiates, the fundamental conflict between masonic belief and Roman Catholic dogma (i.e. Christian belief), and the subversive aspects of a secret society which continues to plot against church, government, and the established traditionalist based order.  However, despite these problematic concerns and fundamental differences between Freemasonry and Catholicism, certain individuals have attempted to urge the hierarchy to remove the ban of excommunication upon those Catholics who become Freemasons.  De Poncins quotes at length from two works by the \\"progressive Catholic\\" writer Alec Mellor (_Our Separated Brethren_ and _La Franc-Maconnerie a l'Heure du Choix_) which attempt to legitimize freemasonry and integrate it into Catholicism.  Mellor proposes a concocted \\"progressive Catholicism\\" against what he regards as integrism and traditionalism.  It is this \\"progressive Catholicism\\" which has taken over the church by storm in the debacle and confusion following the Second Vatican Council.  De Poncins clearly shows the dangers of such an approach to masonry and continues to demonstrate that masonry is fundamentally at odds with Roman Catholicism.  De Poncins outlines the role of masonry in the French Revolution, the relationships between Judaism and Masonry, and the gnosticism and even Satanism which lurks behind masonry's supposed rationalistic, atheistic (Enlightenment) worldview.  The two forms of masonry - regular and irregular - are discussed by de Poncins in detail as well as the connections between (European) Continental and Anglo-American freemasonry.  Finally, the supposedly fundamental differences between masonry and communism are shown to be illusory.  De Poncins demonstrates that masonry did indeed play a role in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and shows how the communist-anarchists in Spain were under the influence of masonry as well as the Hungarian communists led by Bela Kun.  De Poncins concludes with a chapter on what he regards as the major factors involved in twentieth century masonry.  Here he provides documentation revealing connections between masonry and the assassination which provoked the First World War.  Also a thorough examination of certain curious aspects of President Roosevelt's policies with regard to the Russians during the Second World War and the Yalta agreement are examined.  Again, the role of masonry is found to be prominent.  In an article entitled \\"How we won the war and lost the peace\\", W. Bullitt a former American ambassador to Moscow explains the travesty of the communist Soviet victory during the Second World War.  By allowing the partition of Germany and the requisition of Eastern Europe by the Soviets, the Allies allowed a situation to occur which resulted in the creation of the Cold War.  De Poncins ends his book with a discussion of a certain society of \\"progressive Catholics\\" within communist Poland called \\"Pax\\".  De Poncins shows that \\"Pax\\" is in fact nothing more nor less than a communist-freemasonic front attempting to infiltrate the Catholic Church within Poland.  The poor state of the church and its hierarchy within the communist country of Poland is explained by de Poncins and the role such secret organizations as \\"Pax\\" have in furthering that state while collaborating with a communist totalitarian regime is shown.  This book provides a good examination of the fundamental and secret warfare between the forces of light represented by Christ's Catholic Church and the forces of subversion represented by secret societies.nd the forces of subversion represented by secret societies.	2003-07-15
US	50058656	R1DPG22JFFDIJ3	1859845177	921827520	Politicide: Ariel Sharon's War Against the Palestinians	Books	5	21	33	N	N	Ariel Sharon and the Palestinians.	_Politicide_ by Baruch Kimmerling is a highly controversial work dealing with the politically charged conflict in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians.  In the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 many Americans have turned to Israel and its leader Ariel Sharon as a fundamental ally in a conflict with what is perceived as a terroristic menace arising out of the Arab world.  President George W. Bush has declared a \\"War on Terror\\" and has enlisted the support of the Israeli regime under the control of Sharon in his fight against Arab terrorism.  However, as this book shows total and complete support by Americans for Israel may be highly problematic.  Baruch Kimmerling argues from a particular point of view and presents Sharon as a right wing dictator who is attempting to politically neutralize the Palestinian people.  Kimmerling traces the history of Zionism and Sharon's particular biography in his rise to power from a general in the Israeli army to a political opportunist.  On February 6, 2001 Ariel Sharon was elected Prime Minister of Israel.  Since that time according to Kimmerling, a systematic attempt has been made by Sharon to root out the Palestinian people and remove their political presence from Israel.  Kimmerling shows by examining the history of Israel and the military career of Sharon that various crimes have been committed against the Palestinian people.  In retaliation, many of these Palestians have been forced to engage in terrorist tactics - \\"the last weapon of the weak\\".  The Middle Eastern conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is perhaps the most geopolitically charged conflict in the world today.  It continues to result in tragedy for all concerned and oppression.  Various religious \\"fundamentalisms\\" (including Christian Zionists) regard the return of the Jews to the Holy Land as a fulfillment of prophecy and the first step along the way towards the Second Coming of Christ.  In addition, many Jewish and Christian fundamentalists (including former President Bill Clinton) believe the Temple of Solomon is located beneath the Temple Mount.  However, this Temple Mount is currently the location of the mosque al-Aqsa, the third holiest shrine in Islam.  It is within this mythically charged situation that the conflict between world religions and indigenous peoples of the Middle East exists.  Individuals such as Sharon believe the Jews have a mandate for the Holy Land and believe in the continual expansion of the borders of the Jewish Israeli state.  However this presents a particularly troublesome demographics problem in that it would result in Jews becoming a minority within their nation.  For the Israeli \\"right wing\\", this is a troublesome issue.  On the other hand, Palestinians continue to feel oppressed by a people who they do not recognize as having rights to their land.  I do not believe there will be an easy or even any solution to this question; however, the potential travesty that can and continues to result within the Holy Land may one day escalate to apocalyptic proportions.  In the meantime, the United States continues to face the menace of Arab terrorism and the Israelis and Palestinians continue to do battle with each other.	2003-07-15

Unfortunately, the book seems to have a crass biologistic/Darwinistic understanding of race and seems to advocate a system of eugenics and birth control (man viewed as merely a breeding mechanism) as well as rules against miscegenation - things which various popes for example have condemned.  This is problematic for the simple reason that man's genetic nature is far too complicated to fit into these simplistic categories, as well as the biologistic notion of \\"hybrid vigor\\".  A more interesting perspective on race for example is that of the Italian aristocrat Julius Evola who seemed to view \\"Aryan\\" as a spiritual principle and argued against the notion of race advocated by \\"breeders\\".  Also the book fails to take into account such things as for example the contribution of the Arabian culture in preserving Aristotle for the Europeans throughout the \\"Dark Ages\\".  The book does however offer a far more realistic picture of racial struggle and race war than any liberal (politically correct) historian is likely to admit to.  The fact is that race remains a problem in the world, that racial differences and genetic malformities do exist in man and that the achievements of the White Race are being undermined by the forces of subversion.  While the threat from Soviet Russia in the book has largely been superseded, Communist China continues to remain a powerful threat to the continued growth of the American nation.  In this sense, a real conflict of cultures can be seen between the Western European individualistic culture and the Chinese collectivistic one.  I give this book four stars not because I agree with much of its content, but because it offers a novelty item which may be more honest on the issue of race than many liberal historians care to admit.	2003-07-14

De Poncins examines the secret societies and the secret orders which underlie the freemasonic lodges and the causes of the French Revolution.  De Poncins places much of the blame for the Terror of 1789 on the freemasonic lodges themselves.  According to de Poncins, these lodges seek to overthrow the current traditionalist based society rooted in the principles of Christianity and in particular Roman Catholicism and replace it with a rationalist, atheist based society.  While individuals involved in freemasonry at the lower levels may be unaware of its true intentions, those in the upper echelons of masonry as well as those belonging to various offshoot lodges such as the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt are more fully cognizant of its true intentions.  Thus, masonry is a chief force behind the revolutionary movements of both the French and Russian revolutions.  De Poncins also turns his attention to Judaism and the role both Judaism and Freemasonry have played in the creation of the First World War as well as the horrors of Soviet Russia.  De Poncins provides a detailed sketch of the beliefs of the Jews as well as providing names and figures which support his thesis of a worldwide Jewish plot behind the Soviet regime.  (See the book _The Rulers of Russia_ by Father Denis Fahey for a similar list of Jewish activities behind Soviet rule, written from a Catholic perspective.)  De Poncins examines such Judaic masonic lodges as B'nai Brith as well as other activities involving international finance and socialism.  It is interesting that certain individuals among the Jewish elite support both international capitalist finanace as well as socialism.  While this remains unexplainable at the naïve level, a proper understanding of the ideals behind Judaism enables one to see how both serve as aspects of the same corrupting system.  De Poncins explains how usury is damaging to the economic system and the role both Judaism and international finance have played in instituting a system of usury.  This book is a must read to provide an understanding of some of the secret movements underlying the revolutionary forces in the world of the twentieth century.  It also includes a very worthy bibliography including works in English, French, and German of interest.orrupting system.

This short book _Saint Athanasius:  Defender of the Faith_ by Michael Davies offers an important contribution to the traditionalist movement within Roman Catholicism.  Saint Athanasius was a Christian saint and bishop who risked excommunication by his pope, Pope Liberius, in order to defend his faith from the Arian heresy proliferating at the time.  The Arian heresy was a particularly disastrous heretical movement during the fourth century which was based on the speculations of Arius arguing that the Son was subordinate to the Father.  This particular heresy infested the Christian Church and caused many to fall into error including the Emperor Constantius.  In addition, the pope of the time Pope Liberius may have compromised with this heresy causing him to issue an order of excommunication against Saint Athanasius and to sign certain accords which affirmed Arianism while in exile.  Michael Davies argues that despite the pope's fall, papal infallibility was maintained with regard to ex cathedra pronouncements by the assurance of the Holy Spirit.  A pope may err in certain matters so long as he does not deny a de fide pronouncement when speaking ex cathedra.  During this time, Saint Athanasius consecrated several bishops and priests to serve against the Arian heresy.  This book is a good biography of this saint and offers an example of an heroic Christian who risked his life for the defense of the true faith.  Michael Davies uses the life and times of Saint Athanasius and his pope as an illustration of a similar occurrence which exists within the Catholic faith in modern, post Vatican II times.  In an era of mass apostasy, certain individuals within the traditionalist Catholic movement have attempted to uphold the Catholic faith and tradition from outside of the Church proper.  These individuals have been forced to consecrate bishops without the approval of the current pope resulting in possible excommunications.  An example of such an individual is the Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who took such a stand against the post Vatican II church by consecrating bishops.  Michael Davies and those like him in the traditionalist movement believe that the cases of Archbishop Lefebvre and Saint Athanasius are similar in that they were forced to defend the faith against popes who may have lapsed morally and with regard to disciplinary matters (while maintaining the assured infallibility protected by the Holy Spirit).cel Lefebvre, who took such a stand against the post Vatican II church by consecrating bishops.

This edition was translated from the Greek.  This wisdom and practical advice has been prominent in the Eastern churches since it was compiled by these two spiritual fathers, as well as being used by the monks of Mount Athos in Greece.  The first volume of _The Philokalia_ features the wisdom of such early Eastern Christian monks and desert fathers as Saint Isaiah the Solitary, Evagrios the Solitary, Saint John Cassian, Saint Mark the Ascetic, Saint Hesychios the Priest, Saint Neilos the Ascetic, Saint Diadochos of Photiki, Saint John of Karpathos, and a work attributed to Saint Antony the Great.  Much of the material found here includes practical advice for monks on living a life in Christ as well as advice for overcoming spiritual pride and the deceits of demons.  Included are ways to avoid the demons of the vices:  unchastity, avarice, anger, dejection, listlessness, self-esteem, and pride.  The book offers a beautiful account of the struggle of these monks against the flesh in an attempt to live a holy life in Christ free from the constraints of the outer society.  This first volume of _The Philokalia_ is a great tribute to the Eastern Christian tradition and to its spiritual achievements in attempting to follow Our Lord, Jesus Christ.  It is truly a marvelous volume which gives meaning to a spiritual life.	2003-04-21

This book is the first volume of that work translated from the French.  The Ressourcement movement within Roman Catholicism consisted of several important thinkers who attempted to retrieve and renew Catholicism by returning to its earliest Christian sources.  These thinkers included individuals such as Henri de Lubac as well as Jean Danielou, Yves Congar, Marie-Dominique Chenu, Louis Bouyer, and were associated with the famous theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar.  Their movement played an important role in the theological developments of the Second Vatican Council and influenced the work of Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.<br />This first volume of _Medieval Exegesis_ attempts to trace the origins of the fourfold interpretation of Holy Scripture (interpretations of Scripture in terms of history, allegory, anagogy, and tropology).  The book focuses on hundreds of different early and medieval Christian thinkers and especially the work of the early Christian Platonist Origen who devised this fourfold means of interpretation.  The book discusses fully the nature of interpretation (\\"the Queen of the Arts\\") and the need for spiritual discipline in the light of patristic theology.  The book then turns its attention to the patristic sources including Clement of Alexandria, Saint Augustine, Gregory, Cassian, and Eucher, but especially Origen.  The book fully explores Origen as understood in both the Greek and Latin churches and deals with the troublesome issue of his alleged heresy.  For quite some time, a debate existed in the church as to the status of Origen's soul due to his drift into heresy concerning certain aspects of biblical interpretation.  This book restores Origen's place among early theologians and especially his fourfold sense of mystical interpretation of Scripture.  The book concludes with a discussion of the unity of the two testaments:  Old Testament and New Testament.  As many of the saints had testified to, the Old Testament reveals the New, and the New Testament is revealed in the Old.  The author concludes with a final discussion of the need for the Spirit to enlighten the exegesis of Scripture.  This book (expertly footnoted with reference to many Christian thinkers) provides an excellent introduction to the thought of Henri de Lubac as well as to the understanding of scriptural exegesis and interpretation as it existed in the medieval world and as it is proclaimed still today.	2003-04-20

Rose ferrets out what is most beautiful and noble about the Christian religion and replaces it with old prejudices.  I have no doubt that Satan is working towards the reign of Antichrist in the modern world, by denying man his spiritual birthright.  I also have no doubt that freemasonic influences in the hierarchy of the Catholic church are playing a role in initiating a New World Order under the sway of a one world religion.  However, I have a serious problem with Fr. Rose's bigotry towards non-Christian religions, in particular Hinduism and Zen Buddhism, but also such benign things as science fiction novels and Eastern meditation.  These bigotted comments are really beneath contempt.  God's grace, mercy, and love are truly infinite.  As such they extend EVEN to our Hindu and Muslim brothers and sisters.  I complete disagree with Fr. Rose's narrowly ultra-fundamentalistic worldview which denies anything issuing forth from the Spirit.  This man suffers from a profound inability to face the fact that the greatest man who ever lived was brutally tortured and murdered by the Romans.  Rather than celebrating in remembrance of Him and eagerly awaiting His Second Coming, Fr. Rose embraces desolation and despair.  I believe this book reflects a fundamentally unbalanced mind and is not a good influence for the spiritual seeker or believing Christian.	2003-04-14

This brief book is really a defense of both papal infallibility and the indefectibility of the Church against the challenges posed to these claims by certain members of the traditionalist movement within Catholicism.  Our Lord, Jesus Christ made the promise to Saint Peter, \\"Upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16.18)\\" which thereby guranteed the indefectibility of the church.  The author Michael Davies takes a look at some of the difficulties arising out of the Second Vatican Council and the Novus Ordo Mass.  In particular, it is shown that the church must remain visible and hierarchical contrary to the claims of many who call themselves sedevacantists.  Davies considers the case of an heretical pope, that would be a pope who is notoriously heretical in denying publically a de fide pronouncement, and he argues that other than a single decree from a council that such a pope had thereby forfeited the papacy no deposition could be made of him.  Davies considers historical cases of popes who were condemned (Pope Honorius I) for allowing heresy to proliferate, popes who taught problematical doctrines (Pope John XXII), the case of the Arian heresy in which Saint Athanasius was excommunicated but continued to defend the true faith, and the case of the Great Schism as examples, but he notes that despite these instances the infallibility of the pope when speaking ex cathedra was maintained.  Davies also turns his attention to the new mass of Pope Paul VI.  Davies argues that the Tridentine mass must be preserved, but that the new mass is indeed valid.  These arguments by Davies are important in refuting certain sedevacantists.  This book provides an important contribution to the traditionalist movement within Catholicism and the continued defense of the Christian faith.	2003-04-12
US	50058656	R2CMHCQ52QQVYF	0226753263	551910797	Tradition	Books	5	23	25	N	N	The Need For Tradition.	The book _Tradition_ by Edward Shils is a fine sociological essay examining the role played by tradition in societies and cultures as well as governments, arts, literatures, sciences, and philosophies.  Shils writes that this book is intended to fill a gap in modern sociology, that is the gap which exists because of a neglect to emphasize the role of tradition.  While some sociological theorists such as Max Weber and Vilfredo Pareto (and especially the Christian poet and writer T. S. Eliot) have incorporated notions of tradition into their theories, for the most part modern sociology fails to appreciate the role played by and the need for tradition.  Shils defines tradition in its most basic form to be &quot;a traditium; it is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.  (p. 12)&quot;  All too often those who argue for the need for tradition are dismissed as mere &quot;reactionaries&quot; while the ideal of progress is heralded in opposition.  Shils argues however that the idea of progress itself has constituted a tradition in that the movements and ideologies focusing on progress have outlasted a single generation.  Much of this book is spent explaining the various roles tradition plays in society and in the world of ideas.  Thus, there are chapters focusing on the role of the past, the endurance of past objects, the endurance of past practices, stability and change in tradition, endogenous and exogenous factors behind the change in a tradition, tradition and rationalization, and the prospects of tradition into the future.  While religious practices and governments clearly constitute a tradition, and while movements in literature and the arts also constitute traditions, it is not so obvious that tradition exists in the sciences and philosophy which attempt to base themselves entirely on a rational mode of inquiry.  However, even here Shils argues that science itself and the branches of philosophy are based on a tradition (which is theinherited mode of inquiry itself).  A good part of Shils' book is spent explaining precisely how this tradition plays a part in the sciences and in philosophy as well as other movements which are based on &quot;rationality&quot;.  Thus, it is naive to dismiss tradition as mere superstition or prejudice when it in fact underlies the sciences - the very beacons of rationality.  With the Enlightenment and modernism came along traditions which advocated the ideal of progress.  However, Shils argues that perhaps these traditions (while offering much good to mankind in the way of removing past prejudices and misconceptions and offering things new) have gone too far and now need to be curtailed somewhat.  Interestingly, the tradition of complete anti-traditionalism (or nihilism) is a particularly dangerous development in the history of tradition.  Nihilism brings with it decadence and a loss of meaning in society.  Philosophers such as Nietzsche and historical theorists such as Spengler wrote much about the dangers of nihilism in the earlier part of this last century.  Shils argues that he would like to see many traditions conserved; however, he does recognize the need for change in certain things.  It is a precarious balance that must be exacted between the role of strict traditionalism and the role of progress.  Nevertheless, Shils notes that the voice of tradition must be heard and all too often it is silenced in today's debates over change and progress.  Tradition may have much that is good and stable in it.  And, progress brings new dangers and instates new practices which may have similar or substantially different problems than those experienced in the traditional practices.  Thus, it is apparent that a somewhat conservative attitude must be taken with respect to progress in order to avoid some of the dangers and uncertainty which result from excessive change.  The forces of progress and those of tradition must be balanced.  Most would agree with this idea, but theprecise place where that balance is to be obtained is usually controversial (with respect to any given tradition).  Shils' book offers an excellent analysis of the role of tradition in cultures and societies and of the need for tradition in the modern world.	2003-04-06

Russia as a nation has been besieged by totalitarian governments, revolution, and communist tyranny for the last hundred years.  However, with the breakup of the old Soviet Union, a void has been created, and this void may be filled by certain political movements of the extreme right.  Tracing their origins back to the Russian Whites, the Black Hundreds, and the tsarist loyalists, modern day Russian right wing nationalists have sought to restore Russia as a nation by returning it to its historical (or mythical) past and tradition.  Many of these groups hold to certain conspiratorial beliefs involving the Antichrist and the infamous _Protocols of the Elders of Zion_ as well as certain conspiracies involving Freemasonry and the Jews (referred to as \\"Zhidomasonstvo\\", i.e. \\"Jewmasonry\\").  In addition, many on the Russian right and far right consider the Orthodox Church to be a saving force for Russia adhering to a fundamentalism which rejects other Christian beliefs especially Catholicism.  Authors such as Dostoevsky (who expressed nationalist beliefs at one time in his career) and Solzhenitsyn (who expressed nationalist beliefs and anti-communism but with more of a liberal bent) have played an important role in the development of the Russian right.  Many on the Russian right embrace pastoralism and the peasantry as opposed to industrialization, the free market, and liberalism.  Some on the far right fringe have in fact returned to paganism and rejected even Orthodox Christianity as being too tinged with Semitism.  In fact, a certain famous text (believed to be a forgery) referred to as the _Book of Vlas_ which relates tales of Russia's mythical (Aryan) past plays an important part among some on the right wing fringe.  Communism occupies a precarious position among those on the right and far right in Russia.  Some have embraced a form of nationalist Bolshevism, adhering to standards imposed by Joseph Stalin.  Others have argued for a return to monarchism or for a Cossack revival.  Among certain members of the far right in Russia, a certain hatred of all outside and alien influences (particularly but not exclusively Judaic ones) is very prevalent.  In addition, many on the right in Russia have an innate distrust of America and Americanism (some even going as far as supporting Iraq in the Gulf War).  Some on the right have attempted to incorporate ideas from certain thinkers of the \\"New Right\\" in France, such as Alain de Benoist, or even the Italian intellectual Julius Evola (who wrote the famous text _Revolt Against the Modern World_).  While Nazism is generally considered to be yet another conspiracy against the Russian people, some on the far right have embraced certain ideas of the Nazi intellectuals and have published the writings of Hitler, Goebbels, and Rosenberg in their journals.  Two of the more famous political movements among the far right in Russia include the right wing group Pamyat (meaning \\"memory\\") led by Dmitri Vasiliev, and that of the liberal-democrat party of nationalists led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  Many of these groups accuse Gorbachev and Yelstin of capitulating to alien forces (especially the Jews) and to Americanism and argue for an \\"iron hand\\" in politics, centralizing government, and the maintaining of the military and the KGB.  Some have turned towards the Orient as a promised land (hoping to incorporate features of Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Chinese thought), while others have sought their restoration in the ideologies of fascism or the \\"New Right\\" or even hope for a Cossack revival.  This book gives an excellent introduction to the right wing forces in Russia and their growth and development.  Although marred by a somewhat overly liberal bias, the author gives an excellent and thorough history and explanation of these movements which have attempted to find a satisfiable solution for the Russian people in a post-communist age.	2003-04-01

This book is the biography of the German revolutionary Wilhelm Marr.  Marr was a radical revolutionary left wing intellectual who based his philosophy on that of the Left Hegelian Ludwig Feuerbach, advocating atheism and maintaining an anti-Christian and antiSemitic belief system.  He became known as a journalist and editor of the paper _Mephistopheles_ during the nineteenth century.  He became known for his antiSemitism (and may have originated the term \\"antiSemitism\\") despite the fact that he was to have a series of Jewish wives after writing a book entitled _The Jewish Mirror_ (_Der Judenspiegel_).  He also involved himself in business deals in America where he may have participated in the slave trade and the ensuing debate over slavery.  After having met the Italian liberal nationalist intellectual and founder of the \\"Young Europe\\" movement, Giuseppe Mazzini, Marr became enamored of this individual and earned for himself the title of \\"The German Mazzini\\".  Subsequently, Marr would write another infamous antiSemitic text, _The Victory of Judaism Over Germanism_.  During this period, Marr's political alignments began to shift so that he became favored in certain reactionary circles.  Marr also became involved with the Anti-Semitic League at this time.  Later in his life after having several failed business dealings, Marr would come to criticize antiSemitism.  He argued that antiSemites were fostering an environment harmful to the poor worker in the same manner that the Jews themselves were.  At this point, Marr renounced his antiSemitism as well as his previous reactionary leanings and returned to his original revolutionary beliefs.  Marr died in relative obscurity, penniless.  However, he had made a name for himself as the instigator of antiSemitism and perhaps as the man who coined that very term.  Marr generally comes across as a rather despicable individual despite the fact that he would later come to at least partially repent of some of his antiSemitic beliefs (though never of his atheism and anti-Christian beliefs).  He played some role as a prophet who foretold the coming of the Third Reich and the horrendous evils of the twentieth century, although he would be rejected by the actual intellectuals of the Third Reich, as would the term he coined - antiSemitism.  Marr's place is among the antiSemitic left wing revolutionary intellectuals such as the musician Richard Wagner in Germany in the century before the coming of the World Wars.  This book provides a good biography of an obscure figure who played some role in predicting the coming events in the German nation in the twentieth century.  It is to be recommended despite the fact that its central figure is certainly less than savory.	2003-04-01

Donoso Cortes is famous for his reactionary beliefs concerning the French Revolution and the subsequent ideologies inspired by it and as a political prophet of the coming crises of his age.  From his beginnings as a moderate liberal intellectual and journalist in early nineteenth century Spain, Donoso turned to the traditions of the Catholic Church and came to regard his age as afflicted with a loss of center due to the denial of tradition and the established order.  Like other Catholic traditionalist counter-revolutionaries such as Joseph de Maistre and Bonald of his time, Donoso believed his age was headed for disaster in its denial of God and his rightful place among men as well as that revealed tradition of God in society so that it could only be saved through outright divine intervention.  Unlike the liberals of his time, Donoso understood man to be rooted in sin and capable of radical evil due to his fall from grace.  For Donoso, humanity would be entirely irredeemable were it not for the constraints imposed upon him from revealed tradition and the saving grace of Christ.  In fact, Donoso's prophecies concerning his age were so dark and pessimistic that many have failed to see any hope for mankind at all in them short of a direct divine intervention.  Donoso served as both a journalist and friend to the Queen Maria Cristina of Spain as well as a diplomat to both Berlin and Prussia and later to France.  He had various relationships with certain central political figures of his time including the emperor Napoleon III as well as the pope.  Donoso predicted the coming bloodshed in Europe, the nationalist and socialist revolutions in the next century, as well as making predictions for an innate saving power residing in the people and traditions of Russia and its civilization.  It is the importance of these darkened predictions to the modern age that have made Donoso a figure who was revived in more recent times by various conservative political writers, among them the jurist and Third Reich intellectual Carl Schmitt.  Donoso's early writings were written from the perspective of a moderate liberal and emphasized the role of intellect in political affairs.  Later Donoso would take a sharper turn towards reaction rejecting the ideals of the revolution, and in his most famous work _Catholicism, Liberalism, and Socialism_ would outline the major differences between these political ideologies.  For Donoso, liberalism represented a sliding point between the traditional order which consisted of the Catholic Church and the monarchy and the extremes of socialism and nihlism.  Donoso respected socialism for having its own \\"demonic theology\\" and admired (though he sharply criticized) the famous anarchist philosopher Joseph Proudhon.  Donoso observed the move away from God through pantheism (represented by democracy which deified the masses) towards His outright denial in atheism and nihlism.  Donoso remarked frequently about the dangers of excessive discussion and parliamentarianism and the loss of the role of authority.  The author, R. A. Herrara, contends that Donoso served as a Cassandra for his age, a prophet whose dark interpretations were doomed to be ignored in his time, but whose revelations demonstrated profound truths.  This book provides an excellent biography of a lonely figure who stood for tradition and the authority of Catholicism in a time of crisis - a Catholic traditionalist and a dark prophet for his time.	2003-03-30

The book traces the developments in his thoughts from his earliest days as a Catholic schoolchild in the Rhineland to his eventual professorship in constitutional law and his involvement with the Third Reich regime and the subsequent developments in his thought after the Third Reich had fallen.  Schmitt is normally considered to belong with the \\"conservative revolutionaries\\" such as Ernst Junger, Oswald Spengler, Martin Heidegger, and several other important figures in the Weimar republic prior to the advent of the Third Reich.  These thinkers were important for their political and philosophical thought which was firmly opposed to liberalism, bolshevism, and modernism.  An important aspect behind Schmitt's thought was his Catholicism (however tenuous that link may have become for him at various moments in his life).  Certain interpreters of Schmitt have made the claim that Schmitt's writings can be understood on the basis of a \\"fundamentalist\\" Catholicism , in which the crisis in the modern world is perceived in apocalyptic terms involving an encounter between Christ and Antichrist.  Schmitt became a jurist and a professor of constitutional law and a great deal of his writing is concerned with the application of his political principles to the legal status of the constitution.  Schmitt's thinking is heavily influenced by the German Romantics such as Schlegel and Hegelianism, but also has a Latin character influenced by such Catholic counter-revolutionaries as Joseph de Maistre and Donoso Cortes, as well as the writings of Thomas Hobbes in his _Leviathan_, and the writings of Machiavelli.  Perhaps Schmitt is most famous for his understanding of the political in terms of the \\"friend-enemy\\" distinction.  He outlined this distinction in his famous work _The Concept of the Political_.  Schmitt came to occupy a central place inthe Third Reich regime and was often regarded as the \\"Crown Jurist\\" of that regime.  The particular problematic of Schmitt's involvement with the Third Reich and his adherence to certain anti-Semitic beliefs is firmly covered in this book.  After the defeat of the Third Reich, Schmitt would come to partially renounce some of his earlier alignment with it; however, he would also come to regard the process of denazification which involved him spending several years in captivity as equally abominable.  Much of Schmitt's work focused on a particular interpretation of Thomas Hobbes in hiw book _Leviathan_.  Schmitt may have believed in an apocalyptic myth involving an obscure quasi-Messianic figure, the Katechon (see the discussion in the book; but also see Paul's epistle to the Thessalonians where it is explained that the Katechon refers to a \\"restrainer\\" who is to come).  The book also discusses Schmitt's relationship with the new international order subsequent to the Nazi regime.  The importance of Schmitt's thought here in regards to our modern era which is closely coming to approximate a New World Order and a system of international law based in the United Nations (i.e. the League of Nations in Schmitt's time) cannot be overestimated.  Schmitt's later works include a book entitled _Land and Sea_ which outlines the differences between land and sea powers and a work entitled _The Law of the Earth_.  The relationship between a landlocked continental German power and a seafaring English power rooted in the Calvinistic religion plays an important role in Schmitt's writings.  Schmitt's later days were spent in relative obscurity as a figure who was considered anathema by the new intellectuals; however, he continued to write and work and gather a group of students around him.  Carl Schmitt is a fascinating figure who encountered the dark side and whose thinking still poses interesting questions for the modern world.  His distinction between friend and enemy continues to occupy an important place in the role of political theory and although some on the Left have attempted to usurp his ideas, his ideas remain firmly grounded in the tradition of right wing intellectuals of the conservative revolution.  This book provides an excellent introduction and outline of his life and thought and is to be highly recommended to all those interested in this figure.	2003-03-01

The first half of the book is devoted to a detailed background survey of the mystical roots of Christianity, and the second half of the book is devoted to the analysis and application of these ideas to the icons themselves.  Fully rooted in the perennial philosophy, Richard Temple, the author, attempts to outline the mystical developments as they arose in Egypt, Greece, and in the earliest beginnings of Christianity.  The author includes a detailed account of the philosophies of the ancient Egyptians, Pythagoras, the cult of Orpheus, the Platonists, and Philo of Alexandria.  Involved in this survey are the esoteric ideas of Plato and the NeoPlatonists (particularly Plotinus, Philo of Alexandria from the Jewish perspective, and Origen from the Christian perspective).  The early church father, Origen would come later to propose a fourfold interpretation of the sacred biblical texts, which some would regard as heretical (although it would be revived in modern times).  Temple also considers the early heretical movement of Gnosticism, which claimed to offer esoteric knowledge of God and often involved elaborate mystical cosmogonies.  The early church fathers would come to write against Gnosticism in the most severe manner due to the potential dangers lurking in this belief system.  Temple includes a discussion of certain practices in the Eastern churches including the Hesychasm and the text used in the Eastern Church, _The Philokalia_, a presentation of the wisdom and practical mystical advice of the monks from Mount Athos throughout the centuries.  Temple also includes discussions of the early Platonist, Plotinus, and his role in the philosophical underpinnings of mystical thought as well as the Christian Platonist, Dionysius the Areopagite, who developed a negativetheology in his writings.  The second section of this book turns to the discussion of the sacred art in icons proper.  Here, the author examines icons through the Fayum portraits and the Sinai Christ and Mother of God.  These earliest scenes paved the way for the future artworks which were to come to represent the icons.  In particular, the Alexandrian, Cosmas Indicopleustes, explained the origin of the Divine Ray and the Platonic hierarchies as they applied to the Great Chain of Being in the development of the icons.  The author examines the role of the Orpheus cult and alludes to Jesus Christ's descent into hell before his resurrection to explain the divine mysteries of certain icons.  The author also examines icons revealing Saint George and the dragon, and he shows how these particular icons represent spiritual mastery over lower urges (expressed through the figures of the dragon and the white stead).  A distinction is drawn between the inner and the outer levels of man.  Thus, various biblical events involve both an exoteric and an esoteric interpretation (e.g. those within the ark of Noah represent the esoteric circle while those outside the ark represent the exoteric aspect).  The role of the topographical background to the icon and the divine light emanating from the heavens is explained by the author, including a discussion of the Christ Pantocrater.  The author concludes with a discussion of Mary, the Theotokos (the \\"God-bearer\\", the Mother of God) and the iconostasis - the screen that separates the nave from the sanctuary in Eastern churches which involves several tiers of icons.  Displayed on the iconostasis are the various biblical scenes from the lives of Jesus and Mary (the life of Jesus being contained within the life of Mary) which illustrate various aspects of the divine unfolding.  This illustrates the ancient principle of unity in multiplicity.  The author concludes the book with a discussion of the need for a return to perennial philosophy as an explanation for the icons.  In general, icons have played a far greater role in the Eastern churches than in those of the West.  Furthermore, the author contends that mysticism has played a more important role in the East than in the West.  While icons have been variously condemned and then allowed to proliferate, their role in the earliest developments of Christianity and Christian mysticism is apparent.  This book offers not only a useful introduction to icons, but also an introduction to the perennial philosophy that underlies their interpretation.  For those seekers after truth who choose to disregard the materialistic drift of modern times, a return to the most ancient forms of Christianity and Christian practice and a revival of its true mystical nature is of the most life-fulfilling importance.	2003-02-17

The book outlines in great detail the implementation of communistic regimes in Russia, Eastern Europe, China, Southeast Asia, and South America, and the bloodshed, terror, and atrocity that inevitably results.  In total, the ideology developed by the German \\"Left Hegelian\\" philosopher Karl Marx, has resulted in over 200,000,000 deaths as well as a great deal of political and economic damage to the countries in which it has been implemented.  The mere 25 million killed by the other totalitarian regime of the twentieth century - Nazism - pales in comparison.  This is to say nothing of the secret collaboration between Stalinism and Nazism during and after the Second World War.  Through its implementation in Russia and China, communism resulted in mass famine, unemployment, economic breakdown, and totalitarian rule where citizens lived in constant fear of the secret police or of being carried off in the night to work in the gulags.  In 1931, Pope Pius XI warned the world about the dangers of communism in his encyclical _Quadragesimo anno_.  He writes:  \\"Communism teaches and seeks two objectives:  unrelenting class warfare and the complete eradication of private ownership.  Not secretly or by hidden methods does it do this, but publicly, openly, and by employing any means possible, even the most violent.  To achieve these objectives, there is nothing it is afraid to do, nothing for which it has respect or reverence.  When it comes to power, it is ferocious in its cruelty and inhumanity.  The horrible slaughter and destruction through which it laid to waste vast regions of Eastern Europe and Asia give evidence of this.\\"  Why such an ideology would continue to draw support from many of those on the Left who claim to advocate ideals of equality and fraternity, but especially of liberty, is beyond comprehension.  Wherever it attacks, communism leaves a trail of blood and economic destruction.  While the Soviet Union has collapsed, the United States continues to face the threat of communism in the form of the Chinese regime, North Korea, and various Southeast Asian and South American countries to this very day.  Certainly those concerned for human rights and liberties in the world must recognize the great evil that is perpetuated through this pernicious philosophy.  The Red Menace continues to threaten all bastions of freedom and hope in the world to this day.  This book is well written and thoroughly documented and it is a must read for all those concerned about the future of humanity, the modern state, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the modern world.quality and fraternity, but especially of liberty, is beyond comprehension.

Continuing along the same lines as he had in his more famous _Revolt Against the Modern World_, Evola advocates a return to Tradition and radical counter-revolution.  This translation is divided into three parts:  an excellent introduction to the life and thought of Julius Evola, the text of _Men Among the Ruins_ proper, and Julius Evola's defense when brought in front of a court for charges of subversive activity.<br />_Men Among the Ruins_ has been called a \\"dangerous book\\" and Evola has been called a fascist; however, if we are unable to read these \\"dangerous books\\" and decide for ourselves what they have to say then we will never be able to learn anything from outside of the dull conformist mainstream.  The introduction to this book explains much of Evola's thought and life, while at the same time explaining the particularly tricky issues of his involvement with fascism, his lectures in Germany, his racist theories (unlike the crass biological racism of certain components of the National Socialist regime, Evola advocates a spiritual notion of race), and his relationship with antiSemitism (including mention of the notorious forgery \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\").<br />_Men Among the Ruins_ advocates a return to Tradition and a rejection of modern day liberalism, Bolshevism, individualism, collectivism, and the ideals of the revolution.  Against this, Evola proposes a return to an underlying Indo-European substratum, authority, and a re-recognition of the necessity for transcendence.  The book includes discussions of various aspects of the State, hierarchy, work and the economy, the Roman Imperium, corporativism (which Evola will somewhat reject along with socialism), militarism, and the role of war.  Evola also tackles the issues of the \\"occult war\\" (including many of the rumors about the Jews - Evola rejects the more virulent forms of antiSemitism), the \\"problem of births\\", and Roman Catholicism as a component of that Tradition.  I disagree somewhat with Evola's rejection of Catholicism, although it is unclear to me how much of this aspect of the Tradition is retainable (this would include recognition of the changes in the Church post-Vatican II, as well as the need to address the problem Evola brings up of the world's other religious traditions within the framework of Catholicism).  Evola concludes with a discussion of the united Europe and a call for a new European Order.  Evola writes specifically about the kind of men that are needed to compose this new Order, including old European families and military leaders.  He concludes, \\"It remains to be seen which and how many men, in spite of it all, still stand upright among so many ruins, in order that they may make this task their own.\\"  The book concludes with Evola's defense before the Italian court and his rejection of his specific \\"glorification of Fascism\\" charge.  This defense is one of the best clarifications of Evola's personal idiosyncratic thought that I have encountered.<br />In order to read this work, it is probably necessary to first complete Evola's more famous _Revolt Against the Modern World_.  Most of Evola's other works that have been translated have a more esoteric bent to them and are less outrightly political.  In the end however, Evola advocates a form of apoleteia, a phenomenon he will refer to as \\"riding the tiger\\", and a rejection of all party politics.  In fact, Evola never participated in outright politics nor ever voted in his entire life.  The book goes beyond the familiar schema of Right and Left political thinking and is certainly not to be recommended to any person completely absorbed in either mainstream or modernist ideologies and modes of thinking.	2003-02-15

Evola traces the origins of Guenon's ideas and his views against modernity through his life and work.

Rev. Denis Fahey contends that the modern world is headed in the direction of greater servility, communism, and \\"naturalistic\\" supplantation of true religion.  Opposed to this tendency stands the great tradition of Christ's Catholic Church.  The author examines some dictatorships such as Hitler's Germany which attempted to oppose international finance based on a false religion of racial worship.  Against this the author proposes that we must return to the mystical Body of Christ in an effort to achieve a truly Christian society.  This essay is also interesting for its discussions of banking, the gold standard, and the role of international finance and racial idolatry in the affairs of the modern world.	2003-02-09

The modern world is besieged by a crass materialism which emphasizes scientism and denies the traditional outlook of the world's religions.  Postmodernity has brought new philosophies which deny absolute truth and objective reality while at the same time offering New Age spiritualities which lead man away from God.  Firmly grounded in the Traditionalist school of such writers as Rene Guenon, Ananda Coomaraswamy, and Frithjof Schuon and basing his critique on the perennial philosophy and the idea of the Transcendent Unity of Religions, Charles Upton attempts to show that both postmodernity and the New Age are likely to lead man astray and are a sign of nihilistic decadence which may be heralding in the coming of Antichrist.  According to Charles Upton, both postmodernity and the New Age movement consist of spiritualities which are fitted for the coming globalism.  Opposing globalism are various revolutionary and reactionary tribalist groups which attempt to assert their own identity against the conformity demanded by the New World Order.  It is this crisis in the modern world that is likely to bring about the Age of Antichrist.  Charles Upton contends that a return to the traditional outlook, perennialist metaphysics, and the world's great religious traditions is necessary if we hope to survive the coming tribulation and our own modern nihilistic culture.  Much of this book is spent critiquing various systems of New Age thought.  Thus, there are to be found critiques of the spiritual systems of Jane Roberts and her \\"Seth\\" material, the Native magician Carlos Castenada, the neo-Gnosticism of _A Course in Miracles_, the philosophy of _The Celestine Prophecy_, and the entrepreneurial Hinduism of Depak Chopra.  In particular, Charles Upton shows how each of these systems conflicts with the traditional metaphysics and religious orthodoxy and thus falls into error.  Upton proceeds to show how the New Age movement is actually a reflection of the shadow of God and how each individual must address the problem of evil.  In addition, various aspects of the New Age movement are particularly disturbing because they seek to either deny or rebel against the idea of love - as traditionally understood.  Charles Upton provides a unique interpretation of the modern phenomenon of UFOs.  To Upton, UFO sightings and alien abductions constitute a particularly disturbing aspect of the postmodern world.  Upton contends that perhaps we can understand these aliens as spiritual beings, the jinn of Islamic folklore or the demons of Christian tradition.  Upton notes that not all of these entities may be evil or necessarily harmful; however, since without a traditional understanding it is impossible to determine this, they should be avoided.  This is similar to the manner in which Upton understands the phenomenon of channeling and discarnate spirits (in which he references the work of Rene Guenon in particular on this subject).  Next, Upton proceeds to refute the thesis put forward in the popular exposition of the Traditionalist school, _The Only Tradition_ by William Quinn.  According to Upton, this book attempts to reconcile two disparate forms of thought, that of the Traditionalist school and that of the Theosophical Society founded by Madame H. P. Blavatsky.  Rene Guenon himself had written a distinct book refuting the ideas of Blavatsky.  The best and most fulfilling chapters in this book are the last two focusing on Comparative Eschatology and Facing Apocalypse, respectively.  Upton offers a unique comparative eschatology in which he focuses on the eschatological traditions in the world's religions, including Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, the religions of the Hopi and Lakota American Indians, Tibetan Buddhism in particular, and Hinduism.  Upton is particularly strong in focusing on the relationships between Christian eschatology (particularly that of the Eastern Orthodox Church)and Islam and their own unique understandings of the Antichrist (al-Dajjal to the Muslims), the Mahdi, and the person of Jesus Christ.  Contrary to much of the nonsense that has been offered up in the eschatological fields in recent times particularly by fundamentalist Protestants, the eschatological theories of Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism entail a much higher level of understanding.  Many individuals from different religious persuasions believe that the Antichrist will likely be a unique individual who appears during a time of crisis.  Rene Guenon himself believed that the Antichrist would likely be a specific individual.  While Upton remains noncommittal as to whether the Antichrist will be an incarnate individual or simply a powerful force, he does show that his reign is to come upon us and is signified by the crisis of the modern world.  Particularly of interest is Upton's understanding of the person of Jesus Christ; he notes that Jesus may have sympathized with the revolutionary forces of his time, the equivalents of modern day tribalism and nationalism, but that his own philosophy did not entail revolution (\\"Render to Caesar what is Caesar's\\").  Interestingly, Upton contends that it is out of these two distinct forces that the tribulation and the reign of Antichrist will come.  Also interesting is Upton's unique understanding of and warning about shamanism.  While Upton contends that there may be many primordial traditions that have retained an intact form of shamanism, he argues that this late in the cosmic cycle any attempt to revive this religious form is likely to be potentially dangerous.  It is prophesied that the Antichrist will be a great deceiver and that he will usher in a new era and will be a political and religious problem solver.  However, his ultimate goals will appeal to ourown spiritual pride.  While the modern age remains in a time of crisis, the Traditionalist philosophy and the foundation of the world's religions offer mankind a sign of hope.  By overcoming our own pride and turning towards God, man will be able to survive the vicissitudes of the modern world and the coming reign of Antichrist.	2003-01-25

Hoffman II is a rambling account of some of the mysterious influences behind public events in the twentieth century and the occult significance of many different mass murders.  Michael A. Hoffman II claims that through decoding the \\"establishment's\\" form of masonic twilight language, he can understand the occult significance of many dates and events.  In particular, Hoffman reveals that alchemical principles underly the historic events of the atomic bomb detonation, the Kennedy assassination, and the moon landing.  Also dealt with are the masonic influence in the \\"ritual killings\\" of the mass murderers Jack the Ripper, the Son of Sam, Ted Kaczynski, and the Oklahoma City bombing.  Hoffman contends that these killers may have been raised since birth (as a sort of Rosemary's baby) to perform their dark deeds along with their secret occult brotherhoods.  Hoffman also examines the Kabbalistic creation of the golem (the humonculous, the mannikin, the \\"artificial man\\"), the alchemical transformation of matter into energy via the atomic bomb explosion, the growing influence of a black market in human organs, the mysterious policies of the Vatican and the Jews, and the dark secrets of O.T.O. initiate Jack Parsons.  Hoffman's views are thoroughly anti-establishment, Luddite, libertarian, and traditionalist.  He advocates a return to the true principles of Christianity, a rejection of the modern world and its Judaic influence, and an assault on the lies preached by the freemasonic and Illuminati establishment cabal.  The book concludes with a mysterious reference to Hoffman's favorite pet beast \\"Wicked King Wicker\\", which appears to refer to the ability to \\"bend reality\\".  It is by bending reality that the establishment \\"Cryptocracy\\" has been able to infiltrate the minds of so many innocents.  The book certainly is one of the most strange and interesting I have ever read.  Hoffman's theories while bizarre and esotericcertainly merit consideration by any individual who is open to influences outside of the mainstream.  Hoffman and his fellow scholar James Shelby Downard are unique among conspiracy researchers for their ability to uncover hidden connections through the understanding of the \\"twilight language\\" of the dominant Cryptocracy.  You certainly will not find another book like this and you certainly will enjoy Hoffman's rambling, though often bizarre, philosophical bent on the issues that concern us in the modern world.	2003-01-25

Ever popular among occultists, antiSemites, fringe politicals, NeoNazis, and conspiracy theorists, the infamous \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" have an intriguing history.  Norman Cohn begins by tracing the idea of Jewish world conspiracy to early nominally Christian apocalyptic movements.  To the orthodox Christian, apocalypticism represents a heretical movement which seeks to give rise to the Kingdom of God on Earth.  During the French Revolution, rumors abounded concerning mysterious groups of \\"Illuminati\\" initiates and Freemasonic cults.  The French Jesuit, Abbe Barruel, wrote about his experiences with the Illuminati, and the Freemasonic lodges were blame for the terror of the French Revolution.  Basing their philosophy on Enlightenment principles and rejecting the authority of tradition, the monarchy, and the Catholic Church, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were notorious for their role in instigating subversion.  It was against this background of paranoia that various antiSemitic pamphlets began to circulate many of which attempted to link the Jews with the Freemasons in a plot for world conquest.  For instance, mysterious letters from various rabbis were produced which claimed that the Jews should infiltrate Christian European society so as to further their own schemes for world domination.  Traditionally seen as an agent of Satan, the Jews were an easy target for various antiSemitic European individuals who often concocted such \\"letters\\" as a joke.  It was amidst this environment of antiSemitism and hostility towards Jews and Freemasons that the \\"Protocols\\" document was forged.  Between 1903 and 1907, the \\"Protocols\\" document circulated among the Russian intelligentsia and among the Russian press.  In his book _The Great in the Small, the occultist Sergey Nilus provided his theories on the Jewish conspiracy and the imminent arrival of Antichrist as well as including a copy of the \\"Protocols\\".  Norman Cohn explains how the \\"Protocols\\" document is a historical forgery which may have been based on the text of _Dialogue aux Enfers entre Montesquieu et Machiavel_ by the French lawyer Maurice Joli.  The \\"Protocols\\" basically outline a plan for Jewish infiltration of Christian society and eventual take-over based upon the philosophy that \\"Might is Right\\".  Cohn then proceeds to outline how the Russian tsarist secret police, the Okrhana, developed an interest in the \\"Protocols\\" and explains the rise of a pre-fascist movement, the Black Hundreds, in Russia.  Interestingly, the swastika symbol was used among initiates in the Black Hundreds movement as a symbol of opposition to Jews.  When the Tsar and Tsaritsa were found dead, a copy of the book _The Great in the Small_ and a drawing of the swastika symbol was found among the Tsaritsa's personal effects.  Instances such as these led to many populist uprisings.  In the showdown between the Russian \\"Whites\\" (loyalists to the tsar and the empire) and the Bolsheviks in the Russian revolution, the \\"Protocols\\" played an important role among the reactionary Whites.  Cohn then proceeds to show how the \\"Protocols\\" reached Germany and eventually made their way around the world.  Propagated by such individuals as Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi theorist and writer of the book _The Myth of the Twentieth Century_, during the Nazi era, the \\"Protocols\\" played an important part in the ideology of the Nazis and were used by Hitler in his schemes for constructing the Third Reich.  Other individuals associated with the \\"Protocols\\" or antiSemitism including the American industrialist Henry Ford, who wrote the notorious book popular among Nazis _The International Jew_ (although he later would repent of his antiSemitism), and the Depression era Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin.  Norman Cohn's book provides an interesting history of the various subversive movements which used the \\"Protocols\\" to further their own brand of hatred.  Also, the book is interesting for its understanding of the phenomenon of antiSemitism.  Norman Cohn includes a chapter in which he analyzes the role of paranoia and antiSemitism in the mental instabilities of different individuals and entire cultures.  Antisemitism may indeed be a form of psychological aberration.  In today's world, the \\"Protocols\\" have again by ressurrected by different occult and conspiracy groups as well as NeoNazis and Islamic extremists seeking to justify their terroristic activities.  Whatever the \\"Protocols\\" may indicate about the nature of the human animal, it is most likely something very sinister and disturbing.  This is a good book which might provide an understanding and a bridge towards development away from antiSemitism.<br />Also recommended:  Nicholas Goodrick-Clark and Hannah Arendt's _The Origins of Totalitarianism_.	2003-01-10

Peter Levenda's _Unholy Alliance_ is at once a tale of adventure and intrigue and a useful source of information on the occult origins of Nazism.  Much has been made of these occult beginnings and developments which led to the creation of Hitler's Third Reich and which have continued after its downfall in various forms of NeoNazism.  In this book, Peter Levenda examines these occult aspects of Nazism from its early development in the Thule Society and among individuals such as Guido von List, Lanz von Liebenfels, and Rudolf von Sebottendorf to Nazi psychics up until the present day in which Satanism and other such dark forces have combined with Nazi occultism.  Levenda rightly contends that Hitler himself was not overly influenced by occult ideas (contrary to the thesis put forth in _The Spear of Destiny_) despite his youthful readings of von Liebenfel's notorious magazine, \\"Ostara\\".  However, according to Levenda the magical and occult aspects of Nazism cannot be denied.  Levenda considers Nazism to be a sort of cult with an all powerful leader (\\"Der Fuehrer\\").  Much of the material in this book as far as the early roots of Nazism is available from other sources especially _The Occult Roots of Nazism_ by Nicholas Goodrick-Clark.  However, Levenda provides new material in his examination of Nazi psychics, including Hanussen, his thorough discussion of the Ahnenerbe Society, his explanation of the Tibet expedition which has not previously been covered by other authors in this field, and his discussions of the notorious madman Aleister Crowley.  In fact, a great deal of this book focuses on the shenanigans of Aleister Crowley but also discusses the roots of many German secret societies in the Theosophical Society of the medium Madame H. P. Blavatsky.  The most interesting discussion in this book however is that of the survival of the Nazi cult in various manifestations particularly in South America.  The far reaches of the tentacles of the Nazi octopus can be seen inthe trail of Rudolf Hess, where he claims that he was being mind-controlled by various psychiatrists working for the Allied Powers.  This is one among hundreds of bizarre instances involving the captured Nazi elite.  The escaped Nazis may have traveled to South America via various underground channels.  Individuals such as Klaus Barbie and Martin Bormann as well as the infamous physician, Dr. Josef Mengele, may have traveled to South America and survived in hiding under different aliases and involving themselves with various occult movements and lodges.  The nation of Chile appears to be particularly likely to be infested with NeoNazis according to Levenda.  Among others the occult writer and Chilean diplomat Miguel Serrano has written praising Hitler.  Levenda himself investigated the secret Nazi center, the infamous \\"Colonia Dignidad\\", in Chile.  This mysterious colony is run by the self-described \\"Baptist\\" zealot, Dr. Ernst Schafer, with unproven ties to Nazism.  While in Chile, Levenda encountered this mysterious Nazi colony and barely managed to escape alive (luckily a report involving the statute of limitations on Nazi war crimes was being reviewed that day which may have allowed his escape).  Rumors of mysterious deaths, torture, sexual abuse of children, and the practice of the black arts combining traditional Voodoo ritual with Nazi occultism have spread about the infamous \\"Colonia Dignidad\\".  Whatever exactly this colony consists of, it is certainly not a wholesome affair.  In the last full chapter in this book, Levenda turns his attention to NeoNazism.  In particular, he examines the question of Nazi Satanism (taking a look at such organizations as the former National Renaissance Party) as well as the phenomenon of Nazi Skinheads.  Nazi Satanists appear to base their rites off of those performed by the ultimate black magician and Reichsfuehrer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, which he performed in his mysterious castle, Wewelsburg.  Levenda makes some decentcomparisons and analysis of Nazism and the Satanic abduction scare (in which he compares such mass murderers as Charles Manson with Nazi occultism and Satanic practices).  Ultimately, upon finishing this book, it is clear to the reader that the Nazis were indeed based on an occult system of practice.  While I dislike the idea that this was some form of neopaganism, it is more likely a restoration of the Gnostic heresy and a revolt against the Catholic Church, Christianity, and the Semitic religions.  Levenda is unfortunately too harsh on the Catholic Church in this respect giving into many modernist and liberal biases.  It is a fact that the Church tried to protect many individuals from the evils of Nazism and its death camps, despite whatever else certain of its members may have done.  Also, the case against Pope Pius XII's involvement with Nazism is certainly far from being resolved in my mind at least.  I believe Nazism constitutes a form of modern day Satanism and its ties to black magic and evil forms of occultism and degeneracy are all too apparent.<br />Also recommended:  _The Morning of the Magicians_ by Pauwels and Bergier and _The Occult Roots of Nazism_ by Nicholas Goodrick-Clark.	2003-01-09

Griffin attempts to provide a definition for the essence of a series of movements and political regimes which were given rise to in the earlier part of this last century and which he believes constitute \\"fascism\\".  The term fascism has fallen into much abuse and misuse in modern times, and it has become a part of our common linguistic currency used to define or demolish any movement which appears to have totalitarian or authoritarian underpinnings or which is overly oppressive.  For instance, Marxist historians are especially prone to label as fascist any movement which is contrary to their own particular political ideology of history as class struggle.  (This is particularly ironic because Marxism itself appears to be an extremely violent and oppressive ideology, not all that dissimilar from the ideologies of Mussolini or Hitler, in a word - fascist.)  Griffin contends that there is such a thing as \\"generic fascism\\" of which the National Socialism of Hitler's Germany (Nazism) and the Fascism of Mussolini's Italy are two particular instances of.  Griffin defines this generic fascism as:  \\"Fascism is a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism.  (p. 26)\\".  Thus, fascism is a utopian revolutionary ideology which attempts to revive a form of ultra-nationalism - represented frequently by the myth of the phoenix, the mythical bird which arises new each day from its own ashes.  Griffin argues against Eric Voegelin's thesis that fascism (particularly National Socialism) is a form of political religion, a revival of the Gnostic heresy with roots in the apocalyptic tradition represented by the medieval monastic Joachim of Fiore.  (Here, I disagree slightly with Griffin's somewhat overly simplistic rejection of Voegelin.  Voegelin is famous for saying that one must avoid the \\"immanentization of the eschaton\\", the attempt to create the Kingdom of God on Earth.)  Once Griffin has succeeded in defining generic fascism to his satisfaction, he then goes on to explore the various political movements and regimes which are instances of it or which bear a resemblance to his definition but which fail to fulfill all of its requirements.  First, Griffin discusses Italian Fascism, beginning with the proto-fascism (not fully fascist) in Italy before the rise of Benito Mussolini.  The Italian proto-fascism arose out of various movements of Italian interventionists who combined with certain aspects of neo-syndicalism (whose principal expositor is that of Georges Sorel).  Individuals such as D'Annunzio, Papini, and the Futurist movement in the arts led by Marinetti, combined under Mussolini to form the fascist movement in Italy.  Griffin then discusses various aspects of Italian Fascism once it had come to full development in a totalitarian dictatorship under Mussolini, and also examines the various forms of postwar fascism in Italy.  Next, Griffin turns his attention towards German Fascism (represented by National Socialism).  In Germany, various forms of proto-fascism existed which finally completed itself in the fully fascist Third Reich regime under Adolf Hitler.  Conservative revolutionaries, reactionary modernists, Volkish ideologues, and various proto-Nazi occultists were combined into a movement that gave rise to German National Socialism (Nazism).  Griffin discusses the development of Nazism under Hitler and its completion in the demise of the Third Reich and the subsequent death of Hitler.  Next, Griffin examines what he terms \\"abortive inter-war fascisms\\".  These are various attempts to create a fascist movement in European nations (particularly those occupied by the Nazis).  Griffin contends that fascist forces were always marginalized before they had the chance to come to full power.  These movements include various \\"para-fascisms\\" (attempts to create amovement with the external trappings of fascism) among which are Vichy France and Franco's Spain (which was strongly reactionary but not truly and fully fascist).  Finally, Griffin turns to non-European and postwar fascisms.  These include regimes in South Africa (based on racialism) and Japan, which Griffin contends failed to become truly fascist.  Griffin also examines mimetic forms of fascism (including NeoNazism) and various movements which are to be considered ultra-Right or conservative revolutionary.  The book concludes with discussions on the psycho-historical bases of fascism (including examinations of myth and focusing on the theories of Arthur Koestler) and the socio-political determinants of fascism's success (which attempts to show why modern fascist movements have failed and been increasingly marginalized).  I believe Griffin goes too far in labeling certain \\"New Right\\" intellectuals such as Alain de Benoist or Julius Evola with the fascist label.  This label has been conveniently used by liberals to discredit different right wing thinkers who call for a \\"return to tradition\\" and a \\"renewal of the West\\".  Also, I believe the most dangerous form of fascism in the modern world comes not from nationalist groups but from the global democratic elite themselves.  In an era in which global hegemony is being concentrated into the hands of an ever decreasing in size select group of globalist profiteering elite, it is apparent that a new form of \\"fascism\\" is arriving upon us in the form of a New World Order.  By itself, palingenetic movements are not necessarily to be avoided.  It may be that a certain type of palingenetic movement is the only one possible to assure our survival of the viscitudes of modernity.	2003-01-08

Books	4	6	12	N	N	What Is History?	_Denying History_ asks the reader the fundamental question of what exactly constitutes history by examining the claims of individuals who attempt to disprove or deny various historical aspects of the Holocaust.  Contrary to the popular postmodern view that all historical views are equally valid in some sense, this book contends that there is an objective science to history and that only certain views can be properly called historical.  The authors attempt to prove this assertion by examining the \\"pseudo-histories\\" proposed by various individuals with ties to NeoNazi organizations which attempt to disprove or deny various aspects of the Holocaust.  The authors also attempt to show that the Holocaust did indeed occur based on a \\"convergence of evidence\\".  That is to say, that various streams of evidence all point in the same direction towards the likelihood of the Holocaust actually having occurred.  Much of the book is spent examining the beliefs of various individuals who the authors term \\"Holocaust deniers\\".  (The authors make a distinction between mere \\"revisionists\\" who attempt to update historical works based on improved data and newly available documents, and \\"deniers\\" who simply deny a historical claim based on an ideological dogma.)  These include mostly individuals who publish articles in an obscure journal, the \\"Journal of Historical Review\\".  Based on a statistical analysis of the articles published in this journal, the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to call the \\"Journal of Historical Review\\", the \\"Journal of Holocaust Denial\\".  The authors the refute various claims made by the Holocaust deniers about certain aspects of the Holocaust and then attempt to prove through various historical documents and eyewitness accounts as well as photographic evidence that a convergence of evidence leads towards the near certainty that the Holocaust did occur.  Despite claims to the contrary, Holocaust deniers are almost uniformly historical mavericks who have proclivities towards either the radical far Left or the radical far Right extreme.  Thus, the popular far Left theoretician Noam Chomsky can write a preface to the work of the far Right Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson.  Holocaust denial thus appears to be where both extremes meet.  (Interestingly the authors attempt to show that claims of \\"moral equivalence\\" which would exonerate the Nazis or Axis powers and/or make the United States or Allies morally culpable for the bloodshed of World War II or the Holocaust are another attempt at denial.)  Surprisingly, one of the popular Holocaust deniers is Jewish, David Cole, a man who appears to have had a natural proclivity towards extremism and obscure political movements.  Furthermore, David Cole appears to have been harassed by another extremist organization, the Jewish Defense League, which seems to have caused him to repent and change his beliefs and then retire into obscurity.  Another Holocaust denier is the English historian David Irving.  Irving's works appear to have some historical value for his own unique understanding of Nazism, despite his obvious lack of credibility due to his form of denial.  The authors conclude with an examination of some of the problems posed by historical denial in its various forms.  I am glad that the authors included a discussion of the \\"Rape of Nanking\\", which has been repeatedly denied by certain Japanese individuals despite its barbarity.  Also, I am glad that the authors included some of the (ridiculous!) \\"Afrocentrist\\" literature as being a form of denial.  This shows that a lot of denial actually is taking place among individuals firmly planted in academic posts.  With the continuing growth of a nihilistic postmodern academic culture (mostly with posts filled by a hierarchy of burnt out radicals left over from the Sixties), it is important to address the various forms of denial their views have taken.  I am however disappointed that this book only addresses the issue ofthe Holocaust for Jews.  In any discussion of Nazi attrocities, the slaughter of the Gypsies, the mentally deficient, and various other races and religious groups is almost uniformly left out in what is largely an entirely pro-Jewish discussion of Nazi attrocities.  While I cannot agree with much of what the Skeptical Society claims to offer (given that they appear to be largely very closed-minded individuals of little imagination and not very skeptical at that), I did however find this book valuable as a discussion of historical method.	2003-01-04

For it's informational content, this book likely merits five stars because it outlines in a succinct space much of the secret society and subversive literature that exists.  However, for David Icke's screwball philosophy, his belief in non-existent aliens, his Holocaust denial, and his support of Islamic extremists and Arab terrorists, I have had to denigrate this book down to the two star level.  Basically, this book reads as a Who's Who list of the major movers and shakers within the world of international relations.  We've known for a long time that they start many of the wars just to fund the opposing side.  We've known for a long time that the Illuminati have repeatedly tried to infiltrate the Vatican and usurp the primacy of the Pope.  We've known that the Vatican is under constant attack from the devilish combination of Freemasonry and Modernism.  We've known that the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers run the world through the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Federal Reserve banking system.  This information presented in this book is helpful to the general reader.  However, one should take caution with this work.  Icke is a screwball of the highest order.  He believes in aliens, is likely a Satanist, hates Christianity, and supports Arab terrorists.  In sum, I can say that although much here is of interest to the general reader, that it must be approached with extreme caution.  There are evil and sinister forces out there which will try to ensnare naive minds in their dubious plots for world domination and mind control.  And, despite his claims to represent those forces of light and goodness, Icke is obviously not who he claims to be.  Watch out, because there is indeed a constant war between the forces of light and those of darkness going on.

To the European reader, however, this book offers very little aside from the comments on the various hoaxes and shams used by the Holocaust Industry.  The book focuses almost entirely on the infighting between the various groups of Jews.  Also, the book suffers from a decidedly anti-American bias.  For instance, the author repeatedly suggests that America should offer up reparations to the Africans for slavery and to the Native Americans.  This is absurd in my opinion.  While the reader of this book may learn a great deal about the particular dealings of various Jewish groups in their efforts to further their own degree of control, very little is offered in the way of further understanding.  Movies such as \\"Schindler's List\\" and books such as _Hitler's Willing Executioners_ have attempted to smear the entire nation of Germany for the slaughter of the Jews in the Holocaust.  Also, repeatedly ignored in any discussion of the Holocaust is the murder of the Gypsies, the mentally deficient, and various other ethnic groups.  This is indeed unfortunate.  Further, in a new form of political correctness, individuals on the Left have attempted to brand the Catholic Church with the evil of the Holocaust.  This is particularly ridiculous considering that many Catholics were persecuted by the Nazis precisely because they were Catholic.  In addition, Holocaust literature has become more and more far-reaching, including levels of exploitation that in fact never really existed.  While the original works on the Holocaust are being ignored, modern updated, politically correct works on the Holocaust are continually being mass marketed by the Holocaust Industry.	2002-12-30

Thus, as distinguished from the traditional Ludditism (i.e. rejection of technology) and anti-technological focus of the traditional right, certain thinkers among the conservative revolutionaries in Germany after the First World War were able to accept the idea of technological progress while rejecting the Enlightenment ideals of rationality.  These thinkers distinguished between Technik and Kultur and tried to bring Technik into the realm of Kultur and out of the realm of Zivilisation.  Brought together by the experiences of the front (Fronterlebnis) during World War I, the reactionary modernists praised a masculinized ideal of technology.  Such reactionary modernist thinkers including Oswald Spengler, Ernst Junger, Carl Schmitt, Martin Heidegger, Werner Sombart, and Moeller van den Bruck were precursors to fascism and national socialism (and in fact many became outright Nazis before the Second World War).  _Reactionary Modernism_ focuses upon the thinking of such \\"conservative revolutionaries\\" as these thinkers as well as upon the thought of the German engineers and their understanding of capitalism and socialism and various aspects of the Third Reich and Hitler's movement.  On one side were the ideals of \\"blood and soil\\" and the Volk, opposed to the modern \\"liberal\\" ideals of capitalism, communism, and modern finance.  The reactionary modernists often were quite antisemitic contrasting the life blood of the German Volk with the more nefarious qualities of \\"Jewish finance and Bolshevism\\".  While much of the thought of the reactionary modernists fueled the catastrophe that became the Third Reich, reactionary modernism offered a unique perspective which synthesized the aspects of Techniks and Kultur while rejecting the ideals of the Enlightenment.	2002-12-09

Paleoconservativism emphasizes such aspects of society and culture as tradition, family life, religion, populism, nationalism, and protectionism as a trade policy.  The paleoconservatives are firmly opposed to immigration, the welfare state, the New Deal and subsequent legislation, and often to free trade and unnecessary interventionist wars.  Unlike many \\"neoconservatives\\" who have lost touch with the conservative tradition and now emphasize globalization, internationalism, and interventionism, the paleoconservatives have tried to retain a nationalist/isolationist outlook.  These essays featuring such thinkers as Murray Rothbard, Frank Chodorov, James Burnham, Russell Kirk, Richard M. Weaver, Chilton Williamson Jr., William Hawkins, Allan Carlson, M. E. Bradford, Thomas Fleming, Paul Gottfried, Clyde Wilson, and Samuel Francis give a good introduction to the philosophy underlying the paleoconservative movement.  Topics include a history of the Old Right, the immorality of taxation, the managerial state, traditional conservativism, immigration, the breakdown of the family and the need for home schooling, the distinction between a free trade and a protectionist policy, and the need for a new kind of nationalism.  For those of us who see the sham of liberalism and modern day \\"neoconservativism\\", these essays offer some hope for a restoration of a traditional oulook opposed to modernism, multi-culturalism, internationalism, and modern day interventionism.	2002-12-01

This book examines the life and political thought of the Catholic intellectual, Hilaire Belloc.  Belloc was a radical along with his friend G. K. Chesterton and a Catholic intellectual who lived in Edwardian England.  His political thinking was an attempt to provide a sort of third way between capitalism and socialism, which he christened distributivism.  Much of this book deals with the turns his thinking took from his beginnings as a radical to his subsequent turn which lead to the publication of his famous book _The Servile State_ and his eventual favoring of monarchy as opposed to the party system.  Opposed to socialism, distributivism allows for individual ownership of property and the means of production.  Much of Belloc's thinking is opposed to modernism and retains a medieval outlook which is heavily influenced by his Catholicism.  Also, Belloc broke with the party system, finding both parties to be driven by the same group of interests, and opposed the new legislation which would eventually give rise to the modern welfare state (which he predicted in his _The Servile State_).  Belloc's thinking offers a unique perspective for Catholic individuals who look for an alternative philosophy to that of modern day consumerism, capitalism, and socialism.  Unfortunately, society is heading more in the direction of Belloc's servile state and away from the alternative that Belloc proposed.  This book offers a fine introduction to his life and the development of his political thought.	2002-12-01

This book examines the thought of such thinkers as Karl Jaspers, Oswald Spengler, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernst Junger, Carl Schmitt, Thomas Mann, Max Weber, and in particular the philosophical thinking of Martin Heidegger and traces the development of their thought as it relates to the German ideology of war that developed after the First World War.  Praise of the battlefield, \\"the socialism of war\\", and the resultant reaction to technology and modernity play their unique roles in the transformation of the West during this period of crisis in Germany.  These forms of reactionary modernism, and nostalgic heroism are precursors to the rise of the Third Reich to power and the subsequent World War which follows that rise to power.  In particular, the author emphasizes how Heidegger's thinking is in line with this ideology of war and how his subsequent (though brief) alignment with the Nazi regime plays into his philosophical thought.  The decline of the West, the superiority of the Germanic peoples, the negation of the \\"universal man\\" of Revolutionary rhetoric, the \\"Judaic-Bolshevik conspiracy\\", and the ideologies of \\"Blood and Soil\\" and \\"reactionary modernism\\" are discussed by the author Losurdo as they relate to the unique philosophical grounding of the various thinkers above.  In particular, the thought of Max Weber and Karl Jaspers is shown to have fallen into the same ideological framework despite the fact that they would not openly sympathize with the Nazi regime.  This book is an important work for understanding the type of thinking that underlay the German experience before the Second World War, the philosophical basis of this thinking, and the roots of the ideology of war.  In particular, the thought of Martin Heidegger is examined and exposed as profoundly opposed to modernism and liberalism.  The exaltation of the European and the contrast between German Reich, Roman Imperium, and Hellenic Polis are expounded upon throughout.  The guilt experienced by the German nation subsequent to its defeat in the World War and the collapse of the Nazi Third Reich and a proper assessment of Martin Heidegger's unique philosophical thinking in relationship to this guilt is a problem which continues to plague students of this great philosopher's thought.  This book is important for what it has to say about that thought, for its understanding of these European thinkers and their inter-relationships, and for the role of the ideology of war played in each of their thought.	2002-10-22

This biography of the French Counter-revolutionary thinker, Joseph de Maistre, provides an excellent introduction to the thought of this Catholic militant.  Joseph de Maistre was an arch-reactionary opponent of the French revolution and proponent of a properly restored monarchy and Catholicism and a united Christianity under papal rule.  The main bases for his thought lie in his Catholicism, his adherence to Tradition and the monarchy, his anti-Modernism and reaction to the ideals of the French revolution, and in the occultist illuminism of Saint-Martin and the Freemasonic tradition.  In his \\"Considerations sur la France\\", de Maistre argues against the thought of the \\"philosophes\\" and eighteenth century Enlightenment thinkers and for a restored monarchy and Catholicism rooted in tradition.  Contrary to the Revolutionary idealism, Maistre argues that man is imperfect and rooted in sin and thus a rational reconstruction of society is doomed to failure.  In \\"Du Pape\\", de Maistre outlines his belief in papal authority and the supremacy of the Catholic Church.  As a Catholic de Maistre believes the Pope to be infallible and in the necessity of his wielding power over earthly sovereigns.  Both a Freemason and a Catholic, de Maistre argues for a Catholic subsumption of the Orthodox Churches, the Protestant Churches, and other schismatics and heretics under papal rule.  This particular book brought much strong reaction because of the radical nature of its main argument.  De Maistre's Catholicism is extreme in its opposition to both the Reformation and Modernity.  De Maistre spent much of his time in Russia as an ambassador for Sardinia, and in the \\"Soirees de Saint-Petersbourg\\", he presents arguments about various aspects concerning the laws and the need for a return to tradition.  De Maistre has unique thoughts about the origins of languages and the American Indians and other aboriginal peoples.  Contrary to the popular Rousseauian \\"noble savage\\" ideal, de Maistre presentsa much more realistic picture of the American Indian and the development of the world's religions from a primordial tradition and encounter with God.  His other works include discussions of illuminism, theosophy (especially that of Saint-Martin, to whom he was a follower of), supernaturalism and occultism, and the nature of tradition and government.  The author shows de Maistre to be a precursor to Romanticism in his aesthetic writings.  Furthermore, the author examines de Maistre's influence on subsequent thinkers including Catholics such as Jacques Maritaine, and others such as Charles Maurras and Baudelaire.  This book is an excellent biography of a reactionary opponent to the French Revolution and modernity, a Catholic Traditionalist, and a thinker who calls for a restoration of monarchism and privelege.  In particular, this book focuses on the role of de Maistre in literature.  While the thought of de Maistre would certainly not be considered popular today, his thought is a uniquely Catholic and traditional one which offers hope against the viscitudes of modernity.	2002-10-22

Originally considered to be Nietzsche's magnum opus, this book has now been relegated to an entirely different but still important status in the corpus of Nietzsche's writings.  This book influenced the thought of such European thinkers as Martin Heidegger, Ernst Junger, Oswald Spengler, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Julius Evola, and Mircea Eliade.  Nietzsche's call for an overcoming of nihilism through the affirmation of the eternal recurrence was taken up by Nazi intellectuals in their quest to breed a superior race.  Nietzsche argues for the creation of the \\"overman\\" through discipline and breeding.  In this work, Nietzsche attempts his \\"revaluation of all values\\" by examining the rise of European nihilism and the decline of Christian morality summed up in Nietzsche's infamous phrase:  \\"God is dead\\".  Nietzsche writes, \\"Nihilism stands at the door:  whence comes this uncanniest of guests?\\"  Nietzsche tackles head on the issue of nihilistic decadence, the overturning of all values hitherto regarded as the highest values.  He offers a powerful \\"Critique of Religion\\", \\"Critique of Morality\\", and \\"Critique of Philosophy\\".  In this aspect, he finds the source of nihilism to be the Christian religion itself, a sort of Semiticized Platonic idealism for the herd - \\"the little people\\".  These \\"little people\\" gave rise to Christian morality - a leveling of society -which Nietzsche thoroughly criticizes.  From the Semitic myth of \\"the chosen\\", arose the Christian moral ideal.  Against this \\"negative Semitic\\" religion of the New Testament, Nietzsche contrasts the \\"positive Semitic\\" religions encoded in the laws of Mohammed and certain parts of the Old Testament, the \\"negative Aryan\\" religion of Buddhism, and the \\"positive, affirmative Aryan\\" religion encodedin the Laws of Manu.  Nietzsche views this \\"negative Semitic religion\\" as contrary to the existence of the state and the aristocracy, and as having given rise to nihilism.  Against morality, moralistic idealism, weakness, and hypochondria, Nietzsche opposes the nihilistic affirmation of the eternal recurrence.  To Nietzsche, the eternal recurrence is the boldest idea, that when faced can lead to an overcoming of nihilism.  Nietzsche writes, \\"Let us think this thought in its most terrible form:  existence as it is without meaning or aim, yet recurring inevitably without any finale of nothingness:  \\"the eternal recurrence\\".\\"  For Nietzsche, the Will to Power is considered as knowledge, as nature, as society and the individual, and as art.  Nietzsche presents a biologistic interpretation of the Will to Power as life.  Nietzsche's final section of the book devoted to the matter of \\"Discipline and Breeding\\" outlines Nietzsche's idea of the eternal recurrence and how this must be faced by the \\"overman\\".  Nietzsche writes, \\"I [Nietzsche] write for a species of man that does not yet exist:  for the \\"masters of the earth\\".\\"  It is this call to overcome nihilism through the affirmation of the eternal recurrence which is the fundamental message of Nietzsche's thought.  Nietzsche's criticism of Christianity is indeed harsh, and I believe it to be wrong-headed, however his understanding of the Will to Power and the Eternal Recurrence present the most interesting aspect of this philosophy.  Indeed, it has been suggested that rather than being the atheist as he is so often called, Nietzsche does in fact have a god . . . however it is this \\"god\\" which is fundamentally distinct and opposed to the God of Christianity (cf. Paul Tillich).<br />For further reading on the matter of nihilism, see the book _Nihilism Before Nietzsche_ by Michael Gillespie.  In this book, it is suggested that the roots of nihilism rest in the philosophy of nominalism as was originally expressed in the medieval period.  Also, it is suggested that a new understanding of God as Infinite Will is necessary, contrary to Nietzsche's mere assertion \\"God is dead\\".	2002-10-16

In _The National System of Political Economy_, Friedrich List advocates an economic policy of nationalism based on the philosophy of protectionism.  List argues that protectionism can lead to greater national economic benefit and argues against the system of laissez-faire free trade.  The book is divided into four parts:  The History, The Theory, The Systems, and The Politics, each focussing on a particular aspect of the theory of protectionism.  List rails against the \\"cosmopolitical\\" theory of free trade economists such as Adam Smith as espoused in his _Wealth of Nations_.  In particular, List contrasts the systems of protectionism in America and Germany against the system of free trade advocated by the British.  He gives the history of the rise of the Hanseatic League in Germany against the British.  He advocates abolishing the tariffs between the individual German states but erecting a tariff wall around the German nation, thus creating a strong federated Germany.  List refers to this as the \\"insular supremacy of the Continental powers\\".  Against Britain, List advocates a protectionist policy for North America as well.  Of particular interest is List's discussion of the difference between agriculture and manufacturing powers.  For instance, List contends that an agriculture nation without manufacturing will remain subsidiary to a nation which has manufacturing.  Thus, the need for creating a nation which can sustain both manufacturing and agriculture.  Rather than the individualistic standpoint of economists such as Adam Smith, List argues for political economy to be seen from the standpoint of the nation.  The book contains many further insights into the value of protectionism as a trade policy to create a strong national economy.  In a world being continually driven in the direction of mass globalization and technocracy, this book by List offers an alternative policy to maintain national sovereignity.  While the classic works of free trade economics are highly important, especially the ideas of their originator Adam Smith, List offers cogent critique based on his nationalistic point of view.  In sum, this book provides a much needed remedy to the dangers of globalization and the New World Order.  Unfortunately, the advice of nationalist thinkers is not being heeded in today's political climate.important, especially the ideas of their originator Adam Smith, List offers cogent critique based on his nationalistic point of view.

The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism.  The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism.  Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism.  For example, some historians have argued based on a \\"scapegoat theory\\" that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world's ills.  Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews.  Arendt explores the rise of Antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state, the emancipation of the Jews, the rise of the Jewish financiers, the roles of Jews within society, and the infamous Dreyfus affair.  Of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as Benjamin Disraeli or the infamous forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The idea that the Jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of Antisemitism.  The second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of Imperialism.  Here, a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as Count Arthur de Gobineau and various forms of Social Darwinism.  The role of the Boers in South Africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as Cecil Rhodes, who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic Nordic elite, is made.  The great Pan Movements, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Germanism, and the Pan-Arabism of T. E. Lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored.  The final volume of this book is concernedwith Totalitarianism proper.  Here, the role of propaganda and the secret police, as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.  Arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing.  Arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely.  Repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent.  Written during the Cold War period and just after the Second World War, this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.  Their movements of Nazism and Soviet Communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished.  The book is important today not only for historical reasons, but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world.	2002-10-09

In this liberty classic, the Catholic intellectual Hilaire Belloc writes that the present system of capitalism is likely to give rise to something new, the servile state, because of inherent instabilities within it.  Belloc defines this state as, &quot;That arrangement of society in which so considerable a number of the families and individuals are constrained by positive law to labor for the advantage of other families and individuals as to stamp the whole community with the mark of such labor we call the servile state.&quot;  This servile state is a return to the form of pagan slavery that existed in Europe before the advent of Christianity abolished it.  Belloc contends that from the original pagan form of slavery, Christianity brought about a new system of society, the distributivist society.  In this system, every individual was an owner of property and belonged to guilds which allowed for him to own the means of production.  However, the distributivist system failed with the breakdown of the Christian faith.  For example, the Reformation allowed for the Crown to confiscate monastic lands.  Thus, a small group of indiviudals, the capitalists, came to own the means of production and the property.  Belloc does not blame the existence of capitalism on the Industrial Revolution like most other thinkers have.  Rather, he sees the problem in society as existing before the Industrial Revolution.  Belloc contends that had distributivism not broken down, the Industrial Revolution would have been beneficial to all concerned.  The current system of the capitalist state is unstable however, and may give rise to one of two separate things.  Reformers have tried to create from the capitalist system a collectivist (or socialist) state.  In the collectivist state, private property would be abolished and a group of managers would control all property for the proletariat in trust.  Belloc contends that this form of collectivism is likely to give rise to a third thing, the servile state.  One way reformers have tried to accomplish this goal is through &quot;buying out&quot; capitalism.  Since the state is an older institution than the capitalist owners, it has been considered possible that the state can &quot;buy out&quot; the capitalists.  Belloc finds such an idea problematic and shows how this is not possible to occur.  Alternatively, the other possibility is for society to return to a distributivist system in which all individuals own property and the means of production.  Belloc finds this alternative to be the best, however, he notes that it is unlikely to happen given the current direction in which society is taking and amounts to &quot;swimming upstream&quot;.  So, while the socialist alternative works within the capitalist system, it will ultimately lead to servitude.  Belloc points out examples of how legislation designed to benefit the proletariat has actually increased the development of the servile state.  Examples of this include regulation such as employee compensation and minimum wage laws, which were in the initial stages of being enacted in Belloc's England.  The future for freedom looks grim because the proletariat is willing to give up its political freedom in exchange for security and guarantee of subsistence standards.  For example, Belloc points out that minimum wage laws actually benefit capitalists because they guarantee that there will not be unruliness among the workers.  Also, such laws and regulations involve the creation of a class distinction between proletariat and employer.  Given the direction the welfare state has taken contrary to liberty and towards further regulation, these cogent writings of Belloc from near the beginning of this last century serve as an important warning and prophecy for the future.  We have indeed headed in the direction of servitude, and Belloc's distributivist ideal seems less and less likely.<br />For an interesting alternative understanding of the modern world and its condition see Julius Evola's _Revolt Against the Modern World_.	2002-10-09

This rather silly book is about a very silly individual and his machinations to further his own blend of antiAmerican hate.  I am delighted to see the smug Noam Chomsky taken apart and revealed for what he is a neoNazi and antisemite, far left extremist.  While his linguistic researches are very important, Chomsky seems to feel that combined with his prestigious academic post they qualify him as some sort of expert on geopolitics and the world in general.  The man all but would proclaim himself king of a New World Order were he given the opportunity to.  In the murky underworld where the far extremist left meets the far extremist right, we encounter the exploits and shenanigans of Noam Chomsky, a man who will engage in the most outrageous polemic, distortion, outright lying, slander, and scandal to boost his book sales and increase his notoriety.  Despicable!  Chomsky's own particular brew of antiAmerican hate has a million coffeehouse intellectuals teeming.  And, it is precisely for this reason that it is good to see a book revealing his connection to French Holocaust deniers (\\"a sort of apolitical liberal\\", as Chomsky so eloquently describes them) and neoNazi groups.  The arrogance of these academic elites is inconceivable.  This book is to be recommended to all your closet Marxist \\"friends\\".  Also recommended Kevin Coogan's _Dreamer of the Day_ for another look at the meeting place between the far right and the far left extremes.  Bravo!	2002-09-23

Books	5	12	18	N	N	Arab and Jew.	_The Zionist Connection_ is written from the perspective of an antiZionist Jew.  The author takes a look at the situation in the Middle East, the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israeli Jews, and places the blame on the state of Israel.  The book basically tries to show that support for Israel is contrary to America's best interest (as they were defined in 1978 when the book was written) and is also morally suspect.  The author contends that a single special interest group, the Zionists, have wrapped America and its leaders in a stranglehold in their attempt to maintain an \\"Israel First\\" foreign policy.  The author distinguishes Zionism from Judaism, and he views Zionism as an idolatrous usurper.  By appealing to emotion and memories of the Holocaust and cries of \\"antiSemitism\\" this single group of Jews has basically forced the United States into this position.  The author contends that much of the press is Zionist controlled and that it is by appealing to \\"Christian guilt\\" that these Jews have gained their position of prominence.  The book concludes with a section on the wars between Israel and the Arabs, as well as a discussion of such events as the U.S.S. Liberty attack.<br />... The gory details of the brutal killing of a Palestinian child are spelled out in the chapter \\"Terror: The Double Standard\\", but the details of Palestinian terrorism are totally suppressed by the author.  Nevertheless, the book is highly interesting and worth reading for the author's perspective on the Middle East, even if it is far too idealistic.	2002-09-04

In this short book, Seyyed Hossein Nasr takes a look at the relationship between man and nature and the spiritual crisis that inflicts modern man in his \\"war against nature\\".  In examining ecological crisis, war, and industrial failure, Nasr argues that modern science has lost touch with the sacred in its applications.  Rather than being rooted in the unified outlook of traditional man along with his religious traditions, modern man sees the world through the eyes of a crass materialism, scientism, and positivism.  It is this lack of worldview which Nasr believes is the spiritual crisis behind the troubled relationship between man and nature.  Nasr begins by examining this problem and explaining how a base scientism has attempted to uproot the understanding of traditional man.  In making this comparison, Nasr looks at the alternative philosophies of science, beginning with the positivists and comparing them to the viewpoints of various religious philosophers on the question of science.  Here it is necessary to understand the limitations of science, particularly as they apply to its application, which is at the root of the ecological crisis in modern man.  Next, Nasr turns to the historical roots of science in Greek and Christian philosophy and theology.  Nasr argues that much of the problem can be found in the neglect to emphasize these historical roots rather than simply glorify modern science.  By placing science within its historical framework, it is possible to see exactly how the crisis has come about.  Nasr argues that in particular, the breakdown of the Christian tradition and the secularization of science is at fault.  Next, Nasr turns to the metaphysical principles that underlie man's understanding of nature.  In particular, Nasr examines those principles as expounded in the traditions of the world's great religions:  Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, particularly with reference to Sufism.  Finally, Nasr seeks to explain how the retrievalof this traditional understanding of nature can be applied to the modern situation and crisis.  The book concludes with a discussion of what Nasr believes to be the errors of such modern theories and notions as that of evolution.  All in all, this book is an interesting discussion of the shifting relationship between man and nature, and it offers hope for the alleviation of spiritual crisis by returning to the traditions within the world's religions.	2002-08-24

The book fills a real need both as a historical and sociological account of these movements as well as offering a smattering of some of the different systems of thought available to the seeker.  The book deals with these movements and traces the esoteric thread from the most ancient sources to the modern era from a scholarly approach.  Included in this collection are essays on:  ancient and medieval esotericism and mysticism, Kabbalah in the Renaissance, Paracelsus, Rosicrucianism, Jacob Boehme, Freemasonry, nineteenth century esoteric movements, Rudolph Steiner, Theosophy, Rene Guenon and Traditionalism, G. I. Gurdjieff, and C. G. Jung.  A continuous link is established from Pythagoreanism, hermeticism, NeoPlatonism, and Gnosticism through the Middle Ages to the great mystics of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and on into the modern era.  Nearly every ancient and medieval mystic in these three major religions is discussed.  Alchemy and natural science arose from these ancient traditions and philosophies with a Romantic twist.  From the Jewish tradition of Kabbalism came the many hermetic Renaissance movements, for at one time the Kabbalah was considered a forerunner of Christianity revealing the Trinity.  The German physician, Paracelsus, provided inspiration for the German theosophist, Jacob Boehme and many other later followers of both.  The movements of Rosicrucianism, arising from the publication of a document alleging the existence of a secret society by a Lutheran minister, and Freemasonry, which adapted from its origins in medieval guilds to its modern form based on Enlightenment philosophy, are thoroughly discussed in separate essays.  By the nineteenth century, various occult movements became systematized through individuals such as the Parisian magus, Eliphas Levi.  In this era, Christianity experienced a renewal and a call for return to tradition was expressed.  This set the foundation for the occult movements of spiritualist medium, H. P. Blavatsky:  the Theosophical Society.  Rudolph Steiner, a German philosopher and spiritualist, broke away from the Theosophical Society of Blavatsky and introduced his own unique system of anthroposophy.  In France, the Traditionalist school arose from the writings of such thinkers of Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy.  The basis of the Traditionalist school is summed up, \\"tradition is what humanity has not invented but received, and which finds its starting point, in the final analysis, in the superhuman origin of things\\"  (p. 340).  From the metaphysics of Guenon, individuals such as Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Marco Pallis, Leo Schaya, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr, and of course Ananda Coomaraswamy have taken off and further developed this school.  (I recommend the book _The Only Tradition_ by Quinn as a good introduction to the Traditionalist school.)  The enigmatic and perhaps oppressive figure of G. I. Gurdjieff and his principle interpreter P. D. Ouspensky is the source of another modern esoteric movement.  Claiming to have received wisdom from ancient traditional sources, Gurdjieff created his school along with Ouspensky (who later broke away and created his own school).  Finally, the works of psychoanalyst C. G. Jung are considered in their relationship to Christian esotericism.  Jung has become immensely popular for his psychoanalytic methods as well as his unique understanding of madness and myth as arising from the same source, the collective unconscious.  Many have carried on the works of Jung, and the rest of the individuals here.  Overall, this book presents a very decent collection of interesting essays, which are invaluable to the student and seeker alike.ian magus, Eliphas Levi.

This work emerged from the &quot;Friends of God&quot; movement of the fourteenth century within the Catholic Church.  It sought to bring man to the life of Christ, following in the example of Christ along with those who have achieved true illumination.  The work contrasts these individuals, &quot;the illumined&quot;, with those who merely follow Christ out of desire for reward and with those who follow Christ and therefore believe themselves to be perfect, &quot;the free spirits&quot;.  Much of this is in reference to the movement of the &quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit&quot; which existed at that time and who interpreted Christ's resurrection as an opportunity to engage in libertine and liscentious acts.  The author of this tract responds disapprovingly to this kind of behavior and shows how it deviates from true Christian piety.  Thus, we see that those who follow the true light, follow in obedience but do not do so solely out of want of reward; they love God because He is Good and reject the &quot;I, Me, and Mine&quot;.  The work explains God's love of Himself as not a selfish form of love; but rather, God loves Himself because He knows He is Good and for that reason alone.  In the same manner, should the follower of Christ reject himself and love God solely because He is Good.  This is the message of the mystical author.<br />This tract had some influence in the medieval mystical movements and is similar to the mystical writings of the Dominicans Johann Tauler (who Luther at first believed to be the true author, later rejected) and Meister Eckhart.  Luther regarded this book as the third most important book he came into contact with, after the Bible and the writings of Saint Augustine.  Subsequently, the book had some influence in Protestant theology and orthodox Lutheranism, as well as some interest for Catholic scholars.  A must read for all interested in medieval mysticism or for those looking for spiritual fulfillment in the Christ-life.	2002-07-26

I'm not sure how much this book can be trusted.  But, it certainly raised some very disturbing issues for me about the direction of the post Vatican II church.  The author makes some rather bold claims about the &quot;new Church&quot;.  He seems to believe that the New Church has drifted into schism and is no longer able to supply its faithful with the needed sacraments.  This would mean that all Popes after Vatican II have been heretics.  He claims that the church hierarchy has sought to appease Protestants and other schismatics and has therefore lost it's rooting in tradition.  It would appear that much of the Catholic hierarchy has been infiltrated by freemasons and illuminists who have sought to &quot;soften&quot; the churches attitudes towards communism and the secular world.  What is most disturbing, however, is what the author has to say about the Novus Ordo mass.  The author claims that the New Mass does not sufficiently stress the real presence of Christ in the Eucharistic bread and wine.  Therefore, according to the author's arguments this would render the mass as well as many of the other sacraments ineffective.  I do not agree with many of his points here but he certainly raises some interesting questions about the direction of the Church and its attempt to appease modernists of all types.	2002-07-17

The author is obviously a blatant antisemite and uses some questionable sources (such as books put out by the Nation of Islam, which has had a fatwa put on it by the real Muslims, anyway); however, he makes some interesting points about this \\"religion\\".  The Talmudic writings which refer to Christ and Christians in general have been known to be very condescending for a long time.  These references to Jesus and Mary for instance are very offensive to the practicing Christian.  Also, references to rabbis \\"besting God\\" in a contest of wits, or otherwise ridiculous comments are equally troublesome.  The author makes some bold accusations, such as accusing the pope of \\"selling out\\" to the Judaic religions.  These of course are pretty ludicrous.  Also, only the downside of the Kabbalistic elements in Judaism are considered (their Luciferian elements).  Some medieval scholars consider the Kabbalah a precursor to Christianity, including references to the Trinity.  I do not agree with the author's take on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict; the Palestinians are far from the \\"innocent Arabs\\" the author portrays them as.  Otherwise, the book raises some disturbing questions about what exactly constitutes Judaism.  Is it a form of racial self worship of Pharasaic proportions or does it rest on a legitimate foundation?  Perhaps we cannot know these answers.	2002-06-21

Joseph de Maistre is one of the harshest counter-revolutionary critics of the French Revolution.  He calls for a return to traditional Catholicism and the Restoration of the monarchy.  The book _Considerations on France_ takes a look at his arguments for that tradition and his understanding of the dark side of human existence through his unique Christian perspective.  De Maistre was both a Freemason and a Roman Catholic, an arch-conservative traditionalist, and a strong believer in the primacy of papal authority in the secular and spiritual realms.  In this book, he criticizes those eighteenth century philosophers and their belief in progress and the &quot;social contract&quot; ideal.  He explains why the traditional development of society is more appropriate, given the rootedness of man in sin.  This is an important work to understand the thought of De Maistre, a Catholic reactionary.	2002-06-21

This book which was given in a series of lectures contains some remarkable insights into the relationships between the world's great religions (Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity) and the philosophies of the One.  The author examines the understanding of the One in Taoism, Confucianism, the Advaita Vedanta, Islamic mysticism, and Western philosophy.  In addition, the author examines the relationship between the Self and the One (dealing especially with the philosophies of Absolute Idealism of Fichte or Bradley, for example), the nature of mysticism and its relation to the One, and how the One is to be understood in terms of ethical and social ideals.  The book concludes with a chapter on the succession of metaphysical systems and the truth and how this related back to the philosophy of the One.  The author argues that metaphysics cannot be so readily dismissed as a mode of questioning, and that the One can be understood as having a special relationship to God and theistic philosophy in general.  In sum, this book features many fascinating insights into the world's religions and philosophical insights into the nature of the One.	2002-05-31

If you enjoyed Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_, you will undoubtedly enjoy this true life tale of magic, European politics, and murder.  The book gives an accounting of the life of Ioan Culianu, a professor of comparative religion at the University of Chicago, from his birth in Romania to his untimely murder.  Professor Culianu provided astounding insights into the world of magic and attempted to explain its occurrences through complexity.  He published many books on magic, comparative religion, shamanism, and gnosticism.  Like Mircea Eliade, a fellow Romanian and his mentor before him, Culianu contributed a great deal to our understanding of religion and magic.  He also wrote several novels along with his fiancee Hillary Wiesner.  This book provides a look into not only the worlds of Eliade and Culianu, but also a disturbing examination of far-right politics in Romania.  Culianu's murder remains unsolved despite its obvious link to his outspoken views on the Romanian revolution which occurred just prior to his murder.  However, many disturbing coincidences abound regarding this event.	2002-05-31

In an attempt to challenge the accepted scientific accounting of origins, Darwinian evolution, attempts have been made to claim our ancestors were space men from the stars, that evolution occurs in reverse, that eugenics or racism is necessary to explain human development, that the biblical account of creation in Genesis is to be interpreted literally, that our ancestors were aquatic apes, that the Urantia Book explains our origins, and that a certain UFO cult holds the secret to human conscious evolution (\\"Heaven's Gate\\").  The book includes a fairly decent discussion of Nazi ideas concerning evolution and eugenics as well as Social Darwinism.  Among the more bizarre theories suggested are those of the devolutionists (including the punk band DEVO).  For instance, the book _The Beginning Was the End_ by Oscar Kiss Maerth suggests that we owe our existences to cannibalistic brains-eating apes.  Another bizarre theory is that of Stanislav Szukaski, who contends that an ongoing struggle between true humans and Yeti-humans has shaped our history.  The book includes a bizarre discussion of the UFO cult which ended in tragic suicide, \\"Heaven's Gate\\".  Overall this book presents a strange concoction of some of the ideas floating at the further extremes of human consciousness.	2002-05-31

After the tragedy of September 11, a lot of misinformation has circulated about the beliefs of the Islamic extremists who were deemed responsible for these events.  In this publication by Feral House Press, we are able to see first hand the beliefs of many Islamic extremists as seen in their propaganda literature and political cartoons.  The book includes various materials of all sorts from individuals ranging from Yassar Arafat and the Palestinians to Muammar al Qaddafi to Sadaam Hussein to Usamah bin Ladin.  Much of this material is difficult to sort through and very disturbing given that it often involves threats of death to various Americans and calls for Jihad.  Given the viciousness of many of these groups and the recent events that have brought them to the fore, it is important for Americans to examine these materials from noted terrorists.  It should be noted that not all the material presented here is from terrorists nor is all of it even Islamic.

In this book, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke tries to give an account of the continuation of much of the Nazi philosophy after the demise of the Third Reich.  However, after his previous work _The Occult Roots of Nazism_ this book is surely a large disappointment.  The book presents chapters on the American NeoNazis (especially Rockwell), British Nazis (including Colin Jordan and \\"Combat 18\\"), Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey and James Madole, Savitri Devi, a collection of \\"mysterious\\" and occult phenomena surrounding the Third Reich, Wilhelm Landig, UFOs and Antarctic underground bases, Miguel Serrano, black metal, Nazi Satanism, Christian Identity, Nordic paganism, and conspiracy beliefs regarding the New World Order.  Unfortunately, there is very little holding this book together and it is rather poorly written.  Although the book is entertaining, some of the weirdest things you are likely to read about, it fails to achieve any sort of conclusion at all and resorts to gratuitous references to terrorism (the events of September 11, unconnected with Nazism at all).<br />For a much better account of NeoNazi and far right beliefs read either:  _Arktos_ by Joscelyn Godwin or _Dreamer of the Day_ by Kevin Coogan.	2002-03-30

Notice, it's not Why People Have Contradictory Belief Systems.  It's Why People Believe WEIRD Things.  weird:  curious in nature or unusual:  odd, uncanny.  Thus, it is apparent that &quot;weird&quot; does not refer to something internal to a belief system at all, rather it refers to a state of mind that accompanies the person encountering that belief system.  At this point, there is no reason at all to discard a given belief system simply because it produces a certain state of mind:  &quot;weird&quot;.  So, UP FRONT the author has all but admitted that the book is nothing more than name calling; therefore, meaningless.  Like virtually every single other so-called rationalist skeptic, the author has done nothing more than dogmatically asserted his world view as superior to everyone else's then proceeded to mock and jeer at all those &quot;inferior ones&quot; who don't share in his world system.  The author is certainly not skeptical of his own assumptions about the world.  He's not really a skeptic at all in fact.  Rather, he is skeptical of some things and not skeptical of others.  This would be fine, except that he should have enough respect to recognize that other views may have some legitimacy.  But the worst part about this is that the author has no imagination.  Rather, than spending time trying to advance a certain theory or explain a certain phenomenon, the author has chosen merely to argue against straw man versions of various theories he disapproves of.  Science progresses through the former, and achieves nothing but dogmatic staleness through the latter.  Unfortunately, this book is one of hundreds and part of a disturbing trend.	2002-02-25

This book includes some decent essays from all vantage points concerning the question of what is to be made of Heidegger's Nazism.  The first section of the book includes essays from Heidegger himself, including \\"The Self-Assertion of the German University\\", \\"Overcoming Metaphysics\\", and the brilliant interview with <<Der Spiegel>> magazine \\"Only a God Can Save Us Now\\".  The second section includes the important essay \\"Total Mobilization\\" by Ernst Junger as well as several other letters and essays dealing directly with Heidegger's Nazism.  Finally, the third section includes essays attempting an interpretation of Heidegger's Nazism from various standpoints.  A disturbing aspect of this approach is that many of the individuals writing these essays concerning Heidegger are themselves avowed Marxists, who supported a totalitarian regime far more bloody and repressive than the Nazis.  For instance, we have the essay of the despicable individual Herbert Marcuse.  This is from a man who lumped all of humanity into two categories:  the progressive and the regressive.  One can only wonder what sort of scheme Marcuse and his politically correct Marxist cronies had in store for those he deemed \\"regressive\\".  However, despite this, this book is important for understanding Heidegger's relation to Nazism, for his interview \\"Only a God Can Save Us Now\\", his later thought, and also for the essay \\"Total Mobilization\\" of Ernst Junger.	2002-02-17

The Church has embarrassed itself in it's opposition to science:  Newton, Galileo, Darwin, as well as lesser known figures such as Michael Servetus and Giordano Bruno.  Pedophiles, homosexuals, freemasonic cultists, and swindlers of all sorts have smuggled their way into the priesthood and the church hierarchy.  The God-complex has driven men to the brink of madness, grandiose delusions and megalomania.  Indulgences have been sold and annulments have been bought.  This of course is well documented and not really denied.  These are all disturbing aspects of the Church that the everyday Roman Catholic must somehow live with.  However, despite this, the postmodern Garry Wills has presented us with nothing new here but a collection of politically correct pap.

To Voegelin, these thinkers are all best described as \\"gnostics\\" and in their effort to create God's Kingdom on Earth seek to \\"immanentize the Christian eschaton\\".  In \\"The Political Religions\\", Voegelin traces back the origin of political religion to the Egyptian worship of the Sun, the cult of Akhenaton.  He traverses the history of the Middle Ages, and he shows how the archetype of the Christian apocalypse (a heresy to the orthodox Christian) came to occupy a central role in political religion.  He includes a good discussion of the leviathanic state of Thomas Hobbes.  Finally he ends with a compelling picture of the National Socialist state embodied in the Fuehrer.  Although he was criticized in this essay for not outrightly condemning the National Socialists, Voegelin stated that this in fact just reveals the satanic allure that this political religion holds.  To Voegelin, National Socialism is \\"satanic\\".  In \\"The New Science of Politics\\", Voegelin examines various modes of representation from Plato and Aristotle through the Roman Empire.  He then discusses the idea of gnosticism; he views the modern political religions as a restoration of the Gnostic heresy (condemned by early Christianity), an attempt to replace faith with certainty and bring about the Kingdom of God on Earth.  This idea arose in the apocalyptic tradition, transmitted through the Middle Ages by the followers of Joachim de Fiore.  He discusses in particular the case of the English Puritans.  According to Voegelin, the modern political philosophies of liberalism, communism, and the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes are under the spell of gnosticism.  In \\"Science, Politics, and Gnosticism\\", the most interesting of the essays presented, Voegelin delves into the thinkers Hegel, Marx (\\"an intellectual swindler\\"),Nietzsche (\\"the murder of God\\"), Heidegger, and psychoanalysis and National Socialism.  To Voegelin, these thinkers are all \\"gnostics\\", and the movements spurred by their philosophies are \\"ersatz religions\\".  <br />Voegelin represents an interesting alternative to modernity and liberalism.  And this book among his collected works serves as an excellent introduction to the thought of this profound thinker, philosopher of gnosticism.	2002-01-25

Yockey, who dedicated his book _Imperium_ to \\"the Hero of the Second World War\\", was a mysterious individual who was taken in one day by the FBI and just as mysteriously died.  Kevin Coogan tells this story of the supergenius mystery man who set out to create a European Imperium uniting forces from the far left and far right.  But, more than that, this book contains entire sections on such heroes as Oswald Spengler and Julius Evola.

P. Pavlov.  Pavlov conducted experiments on dogs and found \\"equivalent\\" (in which the brain gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli), \\"paradoxical\\" (in which the brain gives a response to weak stimuli but not to strong stimuli), and \\"ultra-paradoxical\\" (in which the brain gives a positive response to weak stimuli and a negative response to strong stimuli) behavior patterns present in the dogs under different conditions.  From his experiments, he concluded that all dogs have a \\"breaking-point\\".  Using these results, William Sargant (who worked with patients suffering from post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms during the war) examines the phenomena of religious conversion and persuasion as well as brainwashing.  Sargant conjectures that similiarly, all humans have a \\"breaking-point\\".  The book includes discussion of war victims, religious and political conversions (especially emphasizing the techniques of Wesley in his mass conversions of people to Christianity), possession and rhythmic dance, brainwashing in ancient and modern times, as well as the eliciting of confessions.  Much food for thought is presented as the author retells the stories of various individuals who have undergone drastic conversions or who have exhibited various forms of \\"paradoxical\\" behavior under the presence of sufficient stressors.  The discussion of confession is particularly interesting, in that it reveals that often the interrogator becomes just as deluded as the confessor may be.  In a world in which the masses are continuously bombarded by propaganda from all angles and the government, where cults are able to seize possession of individual minds and checking accounts, in which brainwashing takes place in totalitarian states, and in which the average person at any moment may be exposed to severe stressors, it is most important to study the human brain and the physiological processes behind conversions.  The book is not reductionistic, the author allows the possibility of an external force or power to be the causal agent of any conversion.  William Sargant's study will remain a classic for those of us who worry about the effects of political and religious propaganda and modern day stressors.	2002-01-20

There's a lot of talk of the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, the mysterious deaths of certain key individuals including Pope John Paul I, and the inner structure of a &quot;secret society&quot; which is determined to win the West back for the Church.  Some disturbing aspects about the relationship between Islam and Christianity are examined, as well as the workings of the United Nations.  If you remember when the Pope visited Jerusalem during the millennium celebration, you will recall how intense this moment was as the three major monotheistic world religions met.

Against a modern world lacking in values, meaning, and a traditional framework and presenting immanent problems of overpopulation, relativism, nuclear disaster, pollution, and the destruction of traditional cultures, is presented the perspective of the primordial tradition.  The author explains that there is only a single Tradition that underlies the traditional cultures which have existed throughout history.  As such, the work provides a basic outline and history of the ideas of Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy (as well as those of other expositors of the tradition such as Frithjof Schuon and Seyyed Hossein Nasr).  The author traces these ideas from the personal biographies of both Guenon and Coomaraswamy to the various organizations which grew up in France, England, North America, and Iran based upon the writings of these individuals.  (The author notes however that tradition is universal in application and therefore not localized to a particular point in time and space.)  The book then outlines the &quot;first principles&quot; upon which the Tradition is founded, distinguishing the various aspects of the &lt;&lt;philosophia perennis et universalis&gt;&gt;.  A brief synopsis of theosophy (&lt;&lt;theosophia&gt;&gt;) and it's modern manifestation in the Theosophical Society of H. P. Blavatsky is given.  An examination distinguishing between the two distinct forms of traditional culture (primitive and developed) is set forth.  In particular, the traditional culture of medieval Christendom is chosen as an example, and the idea of &quot;fusion&quot; - the totalization of traditional principles throughout the culture - is explained.  For the expositor of Tradition, the traditional culture may appear to be utopian in nature.  However, the author explainsthat various aberrations within such cultures demolish this utopian quality.  The author next turns to modernity and it's vicissitudes.  The &quot;reign of quantity&quot; and the denegration of &quot;quality&quot; as explained by Guenon is shown to be the persistant condition of a modernity based on a crude scientism and positivism.  As an answer to this emptiness of meaning, the author proposes a global planetary return to tradition, along with the arrival of a new planetary consciousness.	2001-12-24

We've known for a long time that between the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Jewish bankers, the Federal Reserve, the Knights Templar, the Nazis, the CFR, and the Trilaterals, we're all collectively screwed, this isn't new.  Nevertheless, this book is interesting for what it reveals about those secret societies which have been formed for the sole purpose of world domination -grandiose power-plots by megalomaniacs.  The New World Order is quickly encroaching upon us, and we must do something to take back our freedom.  It's an apocalyptic battle between good and evil.  The globalists in their effort to create a one-world empire have severely hampered United States sovereignity and the sovereignity of the individual.  Crush the New World Order and globalist elite!<br />The only problem I have with this book is that the author seems to go a tad overboard in his incessant bashing of Christianity and the Roman Church (totally uncalled for in my opinion), giving into ideas promulgated by such mindboggling idiots as Laurence Gardner and the writers of _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_.  Also, maybe it's just me, but I have a problem with the whole notion of aliens.  The author's theories become so much patch-work at this point that it's impossible to sort them out or to derive any more meaning out of them than that we're all slaves to alien masters.  To the devil with this!  Personally, I like to imagine a universe free of all aliens, cf. the Anthropic Cosmological Principle.  Although, I'm not nearly arrogant enough to assert that the existence of aliens can be ruled out a priori.  These counter-Christian and alien mythologies are really more products of a decadent modern world lacking a traditionalist foundation, and a restoration of various Gnostic and Manichean heresies.  In my opinion, Christianity is our only hope.  The information on the Federal Reserve, Rockefellers, and Rothschilds is very good.  These evil individuals along with their Freemasonic and Illuminati pals have consistently betrayed the national interests of America.  Abolish the Fed!  There are better sources for the Illuminati (one scholarly source is _Fire in the Minds of Men_).  The information on the Nazis is scant (a good source is _The Occult Roots of Nazism_).  With regard to the Nazis, the theories of one Trevor Ravenscroft should be taken with a grain of salt.<br />Overall, this book is a hodge-podge of conspiracy theories.

Lyndon LaRouche is portrayed as a comic book archvillain with a megalomaniacal desire for world domination.  Read about how LaRouche plays both sides of virtually every issue, using dirty underhanded tactics, smear campaigns, and illegal fund raising methods, to get his way.  LaRouche is painted as a type of cult leader wielding absolute authority over a group of his zombified henchmen.  Basing his philosophy on an amalgam of German idealism (Leibniz, Kant, Hegel), Karl Marx, Plato's _Republic_, neoNazi antiSemitism, and his own homebrewed concocted conspiracy theory (viz. the Queen of England deals drugs)LaRouche's delusions appear to know of no bounds.  The book details his involvement with the intelligence community (CIA, KGB), the Teamsters union, the KKK, Manuel Noriega, and other shady organizations.  LaRouche's politics swung violently from Left to Right, typical of such fascist dictators as Mussolini.  There are some interesting discussions of Plato's philosophy and education system, nuclear arms proliferation, nuclear fusion, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), and LaRouche's crank economics theories.  Throw into the pot racist doctrines, and antiSemitic (antiZionist) rhetoric.  LaRouche certainly defies classification.  All in all an interesting, and amusing book, about one of the most eccentric (and evil) of fringe political figures.	2001-12-12

Unfortunately there is a tendency to assume that all individuals who are particularly intense, eccentric, moody, or creatively inspired are manic-depressive; however, this is simply not the case.  While many of the individuals described by the author in this book did indeed suffer breakdowns, engaged in self-destructive behaviors, or were prone to wild changes in mood, there is little reason to assume that mental illness is an essential component of creativity.  Furthermore, as with all of her books, the author seems unable to face the dark, destructive side of things and tends to romanticize mental illness.  In addition, she tends to associate manic-depression with high social status, artistic accomplishment, creativity, and genius which not only serves to re-inforce stereotypes but also takes away from the genuine suffering of those who are not so blessed.  As with all her books, this one is really for the high IQ, highly socially connected, creative manic type who is capable of channeling his changes in mood into artistic and creative endeavors.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of those who suffer from this illness are not so capable.  Thus, it is a fallacy to suppose that manic-depression is either an essential component of creativity or that it entails creativity.  Many individuals suffer alone and in silence from depression or other mental disorders and they never have much hope of accomplishing works of greatness.  And many of those who are manic engage in various self-destructive behaviors without ever accomplishing a work of high quality.  In fact, in many cases either mania or depression may prohibit an individual from accomplishing valuable work.  While one is in the throes of mania or depression one is simplyunable to concentrate and thus lacks the necessary mental resources to focus on accomplishment.  This is the unfortunate fact of the matter, and I believe her books do not face up to this reality, ignoring the social issues raised by severe mental illness and the dark, destructive side of manic-depression.  Furthermore, many of the individuals discussed in this book eventually were to take their own lives (or starve themselves to death or engage in risky behaviors which led to their death), and thus the world was robbed of any future accomplishments they may have brought forth.  In addition, there is also the tendency to apply the label of manic-depressive to all individuals who may have had breakdowns.  This leads the author to conclude for example that van Gogh suffered from manic-depression and not schizophrenia as previously believed.  I think that while there is some evidence to indicate that van Gogh suffered from an affective disorder, there also is the fact of his hallucinations and psychosis which are less easily explained (perhaps epilepsy or some other psychotic disorder).  Thus, the author prematurely reduces all signs of temperamental instability or nervous breakdown to an instance of manic-depression, and this reduction may be unwarranted.  In addition, there is always difficulty involved in any sort of retroactive diagnosis, and ultimately like most attempts at this endeavor it becomes pretty pointless. <br /> <br />What this book does include is some fairly interesting descriptions of both manic and depressive states in certain inspired individuals.  As someone who has experienced a great deal of inner conflict at times, I could relate to many of these descriptions even if I could not relate to some of the more outlandish behaviors.  The author includes discussions of the supposed seasonal nature of this illness, emphasizing the role of biological cycles (the role of light and dark for example) and proposing possible theories to explain them.  The author attempts to relate this to peaks and troughs in creative output among artists and writers.  This for me was fairly interesting and I could relate it to periodic changes in my own life.  The author assumes that manic-depressive illness is inherited, although she does not really suggest an adequate evolutionary theory to explain it.  To some this may still be a debatable point, as it has not been conclusively proven yet.  She does attempt to show an association between creativity in near relatives of those afflicted with this illness and those who possess the full blown form of this illness.  However, it should be pointed out that manic-depression is not something that neatly fits into categories.  Many individuals who possess this illness in one form or another do so to varying degrees and there are many variations in the manner in which it affects them.  The author contends that mania (given the tendency of manics to exhibit a flight of ideas) is a natural conducer of creativity.  She illustrates this for example by quoting some remarks made about Coleridge (who she claims suffered from this illness), showing his tendency to rapidly move from idea to idea linked by the most tenuous of associations while at the height of his manic state.  However, it should be pointed out that often the thinking of manics can become so disordered with thoughts and ideas linked together by such tenuous threads that it becomes impossible to focus rendering any creative advantage effective moot and reducing the stream of consciousness produced to nonsense.  On the other hand, the author also contends that melancholic states may also lead to creativity as the individual overcomes them, because they allow for philosophical reflection and doubt.  This seems more probable; however, again it must be pointed out that in the throes of severe depression thoughts are likely to be singly focused and thinking slowed down.  The author provides a fairly interesting sketch of the life of Lord Byron, showing both his flamboyant temperament as well as the troubled history of his family.  The author also provides genealogies of various individuals including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Schuman, The James Family (William and Henry James in particular), Herman Melville, Samuel Taylor Colderidge, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, and Vincent Van Gogh.  Among others discussed in the book, the author also examines the lives of Poe, Lowell, Blake, and Keats concluding that they all were manic-depressives.  Following this, the author turns to a discussion of the use of the drug lithium.  She shows not only the positive effects of this drug in dampening the oscillations of manic-depression, but also some of the side effects that may be associated with this drug.  Among these, particularly disturbing is the blunting of emotion and a decline in creativity.  Whether or not this actually occurs and to what extent this is a necessary trade-off is really a question that must be answered on an individual basis.  The author also provides an interesting discussion of the potentially horrifying consequences of modern genetics.  In the past, many eugenicists did not propose the elimination of manic-depression because many individuals from prominent families possessed this illness.  However, with the rise of modern genetics it may happen that certain individuals will attempt to eliminate this illness entirely.  Particularly horrifying is the idea that mothers will abort or will be forced to abort their babies if they are believed to be carriers of this illness.   <br /> <br />As someone who at times has suffered from much of this myself, I found this book to be both enlightening and disturbing.  While many interesting points were raised about this illness, I did feel that the real social issues involved were not being addressed.  On the other hand, I wonder if a useful study could be made on the prevalenceof this illness among mathematicians and philosophers for example.  I am aware of at least two famous mathematicians who suffered from this illness (Norbert Weiner and Georg Cantor) and my experience tells me that many more do also.   <br />	2001-09-20

So:  a traditionalist Catholic, an orthodox Jew, a Lakota shaman, an American scientist, a civil libertarian, a psychologist, or anyone else who disagrees with a bunch of narrowly defined BS about &quot;productionist metaphysics&quot; and Reichian pseudo-science or anything else proposed by a bunch of French a**holes is now a fascist.  Anyone who would like to found a community based on traditional values or who dares to suggest such &quot;ultra-reactionary heresy&quot; as that there might be an objective truth or the commonsense notion that perhaps &quot;reason is indeed reasonable&quot; is really a fascist in disguise.

This book should be read by every patriotic American so as to realize exactly what is going on in our universities.  The author presents a philosophy in total opposition to the liberal democracy found in America and the natural (biological) relationship between man and woman.  It appears that the universities have become breeding grounds for fascist ideology (disguised in PC psychobabble BS) and the progressive feeding of the victimization complex of certain radical feminists (whose beliefs express their OWN psychopathology more than anything else).<br />For instance, can anyone in their right mind decipher the following piece of text:  \\"He opposes the metaphysical drive to acquire \\"master-names\\" which found and justify totalizing institutions and practices.  To this onto-theo-logo-centric metaphysical quest for the ultimate signifier, Derrida opposed the practice of \\"dissemination,\\" the revelation of the uncontrollable overflow of \\"SPERM, the burning lava, milk, spume, froth, or dribble of the seminal liquor\\"\\".  (p. 261)?  In the footnote that appears to this piece of work, it is stated \\"I owe this reference to John Caputo\\".  I can only speculate that this is some sort of inside joke among the elites.  God only knows the intention of this passage, but it is interesting to note that I came across the following quote, \\"Michel Foucault remarked of Jacques Derrida, \\"He's the kind of philosopher who gives [junk] a bad name.\\"\\"  (from the book _Illiberal Education_ by Dinesh D'Souza).<br />Among other gems suggested or implicitly supported by this author are:  the idea that freedom of speech needs to be abolished as being an instrument of a \\"totalitarian\\" system (as evidenced by his implicit support for a statement by Marcuse p. 262) and the idea that the feminine is to be placed in a position above the \\"dumb brute\\" masculine (p. 271).  The author also suggests that technology is an attempt by the masculine to dominate the feminine nature.  This is incredible given the feminist support for the \\"revaluation of all values\\" project proposed by the infamous Friedrich \\"Don't forget the whip!\\" Nietzsche.  It amazes me that the radical feminists find no quibbles with a misogynist such as Nietzsche, but a scientist or technologist with progressive leanings who may even be a woman herself is somehow a \\"rapist of nature\\".  It's amazing given these feminist assertions that only men are found to be fighting in wars.  Perhaps we can understand war as a feminist project to \\"get back at the male for institutionalized marriage\\"?  In any event, it appears that the university system has become coopted for the geo-political war games projects of feminist Nazis.<br />While you're reading this don't forget to pay special attention to the ideas of anarchist-fascist Ernst Junger and his glorification of the spirit of war and \\"total mobilization\\", which did so well under the Nazis.

In _The Revolt of the Masses_, Ortega y Gasset offers us a powerful diagnosis of the modern European political arena - the rise of the mass-man.  Ortega y Gasset refers to a kind of &quot;hyper-democracy&quot; in which the mass-man has risen to such a degree that he now takes upon himself the cutural areas formerly reserved only for the nobility.  Rather than believing that he is granted certain rights, the mass-man now assumes that he is entitled to those rights as a given.  This has led to an overwhelming mediocricy among leaders.  Furthermore, a reign of specialization, with an increasing number of men (&quot;specialists&quot;) who know more and more about less and less, has brought us to a dangerous point in world history.  Ortega y Gasset contends that the masses intervene in everything and that their form of intervention is solely by means of violence.  He suggests that a new form of primitivism exists in which civilization is just assumed as there, in a similar way to which nature is taken as given for the primitive.  He also points out the dangers of technicism and statism, which both are the direct consequence of the rise of the mass-man.  Europe no longer can hold its position of world dominance, but according to Gasset this is lamentable only because nothing has arisen to take its place.  Ortega y Gasset discusses and finds problematic both Bolshevism and Fascism.  The idea of what constitutes nation is discussed, and Gasset concludes that it is not solely ethnic, cultural, or linguistic in nature.  Ortega y Gasset concludes that European culture suffers from certain &quot;defects&quot; and that it is in these defects that the root of this phenomenon of the mass culture can be found.  By determining exactly what these are and finding a moral code for Europe, this difficulty can be overcome.  This book provides much food for thought, especially for those troubled by the ever-growing difficulties associated with over-crowding, specialization, and the decline of high culture.	2001-07-05

Nietzsche contends that an opposition existed among the Greeks between the Apollinian, the restrained and ordered, and the Dionysian, the irrational and destructive force out of which arose tragedy.  Nietzsche suggests that the pessimism responsible for the creation of tragedy is a sign of vitality, under the influence of Schopenhauer.  Nietzsche contends that tragedy entered into a decline with the arrival of Socrates and that the Socratic is in fundamental opposition to tragedy.  In Plato's _Republic_, Socrates remarks that tragic poets are not to be tolerated in his ideal republic.  The Socratic with its emphasis on rationality, and arising from it the subsequent development of modern science, is thus placed in opposition to the absurdity of tragedy, which allows for the affirmation of life despite its suffering and hardship.  It is for this reason that tragedy died and was replaced by a naive optimism, which is present in the modern world.  The book originally ended at this point, but subsequently Nietzsche added a second half which attempted to explicate the rebirth of tragedy among the Germans.  Nietzsche was under the influence of Wagner at this point and would later come to criticize this portion of the book in his &quot;Attempt at Self_Criticism&quot;.<br />_The Case of Wagner_, which is included in this book for contrast, is a witty polemic against what Nietzsche considers to be the decadence of Wagner's art.  This book is important mostly for understanding the complex relation that existed between Nietzsche and Wagner and their subsequent fall-out.	2001-06-29

The book is quite profound and asks us questions that concern the very nature of man and his universe.  The author describes Heraclitus as a thinker who rejected life in the political sphere for a life removed from the Greek polis where he could engage in speculation and his own researches into the process in all things.  Central to his thought is the idea of Logos.  This has influenced the thought of many future generations, as well as the Christian religion.  By achieving contact with the Logos, man can achieve a more harmonious existence.  Heraclitus can be understood using the concept of apophasis, or &quot;affirmation through negation&quot;.  This is a way of telling us what something is, by telling us what it is not.  The author explains how this works for Heraclitus in much detail.  The author also discusses such terms as physis (nature), ethos (human nature), and telos (purpose) and how they all play an essential role in the thinking of Heraclitus.  He also discusses how Heraclitus' thinking is applicable to the modern day understanding of consciousness, modern day physics, society, and the historical understanding of the development of philosophy.  Finally, the author discusses how one should view the notion of esotericism, esoteric thought, and whether we should reject, or alternatively, idolize the past.  Heraclitus is indeed a fascinating figure, a philosopher, an alchemist, a teacher, and a profound thinker who has left his mark on Western civilization (and is even popular among some Eastern philosophers).  And, this book is a fine survey of the meaning of his thought.	2001-06-25

The book does not so much focus on Heidegger, as it does try to understand his political involvement in light of that of other philosophers.  Fortunately, the author does not engage in senseless moralizing, nor does he attempt to exonerate Heidegger, but only to examine the relationship that philosophy bears to politics.  The most important notion that played a role in the minds of Nazi philosophers was that of crisis.  It is for this reason that the philosophies of Fichte and Nietzsche were chosen as important forerunners of National Socialism.  In fact, Heidegger's rectoral address included parts that were modeled on a similar address given by Fichte concerning the French Revolution.  The book argues that far from being a unified body, the philosophy of the National Socialist period was divided into many factions.  The conservative camp argued for a return to Kant.  The radical camp was based upon the ideas of Nietzsche, for example, and included Heidegger.  Arguments over idealism versus realism, and absolute values versus relativism framed the debate at the time over which philosophy served as a legitimation for the Nazi revolution.  The book provides much interesting information about some of the lesser known philosophers or those whose political involvements had been covered up, at the time.  Heidegger attempted to step out in front and direct the Nazi movement, attempting to legitimize it through his philosophy, but ultimately withdrew into silence, for various reasons.  His silence was so pervasive that he never really commented on his involvement again, except for an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; where he avoided any real discussion of the necessity of philosophical legitimation of political events.  This silence has plagued the minds of both his fans and his enemies.  Ultimately though, the Nazis themselves rejected their supposed philosophical forerunners, in that, they believed National Socialism to be its own unique movement and not simply a logical conclusion of Nietzsche, for example, as was first argued.  Other philosophers involved in the movement either slipped into silence as did Heidegger or even into obscurity, made some sort of apology, stopped philosophizing altogether, or had their involvement covered up.  The book offers some fairly sane conclusions about this involvement and involvement in politics in general, as well as a short discussion of the relationship between power and truth.	2001-06-25

The book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose, written by Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas, Beowulf, and the Viking sagas.  From these sources, especially the Edda, the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok.  Then, the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern European peoples.  The figures of Odin, Thor, Loki, Balder, and the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here.  Whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok (the Twilight of the Gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race, as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature.  Ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian worldview.  Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried, you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand Northern Europe in pre-Christian times.  Finally, it must be noted that in many ways, at least in my opinion, the society of the Vikings was superior to our own.  I admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats.	2001-06-17

I read this book hoping for a much needed clarion call for a return to tradition, a la Rene Guenon and Fritjof Schuon, et al.  I was somewhat dissappointed.  Anyway:<br />The good. In this book, Huston Smith a professor of religion presents a series of essays about overcoming the post-modern (or as it's now spelled &quot;postmodern&quot;) worldview and re-establishing metaphysics with an emphasis on transcendence.  He presents a unique Weltanschauung based upon the world's major religions and a return to traditionalist thought.  In this much, I agree with him.  His version of perennialism, the primordial philosophy, is far better than the nonsense that passes for philosophy under the guise of post-modernism (postmodernism).<br />The bad. The problem is that Smith seems to think that all the evils of the West can be attributed to that universal bugbear science, and its growing infiltration into the humanities and philosophy.  He is correct in that science is the guiding principle (dare I say, religion) of our times.  However, the problem is that he takes this anti-scientism to an absurd extreme.  Saying that science (and it's practical application in technology) is the sole cause of the loss of transcendence within our worldview is about as goofy as saying that it can be blamed on &quot;mixing with inferior races&quot;.  For instance, while the Darwinian theory certainly has problem areas and is ultimately rooted (in perhaps suspect) philosophical assumptions, his dismissal of it strikes me as incredibly facile.  At the risk psychologizing things, and thereby engaging in a veiled argumentum ad hominem, I believe his problem with science might best be explained as a personal dislike attributable to working as a professor of religion and philosophy at MIT, a school devoted almost entirely to science and engineering.  Perhaps a little bitterness at his colleagues crept in here.  Sorry for that.<br />The ugly. Finally, it's a minor point, but good heavens.  Someone needsto tell this guy that outside of the snooty confines of academia no one gives a care about whether you refer to them as &quot;humans&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;womyn&quot;, or whatever.  Chiding G. K. Chesterton (a conservative Catholic writer) for not being politically correct and referring to humanity in the masculine form &quot;man&quot; is about as ridiculous as someone saying Hitler's _Mein Kampf_ is &quot;marred by an anti-Jewish bias&quot;.  Sorry for that, but these things need to be said folks.  It gets annoying.	2001-06-17

In this book, which is at once brilliant and incredibly pretentious, Hans Kung attempts to show that it is reasonable to believe in God, even and especially in light of the modern world.  The book is essentially a book of doubts, in which virtually every conceivable modern complaint and doubt about the necessity of God's existence is expressed and countered.  The book is long, hard, extremely taxing (especially if you engage it properly) and terrifically complicated, so I won't even attempt to do anything like summarize it here.  If you truly engage this book, you may find yourself both profoundly troubled and even perhaps experiencing the phenomenon of conversion, e.g. as happened to St. Paul on the road to Damascus.  These are profound questions which have troubled the mind of man since he became conscious of himself.  They are all the more difficult because there can be no &quot;fence sitting&quot;.  As Pascal says, &quot;You must wager!&quot;<br />For what it's worth, which likely isn't much, here's what I get out of the book.  The atheist position, which is the doubt of God's existence or even the actual denial thereof, has a certain instability to it.  The problem with this position is that while the Christian may be wrong in saying that the life of the atheist is intolerable, there is a tendency in fact for the tolerable to become &quot;unbearably tolerable&quot; - i.e. meaningless.  The atheist can easily slide into nihilism - extinction into boredom (nothingness).  It is against this tendency that the atheist is constantly at odds.  On the other hand, the theist position runs into problems in that the theist is perpetually confronting the potential of doubt and to overcompensate for this, he runs the risk of retreating into fanaticism.  Obviously despite all the atheist &quot;disproofs&quot; to the contrary, belief in God's existence lives on.  So we have reached an impasse.  We might ask the question, Is fanaticism bad?  Yes and no.  As politically incorrect as this statement may be, I contend that fanaticism is not nearly as bad as the alternative.  If nothing else it shows that one has indeed something to live for.  If one considers the Socratic dictum, &quot;Know thyself!&quot; as a guiding principle to living one's life, then in fact isn't fanaticism precisely this knowing of one's self?  Or put another way, fanaticism is the conscious recognition of what one does in fact believe and the upholding of that belief in the face of skepticism.  It is for this reason, however that a return to the traditional Thomistic proofs for the existence of God may be necessary.  While a confrontation with modernity need not be taken to absurd extremes, the alternative of being assimilated into a meaningless existence is far worse than any reaction to it.  Fortunately, Kung does not fall into a naive pluralism but asserts the exclusivity of the Christian revelation.  (This of course is a difficult, troubling, and even painful question in the light of other faiths, but one that must nevertheless be answered.)  Where Kung does err, he errs on the side of not being dogmatic enough.  (As an aside his capitulation to certain feminist beliefs about the &quot;goddess&quot; and a primitive matriarchy, which virtually all experts now claim did not exist, is appalling.  But, I won't hold it too much against him.)  Nevertheless the book is good, and it will provide countless arguments for apologists to use against the fans of Nietzsche or Freud for example.	2001-06-16

Do you hear that roar?<br />Finally a book for, by and about pseudointellectuals.  Pseudointellectuals are so often marginalized and generally just plain screwed over by their intellectual peers.  It's time they had their say and came to the fore.  Yes, we like games, puzzles, things analytic, and even - horror of horrors - mathematics, and now it's okay to admit it.<br />When I first saw this book at the bookstore, as I flipped through the pages, I immediately thought:  TOO COOL!  A book where you can rip out all the pages, put them in a box, throw them all out the window of your seventh story apartment, then go out and pick them up in some random order and read them.  I don't usually read fiction.  But, this I just knew I had to get.<br />This book operates on several levels.  It is a multidimensional text - just thinking about the layers at work here boggles the mind, an edited version of a text prepared from a film (i.e. the story has pased through many hands before it reaches you).  The book mocks academic writing in it's use of excessive footnotes to the point of absurdity (most of them leading nowhere), nested footnotes (footnotes within footnotes, footnotes within footnotes within footnotes, etc.), gratuitous displays of erudition, petty remarks about the characters couched in high-faluting academic garb, etc. etc.  Or to put it better, as the nondedicatory dedication has it:  This book is not for you.  (This of course being equivalent to dedicating the book to no one at all.)  There are two stories intertwined.  On the one hand you have the whacked out ramblings and sexual exploits of wannabe badass Johnny Truant, tattoo parlour extraorinaire.  These are here to provide comic relief and are tolerable only if you can get over the gratuitous porn and the annoying use of &quot;could of&quot; and &quot;should of&quot; when they should be &quot;could have&quot; and &quot;should have&quot;.  Then, you have the story of the photographer Will Navidson, who lives on a house which is bigger on the inside than on the outside, and which grows, changes, all hell breaks loose, well you just have to read it to understand.  There's more than enough here to keep you occupied for hours and hours on end.  Enjoy.<br />Other books you might like include Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_ and Douglas Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_.  (Of course you know this already, I'm just name-dropping.)  Do I sound overly enthusiastic?  Whatever.  It's supposed to be fun.  If you aren't having fun, you're wasting your time.  (For the PC thought police, yes that's elitist.  You know what, I don't care.)<br />P.S.  Some of the footnotes in Chapter IX have been written backwards.  At first I thought they could be read by being held up to a mirror.  But, it turns out that instead of just being reversed, they have actually been typed backwards.  The only way I can see to read them is to mechanically type them out letter by letter in the forwards direction.  I wonder if anyone has done this yet.  Hmmm?<br />P.P.S.  You'll notice the absence of the annoying oxymoronic buzzword &quot;postmodern&quot; in this review.	2001-06-15

This book basically consists of the conversations Ouspensky had with Gurdjieff (referred to only as &quot;G.&quot; throughout the book) and G.'s presentation of his system, the Fourth Way.<br />First.  I don't want to make to much of this as there is an enormous amount of material presented in this book, but I must confess that honestly this book left me more confused than I was before I read it.  I don't understand what happened between Ouspensky and G., why there is so much obfuscation of this on the part of Ouspensky, and whether or not this undermines the credibility of the whole system presented.  Ouspensky simply refuses to discuss his break with his teacher and I find this troublesome because throughout the book he has chosen to include personal details of his relationship with G. but at the end he simply refuses to do so.  Also, I don't understand what happened to Ouspensky during the period of time when he allegedly &quot;woke up&quot; and was given telepathic communications from G.  Ouspensky has muddied the waters here again, making it difficult to assess his claims.  Furthermore, I don't know what he means by the &quot;transfiguration of G.&quot;, how G.'s appearance changed.  Finally, I don't know if Ouspensky is being objective when he presents G. as a somewhat authoritarian individual.  How much of this &quot;authoritarianism&quot; is simply necessary to maintain the proper discipline in working on oneself.  These questions troubled me when I read the book.<br />Now that that's over with, I can get to the content of the book proper.  The Fourth Way presented by G. is a method for man to liberate himself from his &quot;mechanicalness&quot;.  This way is distinct from other ways of liberation:  the way of the fakir, the way of the monk, and the way of the yogi.  G. has some very interesting ideas about the nature of man, his perpetual slumber in mechanicalness, and how he must strive to overcome this slumber.  He also provides explanations for the orderin the universe, life on Earth, the causes of wars, the nature of esotericism, the nature and degrees of consciousness, and much else besides.  He presents a kind of alchemy and a mathematical procedure making use of the law of octaves to understand these phenomena.  Ouspensky goes into a lot of detail about this; however, it is difficult to get at what is really going on in a cursory reading.  Also, Ouspensky leaves much out (since these are reconstructions of conversations and lectures given by G.).  G. presents this system and then attempts to construct his school - a group of individuals united with a common purpose of working on themselves.  It is very interesting to see how he does this, and it gives a good picture of G.'s resourcefulness.  Much of what took place in this book took place during the turbulent period of the Russian revolution and there is much discussion of the meaning of what were then current events.  That said, I do not really know how to evaluate this system presented by G. because for me the book leaves open too many questions (which I have alluded to above).  The book is interesting and thought provoking though and certainly merits the attention of any person who seeks spiritual liberation and freedom from mechanicalness.	2001-06-15

This review is with regards to the Robinson and Macquarrie translation of _Sein und Zeit_, the only one I've read.<br />This book is perhaps the most pretentious single volume ever written, with Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ coming in a close second, vying in a power battle with Hegel's _Phenomenology of Spirit_.  One is simply taken aback by the sheer audacity of a man who would dare to &quot;raise anew the question of the meaning of Being&quot;.  [In the outside world, such an individual would be rightly locked away safely in an asylum for the insane, but in the hallowed halls of academia such an individual is able to spend his whole life &quot;searching for the meaning of Being&quot;.]  He believes that this question of Being has been forgotten by the philosophical tradition, and in order to reconsider it, he must first deconstruct that tradition and bring it to light once again.  And, he proceeds from there using Husserl's phenomenological method (&quot;to the things themselves&quot;) as a basis for conducting his fundamental ontology.  And, so it goes.  In order to answer this question of the meaning of Being, Heidegger considers the Being that man is, Dasein (literally &quot;being-there&quot;).  He explicates Dasein's being as Being-in-the-World, and distinguishes two different modes of such being, the authentic and the inauthentic.  In the inauthentic mode of being, man is &quot;fallen&quot; in the They (&quot;das Man&quot;).  As such he engages in idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity.  Heidegger then proceeds to search for an authentic Being-towards-death.  And, he explicates time as the transcendental horizon for the question of the meaning of Being in the second division.  The book is incomplete.<br />Many have spent a good part of their lives trying to decipher this man's intentions, making excuses for his Nazism (or the other alternative saying there is no excuse for his Nazism), carrying forth his work on out into the wilderness, or more likely simplyengaging in posturing exercises to impress their friends (note the many examples of such reviews here).  Unfortunately, a sorry point is missed in all this.  And, that point can be put succinctly thus:  What's the point?  Sure metaphysics may be fun, we may feel ourselves in contact with another world, it's great for the &quot;high IQ challenge&quot;, and such lofty endeavors carry on the philosophical tradition and make us &quot;great men&quot;.  But, has Heidegger really gotten at the meaning of Being?  Hell no.  And, what does Heidegger even mean by a &quot;search for the meaning of Being&quot;?  Perhaps, this is nothing more than a disguised quest for a kind of belief in God.  Something to think about.  Or, more appropriately, something to not think about.<br />                                  -an anti-intellectual	2001-05-15

In this scientific adventure book, a Harvard ethnobotanist visits Haiti to try to get a glimpse into the world of the Vodoun religion and the process of making zombis.  His mission is to discover by what potion or powder zombis are created and bring this back to the U.S. for scientific analysis.  But, he also undertakes to explain zombification as a cultural artifact within the Vodoun belief system, a sort of syncretistic phenomenon incorporating elements from African religion and Roman Catholicism.  The book details much of his adventure in Haiti, his involvement with Vodoun priests and magicians, and his involvement with Haitian secret societies.  It is a thoroughly fascinating read and provides a unique image of a very singular culture.<br />The book begins with the author's early career at Harvard University.  He contacts the professor Richard Evans Schultes, a famous ethnobotanist, and he begins his first journey to South America to collect plants.  Upon returning after a near mishap, he enters Schultes' research group and one day receives and invitation to pursue research into zombification from a well known psychiatrist in New York.  The benefits of a discovery of the zombification formula are tremendous with applications to anesthesiology.  So, he undertakes a journey to Haiti to determine this formula.  Once in Haiti, he explores the various Vodoun ceremonies and contacts Max Beauvoir, a local authority on the Vodoun religion.  Max Beauvoir's young daughter helps Wade Davis (the author) get around in Haiti and converse with the locals.  He forms the initial hypothesis that the zombi powder consists of datura (a psychoactive plant which is strongly hallucinogenic in small quantities and poisonous in large quantities) and that the antidote consists of Calabar bean.  However, this will prove to be incorrect.  After haggling for some time with Marcel Pierre, a houngan (Voodoo priest), he succeeds in making the powder and discovering its psychoactive components.He sends this back to the U.S. and it proves beneficial.  The author later will return to Haiti and explore the deeper into the world of Vodoun culture and the zombification process.  Here, he encounters secret societies, which interact with the government in various ways.  He also delves into the history of Haiti and explains how these societies have arisen as revolutionary movements in that history.  He becomes quite enamoured of the Haitian people and even considers joining a secret society at the end.  However, he decides against this, because of the intense code he would be bound to follow were he to do so.  Finally, he leaves Haiti to return home to write his book.<br />The idea of zombification is a very interesting one, and this book has certainly gone a long way in explaining it.  But, in some ways it will always remain mysterious.  It turns out that the zombified individual is usually someone who has broken a code within the secret societies.  The powder puts the person in a catatonic state, only to be reawakened and given an &quot;antidote&quot; (which is actually largely inactive).  However, it is not so much the powder that determines the zombi as it is the cultural surroundings of the individual.  For instance, the same component used in the powder is known in other cultures to cause paralysis and &quot;returns from the dead&quot;, but it is never taken to be a cause of zombification.  So the culture of Haiti and the Vodoun religion are actually the most important components of this procedure.  This is the discovery of Wade Davis.<br />This book is a great read, and you will enjoy it if you like science and adventure in foreign lands.  :)	2001-04-25

When I was a child, I spake as a child.  I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.       -1 Corinthians 13.11.<br />Like virtually everyone else, I read this book in high school after I had finished Umberto Eco's _The Name of the Rose_ and _Foucault's Pendulum_, which I greatly enjoyed.  I forced myself to finish it simply to prove that I could.  Here's the way it is folks:  Robert Anton Wilson (RAW - as he refers to himself) is an infant, and he wants to be treated like a screaming brat infant.  Give him a slap!  His admirers, all suffering from attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder (AD/HD) after reading this book are infantile too.  The &quot;philosophy&quot; (certainly not meriting that dignified epithet) behind this book is nothing more than a series of self-competitive hedonistic nonsense progressively aiming to outdo each previous iteration of its own ridiculousness in hopes of achieving something revolutionary - a series of baubles used to amuse three year old babies.  However, there is no synthesis, nothing is produced from it.  Rather, it would have us all robots driven outside of our minds by every blind and base impulse imaginable in a hedonic frenzy, all the while engaging in remorseless rape of the language to achieve some sort of verbal ecstasy.  To overcome the ennuie which immediately ensues we are provided with grandiose puzzles (paradoxes) to contemplate with ever increasing absurdity.  This sort of mental hedonism can lead to only one thing, total and complete destruction.  It is not the highest in man; rather, it is in fact his lowest.  Instead of seeing this as a product of euphoriant intoxication or mental disorder (let's not give it that much credit folks, even drugs or mental disease would produce more profound effects), I prefer to look at it as the product of a reasonably intelligent mind that has chosen to systematically disengage its will.  This philosophy comes complete with ameans of self-identification among its anarchist followers, through the presence of the word &quot;fnord&quot; appearing at various places in their reviews.  As you can tell by reading some of the reviews here many of Wilson's disciples seem to have mastered the art of sesquipedalian obfuscation - an iterative procedure to generate pseudo-profundities by the successive manufacture of nonstandard grammatical combinations through the use of excessively big words.<br />P.S.  By the way, if you're going to send me an email calling me a fascist, an &quot;authoritarian personality&quot;, a control freak, or whatever other psycho-anarchist buzzword is popular among latte' drinkers don't even bother.  I don't respond to that.  It seems every time I tell it like it is about Wilson, one of his hypnotized &quot;disciples&quot; sends me hate mail.<br />[If you agree with me on this point, but would still like some alternative type literature to puzzle over, I recommend both Douglas Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_ and Mark Danielewsky's _House of Leaves_.  For the real Illuminati, read the book _Fire in the Minds of Men_, which discusses the role of freemasonry in the French and Bolshevik revolutions.  For conspiracy read Pauwels' and Bergier's _The Morning of the Magicians_.  Hell, even Pat Robertson's _New World Order_ and _The Unseen Hand_ by Epperson carry more weight than this.]	2001-04-25

Like virtually every single other so-called rationalist skeptic, the author fails to take a look at her own assumptions about the world and be skeptical of them.

(I need not even say what kind of self-righteous arrogance this requires on her part.)  She's not a skeptic at all really.  Rather, she is skeptical of some things and not skeptical of others.

(The Rise of the Superman)	Reality is not only stranger than we suppose but stranger than we can suppose. -J. B. S. Haldane<br />Quit thy childhood, my friend, and wake up! -Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br />Absolutely mind-expanding!  In this book, the authors expound a thesis of &quot;fantastic realism&quot; and explore the mind, not in the subconscious or conscious states but in what they believe to be ultraconsciousness.  The book is able to cover virtually every topic from atomic energy, to secret societies of alchemists, to the influence of the occult upon Hitler, to parapsychology and consciousness, and finally to the upcoming superman - a mutant capable of astounding intellectual feats.  The authors cite numerous previous explorers:  Rene Guenon, Teilhard de Chardin, Carl Jung, Charles Fort, Gurdjieff, and the work of mathematicians, especially Cantor's theory of the transfinite.  Bizarre theories are considered:  Horbiger's theory of &quot;eternal ice&quot; (and it's influence on Hitler), Teed's theory that we live on the concave inner surface of a hollow earth, theories to explain the origins of civilization, the work of the alchemists and their possible knowledge of atomic physics, theories regarding mutation of the human species, and theories propounding alternative origins for life on this planet.  The authors are able to consider all of this and put it together in a coherent whole, under the idea of &quot;fantastic realism&quot;.  They dare to ask such questions as:  Are we all in a collective conspiracy to hide the truth, is science such a conspiracy?  Do secret societies exist and do they have an influence upon history?  What special knowledge did the ancients possess that we may not possess now?  What role did secret societies play in the origins of Nazism, and in the Nazi Black Order?  How were the Nazis able to rise to power and what did such a phenomenon represent amidst our modern world?  What is the historical meaning of the atomic bomb?  What does the future promise for our civilization?  And, Do supermen live amongst us men, and if so, have they always?  Hypotheses are put forth in answer to all these questions.  The authors reject a magical worldview and they also reject the narrow confines of scientific positivism.  However, they consider it necessary to keep an open mind when examining these phenomena, and they refer to themselves as &quot;barbarians&quot; seeking to search out a scientific explanation to be imposed on the fantastic.  The book is simply amazing, and truly life-affirming.  You MUST read it!  Not just to understand yourself and your world, but also to understand your future.  You will never be able to perceive things in the exact same light again.  Get this book and discover the mysteries of the world for yourself!  :)	2001-04-13

This beautifully written book describes the role of the theosophy of Emmanuel Swedenborg in the philosophy of Schelling.  Schelling's reading of Swedenborg and his incorporation of Swedenborg's theology and notion of the &quot;spirit world&quot; into his own system are discussed.  Schelling suffered immense pain with the death of the two women that he loved, including his wife.  He was deeply troubled, and he sought out Swedenborg's writings, who allegedly had contact with the realm of spirits to comfort him.  The existence of the realm of spirits and the special way by which Swedenborg was graced with knowledge of it raises many philosophical questions.  Despite the fact that Kant had given Swedenborg a negative review in his _Dreams of a Spirit-Seer_ and thereby damaged his reputation, Schelling and others of a similar mind had gone back to Swedenborg's writings and examined his claims.  Among these claims was that the souls of husband and wife were reunited in the afterlife.  This meant that contrary to the traditional Christian view, gender was preserved in the afterlife.  This idea was particularly comforting to Schelling.  Also, Swedenborg claimed that the planets were inhabited by men and that Christ's redemptive act applied universally to all these inhabitants.  This idea also was considered by Schelling.  The book considers the unique role that the mind and spiritualism of Swedenborg played in the thought of Schelling.  However, like many others Schelling eventually came to reject parts of the eschatology of Swedenborg because of it's &quot;heretical content&quot;, that went against the orthodox view.  While Swedenborg remains an unorthodox figure, many have come to consider him &quot;the last of the Church fathers&quot;, endowed with a special gift.  The book examines biblical and philosophical ways of assessing this gift of prophecy (especially in the letters of Paul).  Whatever epistemic status may be assigned to his encounters with the spirt world, they certainly provide much interesting reading and a unique way of understanding the Christian message.  This book provides an excellent introduction to Swedenborg and his influence upon Schelling, in his life and work.certainly provide much interesting reading and a unique way of understanding the Christian message.

As an intellectual adventure story this book is top rate.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I virtually read it in one sitting.  That alone merits the book five stars; however, it is not without faults.  I don't want to appear overly down on the book, but I do feel that I must point these things out.  For one thing, the Holy Grail is not the Ark.  They are two completely separate artifacts, and despite the fact that Hancock uses a lot of fudgery to convince himself of this, he is wrong.  Next, the Knights Templar may have found the Ark, but again this is unlikely.  Also, the book is a bit of a let-down because Hancock never actually finds the Ark.  He rather assumes he has found it and then let's the reader's imagination run amok.  While the Ark may be in Ethiopia (this is the most likely place for it's location), Hancock does not definitively show this.  Many have faulted Hancock for what they term his &quot;Egyptian bias&quot;.  I myself do not.  Anyone who has seen the Great Pyramids or even pictures of them knows that there is more to ancient Egypt than meets the modern eye.  Egypt was pretty much the center of the ancient world, and it should be treated as such.  Unfortunately, Hancock fails to reveal or appreciate the importance of the religious element in any rediscovery of the Ark.  As a vessel which basically served as the meetingplace between man and God for the ancient Hebrew, a rediscovery of the Ark would be of immense religious significance for the Destiny of the Human Race in it's relationship with the Divine.  This book is for dreamers and seekers, for those of us who view human history as guided by Providence and who continue to look for the primitive artifacts of our ancient ancestors in a better attempt to understand the place of man in this world.<br />A word of warning.  I liked this book a lot, so I attempted to find some other books of Hancock's to read.  About this:  Don't even bother.  He ends up &quot;selling out&quot;to the &quot;aliens crowd&quot;, who regard all the ancient myths as nothing more than a battle between mankind and the aliens (whatever that might mean).  Wherever an unknown creature or something mysterious occurs, they attribute it to aliens.  This is a religious type of movement and a product of postmodern decadence.  It's not that I'm hostile to the notion of aliens (however, I myself admire the kind of radical super-humanism behind such modern notions as the Anthropic Cosmological Principle), but the idea that aliens at one time inhabitted the earth is pretty much unfounded.  This totally fails to appreciate the ancient myths for what they are, encoded science, encoded history, and the psychological attempt by man to give meaning to his existence.  As such, it robs man of his proper place in the universe and his relation to nature.  In his other books, Hancock just throws speculation upon speculation in an attempt to support these unsubstantiated hypotheses.<br />However, don't let this detract from the quality of this book, or the meaning behind man's search for the lost Ark.	2001-03-29

Long has man hungered for a return to a Golden Age, an era before the present one when he lived in idyllic bliss and was free from all the constraints and toils of modernity.<br />This book tells the fascinating tale of a source of hidden wisdom carried down through the ages preserved in the archetype of the Poles.  The author examines the presence of this tradition in the writings of many eccentrics, cranks, mystics, visionaries, scientists, and science-fiction writers.  He looks chiefly at the writings of H. P. Blavatsky and Rene Guenon, and he tells the tale of the &quot;Aryan race&quot; as revealed through a set of polar mysteries.  Everything from the Nazi secret societies (e.g. the Thule society), to the neo-Nazi Black Order, to the spirituality of the polar tradition, to the mad and bizarre ramblings of insane prophets is told in full detail.  Writers such as Evola, Schwaller de Lubicz, and Serrano are examined and their possible links to fascism explained.  The author also deals with the Theosophists, the mysticism surrounding the poles, and the idea of a Ruler of the World who lives in Tibet, Aghartha, or Shamballah.  Much is dismissed as mere nonsense, but also the true secret behind these myths is hinted at.  Finally, scientific evidence surrounding the Earth's tilt and the precession of the equinoxes is presented, and the writings of the &quot;illuminates&quot; are compared with those of modern day geologists.  The reader is left spellbound by tales which are not only totally bizarre (e.g. the hollow earth theory of Teed, that we live inside a hollow earth on it's concave inner surface), but which often also become incoherent and border on paranoid delusion.  (There is a link here between these authors and madness.)  The real question that needs to be asked is, What does it all mean?  In one particularly disconcerting passage at the end of the section on the &quot;Spiritual Pole&quot;, the author sums up what he believes to be the presence of the polar archetype in many diverse writers and visionaries.  He then goes on to say that the pole must not be political because of its use by the Nazis (in the Thule Society).  I feel he is disingenuous here after citing example after example of writers who used the polar idea precisely as a cover for political aims.  Obviously the pole is political, and it remains so.  I believe it would be more correct to say that not only is the pole political, but also that it's politics are too deeply entrenched for us to fully understand at this time.  Perhaps, it is universally present in the mind of man, biding it's time, until the dispossessed individual is put under sufficient stress that it reveals itself to him and provides him with an interpretative framework to understand the world through (viz. Jung's &quot;collective unconscious&quot;).  When someone turns to wonder, What is this all for?, this is when the archetypal appearance of the pole becomes manifest to him.  It is an angry reaction to those societal forces which would attempt to oust tradition and reconstruct society along more &quot;satisfactory&quot; lines.  As such, it is not revolutionary, but restorationist in nature.  This is the meaning of the polar symbolism and its use by the various writers and prophets presented in this book.  Fundamentally, it is a call for a return to tradition, the only tradition that predates the modern era and that will restore order to the chaotic world in which we live.	2001-03-29

This book chronicles some of the underground movements and popular delusions that existed in Germany and Austria before the Nazis came to power.  It examines the influence these groups may have had on Nazi leaders in the SS, on Adolf Hitler, and on the thinking of Germans at the time.  It is necessary to understand such extremist and occult groups in order to understand how the Nazis were able to take over Germany.  Millenarian fantasies and a kind of cultural paranoia preoccupied the German mind, and these fantasies came to hold a unique place within various secret societies set up to propagate racist and occult doctrines (especially concerning the role of the &quot;Aryan&quot; race and it's existence in German prehistory).  The author examines many eccentric German individualists, dreamers, and romantics and their role in occult societies.  These include:  Guido (von) List, who claimed to have rediscovered a Wotanist religion and was influenced by the Theosophist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky; Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, who resurrected a sect based on the Knights Templars; the Ariosophists, who relied on a &quot;theozoology&quot; concerning the struggle of the Aryan race, and their secret societies, the Germanenorden, the Thule Society, and the Edda Society.  The author also considers the influence of such individuals as Rudolf von Sebottendorf, Herbert Reichstein, and Karl Maria Wiligut on the SS (Himmler), and examines the role Ariosophical thinking might have played in the development of Adolf Hitler.  The book includes several appendices, one of which deals with some of the sensationalist and &quot;crypto-historical&quot; literature that has sprang up around the occult and Nazism, which attributes a great role to the occult in the rise to power of the Nazis.  This is an important book for understanding how collective delusions can arise in the mind of a country, particularly racist ideologies.  The Nazis continue to exercise a fascination upon us, both for their brutality and for their nationalist mysticism.  And, this book allows us to understand.<br />[If you are interested in this kind of thing, I can also recommend any of the works by Norman Cohn, who is cited repeatedly in this book.  He deals mostly with the medieval period, but you'll notice that the same sort of delusions and fantasies keep on cropping up throughout European history.]	2001-03-24

The Modern Age is falling and the West is in an era of decadence.  The darkest of all the dark ages, what the Hindus called the Kali Yuga, is before us and Ragnarok (Twilight of the Gods) is at hand.  Tradition has been trammeled upon by modern utilitarian, pragmatist, and collectivist thought and the once sacred has been made profane.  Mass-man is so caught up in collectivist thought and meaningless activity that he cannot be saved.  Only a select group of elite traditionalists preserving the traditional Weltanschauung can restore a transcendent order to the world after the fall of this era.  An ascetic neoscholasticism is needed to preserve the tradition intact while this cycle comes to an end.<br />This is the message of Julius Evola in _Revolt Against the Modern World_.  In this book, Evola fully dispels the modern myth of progress and reveals it as nothing more than a cover for a decadent society.  Evola spends the first part of this book and much of the second part expostulating a traditional world order based on the idea of immanence-transcendence, before it's break-up at the end of the Middle Ages.  He explains how an occult band of knights, members of the warrior caste, preserved tradition in the form of chivalry, during this period.  However, with the advent of modern times, this tradition has largely been lost to us.  Evola develops a myth of man's origins in a Golden Age, a Hyperborean race at the pole.  A conflict developed between North and South, and between &quot;solar&quot; and &quot;lunar&quot; forms of religion.  This conflict was at the heart of medieval Catholicism, and was reflected in the growing separation between priest and ruler.  Originally, Evola argues, the Church sanctified the monarchy (the emperor) by a special rite.  However, when this practice ended it made possible conflicting national loyalties to split up the medieval picture.  With the Protestant Reformation which produced a strong emphasis on individualism more damage was doneto the traditional world.  As such, the world of tradition was lost and covered up by a world based more and more on utilitarian, hedonist, and ultimately collectivist principles, especially as witnessed in the French and Russian revolutions.  This is the grim state of affairs we find ourselves in today.  (Evola leaves off with a view of Europe &quot;enclosed in the pincers&quot; of America and the Soviet state, with America becoming more and more collectivist in nature and thinking.)<br />Man must return to the values which are transcendent if he ever is to create a meaningful life.  And, this is precisely what is absent from today's empty, hollow society.  The philosophies of radical individualism and collectivism, nationalism and communism, pervade every aspect of our existence.  And, we have lost much.  Only by a return to tradition can we hope to achieve a new existence with a newfound meaning.<br />Julius Evola was a fascinating character with much of interest to the dreamer and the mystic.  Unfortunately, he allied himself with fascism briefly; however this is not the true basis for his thought.	2001-03-19

First as a novel of suspense and intrigue, an intellectual adventure, this book is great.  You will literally not be able to put it down.  That's where the five star rating comes from.  That said, however, there is something not right going on here . . . it just doesn't bode well.  The naive of course are busy either attacking the book for its wild (ridiculous!) style of speculation upon speculation and poor historical method (they are right, but for all the wrong reasons of course), or they are praising the book as some astounding new discovery.  There's nothing really new here however.  Anyone familiar with the Koran knows that it presents a radically different picture of Jesus than that found in the Bible.  And, heresy has been around since the beginning, folks.  God knows the Church has enemies, enough to fill an entire continent.  But, I feel the important thing here, and the overlooked important thing at that, has absolutely nothing to do with the concocted pseudo-history of Jesus' alleged marriage to Mary Magdalene, and the propagation of some sort of bloodline from her (there simply is not any documentation of this). . . . Okay, let's cut to the chase folks, and this is the disturbing question to ask.  But, we have to ask it.  What the hell is the Priory of Zion, and what does it want?  And, who the hell is Pierre Plantard, and what does he want?  Those reviewers who believe there is more than meets the eye here are likely right.<br />Let's look at this alleged organization, the Priory of Zion.  What are its goals?  Obviously they are political.  Are they nationalist?  Are they communist?  Or, do they promote some sort of other, as yet poorly understood, political ideology?  I believe it's likely that the authors ran into (or they themselves were part of) a ring of spies, who repeatedly left cryptic messages in the Parisian library under the title &quot;Les Dosiers Secrets&quot;.  And, as spies are known to do, what better way to pass on their message than to encode them in some postmodern occult myth, a bloodline stemming from Jesus Christ, the Merovingian dynasty, the Knights Templar, the prophecies of St. Malachy (and just think what these have to say for the future of the papacy), the artwork of Poussin, the mystery of Rennes-le-chateau, the crazed priest who puts a sign on the door of his church &quot;This place is terrible!&quot;, and of course the secret society the Priory of Zion . . . we know where this is leading.  Obviously these things could easily be taken as code-talk for the current state of political affairs.  French political affairs no less, French Revolutionary political affairs.  And, that's precisely what I believe they are.  (The careful observer of political affairs might want to take a look at the book _Fire in the Minds of Men_, which discusses in great detail the workings of secret societies, mostly Freemasonic and Illuminist in nature, behind the French and Russian revolutions.)  This book has the stench of bad European politics to it.  And, we all know how bad, bad European politics can be, especially given the atrocities of the past century.  My personal hunch is that what you have in your hands is a piece of Bolshevik propaganda; call me paranoid.<br />Interestingly, Umberto Eco took up the themes in this book and wrote the &quot;fictional&quot; (yeah right!) novel _Foucault's Pendulum_.

US	50058656	RB00Q4A78Z9F1	0679449450	89406899	The Aryan Christ: The Secret Life of Carl Jung	Books	2	7	9	N	N	Carl Jung and the Essential Quest for the Inner Fatherland.	_The Aryan Christ:  The Secret Life of Carl Jung_ by psychologist Richard Noll is a book which attempts to situate the ideas of the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung within their historical milieu and also provide a more realistic account of the cult-like aspects of the Jungian movement and the negative (shadow) side of Jung's personality.  While I myself tend to look askance at psychoanalysis as a movement, believing that ultimately it may lead to narcissism and denial of sin, while at the same time attempting to undermine or replace religion (particularly Freudian psychoanalysis), I found this book in many ways to be profoundly unfair to Jung.  While it is certainly true that a dogmatic form of Jungianism is highly dangerous, nevertheless there is some truth in Jung's ideas and to dismiss them as merely the deranged fantasies of a hysteric or megalomaniac seems to undermine that truth.  Furthermore, Noll seems to have a profound animus towards anything German, particularly the sorts of ideas floating around in Germany prior to the rise of the Nazis.  This politically correct attempt to link anything Germanic and/or mystical with the Nazis is particularly reprehensible and rejects entirely the great traditions of a great and noble people.  In many ways, Jung's form of psychoanalysis may be regarded as the Aryan corrective to the Semitic form of psychoanalysis proliferated by Freud and his school.  Jung broke away from Freud and his reprehensible view of human nature to embrace the religious and spiritual in man.  Noll will attempt to explain this break as many dogmatic Freudians do as the result of the beginnings of psychosis and anti-Semitism in Jung.  However, this explanation is certainly unsatisfactory.  Freudianism is a dogmatic and harmful religion, which reduces the analyzed to a mere pawn of the analyst's whim (and reduces man to a mere being at the whim of his desires, totally ruled by his childhood developmental experiences and sex and death).  While Jungianism can be equally dogmatic and harmful if taken to its extreme, it nevertheless offers a necessary counter-active to the overzealous materialism of rampant Freudianism.  In addition, Noll will argue that Jung's central idea of the \\"collective unconscious\\" (and ancestral memory) is not scientific rooted in Lamarckianism and the ideas of the German romantic scientist Ernst Haeckel, and that Jung covered up evidence that casts doubt upon these ideas.  Noll will contend that the instances Jung finds of archetypal forms in his psychotic patients are merely cases of \\"cryptomnesia\\" and not proof of the collective unconscious.  However, the evidence is overwhelming, nearly all cultures exhibit similar mythological forms, and this is certainly a debatable point.  In doing this, Noll himself is promoting an entrenched form of Darwinianism and a biological materialism that rejects vitalism within the biological sciences.  This itself is merely a product of the times, and history will likely show (as indeed it has already shown) the inherent evils within the Darwinian materialistic worldview.  Furthermore, Noll will argue that Jung was fundamentally pagan, Gnostic, and anti-Christian (particularly in his opposition to the church and Roman Catholicism).  While there may be some truth in this based on his letters, the evidence is contradictory in that sometimes Jung appeals to Christian motifs in his writings while at others he rejects them.  Certainly much has been left out of his writings; however, there is little reason to suppose that a conspiracy exists to suppress the truth of his religious affiliations.    This book is rather cleverly organized into parts, each paralleling chapters within the Christian Bible, and each prefaced with a drawing of the Aryan (pagan sun-worshipping) artist Karl Hoppner (better known as Fidus).  The book includes the following parts:  \\"Genesis\\" (outlining the early life of Jung and the philosophical worldview which lies behind most of his writings), \\"Mysteria\\" (perhaps the most controversial aspect of this book, showing how Jung allegedly broke away from the Judeo-Christian worldview to embrace polygamy, paganism, sun-worship, Gnosticism, and ultimately self-deification as the Aryan Christ), \\"Acts of the Apostles\\" (an account of three of Jung's student-followers, filled with much salacious gossip and appalling behavior by Jung; perhaps the least interesting aspect of this book), and \\"Revelations\\" (showing how Jung's image was altered following the rise of Nazism so that he went from a \\"Volkish prophet\\" to a \\"wise old man\\").  For me, the most interesting sections of this book were the first two in that they outlined the sort of philosophical worldview which underlay Jung's intellectual development.  Jung's family was German Catholic until the time of his grandfather, Karl Gustave Jung, who participated in the radical romantic nationalist movement of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and as part of the Zeitgeist of the times left Catholicism for a form of Protestant Pietism.  Karl Gustave was arrested and had to flee to Switzerland, where he became involved in Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, and the Illuminati.  Jung himself was heavily influenced by these Germanic romantic ideas and mysticism and was forever to seek throughout his life the \\"inner fatherland\\" they provided.  As a young adult, Jung took an active interest in spiritualism and the occult and read avidly in philosophy and mysticism.  Jung also engaged in frequent spiritualistic activities and when he became a psychiatrist at the Burgholzli wrote his doctoral dissertation on spiritual mediums and hysteria attributing their powers to \\"cryptomnesia\\".  However, while maintaining a rationalistic outer self, inwardly Jung sought for a way to explain the spirits (which he was eventually to do through the archetypes or \\"gods\\" of the \\"collective unconscious\\").  (It should be noted that this contrast between Jung's outer and inner selves or \\"number 1\\" and \\"number 2\\" personalities has led many to conclude that he was a hysteric.  However, these served merely to develop Jung's own unique personal understanding of himself.)  While at the Burgholzli, Jung was to treat his fellow analyst Otto Gross for morphine addiction (later stated to be the dread \\"dementia praecox\\").  Gross was a bohemian eccentric who influenced by Freud, Nietzsche, and Bachofen argued that sexual morals must be cast aside and that polygamy must be embraced.  Jung took the advice of Gross and began recommending polygamy for his patients and later himself.  Jung also met Toni Wolff who was to remain his mistress for many years.  It was during this time that according to Noll, Jung became fully pagan and embraced sun worship.  Further, motivated by his readings in mythology concerning the Mithraic mystery cults, Jung induced trance and became self-deified (the Aryan Christ).  Noll's arguments for self-deification are particularly weak and should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt.  The next section is rather uninteresting to me (and appears to be little more than salacious scandal) detailing the lives of three of Jung's patients turned analysts.  The final section turns back to Jung arguing that his followers have attempted to whitewash his paganism, anti-Christianity, supposed anti-Semitism, and potential support for the Nazis.    This book is interesting in what it has to say about the philosophical ideas underlying the worldview of Carl Jung; however, it should not be embraced wholeheartedly given the author's extreme animosity towards his subject.  Unfortunately, the author dismisses so much of Jung's thought that it becomes difficult to make sense of what he is truly getting at.	2001-03-13

This book is a good introduction to some of the science fiction and science fact speculations concerning the possibility of time travel.  It considers time travel from early science fiction speculations (e.g. H. G. Wells' _Time Machine_) to modern science speculations involving quantum mechanics, faster-than-light tachyons, and wormholes.  From the classic speculations involving General Relativity of Kurt Godel and his rotating universe, to the modern speculations of Kip Thorne involving the use of wormholes to travel backwards in time, the science of time travel is made clear to the lay person.  Philosophical speculation with regards to the metaphysics of time is dealt with fully.  The apparent paradoxes of time travel (backwards in time) (e.g. the &quot;grandfather paradox&quot;) are considered and possible resolutions to them are proposed.  In the end, the reader is left to decide for himself whether time travel is: 1.  possible, and 2.  feasible (at whatever level of technological advancement).  According to Stephen Hawking, the fact that we haven't been visited by time travelling tourists is evidence against the possibility of backwards in time, time travel.  I myself do not believe this to be the case and think that there is some other reason for the apparent absence of time travellers.  For those of us who boldly wonder about the possibilities of man's future evolution, future technological progress, and future civilization, the issue of time travel is an unavoidable and a tempting one.  If man is to ever conquer the galaxy, he must conquer time first.  It must be possible - it will be possible!  This book is an appeal to dreamers and speculative philosophers to examine fully the issues, paradoxes, and proposed methods of time travel.	2001-03-09

The apocalyptic imagination has always exercised great control over the mind of the Western man - from bands of Jewish zealots in the time of Josephus to the masses of poor warriors in the Crusades to take the Holy Land for Christendom to the mutual hurling of the epithet &quot;Antichrist&quot; between Luther and the Pope, and it has been keenly expressed in the Biblical tradition within the Books of Daniel and Revelations.  _The Pursuit of the Millennium_ takes a look at the mass movements and delusions that developed out of this tradition in the Middle Ages and the period following the Middle Ages, the Reformation.  Norman Cohn shows how prejudices and hatreds among the poor (especially against the Jews, the clergy, and the wealthy) were used by mystical prophetae in conjunction with the apocalyptic tradition to give rise to mass movements which resulted in much mayhem and bloodshed.  For example, the People's and Shepherd's Crusades in the Middle Ages were movements of mindless zealotry which ended in mass slaughter.  Cohn examines various sects that developed out of these apocalyptic traditions around such figures as the Emperor Frederick, Joachim of Fiore, and various other individuals and imposters who sought to mobilize the masses of poor.  In the later Middle Ages, this type of movement was exemplified among the flagellants, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, Taborites and followers of Thomas Muntzer, the militant wing of the Anabaptists, and later the Ranters in England.  Often, these movements incorporated Joachimite speculations about a coming Age of the Spirit, mystical doctrines that made one was free to sin as one pleased (Free Spirit), and communistic ideals that involved belief in a Golden Age in which all men had lived as brothers with all things in common.  Class struggle between rich and poor, or between poor and clergy (who were often contaminated by the sins of Avaritia and Luxuria) developed into all out wars.  The belief that the apostles had lived in poverty and that God had intended all men to live in a communistic setting gave impetus to many individuals to reject church orthodoxy and form their own apocalyptic movements.  These movements depended on the poor who held steadfastly to their often megalomanical leaders in their pursuit of messianic ideals and the coming of the millennium.  Cohn does an excellent job of describing this process in detail and deals with much of the mysticism and myth surrounding it.<br />In the modern era, it is apparent that millenarian zeal has not died off at all.  The communist revolutions in Russia and the rise of the Third Reich in Germany were both movements in the same line as these earlier mass movements in the Middle Ages.  While they have shed much of the apocalyptic myth and become atheistic, the same principles were involved in their formation, and in the formation of similar movements that continue in the world today.	2001-03-04

While the existence of magical practices in earliest Christianity is without doubt, and the relationships between such ancient historical figures as Apollonius of Tyana, Simon Magus, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ could prove a subject for fruitful research, the methods used in this book are horrendously bad.  It would be the equivalent of a man who had a maniacal hatred for Platonists setting out to discover the &quot;historical Plato&quot;.  One can only imagine it.  First, he'd proclaim that anything the Platonists had to say about Plato cannot be of value because Plato was able to get his men into high places and therefore it's all Platonist propaganda.  Then, he'd turn to Plato's enemies and detractors and see what they had to say.  He'd comb the literature for anything - e.g. everything from criticisms of his beard, to calling him stupid, to calling him insane (and believe me, some of the criticisms of Jesus and his followers are just about this petty; they occur so often that there isn't much point in pointing them out in such a short review space).  Then, he'd claim that this collection of faults constitutes the historical Plato and not the Plato of faith.  And, he'd say that the only reason the Plato of faith exists at all is because the Platonists were able to exercise military control over everyone else (i.e. &quot;take over the Roman empire&quot;).  In this way, he'd argue that Plato was a charlatan, and that nothing his own followers say about him could possibly be true or even important.<br />I have to give this book two stars though rather than one, because it does contain a lot of information about magical practices especially in the ancient Near East.	2001-02-23

The daring and originality of the thesis alone merits five stars.  And, to show just how daring it is take a look at the controversy it has apparently generated.  Witness the dogmatic adherence by some to outmoded philosophies of science, logical positivism and Popperian falsificationism.  (Try reading a single philosophy of science textbook put out in recent times and come back to me as a logical positivist or Popperian and I'd be shocked.)  Or, witness the comments of one rabid political animal that this book could possibly, somehow (don't know how) be used to support a &quot;conservative agenda&quot; and therefore is &quot;proof of a conservative conspiracy&quot;.  Apparently anything that just doesn't smack of political correctness is also proof of a conservative conspiracy.  I think the reason this is, is because the book dares to criticize the almighty Marx.  I guess those of us lesser people who are interested in things like &quot;truth&quot; and not agendas are just missing out on the conspiracy.  Silly us.  It just goes to show that anything that doesn't support our pet projects is instantly damned.<br />That said, the thesis that primitive man was not conscious (at least not in the sense we understand it) until he learned how to use both halves of the bicameral brain in tandem via the corpus collosum is highly speculative.  But, so also is the thesis that the future will resemble the past or that the laws of nature apply uniformly throughout the universe.  By examining the writings of the ancient Greeks, the author is able to show at least that a different kind of consciousness existed among them than that that exists today.  Jaynes also examines the ancient Mesopotamians and Egyptians and provides an interesting discussion of how society developed from an authoritarian structure based on strict obedience to the gods (voices of command heard by primitive man) to the modern day civilization of conscious individuals we have today.  The development of ever larger civilizations basically forced (by a natural selection process) man to construct consciousness.  Authoritarian structures in the world today are explained as reversions to the bicameral mind (pre-conscious existence).  Just as primitive man constructed modern conscious man, so modern man will construct the higher man in the post-modern era.  Man will approach the limits of his possible experience without bound.  As we journey forth to colonize the galaxy in Dyson spheres and attain greater and greater levels of conscious awareness, we will recall the evolution of our consciousness as it occurred in ancient civilization.  Naive romanticism or mere belief in the power of the human spirit?<br />[Other heroes heralding in the triumph of the human individual include Nietzsche, Jung, and the Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin.]	2001-02-21

Like so many works of academic hubris put out these days, this book operates under the principle that if we soften the argument (appealing to premodern modes of explanation and &quot;feminine intuition&quot;, why intuition is feminine is beyond me, but apparently it's been decided that it is) then it will be easier to condemn from on high without it being apparent that we are actually condemning.  I haven't the time, energy, or desire to point out all the problems with this book, so I will give a few examples and then move on.  The author basically argues from a constructive postmodernist standpoint that certain practices by yogis are unethical because they result in a form of radical individualism that gives the yogi attributes normally attributed to the divine.  However, as far as I can tell, there is little basis provided for assuming that the constructive postmodernist standpoint is necessarily the superior one to use.  The author writes off many things as &quot;bad&quot;, but he never really defines precisely what these things are in themselves.  For instance, we are lead to believe that patriarchy is something to be avoided and that instead we should return to &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and respect the feminine principle in nature.  While I certainly cannot disagree with the last suggestion, it remains unclear exactly what is being condemned as patriarchy.  My understanding is that patriarchy means rule by males.  What I fail to understand though is why this MUST lead to the oppression of women.  Afterall, could there be a responsible patriarchy?  The same applies to technology.  For instance, in a particularly absurd sentence in this book, the author basically relies on the equation technology = exploitation to condemn virtually all mining.  As far as I can understand, the argument is that mining is offensive to Mother Earth.  This is a premodern form of explanation.  The Earth is not a goddess, as poetic and nicey nice as this may sound.  And, if the author really believes this, then this book is a testament to one man's religion and not a work of philosophy.  The real reason why mining is to be done responsibly (not condemned, unless of course the author wants to give up his computer which relies on silicon) is that it can be harmful to the environment around us.  It is this kind of obfuscation and abuse of metaphor which makes doubtful anything the author might say and veils his real intentions.  We are lead to believe that individualism is bad and that cooperation is good in the same manner.  Finally, another particular annoyance in this book is the author's repeated digs on the &quot;Religious Right&quot;.  I would hope to find this kind of unsubstantiated political pettiness absent from an academic work such as this.  To perceive the &quot;Religious Right&quot; (another term which is never defined) as a single homogenous body doing harm to society is roughly the liberal equivalent of the Red Scare (which the author happens to condemn in this book).  The author goes so far as to mention Jerry Falwell's arrogant (but off-handed) remark that God does not hear the prayers of the Jews.  I completely fail to see what the importance of this is, but I do think the author is guilty of misrepresenting the &quot;Religious Right&quot; if he is taking Falwell's singular remark as indicatory of their beliefs.  I also take issue with his use of the term &quot;Hebraizing principle&quot; to describe the discovery by the Hebrews that the single God is transcendent and apart from nature.  This totally disregards other primitive monotheisms (for instance, consider the beliefs of Akhenaton in Egypt or even the work _Man, God and Magic_ by Ivar Lissner (which unfortunately is virtually impossible to find), in which it is argued that primitive man was monotheistic and had discovered the transcendent God).  I like this better because it illustrates that man can discover God with just the use of the mind, and that he need not take recourseto the revelation of God as shown in the Bible to prove His existence.	2001-02-19

The basic premise of the book (&quot;essay&quot;) _Hamlet's Mill_ is that the myth of Hamlet (and its variants) and in general all the ancient myths can be interpreted as a code language expressing the astronomical knowledge of precession of the equinoxes among ancient cultures.  The idea is that the archetype of the &quot;mill&quot; represents the heavens above and that by a mixing of the mill is meant the stirring of the heavens.  The passing of the earth from the Age of Aries (the ram) to the Age of Pisces (the fish) in ancient times is determined to be a highly significant psychological event for &quot;primitive&quot; man.  It is imagined that primitive man, gazing up at the night sky, was completely and utterly mystified.  The paths of the stars and of those roaming stars - the planets - would have served as a source of astoundment for the primitive.  In this way, the science of astronomy veiled beneath its pseudo-scientific cousin astrology was given birth to.<br />The important thing to realize is that man's life here on earth is influenced much by psychological forces played out in the heavens.  And, by this is meant that the heavens (and what occurs up there) can serve as portents of imminent doom.  To the primitive, these astronomical occurrences must have given rise to indescribable emotions.  These serve as a guide in understanding the primitive mythologies.  Thus, myth is taken to be based on an astronomical (astrological) foundation.  And, with the heralding in of new world ages, the psyche of man is greatly affected.<br />Events taking place in the heavens served a special purpose to the primitive individual.  By following the paths of the stars and planets in the sky as they trace out their motions, primitive man was able to briefly observe a small cross-section of the workings of the entire universe.  By following along these lines, the primitive individual was capable of projecting the heavenly occurrences onto earthly matters.  In this manner, theheavens were mirrored by the daily, mundane earthly events, and this gave rise to myth.  To the ancients, the myth represented the corridor between man and the heavenly entities above.  By traveling through this corridor, man was enabled to observe the world as it really is, in all its mystery.<br />Consider the primitive stranded in a world in which he does not understand; in fact, one in which he is incapable of understanding, the daily flux of events as they unwind from the cosmic thread.  The playing out of these cosmic events was of enormous significance.  Imagine now gazing up at the night sky tens of thousands of years ago, awestruck with wonder.  Then, the cryptic message of that enormous cryptogram must play an enormous role in the lives of the ancient individual.  And, remember, that to the ancient, the primitive sky is available for all to observe (not just a select few).  But, it was only those select, initiated few who were fully aware of these cosmic events.<br />To the early Hebrew, the heavens were of especial significance.  To these people, the heavens marked the location of the Kingdom of God (the one God).  The advent of the monotheistic religion of the early Hebrew marked an enormous event in the history of mankind.  The philosophical significance of this realization of a single deity is immense.  By following along these lines, one can realize the great importance that the heavens must have had for the early diletante in monotheism.  These &quot;primitive&quot; individuals gave birth to one of the greatest motivating factors of the modern era.<br />To the ancient Hebrew, the word of the one God was recorded in the Torah, the Law of Moses.  This marked the beginning of the Age of Aries, as demonstrated in the classical scene with the worshipping of the golden calf.  This biblical scene illustrates the fall of the Age of Taurus and the progression into the Age of Aries.  The molten, golden calf is a representation of the bull, Taurus.  And, the God of Moses demands that those worshipping the calf must suffer for their misdeeds.<br />Later, the birth of Jesus Christ is signified by a brilliant star in the sky (the Star of Bethlehem).  What exactly this really is intended to be is obscure.  However, notice that Jesus Christ is represented by the fish (pisces) and so his era is associated with the Age of the Fish.  <br />To the ancients, the heavens represented a vast virtual playground upon which the course of history was plotted out.  The cryptological significance of this is mindboggling to the modern man, who views ancient man as primitive in both technological advancement and intelligence.  The idea that ancient man could have possessed a capable intellect full of the mirth of the intellectual (semiotical) cryptogram is anathema to the modern man.  The mere suggestion of this is considered absurd.  However, the question that the discerning modern individual must ask is how absurd is it and why should one not attempt to fully appreciate all the events and their significances that have lead up to the psychological and mental development of modern man.  Beneath the carpet of modern bias is an historical mystery of vast import awaiting a solution.  An attempted solution to this historical puzzle is presented here.	2001-02-19

In this work, Schelling examines philosophy as it existed in his time.  He begins with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, who he criticizes on several grounds and examines his ontological proof.  Then, he moves on to Spinoza, Leibniz and Christian Wolff.  Schelling looks at the &quot;Pantheism controversy&quot; surrounding Spinoza, and he rejects the philosophy of Leibniz, which he shows breaks into two parts, the monadology and that in the _Theodicy_.  All of whose work he examines and provides criticism.  Schelling next considers Kant and argues that he is misguided.  Finally, Schelling examines his contemporaries, Fichte and Hegel.  Schelling criticizes Fichte and his project of Idealism, and shows how this is doomed to failure.  He also provides a cogent criticism of Hegel.  Schelling also examines &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; as proposed by Fichte, and demonstrates how his own thought fits into this picture.  Lastly, Schelling examines Jacobi, who criticized the project of German Idealism, and Schelling shows the contradictions within his thought.  Throughout this work, Schelling reveals himself to be a monist, opposed to Cartesian dualism, argues against the flawed ontological proof, which he sees to be at the basis of Hegel's philosophy, and shows the need for a historically based metaphysics.  The work also includes a discussion of theosophy and mysticism (especially as shown in Jacob Boehme) which Schelling rejects, and a pretty funny chapter on the differences between national philosophies (i.e. why German philosophy is superior to French and English philosophy).<br />Overall this is an important work which demonstrates Schelling's thought.  It also is important for its criticism of Hegel, and the contrast between Schelling and Hegel's philosophy.  I should add finally, that the introduction by Bowie is excellent and provides a detailed explanation of all the important issues involved.	2001-01-22

In this work, Michael Gillespie attempts to find the roots of nihilism in European thought.  Unlike Nietzsche who argues that nihilism arises from the death of God, Gillespie contends that nihilism in fact comes from a new understanding of God, as omnipotent will.  Where does this new understanding come from?  Gillespie contends that it originated in the middle ages in the realist versus nominalist debates.  The medievals drew a distinction between God's power as &quot;potentia absoluta&quot; (absolute power) and &quot;potentia ordinata&quot; (ordered power).  The scholastics on the side of the realists contended that God would not supersede his potentia ordinata; however those who sided with the nominalists, such as William of Ockham, contended that God was indeed omnipotent so He could do as he pleased.  This debate came to a head, and was played out during the Reformation.  Thus, the nominalists presented a new understanding of God, and it is precisely here where nihilism originated.<br />Gillespie argues that in the thought of Descartes (and in his near omnipotent &quot;evil genius&quot;, deceiver God) modern philosophy began and nominalism triumphed.  However, the omnipotent God of will was too frightening for Descartes so he created a bastion (based on &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;) for reason and man's freedom.  Gillespie traces this development through time as it arrives in the hands of Fichte and his absolute I.  Fichte was attacked as a nihilist by Jacobi because his philosophy was one of appearances (&quot;and therefore of nothing&quot;).  Nihilism then was developed by the German Romantics.  Gillespie uses Blake's poem &quot;Tyger&quot; and the Romantic heroes Manfred and Faust to illustrate the rise of &quot;the demonic&quot;, the omnipotent God of will.  Gillespie then considers the thought of Hegel and it's development by the Left Hegelians.  Next, Gillespie turns his attention to the Russian nihilists, and their political revolution (an overturning of values).  Finally, Gillespie considers Nietzsche himself, his concept of the Dionysian (as opposed to the &quot;Crucified&quot;), his relationship to Schopenhauer and thereby Fichte (as Gillespie states, &quot;his reversal of Schopenhauer was a reversal of Schopenhauer's reversal of Fichte that brought him full circle back to Fichte&quot;).  Finally, Gillespie considers the importance of understanding nihilism for the modern world.<br />Overall this is a very well written and profound book, which takes a seriously look at the history of nihilism and how that history has played out in the modern world.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.	2001-01-20

Stanislav Grof is up to no good again.  In this book, he takes a look at some of the bizarre states that can result using his holotropic breathing techniques (here he doesn't need LSD, like he has used for therapy in the past).  He categorizes these states into systems of condensed experience (COEX), basic perinatal matrices (BPM I-IV), and other transpersonal states.  As in his other works, Grof believes that the individual can be regressed to birth and beyond, so as to reexperience the birth trauma and resolve all neuroses which result from it.  (I personally have a hard time buying that this actually occurs.)  The explanation of the transpersonal states is exceedingly bizarre, and includes everything from cosmic consciousness to the appearance of UFO's.  Add to this a blend of Eastern mysticism, existential philosophy, Jungian psychology and virtually any other strange or far-fetched system for understanding the world, and you have this book.	2001-01-20

The drug is available only for research purposes, and as I'm sure you can imagine, there is a lot of red tape involved.  So, that is the basic problem that scientists who are interested in LSD are facing.  Half of the book is devoted to what I'd call the history of psychedelic drug use, and the other half to the effects of psychedelic drugs, with some of the legalities involved thrown in for good measure.  As far as the history goes, there is good reason to believe that psychedelic drugs have been around for a long time, and will continue to be used for a long time.  And, as far as the effects of these drugs are concerned . . . well here we get to the &quot;good stuff&quot;.  First, I think the book is somewhat dangerous, because despite what you may have been told, LSD is not a panacea.  Some psychiatrists (such as Stanislav Grof) will have you believe that the drug can regress you to the time of your birth, allowing you to resolve all the existential issues in your life, and then possibly regress you further into other &quot;far out&quot; realms . . . where there's just no law and order, man (e.g. imagine you consciously identifying with the sperm cell that was you, this kind of nonsense is abundant in Grof's work, see his _LSD Psychotherapy_).  Nevertheless the effects of the drug are profound and religiomimetic.  I'm really unable to speak about a lot of this stuff because I've never taken the drug (thank God), and have never really seen anyone else under the influence of it.  And, my suspicion is that while the drugs do induce genuine experiences, they aren't as meaningful as &quot;genuine religious experiences&quot; (whatever that might mean).  So, I tend to side with Mircea Eliade and the Catholic scholar, R. C. Zaechner.  Nevertheless it is clear to me at least that much is yet to be learned from these drugs and that further &quot;controlled&quot; research needs to be done.  In any event, the stuff makes for fascinating reading, and it raises a lot of philosophical questions.t; (whatever that might mean).

This book is a fascinating and terrifying account of the history, purpose, and powers of the National Security Agency (NSA).  The book traces the origins of this superorganization from the Black Chamber to the form it took during the Cold War era.  (The book was written in 1982 so it does not discuss more modern developments.)  The book takes you inside the NSA and examines its anatomy and organization, its requirements for entry, and much else.  In the process it tells some fascinating stories of spies and double agents (which in itself is worth the read).  Also, the book examines the culture of the NSA and its use of developments within linguistics and cryptography.  (I read this book when I was in college and majoring in mathematics, so I was completely fascinated by this aspect of the organization.)  But, perhaps the most terrifying aspect of the book (besides the fact that the NSA is watching you) is that the NSA is &quot;above the law&quot;.  In fact, the author writes, &quot;Three decades after its creation, the NSA is still without a formal, statutory charter, the first reform called for by the Church Committee.  Instead, there is a super hush-hush surveillance court that is virtually impotent; the FISA, which has enough loopholes and exceptions to render it nearly useless; and an executive order that was designed more to protect the intelligence community from the citizens than the citizens from the intelligence community.  (p. 475)&quot;<br />The book does its best to give a clear picture of the NSA as it exists, and provides an introduction to the intelligence community and the world of classified information.	2001-01-19

Stanislav Grof is one of the pioneers in using LSD for psychotherapeutic research.  Personally, I'm not sure I buy it, but I read these books more for personal amusement than for any scientific content they may have.  (I give this book five stars because it's interesting, not for it's scientific content, which I believe to be virtually nil.)  In this book, Grof has thrown together some of the most bizarre and far-fetched speculative nonsense in an attempt to explain a hodge-podge of LSD experiences.  Grof gives a detailed picture of the various forms of therapy including, psycholitic therapy, psychedelic therapy, hypnodelic therapy, and his own holotropic therapy (which is basically hyperventilation and doesn't require LSD).  Grof then goes on to explain the effects of LSD.  Here, he concocts a bewildering schemata of various LSD induced states, which fit under various matrices:  COEX systems (systems of condensed experiences) and basic perinatal matrices (BPM I-IV).  This is where things get a little hocky, because according to Grof (and he gets this from Otto Rank) we can regress the individual to birth and then resolve various aspects of the birth trauma, freeing the individual of various neuroses, etc.  He throws in a mix of eastern philosophy and mysticism to explain various aspects of this regression process.  Apparently, one can go beyond even this level, into that of transpersonal experiences (here essentially all hell breaks loose and virtually anything goes).  The rest of the book is pretty much devoted to explaining various aspects of the therapy sessions, the effects of various environments, stimuli, etc. on the sessions, and much anecdotal evidence of alleged cures, resolutions of conflicts, breakdown of neurotic defense systems, etc.  I haven't made up my mind how much of this I buy into, and I don't see any easy way to do so without more research being done.  The book concludes with an appendix on the effects of LSD on chromosomes.	2001-01-19

Ayer (of logical positivism fame) offers a biography of the eccentric philosophical genius Ludwig Wittgenstein.  The author begins with a chapter providing a complete biographical sketch of Wittgenstein, and does not spare us any of his eccentricities.  The author traces the life of this individual from his early interest in aeronautics and mathematics to his study at Cambridge under Bertrand Russell to the development of his own thought.  Ayer explains how Wittgenstein believed himself to have addressed all philosophical questions in his Tractatus (and mentions the debt W. owes to Schopenhauer, and thereby Kant), and then the period in which W. left philosophy and became a gardener, nearly a monk, and a school teacher.  Ayer then deals with the later Wittgenstein, his thoughts on psychology, the foundations of mathematics, language games, and religion.  Ayer concludes that Wittgenstein is to be ranked only behind Russell as the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century.<br />Overall this book provides much of interest in the philosophical thought of Wittgenstein, and also gives many anecdotes of his nearly manic disposition and uncanny character.  An important biography of a truly great philosopher.	2001-01-19

Robert Anton Wilson - yeah that's right the same screwball &quot;psychologist&quot; who brought us that &quot;masterpiece&quot; of scientifantasy _The Illuminatus Triology_ - is up to no good again.  This time the guy is throwing a hissy because &quot;skeptics&quot; like Martin Gardner are just taking all the fun out of life with their die hard &quot;fundamentalist&quot; materialism.  Afterall, which sounds more cool:  &quot;flying saucer containing aliens from another dimension&quot;, or &quot;anomalous cloud formation&quot;.  In the process of showing us that the &quot;scientific community of today&quot; is starting to resemble more and more the Catholic Church of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Wilson is going to cite virtually a hundred million examples of unexplainable weirdness, a la Charles Fort.  To say that citing newspaper clipping after newspaper clipping of &quot;rains of frogs&quot;, werewolves, cats with wings, and other nonsense is tedious is a complete understatement.  In fact, it is outright absurd.  But, Wilson is going to do it anyway, just to make his point.  He's also going to quote a lot of philosophers from Hume to Nietzsche, with some Bergsonian &quot;creative evolution&quot; thrown into the mix for good measure.  And, he's also going to go off about the Copenhagen interpretation, Schrodinger's cat, Bell's Theorem, and all that quantum rigamarole.  He shows us some cool tricks, some optical illusions, and makes us take a neato test to find a way around the &quot;Aristotelian either/or game&quot;.  What's his answer to this menacing fundamentalist materialism he sees on the rise (watch out CSICOP)?  Creative agnosticism.  That's right, he can't explain it, so he just doesn't know.<br />Overall this is a pretty funny read.  Though, like I said, the plethora of absurd examples makes it extremely dull at points.  It has everything from the &quot;killer rabbit&quot; that attacked President Carter to the Travis Walton affair.  And, of course, Wilhelm Reich, Wilson's favorite Promethean hero whose books were burned by the government, gets mentioned.  Afterall, maybe he did really create a rain storm with orgasm energy.	2001-01-19

Propaganda is a relatively recent phenomenon made possible by the channels of the mass media.  In this work, Jacques Ellul analyzes propaganda in all its forms.  He argues that propaganda is indeed effective, that it is indeed necessary, that it is indeed harmful to democracy, and that it need not be based on lies.  It is precisely at this point that the dangers of propaganda become appparent because often the propaganda released is truthful in content.  Propaganda is also necessary even for a government which claims to be a democracy (and yes the United States does engage in it on its citizens).  Ellul examines the history of propaganda as it was used by Joseph Goebbels in Nazi Germany, Lenin and Stalin among the communists, and in the United States.  In an appendix, he deals with scientific studies which have aimed at measuring propaganda's effectiveness, and with the propaganda of Mao in China (which includes the topic of &quot;brainwashing&quot;, unfortunately not very developed in the text).  He also discusses propaganda as put out by churches and concludes that a true Christianity cannot rely on propaganda.  Also, the relation between propaganda and advertising is examined.<br />Overall this work is a thorough study of propaganda, although I wish that it had gone into further detail on the subject of &quot;brainwashing&quot;.	2001-01-06

This work is an examination of Heidegger's thinking about death and its relationship to the questioning of being.  The book looks at Heidegger's early thought in _Sein und Zeit_, with his notion of an authentic being-unto-death as an existential modality for man through the &quot;turning&quot; in his thinking to his mature thought.  I found the section of the book which deals with &quot;being-in-death&quot; and Heidegger's thought as it relates to an &quot;after-death&quot; to be particularly interesting.  Heidegger takes no position on the possibility of a &quot;being-in-death&quot;, but this work examines some of the thinking around this issue.  Overall this is a good introduction to both Heidegger's early and later thought and a good discussion of the philosophical issue of death.	2000-11-21

In this essay, the relationship of Heidegger's thought on Being to the theological issue of the existence of God is explored.  In _Being and Time_, Heidegger lays the foundations for metaphysical thinking (which also concerns the existence of God).  But, first he must show that metaphysics is indeed possible, following Kant.  When asking &quot;Why is there something rather than nothing?&quot; (as he does in his _Introduction to Metaphysics_), Heidegger does not intend this to be answered with &quot;God&quot;, as is done in medieval philosophy, i.e. he does not intend to search for the divine ground of Being.  Rather, &quot;His 'why' asks for the deepest and most fundamental ground of Being; for this reason the questioning does not begin with a given aggregate of beings and asks about a higher kind of being which accounts for their totality.  (18, this book)&quot;  After concerning itself with the foundations for metaphysics, the book turns to Heidegger's &quot;overcoming of metaphysics&quot; in his thinking.  The book deals with this overcoming, and with Heidegger's overcoming of theology.  Finally, the book looks at Heidegger's thought after his &quot;Kehre&quot; (turning)and deals with the relationship between the poet (viz. Holderlin) and the thinker (viz. Heidegger).  In conclusion, the author notes that Heidegger has made no decision on God.  He writes, &quot;Heidegger does not feel himself qualified; he experiences Beings as holy . . . but he has not been claimed by the god, i.e. he has not experienced god.

It deals with Heidegger's thought from _Being and Time_ to his later &quot;overcoming&quot; of philosophy in his thinking.  The book explains how Heidegger achieved his concept of authenticity (especially that expressed in B&amp;T) from the works of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.  Further, Heidegger's relationships to National Socialism and the application of his ideas to theology are explored.  The author begins with the early Heidegger, who began as a Catholic theologian, as he explains the relationship of Heidegger's authenticity in B&amp;T to religion.  The author then explores Heidegger's notion of &quot;everydayness&quot; and how this relates to inauthentic existence.  In addition, Heidegger's notion of an authentic &quot;being-towards-death&quot; is looked at.  &quot;World historical heroism&quot; is examined as revealed through Nietzsche's character of the Overman, and Heidegger's political activities in the Nazi party are explained in terms of &quot;voluntarism&quot;.  The role of technology and its relationship to inauthentic ways of being is dealt with.  Finally, Heidegger's late thought is examined through the concept of &quot;Ereignis&quot; and &quot;releasement&quot;.  This is related to the Zen mysticism and the Christian mysticism of Meister Eckhart.	2000-11-10

This work is Etienne Gilson's examination of Christian philosophy as it appeared in medieval times, especially as revealed in the thoughts of St. Thomas Aquinas.  The main thesis for this book is that Christian philosophy is indeed a coherent concept and indeed prevailed in the middle ages.  The book, a series of lectures given by Gilson, is divided into two halves.  The first half deals with metaphysics and anthropology as seen from the Christian perspective (particularly questions concerning God and the concept of a person).  The second half deals with the Christian noetic and ethics.  The major Christian philosophers dealt with include especially St. Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, St. Augustine, Boethius, St. Bonaventure, and St. Anselm.  The relationship (and possible conflict) between medieval Thomism and Augustinism is fully dealt with.<br />In the first part of this book, the Christian metaphysics is expolored.  In particular, God is taken to be Being itself, which is necessarily.  Other beings are seen to be contigent.  The glory of God as expressed in the work of St. Thomas Aquinas is examined.  Finally, the idea of a Christian anthropology and Christian thinking about the person is dealt with.<br />In the second half of this book, the Christian philosopher's explanation for how things come to be known is explained.  Also, the proper objects of the intellect and love as known to the medieval scholastics is examined.  In addition, the issue of free will and divine providence and their relations are dealt with.  The author next explores Christian law and ethics as seen by the medievals.  Finally, the notions of history and nature as experienced by the medieval Christian philosophers are discussed.<br />In sum, this book constitutes an excellent introduction to Christian philosophy in the middle ages.  Etienne Gilson is a Catholic scholar and has written on Thomas Aquinas and Descartes elsewhere.  The book fully examines all the issues and makes a convincing argument for the existence of a Christian philosophy during the middle ages.  Through the eyes of the medieval scholastic, man is given a vision of God that endures for all time!	2000-11-10

The history of the world is the history of secret societies.<br />This book is an historical essay on the Order of the Knights Templar, their trial and execution, and the subsequent myth that developed about them.  The Knights Templar were a religious militant order which was founded during the middle ages to contribute to the Crusades.  They took vows of &quot;poverty, chastity, and obedience&quot;, and lived as monk-soldiers.  However, these warrior-monks amassed a great deal of wealth, which likely prompted the jealousy of King Philip the Fair.  They were charged with heresy and various other crimes (including bizarre sexual practices and the worship of an idol, Baphomet), and were subsequently tried and murdered.  Whether or not the Templars were indeed the heretics they were presented to be, or whether they were framed by King Philip, is a question that history has come to inquire.  Because of the bizarreness of the accusations (and later the confessions) made against (by) the Templars, their cause has been taken up by many writers of myth and history since their trial.  Further, many secret societies and masonic organizations claim them as their antecedants.  This book deals with the history of the Templars and this myth which they have given rise to.<br />The book is an excellent introduction to the Templars and their myth.  It has everything from the death cries of Jacques de Molay, the Templar Grand Master at the time of their execution, to the bizarre theorizings of individuals ranging from the infamous Bavarian Illuminati (founded by Adam Weishaupt) to Joseph Hammer (who wrote _The Mystery of Baphomet Revealed_) to Aleister Crowley and his role in the O.T.O. and the Order of the Golden Dawn.  One cannot find a better short book which discusses all the bizarre and hysterical beliefs that have arisen out of the Templar myth.  But, not only this!  The book also deals with the genuine history of these knights, who were taken to be heretical magicians by theirinquisitors.  It is excellent in both respects!	2000-11-10

The book considers the three interpretive modes of anagogy, teleology, and geneaology, which have been used by exegetes of the Book of Revelations.  Anagogy views the text as a work expressing timeless propositions of the Christian spirit.  Teleology views the text as a genuine prophecy of things to come.  And, the geneaological perspective traces the lines of descent in the text from their original sources.  The author examines the history of each of these interpretive modes, and then turns to the Book of Revelations itself to provide his own exegesis.  The author uncovers the hidden astrological underpinning of the Book of Revelations, and shows how John wrote the book as a reply to astrology from the Christian perspective.  The book concludes with a discussion of Revelations in light of Jung's &quot;Answer to Job&quot;.  Overall, this is an excellent introduction to the Book of Revelations, and its interpretors.	2000-10-21

The topics dealt with include  nuclearism and nuclear war, the Holocaust, cults, suicide, and the Vietnam  War.  The author is concerned with how the &quot;survivor&quot; of such an  attrocity, either as the persecuted or the persecutor (or somewhere in  between), is able to link up with their former self and visualize a  meaningful existence afterwards.  The author understands immortality to be  that sense of connectedness with others, with history, and with the great  chain of being, that all individuals experience.  And, the author questions  how there can remain a sense of immortality given some of the horrors that  have occurred and continue to occur (in the form of nuclear weapons). The  author takes a definite anti-nuclear stance in the book, and he repeatedly  stresses the importance of avoiding falling into the illusion that  stockpiling nuclear weapons is the only way out of our current nuclear  dilemma.  The author also includes essays on the Holocaust, in particular  on the Nazi doctors who contributed at Auschwitz.  Here the author explains  how these doctors came to confuse the roles of healing and killing, a  slippery slope which is all too easy to slide down.  In addition, the  author discusses those Vietnam veterans who came home from the war with a  profound sense of futility.  Rather than seeing the war as meaningful, they  came to feel that they were fighting in a war with no real purpose.  The  author discusses his sessions with various veterans and how they dealt with  their ambivalent emotions towards the war.	2000-08-19

It is the best way I can think of to orient oneself to Catholic issues, and the history of the Roman Catholic  church which has played such an important part in the history of western  civilization (and world history).  The book doesn't cover early  Christianity as well as I would have liked, but there are other books which  do this better.  It is excellent on some of the medieval and modern  political/theological issues which have besieged the church, and it shows  how through all of this the church has managed to uphold the faith of its  people up to the modern era.  One cannot help but see the presence of God  in all of this.	2000-06-30

It presents a model, using catastrophe theory, in which the person is driven  to a snapping point.  After this snap, the personality is drastically  changed, and often it requires another snap to rectify the situation.  The  theory presented here is very interesting.  The cases discussed include  those annoying cults and &quot;self help&quot; groups which roam college  campuses (and its good to see that the authors do not bend to political  correctness and include some of the more popular groups).  In addition, the  effects of stress are discussed in industrial settings.  And, the  governments royal botch-job at Waco is examined.  Personally, I consider  some of the &quot;cult deprogrammers&quot; as heroes who have tried to  uphold a person's fundamental right to freedom of thought, against the sway  of politicians.  The only problem I have with this book is that there never  is made a distinction between genuine religious conversion and cult  conversion (snapping).  I do not know how such a distinction could be made,  but perhaps it would be an interesting area for further research.	2000-06-30

That said, the book is a collection of short essays by various  individuals with a postmodern bent to it.  The book relies on &quot;fantasy  theory&quot; to explore the profuse collection of folklore and wisdom that  is the Bible.  The book earns five stars simply out of the bizarreness of  topics presented, and originality of ideas.<br />For instance, one of the  articles (Ezekiel's Axl) begins, &quot;What if Axl Rose, tempermental  singer from the heavy metal band Guns n' Roses, and Ezekiel, eccentric  prophet from the Hebrew Bible, were to be compared with each other?&quot;   The reader can only stammer out . . . Dude man you've gotta be flipping me.   One can only imagine the scene, some guy is sitting around reading the  Book of (no doubt manic depressive but divinely inspired) Ezekiel one day  and listening to (equally manic depressive and divinely inspired) Axl Rose  as screaches out something to the effect of &quot;Take me down to the  Paradise City . . . &quot;, when suddenly it occurs to him Paradise City =  Kingdom of God.<br />Several of the essays deal with common heresies, e.g.  Jesus set Judas up to do him in (its all part of the divine conspiracy errr  . . . plan), etc.  And the more interesting ones deal with blasphemy,  gnosticism, and the future of civilization.  The final essay deals with the  works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (one of the other science  fiction writers who started his own religion besides Hubbard), and it  explores his relationship with the early Gnostics.  I must say that this  essay reinvigorated my interest in Dick, who I had read intently in my  youth, esp. VALIS, and is a good introduction to the man for those who look  forward to learning about his bizarre ideas.	2000-03-14

If this book shows anything, it shows that it is impossible to make sense of postmodern thinkers from Foucault, Lyotard, and Baudrillard, as well as  members of the Frankfurt school (viz. Habermas), in a one shot deal.  These  thinkers are very complicated to sort out . . . and the reader is left half  wondering how much if any of this stuff/garbage/inspired works of genius  should he take seriously.  Even the authors admit as much.  And, while  their blatantly ultraliberal political opinions shine through the entire  work, at the end (the last five or so pages) they wrap things up kind of  nicely.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to give this book the full five  good rating to any book that tries, 2.  I kinda think they did a good job  of sorting through this complicated mess (at least as good a job as is  possible), and 3.  my rating system requires that I give them the full five  stars.  So, there ya go.<br />So here's my advice.  If you're sitting around  one day and find yourself wondering just what exactly has been popular in  the French intellectual scene during the past twenty or so years, then  maybe you should pick up this book and find out for yourself.  Or if you're  wondering just who is this Foucault character and why should or shouldn't I  forget him, then again you might want to check this book out.

I guess I'm taking the advice on the  cover of the book, which among other things says, Who laughs last?  Ha ha!	2000-03-03
US	50058656	R2828DLLPAGL13	0820433543	745950427	Witchcraft. Lycanthropy. Drugs and Disease (American University Studies)	Books	5	5	9	N	N	Does the title not say it all?	If you're into everything from schizophrenia to ergot poisoning, from the black plague to the dread Malleus Maleficarum, from the &quot;thumb screws&quot; method of torture to The Devils of Loudon and demonic  possession, then this is the book for you.  Add to that a collection of  pictures that would shock any uncouth European peasant living in the  sixteenth century, and you've got the making of a most bizarre book in the  most bizarre field of &quot;witchcraft studies&quot;.  Here you get to see  the shear ugliness of life in medieval Europe during the Inquisition up  close and personal.  You get to look into the mind of the &quot;witch  hammerer&quot; as he singles out those members of society that alleged  performed those sinister magical acts that included cannibalism, sexual  contact with demons, and spreading plague and disease.  Rather than arguing  that &quot;witchcraft was real to the people of the time so it was  real&quot; like other &quot;mentalist&quot; anthropologists in the field  have done, the author condemns those who insisted on the existence of  witchcraft and argues that it was used an excuse to persecute and  mercilessly torture thousands.  As far as lycanthropy goes, the author  suggests that the mentally ill, social outcasts, and those infected with  rabies may have been those persecuted as &quot;werewolves&quot;.  The  pictures and bizarreness of the topic alone earns the book five stars, and  while there are parts of it that I'm not sure that I can agree with (for  instance, the author believes that cannibalism has never been a socially  acceptable practice to any great extent in any culture whatsoever) the  author does an excellent job of revealing the pernicious delusions which  plagued the European mind during the time.	2000-02-29

Another one of my depressive Christmas break reads . . . a monotonous drone:  laziness and narcissism are the root of all the world's ills, laziness and narcissism, laziness and narcissism, laziness and narcissism,  . . . ad nauseum.  (But what exactly are &quot;laziness and  narcissism&quot;?  I suppose to answer that I'd have to break down and buy  his bestseller The Road Less Travelled, but  . . . after reading this  &quot;gem&quot;, gasp . . . I'm not sure I have the stomach for it.)<br />Is  it just me, or are the people he describes in this book not really  &quot;evil&quot; (whatever that word means)?  I mean to me they seem maybe  ignorant, innocent, lackluster, overly whimsical, intolerant, hypomanic,  disturbed, or gasp . . . even mentally ill.  And as far as his diagnostic  criteria for evil go, I mean who doesn't exhibit a &quot;schizophrenic  type&quot; of thinking under extreme stress?  This book reads like a  bad-case of psychological burn-out.  The author seems to be constantly  re-iterating just how &quot;oh-so-very-awful&quot; it all is, but (at least  the way I see it) he fails to deliver the goods.  He's constantly  (bordering on alcoholism) &quot;having a drink&quot; after his  &quot;evil&quot; patients leave his office.  But, he never seems to be  expressing exactly what that elusive evil quality about those patients is  precisely.  (Apparently only his &quot;overly attuned&quot; intuition can  discern the truly evil, from the other mentally ill and disturbed patients  that he has.)  The first half of the book seems to be building up to the  case of that poor girl Charlene (who gets the big EVIL label, with a  capital &quot;E&quot;, but who never causes anyone any real harm, just sort  of annoys the hell out of Peck), and the exorcisms.  These exorcisms are  not really explained, we're just given the impression that they are  &quot;highly personal&quot;, ghastly, horrendous, things we don't want to  talk about . . . but what exactly went on . .. we'll never know because  Peck will not tell (he just wants a drink badly at this point).  (Perhaps  an overzealous psychiatrist was contributing to the delusions of a  schizophrenic patient . . . perish the thought!)  The second half of the  book is his commentary on &quot;group evils&quot;.  Again, the Mylai  massacre - you guessed it, chalk it up to that doubly devilish combo  &quot;laziness and narcissism&quot;.  And, his suggestion that military  service should be mandatory . . . well it just rubs me the wrong  way.<br />But, I'll give this book two stars anyway, because at least he's  trying.  And, besides I only reserve the one star rating for outright smut.	2000-02-16

I read this book while pretty depressed, so I really experienced the full &quot;existential terror&quot; of it.  Then, I put it aside, became &quot;undepressed&quot; and started thinking about it  again.  This review is the result of my post-depressive thoughts and not my  quasi-delusional depressive thoughts.<br />This book is kind of like  &quot;philosophy-lite&quot;.  Don't read this book for the  &quot;philosophy&quot; (whatever that sinister word means) in it, but for  Kaufman's quirky opinions about the &quot;great[ly confused] men&quot; who  made philosophy what it is (or isn't) today.  For those of you who haven't  figured it out yet, Kaufman has this sort of love/hate relationship with  theologians.  He loves Nietzsche (K. helped translate his Will to Power)  (not a Nazi, contrary to popular opinion); he hates Heidegger (a Nazi thug,  again contrary to popular opinion) (and just look at the way he slighted  his poor friend/mentor Husserl, who coincidentally is never mentioned in  the book).  He loves Hegel and Wittgenstein (great German thinkers); he  hates that low life apologetic Protestant Tillich.  He thinks nothing but  bad thoughts about Kierkegaard; but he considers Socrates to be the  archetypal philosopher.  He admires the Jewish rabbinical tradition; he  despises that damnable St. Thomas Aquinas (whose views caused the bloody  Catholic Inquisition).  He looks up to &quot;big daddy&quot; Freud; he  loathes that mystico-religious pseudointellectual Jung (and that  disoriented nonsensical babbler Fromm for that matter too).  He's a closet  Satanist and he worships at the feet of that demoniac succubus, the goddess  Reason; while he spurns the angelic lady Faith.  [I should add that I don't  consider these remarks as not in keeping with the spirit of K., afterall as  he wonders all too often, Why can't those silly philosophers burst out in  laughter.]<br />Seriously though, here's the basic gist of his argument (or  whateverit is this book is presenting):  religion is submission to  authority, and faith is wishful thinking.  That said, I must admit that I  enjoyed his Buddhist story about the &quot;things that are dear to  one&quot;, near the end of the book; but I didn't so much like his analysis  of it.  Furthermore, I should add that its all supposed to be &quot;very  deep&quot;.<br />The author of this review takes no responsibility for the  psychological harm this book may inflict upon the reader.  (Just because I  give it five stars doesn't mean I recommend it!  It just means that its two  stars above Oprah's book of the month.)	2000-02-16
US	50058656	RB0Z65K2M868V	0801436117	630368907	Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of Religion)	Books	5	75	90	N	N	Only for the brave!	Marilyn McCord Adams takes on some of the ugliest theologico-philosophical tangles known to man - and does so very courageously.  The fundamental dilemma, Does the believer in God commit himself to a logically untenable  position when he posits the existence of an all-good, all-knowing, and  all-powerful deity, and yet acknowledges the presence of evil in the world?  I.e. is there a possible world in which such a situation manifests itself?  Of course, these issues have been debated to death by analytical  philosophers (and some have concluded that believing in such a God is  inconsistent with the existence of evil).<br />Dr. Adams moves away from the  traditional formulations of this question within analytic circles, which  makes use of the utilitarian pain/pleasure calculus type approach to  morality (championed by philosophers such as Bentham and Mills).  Instead,  she offers alternative approaches by examining the works of various  theologians throughout the ages.  Among the approaches considered are  purity/defilement (cf. Rudolph Otto, The Idea of the Holy), the honor code,  and aesthetics.  She examines the most horrible of horrors encountered by  man, and uses them to show how her God can overcome these horrors despite  their apparent intractibility.  Among some of the more interesting ideas  suggested are the notion that God indeed suffers along with us humans and  that even Christ (as God) had to experience abandonment by God, in order to  fully participate in the human condition (even though these have been  originally suggested by others).<br />While I will not comment on the validity  of her arguments (I think the difficulties are too great for me), I do  think that she offers profound insight into the nature of God (whatever  such an entity might be).  It is nice to know that someone still has faith  in an all-loving merciful deity, despite the fact that we live in a  post-consumerist, post-industrial, post-Marxist, post-Auschwitz world.	2000-02-16
US	50058656	R2AD84BVP756C1	0140135375	475009351	The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness (Penguin Psychology)	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Inside the world of the psychotic	This is Ronald Laing's brilliant first work, written by the eminent psychiatrist at the tender young age of 28.  I must say that it contains one of the most eloquent and compassionate descriptions of the process by  which an individual retreats from the world of consensual experience and  enters the fantastic world of psychosis.  Laing provides a detailed theory  of this process in his dichotomy between the &quot;false&quot; and  &quot;real&quot; selves (based on the existentialist notions of inauthentic  and authentic existence, respectively).  (Laing explains that the  &quot;false self&quot; is best thought of as a &quot;system of false  selves&quot;.)  Beginning with the eccentric neurotic and  &quot;schizoid&quot; individuals, Laing explains how these individuals,  from a sense of ontological insecurity, progress into the schizophrenic  stage of acute psychosis.  He harvests the profound insights of existential  philosophers (Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, et al) and  applies them to his psychoanalysis.<br />While I find his explanations of the  schizoid individual pretty compelling, they become more and more difficult  to follow as he approaches the schizophrenic stage.  (In fact, the last  case presented in his book of chronic schizophrenia, &quot;The Ghost of the  Weed Garden&quot;, is downright depressing, and his idea of the  schizophrenogenic family (as opposed to schizophrenogenic mother) of this  girl seems somewhat unfair to the family members of this chronically  psychotic individual.) Most people today would agree that schizophrenia (or  &quot;the schizophrenias&quot;, whatever the disease/s is/are) is best  explained in terms of physiology; however, Laing offers an excellent  existential analysis of the &quot;illness&quot; and provides insight into  the unique perspectives of the borderline psychotic and psychotic  individuals.<br />All in all, this is a beautiful exposition of the  schizoid/schizophrenic mode of being-in-the-world.	2000-02-15
