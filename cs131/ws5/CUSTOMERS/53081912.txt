I guess that singers/songwriters carry over their writing skills to the pages, because I know Gloria writes some of her own music and it's another form of story telling.  Therefore this book is great and being a mother herself, I guess she knew exactly the kind of stories young children love to hear.  I have read this to a little cousin of mine and he was enthralled the whole way through.  Noelle is a cute little character (that is actually one of her real dogs) and it tells a story of all these things that happen to her very interestingly.  The real message is really about the dog having a hard time fitting in and it's a metaphor for kids feeling left out and not included and different.  My cousin also loved all the colors and pictures.  This is a great book that I really recommend parents to read to their kids (and enjoy yourself too).	2005-10-11

It's a great book but very different to his first (Midnight ..) Again, there are some very interesting characters, both books are about trials and both so well written.  I hope he doesn't take 10 or more years to write another.  Reading about the city of Venice really made me want to go and visit (just like I want to still visit Savanah) but I love his descriptions and style of writing in general, and this will have you hooked from beginning to end.  Go get a copy today.	2005-10-03

There are some very enticing things to make here.  The photography is amazing and makes it all seem so delicious.  I'm just hoping that my copies look this good.  I've tried two things already with not bad results.   The only problem I have with a book like this (all cookbooks), is that sometimes some recipes are tricky.  So far I haven't come across an obstacle, but I have in every other cookbook so I hope this is a little different.  I can't wait till Pesach next year to try a few items out.  I'm sure no one is going to go hungry with this.	2005-09-22

Those I understand well.  I love NFL but I understand (understood) it less.  This clarified all the parts I needed clarification on and now I'm understanding it fully.  Holly made this a fun read, but she knows her stuff too.  Now I don't look so blank when I watch a game on ESPN on pay tv.  She knows she's aiming this at intelligent women who are NFL'y challenged, so this is really well written and I highly recommend this to anyone.	2005-09-21

She's actually written this quite well.  My problem lies with her being so irresponsible and having other people (maybe well meaning), footing her bills.  She should have learned the hard way.  Some of the stuff in here is simply so stupid.  She at a lot of times was a pure idiot.  I just congratulate her in finding yet another way to make money off us innocents who are far more responsilbe than her.	2005-09-20

I could relate to a lot (not all) but enjoyed them all equally.  Some really stand out, and the writting of them all is excellent, funny, thought-provoking and honest.  One writer tells her family that she's in love with a German guy and getting married, one feels she can't be perfect or fit into society.  Which ever story you find the best, you have to admit they are all good and I'd really recommend this to any woman whether you are Jewish or not.  It's definately enjoyable.	2005-09-18

But with the help of this book, I've managed to make some of the nicest cookies I've ever made.  I found the recipes easy to follow and clear instructions.  The smells in the kitchen are so good, we've often eaten the goods before they are cooled properly.  If you are a little kitchen challenged, this is for you because as I mentioned, I'm finally getting some serious results (and putting on a pound or two).	2005-09-18

Only read if you want better health, longer limbs etc	This is a good read.  I didn't give it it's fifth star because not all information is new, however it's written in an easy to follow way and if you begin it right away, the results will happen right away.  The effects were amazing and you'll notice a difference fast.  This is the perfect addition to any exercise collection whether it be in books or dvds.  Buy this and begin immediately.

However, I'm disappointed.  It started off OK and I thought it'd keep going at an interesting pace, but it got silly and corny and even though it's fictional, it's stupid to have written that Gracie's husband, is going out with Britney Spears.  It became weird and didn't hold my interest.  Some parts were mildly funny and the rest was boring.  I don't know if I'd purchase another book of hers based on this.	2005-09-09

Even if you're like me and know your way around Los Angeles like the back of your hand, it still comes in handy.  It gives web addresses and phone numbers and more correct information than I've seen in other publications.  It also gives you the closest freeways to a particular location.  It's a good compact size too.  All the Time Out guides I've read are as good as this.  They are on a par if not better to Lonely Planet.	2005-09-04

If you've ever seen him on the Today show, his personality and his mood is infectious. He's really quick and sharp.  I love the adjectives he uses in here for people.  He never fails to make me laugh and he seems to be quite down to earth and an overall nice guy. Read this book. There's almost something in it for everyone and you won't regret buying this.  It's certainly not a deep and meaningful book but it's never been portrayed as such, so forget the negative reviews.	2005-09-04

I was laughing throughout most of the book.  Who knew learning was this much fun? <br /> <br />There are questions about morning breath, sucking poison out of snake bites, pee smelling different after eating asparagus (we've always wanted to know that one) and contact lenses getting lost in your head.  They basically answer it all.  Have a laugh and learn fun stuff at the same time.  I totally recomend this.	2005-09-03

If you are a fan of Guiney's you will like it; other than that, it's another story that shouldn't really have made it to print.

I've used the Los Angeles and Las Vegas and New York books and I've found stores that I didn't even know existed.  The one slight incy problem would be that there wasn't quite enough variety (as far as plus size clothes, obscure stores).  They give you phone numbers, store hours etc etc and this is really useful when you might be unfamilliar with a city.  Love them.	2005-08-30

Who really needs this kind of book to tell you what should be obvious if you listen to your gut instincts.  These authors are now rolling in the dough, because they wrote about a common sense approach to figuring out if a guy likes you.  If a guy doesn't call you again after a date, what does that tell you?  I know you can answer these questions yourself without reading this.  Put your money to a better book.	2005-08-27

(I also have recently ordered the Time Out Chicago).  It's an excellent guide and well laid out, easy to read and you get a great gauge for the city you're interested in.  For examples, they give you good directions on how to get to where you're going, and they include a huge amount of website address' (not always - but mostly).  This LA guide is also designed for a bit of fun with bonus tidbits such as where you can find the Cunningham house from Happy Days, or where the school is from Grease.  There is equally good information in all areas ranging from accomodation to shopping (my favourite), museums and restaurants (my second favourite).  As a 'bonus' there is a good section at the back of the book all about useful information such as medical centers and emergencies, consulates, internet acces and Visa requirements to name a few.   <br /> <br />I liked this book a lot and as I said, I've gone and ordered another one of their guides.  I do find them very usefull and helpful.	2004-10-01

While these types of books are fairly well informative, they also instill fear into expecting mothers.  What happened to our mothers and our mothers mothers?  They didn't have books like this and yet they still managed quite well to do things naturally and based on instinct.  For the most part, we all turned out well.  These books make people paranoid to the extent that they are worried about whether they can even do ANYTHING whilst pregnant.  I certainly am not going to worry about what I can or can't eat (my mother ate normally), whether I'm able to use certain skin creams (in the old days - if you had to, you had to) etc.  I will use common sense and not be scared to breathe by these books.  Women; make your own decisions and things will work out as good if not better.  Use this book as only a guide, but don't feel you have to do exactly as they say.	2004-09-19
