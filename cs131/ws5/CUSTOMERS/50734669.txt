Once more,Mary Balogh uses one of her favourite<BR>metaphors to craft the perfect ending to one of the best series<BR>I've ever read.I refer to the mask,the everyday masks we all <BR>wear.In this case,the mask of the cold,haughty aristocrat,which<BR>was how His Grace of Bewcastle was perceived.That is why Mary's<BR>choice of matching him with Mrs.Derrick.Wulf needed someone who<BR>was his polar oppisite to strip away his perceived mask,to re-<BR>mind him that he was Wulfric Bedwyn.This series will be always<br />remembered.	2004-06-07

When I received it, I had to read it right away. I  read it in one night, and when I fi- nished reading the book, I knew that  it had been worth the wait. Judith has written another wonderfully wimsical  tale. All the  characters, but most especially the titular character are  wonder- ful. Nick shows his gallantry towards Serendipity;the heroine and  her little sister Delight. Since this is the first book in a ser- ies, I  cannot wait for the next book.
