Unlike the last couple, which were somewhat inpenetrable, this volume is filled with great stories, mixed with a couple of gems.  <br /> <br />About the only useless bit is the introduction, which merely lists the stories and says a tiny amount about their origin.  <br /> <br />There really are no clunkers in this volume. It's a page turner and a great introduction to possibly the best writer working in SF today.	2005-09-22

Gag Rule is a well-written extended essay on the problem of fostering and nurturing dissent in American society, media, and, especially, politics. The end of the Cold War and beginning of the \\"war on terror\\" clearly has accompanied a marked a change in the tone and substance of American political life and here Lapham laments the replacement of substance and deep thought or debate with soundbites, substance-free news, and spin. <br /> <br />This is a deeply interesting topic, or at least it should be, and Lapham is no slouch. He writes a polemic and goes out of his way to identify the culprits in the matter--ranging from promoters of \\"PC\\" talk to Woodrow Wilson. Others have commented on his erudition and his command of facts (or \\"facts\\", depending on your point of view). <br /> <br />My problem with this book is twofold. <br /> <br />First, although I share a political viewpoint with Lapham in many cases, his writing is so thoroughly anti-Bush and anti-conservative that this book will have essentially no audience among the \\"red\\" crowd. Instead of seeking the middle ground where most American's used to live (neither Republican nor Democrat but rather \\"moderate\\"), he writes in a manner guaranteed to stir the blood of partisans on his side--and to be entirely dismissed by the opposition. Hardly a starting point for a debate about preserving the fundamental nature of political discourse. <br /> <br />Secondly, this book outlines the problem and the potential for disaster that exists in any democracy but it doesn't address the remedies that might be applied. Yes, Hitler did a good job of taking over Germany. What approach can stop a demagogue? How can the lap dog Democrats be turned into the pit bulls of individual liberty? (It is strange even to write that: since when were the Democrats associated with the libertarian movement?!?) <br /> <br />Still and all: this book gives you something to think about and a unique approach to thinking about it. If it sets some teeth onedge, well, perhaps that's all to the better. Allowing one side or the other to dominate the terms of the debate ultimately leads to very boring debate indeed. Maybe this is the start of a coherent position in opposition to the conservatives. That would be good for everyone. <br /> <br />Finally, I have to note that the themes and examples presented here have entered into the world of punditry as specific cases to hammer on: a kind of pundit's shorthand for various issues. For example, I read a conservative op-ed piece in the S.F. Chronicle just yesterday that cited Wilson, Thucydides (and the Athenian adventure in Sicily), Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, and several other items from this very book but presented exactly upside-down. It is bizarre to see an rhetorical war break out over the (rather too extensive) footnotes to the argument without tangling with the substance.	2005-08-01

I haven't read the other Chalion books: this is my first Bujold book and so I can't comment on the relative quality of this entry into the \\"series\\"... but in terms of absolute quality, I really liked this book and am happy (gleeful) to report I have a new author I can look for. <br /> <br />Hallowed Hunt is a completely independent book. You need not read the other entries into the series to appreciate it, although some background gets short shrift. The opening premise is stunning, well-executed, and draws you into the book to see where Bujold is going to go with it. The ending is also pretty darned good, making the book well worth the read. <br /> <br />It's the middle that drags. The characters are a bit flat (more dimension than most \\"epic fantasy\\", but not good enough to carry a couple of hundred pages by themselves). A good bit of the front half of the book is just setting the pieces up and the action is somewhat contained. Nonetheless, this is one of the better fantasies I've read recently and a good step up from most of the over-long junk that lines the shelves of the local megastore. Recommended, although I suspect the other books in this series are better.	2005-07-21

Having scrolled past the thicket of sentence-fragment hyperbole above to read this review, you must by now have realized that this book has garnered a lot of glowing reviews... or at least a lot of small sentence fragments that *suggest* genuine talent. The question is whether this slim collection is worthy of ravishing praise.    It is.    Each of the stories here is nicely crafted. The atmosphere and texture of each story seems to seep right off the page, rich in flavor, as if the story were printed in Technicolor. The characters are nicely drawn--a hint of melancholy or nostalgia permeates the volume. Each story leaves you wishing for a little bit more. It's... nice.    Oddly, this book reminds me of the old Gilchrist collection \\"Victory Over Japan\\", and I can't say why, other than both are fine collections. The other author I was reminded of was Wallace Stegner (interestingly Ms. Orringer credits participation in a Stegner workshop; perhaps something rubbed off?---that's unfair, actually, since she's visibly a talent in her own right).    In any case, from the first story to the last, here is a volume that hits all your senses, like the taste of bitter chocolate or the smell of a fine vintage just after you've pulled the cork, and leaves you in anticipation of more.    Worth the adulation: absolutely.	2005-05-20

We adopted a four-year-old boy from Russia during the middle part of last year, and, of course, we faced many of the challenges that other families encounter in building trust, establishing a bond, integrating a new family member, and so forth. Having nearly survived the difficult early period, we were recommended this book by our social worker as something of interest to parents in our situation. <br /> <br />I found this book to be okay: helpful on the diagnosis side, but not so helpful on the resolution side.  <br /> <br />As with other books about parenting, it does to tend to present issues more in the light of nightmare scenarios (exaggerating what most parents encounter, which is not to say that some parents don't encounter situations just like those presented, of course).  <br /> <br />It's nice that the book immeidately goes beyond the catch-all rubric of \\"attachment problems\\", a phrase that is uselessly vague and helplessly non-specific. Our son faced (and continues to face) a number of challenges that this book does help identify (sexual abuse, abandonment, language skills, etc.) and categorizing the different kinds of issues in their own framework is a huge benefit. <br /> <br />It then proceeds to give bullet-point ways to try and address the situations. This is not an entirely satisfactory. Instead of seeming surefooted, these come across more like folk remedies (with no measure of success, no case studies showing whether something is working or showing lack of progress as well). Some things just seem like they are thrown out because they worked for the author. For example, why is it that giving your child a massage is a constant suggestion? I mean, yes, by all means, use physical contact as appropriate, but really now... family foot massage time is such a specific recommendation. It seems like the suggestions could use more polish. <br /> <br />I found a lot of the suggestions to be rather indistinctly delivered as well. Having validated one's observations (or stirred one's fears) there is relatively little material on how to work on various problems. <br /> <br />I don't know how things will ultimately work out for our family, of course. I like to think that, for the most part, we have the issues under control and are creating a happy, safe environment for our son. This book in many ways recognizes the challenges this presents and is valuable in helping identify challenges that might otherwise go unnoticed. But it is not so helpful in resolving the problems. For that other books might be more suitable.	2005-05-16

James Tiptree, Jr. was one of my favorite SF authors back when I first was reading SF as a kid. Since I mostly read older books from the library, I wasn't \\"in\\" on the \\"big secret\\"--that James Tiptree was really \\"James Tiptree\\" aka Alice Sheldon. An award named after the author's nom de plume was created a few years ago and this is the first volume to fete the winners. <br /> <br />The award goes, it seems, to stories that explore gender roles. It is kind of a weird thing to build an award around, if you think about it. It isn't \\"stories that prominently feature women\\", for example: instead it is about stories in which gender or gender roles play a prominent part. <br /> <br />The stories presented here are uniformly excellent (which you would expect: the award winners are not in chronological order, so you'd expect them to pick the very best for the first volume).  <br /> <br />The essays are less effective; a couple of them are familiar from other places (the Le Guin entry, for example, feels like pure filler--why didn't they just excerpt Disposessed for cryin' out loud?!?). The letter from Tiptree, reprinted here, is glorious, although, oddly it did make me wonder what she would have thought of the award. The introduction is slightly goofy. Suzy Charnas's essay is good, if a bit more inside baseball than I really needed.  <br /> <br />Still and all: you're unlikely to pick up a better anthology this year. And the broader, quirky scope of the award keeps the volume from being tedious: there are lots of interesting gender roles to explore in SF and there is nothing mawkishly politically correct about the award winners (which one might reasonably fear going in). <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-13

The Hidden Stars is a not-bad fantasy novel (the first third of a purported trilogy, so what's new?) from a new writer, Madeline Howard. She tries very hard to set the right tone and ambiance for a semi-medieval fantasy of the Le Guin/Tolkein flavor by using the usual tricks of the trade (Celtic or Gaelic names, Northern European milieau, etc. etc.). Although she deftly avoids giving us Yet Another coming of age story featuring what amounts to American youths dressed up in Renaisance Pleasure Faire garb, she also avoids giving us a fresh story or her own characters or landscape. <br /> <br />The result is a good read, not overly complex and, sadly, not very stirring either. Her betters (and her inferiors) have done this theme to pieces. With nothing particularly notable or noteworthy to say, it is hard to recommend this book, since I must admit that I kept wanting to stop and send the author a copy of The Language of the Night so she could bone up on what's missing here: nothing here smacks of the True Speech, it's all debased from some other work. <br /> <br />All that said, it is a nice first effort and the book does have a certain charms to it in places. I'm giving it four stars, but really it is more of a 3 1/2 effort.	2005-04-25

My previous exposure to John Myers Myers consists of his two works of fiction (Silverlock and The Harp and the Blade), both of which I enjoyed greatly and have treasured. I knew that he'd written historical books like this, but had never run across one. A review on Amazon tipped me off to this book. <br /> <br />Myers has a very peculiar, particular voice which he uses a great deal early in this slim volume (his text settles back into a more mainstream flow as the pages fly by), which is a little odd, but somewhat amusing. He wears his heart on his sleeve and it is quite clear what he thinks of his sources, of the historical characters, and so on. Balanced and nuanced this book ain't! <br /> <br />But then maybe it shouldn't be. Here is a story that just seems too tall a tale, right up there with a certain large lumberjack and his technicolor ox or stretched from the same cloth as Dan'l Boone was in Fess Parker's portrayal, about a man who wouldn't say quit come pirates, bears, or (forgive the era that spawned it) \\"wild\\" Indians. Hugh Glass, if you've never heard of him, might have been the greatest of the mountain men. <br /> <br />Myers builds a pretty good case for the man and his adventures having taken place. Here's a hero I hadn't really encountered before and Myers make his legend believable without ruining exploits worthy of campfire retellings. Not too big a book, just right. I recommend it (in spite of Myers's oddities).	2005-04-25

To read the synopsis of the book here or read other reviews, you may be thinking: Powers can't pull this off. He's got too many themes, too many things going on. But somehow from the Fisher King and Bugsy Segal and tarot cards and chaos theory and TS Eliot and so much more he fashions something new, something whole. <br /> <br />Here the realistic, dark, somewhat noir feel, not quite Raymond Chandler, gets mixed up with the urban fantasy feel of, say, Charles de Lint. Unlike de Lint's work, though, Powers doesn't run off to fairy land. The book stays rooted in its modern American West setting. His characters are realistic and complex. The events, while filled with that fantastic and that phantasmogoric, flow naturally, building and building the trap in which our anti-hero finds himself trapped, playing poker for his life.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-01

I first ran into Lethem's fiction back in the early 90's, when his first novel, Gun with Occasional Music, captivated me. As a novel it was unique and fascinating and glorious... and obviously a homage to Philip K. Dick, an obsession I too have indulged. Subsequent novels cast about for something to say before finally getting back on track in the last couple of years. <br /> <br />I read the essay \\"The Beards\\" in the New Yorker recently and had to own this book. Suddenly a lot of things about who this guy is and what he's about were clear. Each of his essays, so \\"about\\" obsession or longing or the importance of certain films or authors or what-have-you are also explorations of his internal landscape and the larger themes of growing up, or coming to grips with our own or our parent's humanity. <br /> <br />Unplugged from the need to fictionalize, Lethem finds a voice that sometimes eludes him in is fiction. And it is a funny, moving voice with interesting tales to tell.	2005-04-01

The Ancestor's Tale is Richard Dawkins's latest book on evolution: a deep dive into the details of how evolution works, the evidence in support of it, the methods used to deduce relationships between species, and, at its heart, how we (humans) got here. <br /> <br />The form is unique, since Dawkins chooses to march back into the past from today, rather than forward from the beginnings of life. It's an effective way of showing our parochial view of the world without falling into the \\"inevitability\\" trap. <br /> <br />Along the way, Dawkins takes the time to explain every detail and nuance of how genetic (molecular) and fossil evidence is found, weighed, and interpreted. He explains in clear (if not exactly concise) English prose all the technical bits, so that the reader feels an understanding of the techniques and so on.  <br /> <br />There are some odd things. In spite of the book's title and its inward desire to use Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as a form, the entire book is written in the first person: there are no tales told by Orangutans and Platypi in this book. The \\"xxx's Tale\\" sub-chapter titles I found pointless, since they barely break the stride of the surrounding narrative, all in the author's singular voice. Although in many places he refers far ahead in the book (to specific \\"tales\\"), the text is rather holistic and can't really be accessed randomly. <br /> <br />Dawkins's prose is a bit old-fashioned too. Although he pays homage to other ethnic and national groups, the text is oddly slanted towards white British people, possibly members of the Royal Academy circa 1896? The tone is actually quaint, if you can overlook his slights towards French scientists and general distrust of Americans. <br /> <br />Dawkins does go out of his way to anglicize as much of the fuddy-duddy Latin as possible and spell out everything (even when it doesn't need spelling out to the attentive reader), making the material as emphatically accessible as possible.  <br /> <br />You can probably overlook his occasional bashing of creationists too. I thought that was a bit silly, since the book as a whole is such a thorough refutation of that dogma: why bother rubbishing them so often. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, unlike other, more specific books about specific bits of evolutionary theory, this books tries hard to (and succeeds in) capturing the big picture of evolution in ways that no other book I'm familiar with does. Unlike most popular science artiles, films, or books, here you get all of the current information on topics that you may think you've been following and are familiar with. It is breathtaking and revealing, since you will almost certainly learn a new respect for Darwin's Dangerous Idea and why scientists believe in it so fervently.	2005-03-21

But those first weeks and months were awful. <br /> <br />This book is nicely written and reasonably well organized. It's a quick read and provides a lot of useful ideas for how to defuse and ultimately avoid situations. Much of it is common sense or \\"frame shifting\\" (putting you into the child's situation through their eyes). I found some of the strategies useful and others not applicable, which is what you'd expect. <br /> <br />The downside of this book is that it is a bit on the frothy side, a bit simplistic and stagey. Some of the examples and true-life type stories go from one extreme to a too-good-to-be-true resolution \\"a week later\\". Some of the divisions in the book struck me as artificial. <br /> <br />Nonetheless this book is the standard for many parent dealing with this kind of problem for good reason. It is a useful reference, gets you to think about managing the situations better and gives you some tools to work with. Well recommended.	2005-02-25

My mind boggles a bit at the adulation heaped upon it, a sort of uncritical fervor last seen hyping the much less worthy Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br />Breezily written, this book borrows some writing tricks from more substantial work. Notably, of course, is the use of a first person narrator who is \\"impaired\\" (in this case by autism) in a manner similar to, say, Flowers for Algernon. The use of unusual chapter numbering (prime numbers in this case), statistics problems, diagrams, and so forth is amusing in a observational kind of way. These are all tricks, though, that make you sit back a bit from the book. Oooh! Isn't that clever? <br /> <br />In any case, the back half of the book seemed to telegraph much of the plot and I surely hope we don't get a sequel. But it is so amusing and a nice diversion from much of the drivel available today that I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read.	2005-02-02

I grew up in Carmel, just a few miles from Point Lobos, with family roots in the area, so I thought I knew the history of Point Lobos. Such a beautiful, gem-like block of land, it has attracted the attention of artists for many decades, most notably Ed Weston. It turns that the history is both deeper and richer than I knew, and I owe my knowledge of it to this book. <br /> <br />It isn't about the beauty of the landscape but rather the history of the people who dwelt there, used  the land, and ultimately preserved it. It puts faces and names to the place and demonstrates what a near-run thing it was to have this land preserved at all. <br /> <br />This book presents both the beauty and the people using small amounts of carefully written text paired with many, many well-chosen historical photographs. If you live near or have a love of Point Lobos and the middle California coast, then I think you'll find this a fascinating addition to your library or coffee table.	2005-01-31

Marque and Reprisal is space opera in the classic 1950's vein, reminiscent of, say, Heinline juvenile novels of that vintage. Basically this is a fast paced adventure yarn that revels in its use of pulp magazine forms from that era. <br /> <br />In case it isn't clear, this is the second book in a new series, and this book makes no effort to be a standalone entity (although you could probably read it on its own, you shouldn't bother: TRADING IN DANGER, the first, is a perfectly good read). <br /> <br />Moon's a good writer and she uses all of her considerable talent to distract the reader from questioning the amazing coincidences and other events that populate the plot here. She's got the pace and breathlessness of space opera down pat and her arm-waving moves you right along, wondering where heroine Ky Vatta will end up and how she'll get there. The core story is fun. The twists and turns come briskly and are entertaining. <br /> <br />I found the front half of the book a bit odd. The technology, writing, and \\"sandbox\\" of the book is lifted right from the 50's, before cell phones and the Web and so forth... and that style directly aped XIXth Century sailing adventure novels. Horatio Hornblower would feel right at home striding the deck with our (somewhat two-dimensional) cast of characters. It isn't just a space opera, but a solid pastiche of what used to pass for pulp magazine adventure stories. Even the incredibly-convenient-but-wholly-improbable \\"open door in the alleyway\\" bit is entirely in keeping with the homage. <br /> <br />As the book progresses, things get a bit more modern in their sensibility and style and the action bits at the end feel more like 80s Hammer's Slammers than 50s Starship Troopers. <br /> <br />I fret for the future of this series, which seems to be building up a number of inconvenient facts and a lot of stray detail and inconsistencies, but this book and its predecessor are good solid fun. Well recommended.	2005-01-24

The styling is nice, but the fantasy elements would have been better handled if Purdy were willing to either embrace the genre fully or really do more than just paint a nice atmospheric picture. <br /> <br />I recommend this book, but tepidly: it's a good read, but there is no reason to go out of your way to acquire it.

Samuel Delany is often cited by other SF authors as an inspriation or a great practitioner of the craft of writing. His novels, such as Dhalgren and Triton, are well-regarded. They are also frequently unapproachable: big, gnarly books with big, gnarly subjects. They certainly are not much like the rafts of semi-literate junk that passes for much of SF these days. But you won't sit down and toss of a Delany novel... <br /> <br />This book, though, is hugely approachable. As a short story collection, it covers a wide span of the author's career and gives us very classic, deep, meaningful, soulful stories. From \\"Star Pit\\" as the start to the author's afterword we get a range of great and near-great stories. If you love Delany's longer work, here is a chance to collect a beautiful volume of short fiction.

The title of this series is pretty clear: each book in this series contains the most important stories from a particular segment or portion of Hal Clement's long career. This volume focuses on short stories, although many of them are fairly long. Clement is known primarily for his hard SF stories with plausible science as the background for many stories. <br /> <br />An example in this volume would be \\"Raindrop\\", which has an ecosystem in a huge orbiting blob of water. Clement's writing is prototypical of the era preceeding the New Age SF of the 60's, if a cut (way) above what most authors can achieve. Characters inner emotional development is not the point here, but this isn't as important as it sounds. Clement always grabs you with really amazing setups: the classic \\"what-if\\" story. <br /> <br />If I had to pick two authors that he most reminds me of, it would be \\"James Tiptree Jr.\\" and Larry Niven. The former is his contemporary and the latter is more of his heir. If you like their works, then Clement is probably for you. <br /> <br />This book is very solid, filled with readable, engaging, and sometimes truly classic stories. Many of his concepts are truly ground-breaking. No doubt a future volume will contain his famous \\"Needle\\" (John Campbell famously said an SF detective story could not be written... and Clement not only wrote one, he created a detective--and alien--so memorable it is still being ripped off, er, paid homage to). <br /> <br />But this volume... this volume is marvelous and belongs on any serious SF fan's shelf.	2004-10-05

Why would you want to own such a voluminous set? And why this particular one? <br /> <br />Simply: Sturgeon is one of the most provocative, innovative and beautiful writers in the English language and the title story of this volume alone is worth the price of the book. But once you're beyond one of the arguably greatest stories of the last 51 years, you'll find that Sturgeon has many more wonders in every volume of this series. For example, \\"Mr Cosell, Hero\\" is the most thorough demolition of the 1950's Red Scare (and it is set in outer space!). \\"The Clinic\\" predates classics like Flowers for Algernon, and gives us an alien perspective to boot. <br /> <br />Sturgeon's writing, as noted in many places, is about love as much as it is about anything. With each new volume, he inspires his readers to share that feeling.

You may be concerned by the reviews here, which fall into exactly two camps: 5 stars-over-the-moon and 1 star-hated-it. I think there are good reasons for this, but first: I liked 1-2-3 Magic. It is a short, well-written, direct, easy-to-use manual for the common \\"counting\\" discipline method that we all (think we) know. <br /> <br />The part of the book that deals with \\"stop\\" behaviors is particularly good because it gives you a parenting tool for discipline and boy does it work! Used according to the book (and within the context of good, healthy parenting, not as a sole remedy to all problems), I've found that I can be much more in control of those problem moments that used to vex me and which led to tears, bribery, long talks, and which used to leave me feeling inadequate as a parent. <br /> <br />The over-the-moon reviews generally mention the success story moment when \\"that's one\\" stops the Badness right in its tracks. If you adopt this method, you will have that moment, and really quickly too. Mine was at the local pool, where my son was hitting another kid (and, yes, there were \\"reasons\\", but that wasn't important: the hitting has to stop). All I had to say was \\"Dashiell, that's one\\" and the behavior just stopped. The other parent ended up with a long-winded diatribe resulting in a crying kid being led from the pool. There but for the grace... <br /> <br />Of course there are limits to the use of any parenting tool. You still have to be aware of your child's moods, fears, lack-of-rest, etc. Counting is not a panacea. <br /> <br />The last third of the book, which deals with \\"start\\" behaviors (things you want your child to start to do, as opposed to stop doing NOW), is less useful if not useless. The techniques there really require more active effort and parental involvement anyway. Common sense says that encouraging good behaviors and habits (as opposed to stopping bad ones) is harder and can't be \\"plugged in\\". <br /> <br />In any event, this book does give the tips to solving the \\"discipline monster\\" without hitting, screaming or yelling, and with amazingly few tears (for everyone involved). It's not really \\"magic\\", but used wisely it really produced the results it promised to me.	2004-09-03

I have to admit to a soft spot in my heart for anything by Robert Silverberg, since he's written some of the books that most moved me over the years. From Thorns to Shaderach in the Furnace to Up the Line, he has written an amazing number of classic novels and shorter fare. Despite the fact that he's written many pure SF novels, he also has a fondness and penchant for writing about the ancient world.    Here we get a set of short stories (which is not clear from the cover: bad publisher, no biscuit!) which display the unique tone and amazing attention to detail that characterizes much of his work. The quality is a bit uneven, with some of the stories being somewhat unreadable, but the majority of them are quite good and one or two are very good indeed.    For example, the first story after the front matter (\\"With Caesar in the Underworld\\") bears the plot of Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, with a lead character of Faustus (\\"Falstaff\\"), set in the wonderfully decadent ancient Rome of this alternate history. There are little sparkly details throughout that make the story bump along, teasing you with both the puzzles that form the alternate history bits and the tidbits of fun (parallels with the lifted Shakespeare plot, for example). It... tickles.    Other reviewers have complained that Silverberg doesn't dive as deeply into the history part, that the stories are all little \\"what if...\\" one-trick ponies. But I think those reviewers are missing the fact that in virtually all of these character driven stories, there is at least one other \\"angle\\" that Silverberg is playing with. Once I recognized what he was doing, it was a lot of fun to both read the stories as straight AH yarns and also be watching for the sly games.    This isn't the Silverberg of the great early 70's novels. Nor does it quite match his lovely time-travel novel \\"Up the Line\\" (if you've not read that, get it with this). It's just that no one except possibly Gene Wolfe quite matches his style and careful,multi-layered craftsmanship. I enjoyed this collection (despite, as noted, some warts) and, if you like alternate history, you probably will too.	2004-08-25

Generally I don't care that much for what passes as epic fantasy these days. Most of the books feature juvenile coming of age stories or just endless plodding plot without much point. I have to admit that I didn't want to like it.    In some ways this novel is fairly typical of the genre. It features a generic overall plot and stock-in-trade characters. Goodkind is not a great writer: he lays on the plot developments with a trowel. His dialog is flat and workmanlike. There are some pretty obvious logical flaws in the book (the touch aspect of Kahlan's power makes no sense). The villain is pure melodrama. So, okay, this novel will not be taught in Lit classes alongside slimmer volumes like \\"War and Peace\\".    Still... I found that the plot delivered here was interesting and kept developing in nice ways. I enjoyed the developments and kept being surprised that I was still reading and still wanting to read the book. This book is exactly perfect in a lot of ways: the main characters do not become too godlike or too good. Goodkind avoids plot developments that rely on obvious out-of-character reactions--what the characters do flows from who they are and what they would do in that situation.    Overall it was an engaging read and I went on to enjoy Stone of Tears the following week. (After that the wheels came off the series for me, or maybe I was just tired of the characters for a bit). I like this, the first book in the series, and recommend it as a (really humongous) solid and entertaining read.	2004-08-25
US	52146736	RADNXN827IDWL	0374528837	513130379	The Founding Fish	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Meandering fish tale...	John McPhee is rightly regarded as a masterful writer, with a bent to outdoorsy activities. Here in Founding Fish he examines his \\"obsession\\" with a particular species, the American shad. <br /> <br />The shad is a fish that spawns like a salmon, living in the sea but coming home to a particular river or stream to lay eggs. McPhee covers every aspect of the shad, its habits and habitat, and the people who fish for shad. As always his writing, when viewed in chapter-sized chunks, is crisp and sparkling and fascinating. <br /> <br />The book, however, is somewhat dull. While a good fishing yarn requires some patience, this book meanders like a sluggish river, touching this or that topic, from dam removals to fishing habits as it wanders and wanders, twisting and turning over the same material, back and forth, in a kind of passionless amble. It takes, well, an appreciation of or obsession with the shad to carry you through this material, I think. <br /> <br />Anything by McPhee is better than 90% of what you'll read elsewhere (Sturgeon's Law in effect). I want to rate the book more highly because McPhee does bring to life people and events that touch upon the history of the shad, but the book as a whole is a yawn. Read it if you are a McPhee fan, otherwise I'd suggest Secret Life of Lobsters to wake you from it.	2004-08-22

Peter Ward's new book, about the most devastating (and mostly unknown) mass extinction in natural history, an event that dwarfed the end of the dinosaurs in scale, shows the insides of geology and paleontology in action.    Ward gives us the pain and sacrifices of exploring the Earth's mysteries, without glamourizing it. But he also gives us the satisfaction that comes with the accomplishment of understanding something... in this case something pretty big and \\"important\\".    Like many popular science books, this one has some thin spots. We could use more feeling for what this ancient world might have been like. We don't meet the critters: there are a couple of hazy pages about what that world might have been like. Although the book is titled \\"Gorgon\\", that isn't at all what it is about.     What it is about is the painstaking ten years of field work in South Africa's Karoo desert. We get a feel for how little is known and how it gets pieced together. For example, we get to follow exactly how one fellow scientist reconstructs the way layers of sediment were laid down, determining if there was a \\"break\\" in the timeline. We read about each expedition, focusing on the discomfort of the whole experience.    This sounds tedious and surely the work itself was, but here you get a solid sense in a few pages of what had to be done. That part is well told.     There is also some personal commentary, focused on the personalities of various participants. It's a bit \\"inside baseball\\", but that is interesting too.    Ultimately, this is a documentary of how insight into a complex problem was developed. The extinction of 94% of life on Earth is a scary thing to contemplate. Understanding it seems like a valuable endeavor. Appreciating how we understand it, which is what this book really gives the reader, is a grand result.	2004-08-16

Ms. Le Guin's latest collection of essays and &quot;nonfictive&quot; writings looks like one of those books that is dull, scholastic, dry, and unentertaining. But...<br /><br /> I don't think she can write anything in those four modes. Although some of the topics look unapproachable (anyone up for counting the number of stressed syllables in &quot;The Three Little Bears&quot;?) it is her craft as a writer that infuses even minute themes with that elusive &quot;readability&quot;. I read even the most esoteric of the bits here.<br /><br /> Like her collection &quot;Language of the Night&quot;, this book focuses mostly on the craft of writing. It ranges from close examination of rhythm to broad biographical topics.<br /><br /> Unlike some recent collections (Niven's Scatterbrain comes instantly to mind), this book is not just a grab bag of material mouldering on the author's shelf. Indeed, most of the essays have been reworked for inclusion in this volume, making each part more coherent.<br /><br /> On the other hand, this book really should be part of Langauge of the Night. There seems to be something essential missing. As the source material was not purpose written for a book, the theme connecting the items is pretty diffuse. Having access to these writing is good and the book is an easy breezy read (I read all it on a flight from Denver to San Francisco), but maybe a little bit more &quot;connective tissue&quot; is needed. I dunno, I'm still mulling over various things here: I'm writing about four letters to the author in my head. I don't want to be critical and I guess I just wanted more.<br /><br /> So then, if you like to read about what goes on in the head of the author of many classics, whose works continue to astonish and amaze and aspirate in your mind after the book it put away... then here is a morsel that needs your attention.	2004-08-01

Slave Masters is a very good space opera, one of the better new SF novels I've read in months. <br />  <br /> It's actually a sequel to another book called &quot;Slave Trade&quot;, although you'd never know it from the cover. Or from the writing. The events of the previous novel, which I've not read, are merely minor plot developments, adding to the richness of this book. Nicely handled. In fact, this appears to be the middle of a trilogy, but that is not all that important to appreciating this book. How refreshing! <br />  <br /> The basic plot here involves a race that enslaves other spacefaring races (and a particular species, the Qin, who, along with some humans) are fighting against them. The descriptions above and on the cover of the novel bear no resemblance to the actual plot. The sexual peccadillos of the enslaving race are a theme, to be sure, but not necessarily the main theme. The kidnapping from Earth, etc., appears to be the plot of Slave Trade and has *nothing* to do with this book. Kind of weird. <br />  <br /> But... the big deal here are the characters, who are brightly drawn. I enjoyed the somewhat intricate interplay between the various characters. <br />  <br /> There are a few downsides. The space battles, etc., are not realistic and somewhat hackneyed. The alien races aren't very alien--they're just slightly funny looking people. Nonetheless, this is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to others in this series and to other works by this author.	2004-07-30

Newton's Wake is billed as &quot;A Space Opera&quot;, which I guess is supposed to explain why this is a bit of a creampuff of a novel. MacLeod is a deft writer, with a nice ability to turn phrases.<br />We are dropped into the action and MacLeod does a good job of the &quot;slow reveal&quot; of the characters and the circumstances. We get a good feel for this universe and the folks who inhabit it. We get a variety of characters who's basic humanity is challenged by circumstances: there were trapped as a program, head replaced with a metal head, social pariah, simulation of the original person, etc. And there are little touches (Ben Ami's play about Leonid Breznhev is a hoot).<br />But... I found some jarring elements here too. We don't get close enough to most of these characters to really care all that much about them. Perhaps it is supposed to be telling that there are no real &quot;bad guys&quot; or &quot;good guys&quot;, but the author should have had some stance on the Big Issues he raises, like: if you die and a version of you is brought back to life, it is really you? What if the version of you that is brought back isn't really you, it's just a reconstruction of other people's perception of you? Those are truly interesting questions and MacLeod goes nowhere with them: he asks without developing either an opinion or going near the really thorny bits. We are told more often than we are shown the developments that really matter.<br />I was annoyed by some &quot;reverse anachronisms&quot; here: things from today that inappropriately show up in this far future time and don't fit. I found the debate about &quot;Returners&quot; vs. &quot;Runners&quot; was ultimately empty, as much of the plot was empty, because the author doesn't seem to feel the motivations. The conflicts in the novel are set pieces.<br />As a space opera, this is neither gonzo enough to be a really wild ride nor pithy enough to really deal with the fascinating issues the book raises. This is a good read and I'll be keeping an eye on MacLeod, though. Here's an author with some talent. But this won't be his best novel.	2004-07-15

Here's an unheralded classic, returned to print after a decade on the shelf, which is simply one of the more marvelous fantasies out there. I was simply spellbound by this book.<br />A brief description of this novel tends to emphasize what's not important about this novel. There are several important things here that make this a delight.<br />First, simply, are the characters. Brightly drawn and lovable, be they knaves or heroes. The texture and dialog do not (as many fantasy novels do) evoke modern Americans, even though there is no dialect used.<br />Second is the feel for medieval Europe, history, and realism (in what is a rather fanciful novel). Although this novel features such things as dwarves, dervishes, King Arthur, Merlin, Excaliber, the Fisher King, Norse gods, etc., the sheer realism of the novel never is pierced.<br />Third is the delight that infuses the whole work. Why the title alone is at least triple entendre, if not quadruple. I mean: how can you dislike a work who's central premise is that Western civilization is based in no small part on quality beer?<br />So by now it is obvious that I love this book. If you like books such as Silverlock or Brunner's Traveller in Black, I think you'll be enchanted by this gem.	2004-07-14

Okay, this book has 30-odd reviews, all of the with five stars, and some with titles like &quot;the best book ever written&quot;. What's up with that? Well... if you are one of the people unlucky enough not to know A. Clarence Shandon, aka Silverlock, then scroll back up and add this book to your cart now. I can tell you all about this book (as anyone's review will do), but it'll just come off as hyperbole. I mean: reference hunting? What's fun about that? Pilgrim's Progress? Wasn't that one of those tedious books you read in high school (and hated)?<br />Okay, it sounds boring or tedious or somehow suspect, but this book will make your cheek muscles hurt from the silly grin you'll wear while reading it. The plot exists in part to hang all of these delightful songs (yes, songs), characters, rimshots, and, well, yes, references off of. But it never slows down or gets tedious at all. You'll find yourself merrily zipping along right through it. <br />It is hard to find because it comes and goes from print--this book's the size of a Michener novel--and most people get this white-knuckled grip on their second or third copy (the first ones always having been loaned out and NEVER returned). This book is LOVED, and if you don't know about it you should (again) scroll up and purchase it now... because...<br />...like the Hippocrene spring at the end of the book, I can tell you all about it, but you'll never *really* understand until you've sipped from its waters.	2004-07-14

If you know John Brunner's other work, well, this isn't like that. Traveller in Black is a collection of several mid-length stories that fit together in a progression. The nameless eponymous traveller, an agent of order, goes about imprisoning various chaotic entities and granting certain wishes. This works on several levels to give you allegories for the unexamined life, as well as a gripping adventure yarn.<br />In some ways, this book is a bookend to Larry Niven's &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; (and various sequels, etc.). The flavor and style is similar, although this book is very different. In any event, this is one of those touchstone books of fantasy: you'll see where other writers (including Niven's works cited above!) have &quot;borrowed&quot; some of the dazzling images in Brunner's classic. This gem is a great read and I recommend it highly.	2004-07-14

Zenith Angle is a ho-hum thriller in the Tom Clancy spy-novel with realistic techonology mould. It's by longtime SF writer Bruce Sterling and it's about the most mild 'thriller' you can imagine, with some of the least believable characters this side of reality TV.<br />At least the book is short, with big type.<br />I don't really want to dump too hard on Sterling: I actually laughed at a few of his amusing turns. But he covers much of the same territory as, say, Crytonomicon, while his main character is completely stereotypical \\"computer genius\\". This pretend character, who's technical background is of the Hitchcock \\"McGuffin\\" variety, is unlike any real hackers, crackers, or computer programmers you're likely to meet. The fine use of that loveable plot device--the deus ex machina--is on display here. It's all a bit disappointing. I mean: some of Stephenson's recent books had half the plot of this thin marshmallow, but the writing was so brilliant it hurt to put down. By intentionally drawing comparisons with Stephenson, Sterling is just asking to be lambasted, if not roasted over hot coals or forced to edit his next novel on a PDP-11.<br />On the other hand, this is about as intelligent as, say, Da Vinci Code and intended for the same middle-of-the-road non-technical audience. Using his ultra-slick, but apparently content-free Wired magazine credentials, and considering Sterling's not after impressing the grungy 2600 audience with this stuff, I guess he succeeds. I mean, I managed to READ the accursed thing. Nonetheless, this book will be entirely forgotten inside of a month. Buy it in paperback, if you must (although it is too short to be good beach reading). If you like Sterling, buy something else of his, like Islands in the Net and shun this book so he gets back to honest work.	2004-06-26

Still, the shorter collections of Larry Niven's work have never, to my knowledge, been out of print and for good reason. His short fiction is always amoung the most entertaining (his novels ain't bad either).<br />Although I'd read most of this book's contents elsewhere, it's nice to finally have Procrustes or the most recent Gil Hamilton story bound up in a volume. And the book benefits nicely from Niven's &quot;Harlan Ellison-esque&quot; personal introductions, foreward and epilogue.<br />On the downside, the back of this book is a bit thin on content and there are lengthy email exchanges with his collaborators reproduced. It's amusing &quot;inside baseball&quot; stuff, but really there isn't enough material to sustain this book (certainly in hardcover).<br />The fiction is worth the price of admission, for me at least, and the personal pieces are all good fun. Still, I'd prefer if Niven wrote some more fiction...	2004-06-24

Ringworld's Children is a pleasant revisit to our old friend Louis Wu and his motley crew, still bopping around the Ringworld. Like many others, I looked forward to the chance to see what new and interesting scrapes Larry Niven would get him into this time and seized the book at first opportunity.<br />Overall it was a pleasant diversion and a nice read. The ring is really fascinating as a place and here Niven makes it the most realistic its ever been. I don't mean the \\"additions\\" to make it more scientifically accurate, but rather the way he treats the slow degradation over the aeons and the way that various people have evolved to fit their world.<br />Alas... this book is too short and doesn't really contain new ideas. It does bring a lot of old Known Space ideas together in one place and the logical interplay of things like the anti-matter star system, super auto-doc, QII hyperdrive, and the ring itself is kind of fun. On the other hand, there are lots of elements (the Fringe War in particular) that are just there on the page, rather lifeless. The hyperspace monster thing (more-or-less a throwaway in any case) didn't amuse me (except: Beowulf Shaeffer was right and Carlos Wu was wrong in \\"Borderland of Sol\\", who'da thunk it?) for more than a second. In fact it rather annoyed me. I hope Niven has something interesting to do with the beasties in some future story.<br />I still like Niven's clear, affectation-free prose. This book doesn't rise to the level of the original and I'd much rather have had something heftier with some more interesting new ideas, but...<br />Sour grapes aside, Niven's \\"playspace\\" still has amazing flexibility. Rather than \\"down in flames\\", this book seems to open up various possible additional storylines in the future. I hope that Louis Wu does, in fact, live forever. (Secretly I'm pining for him to meet \\"dad\\" for a shared adventure.)<br />Wait for this one in paperback, my friends, but you'll want to read it nonetheless.	2004-06-17

You cannot fault the stories selected here: we get a variety of them, all generally classics. I just can't help it, though... this book is missing some kind of spark. Basically the introduction is nice, but not deeply informative. The stories themselves are neither introduced or postscripted. While, as I say, you cannot fault the selection, the selections are all too safe for my taste. Lovecraft, Dunsany, Howard, Pratchet. Okay, safe ground.<br />But there should have been some more risk taken here I think. James Branch Cabell instead of Dunsany, perhaps. Or Moorcock or LeGuin or Tanith Lee for Pete's sake. But the stories are all good and a good introduction (if you need it) or good sampling if not.	2004-05-28

This historical work is a well-written account of one of the most fascinating chapters in naval history, an unequal battle between the biggest Japanese battleships and cruisers vs. a group of destroyers and &quot;pocket&quot; aircraft carriers in late 1944 off the Phillipines.<br />It examines an interesting problem, which is how the US Navy would react and handle a situation of certain desctruction: would they fight? how would they fight?<br />As history the book as some weaknesses. It focuses on the individuals on the American side, almost excessivly, and follows each step in the battle and each ship or airplane's participation minutely. The research effort was obviously enormous and the results are enourmously readable. <br />On the down side, the threading of sequences together is a bit difficult to follow, with leaps back in time to follow a different ship making it hard to keep up with the narrative flow at times. The &quot;human interest story&quot; focus and lack of detail on the Japanese side also serve to diminish the impact. We don't really see the effect of the Americans' efforts, except as they perceive it. And there is less introspection about some of the decisions than there could be.<br />That said, this book captures palpably the feelings and flavors of this kind of naval combat, now gone. If you've seen historical black and white footage (Victory at Sea, etc.), this gives you color and texture that is missing from those grainy images. Although it is not a perfect examination, it is an excellent popular recounting of an overlooked and interesting moment in naval warfare.	2004-05-26

I first read Shadrach Mordecai's story in the pages of the July 1976 Analog magazine, so this story has been with me a long time. It affected me so strongly, that I remember the *other* stories in that edition of Analog (the cover story was &quot;Tricentennial&quot;, a story you've NEVER heard of--see what I mean)<br />This book, with Stochastic Man, Thorns, and a couple of others came just before Silverberg took a decade long hiatus from writing. Each of these &quot;last&quot; books was mind blowingly powerful, deep, and affecting. This book, out of print and mostly overlooked for much of that time, is in my opinion the best of those pre-hiatus novels.<br />The story is basic SF. Shadrach is doctor to the world's tyrant dictator, and his job is to keep the ancient tottering monarch alive until a more permanent solution to old age can be found. That solution is to move the tyrant's mind to the body of a younger man and slowly Shadrach learns that the younger man chosen is---Shadrach Modecai.<br />Set in Ulan Bator (today's capitol of Mongolia, and, here, world capitol), this novel follows Shadrach's dealing with this problem: how he is mentally affected and how he solves the problem in a world where everything is monitored. As usual, Silverberg gives us both the interior of a compelling character and spectacular and vivid flavor of a future world unlike our own.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-21

This novel is basically set up as a mystery thriller--what is it about the planet Jardinoor that the very rich inhabitants are hiding from their substitute doctor? I'll avoid spoiling the plot, except to say that it has something to do with the animals and alien that travel with the heroine, Shona Taylor, and the planet's inhabitants fixation on animals.<br />The writer is deft at handling the larger construction of the book, but this book is disappointing on a variety of levels.<br />For starters, despite the milieu and onstensible setup, it is not an SF novel or even a sci-fi novel, not really. Search-and-replacing \\"starship\\" and \\"planet\\" with \\"tramp steamer\\" and \\"island\\" would make this a contemporary novel. Indeed, very minor wordsmithing would make this a Western (\\"horse\\", \\"remote Western town\\") or a tepid spy thriller (\\"submarine\\", \\"Soviet Union\\").<br />The core of this novel contains a variety of interesting modern concerns (animal welfare, cloning, stem cell research, bio-ethics, climate/plantary change, even gay marriage). Despite spending time building up such weighty topics freighted with possibility, the author avoids or plays down the sticky issues (turning the real crime of the black-hearted villain into theft, rather than confronting the ethical problems at hand).<br />The characters are entirely stereotypical, with no moral contradictions (good people are invariably good---often by who they associate with---while the bad people are mostly misguided). Many of the characters actions and events are driven by the necessities of the plot rather than the plot emerging from the personalities and foibles of the characters. The author actually seems unwilling to allow even her bad characters to violate what appear to be her own ethical standards.<br />I gave this book three stars because itis readable and literate in its faults and I genuinely like some of the central characters. There are some nice touches, such as the handling of personal space or an entirely automated culture. As pulp fiction it is almost adequate. But I must admit that I'm almost angry that a writer with this level of talent is just churning out something this uninspired.<br />If you've not read \\"Needle\\", \\"Case of Conscience\\", or \\"Word for World is Forest\\", go pick those up. Each of those confront some of the themes that this book uses as mere window dressing. Unwilling to tread on shaky moral ground or commit to a position, this novel is unworthy of its author.	2004-04-22

The first half or more is a nice combination of SF with modern police procedural. As the book progresses, though, the writer seems to lose an idea of where to go (and to some extent he's painted himself into a corner).<br />I liked the forgetfulness problem, although frankly Phil Dick has done this far better (FAR more frighteningly and effectively) in books like Ubik (if you like this one, Ubik will blow your doors off). Still, for a little novel, I enjoyed it, read it in about two sittings.<br />I agree with much of the criticism in other reviews here, but can't be too hard on the book. The writing is reasonably well crafted, if methodical, and I enjoyed it, even if suspending disbelief got harder at the book progressed.	2004-04-12

Having throughly mined out and made his own several SF ideas, Gene Wolfe turns to epic or heroic fantasy in this first half of a promised two-volume series.<br />Like so many series in this genre, we start with a boy who grows up (if you can call it that) to be a kind of super-mythic hero. He collects artifacts (swords, maces, etc) and retainers/hangers-on (elves, talking monster dogs, cats, trolls, people). He faces enemies and does so for the love of a beautiful queen.<br />Sound familiar? Hah. Wolfe demonstrates that all the folks word-processing Tolkein are missing the point. In covering the same ground, he carefully and freshly handles each of the elements without falling into pastiche.<br />On the down side: I didn't really like this book all that much--so why the 4 stars???. Like many Wolfe books, the style is sometimes offputting because of the author's penchant for certain writing tricks, like denying us direct view of important plot points and giving us a narrator who hints ahead and forgets to mention things.<br />The novel sometimes seems to be taking a long time to NOT get there from here. Nonetheless, I couldn't put it down and it compares favorably to several books I read during breaks in reading it. And the more you consider what you're reading the more impressive the achievement is.<br />Often in this genre we have teenage boys as protagonists who act like morons and make very illogical mistakes to drive the plot forward (this is supposed to show us their &quot;youthfulness&quot;). Here we get a character who's thinking is muddled and who sometimes acts rashly in a manner consistent with the character's age and experience. But the character isn't a fool or a moron. It's a difficult effect to achieve and, despite some misgivings, I'm actually looking forward to part two...	2004-04-12

I hadn't read much of SM Stirling, but this book is certainly a nice introduction to his work. Stirling is a solid writer and he has set up a reasonably fun premise and spent some effort to flesh out the landscape~~this novel positively lush with detail. <br />The novel is pure formula, even calculatedly so: the style is akin to adventure novels from circa 1900, a style no longer in fashion for a variety of reasons. Could it be that the characters are pure cardboard (the good guys are ALL good, even the red herring \\"bad\\" ones, and the bad guys are pure evil Lash LaRue)? If you like modern \\"epic fantasy\\", this about the same flavor (at least we aren't forced to read a trilogy---hurray!)<br />The novel slyly winks at the White Man's Burden concept inherent in writing about an extended Raj forced to move to India. Call it a propaganda novel for the \\"thousand year Raj\\". It's clear that Stirling knows what he's about here, even if his characters are trapped in the conventions of the Gilded Age.<br />At 500 or so pages, it was a bit hard to concentrate near the end, but Stirling is a good enough writer to make it fun. The pages turn and eventually you put it down having enjoyed it.<br />I've got to mention the title: the Peshawar Lancers appear on about 12 pages of the book. Still, that hardly distracts from a nice little romp.	2004-04-11

Gene Wolfe can be a frustrating writer: his prose is often elliptical, his plots and characters unusual, his text obscure and dense. He's a master of indirectness: he'll leave out what for other writers would be &quot;important plot points&quot;.<br />In this second volumn of Book of the Short Sun, we spend most of our time *not* in Green's jungles, but the intersecting plots and deft, subtle interplay of the different characters leave us with both a clear picture of the main character's (Horn/Silk) time there. We get crumbling cities, in-human (and human) monsters and other trappings of, say, a good Burrough's Barsoom tale presented entirely as backstory to the current events in which the lead character has become embroiled.<br />On Blue's Waters (the first volume) was a beautiful work, marred (I thought at the time) by the overly obscure ending. But this novel (a lot clearer to follow, with a more conventional linear story) actually improves the first book. I can't wait to read the final volume now...	2004-03-14

This is a lovely novel, the first part of a trilogy, with a strong link to previous novel sequences by the same author. The writing is distinctively Gene Wolfe's, bringing to my mind the often overlooked \\"Soldier of the Mist\\" (which really should be credited at the inspiration to a number of recent movies like \\"Memento\\" and a novel that you should run out and get if you've not read it). For one thing, this novel is written in the first person as if it were the chronicle of its purported protagonist and Wolfe is a strong enough writer to convey Horn (the protagonist's) point of view and still slip us some sly information about Horn and the story on the side. You do get the rich characters and foreboding landscape that Wolfe does so well.<br />The latter part of the novel suffers, though, from several flaws. For one thing, it is the first part of a trilogy and some really bizarre things apparently have happened to Horn that are alluded to, directly or indirectly, between the action that envelope Horn and when he is writing the book. This would be fine, if much of the latter half of the book weren't wrapped up in Wolfe's fascination with somewhat lumpy anti-drama and if some of the central conflicts of this book (especially with the inhumu 'son') were \\"on stage\\" instead of left in the shadows. The first 1/2 of this book are spell-binding and worth the price of admission and the escape sequence at the end is pretty good. I will certainly be reading the follow on books.	2004-01-01

It's not overly sophisticated and is sort of like the Cliff's Notes version of Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_. There are very modest amounts of real scholastic effort here, simply presented, about the Knights Templar and so on. The writing is remarkably flat in tone: reminiscent of, say, Adam Hall's Quiller novels. I can see how readers who come to this material fresh are fascinated, but having read the aforementioned Eco novel (and others with similar material), I found this effort pretty thin gruel in comparison. Despite the author's best efforts, this is a straightforward thriller (almost a procedural), with fairly flat characters. You won't care all that much about anyone here and you won't find the really deep mysterious material that others (especially Eco) explore elsewhere to better effect.<br />I guess I enjoyed the book, but only as a temporary diversion. Wait for the paperback: you'll read this novel in a couple of sittings and, if you're like me, will want something with more substance. In particular, the Bad Guys and the New Age Goddess vs. the Pope stuff is so rote as to be a parody of itself. Look for this one at your local Cineplex Oderama soon.	2003-12-28

But Stephenson is an insightful writer and a crafty devil to boot. If you liked Cryptonomicon, then you'll probably enjoy this work as well.<br />What tickles in this book is not the scintillating plot... mostly because there *is* no plot. It is all in the minor events and scenery that the characters devour, the amazing descriptions (from outlandish, foppish fripperies to the amazingly bad experiments of the Royal Society). The minute detail is all here and all well wrought.<br />In the past year I've read some very popular but very crappy long-series works of fantasy. This book (barely speculative fiction) walks back and forth over the prostrate supine works of morons like Robert Jordan.<br />But at the same time I'm a bit nervous. With two books in the offing, I don't exactly look forward to reading 3000 pages (nearly 10 normal novels) to get anywhere. Stephanson hasn't really disappointed in the past. And you could do far worse than this novel, even without a plot, for sheer joyful reading. But I'm holding my breath...	2003-11-17

Theroux does an excellent job of evoking the beauty, humanity, and joy as well as disappointment, sadness, and outright filth of Africa. As a travelogue it is fascinating.<br />My problem with the book is with the polemics. Alright, I'd like to know about the effects of the &quot;donor economy&quot; on Africa. I'd like to appreciate the problems that individual Africans face and how (or if) things have gone wrong. But Theroux gives us remote views of the targets of his criticism. He praises certain efforts from his period in Africa, during the 60s (and laments their ultimate failure). But he continually rubbishes current efforts in a dismissive way, without drawing us close enough to draw our own opinions. We're given his viewpoint, not shown the facts and allowed to draw our own conclusions.<br />Part of the problem here, though, is that he follows a singular path, which may in-and-of-itself be misleading. He doesn't follow up on the various donor organization that he dislikes so much. He could be entirely right. But then again, I have friends who have spent time in Africa on a humanitarian mission of one sort or another--an acquaintance is in Mauritius right now--and, well, yes, there is grinding poverty and other nasty things about life there. But it might not be entirely the fault of people in the white Land Rovers either.<br />And much of the criticism he makes of changes to places he's been before (fewer trees, uglier buildings, etc.) could be applied to many larger cities in the USA just as easily. Nostalgia for the bucolic past is fine, but these experiences must be also be measured against thirty years of change. <br />The verbal tsetse flies aside, here is the cradle of humanity presented as a huge human tragedy, a (not-so) glorious safari from end-to-end. As a travelogue it is engaging, a trip to faraway and exotic lands, filled with realism and often lurid detail. But a critical reading of his conclusions leaves a certain amount of doubt about them. I liked this book and recommend it as a diverting read. But you may find the constant theme a bit irritating.	2003-09-24

I bought this book on the strength of the Booknotes interview of author Bellow. I mean: how can you possibly end up praising nepotism? What's he got to say about it? The historical material is fascinating in the way that Bellow can show a different side or point-of-view for some famous (and some less famous) historical figures and how nepotism played into their successes (or failures). Less convincing is the set of conclusions he makes from his research. But I still enjoyed the book pretty well. It'll make a good paperback someday.	2003-09-24

I didn't expect much from it, so it was a pleasant surprise to get a decently crafted police procedural/detective story coupled with SF. This is a neglected form of science fiction and a good addition is a great blessing.<br />The book is a bit weak in some areas. The ending is a bit muddled. There are some gaps in this book's exposition that might be explained by the previous volume (which, thank heavens, is not at all necessary to enjoy this one). The writer is a bit more familiar with the mystery genre than with SF. The SF bits aren't very crisp and feel borrowed. The setting on the moon was handled more deftly, for example, in Niven's Patchwork Girl. <br />But there is a lot here to like. The characters aren't nitwits. The puzzle is pretty good. There's nothing sloppy about the book and the writing is genuinely gripping in many places. I recommend it and will go back and get the previous volume when I get the chance.	2003-08-03

I picked this book up along with Watt-Evans's _Dragon Weather_ for a recent vacation. The other book was captivating, this one wasn't.<br />For starters, this book felt a lot like a retread of other, better, novels. Another reviewer mentioned _War for the Oaks_, which is the one I immediately thought of as well. That's a much better book. But the parallels aren't that exact. Williams has done a couple of semi-original things here and I did end up reading the whole thing after reaching a point early on where I didn't want to read it. The sense of wonder about traveling to a sort of modernized fairyland is sorely missing, but the story does move right along. The ending is terrible--Williams gets his hero out of a difficult jam while he (and we the readers) are unconcious. Arg!<br />One last note: the hero in this book is a numbskull, which I find rather tedious.<br />This is an okay read, but not Williams's best work.	2003-07-14

Vacation time rolls around every so often and I like to stock up on some larger books. I got Dragon Weather because I had liked Watt-Evans earlier book 'Misenchanted Sword' several years ago. I didn't expect too much because the writer isn't as skillful as many of the big name fantasy or SF writers... and this book isn't a classic by any stretch.<br />But what I liked about _Sword_ I liked about this book too. The characters are 12 years old; they're not imbeciles; the story is somewhat original and fun to read. So I recommend this one pretty highly and I'll probably seek out the sequel I gather has been published (that's another reason to like this book--unlike many series published today, the book stands alone on its own)	2003-07-14

The characters in this v-e-r-y long, endless, weighty, unbending doorstop of a book are very hard to like. The boys are nitwits and I resent being stuck in the heads of rather thick people who do very stupid things over-and-over. The female characters come off somewhat better--Jordan goes out of his way to show them as strong and smart, but I think he overdoes it. It would be far better to see equally interesting and &quot;strong&quot; (strong doesn't have to mean &quot;perfect&quot;, you know) characters.

Michael Ruhlman had a lot of fun writing this, a set of three longer works about three chefs. Each vignette is well told and builds upon the delight and insight of the previous section. The first section covers a group of chefs taking the Certified Master Chef exam, focusing on one specific chef. The second on a chef in the mid-West. The third section focuses on Thomas Keller and the French Laundry.<br />The food sounds wonderful throughout the book and I enjoyed the insights into cooking that each section brought out. In a previous life I spent a good bit of time in a commercial kitchen, so this brought back a lot of interesting and fun memories, coupled with the delight of cooking.<br />If there's one section that I didn't appreciate so much, it's the last bit on Keller, where Ruhlman goes a bit too goggly-eyed over His Personal Hero the Greatest Chef in America if Not the World. ::sigh:: I'm sure the food was outstanding, but it seemed to go on a little too long.

Thank goodness Vinge isn't one of these annoying authors who has to plaster an epic across THREE five-hundred plus page volumes! A Deepness is a pretty good book, if not exactly taut. Basically this book is Space Opera toned down enough to make it attractive to modern audiences. <br />Nonetheless, despite the a pretty well realized layer-upon-layer-of-betrayal plot and hokey anthromorphization of the aliens (behind which is a subtle betrayal by a human character which I won't give away here), this is a pretty thin gruel in several places.<br />This book won the Hugo, which gives you an idea of the quality of the writing, which is quite good. However, the total lack of characterization for the &quot;bad guys&quot;, flat characters, two or three extra (pointless) digressions and just endless explication would have made a much better 250 page novel.	2001-07-07

Niven's &quot;rationalization&quot; of some of Burrough's and Bradbury's material is nifty.<br />Sadly, I can't give this book a whole-hearted recommendation, though. If it were ONLY one or two classic Martian tales in play here, it would have been better. Instead the story gets bogged down with too many things to take care of and the beautiful ideas seem lost in it.

For a first time reader it would have been better if a lot of that stuff  got forgotten!<br />Also, there was too much sexual &quot;tension&quot; here  and it made it hard to care for most of the characters (starting from  zero).<br />The writing was fun, though.

It's a terrible shame, because Eddison's book features some of the best \\"playground\\" you're likely to find anywhere outside of Tolkein. The book is a bit odd---it's essentially the writer's adolescent fantasy-land turned into a novel and the writing form is now a bit antique---but there are so many good adventurous yarns embedded here that you're unlikely to ever forget it. From the doomed, treacherous Lord Gro to the wrestling to the evocative scenes with the basilisk, you be swept away by a fantastic world quite unlike so many modern \\"epic\\" fantasies. Oddly, I should add, that this is the equivalent of \\"The Hobbit\\" to a trio of novels (including the wonderfully titled \\"Fish Dinner in Memison\\" that are quite unlike it in tone and content.	1998-12-06
