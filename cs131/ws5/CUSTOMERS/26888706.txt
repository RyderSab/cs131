I did not find this book entertaining in any way. The hero's behavior is (admittedly) borderline psychotic. His abusive treatment of the heroine, soon spills over into his attitude towards his co-workers as well. It isn't until the heroine calls him on his toxic behavior, and explains how it is demoralizing to the whole office, that the hero receives his comeuppance, and he finally begins to grow up. Okay, fine. <br /> <br />However, I had issues with an unresolved subplot. The heroine's sister, Angela, is cut from the same rotten pattern as the hero --and yet nobody ever tries to call her on it! She is a castrating wife and borderline abusive mother. Her husband, parents, and sister are scared of her. Her oldest son, Tony, is a brat with disturbing tendendencies, (yet his behavior is laughed off as being that of a \\"little egotist\\"). And her younger son, Colin, is cowed. Angela has some serious issues with anger, and yet, no one ever tries to get her into the counseling she would desperately need in real life. (Indeed, the abusive hero even admires her! Significant?) <br /> <br />Yes, I agree that book is fantasy. It's just not a pleasant fantasy. I've just seen too many real-life dysfunctional families to enjoy this book. Read it if you want to see the kind of stories Harlequin Presents printed in the early 1980's -- stories that are different from today.	2004-09-03

The heroine, nurse Christina, is involved with a young man who (frankly) turns out be a fink. I'm glad that she got wise to him, and found true love with his older brother. Duert and Christina were subsequently featured with their growing family in another book, \\"A Girl Called Rose\\". I'd recommend this book, and I was rooting for the heroine, Christina, all the way!	2004-09-03
US	26888706	R33QM0G262ESHD	B00005WMT5	701451777	Pineapple Girl	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent romance with strong heroine	I think this is one of the best stories Betty Neel ever wrote. Particularly good is a scene near the end of the book where Eloise is serving as school nurse/matron at a boys' school and saves a small, bullied boy from attempting to jump from a ledge. The hero, Timon, turns up in time to help them both, but I got the impression that Eloise could have saved the boy even without the hero's timely appearance. (The school staff eventually handles the bullying problem in an intelligent way.) <br /> <br />Eloise is a strong-minded heroine who takes no nonsense from anyone, yet is properly compassionate to those who need it. She doesn't really need the hero to make her life complete. But how wonderful for her that he showed up anyway! I would definitely recommend this book!	2004-09-03

Jane Fox has many odds against her but manages to prevail. She is a hardworking nurse who is compassionate towards those in her care, as well as to her beloved pets. I found the part where she is working in a remote and understaffed hospital especially vivid, (and a good example of the effects of the nursing shortage).  <br /> <br />Thank heavens for the hero, Nicholas, and his timely intervention! Although he seems distant at first, he recognizes Jane's courage and strength, and falls in love with her. I'd recommend this book to fans of Betty Neels or anyone looking for a good romance book.	2004-09-03

She has decided, very early in life, that she is too plain for any man to want to marry her, so she decides to concentrate on her career. Then, she meets Dr. Dominic van Wijkelen while she is nursing an American woman in Holland. Dr. van Wijkelen is often cynical and impatient with Abigail. However, he also thinks highly of her as a nurse, always requesting her for his cases. But Abigail wonders if he will ever appreciate her as a woman....<br />I think this is one of Betty Neels's best books. Abigail is a strong heroine and an excellent nurse. This story also covers a wider geographical range than most of Ms. Neels' books, (which usually only are set in England and the Netherlands). Abigail's travels take her across Europe, particularly when she and Dominic are driving his small niece from Spain to Holland in order for the child to have an operation in Dominic's hospital. Dominic's occasionally snappish personality is offset by his obvious regard for Abigail's professional capabilities. This book is well worth reading by fans of both romance books and Betty Neels.	2004-04-23

After Maggy saves his mother's life during a heart attack, Dr. Doelsma is grateful, and invites Maggy to Holland to continue to nurse his mother there. Maggy accepts. She also is attracted to Paul. In addition to appreciating her professional capabilities, he is also one of the few men around who is taller than she is, (Maggy is six feet tall). But will Paul return her affection?<br />I liked this early Betty Neels book. Maggy is a strong heroine, who doesn't take any nonsense. She may (mistakenly) believe that she is unattractive to men because of her size, but she is never self-pitying about it, simply going on with her life and becoming the best professional --and person-- she can be. This leads into the greatest reward she can imagine. And of course, Betty Neels' colorful description of Holland is always a winning background. I would highly recommend this story.	2004-04-23

When she is invited to stay at her cousin Cissy Rountree's Main Line Philadelphia home for Cissy's debut, Prue is sure she will be uncomfortable there. However, Cissy and her parents are so warm and welcoming that Prue starts to relax and enjoy herself. Cissy's debutante party starts off beautifully, but near the end of the festivities, the Rountrees receive a tragic phone call: their older daughter Lea's husband, a pilot, has been killed in a plane crash.<br />Cissy goes to stay with Prue at the Fosters' farm for the rest of the summer while her parents bring Lea home from Holland where Lea and her husband had been living. During this time, the girls become friends, and both find romance: Prue with Colin Grey, a friend of Cissy's, who has a mutual interest with Prue in literature; and Cissy with Mac Price, a college student from Texas who has a summer job as the Fosters' ranch hand. <br />Then, Cissy, after swearing Prue to secrecy, confides that she and Mac are planning to elope. Prue worries about the hastiness of their coming marriage. How can she convince them to wait and do the right thing?<br />This is a sensitive, beautifully-written story. There are some wonderful scenes to set the mood: the excitement of the preparations for Cissy's debut; the sudden shock of the family tragedy; Prue's comforting Cissy one night after she finds Cissy weeping under a tree; and Prue's being torn between keeping Cissy's marriage plan secret and trying to prevent the elopement.<BR>The birth of a beautiful foal, Pandora, to Prue's mare, Feather, is a sensitive affirmation of the continuity of life. Although this book was written in the 1950's, it still touches emotions that are true today. Worth seeking out.	2003-11-14

They were killed taking Timothy and his older brother to one of Timothy's concerts. Now Timothy is traumatized, and unable to play the piano at all.

Lark herself has guilt issues with the drowning death of her father, and the two form an understanding bond. But Lark is also aware that Timothy is the younger brother of Revel Thorne, who deserted her at the altar. How can she help Timothy and continue to come into contact with Revel?<br />This was an entertaining story, with many levels. Lark is especially good with children. This leads to her planning to start a children's home, late in the book. And the misunderstanding that led to Revel's inital jilting of Lark is believably explained. Will they have a real chance at happiness? It's worth reading to find that out.	2003-11-12

Her duties are treat the various tenants who work and live there. The job is different from her previous hospital job, and occasionally exciting. Iris has two men in her life: Dr. Harry Marsh, who is separated from his psychiatrist wife; and George Morris, the son of the building's owner. George would rather be an architect than work for his father, but doesn't want to offend his parent. Iris encourages him to follow his dream. However, Iris herself cannot make up her mind which of the men she wants. Then, disaster strikes....<br />Sometimes, through no fault of its own, an otherwise good story can end up with unforeseen disturbing elements. In this case, the disturbing element is the plane that hits the skycraper. To be fair, this book was originally published in 1976; however, in a post-9/11 world, this scene may be hard to take. Readers may want to take this set-up into consideration before reading this story.	2003-11-12

But June is put off by the penny-pinching behavior of hotel manager, Ernest Brinkley. She also suspects that he may be swindling senile Dorothea Wayne out of her money in order to throw parties in her name. How will the truth come to light?<br />This was a decent, undemanding book.

Should she settle for the undemanding relationship she has with Irwin? Or should she admit her attraction to Angus, whose kisses make her &quot;sizzle&quot;?<br />This story was enjoyable. I particularly liked Gram, Doralee's wise grandmother, a former nurse who met her husband, a construction engineer in Yosemite National Park, and went on to have a long and happy marriage with him. (Gram obviously wants history to repeat itself!) The peaceful park setting is an ideal place for the heroine to heal and find herself again. Recommended.	2003-11-11

It describes each one's personal and professional struggles, (Roy as a cowboy actor of growing popularity who maintains a close family life; Dale as a divorced teenage single mom who rises through the show business ranks as a singer and actress). Once they appear together in the movie, &quot;The Cowboy and the Senorita&quot;, Roy and Dale have real chemistry together, and become a team. And later,when Roy, a widower with young children, asks single mother Dale to marry him, she accepts.<br />Problems occur when Roy's small children refuse to accept Dale as their new mother. Dale's grown son Tom --who has happily accepted Roy as his new dad-- attempts to resolve the situation by encouraging Dale to take the young children to church and Sunday School. Tom has found it helpful in his own life, and has the same hopes for his mother's situation. When Dale starts bringing the children to church, their lives begin to turn around. And not long afterward, when Roy and Dale's daughter, Robin, is born with Down syndrome, this faith becomes the light which sees them through their difficulties.<br />I loved this book. There are many wonderfully detailed vignettes of Roy and Dale's professional and personal lives: their wedding; their family life; their many friends; their show tours: the writing of Dale's book about Robin, &quot;Angel Unaware&quot;, and the blessings that this book gave to other people; their compassionate visits to sick and crippled children; and their integrity which extended even to the products associated with their names, (Roy refused to have his name on any shoddy or dangerous products). And, above all, there is the legacy of their Christian witness: Roy and Dale not only read their Bible, they lived by its teachings. They really were good guys.	2003-10-15

Jake is looking for a wife, and would like to have children of his own.<br />Bet and Jake do meet, (at first, disastrously --Bet mistakes Jake for a kidnapper, and hits him with a mop). They agree to a marriage of convenience: Bet will be a stay-at-home mother, and Jake will get the family he wants. They marry, and, on the surface, everything seems to be just as they want it. After all, each had been in love --and married-- before, so there's no need for that in a subsequent marriage, especially one that's intended as a &quot;business deal&quot;. But what Bet and Jake do not realize is how they will change and grow into this relationship. Will they understand that they can accept a deep, abiding love the second time around?<br />This story had many touching scenes, especially Bet's confiding to Jake about her unsettled life as a foster child and Jake's resolve to give her the security she never had before.

However, there are obstacles. <br />Carrie and Dylan have different ideas about how they want to have the play performed. Carrie wants some humor, while Dylan is more serious about it. They clash at rehearsal. And another --bigger- problem is that Dylan also wants to produce the play. This is a great financial risk, but Carrie is willing to help Dylan take it. They overcome these clashes, but then, the play flops in Boston. How will they triumph over this final hurdle?<br />I found this book entertaining. Carrie is a lively character, whose personality is well-balanced by Dylan's more serious nature. The show business background of the story is fun, with its disappointments and triumphs; and it builds to a believable (and romantic) conclusion. Recommended.	2003-10-06

In this book, fashion designer Addy and pediatrician Sam Kildaire have been married for five years. They have two daughters, Grendel and Bridget. Both Addy and Sam are successful in their careers. But the sudden marriage --and move to Tahiti-- of Addy's standby, Miss Pru, leaves Addy overburdened with her design business. Adding to the complications is the arrival in their household of Erin Simmons, who has tragically lost her family in a fire. Erin needs to stay with them until she recovers and can get back onto her feet. <br />Addy is so overwhelmed with the details concerning her upcoming fashion show that she has no time left for anyone or anything. Sam insists that she hire more help, but Addy insists that she can do it all herself. But how will this affect their marriage?<br />This was a fine book. I loved the scene with Addy's pregnant model, Pattycake, having an unexpected homebirth right in Addy's house. And the shared tragedies of Erin and Addy's friend and caterer, Hedda, help Addy to realize what's really important. Recommended.	2003-10-06

Catherine and Johnny meet and dance the night away at New York's Stage Door Canteen. They intially like each other, but Catherine is engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Douglas Weaver and plans to marry him after the war. However, everything changes after Catherine receives the tragic word that Douglas has been killed in action. <br />She and Johnny correspond by v-mail, and begin to form a friendship. Catherine also takes over her father's position as the head of Wilson Manufacturing.  Then, Johnny turns up, wounded and ill, on her doorstep on Christmas Eve; and Catherine nurses him back to health. Soon, they realize that they are in love, and become engaged. But Catherine wants to continue to work at Wilson, while Johnny wants a stay-at-home wife. How will they resolve their conflict over this?<br />This is one of my favorites of this series. The section dealing with v-mail between the characters --interspersed with newspaper dispatches and a reminder to reorder victory garden seeds-- adds an extra flavor and immediacy to the story. This book was followed by the 1950's entry, \\"Stranger in Paradise\\". I highly recommend both books.	2003-09-26

It is the lighthearted story of flapper Alice Fontaine and wealthy playboy Nicholas Crawford. Alice wants to become an actress and she crashes Nicholas Bradford's party in order to meet producer Tyler Bradford. Eventually, through Nick's help, she does. <br />Nick is taken with Alice, and their relationship, which starts out as fancy-free, soon becomes more than that. Though most of the story is fun to read, the last part of the book turns serious, as Alice and Nick realize that Tyler Bradford, an important figure in  both their lives by now, is involved in serious crime. How will this crisis end?<br />This book was fun to read. Standout scenes include Alice's promotional bubble bath outside Gimbels; and Nick and Alice's moolit rooftop picnic, complete with strawberries and champagne, (an intensely romantic scene).

Mac Weaver, an American reporter sent to England, to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, meets English journalist, Jane Townsend. After a whirlwind courtship, they marry and return to America to live. <br />Mac's parents and their best friends, the Wilsons, receive them with open arms. Mac and Jane settle into Levittown; Jane even becomes close friends with Nancy Wilson Sturdevant, Cathy's younger sister. (Catherine Wilson was the heroine of the previous book, \\"Sentimental Journey\\".)<br />Mac and Jane do their best to fit into suburbia, where everyone is expected to be exactly the same. They make plans to start a family. But when some of Mac's possibly \\"Red\\" newspaper articles come back to haunt him, and a book from Jane's \\"Socialist\\" uncle is regarded with fear by suspicious and gossipy neighbors, Mac and Jane contend with the dark side of 1950's America. How will they rise above their problems?<br />This book was wonderful! I liked the vivid details of everyday life in 1950's suburban America. There is also the concurrent story of Nancy and Gerry Sturdevant, and their three small daughters. The conflict here is that Gerry wants to leave Wilson Manufacturing, and open a drive-in movie theater, while Nancy is opposed to his leaving a steady job for an uncertain proposition. How they resolve this difference -- and find themselves again in the process-- makes for an extra-special read. And there's even a wraparound section featuring Mac and Jane's daughter, Liz, who may headed for a romantic encounter of her own. Highly recommended!	2003-09-26

It is set in 1997, but since the book was published in 1991, the year 1997 is considered the future here.<br />Lucy Beckwith is a computer systems designer who begins to receive romantic messages on her computer from \\"A> Loverboy\\". She has no clue who this is, but she begins to fall in love with this character as they communicate through her computer. At the same time, she has to contend with a new adversary at work, Jim Kazan. What will Lucy do when she finds out that \\"A> Loverboy\\" and crafty computer hacker Jim Kazan are one and the same? <br />At the same time, Jim has problems of his own. A teenage girl, Dara-Lyn Coker, has shown up in his life --and claims that he is her father! Dara-Lyn was conceived by sperm from the Mensa sperm bank. After her mother perishes in an earthquake that destroys the Watts Towers in LA (the \\"Big One\\"), Dara-Lyn jumps to the conclusion that this man who said he paid a visit to the sperm bank the year before she was born-- and who closely resembles her-- must be her real father. Jim protests that he was actually turned down by the sperm bank for being too young, but Dara-Lyn refuses to believe him. How will Jim convince her that he's not her dad?<br />I thought this story was lots of fun to read. While a few of the predictions obviously didn't come true --such as the Big One earthquake that was supposed to destroy Los Angeles-- the prediction that computers would become an important part of everyday life, was right on the money. And the new century dawns in the story on a note of hope, (no Y2K fears here). Recommended.	2003-09-26

Also,how much longer will Tom and Linda be able to postpone their plans for starting a family? (Fate takes a hand here!)<br />This was a pleasant story.

Their mutual attraction is deep. But Jennifer thinks Lij is too conservative, particularly about independent women, while Lij mistrusts Jennifer's hippie friends and lifestyle. After all, his wife Rona was killed and his daughter Amy severely brain-damaged in a car accident caused by one of Rona's hippie friends. Will they be able to overcome their very different backgrounds?<br />I liked this book. There are very thorough descriptions of the moon landing and Woodstock, (which brings back memories for those of us who are old enough to remember!). Also, there is surprising new hope for Amy's recovery during the course of the story. Recommended.	2003-09-26

She eventually finds a new love, Rauol Buchanan, a polo player.<br />Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. I felt that there was not a single believable character or situation in it. Luz is a proud woman, but she has almost too many strikes against her. Her husband, Drew, seems initially devoted to her, so it's difficult to understand why he leaves her for another woman, even though the other woman is a lawyer and Luz is not. The \\"other woman\\", Claudia, is a cardboard character; it's hard to see what the attraction is, beyond her and Drew's shared profession. Luz's son, Rob, is not an unsympathetic character; but he is also mixed up in promiscuity and drugs, which lead to scandal and tragedy for the family. And Luz's daughter, Trisha, is the worst character in the bunch: she is so rude and disloyal to her mother --even openly preferring Claudia to Luz-- that I was ready to slap her!<br />Also, it bothered me that the children addressed their mother by her first name, \\"Luz\\". I may be old-fashioned, but I felt this seemed disrepectful. But, on second-thought, maybe it's a family custom as Luz addresses her own mother as \\"Audra\\".<br />Janet Dailey is a delightful writer. Her \\"Harlequin Presents\\" romances were charmingly and beautifully written; and most of her longer books were good, also. (Particularly \\"Silver Wings, Santiago Blue\\".) But I guess even a good writer can come up with a clinker every now and then. Read any one of Janet Dailey's other books, and you'll see that she can be an entertaining author.	2003-09-25

My daughter's second-grade teacher read it to the class, and told me that my daughter loved it, so I went out and bought a copy. The relationship between the little girl and her grandmother is endearing. The recipe looks good. And I love all the farm animals. Perhaps, my favorite is Grandmother's cat.

The highlight of the book is when they track down a typhoid carrer in order to stop an epidemic. The town badly needs a hospital, though. Will the drastic circumstances of a hurricane open the people's eyes to this need?<br />This was a good, solid story. I liked the late-in-life romance between Martha Edgett and Elias Todd.

Life is peaceful. However, all this changes when Bill comes home from a fishing trip, suffering from pneumonia; and once he recovers from this, it is discovered that he has a small case of TB, and must go to a sanitarium for six months. Sue is upset, but decides to cope with the situation by going back to work. <br />She takes a staff nurse job at Springdale Hospital, and there she does the kind of work she likes best: direct interaction with the patients. There are many humorous vignettes involving the patients. But Sue worries that her fellow staff nurses may not accept her as one of them because she was once Superintendent of Nurses. And how will Sue's children --in the care of Sue's trustworthy housekeeper, Veazie Ann-- take to Sue's going back to work?<br />This is one of my favorite \\"Sue Barton\\" books. I enjoyed the description of holidays in the hospital, (Christmas, New Year's); as well as the subplot of the romance between student nurse Margot Harrison and young Dr. Frank Warren. (I did feel that Margot was a little too good for Frank, though!) Sue's trying to keep a balance between her career and homelife still resonates to working mothers today. Highly recommended.	2003-09-24

There are many vignettes, humorous and touching. Not all Sue's duties are medical. She helps a lonely Polish new mother find neighborhood friends; and she helps a kind old woman realize her dreams of travel, (Sue secretly donates the money she had saved for her own trousseau for the trip). This leads into a surprising reward for Sue herself.<br />This was a good story.

Sue is uneasy about her administrative role since she prefers hands-on nursing, but with the guidance of her staff, she carries the new job through to the best of her ability. Her natural warmth and interest in the students also help her to sort out their problems and personalities; from taming a sophisticated smart aleck, to guiding an unhappy nursing student into the teaching career the girl really wants. Meanwhile, Sue and Bill have to adjust to life together as a married couple, (learning about tolerance, for example).<br />I think this is one of the best &quot;Sue Barton&quot; books. Sue and Bill's long-awaited wedding is beautifully described. And the characters  really grow and develop during the course of the story. (There is also a nice surprise at the end.)Well worth the reader's time.	2003-09-24

Larry is forced to confess to Jenny about his and Ky's tragic break-up, and how he feels guilty for never having told Ky how sorry he was. He manages to apologize to Ky now, and wants to go on with his life, but Ky refuses to let go.<br /> Larry is flattered by Ky's attentions, but he wants to remain faithful to his wife. Jenny feels plain and dowdy beside the glamorous Ky. And the children, initially admiring of Ky, become confused at the turn of events. Will a near-tragedy involving Rick on a sailing trip finally set things right?<br />This was a wonderful story. The characters are complex. Larry is basically a good guy who suffers when he is torn between temptation and fidelity. Jenny is a strong heroine who cares deeply about her family; a quiet woman whose courage holds the family together. The conclusion of the story is right and deeply moving. Recommended.	2003-09-23

And Wade wants to move to California with their three children, while Glory prefers to stay in New York where her agent --and good memories-- are. Can their problems ever be resolved?<br />This story was entertaining, for the most part. It was creatively written, with interesting shifts between the past and present. Wade, the hero, is handsome and not totally inconsiderate of Glory's needs.<br />The only problem I had with the book was the heroine, Glory. She was just a little too edgy for my taste. I felt she often displayed a lack of tact and understanding in dealing with other people. If you can overlook the heroine's attitude, then you will find that the rest of the novel is worth your time.	2003-09-23

How will Sue resolve this issue?<br />This was a decent story. I'm afraid that I didn't find Sue's interlude in the operating room that interesting, (apparently, neither did Sue, for she decides against surgical nursing); but things start to perk up with the Christmas Eve dance, Sue's sojourn at the maternity hospital, and her turn as a head nurse where she comes up against an ethical dilemma, (should she report a flirtatious student nurse who neglects her work -- a course of action which might label Sue herself a \\"squealer\\"?).

But Sonia tells him that this doesn't really matter. How will she convince him that he didn't fail to protect her and that the mugger isn't all that important to their lives --or their recovery from the incident?<br />This was a very good story. Both Craig and Sonia are strong characters who each have their own ways of rising above adversity. One delightful development occurs when Sonia confides to a close friend that she is newly pregnant with Craig's child. This is a wonderful way to put the past behind them, and to concentrate on the future. You will want to stay with the story to see whether Sonia's love will help Craig overcome the past.

All the characters in this story are standouts: Annuzza's understanding mother, alcoholic father, kind older sister Kuza, pesky younger brother Puiu, wise grandmother Bunika, the old mountain man Drago, and Annuzza's hometown boyfriend, Marcel. They help Annuzza decide where she really belongs. I also enjoyed the description of Kuza's beautiful wedding. It may have been awhile since I read this book, but I'd still recommend it.	2003-09-21

She travels around the country and appears on talk shows. She meets many celebrities, from an Academy Award- winning actress to the Vice-President. Her income enables the family to move into one luxury apartment after another.<br />However, by the time she reaches the age of fifteen, Angie begins to tire of her career and would like to lead a more conventional life. One night, she sneaks out to a bowling alley, and meets a nice boy, Sam. She spends an evening with him and his friends, and discovers what it's like to be a normal teenager. Now Angie decides she's ready to leave her career. But can she convince her family that this is the right thing to do?<br />I read this story many years ago, but it still holds up well. Angie's show business career is initially fascinating; but I can see how the pace would be too much after awhile. Recommended.	2003-09-21

They have three young children: six-year-old Tabitha, and three-year-old twin boys, Johnny and Jerry. Sue has been happy at home taking care of their children, until she and her friend, Kit, visit their old nursing school, and Sue realizes how much she misses nursing. Is Sue's nursing training being wasted as a stay-at-home mom?<br />During the story, Sue gradually realizes that her training is being utilized in other ways. She does first aid for the neighborhood; and she uses her natural gift for helping people to try to bring her new teenage neighbor, Cal, together with the girl's mother, aloof artist Mona Stuart. But will all this be enough for Sue in place of her formal career?<br />This book has been a long-time favorite of mine. It also has the advantage of a pleasant New Hampshire summer as the story's background. Sue's career issues are still relevant today. Highly recommended.	2003-09-21
US	26888706	R19Q2QDDXEENDH	0451131037	536365215	Sue Barton Student Nurse	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Great story with exciting climax	This is the first of the \\"Sue Barton\\" series. In this story, Sue enters nursing school. She meets two girls, Kit and Connie, who become her best friends. And during their first year there, Sue learns the techniques of nursing as she is gradually moved from one department to another in the course of her studies. <br />One running concern the student nurses have, is whether they will have the courage to risk their lives in a life-or-death emergency. Sue is especially doubtful about this. Then, one night she herself is rushed into surgery for an emergency appendectomy. Then, while recovering on the ward, she suddenly comes up against a delirious patient who is trying to escape from the hospital. Can Sue stop her --even if the situation puts Sue herself into danger?<br />This is a wonderful story. Having been first published in 1936, some of the dialogue is a little dated, but otherwise, the story moves quickly and builds to an exciting and logical climax. Highly recommended.	2003-09-21

Griff has already had one unhappy marriage, and he has three children from that union: thoughtful eighteen-year-old Tom, rebellious fourteen-year-old Barbara, and adorable ten-year-old Tiger. Susan loves the children, but has private reservations about how to handle them.<br />At first, Griff and Susan's marriage is wonderful. They buy an old house and restore it. They go alone on a camping trip up north in their home state of Minnesota. But when Griff's ex-wife neglects the children one time too many, Griff gets a court order for the children's custody, and they come to live with him and Susan. Then, the peaceful  household is plunged into chaos. Susan also begins to have doubts about why Griff married her. Was he really in love with her, or did he just want a mother for his kids?<br />I found this story excellent and absorbing. Most of the characters are real and sympathetic. I found the description of Susan's bookstore particularly interesting. The boys, Tom and Tiger, are appealing characters.<br />The one fly in the ointment, (and which keeps this from being a five-star review), is the heroine's stepdaughter, Barbara. The girl is so obnoxiously hostile to Susan that after awhile, Barbara begins to lose reader sympathy, (even after Barbara excuses her attitude as a misdirected act of loyalty towards her own mother). Otherwise, I highly recommend this story; it's good on every other level.	2003-09-20

Two women are in love with him; the third is his adoring daughter.<br />Barbara, his mistress, is represented by the transitional 1950's. She moves from being a stay-at-home mother to becoming a divorced, ruthless business executive.<br />Evelyn, his wife, is a shy woman with no self-confidence who puts her husband and child first, mainly ignoring her own interests. Her backstory is the traditional 1940's.<br />Joy, Nat and Evelyn's daughter, represents the 1960's. Joy is a defiant free spirit who rejects her mother's lifestyle and attitudes. Joy is a daddy's girl who thinks her father can do no wrong --or can he?<br />The book's device of using each decade as a backstory to explain each character's attitudes is a good one. My only problem with the book was that Nat was such a self-centered jerk. He deserved more of a comeuppance. Otherwise, an interesting story.	2003-09-10

Their journeys are fun, and there is nothing Edeltraud loves better than dancing. However, Edletraud is increasingly plagued with ill health. When she has to have an emergency operation to treat a perforated ulcer, things go downhill from there: kidney stones,the eventual removal of a kidney, and finally, the dreaded diagnosis of Addison's Disease.<br />Edeltraud is a bedridden invalid until, in 1950, she makes the journey to Lourdes. The results are immediate --and miraculous. She immediately gains strength and able to eat again --even ice cream! Subsequently, as the title says, she makes a full recovery.<br />I loved this book. It is written in diary form, which gives the story a sense of immediacy. I also enjoyed the early stories of her dance tour, and the people she meets all through the book; Edeltraud makes each person she meets sound interesting. Recommended.	2003-09-09

Maria details how she met and married the Baron Georg von Trapp; loved and cared for his children; and went on to have three children of her own. The first half of the book is set against the background of pre-World War II Austria, with charming details of holidays and the annual Salzburg music festival.<br />Then the Baron loses his money; and the family uses their musical talents to earn a living. They become more and more successful, but when the Nazis invade Austria, the von Trapps must choose between material success (on the Nazis' terms) or freedom (and starting over) in America. Their choice proves to be an inspirational one.<br />The second half of the book deals with the von Trapps's new life in America. There are many comical scenes of Maria's struggle to learn English. And they also face the problems of continuing their careers in America, as well as dealing with publicity, agents, etc. But their faith in God sees them through all difficulties.<br />I really found this book inspiring. The von Trapps never gave up, even when they were tempted to, many times. They were --and are-- a strong family.	2003-09-08
