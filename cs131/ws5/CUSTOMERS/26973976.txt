Yes, parts of it are painfull outdated, and Ambler admits that in his introduction, but it was ahead of its time, and it is a great spy novel and adventure story.  It stars an unlikely secret agent, Professor Barstow, a middle-aged and overworked physics professor, who turns into Conrad Carruthers, debonoir agent determined to stop nuclear proliferation.  Alongside him in this adventure is a American reporter named Casey, and together they help the revolution in a fictional Balkan country overcome the evil aristocrats that want to use the A-bomb.  Given it was written in 1935, 10 years before the first A-bomb was ever used, but in some ways, it is realistic.  Very entertaining read.	2005-09-14

Almost everyone suffers, because a loved one is killed, or sent home hopelessly broken, in addition to the rationing and the taking of certain assets by the military.  Our heroine, Lizzie, tries to make her way through all of this, by first training to become a nurse, and when the actions of a spoiled rich girl sully her reputation, she joins a farming corps.

Charlie's voice in this looks like a novelization of what he had experienced while on the lam for a series of murders that he didn't commit.  There's hints of a large shadow conspiracy, which tend to be a part of bad or meriocre novels.  Most of the story is told by Charlie Morrell's lawyer, Rita Carr.  She's an ok narrator, but nothing great.  All in all, doesn't live up to the first two, but Charlie's riff on the Beatles song with \\"Once there was a way...\\" is brilliant, and the lone good part.	2005-09-07

The villain is too cartoonishly bad with almost silly taunting messages and \\"Oh, I am so clever of a serial killer, so I'll give you just enough infoformation to find out who I really am\\" e-mails.  The heroine isn't really memorable either, and has an obligatory boyfriend that never appears in the novel, just so we don't have the heroine and the dogged lawman get together.

After her \\"Beware of the Bouquet\\", Joan Aiken wrote something like five adult novels after that which all were too problematic to recommend.  With a \\"Cluster of separate sparks\\", finally she wrote another work that I enjoyed.  \\"Cluster\\" follows Daphne, a girl who goes to a Greek island looking for work that her icy but brillant cousin found for her, but things get complicated when the cousin is murdered and Daphne can't prove it; then her plane to Athens is hijacked by Arabs disguised as Orthodox priests, and then she is let off near the estate of a reclusive and rich man who cares for a number of children, some the unfortune children of the famous.  Our heroine falls in love with the rich man, but has to struggle with the fact that someone is trying to kill her.  Slowly, the truth about her cousin and her involvement in an international plot is revealed, and their is a climax near a swarm of massive butterflies.  Comic reading.	2005-07-07

Add to the mix Jonas Taylor, who is the Meg expert and knows his enemy well, and his oppertunistic wife that is also a reporter, and well, you can guess who will end up as sharkfood.	2005-03-24

Hanan Al-Shyakh's \\"Story of Zahra\\" is a bit muddled, and tries to be a feminist book, but it only manages to make Zahra look like a perpetual victim in an misogynist part of the world.  She flees her domineering, nasty father in Lebanon from her uncle that is conflicted about his feelings for his niece.  Then to escape her uncle, she marries a man whom she'll never love.  Then she flees to a war-torn Beiruit, and falls in love with a sniper.  Love, violence and death then ensue.  Frankly, I don't see why Arab nations had any fuss over this; it's not good enough to be subversive enough.	2005-02-19

Elizabeth Adler's \\"Legacy of Secrets\\" tries hard to be a good thriller and novel about buried secrets, but it doesn;t quite work, mainly because Lily is Adler's second-worst heroine(The worst as far as I know is Genie Reese of \\"Property of a Lady\\").  Lily grows up as a spoiled brat that had a close friendship with the O'Keefe boys, who work for Lily's father.  Then Lily falls in love with a cad, and the cad rapes her and frightens her into silence.  Lily becomes pregnant and blames Finn O'Keefe.  The Finn and his brother have to flee to America, and Lily is thrown-away to a distant reletive.  The rest of the novel consists of a descendent of Lily's trying to solve all the mysteries of the past, including the child that Lily rejected; and of how the O'Keefes and Lily both became powerful and wealthy.  The real villain isn't a surprise, and he is typically flat.  Almost as good as \\"Rich Shall Inherit\\".	2005-02-19

Isabel Allende's debut novel \\"House of Spirits\\" ranks up there with Chinua Achebe's first novel \\"Things fall Apart\\", and Keith Ablow's \\"Denial\\".  Allende tells us the multigenerational story of the Trueba clan, through the eyes of Esteban Trueba, the family's volatile patriach, who represents the best and worst of the old aristocracy of Chile, and through the information that Alba, Esteban's granddaughter, has put together through family diaries and such.  The novel has an unforgetable character in Clara, who is a clairvoyent and who marries the fiery Esteban.  Clara is a strong woman, even if she seems frail, and for all of Esteban's sound and fury(and he has plenty of both), she is the one that dominates that relationship.  This story is told through almost eighty years of tragedy and truimph for Chile(in the book, the South American country isn't named, but we know it's Chile).  The sins of Esteban will eventually come back to torment his descendants as the book climaxs with the bloody coup, where we see some of the most graphic scenes in the book.  This is quite an adult book, but every high school senior should have to read this.  Despite Esteban's numerous failings, I still found every character in this story riveting and understanable.	2004-12-20

Rochelle Alers's \\"Hidden Agenda\\" was an improvement over the last book of hers that I read \\"Careless Whispers\\", but the sotry was way too inplausble for me.

The ex-husband went down to Mexico, and is heavily connected.  It's up to Matt to find the man, and brign home the child, while Eve and Matt are married in a marriage of convinance, but lo and behold, they fall in love and wish for it to be real.

That is one of the few positive thigns I have to say about \\"Gifted Trust\\", a graphic, unappealing, amateur-hour horror book about an evil disembodied spirit named Virago(or Hellhound as it translates).  Virago follows different souls through the years: a publisher in the early 30's; a serial killer who also rapes his victims and often kills children and their mothers; and a gay high-school teacher at an \\"alterantive\\" school.  There are too many typos in the book, and the plot becomes hard to follow, and the coda is superfluous.  The serial killer passages are the best of the book.  Allen sure captures a sick and perverted mind well.	2004-11-15

The family tree helped matters, but I still couldn't really give a crap about this dysfunctional family.  By the end, I was glad the cops came and forced Jesus to leave, and I never felt so disappointed in a novel.  This claims to be great African-American fiction, instead it's an overhyped \\"novel\\" with overuse of \\"urban\\" lingo.	2004-11-02

He sends up a celebrity named Michael James, who is really a Jordan with a name change and a height change.  James is killed by a freak accident, or so everyone thinks.  Back on earth, Scott is sued by the family of the basketball star, and he ends up being defended by his ex-wife, who is the only one willing to take up his case.  Meanwhile, his brother tries to finish a new type of rocket that doesn't need those detachable boosters.  Soon, they all find themselves in the midst of an international plot, as a powerful nuclear bomb is set off in the atmosphere, and it is up to the Blackstones to rescue some astronauts stranded in the I.S.S(International Space Station).

Now, the novel follows Rachel Benjamin, who we know is much like the author, who at the start of the novel is at bat mitsvah age(12), and she is starting to question her parent's traditions.  She grows into a fairly modern Jew, who loathes matchmaking and loves the ways of the \\"Goyishe\\".  The father is a hopeless dreamer, a rebbe without a following, who is constanly put down by his wife, who does a very drastic thing at about page 100.  As ohter reviews have said, Abraham uses some of the real names for fictional situtations which is a big no-no.	2004-10-26

It makes the reader initimate with Cambridge, and shows a fascinating world of the Society of Friends(Quakers), but this fails as a mystery.  Why?  Because there wasn't much suspense here, as we figure out quickly that the homeless man isn't guilty, and when we find out who the killer is, we are disappointed because of the accidental nature of the killing, and we are left to wonder what will happen to him.

I would feel bad for Deckle's predicaments more if I didn't feel he was such a loser that needs to grow up.  Allen sure knows more about kosher butchering than the average joe.

Alex Abella pulled off an impressive trick with his first novel \\"Killing of the Saints\\".  He manages to write both a good courtroom thriller in the style of John Grisham, and a interesting ethnic novel that makes us question our narrow views on Hispanics, and Cubans in particular.  Abella has certainly taught me that here.  In this rich, and delightly noir novel, Charlie Morrel is a disgraced former lawyer who ran away to Los Angeles to escape his past, abandoning a wife and child in Miami where he almost was disbarred.  Charlie then finds himself drawn into a complex legal case involving two known killers who may not have been responsible for the carnage they inflicted in a jewelry store robbery gone bad.  Abella weaves the courtroom scenes with cynical judges and crusading prosecutors with the darker scenes with the believers of Santeria, a mix of Catholic and West African religion.  All of this leads to a surprising climax where the supernatural unexpectly shows up.	2004-10-07

David Aikman's alternate history novel(At the time of its release it had an alternate near future, but I'll call it an alt history) is better than I thought it would be when I read the first dreadfully slow pages.  It manages to make me like the \\"hero\\" Douglas Ritchfield, a man of little princple who begins through the actions of a young woman to believe in something for once in his life: rebellion against a tyrancial, collectivist regime.  The way in this regime comes into power is ridiculous at best, and Aikman should have known better.  Also the way a ultra-right-wing Russia is involved strains credulity.  This could have been overcome, but Aikman then decided to go for one of the most Byzantine and contrived climaxes I have ever read, where the hero sneaks in a very cryptic message refering to an obscure Bible passage that happens to be the name of a very secret project involving nuclear submarines, and then..somehow the submarine crew knows EXACTLY how to interpret this cryptic message.

On baord, he mets Violet Rymer, who is under the thumb of her overbearing, control-freak father, and he meets the mysterious Genevieve Mansfield, who is running from her shady past.

This book really does take us through Helen's turbulent life, but manages to make us wonder where this is taking place.  As far as I know, it's Northeastern U.S, in some place named Port Zebulon, but other than that..no feel for really where this is.  That really killed it for me.

This book is entirely plot-driven, and we really don;t give a fig about Hilarion and Claire-Heureuse, who are poor Haitians caught in this maelstrom.	2004-08-11

Jason Martin, the Post reporter, finds a naive, but attractive young woman named Dorothy Curtis to seduce six powerful men in Washington, and use the information they inadvertly provide to suit his ends. Soon, the conspiracy unravels, and Dorothy is found dead under a bridge known for suicides. This is where Fiona Fitzgerald comes in. Fiona is determined to learn the truth about Dorothy as her personal life goes to pieces due to her affair with the husband of a Congressial aide. Eventually, Fiona and Jason clash, and the American Sextet will do anything to cover up their connection with Dorothy. A bit tame nowaways, but this book was written pre-Gary Hart and pre-Clinton.	2004-08-06

Sherman Alexie's thriller &quot;Indian Killer&quot; has many glaring weaknesses, and only a few strengths. Firstly, many characters are unrepentingly racist. A ex-football player and a Rush wannabe represent the white racists, while Marie, a Native American activist represents the Indian racist. Marie is so racist, she makes an argument that goes like this: only Indians should teach Indian studies, only african-americans should teach African studies. of course, if you finish that foul thought to its logical conclusion, then only white people should teach western civilization. So, this is Alexie's biggest flaw: Aaron and Marie are two sides of the same coin, and he doesn't seem to realize this. Secondly, there are no heroic characters to root for, everyone is either victim or victimizer. You pity Mather, John Smith, and Wilson, all for different reasons, and you find yourself loathing Reggie, Marie, Truck and Aaron. The book's sole strength is its realistic portrayal of alienation with John as the Indian without a tribe, and with his worsening schizophrenia. Note, schizophrenics are most harmful to themselves, and to those who try to help them the most. As for the killer, it's not John, as some reviewers have said. I don't think Alexie would stoop to having an archtypical killer(that's a cheap copout, and would merit only 1 star if he really pulled that stunt). Personally, I feel Reggie is the killer.	2004-08-05

Aidoo gives new meaning to the term &quot;female whiner&quot;. Her brief &quot;novel&quot;(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream.

The plan: fake a kidnapping, so the hero can stay in school. It was a noble plan, but someone decides to make it real to achieve his own ends.

The book itself is easily 100 pages too long with a kind of dumb heroine in the present time(Genie Reese). Genie's actions in this novel could have easily killed her, especially one you learn her secret connection with the other heroine, Missie Abrams O'Bryan(aka Verity Byron). Missie is an admirable woman, who survived through the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression. She also knows all the Ivanoff secrets which a megalomanic German and a sadistic Russian will kill to get. Almost all the main characters in the novel have multiple identies, and this is an interesting part of the novel, but the prose is a bit flat, and Genie is just plain unlikable, which is this novel's fatal flaw. The previous book &quot;Rich Shall Inherit&quot; was better.	2004-07-21

Hannah Alexander's &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; introduces us to Dr. Lucas Bower, a Christian doctor who is trying to start over in the small town of Knolls, Missouri in the Ozarks. He runs into problems however, as a envious doctor named Jarvis George has it in for Dr. Bower, and tries very hard to have him fired. Dr. George is a good example of what envy can do to a person. Dr. Bower also makes a few other powerful enemies by doing what he knows is right, including the drug seeking son of a prominent attorney. Dr. Bower is helped out by a sympathetic administor, and another doctor named Mercy Richmond, who is trying to get her daughter back from her alcoholic ex-husband who is also abusive. Alexander makes sure that we don't feel preached at, and Christians are portrayed realisticly, as Ivy and Dr. Bower vehementlyu disagree on the DNR issue, but share the same evangelistic belief.

Basically, Elena Jr.'s lover finds out that the mother is still alive, and not killed in Africa in 1975.  Then, Elena goes to New York and then Kenya on a whim.  We met a stoned, confused man named Forester who was Elena Sr.'s lover.  Then we are bored to death, and cannot care less what happens to the whiny heroine.  Next time, Ahl should create a character we can actually relate to.  The novel takes its title from a 1975 Dylan album, the perfect title that a poseur would use.	2004-07-19

Bruce Alexander's(psuedonym of the late Bruce Cook) &quot;Blind Justice&quot; read in some ways like a Golden Age mystery, with characters that are not as they seem, and a very observant detective.  The detective/hero in this novel is an actual historical figure Sir John Fielding(half-brother to the author of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;), who co-founded the Bow Street Runners, a small constablary that became Scotland Yard in the 1820s under Sir Robert Peel.  The action here takes place in 1768 London, an uneasy era in British history due to the events that would take place in the next following years.  A lord is found shot, but the narrator and Fielding's sidekick Jeremy Procter helps to rule out suicide.  Soon, Fielding and Proctor discover that the lord was poisoned before being shot, and they find a secret passageway.  Various events converge as Fielding(who was blind) lays a trap to catch the killer.  Very good history, and OK prose.	2004-07-09

Abbey does have some good points, like we should stop trying to pave over things to make it more convineat to see nature.  The whole Glen Canyon tragedy is told, foreshadowing the novel &quot;Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;.  I did like his wide knowledge of philosophy and the desert fauna and flora, and I relate to his love of the desert, but his prose is a bit(forgive the pun) too arid, and I had to slog through parts of the book.

Richard Abanes has managed to do what very few authors have done.  He annoyed me to the level of giving his book only 1 star.  Only a couple of others(Kobo Abe, Kathy Acker, and Lydia Adamson) have managed that dubious feat UNTIL NOW. <br />Abanes basically wrote a 200 something page screed against Harry Potter, and J.K Rowling.  He contradicts himself through, giving mixed messages about Rowling's character.  He takes parts of the books completely out of context, so it would make Harry look the worst.  He goes off the deep end with mentioning real-life occultists that the average pre-pubbescant wouldn't have the resources or the mindset to look up.  He completely doesn't understand the average 11-year old, and makes Harry look like a poor role model(which is debatable) because he acts like a typical 11-year old.  <br />Some chapters digress totally away from Harry Potter, and get into Satanism and dark occultic practices that have NOTHING to do with Rowling or Harry Potter, but have everything to do with fanatics and the most wholy evil of us. Bad writing and poor apologetics.  Abanes should stick to anti-Mormon books, and leave critiques of children's literature to one who can only think for himself.	2004-07-01

In this story with quite an original plot, Holly receives ten envelopes with instructions from her recently deceased husband, who planned quite a bit in his last few months of life.  Holly is about to embark on a journey that will change her and her friends forever.  The tasks that Gerry has for Holly are great, ranging from singing karoake to more practical things like buying a lamp so she doesn't stub a toe.  While the plot is good, the characters tend to be annoying, and flat.  You only see Holly change somewhat, and you see her older brother Richard undergo some changes.

Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes wrote the long, but quite thought-provoking science fiction story &quot;Encounter with Tiber&quot;.  At almost 600 pages, it takes a reader at least a couple of days to trudge through the story, especially the early highly technical parts of the story.  Aldrin essentially predicted commerical space travel, and from the news, we may not be far off from the scenerio that Aldrin and Barnes present here.  The story is told through five different narrators with three humans at various points in the 2lst Century, and two &quot;Tiberians&quot; who came to Earth(or as they called it Setepos) in ancient times.  Basically, the message is that science and space exploration takes time and commitment, but it's worth pursuing.  The novel leaves the reader wanting more, as Clio(an astronaut traveling in the late 21st Century) discovers that her journey is just beginning.  It leaves room for a sequel, which depending on your attitude towards the story is good or bad.  I enjoyed this rich novel, and recommend this for anyone who really wants to know why we should try to go to Mars.	2004-06-28

It fails to be entertaining, and it uses references that only a South American could understand or relate to.  This is not good if you want to reach a general audience, which I assume is Alegria's intent.  Allende is portrayed as a complicated, stubborn, heroic man who tried to reform an unfair system, and was destroyed for it.

Anyway, Alcorn paints a picture of a liberal journalist surviving a car &quot;accident&quot; that killed his two best friends, Dr. Greg Lowell and Finnegan &quot;Finney&quot; Keels.  As you expect, Doc and Finney had opposite views of Christianity, and Alcorn depicts their respective fates as according to Scripture.  This is the true part.  The false because they are misleadly simple areas are the author's abortion scenarios(a morally complicated problem in reality) which boil down to &quot;in every case, a mother must give birth to a living child&quot;.  This ignores the complex nature of the debate, which I won't discuss here.  Also, the author has a &quot;homosexuals are free to change&quot; approach that doesn't work out well in reality.  Alcorn does get some journalistic ethos right, and I admire his honesty about that, but he paints liberals with a broadbrush(Jimmy Carter, a DEMOCRAT, is a very godly man, despite what the author may think) that is factually inaccurate.  The book only musters 3 stars, because while the action is great, the story is overly preachy, and makes weak arguments.	2004-06-09

The story follows Martha Gilroy, a coywriter for an ad agency who is still smarming from her husband abandoning her seven years before.  Her boss gets a new client, a chemical company going upscale with a new, almsot irresistable perfume.  Martha is in charge of shooting ads with the daughter-in-law of the CEO of the perfume company.  Soon, Martha gets involved in a baby kidnapping when she discovers an up-ended carriage when she gets lost while driving.  With great humor, we are taken on a ride as Martha tries to figure out who and why a baby was kidnapped.  The villian here is quite obvious, but the way Martha figures things out is amusing, and there is a great scene where she throws a hot soup canister at a bad guy.	2004-06-09

Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\", first published in 1868, is a classic book that espouses good Christian values.  It is a feminist in character, but is comforting to both men and women of all ages.  This is the story of four sisters of the March family: Jo, Beth, Meg and Amy.  All of them grow as the novel progresses, some more than others.  But there is heartache as one of the sisters slowly dies.  Alcott also used a \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" theme for the early chapters, and that works very well.  This is where we know that the novel tries to teach us moral lessons, but it is done subtly, and we enjoy the exploits of Jo and the neighbor Laurie, and later Jo's relationship with Professor Bhaer.  Highly recommened novel.	2004-06-09

Mark Aarons and John Loftus wrote a comprehensive, if a bit dry book on the secret activities of the Vatican, the Allies, and the GRU(Soviet Military Intelligence) during World War 2, and its aftermath.  Basically, the Vatican and the West played Germany and Russia against each other in some instinces, while fighting Nazism in others.  The Vatican, especially, helped many Nazi collabarators escape Central and Eastern Europe as detailed in the book.  This book shows how many people in the intelligence community did despicable things because they feared the Communists.  Despite the anonymous one star reviews for this book, Aarons and Loftus tell the truth as evidenced from numerous documents that were inadvertiatly declassified.  Thanks to them, justice will finally come to some.	2004-06-09

Aarons and Loftus did a lot of research for the controversial, but true \\"Unholy Trinity\\".  It is a bit too dry, which is why I can only give it 3.5 stars(I rounded up).  The authors show us that the Vatican helped thousands of Fascist collabarators because they thought they were choosing the \\"lesser evil\\".  As the authors show, everyone in the West was in on it, and we all(perhaps rightfully) feared Communist Russia.  The Russians though, infilterated these \\"ratlines\\" so many of these \\"fascists\\" were actually Reds.  Fascinating study of the darker side of the end of World War II.  The thought of so many Croatian butchers escaping justice is chilling.	2004-06-07

This one takes place about a year after the first book.  A firebrand teleevangelist targets Rudy Wilcox as being a witch.  China, of course, comes to her friend's defense.  But the preacher is the least of their worries.  Someone is killing animals for ritual, and soon, a woman is murdered after being sent the &quot;Death&quot; card.  Ruby comes under suspiction as her tarot knife was the murder weapon.  There are a few suspects, including the woman's husband, a real-estate developer with a cash-flow problem.  China and Rudy strive to find the killer, and nearly get killed in the process.  The identity of the killer is shocking, and as is the motive.

It is a bit inspired by the &quot;Crying Game&quot;, but it is original, and Albert had a lot of guts to do it.  Otherwise, this novel is average in plot.  A disbarred lawyer is hired by the family of a lawyer who disappered seven years before to invesigate his disappearence so he can be declared dead for insurance purposes.  What is discovered is that the mob wants some property that the missing man supposedly had.  Soon, the man's sister helps our hero to try and find the truth.

Albert obviously knew a lot about the climate of Europe then, and we are told that Ben Jahra would probably only face about a year in jail if caught.  Anyway, ben Jahra works with the Libyans, and after botching an airline bombing, he is determined not to fail again.  Both men are headed for a collison where only one will survive.

Suffice to say, Enid isn't that glad to have Harold around; she's afraid her lover Archie won't like Harold.  Added to the mix is the sudden reappearence of Enid's father(and Harold's grandfather) Abe, who is dying.  Harold learns some things about himself, but everyone in the novel is frankly unlikable and dull.  Albert doesn't help things by making us want to yell at Enid.

China, a former lawyer who burned out, is now a herb store owner in Hill Country Texas(an area of Texas north of San Antonio and west of Austin).  One of her friend's Jo Gilbert dies in an apparent suicide, but China's best friend, Ruby Wilcox, sees foul play.  Soon, China and Rudy find out about the secret life of a popular actress on a children's program(a Barney clone).  Murder and theft are committed, and China has to unravel all the lies being told.

Zoo Story(his first), an amateurish two-man drama, where one is a raving psycho and the other is a man drawn in and then repulsed.  That would get only a star.  &quot;Death of Bessie Smith&quot; is a message play, where racism is just oozing from most characters.  It critizes, and it is ugly, but yet..feels so empty.  Perhaps it is because Bessie never speaks for herself, only her paramour does pre-accident.  Finally, &quot;The Sandbox&quot;, which is the only good play in the book.

Then, two thuggish gangsters appear, wanting a stash of jewelry that Bernie( the Naker Liar/dead guy of the title) had on him.

Unfortunately, it feels contrived, and that's why I could only give it 3 stars.  Leonie is very young when she goes to Paris to find a living.  She comes across many men, eventually befriending those who would play a paly in her destiny.  Her first friend, Maroc.  Her best friend and protector, Caro Montalva.  Her first love, Rupert, who abandons her to marry into money.  Her obcessed lover, Monsieur le Duc, Gilles de Cormont, who is quite controlling and throughly ruthless.  Leonie then has a contrived encounter with a French count, and she becomes pregnant.  What Gilles does in reaction to this isn't surprising, and thus, Leonie has to give away her child, so she could be free of the evil Duke's machinations.  There are a lot of coindences in this novel, many near-meetings, and by the 400th page, all of this feels very contrived, and you think nobody can have that kind of luck.  I did enjoy how Adler ended it.  It was fitting, to say the least	2004-05-13

I did like Peach, I loved Leonie in this book, and I thought Noel was likable.  The story tells us of Peach's and Noel's struggles to overcome obstacles against them, her polio and his background.

Soon, Wilcox discovers that Kate's cousin, who looks like a Santa, is not what he appears to be.  The revelations are hardly shocking, but it is an enjoyable period mystery, with references to the Great Depression(I think this one is set in 1933).

It is good enough to recommend reading, but it has some flaws that prevent it from being great.  Adams's books tend to be feminist, which this book definately is.  I do like Megan and Peg, who both become rather feminizied by the end.  Adams also likes to portray sex.  Lots and lots of sex.  This book doesn't disappoint, that way.  I did find Megan a bit annoyingly neurotic.  Peg has the best transformation: from overweight, unsure girl to confident lesbian activist.  The \\"bitchy\\" one, Lavinia, reaps the whirlwind, which is satisying.  And Cathy wrestles with her faith, and is deal a bad hand.

It seems that Thomas Chatterton may have survived much longer than the world thought he did, and not only that, but he &quot;ghostwrote&quot; a lot more than we thought he did.  Thrown into the mix is Harriet Scope, an elderly novelist, who is a secret plagarist(she rips off fourth-rate Victorian novels).  Told from three different times: the 1770's through Chatterton's eyes; 1856 through George Meredith, who was the model in the famous painting of Chatterton; and in the present day, this novel explores just how far fakery can go, and the question if poetry really matters.

I can see from previous reviews that opinion was mixed.  I did like what Ackroyd attempted: a story with an eighteenth century feel( The language in that part got on my nerves after a while) with an interesting antihero at the center.  The premise that Nicolas Dyer, who designed churches, was a Satanist is both ironic and very original.  That is one of the few strong points in the novel.  The police detective who is investigating a series of murder is also interesting.  Basically, he discovers that the killings are supernatural and echo Dyer's murders years before.

But he finds that he isn't strong enough to overcome the past, and his people.  He falls into weakness, and he is punished for it.  We are left shaking our heads at how it all went wrong, and  we also feel ripped off by the protagonist's ultimate weakness.	2004-05-07

I came away befuddled.  I guess we were supposed to learn that a man cannot overcome his village, but still..I didn't get how it could have ended like that.	2004-05-07

This was singuatly the worst example of slaughtering trees needlessly.  The plot is not worth discussing(I couldn't really follow it anyway), the book is mainly a screed against men and its readers.  Inane dialogue and no feeling of setting.  Calling this anything but a waste of paper would be a travesty<br />By the way, the neo-Dadaist reference is to an art movement in the '20s to &quot;destroy&quot; art by flouting conventions, and that is an apt analogy for this book.	2004-05-07

Gil Renard is an unforgetable, but unlovable charater in Peter Abrahams's &quot;The Fan&quot;.  He is slowly simmering over the crap that other people give him, with stupid bosses selling crappy knives and blaming him for them not selling.  His ex is also shrewish, and he tries to relate to his son, but fails.  Soon, Gil finds himself getting closer to a star hitter for the Sox(a unnamed city, but we know he's talking about Boston), while Gil himself starts descending in murder and theft.  The commentary about Sox Fans is mostly true, and the ending is definately out of science fiction.	2004-05-05

Basically, Doddie and Jim are reunited and have to solve another mystery.  They do get to the bottom of why all these chefs are dying, but it is uninteresting, save a plot device involving lesser known uses of olive oil.  Jim also says &quot;yeah, buddy&quot; to a gratitious level, and I was not amused.  That, and &quot;damnit to hell&quot; were overused, and it shows that Abresch's writing is thin.	2004-05-05

Eddie Nye is almost likeable, as a newly released prisoner, who served 15 years for a crime he didn't committ.  We slowly learn how he got himself into that mess, and we learn that things are not as they seem, with Eddie's brother, for instince.  The subplot about Nye trying to figure out about &quot;Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is interesting, but doesn't compensate for the weak ending.	2004-05-05

She crosses paths with another Jewish man with a dark past, and who is the key to the whole conspiracy.

Set a few years after &quot;Projection&quot;, Dr. Clevanger is out of doing forensic psyichiatry due to the events at the end of &quot;Projection&quot;.  His friend, North Anderson, calls him to for help on a infant murder case on Nantucket.  The adopted son of a mogul is the prime suspect, and it is up to Dr. Clevanger to asset if he is really the guilty one.  Major twists and turns about.  The Bishop family in the book, are for the most part, flat.  Both Darwin and Julia have few redeeming qualities, and you feel badly for the adopted children, Garrett and Billy.  The end was great, as Dr. Clevanger moves into a new role.  You will be surprised at who the killer really is.	2004-05-04

After reading all four in the Clevanger series, &quot;Projection&quot; is the weakest of them, but still is a good book.  It follows up the events of &quot;Denial&quot;, and it feels like Ablow is trying to neatly wrap up the mess at the end of &quot;Denial&quot;.  Basically, Dr. Lucas, the slimebucket plastic surgeon from the first book, is in prison, and goes over the edge.  Dr. Clevanger knows that Dr. Lucas didn't do the crimes that he was put in prison for(*you have to read Denial to know how he knows this*), and so there is some tension when he is called to help negoiate a hostage sitution where Lucas and a band of psycho patients take over the prison hospital.  The violence is overdone(which I felt was the weakest point), but Clevanger's investigation of Lucas's past is well done, and we first meet North Anderson, who is important to later books.  The ending was a bit of a letdown, but it does neatly tie all the loose ends up, and leaves a blank slate so to speak for &quot;Compulsion&quot;	2004-05-04

Instead, the narrative is muddled, as everybody is double-crossing someone, and Jimmy Chiasson isn't believable.  Abel does a great job describing the atmosphere of the Crescent City, but his characters all seem the same.  Chiasson also survives a few encounters by dumb luck(or is it deus ex machina?).  The ending also ruined it for me.	2004-04-30
US	26973976	RW7JF606S2EVL	0312965966	203999838	Denial	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Great debut novel, and fantastic psychological thriller.	Keith Ablow creates an unforgetable character in \\"Denial\\" with Dr. Frank Clevanger.  Clevanger is a brillant forensic doctor who is approached by an ambitious police commish to solve a heinous murder.  Through the novel's many twists and turns, we see Clevanger is an impaired physican, who uses cocaine and has sex with strippers.  The City of Lynn is described very well, and truthfully.  Along the way, there are a few very disturbed suspects, but the truth isn't revealed until the very end.  I was very surprised at who the killer was, and even more surprised at Clevanger's obstruction of justice.  It ended perfectly, as this didn't read like a Hollywood thriller.  Also the insight of Clevanger's stripper lover are quite deep, as it gives one a new perspective on original sin.	2004-04-30

After reading &quot;Fool's Progress&quot;, I began to become interested in Edward Abbey's other books.  So I read &quot;Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, probably one of his better known ones, and I came away from it quite disappointed.  Yes, I know it was the 70's, when it was written, but did we really need a stereotypical J.A.P feminist and a flat ex-Green Beret, who loves violence and to litter.  The sentiments that the dam at Glen Canyon ruined the Colorado seem right, but that was the book's only strength.  By the time I got to the end, I didn't care what happened to the characters, although I give it credit for not being a &quot;hollywood&quot; ending.	2004-04-29

This was Abbey's second-to-last novel, and should be known as his swan song.  It is about a dying man, and his journey backwards through time and space, to his beginnings.  Harry Lightcap is definately not a &quot;politically correct&quot; character, but he is a deep thinker, and a free man.  This book is unsentimental, and a bit funny.  I definately recommend reading this book.	2004-04-29

A survivualist tries to find &quot;crew&quot; for his underground &quot;ship&quot;.  Various odd things happen, some including crude toilet humor, and nobody cares what happens.  I hated this book by the time I was finished.  It isn't the very worst book I've read, but it's close.  Only read this if you're a masochist.	2004-04-29

This book is told through the eyes of Sally Jackson, both in 1946(where she is to help bring Nazis to justice) and in flashbacks in 1933, where it tells of what went wrong between her(then a naive daughter of the U.S Ambassidor) and her lover Christian.  We can kind of see certain plot twists coming, and there are a few scenes that made me question Sally's intelligence.  The villian, Heydrich, is really creepy, and the story ends as it must.	2004-04-29

Double-crosses and triple-crosses soon come, and Sami is in a game where rival Iranian originzations use him to further their own power.

Both the U.S.S.R and U.S wish to stop him, for their own purposes.  The chase is cliche, but the book's strength is in how it portrays how American politicans use circumstances to further their own agenda.  The Soviets here are more than just one-dimensional heavys, but they are still not interesting.  It must have been scary for its day though.	2004-04-28
