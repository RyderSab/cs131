The tension was there and that is what I look for in a suspense.. Rarely does suspense have gushy romance running along side it....I don't like it which is why I enjoyed this book the characters were great and the sex when they did get it on was hot... The story for me was engrosing. Must have been I read it in a couple of days inbetween everything else I do day to day... <br />	2005-02-18

I have every one of Christine Stories I personally disagree however, her short stories are not up to her usual standard.  One of my favourites is her Contempory Gothic in A VERY GOTHIC CHRISTMAS and her DARK DREAM in AFTER TWILIGHT and her Shapeshifter story in FANTASY these get forgotton but not by me..  As with The SCARLETTI CURSE she features a tortured hero.. as with a lot of Gothics there is a supernatural elliment the Heroine is strong and refuses to be scared off by odds going on.... Creepy and full of dark forboding this is a SUPERB novel.. and one must not keep comparing with Christine's DARK SERIES.. Totaly different but still with Christine's ability to draw one in to the story.. as you actually living it.... an excellent read and one that will keep you up well into the night.. one must also remember from whether you read Daphne Du Murier or Christine they alway features creepy houses weird goings on..and weird people.....whether its Historical or Contempory GOTHIC NOVELS ALWAY HAVE A SIMILAR THEME....	2002-10-21

I give this and the previous novel A Kiss of Shadows..5 ***** firstly I would add unlike some of the reviewers I actually enjoyed both books more than the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series.. Firstly I found both books funny and I loved all the characters.. I says its every womans fantasy to have a guard of men.. who you can take to bed with you every night.. I found it refreshing change to one woman one man senario.. so Merry and her Raven Guards and her various contacts..all have interesting personality trates..<BR>Its also gruesome in places.. If you want something totally different and total fantasy.. here is the books for you but you really need to read A Kiss of Shadows first.. I for one can not wait for the next installment.. I shall say no as I do not want to give away the story... But this series is one I shall continue purchasing and on my keeper shelf to re-read at a later date....	2002-05-25

However, what I did find strange was that the excerpt at the back of Kiss and Tell... was totally different story to this book... This is not a problem... since I see that not only will the Wright Brothers get their story.. and intriguing they will be but also St.John the friend of Jake Dolan who is mentioned right at the very end.. and in particular the oddities of the Wright Brothers.. I also would like to know.. this about the brothers.. or certainly Kyle in this instance.. since Michael is also mentioned... How is it that Kyle has been a member of Jake Dolans organisationf or 10 years..Was he already a Member.. ( they also seem very secret or did he join.. re the mention in Kiss and Tell if so has ten years past since the first book.. well never mind that..<BR>As in the first this is an action packed book right up my tree the sex scenes raunchy in keeping with the strong males in these books and the women are not afraid to like it rough... I do so hate wimpy females.. and love strong charactors.. the dialogue is funny in places.. and I know that some readers found the plot<BR>unbelievable.. does it really matter. I mean they are all sort of James Bonds sort.. anyway.  Cherry is on my keeper shelf and if you like Linda Howard and Karen Robards then you'll love these<BR>Books..

Dracula is given birth to and not just arrived.... he is the product of rape of a gypsey and Lucifer.. He spends must of his youth in torment and ridicule. Vashti his childhood friend she sticks up for him often. Then both their worlds fall apart.. Vlads disappears and Vashti's father and uncle are killed Vashti believe Vlad is the murderer.. However, Vlads suffered at the cruel and depraved hads of Jamel a Turk with evil intentions.  He finally gets away from his clutches having spent 14 years of torture.. at the hands of Jamel and henchmen.  Vlad once again meets Vashti.. only to find that she is bent on revenge for the murder of her relatives.. Vlad spent most of his life in torment trying to keep away Lucifers influance.... But they still share the bond that was there in their childhood.. This story give birth to a legend and not only from the tale of Dracula but also briefly I believe on the on the story of Vlad the Impala.. that is if Vlad gives in.. to his evil side.. when he lets his guard down.. This story is full of emotion and I spent one day reading this book unable to put it down.... I finally finished reading it at 4.30 am.. in the morning not want to finished reading until I had finished the whole book... Anyone... who love a good solid story full of emotion and depth.. will not be disapointed.. I certainly wasn't I can't wait for the Sequel... Prince Eternal: Sacred Blood...

MADE ME LAUGH..	...this is not quite like those earlier books.. however, for entertainment value I think this is excellent.. Alex and Sam continually snipe at each and the issue of who is control is constant.. I like Alex she is a strong woman and knows her own mind.. and does not let anyway tell her what to do.. Sam is typical male of his time.. and is intrigue by Alex.. since normally women chase after him and he is doing the chasing.. I liked this... there were side issues that were not dwelled on and quite frankly there was no need.... no adventure..and the sex scenes though hot.. are not some of the best I've read.. and considering that Alex is such a strong character I think she should have got the better of Sam at least once.. I have given this book 5 stars for pure entertainment value and the fact I loved the Characters and had many laughs....I read the whole book in a day..lighted hearted and funny (Not wishy washy though )Great Entertainment for me and made me feel good..	2001-08-12

So ok some of spelling and gramma are not so hot BUT SO WHAT.. I enjoyed the tale for what is was entertaining.. And why should all time travel be a Sci-Fi exact.. after all its fiction and really does it matter the Talia returns to her own time before her original trip in time... and see her self.. after all they did take away her memories of that time.  I found the dialogue quite amusing with the BEAM ME UP SCOTTIE.. and the wonder Esmerelda.. and the hunks ... I would like to see a story about Tristen..If you ignore the gramma stuff.. and enjoy the story.. its a fine book and I read it in one sitting.. I would certainly buy more of Edens books and Iuniverse.. is helping unknowns come to print. Thanks..	2001-08-09

The suspense part of the book was very good and some parts made me sick.. the Exploitation of young girls from other countries and what was intended for them.. prostitution rape violation..I laughed at the funny antics had tears in my eyes in some places and felt sick in other..

Its one of the best I had read in a long while. I am English and live in the UK the dialogue had me laughing so many times.  Unlike some vampire novels which can be morose this is not. There is romance - humour - a certain amount of seriousness and wonderful characters I adored the vampires in this book.. Jason - Tom and Christopher.. and Dixie.. well what can you say.. modern woman who is willing to change her beliefs.. Love scenes in this book are HOT!!! and erotic..I read this in one sitting because I was unable to put this book down.. I am sorry that it came to and end.. I would love it if Jason and Tom had their own romance stories.. Tom in particular need it I think. Buy this book you won't be disapointed.. Its a book that will satisfy both lovers of Contempory Suspense mix with the Vampire genre.. Superb and Well done.  I sincerely hope that Rosemary Laurey writes more book like this. There is some wonderful writers out there writing with this genre and she is one of the best.. and the story is very original. Please write more and they will be on my shelf.	2001-06-21

It took awhile for me to get into this book - mostly because of pre-conceived ideas.. but once I got over my hand-ups I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Total role reversal.. Men who are treated as objects possessions playthings.. Male virginity.. male taken on the job of caring for the children... Male pleasure givers ( ie prostitutes ).. and there whole life revolves around book about Almacks set in the regency period of England.. with update look.. Ie role reversal.  Woman are in charge strong in character and warriors.. Men on the other hand are to be protected and cherished. Or in some case used and abused.. Men who have strong personalities are frowned upon.. So you see it took me a while to come to terms with this book.. but the story is a wonderful story and very entertaining. Some might say this book is about feminisms I disagree.. it more about adaptation of a race.. would be interesting to know why on this planet they have such books and how the  communitity evolved.. I know its not reality only fiction.. Excellent read and a well worth purchasing.. Excellent.. Well done Dara..	2001-06-20

Thrilling Series	Well Nancy has done it again.. slightly different this time but features Frank Cobb from Midnight Redeemer.  I loved this book and of course the irritating Quinton Alexander ( vampire ). I adore how her books and have the whole collection.  Frank has been given another job to do.. Go to the wild jungles of Peru and protect  Sheba Reynard an Enthnologist. Both of them have their own agendas.  Story is exciting and I read this book in one sitting.. Nancy's books are among the best vampire stories written with a twist... her charactors come to life.. This is a must if your'e collecting the Midnight series if not - it can be read as an individual book.. Although a particulary nasty vampire is featured this is not a romance between a vampire and human but about two people who one is a believer Frank Cobb and one who is not Sheba.. But very entertaining and thank you Nancy for giving us Franks story. Can't wait for the next one.	2001-06-20

I noticed one of the reviewers found this matter disapointing but one needs to have read the first ever book in the Midnight series. MIDNIGHT KISS and then again in the 3rd book MIDNIGHT SURRENDER... if you have read both of these you would understand why Louis wishes and has always wished to become human.. And that for all the hundreds of years he has lived that he have never faultered from this..This time he teams up with beautiful woman who is into genetic science and blood composition but people are being murdered in a very vampire way.. and someone is out to frame Louis for the murders..

These books are better.  I love the 3 entwined stories.. I also hope the Tom finally gets his wish and marries the woman he loves.  Her stories are believable.. also I love the fact that the woman in her books are not frightened off by the fact that their men are in a dangerous field.. and could loose their lives. Often books about men with dangerous jobs the woman have issues about what they do.. and they often have to give up their proffession to get the girl.  GREAT..
