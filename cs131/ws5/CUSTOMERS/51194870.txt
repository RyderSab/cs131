I still feel very empowered with the knowledge he has given me on this subject. It felt like he pulled me up from a deep dark well.  I think you will be able to relate to all the  examples that he gives. I have read many books concerning the same subject matter, but Dr. Simons' experience, multi dimentional, panoramic, and thoughtful understanding with people victimized by aggressive controllers shines through.  Small book, small price, huge deal in my opinion.  Excellent replacement for thousands of dollars and many hours of therapy, if someone or many folks in your life are driving you crazy.	2004-07-29

Golombs book being the daughter of a narcissist mother and father.  I have read almost every writing and book on Narcissism that amazon and the web have to offer and I was never bored of Golombs insights which were many.  I would put this book in my top 2.   There were good examples and short stories of concepts and traits typical of children of N's.  I related to her  experiences whether it was  traveling through Asia, or her  frightening stay in a hospital against her will.  This was the book my therapist recommended.  It was real, to the point, and gives constructive helpful information in the last chapter to help those children of N's overcome their destructive parenting.  I especially liked chapter 10 &quot;The child of a narcissist becomes a narcissist&quot; &quot;Alan&quot;.   There were many examples of children of Narcissists with varying personalities and lifestyles.  Unfortunately there is no validation from the author  if you have chosen to leave your relationship from a destructive abusive parent.  If you are looking for this you won't find it in her book.	2004-03-05

If it weren't for the reviewers I would have missed it.  How does one navigate through the zillions of &quot;self help&quot; books out there to find the real gems?  The reviewers  pushed me to the purchasing point.(thank you!)  The author Jean Jensen shows us real life examples of the stumbling blocks children of abusive parents have as adults, in the workplace and in their love lives.  At the end of the book are wonderful examples of people like you and me who explain how they moved through their own personal life struggles with the help of regression therapy.  Jean Jenson thoroughly explains her method in a considerate manner and gives a variety of  covert and overt abusive acts so you will relate, as opposed to deny.  You may have to read this a few times because the source of our problems wants us to react in an opposite direction to healing.  Jenson helped me see a way out and up, and she certainly covered all the bases to healing, covering many of my questions I could not find answers to with conventional therapy.	2003-11-01

Once therapy helps you to realize the abuse then this wonderful book  can take over the nuts and bolts of your recovery.  Engel explains everything very clearly into the what- when- wheres- and why's of emotional abuse and its effects on you.  Most importantly she explains the pitfalls of the emotionally abused woman and how she sets up her life (subconciously) for repeated abuse.  Engels doesn't leave out the ways  to help yourself recover.  I plan to read this book again and in my opinion this book qualifies as the bible for adult women  who have been emotionally abused as children.  Thank you past reviewers!!!  And yes I can really see how this book would be fabulous for  group therapy.  It is very easy to read.	2003-06-24

I loved the 30 meal plans in 45,60,80,and 100 grams of carbs.  Everything is spelled out for you, and I also liked the large size (it stays open on my kitchen counter) and how easy it is to read.  The first week on this diet I found myself in the supermarket reading all the ingredients and carbs on everything.(I agree - NO trans fats!! this country needs to outlaw them!)    I tried the Baihian  Halibut recipe as well as the Pecan Waffles and both were delicious.    In the first 10 days I lost about 2 pounds. I'm only 6 lbs overweight.  I am never hungry because I prepared by shopping and always have low carb  food on hand. (nuts, salad, tuna, salmon, chicken, Splenda, fresh vegies, low carb fruit, eggs, meat). I honestly think I ate a large amount of food.  I found a wonderful desert product in my supermarket called &quot;BIRDS Imported English Desert Mix&quot; which only has 7grams of carbs in it per serving because you add your own sugar, (Splenda in my case)and milk, and  takes just 4 minutes to prepare.  You wont feel deprived if you have low carb deserts on hand (ladies)especially if you are PMS &quot;ing&quot;, but there are plenty of desert recipes available in the book. Another great feature are eight pages of food categories (nuts, fruits, veggies etc) in three columns &quot;eat regularly&quot; &quot;eat in moderation&quot; &quot;eat sparingly&quot;.  This gives me a quick reference when I'm not sure of a food.   A diet high sugar and carbs throws  you on an insulin roller coaster.    In my ever so humble opinion I feel that mentally I have more clarity (like I'm not in a fog).  The book does not mention this but perhaps this is the &quot;energy&quot; the success stories refer to.  A healthy lifestyle and large weight loss is about 2 things Taking yourself out of denial about #1. How much you really exercise and #2. Knowing how much and WHAT you are putting in your mouth.  I personally don't plan to go back to the old way I was eating (a diet high in carbs).	2003-06-15

As I was reading it -  I was saying &quot;thank you&quot;  The information in Engels book filled all the holes I felt were not addressed in therapy.  So to all the people that spent the time reviewing this important book for the emotionally abused I would like to express my appreciation to you, otherwise I would have overlooked this gem, and perhaps would have missed the peace in my heart that I now have.	2003-06-15

Her book on verbal abuse was so excellent.  I think I have read ALL of her books.  What makes this book great is that she gives numerous examples of different couples and their in-law problems so there is a very good probability you will find your specific problem in the book.  The strategies given are ones you may not have even considered in your frustration of dealing with your obnoxious self centered in law(s).  I was very angry before I read this, now I'm just mildly amused.  I won't be  controlled with my own resentments/emotions any more. Susan will help you understand their ... little world of either not being able to \\"share\\" the love, or whatever unresolved  mess is in their minds, so you wont/dont take it personally.	2003-05-11

Men behave badly and the woman apoligises for it--just to shut him up.  I found this one in my local library.  She clearly explains why these women haters think like they do and what to do if you are in a relationship with one.  The  couples she writes about from the onset of their relationship to the end make the reading  interesting and  sometimes realistically painful.	2003-05-11

Verbal abuse can be very very subtle form of brainwashing, as well as the loud shouts of demoralizing words.  The book speaks loudly of the unspoken, of what society doesn't want you to deal with.  The information given is just what men don't want you to know as long as they can use these methods to control you. The book gives many examples of how women extacated themselves from verbal abuse with divorce.  Sometimes this is the right thing and sometimes it is wrong.  You dont have to demolish your  marriage (yes even in a verbally abusive relationship)to prove that you can now be the tyrant, but once you have the knowledge you can use it to your own benefit and make a change.  Change yourself by not absorbing the abusers words, and others will go with the program or they wont.  In other words, as a woman, empower yourself with this knowledge to overcome evil and make your life better.  Yes- you are being used! hate it and change.	2003-05-04

This is certainly an interesting book which tries to sell a single point, but too focused.  (I'm an upper middle class married woman with kids in case your wondering) The theme  is basically this \\"Now you are a wife, you feel like crap, and it is YOUR fault because you are subservient to \\"the witness\\".  Things just aren't that simple I'm afraid.  (not once were other cultures, ego,hollywood movies, competition, or capitalism mentioned or delved into) The author is a magazine editor/writer who thinks she has the answer to reduce the divorce rate in America!  I ask...does a magazine editor have the credentials and educational background of a sociologist, psychologist, anthropologist?  Would you read a book about saving your marriage if the author were a proctologist?  I feel deep down D.H. is insulting the intellegence of the women she is trying to help.  In a nutshell her theory for a better marriage is- shift your focus on cooking and cleaning and numerous other chores that need to be done-have some great sex, and find pleasure.(HMMM... find a pleasurable activity, what a concept!)) There are some good idea's in this book which are quotes from other known psychology types who have probably written good books. I feel the problem women face in America is the undermining of women by WOMEN, which is never addressed in any womans magazine, as well as their inability to read non fiction books and share what they know with other women.  This undermining  leaves woman in an archaeic institution all alone, adding fuel to an already burning disaster. There is a wonderful bibliography on pages 201-205.	2003-01-20

Then I found this book on amazon (it wasn't what my therapist recommended though).  I needed a book that was not autobiographical, I needed to hear many stories of others lives with covert and overt male and female narcissistic abuse, in order to unlock myself from my disbelief.  Finished it last night, still crying this morning, but I know things are going to be uphill for me from here.   This book was written by therapists for therapists but I got so much out of it, I would recommend this highly for any adults recovering from \\"N\\" abuse who have had at least some therapy.  As a victim I found that some of the techniques and methods described for recovery very helpful.  (The Lavender Saphire is one of them)  There are so many very specific things included in the Pressmans book that really touched home for me, opening doors and fitting puzzles together that had been unsoved for a lifetime. My book is filled with my highlights and dogears,well worth many times its listed price.	2002-12-12

He picked it up because we were having so much trouble with our oldest teenage daughter.  He read it first and highly recommended I read it.  Twenty or so pages through I realized  our daughter was a clone of \\"Morgan\\".  The diagnosis from the psychiatrist was identical. (Even the name of the psychiatrist was identical).  Deans' (the drug rehab counselor)assesment that \\"she feels safe to act out because you have such a secure home\\" was told to us by the \\"first\\" psycholgist to see our daughter.  Our home is not a  broken one either.  No second or third marriages here.  It was so nice to feel \\"not so alone\\" reading about Ms. Laras ordeal.  If you have another child like I do who \\"follows the rules\\" behaves and listens, its hard to reconcile that your a lousy parent.  After reading her book I believe it was the luck of the draw when it comes to children, and they could be wired very differently.  Even if I couldn't identify with Adairs \\"Morgan\\" it was still an excellent read, beautifully written.  There were diamonds scattered on EVERY page.  I was transformed while reading about Adairs life with her on and off father, so much like my own, a difficult high I.Q (er).  <BR>  I have and will continue to recommend this book to other parents of \\"difficult\\" children.

My 2002 new years resolution is to free myself of one third of the &quot;stuff&quot; in my home.  I am truly thankful I have found Ms Schechters book.  She explains why we collect, from a sociological viewpoint.  She also admits that this book is NOT for packrats (which I think is very big of her) unless of course they are really willing to change and their hoarding habits are causing real pain to them.  <BR>I didn't realize this was an obsessive compulsive disorder and may really require professional intervention. <BR> I love all the helpful hints like...&quot;Use large waste containers that stand up&quot; instead of itty bitty ones or just a floppy large plastic bag. There is real joy in tossing &quot;lotsa&quot; dust collectors away in a sturdy container. All of these gems (and there are many) of info really do add up to a happy successful clutter purging. I also like the fact that she does not go into things like &quot;how to organize your closet&quot; etc.  You come to realize that your precious time will be free of &quot;organizing&quot; when you are free of all the overabundance in your life. Since I do clean my own home &quot;decluttering&quot; makes this job much easier.  Any surface that has no knicknacks takes just seconds to clean and dust. If Harriets book doesn't motivate you to happily want to &quot;declutter&quot; I dont think that another book out there would.  I have read many others, and I feel this one is the best.	2002-02-13

An astonishing  study of a real life &quot;wolf&quot; a monster.  I'm a little embarassed that I'm closely  related to a well known criminologist (sociologist) who doesnt believe in  the death penlty (and has written many books on the subject).  This book  will convince you that serial killers should fry and I believe that I could  have personally pulled the switch Ted Bundy after reading this story.  I  read this book nearly 18 years ago and although I forget lots of books I've  read, but there hasn't been a time when I washed my car that I havent  thought back to this book (you'll find out why when You read it).  It will  haunt you forever..I highly recommend it to all and I will have my own  children read it someday so they will understand that one can never be too  careful.  I came away from this story feeling a very deep sorrow for the  victims and their families.  The author  will take you to a dark world that  few ever experience, and will forever change the way you think,  the author  (through painstaking interviews) succeeds in writing a book about the Devil  himself that will not soon be forgotten.	2000-05-17

I have never hated reading a book as much as THIS book.  It was given to me by a friend who absolutely couldn't say enough GREAT things about it.  I have read 2/3rds of this book and wasted way too much of my life on it.   Tonight this book will join the logs in the fireplace.  I can't believe  women can be this petty.	1999-09-27
