For quite a while there, it seemed was an apparent brick wall of unity in favor of the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq among conservatives in America.  It just wasn't conceivable that there were actually serious dissenting voices about the war on the right. <br /> <br />This was not a truly accurate picture as Gary Rosen so ably demonstrates in this collection of essays.  This collection provides a wide diversity of conservative opinion regarding both the decision to go to war as well as the conduct of the war.   <br /> <br />What becomes clear in very short order is that there were in fact serious people on the conservative side who had a wide array of objections to these wars, particularly the War in Iraq. <br /> <br />This book is bound to get a much more pervasive look now that time has passed and the monolithic support for the war amongst the general public has faded.  One suspects that many of the authors of these pieces will, over time, begin to get much more exposure in the main stream media as the war drags on and more and more people begin to understand the validity and prescience of these pieces.  <br /> <br />There are problems with the book.  Rosen limits himself to pieces from a fairly circumscribed time period (2004 and 2005).  Some of these are what one can only regard as watered down given their authors-the piece by Buchanan is a good example. <br /> <br />The main lesson of the book is to illustrate that serious voices on the right that should have been heard were not-to the eventual detriment of the country.  Perhaps had some of these opinions been seriously considered earlier, we would have proceeded more carefully and successfully in iraq and Afghanistan. <br />	2005-09-28

The Running of the Bulls by Nicole Ridgeway is one of the most boring and insipid books I have read in a long time.   <br /> <br />The book follows a cabal of \\"elite\\" MBA students as they wend their way towards their 6 figure jobs. Written with a breezy fictional style that tries to generate some sense of both drama and suspense, the book fails at virtually every level.  <br /> <br />For one thing, there is no actual drama or suspense.  These kids are going to one of the top three business schools in America and, short of outright failure in the classroom, murder or being caught on film in the Dean of Academics significant others bed, there is no suspense whatsoever as to the ultimate conclusion-high level corporate jobs for every one of them. <br /> <br />This doesn't stop Miss Ridgeway from trying to generate suspense.  Will Jessica, the cute-as-pie former Texas cheerleader win the Dean's Award?  Is Grace really going to be happy flogging spreadsheets at A. T. Kearney?  How does John work up the courage to say `no' to Johnson & Johnson for a better offer? <br /> <br />It would be bad enough if this were the only problem with this book.  There is another, though this one can't be laid at Miss Ridgeway' feet.  The other problem is these may be the most unlikable people you read about this year.  They are so conformist as to be inane.  With the world at their feet all they can think about is perks.  There isn't an iota of idealism among this poor proportion of humanity.   With their smarts, access to power and punched ticket from Wharton all they can think about is the size of their potential bonuses, the kinds of cars that their prospective employers offer as company vehicles, the size of their offices. <br /> <br />The only thing of value in the book is the short history of the Wharton which is both interesting and informative. <br /> <br />In the end, one is left with not admiration for these people but the incredible desire to kick them in their behinds and yellat them to get real.  One wonders how Miss Ridgeway didn't. <br /> <br />A truly depressing and boring book. <br />	2005-08-27

Most biographies of Benjamin Franklin tend to focus on his role as statesman as opposed to his role as scientist.  Given the impact he had on the raod to independence and nationhood for the U.S. this is entirely understandable.  However, he was in his time revered as much for his impact on the world of science as he was for his role as a statesman.  In Stealing God's Thunder : Benjamin Franklin's Lightning Rod and the Invention of America Philip Dray attempts to reverse this bias and portray Franklin's life with  the focus on his role as a scientist in the forefront. <br /> <br />What is most interesting in this approach is how much one sees that there is nothing new under the sun when it comes to the human condition.  The emotional debates over evolution, genetic engineering, cloning and so on have their predecessors in the advancements of previous times.  Dray focuses on Franklin's invention of the lightening rod, what today seems the most benign of devices, but which stirred many deep emotions and much religious opposition in its time. <br /> <br />By inventing the lightening rod there were those-and they were many-who accused Franklin of \\"playing God\\".  (Does that sound familiar?)  They believed that Franklin, by directing lightening into the ground was adversely affecting divine balances between the heavens and the earth.  He was roundly condemned in  his time for doing so by many very prominent clergy, including the pastor of Boston's influential South Church, Thomas Prince. <br /> <br />The attacks had their effects.  Franklins image was tarnished among many fundamentalist Christians and the use of the lightening rod declined considerably after these attacks.  Yet it overcame these attacks.  In what can only be described as a perverse turn, the efficacy of the lightening rod was demonstrated in Europe.  The invention of large scale field artillery required that huge quantities of gun powder be stored.  Often, it was stored in the vaults of churches.  When lightening struck, the results could be devastating.  The end result was European governments adopted widespread use of the lightening rod to save churches utilized to protect the means of war. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book that not only provides a unique perspective on Franklins life and legacy but also, in the process, puts the public debates of our own age in a very interesting light as well. <br />	2005-08-20

Patty Jane's House of Curl is one of those books that makes you want to scream.  On the one hand, Lorna Landvik can write.  She utilizes a whimsical yet affecting writing voice that captures ones attention and keeps the reader fully engaged. And, for the most part, the general scope of the story is engaging as well.  However, once one gets into it the book starts to take on a highly contrived aspect that is severely annoying.   <br /> <br />The story revolves around the lives of two Minnesota sisters from around the mid 1950's through the mid 1980's.  The characters all well drawn and, on the whole, fairly interesting.  What is contrived is the circumstances of their lives.  There are a few too many, too outlandish plot twists, some of which stretch one's sense of credulity.  These plot machinations deflect significantly from the story.  However, Landvik's writing is so good one keeps on going despite the annoyance. <br /> <br />Thee end result is that, while one in the end feels greatly for many of the characters, one also is left with the sense that one has been party to a hoax.  Not a very satisfying conclusion to a novel that could have been so much more fulfilling had Landvik exerted a bit of restraint. <br />	2005-08-16

Incendiary is as multifaceted, complex and enthralling a novel as I have read in a long time.   <br /> <br />Ostensibly this book is about terrorism as represented by a massive suicide bombing at a soccer match in London.  In actuality it is about the corrosive aftereffects terrorist acts have on both society and individuals both from the standpoint of dealing with the immediate trauma as well as the more subtle yet equally difficult task of reevaluating ones values and principles to confront an extraordinary yet essentially invisible evil in your own back yard. <br /> <br />The book examines these issues through an artifice-the novel is one long letter from a widow created by the soccer stadium blast to Osama bin laden.  I have seen authors use this device before, with a tremendous lack of success, but Chris Cleave pulls it off with aplomb.  His unnamed protagonist effectively reflects in her missive the complex dynamics of both her own and society's evolving reactions and responses to the terrorist act.   <br /> <br />The book raises many deeply relevant questions.  How much of what our narrator feels and acts is a reflection of the act itself or the personal betrayal she was engage din as the act took place?  How much of one's values and principles does society wish to abandon to combat the terrorists?   <br /> <br />The book also gently ties into the narrative the essentially timeless aspects of these questions.  Just as Churchill was faced with the question of what to do about the knowledge he possessed of Nazi intentions (gained through breaking Nazi communications codes), i.e., do we warn people in his target areas and save lives but lose the intelligence pipeline or do we sacrifice those lives to preserve that pipeline? (he chose the latter) the London Police face similar quandaries.  The tactics may be new-the war is ancient and ongoing. <br /> <br />The book has some of the flaws one would expect with a debut novel.  Some characters appear only to disappear for no apparent reason.  Some of the mechanics of the book are stilted and jarring.  Not all of the characters are fully fleshed out.  Normally these flaws would lead me to lower this to a 4 star rating.  However, the highly skilled execution of the letter artifice along with the deeply textured and multifaceted psychological and sociological ruminations of the book, combined with its gripping prose style, overwhelm and minor flaws. <br /> <br />This is an awesome book that everyone in today's world need s to read. <br />	2005-08-06

Jasper Fforde has an incredibly inventive mind and a rare insight into literary machinations.  Both of those qualities are in full display in his latest work, The Big Over Easy.   <br /> <br />This book is billed as a \\"Nursery Crime\\" and that's an apt description.  The premise of the story revolves around an investigation into the death of Humpy Dumpty, found rather scrambled at the foot of a wall.  Jack Sprat and his partner, Mary,Mary are assigned to the case.  Shaped as a straightforward police procedural, the book evolves as not quite a fairy tale and not quite as straightforward a detective novel as was probably intended. <br /> <br />That the work is clever is an understatement.  Fforde manages to pack an unbelievable number of puns and \\"inside\\" literary allusions into this work.  Therein lies at once both the strength and the weakness of the book.  These amusements are often genuinely funny, but all too often either so contrived or so obscure as to dampen the fun associated with the really good ones.  Moreover, the prose can get to be a bit redundant (after a while the Mary,Mary thing starts to wear) and that can make long passages of the book somewhat difficult slogging. <br /> <br />All in all one has to extend kudos to Fforde for the incredible originality and incredibly nimble execution of the concept underlying this book, but one still wishes that he had exercised a bit of restraint in the actual writing and gimmickry he over employed all to often in the writing of this otherwise most amusing effort. <br />	2005-07-30

This is essentially a crime novel set in the west, not a western as most people understand that term.   As I read the book I was struck that is is conceived and written more as a Tony Hillerman novel on meth than anything McCarthy has written to date. <br /> <br />Which isn't to denigrate the book.  It's very, very good, though extremely violent and nihilistic. The story revolves around a fellow named Llewelyn Moss who comes across the debris of a drug deal gone bad.  Amongst the blood and gore is a bag with $2 million in it which Lewellen takes along with him.  A fellow named Chigurg (pronounced sugar), an alleged bounty hunter but a hit man with pretensions of respectability is dispatched to reacquire the funds and brutalize the bags temporary holder. <br /> <br />The action is swift, suspenseful and violent.   <br /> <br />This is a lean, small novel of spare prose of immense intensity that reflects a bleak and nihilistic vision of mankind.  The action occasionally seems a bit contrived (as if, say, someone like Quentin Tarantino were looking over the authors shoulder molding the action to fit the film version) but overall this is an excellent little read that hits fast, hits hard and is gone in what seems like little more than 60 seconds.  <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed it but those looking for more of the same from McCarthy may be both shocked and disappointed with this effort. <br />	2005-07-24

Betty Crocker may hold the distinction of being the first \\"virtual\\" corporate employee in American history.  She has been seen and heard by millions on radio and TV.  She has corresponded with uncounted thousands of America's 20th centaury housewives.  In 1945, she was voted in a survey as the second most admired woman in the US after Eleanor Roosevelt.  All pretty heady stuff for someone who doesn't actually exist. <br /> <br />Betty Crocker was the invention of a corporate marketing effort.  This is the story of how and why she was created and how, once created, she became one of the most successful marketing campaigns in American corporate history. <br /> <br />One wouldn't think on the face of it that this story would make much of a book.  One would be wrong.  This is a fascinating story that chronicles not only the Betty Crocker story but also the development of corporate marketing in the US in the 1900's in general.   The book also, along the way, provides a lot of insight into the mechanics of a modern food processing conglomerate as well as the ways in which American's were convinced to include a lot of processed foods into their diet by these conglomerates. <br /> <br />It is an interesting, entertaining and somewhat nostalgic story.  The times and issues that were the crucible for the creation of Betty are unimaginably bucolic in nature by today's standards.  This is not only a book about Betty, but about our parents and grandparents as well. <br /> <br />There are some shortcomings-the author tends to skip over things and becomes a bit too folksy at times, but these are quibbles-this, against all my expectations, proved to be a very enjoyable read.  Highly recommended to one and all. <br />	2005-03-28

John Adams is going through a bit of a revival these days-a development about which he no doubt would be both pleased and puzzled. This is the third Adams biography I have read in the past year, also taking in the recent books by John Diggins and David McCullough.<br /><br />All three books give Adams his due-something largely denied him in his own time.  They capture the iconoclastic nature of his personality as well as his intellectual power and accomplishments.  Diggins focuses on Adam's Presidency, so his narrative is somewhat restricted, and , in fact, his style is as well.  McCullough on the other hand is his devilishly detailed self, sometimes to the extent of burdening the reader with more than he cares-or needs-to really know about things incredibly trivial and marginal to the story at hand.<br /><br />For my money, this biography by Grant is the best produced so far.  I believe it does the best job of truly capturing the essence of Adams-his powers, his struggles, his insecurities, as well as capturing the total picture of both his personal and professional lives.<br /><br />At 530 pages, the book is expansive enough for the true historical aficionado without becoming tedious to the more casual historical reader.  Moreover, grant is more oft able to put forward a fresher, more energetic view than is the more plodding and cumbersome McCullough.<br /><br />In the end, once one has finished the book, it's truly hard not to admire Adams for his accomplishments and his truly unique story.  At the same time, it's also hard not to admire Mr. grant for finally putting out such a spectacular biography for a man who truly deserved one.<br /><br />An excellent book through and through.	2005-03-26

It fails completely on both scores. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that Mr. Wertheim either has no knowledge of the unfortunate aspects of racial segregation and discrimination in Indiana over the second half of the Twentieth Century or doesn't care to acknowledge the realities of that history.  It really doesn't matter which it is:  in any case, his failure to accurately reflect the forces that shape the social aspects of Indiana basketball forms the foundation for the failure of this book.  As the book moves along, it quickly becomes clear that Mr. Wertheim also has no real understanding of either the sources of motivation for the black athlete nor the black athlete's attitude towards any aspect of either basketball or life in general.   <br /> <br />It's also clear that Mr. Wertheim also doesn't understand the nuances of the differences in the way that basketball is played in Indiana.  Within the more rural, Anglo communities basketball is a horizontal, team oriented game.  Among the urban African American community it is a vertical, individually improvisational game.  At the college level and among the pro's, this letter aspect forms the core of the philosophy of basketball as a game.  This fact goes a long way in explaining why so many heralded Indiana basketballers-mostly rural white kids-fail at the higher levels.  They don't play the same game and the way the game is played requires more moxie and more athleticism than they typically have.  In general, the more gifted black players go elsewhere to play.  That's what happened with Oscar Robertson and it has been the norm ever since. <br /> <br />The book does contain some interesting in depth profiles of players and programs and it's clear that Mr. Wertheim has a genuine love for the game-the way it was played 30 years ago and is still played in some of the more remote Indiana rural areas.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a truly disappointing and unusually clueless book. <br />	2005-03-17

In Crichton's view, the whole global warming argument is false.  His view is that environmentalism has degenerated into a quasi religious system devoid of scientific veracity.  Thus, the proponents of the global warming hysteria are pushing faith over fact, many of them have lost their moorings and the inevitable result is a grand conspiracy. <br /> <br />At the heart of this conspiracy is Nick Drake, head of a radical environmentalist group.  Outraged that a significant source of funding has been closed by the donors getting Drakes science debunked by a MIT professor, drakes sets out on a murderous course that is designed to both do away with his detractors and enemies while concomitantly creating a profound state of fear about global warming among the public. <br /> <br />As is generally the case with Crichton, an avalanche of scientific data is imparted in Crichton's usual informative yet entertaining manner.  Many will debate the validity of Crichton's \\"science\\" as regards the issue of global warming.  As Crichton so deftly displays in this novel, this issue has become more political than scientific in many ways and there's no reason this novel won't be analyzed in that light. <br /> <br />The story has all the traditional strengths and weaknesses of a Crichton novel.  Crichton is an accomplished technician and that comes through in this novel.  It can justifiably be called a page turner.  However, the methodology of using characters to do the education creates a scenario wherein the characters become somewhat robotic and predictable, not truly fully fleshed out human beings. <br /> <br />However, that's quibbling.   This is a very fine novel.  I suspect one's enjoyment will be colored to a great degree with how strongly one leans to or away from Crichton's premise.  That aside, this ranks as one of his better works. <br />	2004-12-10

Mr. Thomson is well placed to write such a book-his other \\"credits\\" include a biography of an  18th century novelist as well as one of Orson Welles, an history of an artic exploration and the all inclusive \\"The New Biographical Dictionary of Film\\".    The whole equation is an extremely well written and absorbing account of the film industry including, on one side of the equation, the artistic elements of writing, acting and directing, and on the other side of the equation, the bottom line businessmen-the studio chiefs, the producers, agents and assorted bean counters.    Mr. Thomson does not shine his spotlight only on the success stories.  He chronicles the rise and fall of several key talents-some well now, some obscure-through all the various means of descent-failure of inspiration, life-styles of enormous excess, bad career management, overrun ego and the nefarious tyrannies of studio chiefs.  He also traces the many arcs of success and the juxtaposition of the two often illustrates how often luck---both good and bad-affects trajectories in Hollywood.    This book has a bit of something for everyone.  Although written with a novelistic flair, the book adheres to an historian's discipline.  It has the \\"names\\" one would expect and interesting biographical datum on many great Hollywood personalities.  It does a very nice job of providing a vivid picture of how the film industry operates.  The book is both informative and fun to read.    A great book for film junkies.	2004-12-08

Dostoyevsky once observed that \\"beauty is the battlefield where God and the devil war for the soul of man\\".  In History of Beauty Umberto Eco provides an historical context to how that battlefield has changed over the past 3000 years or so. <br /> <br />This is a sumptuous, unusually high quality coffee table book.  While its over 400 photographs are extremely engaging, the introductions and essays Eco provides are absorbing and just as illuminating as the pictures.  Eco lists himself as editor, but that is false modesty.  His writing here is excellent, erudite and informative and provides a lot of food for thought as one peruses the visuals. <br /> <br />As is to be expected from Eco, his essays cite philosopher that run the gamut from Aristotle and Plato through to Xenophon (though I did not see any Dostoyevsky references though that dark soul was seemingly compulsive about the mesmerizing qualities of beauty) and thusly provide an all encompassing review of differing concepts of what is beautiful by both geographically and chronologically. <br /> <br />This is a rich, beautiful book that will please the dedicated reader as well as the casual surfer who might flip through it. <br /> <br />If you want to upgrade the ambiance of your coffee table, this would be an excellent choice. <br />	2004-12-01

In Armageddon Mark Hastings has provided an in depth and wide ranging history of the last months of World War II in Europe.  This massive tome provides an organized and intimate window into the appalling toll of war, a toll exacerbated by errors overconfidence contributed particularly among the Western allies on the one hand and the incalculable atrocities the vengeance of the Russians contributed on the other. <br /> <br />Hastings effectively shows how overconfidence born from the success of the western invasion on D-day led the western allies into a series of questionable decisions of both tactical and psychological nature.  The failure to secure the deep water port at Antwerp and the miscalculation as to the  willingness and capabilities of the retreating Germans to continue to battle led to unnecessary disaster at Arnheim and the Ardennes.   <br /> <br />Hastings also provides what may be the first authoritative overview of the raping and pillaging of Prussia by Russian troops, a saga of atrocities unparallel in 20th century history and possibly the most savage actions in Europe sine the days of the Mongol invasions. <br /> <br />Although great in scope the book has curious omissions.  There is virtually nothing here relating to the war in southern Europe.  Although some major characters get the full historical overview, others are given relatively short shrift.  And there is a definite element of personal commentary as to certain players (Monty in particular) that are less than objective in my view. <br /> <br />However, on the whole this is an awesome historical review of a major historical event with lessons for today.  The perils of the end game in Europe may well have implications as to the possible end game in Iraq.  If so, the lessons are not heartening. <br /> <br />So, in the end, this book has value not only as a historical reference but as a warning about the perils that sill face those who wage war today. <br />	2004-11-18

This slacker genre has always baffled me--what is the attraction of self centered, overeducated lazy louts in our society?  I've tried reading several of these sorts of novels and have no idea what the attraction is supposed to be.   <br /> <br />At least chick lit--the other current trendy genre of the moment--usually provides some sort of plotting to wrap your attention around.  That isn't the case with the slacker genre--and that's not the case here, although as a series of \\"essays\\" this book has at least an excuse for it's rambling. <br /> <br />Hyman is a pretty good writer.  The problem is he hasn't much to say, so he tries to compensate with what amounts to a non-stop stand-up comedy, stream of consciousness style of writing that has it's moments but quickly wears thin. <br /> <br />All in all, one of the better slacker books I've read, but that's pretty much damning with faint praise with this genre.

However, this book is far less about AIDS than it is about the human condition in general and, more specifically, the transformative powers of both fear and love. <br /> <br />I had previously read Dr. Verghese's The Tennis Partner, an excellent book that shares some critical threads with this effort.  In both books Verghese, an Indian from India, effectively portrays both the problems as benefits associated with being a foreign doctor in America--the former being the prejudices that accrue to those who had the perceived misfortune to be born in the third world and the freedom that being an \\"outsider\\" brought to the patient-doctor relationship. <br /> <br />The Tennis partner was a fictional work with obvious significant autobiographical undertones.  This book is clearly an autobiographical work of nonfiction that benefits considerably from Verghese's previous work within a fictional realm.  Verghese writes very well and he uses his quite considerable talents to render a moving, suspenseful and insightful book. <br /> <br />These being a medical autobiography, a fair amount of fairly detailed, turgid technical aspects are a part of the package.  That is the only genuine criticism I can make.  Other than that, the book is a fascinating, engaging, highly moving account of human misery, death and, ultimately, triumph. <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I've read this year.

What should be a source of great personal satisfaction and a springboard to self actualization is instead a source of perpetual angst and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br />Alice Black is a lady of very modest means whose life has been a long exercise in personal unhappiness, attained largely through a series of disastrous liaisons with married men who treat her like dirt.  She is slowly but surely becoming a mildly deranged recluse in her aunts old, rambling home.  Pete Ross is a former chef of note who one day turned on his family in a burst of violent rage and destroyed not only his marriage but his sanity as well.  Recently released into the custody of his mother-a nun-he is trying to reengage with reality and society. <br /> <br />As the book opens these three circle one another like moths at a porch light--flying around one another in close proximity without actual contact.  Slowly but sure their universe begins to contract to where they do make contact.  The book is, essentially a chronicle of how they come together and regain their bearings. <br /> <br />There is significant editorial commentary relating to other ways of engaging--particularly the paranormal--provided through the presence of Alice's aunt Kate.  Both Kate and Alice are relatives of William James, a leading authority of the paranormal of the early 20th century.  Aunt Kate's obsession with her ancestor provides a context for this aspect of the tale. <br /> <br />This is an unusual book.  There really is no plot of substance to speak of-this is a character novel.  To be kind, it's pacing would best be described as stately.  There is not a lot of action.  Yet the book is mesmerizing.  Almost from the start we are captivated by these broken people and care about them.  The book is compelling if not exactly a page turner. <br /> <br />I thought Round Rock was a bit better book-this is a much finer story.  You can't go wrong reading either. <br />	2004-11-01

I truly enjoyed his first novel, Bodega dreams.  This effort leaves that one in the dust.    Chango's Fire is a novel full of fully developed and vibrant characters that are transcended by the main character--the setting.  The book plays out in Spanish Harlem (Spa Ha to all us yuppies)and the tide of history in Spanish Harlem provides an undercurrent of tension, passion and authenticity to all the characters that populate this novel.    First among these is Julio Santana, a professional arsonist bent as the novel begins on quitting his profession.  That proves to be harder than expected as on his last job he breaks the cardinal rule of his business, thus pitting him against an array of forces inexorably pulling him back into his personal nightmare.  His life is further complicated by a new tenant in his building--a beautiful and intriguing Anglo woman who mesmerizes Julio, his childhood love/adversary, Maritza, whose socialist church is also located in his building, as well as his parents, with whom he lives.     The book blends the hippest current dynamics of contemporary Spanish Harlem with the often tumultuous and violent history of that place into the dynamics pulling and tugging at Julio's troubles.  It provides a window into the truly diverse dynamics of that neighborhood--religion, organized crime, gentrification, Hispanic family life and Latino passion.    Quinoez has an extremely powerful writing voice and a true sense of pacing.  The book is compelling and makes for a compulsive read.  This is not so much a book one reads as much as it is a book one lives in.    I can only hope there is much more of this sort of writing yet to come from Quinonez.  This book is brilliant.	2004-11-01

The Great Game: The Myth and Reality of Espionage by Frederick P. Hitz is, essentially, a comparative analysis.  Hitz, a longtime actual spook at the CIA compares and contrasts various actual spies (Aldrich Ames, Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, etc.) life and professional histories with the writings and characters of highly regarded and well known fictional stories and spies-( John Le Carre, Tom Clancy).<br />Overall, the book is a great disappointment.  While there is the occasional nugget of info that piques ones interest, on the whole the exercise generates conclusions that dash between the obvious to the trite.<br />That in itself would be disappointing enough.  The real problem here is that Hitz demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the nature of spy fiction.  None of the books he analyzes are written to be a primer of the spy profession.  These are not procedurals, they bare novels.  As such, they are written to be, more than anything else, morality plays.  The issues at hand may vary between the morality of grand policies of nations or movement, the morality of spying itself, the interplay between good and evil-whatever.  They are written to tell a story and express a viewpoint, not to provide ideal textbook descriptions of the art of spying.  That's the role of non-fiction.<br />Hitz marvels that the \\"real world\\" is so much more complex, untidy, clear cut and, indeed, in some ways, far more chaotic than is portrayed in spy novels.  He would have done well to remember Tom Clancy's famous quote about the difference between fiction and real life:  \\"Fiction has to make sense.\\"<br />His lack of understanding of that premise sinks this effort from the beginning.	2004-06-15

There's a slew of &quot;histories&quot; of George W's Iraq War hitting the shelves these days.  These books provide high insight as to the serious flaw of the &quot;instant&quot; history book.  John Keegan's The Iraq War showcases this point.<br />As an historical tome The Iraq War flits between brilliance and idiocy.  It is brilliant insofar as it deals with actual, prewar historical perspective.  Keegan-an able historian, one must admit-does a superlative job of providing the context in which Saddam rose, the means he used to hold and wield power, the circumstances and dynamics that drove the first Gulf War and the factors that lead to this more recent conflict.  It is idiotic in that it misses the point entirely as to the actual circumstances of the second war, however.  Keegan paints this second conflict as a paragon of military planning and efficiency.  He points out that less than 200,000 troops \\"defeated\\" a country the size of California with 30 million residents in less than three weeks.  His focus is limited virtually entirely to this 3 week period, with but a smattering of commentary on the year that followed this \\"victory\\".<br />This might have been a viable perspective 6 or 7 months ago when Mr. Keegan presumably started writing this book.  However, as time goes on, particularly with the capture of Saddam, new insights emerge.  It is now clear that Saddam had no intention of ever fighting a conventional war.   His strategy all along was to fight an urban guerrilla war in the major cities.  This did not occur initially as the blitzkrieg that Mr. Keegan so keenly praises overwhelmed the Iraqi fighters.  However they reacted by simply evaporating and restaging their war after the invading forces established themselves in the country.  One can make the argument-and events would support this-that the Iraq War did not in fact even begin till 90-100 days after the invasion.   We continue to fight that war up to this day.  This genuine guerrilla war has been farmore costly to the invaders-in terms of deaths, injuries, morale and their international standing as well as their standing with the Iraqi people-than could have been apparent when Keegan started writing this book.  Moreover, there is no end in sight. Clearly, it is far to early to write any \\"history\\" of this conflict.<br />Thus the serious flaw of this sort of endeavor thus becomes apparent.  Undertaken so close to the actual event, by the time it goes to print, events on the ground have overtaken and undermined the thesis of the exercise.<br />This is an excellent read from the point of view of the general historical aspects of Saddam's regime.  However, if one thing is clear, such judgments as Mr. Keegan is wont to make need much more time and perspective to pass before one should characterize them as \\"history\\".	2004-06-15

He's part of the Washington foreign policy establishment and a professor of International studies at Johns Hopkins University.  So, while he is an academic he's neither an anthropologist nor a social historian.  He is, obviously, an ardent sports fan.  Knowing these facts helps to understand both why this book works and why it fails.<br />The book works superbly as an historical analysis.  Even dedicated sports fans of the Big Three (football, baseball and basketball) will learn quite a bit about the development of their favorite sports as well as about the titans of the games that whose accomplishments fueled their growth.   He also provides some interesting and unique insights as to turning points in the history of each sport and how the vortex of those turning points was so similar.  For example, Ruth in baseball, Rockne in football and Hank Lusetti in basketball all provided an elevation point for their respective sports both by providing dramatic, interesting, charismatic personalities but also through feats that made the ball easy to see in dramatic fashion (Ruth with the towering home run, Rockne by popularizing the forward pass, Lusetti in inventing the jump shot).<br />The book is far less successful as a vehicle of social analysis.  Mandelbaum uses allusion a lot as a means for evoking the social meaning of sport.  I'm not aware that allusion is a key too of either social science in general or anthropology in particular.  A comparative analysis that juxtaposes baseball with agrarian values, football with industrial and martial values and basketball with spectacularly ill defined \\"post industrial\\" values may have some illustrative value but fails as an analytical tool.  This discussion is often interesting but it fails to address two basic issues, to wit (1) the meaning of sports in general and (2) the enigma that the most popular US sports are of little significance to the rest of humanity.<br />On the whole thisis a lively and informative book, and I very much enjoyed reading it.  However, it doesn't even come close to its stated goal of explaining the meaning of sports, and in the end that is a major disappointment.	2004-06-09

Between Two Rivers : A Novel is Nicholas Rinaldi's third novel.  I thought his previous novel, The Jukebox Queen of Malta, was one of the better books of the year in 2000.<br />Rinaldi has followed up that success with another blockbuster novel.  Set in a Battery Park condo, Between Two Rivers is an expertly woven quilt of a novel that brilliantly illuminates the subtle bonds that develop between people who, by chance or by choice, happen to live together.<br />The story revolves around one Farro Fescu, the inimitable Romanian concierge, who watches with keen eyes the comings and goings of the intriguing inhabitants of Echo Terrace, as the building is called.  The building's name itself conjures up the themes that permeate this book-memory and shared experience.  It is through this wonderfully energetic and nosy concierge that Mr. Rinaldi introduces the other residents, each with a wonderfully engaging and, often, enigmatic story to tell.<br />The condo's residents mirror the ethnic, intense and farcical nature of New York.  Although a novel in format, the construction of the book approached that of a collection of short stories in some respects as Rinaldi explores the inner workings and motivations of each character, but he always segues adroitly back into novel mode as he approaches the interrelationships and dynamics of the Echo Terrace's emotional and interrelational ecology.<br />This is a book with first rate characters, elegant writing, dynamic construction and, ultimately, a book that provides one with a tremendous sense of satisfaction.<br />Rinaldi just gets better and better.  We can only hope he has many mode books in him.	2004-06-08

The Wisdom of Crowds : Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business,Economies, Societies and Nations by James Surowiecki is, essentially, a thoroughly accessible and readable tome on applied behavioral economics and game theory.  <br />I know that doesn't sound too exciting, but this actually is a fascinating book that is something of a page turner if you have even the most vestigial interest in the topic.<br />The premise isn't new-those who are denizens of Wall Street and know Robert Prechter's oft cited work with Elliott Wave Theory will know something of the underlying premises of the book.  However, Surowiecki takes this notion and moves well beyond the confined world if inventing (though he covers that as well) to apply the principles he delineates to life in general-behavior in traffic, tracking and responding to disease, navigating the internet and so on.<br />The strength of the boom is Surowiecki's ability to render the underpinnings of his theoretical paradigm in easily understandable terms and examples.  Additionally, the book features an excellent opening that provides a wonderful foundation as regards applied behavioral economics and game theory in general.<br />On the other hand, Surowiecki tends to play both sides of the street.  He uses his \\"expert\\" position on the subject to configure his arguments and analysis to tilt the weight of evidence behind his theory in many cases.  In other words, his familiarity with where he wants this to go influences his choices of examples.  Moreover, he relies on too few  examples in too many cases.  For example, the world of wall Street should have provided a wealth of examples as to the validity-and the errors-inherent in his theory.  His choices seem to be crafted to provide maximum support while eliminating any element of contraindication whatsoever.<br />So, in the end, despite the fact that Surowiecki has written a wonderfully readable book, and posited some fascinating theoretical axioms, the book feels a bit to tilted to be thoroughly honest with the subject matter in an applied arena.  Surowiecki gives us much food for thought but also leaves us with reasons to doubt somewhat his objectivity and intellectual honesty.  That fact detracts frm the value of the book, and that's a shame.	2004-06-02

I think Mr. Greene is, to a certain extent, a victim here of his own success.  His previous book-The Elegant Universe-- was brilliant.  His expertise is super strings and multi-dimensional space and that was the focus of that book.  It was a surprise success in the mass market and I suspect he and his publishers were so enamored of that success that a follow-up was required as a matter of course.  Unfortunately, Greene had pretty much exhausted the superstring thing so a different concept was needed.  Thus, this more expansive, less focused tome was produced.<br />It's not so much that this book is bad-its not.  It's just that it suffers considerably when compared to The Elegant Universe.  Here Greene delves into areas he clearly is not as well versed in as string theory, areas that obviously don't hold the same fascination for him.  <br />This leads to problems.  The book is characterized by a significant unevenness. There are topics where Greene examines things thoroughly:  others receive short shrift.  Many of the allusions are clearly inferior in terms of presentation and thoughtfulness as compared to the Elegant Universe.<br />Having said all that, green does indeed have a knack for creating illustrative vignettes that relate many of the obscure and arcane concepts covered here in a way that is accessible and understandable.  Through his narrative he presents a good-though very basic-historical overview of the development of these ideas and those who drove these areas of inquiry.<br />I think this tome will be better received by those unfamiliar with his first book.  For those of us who read and admired that work, this one will be somewhat disappointing.  Still, it's well worth reading, even so.	2004-05-28

In Finding God in the Questions he has, essentially, written two books in tandem-a deeply thorough and thoughtful theological inquiry and his personal history and faith journey.  The two books-in-tandem format works very well as Johnson provides us with both intensely framed questions of faith as well as the clues and basis for understanding his own answers to those questions.<br />What I especially like about this book is that it is in fact an inquiry, not a demagoguery in wolfs clothing as so many \\"spiritual examination\\" books are these days.  I'm tired of the slew of books purporting to be examinations on faith that are in fact merely thinly disguised polemics that in fact dictate what one \\"has\\" to believe to be Christian.  Johnson here is truly in examination mode, providing a challenging list of questions and presenting his own assessment of possible answers without ever becoming dictatorial in the process.<br />Not all will agree with Dr. Johnson's conclusions.  He is obviously deeply skeptical of much of what passes as \\"acceptable\\" Christian dogma in these intolerant times.  In fact, his skepticism reaches the point where he concludes he cannot even really call himself a Christian given the prevailing ethos but rather refers to himself as a \\"follower of Jesus\\".  Obviously, those that hold the utterly dogmatic and intolerant viewpoints that so sadden Dr. Johnson will reject his conclusions out of hand-tragic given that they are the ones most in need of a truly thoughtful self examination such as the one Dr. Johnson undertakes here.<br />In the end one is left with a moving and though provoking book that inspires one to think seriously about many of the questions Dr. Johnson raises.  That, obviously, was clearly his intent.  That leaves us with a book that is a success from everyone's viewpoint.  <br />This is a truly great book.	2004-05-26

My wife got this collection for me for Christmas and I have been savoring it slowly since.  There is only one word to describe these books-awesome.<br />Not only are there over 4000 great far side cartoons, there is also an excellent forward that details the origins and evolution of the series.  Each year's section is preseded by an introduction by Larson wherein he discusses various aspects of his personal history and how it impacted the Far Side cartoon series.  Seeded throughout the books are letters to and from Larson dealing with concerns, objections, interesting \\"true life\\" consequences or just plain reader bewilderment relating to the cartoons.<br />Probably somewhere around 60% of the cartoons are in color.  The books are-to say te least-sturdily constructed.  These are printed on high quality glossy paper with formidable covers.  Larson has referred to these books as \\"hernia machines\\".  That's not far off.  You aren't going to be reading these puppies while lounging sedately in bed, that's for sure!<br />But it the end all the bells and whistles-as contributory as they are-fade to insignificance in the face of the cartoons themselves.  Larson has a wonderfully skewed world view and a real knack of adopting common objects and anthropomorphizing common critters into human wannabe's.  <br />Obviously, given a price that hovers around three figures and given the heft and size of the tow volumes involved, this is really aimed at the serious Far Side fan.  If that's you, you're going to love this collection.	2004-05-25

There was a time when I was a steady mystery reader.  Those days are long gone-I sort of burned out on the genre-but I still take in the occasional mystery.  Mostly Spenser novels, but I'll throw in another author every now and then.<br />However, back when I was a mystery junkie, Amos Walker was one of my favorite reads.  Loren D. Estleman is a first rate writer in the noir tradition.  He's equally adept at both plot development as well as characterization.  Although Estleman has a few different characters he deals with, Amos Walker is his masterpiece.  Walker is a gritty, hardboiled former Viet Nam vet now working the detective trade in Detroit.  <br />Estleman paints the fringes of Detroit with a master painters brush and Walker is right at home in that gritty urban landscape.<br />In retro Walker is present at the bedside of an old acquaintance, a madam and self described \\"former mob moll\\", who asks Amos, as a dying wish, to see to it that her cremains get back to her long lost son.  Walker agrees and has no problem tracking down the son-he's a former draft deserter still living in Canada.  He presents him with his mother's cremains and departs, only to learn shortly thereafter that the son has been shot dead and Walker is considered a suspect.  Walker determines he has to straighten things out, if only to clear himself, and thus he enters the web of deception and murder.<br />As with all Walker books, there is lots of action.  The characters are well written and very memorable.  Walker's hard charging, straight ahead, no nonsense approach is in full display.  The plot is fascinating, as usual.  This is another grand page turner in a long line of grand page turner's.<br />In fact, I so enjoyed this one that I'm going to have to go back and revisit Walker for a while.  I'm sure there have been several entries in the series since my burn out a while back.  I may have burned out-I'm glad Estleman didn't!	2004-05-24

The Devil and Daniel Silverman by Theodore Roszak is truly disappointing.  It takes the enticing premise of putting an unabashed liberal trapped by weather with a group of hard core conservatives in a rural backwater college and proceeds to efficiently kill off any elements of intrigue and interest in no time flat.<br />The big problem is the characters-the problem being that there aren't any.  All that fills these pages are unpersuasive caricatures.   There is not a scintilla of genuineness hovering about anyone in this book.<br />This problem is compounded by the fact that the college is question is drawn not so much as a college as a cult lacking any sort of believability.<br />This is doubly disappointing as Roszak has a fairly engaging wiring voice and a nice ear for dialog.  Unfortunately, given that none of his \\"characters\\" really has anything remotely interesting to say, the latter skill is pretty much wasted here.<br />I really liked the premise of this book and the come-on description on the back of the book caught my fancy-I wanted to really like this effort.

With summer upon him he decides to turn over some soil in his back yard to see what interesting plants might be seeded there.  This is the beginning of a marvelous adventure.  His experiment produces but one plant-an unknown, unusual, highly prolific plant that takes over the back yard.  Wes cultivates the plant, begins to understand it's potentialities, and starts the process of developing his own \\"civilization\\" based on the plant.  It provides food, shelter, clothing and the inspiration for much invention-time pieces, a new mathematical system, a new language with a new alphabet.  As time goes on Wes takes on the aspects of a Robinson Caruso in his own, isolated world.  <br />The story takes on a bit of a Tom Sawyer aspect as Wes' tormentors begin to get interested in all the goings on in his back yard.  Before long, they are out there with Wes, cultivating the plant, eating it's fruit, dressing in the garb of this new world, being absorbed into this new civilization.<br />The story is absorbing.  The illustrations are wonderful-lush and colorful.  There are recurring \\"characters\\" that appear in the world-basically flora and fauna, who appear in each panel, often semi camouflaged, providing younger children with a \\"where's-Waldo\\" opportunity of discovery.

And yet, each of these stories, chronicling bits and pieces of the African-American experience, is in fact extraordinary.  While complex and detailed in their structure, these stories are in fact quote amorphous upon further reflection.  These stories are open to a wide range of analysis and interpretation.  One finds oneself pausing for a while between stories as one considers the implications and potentialities of the one just finished.<br />For example, take the title story, \\"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere.\\" The title refers to the main character's coping strategy, namely pretending to be somewhere else when the pain she is enduring becomes too much. After Dina makes the dean's dubious watch list for naming a revolver as the inanimate object she'd most like to transform into during Yale freshman orientation, she becomes a sort of self-made outcast. When she meets Heather, a doughy fellow frosh who can't stop crying over a bad night with a new guy, Dina gradually learns to let her in and wonders if their relationship is something more than just platonic. Like all of Packer's stories, \\"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere\\" offers no hard and fast finale. Dina may or may not be gay. She may or may not be using her outcast status at Yale as a way of coping with her mother's death. And, she may or may not be the same protagonist, again a black loner named Dina, who alienates her roommates by eating the last slice of grapefruit in the later story, \\"Geese.\\"  <br />My experience with short stories is that they are either predominantly cognitive or predominately emotive in nature.  Reading this book is as much a cognitive as it is an emotive experience.  Packer's style at times is almost journalistic in presentation. She gives us the \\"facts\\" as she sees them and lets the reader draw his/her own conclusions.  <br />Packer's characters in these stories are often, though not always, very smart. Many are struggling to rise above their circumstances, yet they feel trapped by things beyond their control: their parents, their faith and their jobs, and-to the extent they have any-their friends.<br />Obviously, based on previous reviews, this is a collection people either love or dislike intensely.  I liked it a lot and anxiously await Packers next effort.	2004-05-20

The Russian Debutante's Handbook tells the tale of one Vladimir Girshkin, a Russian immigrant with a lot of negative inertia \\"living\\", if that's a word you can use for his pathetic existence-in New York.  Vladimir is the antithesis of his high powered parents, both energetic if unorthodox and unethical professionals (he a doctor, she an investment banker), for whom, in the traditional Russian way, he loves with unrefined loathing.  Plodding along as a lifer immigration clerk, he organizes a phony naturalization ceremony for a \\"client\\"-a whacko old man who communes with the otherworld through an electric fan-and suddenly finds himself the beneficiary of the largess of the mans son-a Russian gangster.   Shuttled off to a trendy yet depressing eastern European city where the son holds court, Vladimir proceeds to work his way into the Russian gangster life himself-with unfortunate results.<br />This is a sly, witty farcical send-up of the Russian/Eastern European immigrant experience in these days of eastward EU expansion.  Although many of the characters never attain a status much beyond the stage of caricature, Vladimir and his family are wonderfully drawn.  The situational comedy is truly superb and the action is faced paced and compelling.  Shteyngart has an ear for dialog and a wonderfully droll, sardonic writing style that perfectly matches the farce as it develops.  <br />The book is very funny in an understated sort of way-actually, thinking about it I'd say its vastly amusing rather than funny.  You never fall off the bed laughing, rather you find yourself engaged in what seems to be an eternal chuckle.<br />All in all, an excellent beach/summer time sort of read.	2004-05-20

Christopher Moore has long been my favorite author when I needed a sure fire fix of comic relief.  I still think his Bloodseeking Fiends may be the funniest book I ever read.  <br />Lamb is something of a departure for Moore, both in terms of subject matter as well as in terms of the scope of his story.  Basically, this book purports to tell the story of Jesus (Joshua in the book) that is not included in the bible-which means, most of his life story.  The idea is actually rather clever. Joshua, knowing he's someone special and cognizant that he's diving, nevertheless is clueless about what it all means and what he must do.  He decided to look up the three wise men who appeared to his parents not long after his birth to see if they can give him a clue.  So this is in fact an adventure story, a seekers story and a coming-of-age story all wrapped up in one text.<br />As told by Christopher Moore-which means that it will be unlike anything on the subject ever written.<br />For the most part the story is true to the context of it's times-with the exception that everyone seems to speak fluent, vernacular late 20th century American English!  All of the trademarks of a Moore novel are here-the irreverence, the wit, the sarcasm, the hip-ness, the fall down laughing humor. <br />It should be noted that this book will not go down well with very serious Christians with no sense of detached humor.  This is not a good choice as a \\"cute\\" gift for dour, pious old Aunt Sally.<br />This is an audacious, outrageous, hysterically funny book-a real triumph for Moore!	2004-05-20
US	53013845	RYG9YH5GZ0FMS	0553382195	866877384	Villa Incognito	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A bit lightweight, but thoroughly entertaining nonetheless.	Tom Robbins has moved through his career from the \\"small\\" novel (Another Roadside Attraction, Even Cowgirls get the Blues, Still Life with Woodpecker) to the \\"epic\\" novel (Jitterbug Perfume, Skinny Legs and All, Fierce Invalids) and has now returned to the \\"small\\" novel.  Apparently, judging from previous reviews, there's a body of folks out there who see this as a regression, a sellout or whatever.  I don't see it that way.  <br />Villa Incognito has all the trade marks of a Robbins \\"small\\" novel.  The wordplay here is more pronounced and whimsical than is usually the case in the \\"epic\\" novels-though every now and then one senses that Tom's trying a bit too hard on that score in this book.  The book has a choppier, more fragmented feel to it than is traditionally the case in the \\"epic\\".  And-what may be the real rub with many who criticize the book-the \\"message\\" here is more overtly political (and liberal) than philosophical than tends to be the case with the \\"epic' format.<br />Having said all that, this is a typical Robbins novel-recognizing that such a concept is basically an oxymoron, as Robbins worldview and writing style render the notion of \\"typical\\" meaningless.<br />The Robbins trademarks are all here:  Wacky yet somehow tangible characters, mystical happenings, philosophical rambling, a fair amount of sexual innuendo, a highly energetic, nearly stream of consciousness writing style rendered with flair and gusto.<br />Robbins also has an uncanny knack for rendering a sense of place for exotic locales which is on full display here.  His descriptions of post Vietnam War Laos and Thailand make these places seem more real than the vast majority of historical treatises or travelogues one could read.<br />This isn't a top notch Robbins book.  However, run-of -the-mill Robbins is a heck of a lot better than most of the garbage that graces the best sellers lists, and this ends up being a thoroughly entertaining read.	2004-05-18

As a reward for their unwavering patience in putting up with him while he wrote his excellent book on the building of the transcontinental railroad, David Haward Bain treated his wife, Mary, and their two children to a 7000 + mile trip out west, roughly retracing the routes of the original pioneers who settled the area.  The Old Iron Road: An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West is the literary result of this undertaking.  Part family history, part US History, part true travelogue, the book is a wonderful and highly informative look at the often sad and tragic history of those who settled the west.<br />Although it's the history that is especially compelling in this mix, that history is delivered in the way it must have been during the trip itself.  Bain is the master of the odd fact, such as the revelation that Malcom X, Marlon Brando and Fred Astair were all born in Omaha, Nebraska.  The traditional figures, such a Buffalo Bill are included, but it is Bain's anecdotes about more marginally known characters-such as Phillip Sheridan and Brigham Young-that really hit home.  Bain also goes to great lengths to cover the ways and results of the pioneer's relations and actions towards the various Native Americans disrupted by the Anglo western migration.<br />However, it is the pace itself that so obviously moves Bain.  His treatment of the many isolated and wasted ghost towns they encounter and how the development of the west proved boon to some, disaster to others is both insightful and, often, quite moving.<br />In the end, the family interactions and this \\"history\\" of their travels prove to be moving as well, especially when one is cognizant, as I was when reading it, that not long after the trip Bain's wife died of heart disease. In the end, the book proves to not jst be informative, but heartwarming as well. <br />A truly unique book that is, all in all, one of the best anecdotal historical books I have read in a long, long time.	2004-05-18
US	53013845	R5V8JQ17C96ZE	0142003891	51076004	All Over Creation: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Seeds of rebellion and forgiveness....	There are two things you need to know about Ruth Ozeki.  The first is that she's a radical, anti government, anti-corporation, anti-globalization, tree-hugging leftie.  The other is that she is a fabulous storyteller.  If you can get past the former, you're in for a treat.  If you can't, this book will irritate the heck out of you.<br />All Over Creation centers on the interactions between the Fullers and Quinns, potato farmers in Idaho, and the Seeds of Resistance, a ragamuffin bunch of activists working the anti-corporate agricultural scene with a vengeance. <br />Yumi Fuller is home for the first time since she ran away as ahe has learned her father is dying.  She's returned against her best judgment as she has been estranged from her father since the day she left.  Cass Quinn is her best friend from childhood, her family's neighbor and, with her husband, the Fullers effective landlord.  A goodly part of the book is a \\"search for meaning and forgiveness\\" story between Yumi, Cass and Lloyd Fuller, Yumi's father.  Into this volatile mix comes the Seed's, looking to learn seeding skills and techniques from Lloyd and getting in a few good activist actions on the side.<br />As is the norm with an Okezi story, the characters are vividly and sympathetically drawn.  The story-political polemics aside-is vibrant and engaging.  The book, though outlandish on it's face, nevertheless feels very real, the characters come alive, and the book becomes a page turner quite quickly.<br />There is not the slightest effort to achieve any sort of balance-as I mentioned earlier, Ozeki has a point of view and pounds it home with a vengeance.  However, it never really affects the narrative in a meaningful way.  <br />All in all a very entertaining and moving story.  I will never really agree with Ozeki's politics and worlview, but I will eagerly look forward to reading her nbooks as long as her storytelling remains this compelling.	2004-05-10

Bob Woodward has written upwards of 20 books about various organs of the Government (the military, the Supreme Court, the CIA, and so forth.  He has developed a reputation for accuracy and honesty in his narratives to the point that he enjoys what seems to e virtually unlimited access into the deepest recesses of the American government. <br />This is a remarkable book from that point of view.  How is it that Woodward can access the Presidency and the highest levels of the executive branch of government during some of the most critical and turbulent times in recent American history as thoroughly as this?<br />This access presents Woodward with an opportunity that poses great risk.  That arises from the fact that this book represents what I would call &quot;reconstructive&quot; history.  Granted, Woodward had unparalleled access to these people.  However, he writes often almost in the first person.  It's one thing to hear in an interview, for example, that &quot;Powell had reservations about the war.&quot;  That's a long way from the text, where Powell's thoughts are expressed wholly formed and in detail.<br />This is the enigma of the Woodward style.  His books are generally considered to be very accurate and true to his subjects, but at a certain level they are, in fact, almost historical fiction.  Is this Journalism?   History?  Both?  Neither?  You decide. <br />The book itself is well laid out, competently conveys a lot of complex material in an easily understood format, and does an admirable job of providing an overall context for the often heated and chaotic decision-making process about whether or not to go to war with Iraq.<br />The unfortunate aspect of the book is that it has become a political weapon for those either supportive or opposed to Bush.  The value of the book is not so much in the aspects of personal and political motivations it reveals--as interesting as all that may be--but rather in the picture it paints of how these high level decision making processes work in the White House.<br />Personally, I think Woodward the author would have been much better served by waiting till after the election to release this.  Woodward the talking head is obviously thriving with an early release, but the process of politicizing the book robs it of much of its value.	2004-04-27

The Second Death of Unica Aveyano showcases both Ernesto Mestre-Reed's considerable strengths and weaknesses.  He is a very good writer with a compelling writing style and has a knack for developing a diverse range of interesting, unique characters.  Unfortunately, he crafts here a story so complexly disjointed it's frustratingly hard to follow.  And, on occasion, his characters plod past interesting and unique into the realm of bizarre caricature.  He also indulges n plot scenarios that border on the absurd.  All in all it makes for a very exasperating read.<br />The book is based both in the US and Cuba and cuts back and forth through flashbacks so often one occasionally gets vertigo trying to keep up. There is very little early character development so one is trying to puzzle through who the players are for quite a while, a situation which detracts from the story itself.  Moreover, through parts of the book, though not others, the story juxtaposes itself against the Elian Gonzalez story (that 6 year old whose mother died trying to get to the US and who then became the focus of a huge custody battle between S relatives and his father in Cuba). There are times when you almost begin to think elian is the real focus of the story-and then he completely disappears for 50-60 pages.  Again, frustrating and confusing.<br />Unica Aveyano is a Cuban housewife and Mother with a checkered history of sorts.  Her husband, Modesto, sees her, at the age of 16, on a visit home from the capital where he is a lawyer, falls for her, stays on and woo and wed her.  She is recovering from cancer treatments and the book si told from her perspective. The real focus of the book, however, pops up in the form of their only child, Candido.  Things may be confused and frustrating up to this point but here they fall apart.  Cabdido's life history is a sad joke, a run to absurdity that is too much to bear.  There's tragedy and there idiocy-and in Candido,  Mestre-Reed crosses the line.<br />Having said all that, the fact is Mestre-Reed can in fact write-quite compelling so.  He stays in the realm of reality just enough that one is inclined to gut this one out to see how it all pulls together in the end.<br />Unfortunately, it never does quite pull together in the end and the ending itself is quite anti-climactic.<br />This is a writer with great potential.  One can only hope he hones his plot skills and reigns in his imagination a bit and actually writes the really good book that clearly he is capable of writing.	2004-04-23
US	53013845	R2Q73FBERYLEF6	074325337X	760100886	House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties	Books	3	33	44	N	N	The political &amp; economic consequences of dynastic bonding	House of Bush, House of Saud : The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties by Craig Unger is in many ways eerily similar to Kevin Phillips recent book,  American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush.  Unger focuses his area of consideration as compared to Phillips, as he considers only the Saudi connection the Bush family has cultivated over the past 30 years, whereas Phillips considers these sorts of dynastic connections by the Bush's on a much more expansive scale.  <br />The two men come to very similar conclusions.  Given their very different motivations, backgrounds and political orientations, that fact alone causes one pause as one considers what truly underlies the Bush family pursuit of political power.  <br />To my mind, Unger's book has serious flaws.  These flaws pertain less to the manner of investigation he follows than they have to do with how his politics color his analysis.  The fact that the Bush's have in fact deliberately cultivated ties with individuals and their associates whom even that must have recognized had very unsavory histories does not equate to protecting and harboring terrorists, as Unger seems to think. (Being oil men, the Bush's have had to dael with lots of despicable sorts, both domestic and foreign-it just goes with the territory, a situation not solely limited to the oil and gas industries anyway.) And, as President, Bush's responses to the actions of the house of Saud have to be guided and colored by the interests of the nation over a wide continuum of concerns and considerations. Unger here colors and evaluates both Bush presidencies too much from the standpoint of the family to family relationships and not enough through the prism of official channels and obligations.  And, his tenor here notwithstanding, many of the less savory and more unfortunate aspects of the US/Saudi relations ship date back to FDR and WW II and clearly predate the Bush/Saudi family bond.  Incestuous, underhanded deals have always been part of the bargain, as has been looking the other way as regards Saudi internal affairs.  In that respect, Saudi Arabia's not all that different than China.<br />The key question as this all relates to current events is if and how the family dynastic relations blinded Bush to seeing the evil that was growing within Saudi Arabia and the Islamic world and the threats they posed to the US.  Unger puts forward a lot of information that suggests it did but by that point in the text his obvious personal political biases are so poignant that one has to question if he has colored the facts to fit his word view.<br />On the other hand, the facts are myriad, manifest and persuasive if only in their expansiveness.  All in all, despite the flaws, one has to concur with Unger for the most part.<br />So in the end the book is persuasive but still has the unfortunate under taste of a bit of a political hatchet job.  Given that it appears that Unger did not have to color things to make his point, the book also stands as something of a failure for Unger professionally.	2004-04-18

One of the less commented upon consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union--an event that, in many ways, Nikita Khruschev set in motion--is the access into Russian documents and society the event has provided to historians trying to understand and document various aspects of the Soviet Communist experience. It is unlikely a book such as this could ever have been written before the collapse. One can only hope many more like it are in the offing.<br />Using access to documentation about and personalities surrounding Khruschev, Professor Taubman has written what will surely stand as the definitive Khruschev biography for a long time to come. Professor Taubman has vividly captured the essence of Khruschev-the insecure bombastic and idiosyncratic nature of this truly unique historical figure who owed both his rise as well as his fall to his love-hate relationship with Stalin, the man who he supported wholeheartedly and then denounced and debunked. The boo does a marvelous job of providing an insight into the truly ethnic Russian aspects of Khruschev's personality and behavior-his passions, his profanity, his impulsiveness-aspects that at once render him all too human in both genuinely sympathetic and concomitantly repulsive ways.<br />Khrushchev represents an intermediary between the cult-of-personality communism of Lenin and Stalin and the more corporate, politburo oriented communism of the Brezhnev/Andropov era. Professor Taubman also provides clear-cut and insightful analysis of Khrushchev's role in this area as well. Moreover, all of this is deftly presented within the context of the wider Soviet and international political events of the times.<br />Well written and very well paced for a genuinely scholarly historical work. This is one of the best biographies I have read in many, many years.<br />A brilliant effort.	2004-04-13

The Big Year : A Tale of Man, Nature, and Fowl Obsession by Mark Obmascik chronicles the 1998 \\"Big Year\\" Birding competition through the experiences of three participants.  <br />After reading the book I decided that Obmascik got the title a bit out of order.  What this actually is is a book about fowl obsession, Men and, lastly nature.<br />For those who don't know-which I expect is most everyone-The Big year competition is a largely unregulated contest to become recognized by the American Birding association as the person who cataloged sightings of the most bird species in North America in a given year.  Given that there are few rules, no referees and no real prize other than the acknowledgement by the Birding association, you'd think this would be a fairly laid back, congenial affair.  You'd be badly mistaken.  This is a frenetic, cutthroat and exceedingly expensive undertaking for those who want to win.<br />Obmascik follows three men who really want to win.  Two are well heeled retirees and one a I wage slave.  All three have, to be honest, lost their marbles and have abandoned life as they knew it in search of the prize.  It's a fast paced, interesting if somewhat inexplicable tale that Obmascik gives us, full of tidbits about birds and their habits as well as the in's and out's of the hunt. <br />Obmascik has a clipped, fast paced writing style that actually enhances the rendering of this tale, mirroring the angst, intensity and obsessive nature of the competition.  He deftly sprinkles in his info on birds, heir habits, best locations for various sighting and such in a manner that compliments rather than distracts from the underlying quest story.  He's objective-he doesn't allow the text to color our opinion of the story, which is good as he doesn't have to do that.  The insanity of this quest stands quite well on its own.<br />In the end Obmascik has provided a psychological window into a peculiar obsession as well as a fairly through review of the current state of north American birds.<br />All in all a quite informative and compelling book.	2004-04-13

The stories are told from radically different points of view-a Charlotte bar owner, a middle aged woman with breast cancer, an 8 year old boy-yet each is as genuine and true to its roots as the next. <br />Earley has an engaging and warm hearted writing voice and a very nice ear for dialog-both verbalized and internal.  Also, for the most part (the story Entitled Aliceville is an exception) he takes his time and fully develops his characters and themes.  One has the sense after completing each story that one has in fact read a novella though the length of the stories are consistent with the short story guidelines-it's just that the stories are so `rich' that they have the feel of being more substantial than a short story.<br />Those who follow Earley-not a great number given where his books sit in the sales ranks-may be interested to note that the last two stories develop the characters that would form Earely's excellent novel Jim the Boy, which I also heartily recommend.<br />I can't fathom why this man hasn't had more success.  He was tagged early as one of those \\"rising young author's to watch\\" sorts by all those publications that track that sort of thing and I find his work to be exceptional, but he has for some reason totally obscure to me never reached or clicked with the mass market, an unfortunate outcome both for Earley as well as all those who are missing out on a great author.<br />This will be a truly enjoyable reading experience for those lucky enough to stumble upon it.	2004-04-07

Having read Atkinson's brilliant book on the war in North Africa in WW II I was very much looking forward to this book.  Sadly, this effort is a great disappointment.<br />The book reflects Atkinson's time as an embedded Washing Post reporter with the 101t Airborne Division in Iraq during the early phases of the war there.  Although the title would have one believe that this is a book about the ordinary soldier, that's a bit deceiving.  In actuality, most of Atkinson's time was spent with Divisional Command.  There is much more on the command aspects of the war than there is on the actual experiences of the foot soldiers.  Atkinson certainly couldn't help where he was imbedded, but what develop such a misleading title when it doesn't fit the content.<br />Having said all that, the actual reporting (and that's what this tract amounts to-first party reporting) is very good.  The insights into the command structures, process and procedures of a combat unit on the move are fascinating.  To the extent that Atkinson actually does report on the experiences of the men in the field, he does his usual excellent job ob bringing the experience to life in a most visceral way.  From big picture issues to the irritating hassles that make up life on the move as  a combat soldier, Atkinson has a unique ability to render them so as to genuinely reflect the nature of those experiences.<br />Unfortunately, Atkinson also injects a lot of his own political philosophy and opinion into the text.  Surely he's entitled to his opinion.  In point of fact, a introduction that clearly states his positions and attitudes would have been fine-it would have satisfied his apparent nee to vent as well as providing the reader of a \\"head's up\\" to his bias so we could be ready for it insofar as it colored his reporting.  As it is, his political meanderings are intrusive and detract from the book in general.  Some have found Atkinson's opinions offensive.  While I don't necessarily agree with him I'm notoffended. It's just that all this ranting is immaterial vis-à-vis the object of the undertaking.<br />Another problem is that the book lacks substantive overview.  I see no reason why Atkinson couldn't have interjected some indications of how the actions of the 101st related to the wider war in general.  Granted, the intent was to focus on the 101st but having insight as to how the experiences of other units impacted the 101st and how the actions of the 101st impacted the ward in general would have been a significant addition to the text.<br />Atkinson's An Army at Dawn was one of the-if not the-best war books I ever read.  This falls way, way short of that effort.	2004-03-24

Answer-nothing.  The Vulcan of the title refers to a statue of the Roman God, Vulcan, God of the Forge/Fire, in Birmingham.  Several of the Vulcan's have ties to Birmingham and they liked the symbolism of being aligned with this figure.<br />That tidbit above goes a long way towards providing an insight into this book, actually.  This is basically an historical treatise reviewing the history of the self named Vulcan's-in real life,  known as Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Armitage, and Condoleezza Rice.  These 6 people make up the core of the Bush foreign policy making apparatus and the book details their long history of working together with-and at times working together against-each other.  It is a set of relationships that extend back as much as 30 years in some cases.  <br />As such, the book provides a primer of sorts as to the mechanics of how a \\"power elite\\", in John Stuart Mills famous phrase, is formed and maintained.  It provides insight as to how events shape ideology, how pragmatism shapes alliances, how power works and is maintained.  The book also provides insights into how the transitions between being in government-then out of government-then in government, and so on, shapes the larger \\"power elite\\" that runs the US foreign policy apparatus.  Lastly it provides insight into how the ideologies, policies and personalities of the major players in power- Nixon, Kissinger, Snowcroft and so on-shape and hone the relationships and ideologies of the aligned forces of such subgroups as the Vulcan's.<br />This is a political junkie's book.  Jim Mann, the author, is a journalist. The book reads like a journalist trying to be an historian.  Which is to say it comes across as a journalism/history hybrid.  To his credit, Mann does a commendable job of sticking on theme and minimizing themore sensational-seeking traits that seem to be congenital to modern day journalists.  There are, however, forays into personal trivia and minutia that clearly satisfy the journalist in Mann without adding anything worthwhile to the story.  Moreover, while commendable objective, there are times when the authors opinions are clearly evident.  Let's just say he's obviously not a fan of most of these folks.  That fact-as apparent as it is-detracts from the books credibility as a historical tome. <br />In the end one is left with an appreciation for the scholarship.  However, the slants and subtle elements of bias intrinsic to the text leave one with a healthy dose of skepticism as well.  Reading the book I kept remembering that old saw that \\"a competent historian can make any historical event seem inevitable\\"  This tome relies too much on the inevitability factor and too much ignores the art pure serendipity played in events and relationships.<br />All in all, worth reading, but to be taken with a grain of salt.	2004-03-23

The publishing of his second novel, The Madonna of Excelsior : A Novel, establishes Zakes Mda as a bright new star of international literature.  This novel, like his first, deals with African society?s attempts to deal with the struggle between tradition and modernity in contemporary Africa.<br />The basis of the novel is an actual event.  In 1971 19 citizens of a village in Orange Free State were arrested for violating the Immorality Act in South Africa.  Their crime?  Interracial sex.<br />The book is a fictional accounting of the subsequent lives of those caught up in this incident.<br />The focus of the story, the ?Madonna? of the title is Popi, a young lady who represents the issue of one of these sexual encounters.  She is called ?colored? by polite society and far ruder things by most others.  Her life transverses the crossover from white apartheid rule to black native African rule and she fit in neither world, being ?to black for the apartheid regime and to white for the African regime?.<br />Most of the figures in this novel emerge as people deserving, if not of sympathy, at least of understanding.  It is one of the strengths of the book that Mda?s politics?if he has any?are entirely absent from the narrative.  This is a book about people and their experiences, not a vehicle for political rhetoric.  Not that the tragedies of the political situation in South Africa don?t emerge?they most surely do.  They do so within the context of the story, however.  <br />In the end the villains in contemporary South Africa are not the apartheid enforcers who instigate the action with their contemptible raid, nor those caught up in it, or even those who discriminate against these people.  The villains are those, former opposition leaders resisting the injustice and corruption of apartheid, who now are the legislators, town councilors and such, who allocate jobs, housing, favors and the like to themselves, their wives, girlfriends, family and cronies.  All of those who, assuring that everything would change under a regime, instead ensured that nothing in fact would be any different for those without power.<br />In the end this is a book about people, stuck in an uncomfortable middle, despised by the old guard in their time, despised by the new guard in the present, trying as best they can to come to terms with their pasts, present and futures.  It is a singularly insightful and moving tale. <br />The Madonna of Excelsior is one of the best books I?ve read in years.  It?s definitely a ?must read? book.	2004-03-23

McDonald was a master &amp; McGee was his masterpiece.<br />I was cleaning out some bookshelves not long ago and came across this book.  It's been years since I'd read a Travis McGee novel so I decided to reread this one.  That proved to be one of the best decisions I've made so far this year reading-wise.<br />Back in the 1960's John D. MacDonald wrote 21 Travis McGee books (along with a large number of stand alone books as well).  They were among the most successful thriller/suspense books of the times and remain, in my opinion, one of the very best thriller suspense series of all time.<br />MacDonald utilized a very Hemingway-esque writing style-terse, to the point, very abrasive and macho.  His characters were first rate across the board, whether they be a series regular or a bit player.  Even inanimate objects came to e serious characters, as in Travis' car and houseboat.  Also the series is easily distinguishable as all McGee novels titles use the name of a color in the title.<br />The books are dated in the sense that they use language and mannerisms common to the time.  This is an observation, not a criticism.  They are authentic to their time in every way and therefore are, essentially, timeless.<br />A Deadly Shade of Gold is a pretty standard McGee thriller.  The story involves McGee's dual purpose of finding and avenging the killer's of an old friend who suddenly reappears in South Florida asking McGee for help while trying to recover a hoard of pre-Columbian gold figurines his friend says were stolen from him.  The action moves from Florida to Mexico to LA and involves the usual MacDonald elements-exotic locales, unique, dangerous characters, unleavened greed, lots of action, romance and lots of explicit violence.<br />If you're tired of the run-of-the-mill, politically correct factory produced mysteries that seem to proliferate these days and want an authentic suspense/thriller experience, give Travis McGee a try-you won't be disappointed.	2004-03-23

The Swallows of Kabul : A Novel by Yasmina Khadra (actually, Yashima Khandra is a pen name.  The author is actually a former officer in the Afghani military) is a small yet powerful novel.  Set in the Afghanistan of the Taliban, it presents the story of three individuals:  Mohsen Ramat and his wife, Zunaira, as well as a Kabul jail guard named Atiq Shaukat.<br />Moshen and Zunaria meet while both are students during the reign of the Russians in occupied Afghanistan.  They marry and go on to professional careers. Then the Russians are expelled and things go radically downhill for the couple.  The Taliban take over.  The Taliban decide Moshen's ties to the previous regime were too close and they destroy the couples house, leaving them living in a hot, stifling mud hovel.  Naturally, under the Taliban Zunaria's legal career ends and she is more or less stranded inside the hovel, forced to wear burqa on the rare occasions she leaves her home.  To say their relationship is under strain is an understatement.  It collapses completely over two separate, ugly incidents.  First, Moshen participates in the public stoning of a prostitute, an act that enrages Zunaria.  Then, while out on a walk, Taliban enforcers find their behavior unacceptable, club Moshen on the street and take him onto a mosque for hours of interrogation.  Zunaria sees Moshen's acquiescence in this act as cowardly and truly begins to loath him.  Shortly thereafter a marital spat at home erupts and gets out of control.  Moshen falls, hitting his head on the wall, and dies.  Though the death is in fact accidental, Zunaria is charged with murder and thrown into jail.<br />Enter Atiq.  He is a guard at the Kabul prison where Zunaria is interred.  Atiq is a man at war with himself.  He hates his job, tending and terrifying people whom he realizes are generally innocent of any real crime other than coming to the unfortunate attention of the regime of the moment.  His home life provides even less succor as his wife, whom he no longer loves, is dying an awful yet slow death.  <br />Atiq falls in love with Zunaria almost on sight and this event triggers a remarkable string of events which, to delineate, would mar significantly, I feel, the appreciation of the story.<br />Throughthe rendering of these events we are privy to the destruction and degradation of a society undergoing incessant political and social turmoil.  It's not a pretty picture.  However, the novel is brilliantly written, the story is full of paradoxes and Khandra effectively evokes the terror and futility of life under the Tliban for the common Afghani. If not a happy tale, it is, somehow, a hopeful one that amply rewards the reader who can navigate it.<br />That takes some doing.  To read this novel is both an intellectual as well as a visceral undertaking.  Readers should recognize that this is not a happy story that contains explicit renderings of horrific violence.  Those who do not care for such violent fare may want to avoid the book.	2004-03-22

Some of the \\"mysteries\\" here cover issues as mundane as a missing dog.  Others are \\"mysteries\\" mainly in a cultural context, as is the case with Walter Moseley's contribution, \\"Bombardier\\".  It's all in all a very diverse collection that, in total, ought to have something among the 22 submissions that would appeal to virtually any reader.<br />If there can be said to be an underlying theme to these stories it would be, generally speaking, an examination of the underlying forces of society, relationships and personality that motivate one toward the life of crime.  If that's the question, the fact is the answers-to the extent there really are any-are all over the board.<br />The writing throughout is universally good.  The proofreading and editing, by Eleanor Taylor, is slipshod and uneven.  One is left with the sense Ms Taylor didn't so much edit this collection as assemble it.  While this is often a source of mild irritation it doesn't detract in a serious way from enjoying the book.<br />In the end one is not so much moved by the mysteries presented as by the wit, superstitions, mores, aphorisms, attitudes and-most keenly-the shared experiences of the authors, specifically as it relates to the minority experience in America.  <br />All in all, a very good diversionary, beach type of read.	2004-03-22
US	53013845	R1AP8MJEKFJX0R	0385512104	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: A Novel (Alex Awards (Awards))	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Exotic, eclectic, quixotic, brilliant	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night by Mark Haddon is one of the most unique books I have ever read.  Essentially it is the \\"journal\\" of Christopher John Francis Boone, an autistic 15 year old English schoolboy.  One evening he finds a neighbors dog dead, the poor animal having been impaled by a garden pitchfork.  Initially Christopher is presumed to be the perpetrator of the crime.  It turns out he is, in fact innocent.  Christopher resolves to find the actual perpetrator over the objections of nearly everyone about him-except for his school counselor who urges him to go ahead and keep a journal of his discoveries-the text of this book.<br />To call the book quixotic is an understatement.  It reflects the internal schizoid aspects and contradictions of Christopher's mind.  He is a brilliant mathematician yet ignorant of the most mundane human emotions.  The dissonance extends to even the numbering of the chapters, which are successive prime numbers.<br />This stands as the best window into the aspects of a disease since I read Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn (featuring Tourette's Syndrome).  To read this book is in a very real sense to experience autism.  The unique worldview, the idiosyncratic behaviors, the fears, frustrations, misunderstandings of the wider world and withdrawal into the self of the autistic personality are all there.  This is accomplished not just through effective writing but also through unique us of fonts and graphics in some cases.<br />The book also effectively describes the arc of frustration, exhaustion, fear and anguish that goes along with being close to one with autism.  <br />The story is marked by interesting turns and twists that keep one involved. Haddon has a somewhat distanced yet assessable writing style that provides a distinctly-though not overbearing-English voice to the proceedings.<br />This is an ambitious and accomplished novel.  It's amazing that it is the product of a first time author.  It is a fascinating, absorbing, brilliant romp of a book that I appropriate for readers of nearly all ages.<br />Truly a Five Star effort!	2004-03-18

The problem with publishing a travel guide to the 1000 Places You Must see Before You Die is establishing a fundamental criteria as to what constitutes a \\"must see\\" sight.  Is it historical relevance?  Natural wonder?  Intrinsic beauty?  World renown?  You get the idea.<br />How you answer that question goes a long way to determining what sort of book you will have.  The problem with Schultz's book is that she never clearly addresses that question and, therefore, has aggregated a series of recommendations that, in trying to fit all audiences, never succeeds in fitting any particular audience.<br />There has been much criticism in previous reviews of her focus on hotels/resorts, restaurants and \\"obvious\\" tourist attractions.  Obviously, these folks have a very much narrower view of what constitutes a \\"must see\\" venue than does Schultz.<br />This is the factor that drastically limits the utility of this book-in trying to be all things to all people it serves the interests of very few people.<br />Frankly, it seems obvious to me what is needed is a series of \\"must see\\" books based on narrow criteria, such as \\"The 1000 Natural Wonders You Must See Before You Die\\" or \\"The 1000 Architectural Marvels.....\\" or the \\"1000 Best BBQ Places You Must eat At....\\", and so on.<br />Having said all that, this tome does indeed provide, for certain geographical areas (primarily North America and western Europe) a decent generic guide to key attractions along a very wide continuum of choices.  That is to say, this would be a good starting point to plan out a trip, but should not be considered a good `sole source\\" as a travel guide.  If nothing else, it can help you narrow down how you view what constitutes a \\"must see' venue when traveling.	2004-03-16
US	53013845	R2DOF265JINJVA	1400041147	873250864	The Dew Breaker	Books	3	33	38	N	N	The Dew Breakers never quite lives up to its hype.	Danticat's a hot commodity these days.  Her first two novels have received much acclaim and this effort has been much anticipated.  It hasn't hurt that Haiti is very much in the spotlight as the book becomes available, with all the attendant images of violence that accompany a Haitian coup.  So, all in all, reading The Dew Breakers should have been a blockbuster experience.  Sadly, it was not. <br />The protagonist of The Dew Breaker (so named because he would habitually come for his victims in the very early morning, when the grass was wet with pre sunrise dew) is a former torturer for the Duvalier regime, now, as the book opens, a reformed family man living in suburban New York.  His sadism is chronicled through a series of vignettes centering on a swath of his victims.  Essentially, this novel is a loosely related series of short stories that uses the device of the protagonist as the glue that's supposed to hold the whole enterprise together.  This is not an entirely successful undertaking as the protagonist is so steeped in shadow and mystery as to never truly come into focus enough to be an identifiable entity.  Some of the vignettes are truly moving and, on their own, have genuine emotional impact.  That impact dissipates, however, as the intrusion of the literary device that underpins the book often in fact acts to dispels emotional intensity and thus rob the narrative of its power.  <br />Danticat has a writing style that is often described as simple and elegant but which, to my mind, often can only be described as plain.  This book is easy to read by there is a decided lack of any sort of lyrical quality to the work.<br />However, the real problem with the book is it never even attempts to answer the questions it raises.  History is full of monsters who were attentive parents, kind to their mothers and loved their pets.  The question is-and Danticat broaches it-how do these freaks accommodate the inherent contradictions of their nature?  History is also full of monsters who, for whatever reason, turn their back on their former life, reforming themselves into, if not something noble, at least into something no longer a monster.  Where does the sadism, the cruelty, the inhumanity go when this happens?  Danticat makes no effort to resolve these issues.  At best, the book can be said to be infused with a sense of moral ambiguity regarding its protagonist.  Even the question of whether the author intends for one to grant the torturer absolution for his sins is left indefinite.  <br />In the final analysis, the book sinks under the burden of great expectations.  It does not live up to its hype and reviews.  That's not to say it's a bad book-it's not.  It's just that, when all is said and done, the feeling one is left with is that this particular glass has to be viewed as half empty. That is a great disappointment given the hopes I had for the book going in.	2004-03-16

The major thing that strikes one, especially given the post-war realization that WMD's weren't in Iraq, is Blix's pre-war conviction, based more on a gut feeling rather than any special insight, data or analysis, that WMD's probably did exist in some significant concentrations.<br />The other interesting conclusion of the book is Mr. Blix's assertion that the fault for the conflict rests, basically, with Saddam Hussein.  Granted, Mr. Blix does have some very pointed, and not very complimentary remarks to make about the positions and actions of Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair.  He definitely feels that the inspection process should have been accorded more time to do its work and is pretty critical of some of the timelines the Americans and British placed upon the process.  On the other hand, he explicitly points to the fact that the Iraqi regime never, at any time, lived up to either the letter or the spirit of UN resolution 1441.  He also agrees that, once the military buildup had reached a critical mass having it simple sit in lace indefinitely was not a viable option for anyone.  The 1441 resolution was unanimous, the force was present, the decision to comply or defy rested with Saddam.  It was, in effect, says Mr. Blix, Saddam' own obduracy that, in the end, did him in.<br />In the end what Mr. Blix communicates is an overwhelming sense of frustration. He truly believes that, given a reasonable continuation of proximate implied force and sufficient time, the inspection regime would have worked.  The fundamental question, which Blix can present but not answer, is whether, in the final analysis, WMD's were the reason or the pretext for the war.  If the former, his argument for more time is persuasive.  If the latter, it's irrelevant, as any of a slew of other pretexts could have-and would have-- been concocted by the Americans and British to justify invading.<br />I doubt this book will change many minds--those who opposed the war will find fodder for their cause.  UN haters will simply see evidence of the anti-US bias they always see at the UN.  However, for the objective reader--if there are any out there--this is a uniquely informative read.	2004-03-16

Reading Two of Us : The Story of a Father, a Son, and the Beatles by Peter Smith I was reminded of one of my own Beatle moments growing up.  I was over at a friend's house waiting for him to finish getting ready to go watch a baseball game.  His younger brother, then in 6th grade I'd imagine, and I were watching the American Bandstand show where the first films of the Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper facial hair was showing.  After the film Dick Clark was asking some of the teen girls in the audience what they thought.  \\"Yuck!  They're so old looking and ugly\\" was the consensus.  I remember turning to Roger and asking what he thought?  \\"Those girls better get used to it,\\" Roger said, \\"because in 3 months everybody's gonna look like that\\".  A statement that proved to be very prophetic.<br />I mention this because as you read Two of Us you will have many such recollections, both dealing with your own youth and adolescence as well as those of your kid's if you are a parent.  And that is what makes this book so enjoyable-you are flashing back over your own life and experiences as you share those of Peter Smith and his son.  The shared experience adds greatly to the narrative and makes reading this book a very personal sort of experience.<br />Unfortunately, it's a somewhat disappointing experience as well.  The problem is that Smith takes this work in a lot of directions that may have been meaningful for him personally but are pretty much boringly meaningless detail to the reader.  There's a lot of introspection about the relationship between the author and his father-an entity so fleetingly described as to be little more than a caricature to the reader. Thus, all the prose associated with the comparison of Smiths relationship to his dad and comparing that to his relationship to his son is more irritating than enlightening.<br />Smith is also wont to let his metro-sexual side intrude into the text.  That he thinks his son is \\"beautiful\\" is ok-but he keeps using that phrasethroughout the book.  The touchy-feely aspects of the book wear one down after a while.<br />Lastly, there's a dissonance to the thread of the book.  The Beatles bring son and father together and, as could be expected, eventually, as the boy grows, that's not enough any more. They grow out of this device.  There is no indication that Smith is working on a way to keep the relationship alive outside a Beatles context.  This is supposed to be a book about an adult trying to engage a youth-yet the adult seems to be the one who's having trouble growing and communicating here.<br />However, for a time there is a connecting through the vortex of the Beatles, and there are some magical aspects to this relationship and the story of it.  In the end one is left with a sense of wonder that has more to do with the Beatles than with this father-son combo-what's is the power of their existence that creates a dynamic that can, and often does, bridge generations?  If the book does one thing well, it's stimulate the reader to examine that phenomenon within the context of his own experience.  In the end the power of the book is that Sam and Peter's experience highlights and reveals our own experiences.	2004-03-14

Imagine that!	American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush by Kevin Phillips is a bit of a mess.  The problem largely results from the fact that Phillips apparently never truly decided what the book was supposed to be:  a examination of the Bush dynasty, a general historical review of dynastic political families in general or a political hatchet job.  It tries to be all three and in fact fails at being any of these things, though there are interesting aspects to all three themes.  Its a classic case of missed opportunity all the way around.<br />The great strength of the book is the historical review of the bases of Bush family wealth and power and how that has translated into a political dynasty of sorts.  Are there skeletons in this closet?  Of course there are.  (As there are in the Kennedy closet, the Roosevelt closet, and so on.)  Have the Bushies leveraged their wealth to their economic and political advantage.  Again, of course they haveas have others.  If there is an issue thereand Phillips makes a strong case that there indeed is an issues hereits that the Bush dynasty has arisen not for even the incidental goal of providing public service in general but almost entirely as a huge cronyism machine.<br />Phillips tries to compare the Bush dynasty of other American dynasties without much success.  The expected convergences are there and well documented.  The aspects of historical accident and contrasting experience are ignored or glossed over.  Thats bad enough.  To worsen the mix, Phillips tries to also do the comparison thing with European dynasties.  This is really stretching the purview and the whole historical aspects of the exercise pretty much fall apart.<br />So what give this book 4 stars?  Because, insofar as the actual cataloging of the Bush history and experience go, the book is thorough, thoughtful and highly detailed.  Its also a very depressing.  <br />So is this a merely hatchet job?  A political gotcha?<br />Probably not.  Phillips is a heavy weight observer of American political history and events. Moreover, hes a very conservative fellow, though no longer a Republican by affiliation.  (Apparently the more radical aspects of Republican pandering to the religious right finally got to him and he switched to being an independent.)<br />In the end each reader has to decide if the Bushies are dedicated public servants or merely well healed hogs feeding at the public trough.  On the whole, no matter how you look at it though, this book does not paint a very flattering picture and Id like to think that is would give pause too all but the most ardent Republican partisans as to the nature of the Bush presidencies.	2004-03-14

The Murder Room is typical PD James material-perhaps a bit too typical if the truth be told.  While there is always a bit of dé*jà vu with James, the continual focus on insular professional settings for her settings and interminable introductions t set up the action are beginning to border on triteness. <br />What saves the day is James' usual literary finesse as a writer.  A PD James mystery is an English mystery with a vengeance.  All of the quirkiness and idiosyncratic mannerisms and behavior of the Queen's good people are on abundant display.  Descriptions of the furniture are just as detailed and as lovingly rendered as the descriptions of the characters.  The pacing is not exactly glacial but no one has ever referred to it as anything remotely related to `fast paced\\".  In other words, a PD James mystery is a book to be read and savored, not an experience to be slopped through.<br />In that respect, this is a pretty standard James effort.  The characters are well developed and sympathetically rendered.  The mystery is fully developed and moves along nicely.  The violence is properly muted but nevertheless unsettling.  The procedural aspects of the investigation are reasonable and well detailed.  <br />There are flaws.  James seems to be becoming ever more enamored of long and trifling descriptions of ever more arcane and musty institutions.  She attempts-rather halfheartedly-to introduce a love interest for Inspector Dalgliesh that never really takes off and in fact adds zip to the story line. As I mentioned earlier, the introduction and set up process seems interminable-the initial action doesn't actually begin to get underway till somewhere about page 120.<br />On the other hand, an average PD James book bests most others better work, so one cant complain too much.<br />So, all in all, not a bad read but far from James best.	2004-03-12

Winner)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A novel of celebration, loss and escape	The Consuelo of the title is the adolescent daughter of a Puerto Rican family living in a San Juan residential area in the 1950's.  The novel is on a small scale about the trials and tribulations of the family as it deals with the vagaries of life in Puerto Rico at this point in time.  On a larger scale the novel projects the overarching changes occurring in Puerto Rican society as American influence and cultural encroachment undermine many aspects of traditional Puerto Rican life and culture.  All of this is viewed through the prism of Consuelo's turbulent, adolescent world view.<br />Judith Ortiz Cofer uses a variety of literary devices to create parallel aspects of divisiveness and turbulence within the family and Consuelo's family.  Her father is very American oriented, her mother very traditionally oriented.  The schizoid aspects of  the greater society engendered by the breakdown in traditional cultures are mirrored in the family by the appearance and development of obvious mental disease in Consuelo's sister, Mili.  And so on.  Some of this works well, some of it comes off clumsily.<br />The strength of the book rests in the integrity of Consuelo's character as well as in the author's ability to evoke both the spirit and the instability of 1950's Puerto Rico.  Her ability to create a truly empathetic and genuine Latino sense of family within Consuelo's home is also a strength, enough so that the artifice of some of her mechanical device manipulations are rendered, if not moot, at least minimal in terms of affecting the story.<br />On the whole I found this to be an excellent if somewhat disjointed novel.  Cofer is a poet as well as a novelist and essayist and the prose has a poetic, well paced quality that adds effectively to the ambience of the story.  Her characters generally are well fleshed out and sympathetically presented.  The ambiance of the book is good if the mechanics are occasionally irritating.<br />In the end the quality of the story and prose,as well as Cofers ability to genuinely render a sense of the time and place involved, overwhelms the weaknesses of the book.  This book is definitely worth reading.	2004-03-12

As you'd expect in a series this long, there have been high points and low points.  2 to 3 books back things had flattened out and Spenser was getting too predictable.  That has changed.<br />In Bad Business Spenser is involved in tailing an executive at Kinergy--a company that might as well have just been called Enron and been done with it--after being hired by the executive's wife.  it soon transpires lots of people are tailing lots of people at Kinergy.  When the executive in Spenser's sights is killed, things get even more complicated.<br />After 31 novels Parker has a pretty full corral of stock characters to draw from.  He's fairly sparing in this one.  The focus here is more on the story.<br />The story's pretty good.  It's more complex and suspenseful than has been the norm lately--more intricate and less predictable.<br />But the good news here is that Spenser himself is in very good form.  Back is the wry, wisecracking, violent intellectual that has built this series into what it is.  The re-energizing of Spenser is a welcome development.<br />Parker is also branching out a nit--from the purely noir conceptualization to a bit of homage of other great mystery writers.  The ending is a group-room scene reminiscent of-and worthy of--a Nero Wolfe novel by Rex Stout.<br />All in all a very nice diversion and a very pleasant read.	2004-03-11

In the US, 1963 comes to mind.  There are times that are embedded in world consciousness in a more or less similar way-though these tend to be more pronounced, longer periods of unique historical impact-World War II and the Great Depression come to mind.<br />1968 stands as a unique year that is indelibly embedded in world consciousness.  1968 stands as the culmination of the birth of the globally connected economy.  Seeds of youthful unrest and rebellion sprouted up, seemingly spontaneously, on a world wide scale in a more or less coincident fashion.  The two above enumerated facts are singularly interrelated, and that's the key to reading Mark Kurlansky's 1968 : The Year That Rocked the World.<br />The seeds that led to the tumult of 1968 arose out of the ongoing globalization of economic infrastructure-particularly in terms of instant, globally available communications-as well as an historically unique alignment of youthful rejection of established political hierarchy and authority in a wide variety of places for a lot of  coincident but largely unrelated reasons.<br />Kurlansky both succeeds and fails in his efforts to establish, organize and explain these phenomena.  The author has a fairly unique and eclectic resume as salt, cod and such have been previous topics of study for him.  There is obviously a big difference in trying to chronicle the aspects of a year as opposed to an object or substance.  Kurlansky is not altogether successful in making the leap.<br />The dynamic that most clearly pointed to the tumult to come in the late 1960's first became apparent with the rise of the Beatles as an international cultural phenomenon<BR>In 1963.  The Beatles represented an almost cosmic change in cultural DNA across almost all borders.  Youth worldwide had found a technological and social mechanism of interconnectedness and communication that has continued ever since (witness the Internet).<br />Suddenly, there was a worldwide outlet fore communicating the ingrained aspects of youthful rebellion.  This rebellion was being stoked by the byproducts of the longstanding, ossifying effects of the cold war as well as the burgeoning upheaval towards personal empowerment that such movements as the Civil Rights movement embodied.<br />These rebellious influences had widely disparate origins, aims and expression, from the \\"flower-power\\", anti-war movement in America to the Cultural Revolution in china.<br />Kurlansky does an admirable job of covering a lot of this ground (though not all of it-the Cultural Revolution is largely ignored, for example).  His stream-of-consciousness style of writing in this instance does much to evoke the emotional tenor of the times though it does little to help organize the historical aspects of this material in any sort of disciplined way.  He also does a fairly admirable amount of analysis, in a sort of dissembling way, as to cause and effect issues.<br />However, the man has a particular view and bias towards he \\"flower-power\\" aspects of the situation.  Moreover, he seems to be perpetually in search of understanding himself, not the sort of situation that lends itself to meaningful historical conclusions.<br />In the end we are left with a unique, informative genial mess of a book that stands up well as a sort of thoughtful, introspective, historically oriented memoir but a book that must be considered a failure as any sort of serious historical exercise.	2004-03-11
US	53013845	RS0IKYWB8ZWEW	0515121207	101271349	Proof	Books	5	17	19	N	N	One of Francis' best books	Dick Francis reminds me of a master craftsman of say fine furniture.  His quality and style are such that, though all his pieces are different, they nevertheless bear the mark of his unique style and craftsmanship.  Once in a while you'll come across a piece that's so unique that at first you're not absolutely sure it's one of his but a very short inspection convinces you that, yes, as odd as this piece may be, it's his.<br />That's a long way of alluding to the fact that Francis' books tend to be highly formulaic.  For the most part you know what you are getting before you even open the cover.  The formula consists of a highly independent, iconoclastic, extremely self-reliant protagonist who, for reasons he doesn't fathom, has become the center of a storm that, before everything has played out, will involve him in intrigue, murder and at least one act of horrific violence aimed at him personally.  There will be some sort of at least marginal if not central theme of horse racing and a specific theme to the book-precious gems, photography or, in the case of Proof, the wine business.<br />Proof is a bit of a departure form the formula.  The horrific violence is right up front in the form of a ghastly automobile accident.  Tony Beach, the protagonist of this accident is present to experience it though he emerges unscathed.  The accident does, however, bring him into contact with a private investigator.  Their shared experience leads them to get ot know one another and the investigator, realizing Tony has some skills he needs, drags him into one of his cases.  Thus Tony is an involved party to, but not the focus of the intrigue of this novel.<br />Moreover, Tony is not your typical Francis protagonist.  Recently widowed, Tony is trying to modulate grief within the context of his own insecurities of not having lived up to the rough outdoorsman-horse fancier image of his very renowned father.<br />The end result is a Francis novel minus the usual comfort level of the formula. While it can be a risk for an author to diverge from his comfort zone, Francis handles it here with aplomb.  Francis is one of the greatest thriller novelists ever. The result is one of his best novels ever.  That's not a bad combination!<br />This is a great read both for the Francis fan as well as the casual suspense-thriller reader.	2004-03-11
US	53013845	R1QPHGE4QWGVIL	0451209028	521051759	Coffee And Kung Fu	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The Kung-Fu guide to love and romance	Karen Brichoux's debut novel rises above the muck and mire that represents so much of today's \\"chick-lit\\" though the clever use of literary device-in this case, focusing the narcissism and angst of the 20-something urban dating scene through the lens of Kung-Fu philosophy, or at least as much Kung-Fu philosophy as one can derive from endless watching of Bruce Lee movies.  Te result is an enchanting and nimble novel that far transcends the norm of this genre.<br />The novels protagonist is Nicci Bradford, a 20-something stuck in a mindless and boring job as a copywriter at a Boston publisher (why are all these chicks always stuck in dea end publishing jobs in these novels?) who lives alone and is incredibly lonely (imaging that!)  Her coworkers are  sympathetic to her plight and try to set her up with a stream of guys, all of whom are evaluated through the Kung-Fu lens, and all of whom are found wanting.<br />Finally one of the company's customers latches on to Nicci and Phase 2 of the chick-lit formula kicks in-Nicci is no longer lonely but angst's over the fact her new beau isn't perfect-risch, handsme and engaging, yes-but not perfect, except in bed.  (There he's superlative and his superlative-ness is detailed in fairly explicit detail.)<br />Of course in the middle of all this the young, goofy-looking poor guy enters into the picture and Nicci is further torn about her romantic life.<br />The rest is pretty much rote for the genre.  There are no major surprises and, basically, the fundamental story is highly formulaic.<br />However, the constant ruminations, evaluation and consideration of what's happening as juxtaposed with the worldview and philosophy of the Kung-Fu films is truly entertaining.  Moreover, Nicci is much more a complete person as a character than is the norm for this particular genre.  The characters are pretty well developed and the storyline, thought hardly innovative, still is better than average.  The writing is well above average.  The story's fairly steamy in spots but never in an offending way.<br />All in all, it adds up to highly entertaining beach type reading.	2004-03-11

Lindsey may be Chinese-American, but she has inculcated all the meaningless, narcissistic aspects of genuinely American 20-something life very well, as well as it's lack of perspective.  (For example, quite a bit of the book is taken up by Lindsey's analysis and evaluation of the \\"Hoarder of all Things Asian\\" phenomenon-the habit of some Anglo guys to obsess about and solely date Asian women-while she seems oblivious to the fact she herself exhibits a corollary \\"Hoarder of all Things Anglo\\" phenomenon.)<br />This book would not merit much notice or attention-or much of a recommendation- except for the fact that Kim Wong Keltner can write.  Her portrayal of Lindsey and her idiosyncratic family is both warm hearted and at time touching.  Her Sa Francisco is just as wacky and vibrant as the real thing and catches the counter-intuitive aspects of SF urban life very well.  (For example, Lindsey is employed by a local magazine called Vegan Warrior.  Just the sort of thing ones apt to come across in San Francisco.)<br />The problem with Dim Sum of Al things is not the writing but the story.  It's fairly waek, trite and has already been done a zillion times before.  That it manages to rise above all this and keep the readers attention is a testament to Keltner's writing skills. <br />If Ms Keltner can provide a story to match her skills I have no doubt that would be a book well worth reading.  This effort is little more than beach-time diversion at best.	2004-03-09

Its pretty clear from reading other reviews for Train that people either really like or really dislike this book.  I really liked it, although I can see why some wouldnt.<br />Train is the story of three people caught in a relationship triangle that is coincidentally both tenuous and gripping.  Train is actually a caddy on a ritzy LA golf course named Lionel Walk.  The book opens with him caddying for a group that includes a La COPMiller Packard.  The caddy and the cop develop a quick bond out on the course.  The relationship develops further as two of Trains companions at the course kidnap and Norah Still and her husband on their luxury boat-raping Norah and killing her husband.  Packard gets the case and falls in loveor at least falls in somethingwith Norah.<br />This swirl of event keeps the three in loose yet intense contact throughout the book.<br />The underlying themes involve racism, brutality, love and, to be honest, abnormal psychology as all three of these characters carry significant psychic baggage that forms their behaviors and thoughts and directs them into places and situations that normal folks would care to visit.<br />The book stands as a very elegant character study.  Moreover, it presents a very rich and compelling noir vision of 1950s LA.<br />The book contains scenes of brutal, explicit violence.  There is an abundance of generalized but not particularly explicit sexual situations.<br />This is not a book for the faint hearted but fo those who can take it its a fascinating look into the realm of the seriously disaffected urban flotsam of 1950s LA.	2004-03-09

The Miracles of Santo Fico is the sort of book you need to keep arund handy for those times when you are felling totally disaffected, alienated, disjointed--whatever--and in need of a humanity fix.<br />The story of the residents of an isolated, long forgotten Tuscan village, this book revolves around the return to the village of a native son, Leo Pizzolo, who departed years earlier under urgent, mysterious circumstances.  As Leo begins to reintegrate himself into the local scene his return sparks a lot of unsettled introspection on the part of many Santo Fico residents relating to the history of the town and the circumstances of Leo's departure.<br />This is a sweet, gentle, warm stroll through the peaks and valleys of local village life and the bonds and relationships it fosters-and destroys.  <br />Filled with lovingly drawn, genuinely interesting characters, redolent of the ambiance  of the Tuscan countryside, infused with a sense of warmth and love of mankind, this is a book that will bring tears to your eyes and fill you with a sense of peace.<br />There aren't many books like this out there any more-relish this one.	2004-03-09

I'm a great Christopher Moore admirer.  I think Bloodsucking Fiends may still be the funniest book I ever read.  <br />Fluke has its moments but on the whole is a major disappointment.  The characters live up to expectations-unfortunately they deserved a better story.  <br />You know there's going to be some weird stuff in a Moore novel but here the weird stuff is just too weird.  The convoluted nature of the weirdness is text draining-too much prose is devoted to explaining the weirdness-and the end result is the story becomes disjointed, diffuse and generally bogs down to the point one loses interest.<br />On the other hand, many Moore trademarks are fully evident-interesting and enjoyable characters, exotica in terms of locale and setting, nip, laugh inducing dialog.  The problem is the flaws overwhelm the positives and the end result is a rather mediocre book overall.<br />Personally, I think Moore is overreaching.  Lamb was ambitious and, on the whole, a success but some of the flaws in Fluke were making early appearances there.  Moore needs to go back to letting the story carry the action and reign in his imagination a bit.  If he does so, all will be well I think.<br />But, anyway, in the meantime Fluke represents a decent but by no means typical Moore extravaganza.	2003-11-24

However, I ran out of reading material thanks to several seriously delayed flights and had to grab something on the run at IAH and this was the most likely thing immediately available.<br />I still probably wont be much into Westerns but I certainly expect to give Miss Dallas another look.  The Chili Queen is a book that completelyand very pleasantlysurprised me.<br />The book works on several levels.  The characters are thoroughly and affectionately drawn, Miss Dallas has an engaging and absorbing writing voice andmost unexpectedlya wickedly complex and deceptive sense of narrative and plotting.<br />Although ostensibly a western, the Chili Queen slowly but surely devolves into a bit of a psychological thriller cum detective novel while maintaining its western character and setting.  This evolution into the thriller realm is deftly and skillfully managed is such a way that one is as surprised by many of the turn of events as are the characterswhich is the way a thriller is supposed to work.<br />The end result is a book of many facets, colors and subtle complexity that far outstrips the dynamics and construction of what I think of as the prototypical western novel.<br />This is an excellent novel that would appeal to a very wide audience.  I can heartily recommend it.	2003-10-03

Harry Niles, the ne'er-do-well son of a Baptist missionary in Pre-WW II Japan is the protagonist of this fine thriller, a character closely patterned on the Rick Blaine character of Casablanca.  Harry has had an adventurous youth growing up in the risqué Asakuza \\"arts\\" area of Tokyo under the rather derelict \\"supervision\\" of his Uncle.  He's the proprietor of \\"The Happy Paris\\", actually an American Expat bar in Tokyo.  Ostensibly a simple bar owner, Harry is in actuality a seemingly perpetual thorn in the side of the local Tokyo authorities-from the police to the military.  The problem is Harry doesn't fit in with the form for a gaijin-a barbarian foreigner.  Though definitely foreign, Harry has been raised in Japan virtually all his life and is, in terms of behavior, outlook and temperament, more Japanese than American.  Moreover, his boyhood school chums have all grown into roles of prominence in pre-war Japan  That Harry has in fact helped the authorities out in some singular cases diminishes their suspicions of him not one whit.<br />And they are justified in their suspicions-for Harry is as American as they come in his heart-of-hearts and in fact is scamming the Japanese Navy.  Or is he?  That's the question vexing the authorities as they prepare for Pearl Harbor.  How this all plays out forms the basis of an excellent suspense novel.<br />A first rate novel, as it turns out, populated by interesting, exotic characters, a vivid presentation of pre-war life in Japan, complex plot twists and a very high level of suspense that sustains itself throughout the book.<br />This is Smith at his best.  He excels in the historical suspense novel and in Harry Niles has developed a truly engaging and absorbing character around which he has crafted a first class story.	2003-09-16

In Jim the Boy Tony Earley has created a sweet, lyrical, truly affectionate novel that lovingly conveys the coming of age of a 10 year old boy in Depression Era North Carolina.  <br />This is a character driven book and Earley proves himself to be a true artist when is comes to the fine--yet undervalued--art of character development.  Jim comes across as a genuine 10 year old boy.  All too often, in my opinion, young characters in novels are just like kid characters in a movie, where a 24 year old is playing a 14 year old and comes across exactly like a 24 year old portraying a 12 year old. <br />Jims behavior, thought patterns, emotive responses and relationships are those of a 10 year old.  Thats not to say they are primitive or simplistic-they are in fact the complex, mundane, heartwarming genuine aspects of a kids life.<br />The character of Jim would be a success unto itself but Early brings his artistry also to the other characters in this very fine novel.  Jims mother and 3 uncles (who are helping to raise the fatherless boy) are equally well crafted.  Even the bit playersa traveling salesman the uncles know, the overpowering yet absent grandfather who has terrorized the family since kingdom-come, the kids in the school yard, are also lovingly crafted.<br />The other thing that marks this book as special is that it lacks The Great Eventthis is the novel of an ordinary boy growing up.  Ts not that there isnt hardshipthe boys father is dead, theres the tyrannical grandfather, theres the usual skirmishes and close calls and so on, but there is nothing here that any ordinary 10 year old wouldnt have experienced and dealt with in the normal course of events.<br />Which brings us to this books ultimateand extraordinaryachievement.  Jim the Boy is a story that effectively and lovingly demonstrates the extraordinary beauty, dignity and honor intrinsic to the simple living of the ordinary life. The magnificence of ordinaryfamily love, community life, friendship.  The fact that decent human beings can create something out of what appears to be not much of anything.<br />That is, the fact that our own lives are filled with beauty and wonder.<br />This is a truly wonderful book EVERYONE in the family can read and enjoy.	2003-09-16

The character of this book sets out to recreate this concept-with very disastrous results.<br />The problem isn't that the character is a sicko-which he definitely is-it's that he a boring, insipid, unconvincing sicko.  The completely non-emotive sociopath has been done before-see Silence of the Lambs-but even totally non-emotive sociopaths need some sort of character to be interesting.  This fellow is a boring a last years fashion news.<br />The book also rotates around the concept of this exercise as an intellectual experiment in social engineering.  Unfortunately the character comes across as a 15th rate intellect and the whole exercise is therefore colored as demented sadism pretending to be something else-unconvincingly at that.<br />In the end the book would have been just as interesting-and relevant-had it been about some sort of mechanical device that has run amuck and maimed people in it's path simply by circumstance.  That's what this protagonist is-an animated device.<br />It's all very dreary and cold and uninspiring and-ultimately-boring.<br />Very, very boring.	2003-09-16

Back Story, the latest in Parker's Spenser series, is a retro turn reminiscent of a previous Spenser novel, Pastime.  In Pastime Spenser's quasi son, Paul Giacomin, approached Spenser when he discovers that his (Paul's) mother has disappeared and asks Spenser to find her, bringing up all sorts of unwanted info in the investigations wake.  (Read Parker's Early Autumn if you are interested in how Paul becomes Spenser's quasi son.)<br />In back Story Paul approaches Spenser on behalf of a friend of his. Her mother was killed in a bank robbery in Boston nearly 30 years ago when she was just a child and she wants Spenser to determine what really happened and who did the deed.  As is always the case, a lot of unwanted baggage is dredged up and Spenser has to persevere though the client gets cold feet and there are some very bad guys who are not pleased by the turn of events.<br />The Spenser series has become a sort of hit or miss thing lately.  The most recent book previous to this, Widow's Walk, was pretty lame.  The edition before that, Pot Shot, very strong.  I don't know if his other series are distracting Parker too much or what.  One of the real pleasures of this series earlier years was the genuinely good story telling that marked each new entry.  <br />That's not the case anymore.  However, Parker can still hit the occasional home run in this series and back Story is a home run.  The story is marked by an intensity reminiscent of the early Spenser novels.  The characters are vibrant.  The violence convincing.  This one is a winner.<br />If only they could all be this good.	2003-06-26

The Death You Deserve: A Novel by David Bowker is in effect a modern day horror story along the lines of Exorcist or Silence of the Lambs with one big difference-this book is very funny.<br />The story center on Billy Dye and his boyhood friend-now professional hitman-now known as Rawhead.  <br />Their friendship as boys was based on a shared interest in the occult and the classic horror stories of the time.  It's a friendship cut short  by the incarceration of Rawhead after he stabs a fellow student.<br />Billy grows up to be a failed journalist and novelist of the occult.  He comes to the attention on one Malcom Priest, the head of a violent Manchester gang who signs Billy on to ghost his autobiography.  Billy's  a professional sarcastic SOB and he finally alienates Malcom to the point  that he sets Billy up to be hit by Rawhead-his hitman of choice though one he has never seen and knows nothing about.<br />As Rawhead takes aim at Billy's head with his 44 Magnum he realizes that this is his boyhood chum and spares his life.   This, predictably, does not please Malcom and so the chase is on.<br />Up to this point the book stands as a run-of-the-mill mafia tale.  Once rejoined, however, the mutual attraction that Billy and Rawhead have for horror takes over and elements of a classic horror story dominate the action.  Rawhead puts Billy up in an old, apparently haunted house-the night hours are filled with groans, screams and the smell of blood.  Flies and maggots infest the property.  Billy's instinctively knows that there's something wrong here but can't bring himself to depart both because he's a target of subsequent hitmen Malcom hires and needs Rawhead's protection as well as his attraction to the supernatural aspects of Rawhead's persona.<br />The action-and there is pleanty of action-builds to a tumultuous ending.<br />Bowker can write. The book is fast paced, hip and riddled with sarcastic and farcical humor.  It's also, at points, scary as hell.  It's also riddled with lots of profanity and some truly horrific and graphic violence.  Readers should beware-this is not a book for the easily offended or those who have any sort of queasy constitution.<br />This is a wild romp of a story.  If you can handle it, you'll be glad you went along for the ride.	2003-06-23

He is best know for large, well crafted yet minimalist surrealistic stories mostly set in modern day Japan.  His stories are populated by idiosyncratic, eccentric characters beset and buffeted by strange, overpowering circumstances.<br />This book marks a significant departure in terms of prose style.  After the Quake is a slim, stylistically contained series of short stories.  There is a very basic-and very weak-underlying theme, the Kobe Earthquake of the early nineties, which is mentioned in each tale but hardly forms the basis of the stories.  Basically, this is a series of tales of alienation and anomie that are exacerbated and/or mitigated by the events of the earthquake-that is, the quake is a catalyst, not a protagonist within the stories.<br />Beyond those considerations, this is classic Murakami.  The characters remain idiosyncratic and eccentric, the plot lines surrealistic, nearly hypnotic, yet absorbing, the circumstances besetting and buffeting the characters still overwhelming.<br />I wouldn't have thought Murakami would be an effective short story writer-his style in almost all aspects argues against it.  I was wrong.  This is a truly gifted writer, as he amply demonstrates once again with After the Quake.	2003-06-08

I have truly enjoyed both of Miss Jen's novels--Typical American and Mona in the Promised Land--and I was really looking forward to this collection.  I wasn't so thrilled by the time I was into the third story in this collection as I though this book was shaping up to stand as the classic example of someone who can write novels but can't write short stories. Then, suddenly, things improved dramatically.  By the end I was convinced that Miss Jen can write short stories but, apparently, needs a much stronger hand in selecting what is working and what isn't, as this book is filled with good examples of both types of story.<br />Anyway, the second half of the book is much, much stronger than this first half.<br />The elements that make Miss Jen such a good writer are there throughout-a very gifted ability to render the immigrant experience, a strong writing \\"voice\\" and a potent sense of the drama that fills ordinary life combined with a gifted sense of timing.  The problem with the first few stories is that they seem incomplete and disjointed.  That dissipates quickly as the book moves along.<br />This is a book that's well worth the read but one has to stick with it and not let the early sections distract and irritate you to the point where you don't truly enjoy the really good parts.<br />Hopefully Miss Jen will manage any future collections more adroitly.	2003-06-08

His work is obviously a retelling of the life he has lived and those he has lived it with rendered with a thin, classy veneer of fictionization to protect the innocent-and virtually everyone Calvin seems to come into contact with would qualify as the innocent.<br />Tepper Isn't Going Out is a gentle political farce on the one hand and a nostalgic ode to the more mundane aspects of urban life in New York-particularly the dilemmas of parking in Manhattan-on the other hand.  In Trillin's capable hands both stories cohabit the pages amicably together.<br />While the blurbs on the book give the impression that this is a rolling in the isles sort of comedy the reality is that this is a gently amusing book full of chuckles and good feelings rather that some slapstick comedy. <br />It works because the characters are genuine, the farce mostly plausible, the action sufficient to keep interest and the story genuinely heartfelt-as is all Trillin's work.<br />This is a slim novel well suited to a long days plane travel-a book to comfort, calm and amuse.<br />I loved it.	2003-06-08

(One would expect the resemblance to be bothersome but in fact it is not.)  <br />As is to be expected, the real life aspects of the Carter and Sharp relationship are nothing like their on-stage/on-screen antics.  It is the development of this relationship and it's evolution from small time success to larger success and, ultimately, dissolution, that constitutes the core of the novel. To a great degree, it's not a pretty story in the way so many show biz tales aren't pretty stories.  However, McCracken deftly avoids the over maudlin through deft timing and timely wisecracking from Carter, the narrator and, naturally, the straight man of the duo.<br />McCracken excels with the offbeat, and while this duo is ostensibly more mainstream than the protagonist of her first novel, the excellent the Giant's House, their circumstances-economic, emotional, romantic, legal and so on, provide McCracken with ample ammunition to delve into the offbeat and eccentric, areas that provide very fertile ground for McCracken to plow through.<br />In the end the book is about both the constructive as well as the destructive aspects of fame on personality as displayed through the very different experiences of the two protagonists.  That McCracken can develop tow such divergent characters and keep the reader engaged and interested in both, despite the fact that both are somewhat loathsome, self-centered and immature in the extreme, is a testament to her skills as a writer.<br />A very solid follow-up to her first novel and a very engaging read overall.	2003-04-22
US	53013845	R2654NLBT1HM7U	0061098795	657088689	The Wailing Wind	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Hillerman's the master of the "character suspense" novel.	I've read every one of Tony's Hillerman's novels and I never tire of him.  It's not that the books are great mystery classics--it's pretty obvious from the word \\"go\\" in The Wailing Wind that Wiley Denton is guilty as sin, and that's often the case in a Hillerman novel--there's really no \\"mystery\\" in the mystery. And they certainly aren't action packed--in this book the initial murder is so ambiguous that's it's not even recognized as a homicide for quite a while, and the other body is 20 years old and doesn't appear till the next to last page.<br />What Hillerman brings to the table is a genuine talent for building suspense throughout a narrative, an ability to draw in depth and engaging characters and a \\"native's\\" feel for the rites, customs attitudes, history and feel of the Indian Country of the southwest and it's inhabitants--Anglo, Hispanic and native American.<br />What's unique in the past couple of books--as well as this one--it that Hillerman uses three distinct protagonists to develop the aforementioned world views from a multigenerational set of viewpoints--those of the older, semi-retired Leaphorn, the middle-aged Chee and the rookie cop, Manuelita.  All provide a unique perspective on both the story at hand as well as the backdrop Indian country setting--as much a character in Hillerman's novels as the characters themselves.<br />The Wailing Wind is a fairly typical Hillerman novel--the story's about average and the secondary characters sufficiently idiosyncratic and engaging. If the story itself isn't quite one of his best--and it's not--the handling of it is superb and the suspense factor unusually intense.<br />On the whole, a very satisfying read.	2003-04-21
US	53013845	R1APITOH2D2QGX	1573229385	655539900	The Frog King	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Well written but extraordinarily formulaic.	The Frog King, Adam Davies' debut novel, is a very well written yet mediocre effort.  Davies obviously has talent and the book is sufficiently engaging to keep up ones attention but the book has fatal flaws.  <br />The biggest problem is that there is nothing particularly novel about this novel, other than Davies penchant for using obscure and highly derivative language--occasionally to the point of deliberately resorting to crepuscular obfuscation (two words not actually used in the book, though they easily could have appeard).  On the whole this comes off as little more than a highly polished and melodramatic caricature of every previous Young-Jerk-Alone-And-Struggling-To-Make-It-In-The-Big-Apple genre novel ever written.  Davies works too hard at developing the angst-ridden amorality and anomie of the protagonist, Harry Driscoll, to the point where he loses all pretenses of humanity.  He attempts to compensate for this by developing Harry's love interest, Evie, into virtual caricature of enlightened sainthood.  <br />Evie manages to retain elements of humanity, though this does not help the novel, really.  It merely accentuates the caricature-ish nature of Harry all the more while undermining the validity of the character of Evie.<br />However, Davies does have a deft touch when it comes to scene and secondary characters.  His descriptions of New York-from penthouse to the cardboard homes of the homeless, are right on.  His sense of the intensity and absurdity of new York publishing society is marvelous.  The deft handling of some of the secondary characters-particularly Keeno and Birdie, show an ability to envision and construct actual, viable characters.  He has a great sense of pacing and a brilliant sense of the hard edged, articulate sarcasm that passes for humor among the Big Apple's intelligentsia.<br />One can hope Davies will try to branch out into areas not so clearly autobiographical for future novels.  Clearly this is a great novelist in the making.My sense is that if he can balance a novel where the story maintains equivalence with characterization, he could write a truly great book.<br />As for The Frog King, it's an interesting, if somewhat disappointing, diversion.  A creditable if not a particularly noteworthy debut effort.	2003-03-19
US	53013845	RAFRJBZK83GAV	0393051447	550346223	Khrushchev: The Man and His Era	Books	5	78	86	N	N	Absolutely brilliant.	One of the less commented upon consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union--an event that, in many ways, Nikita Khruschev set in motion--is the access into Russian documents and society the event has provided to historians trying to understand and document various aspects of the Soviet Communist experience.  It is unlikely a book such as this could ever have been written before the collapse. One can only hope many more like it are in the offing.<br />Using access to documentation about and personalities surrounding Khruschev, Professor Taubman has written what will surely stand as the definitive Khruschev biography for a long time to come. Professor Taubman has vividly captured the essence of Khruschev-the insecure bombastic and idiosyncratic nature of this truly unique historical figure who owed both his rise as well as his fall to his love-hate relationship with Stalin, the man who he supported wholeheartedly and then denounced and debunked.  The boo does a marvelous job of providing an insight into the truly ethnic Russian aspects of Khruschev's personality and behavior-his passions, his profanity, his impulsiveness-aspects that at once render him all too human in both genuinely sympathetic and concomitantly repulsive ways.<br />Khrushchev represents an intermediary between the cult-of-personality communism of Lenin and Stalin and the more corporate, politburo oriented communism of the Brezhnev/Andropov era.  Professor Taubman also provides clear-cut and insightful analysis of Khrushchev's role in this area as well. Moreover, all of this is deftly presented within the context of the wider Soviet and international political events of the times.<br />Well written and very well paced for a genuinely scholarly historical work. This is one of the best biographies I have read in many, many years.<br />A brilliant effort.	2003-03-19

This works better as a \\"memoir of soup making\\" rather than a book of soup recipes.  Mr. Curry has an engaging and stimulating writing style and many of the stories that surround the recipes are quite delightful.  The recipes themselves leave a lot to be desired.  A lot of the ingredients I've never heard of and a lot of the soups are designed to be made by someone with unlimited time and patience available-not the norm in the typical American household.  Some of these concoctions seem to have been designed to be exotic merely for the sake of being exotic, not because they provide superior soups.  Of those recipes that seemed doable on our schedule with what we normally have at hand for our routine cooking, all were fine but none exceptional or particularly noteworthy.  <br />If offbeat soup making is your life, then this might be a good choice.  For most people, I'd say look for it on a friend/acquaintance's bookshelf and read it for the stories.	2003-03-04
US	53013845	R3A2NLYZ08U3OC	0670031720	28976631	Drop City	Books	5	19	24	N	N	Boyle is moving into his prime-this is a great book.	I've had an uneasy relationship with the authorship of T. Coraghessan Boyle.  He has always obviously been a gifted and imaginative writer with a great sense of both grandeur as well as an eye for the circumstances of society's more marginalized inhabitants.  More than that, he has a great eye for, and ability to render in words, the physical surroundings of his characters-whether it be the beauty of the Alaskan wilderness as rendered in this book or, say, a desolate roadside ravine as so definitively described in The Tortilla Curtain. And, on top of all that, he's a great storyteller.<br />However, there has always been an unpleasant aspect to Boyles work.  Boyle has typically written as if angry at the unseen reader-as if he knows unauthorized persons are entering his world.  There has been an aggressiveness and sharpness to his style that grates and irritates.<br />Until now.  With Drop City Boyle seems finally to be able to write without this underlying angst.  The result is his first fully formed and truly accessible work.  Finally the reader can sit back and enjoy the story.  And the story is wonderful.<br />With a keen eye and laser like efficiency Boyle recreates and dissects the \\"free-love\\" communal subculture of the 1970's.  This is not the romanticized nostalgia trip of an aging hippie.  This is as much a social commentary as it is a novel.  Boyle seeks to-and succeeds in-demonstrating the incredible naiveté, hypocrisy and stupidity that was at the root of the communal life.<br />As usual the story is intricately woven and rendered.  The plot is well developed and constructed and plays out in a well-paced manner. The characters here are among Boyles best ever-fully formed, evocative, ingratiating in an albeit loathsome sort of way.  It is, however, his mastery of  his description and rendering of the physical environments and  surroundings of the communes that really sets this Boyle effort apart. <br />That and the maturity to write a story that allows the reader full entry.<br />This is a great book.	2003-03-01

Wiess' Crash Profits: Make Money When Stocks Sink and Soar! is really two books in one.  On one hand it is a review-and very stinging commentary-of the shenanigans that corporate executives and Wall Street investment bankers have engaged in over the past decade that have done so much to undermine investor confidence in the markets.  On the other hand it is an \\"investment guide for hard times\\" which-as all such endeavors do-assures the reader of sure fire profits in the future.<br />This book works much better as social commentary.  Mr. Weiss is a well known, very credible and knowledgeable critic of Wall Street.  Here he presents a very well constructed picture of just how the excesses of recent time came about and how they have affected investment environments. His stinging indictment of the corporate world  not only effectively relates events but also provides a very detailed picture of how these events have affected the average investor's views and outlook vis-à-vis the markets. <br />As an investment vehicle the book leaves much to be desired, as most of these books do.  The problem is these books are aimed at the \\"average\\" investor but, like so many of its predecessors, it focuses on the wrong aspects of economic life in the middle class.  It's not that the investment advice given is particularly flawed, it's that it fails to provide the guidance that is really needed at this point in time to really improve the economic lot of the middle class family.  It talks endlessly of \\"investment\\" and virtually ignores debt, which in point of fact is the real scourge of the middle class' economic status.  The \\"average\\" middle class family has approximately $40,000 a year in family income.  It also has approximately $5000 in outstanding credit card debt.  With an average interest expense of 18%, the average family's major \\"investment\\" is carrying what appears to be becoming a perpetual, high cost debt.  On a long term basis, reasonable investments will generateanywhere from 5-10% in return.  That's true of Mr. Weiss' strategies as well.  Yet Mr. Weiss speaks virtually not at all to the drain debt wracks on total investment return.<br />If your are debt free, this makes a reasonable investment guide.  If you are not, you'd be much better off buying a guide to managing debt.  Regardless of you financial situation, this book is worthwhile as a historical review of the dynamics of corporate excess in the `90's.	2003-01-31
US	53013845	R2136NF7RB1S6L	0375509038	863073313	The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush, An Inside Account	Books	4	30	39	N	N	Well wrinten, thoughful and insightful look at Bush WH	This is the first major work by a true insider from the Bush White House and it paints a very detailed and vivid picture of the nature of Bush's approach to both the Presidency as well as how his White House staff operates.<br />Frum is a former Wall Street Journal writer and has written on conservative social and political issues.  He worked in the White House as a speech writer, focused on economic matters initially and then refocused on international issues after September 11th.  While he's philosophically aligned with Bush he nevertheless was somewhat uninformed about Bush both personally and politically when he first appeared on the national scene (weren't we all) and somewhat ambivalent about him when he went to work for the Bush Administration.  That sense of ambivalence comes through subtly throughout the book and lends it, to my mind, an additional layer of credence.<br />The boom is very detailed and wide ranging.  It covers policy, Bush's personal leadership style, his political philosophy, the usual White House intrigues--pretty standard stuff for this sort of effort.<br />Several tings set this book apart, however.  One is the simple dearth of genuine, detailed insider White House reporting that has emerged on this administration to date.  Frum deftly explains that this is a function of several factors--this White House's penchant for security, the unusually close knit operating structure in the White House as compared to, say, the Clinton era, but most especially the incredible loyalty George Bush naturally inspires.  Frum gives this penchant for loyalty the full treatment and it's a fascinating phenomenon to behold in this day and age.<br />Another truly interesting facet is the ways in which the deep Christian fundamentalism of many bushies affects both the policy aspects of the administration but also--much more interestingly to my mind--the general day to day operations and culture of the White House. Frum also gives this the full treatment and itis, again, a fascinating look at this extraordinary aspect of the current administration.<br />Frum also gives us an insider's insight into the wiles and intrigues of Washington politics.  This is best exemplified in the \\"Axis of Evil\\" phrase, which Frum essentially originated (though his actual phrasing was \\"Axis of Hatred\\" modified to evil by Bush himself) and the aftermath of Frum's getting \\"credit\\" for it.<br />The only negative I'd voice--and it's why this gets 4 rather than 5 stars--is that Frum inserts himself into the meat of the book a bit too much for my taste.  This is neither billed as or written as a memoir as much as an insider takes on the WH--not on Frum.  It's a minor quibble but nevertheless a bit less focus on Frum's personal situations would have been welcome once his qualifications, bonafides and so on were established.  It's not so much that what he writes isn't interesting (he tales about being a foreign national (Frum's Canadian) working in the White House and the complications that this causes are often interesting and even entertaining, but nevertheless distracting from the main focus of the book.<br />In the end though it's what he learned about Bush and what he came to believe about his abilities and destiny that are key, and they form genuinely fresh and enlightening look at the man, who he really is, and what he really stands for.  What he has to say won't in general shock anybody who's read the title of the book, it's nevertheless firm and thoughtful insight about a man whose destiny is so critical and about whom we really, truly know very little.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-09

This is the 8th in Rule's series of \\"true crime\\" series.  I haven't read any of the previous editions (a friend gave this to me for Christmas) so I can't compare it to any of her previous efforts.  However, I read some of the Editorial and Amazon\\".com\\" reader reviews of previous editions and from that I'd assume this one is representative of the series as a whole.<br />This book centers on one Dr. Anthony Pignataro, a New York state plastic surgeon who is portrayed as the most extreme sort of control freak and bedrock sociopath.  I'll spare the details of his crimes as I think getting into this blind will make for a much better reading experience.<br />Rule has a fast paced and engaging writing style on the whole.  The book-as I gather is the rule-is fairly short, so this amount to a very quick read.<br />I was on the whole pretty disappointed, not that my expectations were all that high.  The book was given with high recommendations but it read too much like an exploitative TV \\"reality\\" show to me.  The book is highly charged-but extremely melodramatic.  One can almost feel oneself adopting the husky, driving, modulated reading voice counterpart to a TV announcer's voice as one reads it.<br />For all that, Rule's prose has impact-one has nearly visceral reactions to what one is reading at times.  This should be a better recommendation for the book but, again, there's something of an exploitative feel to the whole thing.  One can almost see Rule sitting at her computer refining her scenes till she thinks to herself-\\"There-that ought to get them to gagging\\".<br />If a high impact, visceral reading experiences are your thing, this is your book, and, probably, your series.  I suspect however that many who take these on are your garden variety \\"mystery\\" genre reader and this probably is too intense and unsettling for that sort of person.	2003-01-03

There's an old adage that posits that the real outcome of a war is to teach one to hate one's allies more than than opne's enemies. Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World by Margaret Olwen MacMillan and Richard Holbrooke outlines why this old adage exists.  The book covers the 6 month period in mid 1919 where the victorious allies of WW I converged to carve up the spoils of war and how this exercise set the stage for most of the subsequent conflicts of the 20th century.<br />While the book focuses on the Big Three Personalities of this exercise--Wilson (United States), Lloyd George (Great Britain), and Clemenceau (France) who dominated the critical aspects of the Paris Peace Conference-this focus doesn't detract from providing an encompassing review of the entire process as well as a detailed analysis of the devastating results of the conference.  It delineates all too clearly how the best intentions can be overwhelmed by both insatiable avarice as well as unencumbered and unchecked egos in conflict.<br />This is a timely book.  As we are poised to invade Iraq and effect \\"regime change\\" it would be wise to look at a previous exercise in managing post war victory to be reminded of both the complexities as well as the risks involved in such an undertaking.<br />Although an expressly historical tome, this is a well written and fast paced read.<br />Probably the best historical work I read in 2002.

I am a huge Russo fan but I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this book going in.  Russo's novels are huge, densely written affairs-with the possible exception of Straight Man, which is huge but more lightly written.  I had my doubts that Russo would be able to pull of a consistently good series of short stories if only because his overall style seems so antithetical to the requirements of that genre.<br />Russo, in fact, pulls this off with aplomb. I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that I still think his novels are much better-but this is a brilliant collection.<br />The book consists of seven stories all told from a distinctly different point of view-a professor of literature, a ten year old boy, an aggrieved and put up father, and so on.  There is no particular underlying theme that unites these efforts.<br />The stories bear a distinct Russo style-fairly densely written, highly introspective, multiple, remarkably fully fleshed out characters (a particular Russo trademark) for short stories, a decidedly small town flavor throughout.  The characters are engaging, the situations both dramatic and comical, the stories original and fresh.<br />My only complaint is that in a couple of cases I simply didn't want the story to end-it was as if what I'd read was a chapter in a much larger novel-and the rest of the chapters were missing!  Very frustrating!  <br />I personally think that if Russo wants to use the short for the novella would be a better choice-say three 100 page efforts.  I believe this would afford the freedom (or tyranny, depending on your disposition) of the short story in a format more suited to the complexity of his writing style.<br />On te other hand, it's pretty much gotten to the point that anything he writes works for me-I just wish he were more prolific.<br />An excellent book!	2002-12-17

Mark Hertsgaard's The Eagle's Shadow has a great premise-travel the world and interview a wide-ranging cross section of foreigners to garner their assessments of the USA.  Had Mr. Hertsgaard actually followed through on that premise and executed the book he describes, we might have been treated to a unique and informative text of some true value.<br />Unfortunately, what Mr. Hertsgaard has done is to cull out a few quotes to use as launching pads for his own thoughts, concerns and whatnot.  This boos is all about how Mr. Hertsgaard feels about the USA and very little about what other folks think and feel about the USA-0-or at least all those out there who disagree with Mr. Hertsgaard.<br />Several earlier reviewers complain of the books liberal tilt-and it is liberal.  That doesn't bother me.  While I'm pretty conservative, I'm not one of those conservatives who feel that being liberal is a crime or a prima fascia basis to presume mental defect-I can too well remember my earlier, far more liberal days.<br />No, the issue isn't Mr. Hertsgaard's liberalism, it's his deceit-he's sold us one thing and delivered another.  This book is a classic literary \\"bait and switch\\" and that's a real shame.  I think I would have enjoyed and benefited from the book Mr. Hertsgaard failed to write.	2002-12-16

His previous books have been uniformly excellent and serve to demonstrate his  tremendous talent as a journalist as we as his incredible range of play, covering professional tennis and golf, college basketball, and so on.<br />In The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever we see Feinstein at both his best-and his worst. Overall the book is great.  No one can render an athletic event and the emotions and feelings surrounding it better than feinstein.  In this book, Feinstein does a masterful job of painting the whole picture-particularly the culture within the NBA of the time that fostered the environment wherein this event took place.  Feinstein also does a masterful job of thoroughly conveying the aspects-in terms of personality, history, temperament and relative stature-of the participants.  By the time The Punch is thrown, we feel like we are there reliving the event-no small accomplishment given that the only visual rendering available is a horribly unfocused, grainy black and white photo on the book cover.<br />Where the book breaks down-and where Feinstein generally has problems-is when Feinstein starts to track the consequences of The Punch.  Those parts dealing with the players professional careers are fine. It's when we get to \\"social\\" issues that things break down.  I have a hard time believing that Washington's later financial problems or Tomjanovitch's drinking problems can all be laid at the feet of the event in questions.  Rudy drank before The Punch, and Washington's problems seem to founder more on bad choices in investment advisors rather than any deep seeded psychological problems.<br />Nevertheless, this was an epochal event in terms of both the future of the NBA as well as the future of these two players, and while I wish Jon would leave the psychoanalysis to psychologists, the book on the whole is a trulygreat rendering of the effects extreme violence can have on a sport and it's participants.<br />A must read for sports fans in general and pro basketball fans in particular.	2002-12-02

But every time I'd see her she'd inquire about the book, so, with a sense of dread, I sat down to read it.<br />It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually whiten a very different sort of story.<br />Grumpy Luther Krank and his sweeter wife, Nora, having just shipped their daughter off to Peru and a stint in the Peace Corps, decide to skip Christmas this year to forgo the gifts, the tree, the decorations, the cards, the parties and to spend the dollars saved on a 10-day Caribbean cruise. Luther wants a vacations from all the Christmas stress and, besides, the cruise will cost less in the long run than indulging in all the holiday hoopla common to the Krank household at that time of year.<br />Unfortunately for Luther, his decision places him in the vortex of a social storm. Friends, family and neighbors weigh in to communicate the lack of wisdom in such a decision-it seems that Luther's expenditures-or, more precisely, the lack of them--are an issues fort many of these folks.<br />The book is a comedic farce-casting comical aspersions on the social conformity, holiday hoopla and overt commercialism that have come to be so much a part-if not the reson for-Christmas in the U. S.---particularly in the 'burbs.<br />A last minute development cause Luther to reevaluate this plan and provides a window for all to reevaluate the meaning of Christmas as well.<br />This is a sweet story with cranky, quirky-yet recognizable characters.

In The Half-Mammals of Dixie: Stories George Singleton uses the thematic device of a focusing locale as the basis for this collection of offbeat, quixotic and lively short stories. The locale in this case is the rural backwater burg of Forty-Five, South Carolina.  All of the stories are either set in--or in some way involve the denizens of this little town.  There are a few characters that populate several stories to provide thematic coherence throughout the narrative.<br />The stories themselves focus primarily on the fringes (though a good cross section of those fringes) of Forty-Five society--if such a small town can be thought to have either fringe--or society--for that matter. <br />While the book is very enjoyable overall the quality of the stories varies considerably.  There are moments of incredible hilarity counterpoised by moments of complete boredom.  In too many places one senses that Singleton's trying just a bit to hard to make the characters too off the wall, and the whole exercise can then seem a bit too contrived However, a gem of a moment shortly follow and redeems the whole exercise.<br />On the whole a good read. If Singleton can improve on overall consistency he'll be a first class short story writer.  However, at this point he's very good, and that's better than most.	2002-11-23

As much as it pains me to say it, for Hornby is one of my favorite contemporary writers, How to be Good represents a step backward for Nick Hornby.<br />The saga of the somewhat dysfunctional Carr family of suburban London, the book is Hornby's first effort at writing from the female perspective.  While I want to credit him for broadening his horizons, I have to say in all honesty, this doesn't work well.  It's not that Nick doesn't have a real knack for illustrating the ironies and idiosyncrasies of modern relationships-he does.  And it's not that his acerbic and caustic-but right on the money-wit has deserted him-it hasn't.  It's just that his take is a peculiarly male one that does not translate consistently well to the female point of view. Therer are moments where it looks like Nick is A l m o s t T h e r e, but in the end the sense of things just isn't quite right.  Part of the problem is the male-female point of view, but there also seems to be some sort of dynamic to the married state Hornby can't quite seem to get a handle on-his relationships oddities seem more \\"natural\\" in their weirdness when framed outside the institutional realm.<br />On the other hand, Hornby at not-quite-his-best is still very often much better than most other authors, so while the book represents a bit of a disappointment, it nevertheless is a very entertaining and amusing diversion.  It contains Hornby's usual cast of slightly-off-the-wall characters, provides many laugh-out-loud moments and does raise some interesting points regarding the state-of-the-relationship 15-20 years on-the boredom, the complacency, the weariness that can overwhelm a marriage and a family.  It also provides an interesting take on exactly what it means to \\"be good\\" and what motivates people insofar as assessing what \\"goodness\\" means to them personally.<br />So, all in all, while not Hornby's best work, it's still a pretty enjoyable effort overall.  I'm certainly glad I read it.	2002-10-29
US	53013845	R1VS2H1EOD74QC	0060188731	546555129	Bel Canto: A Novel	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A major departure--and accomplishment--for Patchett.	Up to this point Ann Patchett has specialized in quixotic looks at small snippets of live on the edge in fine detail.  A runaway wife if The Patron Saint of Liars, an obsession with the relative of an employee in Taft, a most unconventional marriage in The Magicians Assistant.  All of the quite excellent books took in depth looks at the psyche of an outsider and his/her interactions with a very small circle of antagonists.<br />In Bel Canto Patchett widens the scope of her work without dramatically altering--while yet significantly expanding--her habitual writing model.  In effect she has created an ensemble mechanism witch allows her to effect her approach and methodology within an expanded and dynamic environment.  The expansion arises through the employment of an environment of radically different characters of extraordinarily divers experience and social status.  In previous works the characters were all \\"of a type\\" if you will and, to some extent, offered the reader a shared experience, though differing visions arising from that same experience. The dynamic comes from the interactions between-and the understandings thus achieved-by the various characters.<br />The backdrop for this undertaking is a large-scale hostage taking situation in a \\"fictional\\" South American country (seriously suggestive of Peru).  A band of revolutionaries, bent on kidnapping the country's President, are foiled when he skips the event in question to watch a soap opera.  Encumbered with a huge lot of hostages-industrialists, politicians, diplomats, staff and various wives and children, the guerillas quickly jettison the staff, wives, children, etc., and hunker down with the rest.  It is through the interactions and interplay between the holders and those held that Pratchett engages in the examinations and explorations which constitute the hallmark of her novels.<br />What is important here in not so much the plausibility of the full cast of characters-which some seem to take issue with-or the verity of the Stockholm dynamic-a bone of contention for other critics.  Rather it is the interplay-and resulting sense of intimate discovery-- of people suddenly marginalized.  And in this realm, Patchett is a master.<br />I have read-and can heartily recommend-all of Miss Patchett's work.  I wouldn't necessarily cast Bel Canto as her best work, but it is certainly her most mature and accomplished novel to date.<br />One of the best books of 2002 in my opinion.	2002-10-29
US	53013845	R3989JLXSVJRWV	1860468357	749038842	Death and the Penguin	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Quixotic, bizarre, amusing, engaging romp of a story.	Andre Kurkov's Death and The Penguin provides an interesting--if somewhat improbable--look into post soviet life in the Ukraine.  The protagonist of this wild tale is Victor, a thirty something, sort-of aspiring novelist.  \\"Sort-of\\" because, in fact, Victor can barely produce a coherent one page short story.  Victor bangs out his pathetic efforts in the company of his pet penguin Mish, whom he rescues from the Kiev zoo when the zoo can no longer afford food for the animals in their care.<br />One day, more or less on a whim, Victor drops off one of his stories at a newspaper.  This leads to a job essentially creating a \\"morgue\\" file--obits on persons of note not yet dead.  Except, in short order, Victors subjects begin to experience an extreme rise in mortality rates.  Eventually Victor cotton's on to the fact this is not a natural phenomenon--and the source of the phenomenon may well have Victor himself in his sights.<br />The book is patently absurd.  However, Kurkov makes masterful work of converting the absurd to the plausible.  He utilizes several artifices to accomplish this.  One is the presence of Misha, the penguin.  The notion of a flat holder in Kiev catering to a pet penguin is presented right off the bat in such a way that the outlandish concept seems plausible--and, thusly, Kurkov has established a precedent for acceptance of the outlandish within the context of the story.  There is also the exotic (to westerners, anyway) aspects of the locale ands society that Victor inhabits.  Really, how many people could locate Kiev on a map if their life depended on it?  Yet, we know Kiev is a real place.  The mixture of a fact with a created fiction allows Kurkov to create a realm wherein the fantastical seems rational.  Kurkov, finally, inserts some subtlety in the form of the malevolent forces arrayed against Victor and his subjects.  There is nothing specifically violent or dramatic in the way Kurkov introduces and maintains these forces into the story, yet they are there, are perceived as real.  This create a deterministic focus on the part of the reader, giving the sense of looking outside the context of the immediate scene in the story, thus muting the fantastical elements residing there.<br />The overall result is of an modestly engaging and affecting story that never quite lives up to the potential of its characters, yet stays on with one well after the book has been finished.<br />I wouldn't say this is a book the average reader would enjoy, but for those who like an occasional dive into the more exotic, Death and the Penguin will be a tasty little treat.	2002-10-29

Hollywoodization has, over the years, portrayed many a violent criminal as either some sort of romanticized \\"Robin Hood\\" or a misunderstood rebel against some evil social ailment that could only be addressed through violence.<br />T. J. Stiles takes on one such apparition in Jesse James in his vivid interpretive biography of James, Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War.  The James Stiles depicts is one that Hollywood would avoid like the plague-a racist, violent criminal bigot who was still fighting the cause of Southern Slavery 20 years after the Civil War had ended.  <br />The James depicted here is a truly loathsome and vile creature.  Very much a creature of  the malignant social mania that surrounded the institution of slavery (6 in the James house hold alone), James' short violent existence was not so much pure banditry nor rebellion as much as it was a terroristic guerrilla action aimed at prolonging a long dead cause.  Even if one were to write off much of his more horrendous beliefs as merely an inevitable byproduct of his experience and times any sympathy one might have for the man quickly dissipates as one comes to understand that his reactionary and impulsive character and his incredible predilection for reactionary mayhem are so instilled in him as to be atavistic in nature.  Foe example, he is depicted as \\"mistakenly\\" murdering several people simply because he couldn't pause to see who it really was he was killing.<br />The book is as interesting as a portrait of the struggles and hazards of living in the Missouri \\"border zone\\" that encompassed the more robust passions of both the pro-slavery and abolitionist movements indigenous to the South and the North and the social upheaval-and the attendant social violence-which such upheaval engendered.<br />This is a great book.  It's not a pleasant read-the subject matter all but obviates any chance for that-but it is a brilliant historical presentation which provides one with the frank, unvarnished truthsbehind the aftereffects of he Civil War the incredible human toll that conflict caused long after the formal engagement had been decided.	2002-10-29
US	53013845	R31C4FMTXIVRG9	0375726403	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	5	7	8	N	N	This is a truly awsome book.	Richard Russo has evolved into our greatest living American novelist because his books speak to a deep human longing for stories.  He writes the kinds of books that you simply cannot put down. Russo's books are compulsively readable.  He writes very big books that that read like small books. You keep telling yourself as you read \\"just one more chapter\\" only to reach its end and be driven on, \\"just one more.\\" Soon you've read roughly 500 pages and realize you haven't slept in two days.<br />Russo is a master at weaving a portrait of blighted small-town life, his aim is much deeper-especially in this novel as compared to earlier works.  \\"Empire Falls,\\" like Russo's earlier novels, is about a small-town blue-collar world, where people are left trying to make a life out of just getting by. \\"Empire Falls\\" Is not nearly as funny as his last book, \\"The Straight Man\\" (which page for page may well beat \\"Catch-22\\" for laughs and manic intensity), or as idiosyncratic as, say, \\"Risk Pool\\" or \\"Nobody's Fool\\" but \\"Empire Falls\\"  penetrates deeper than any of Russo's previous novels. <br />Miles Roby is at the heart of this intricately told tale. Miles is a genuinely good guy, too good, at times, for his own good. Miles left college after his second year to care for his ailing mother, but never returned. Against everything she wanted for him he remained in Empire Falls, ultimately running the Empire Grill -- a greasy spoon that serves as a window into life in the town. His main goal at this point it to do for his daughter what his mother wasn't able to convince him to do-get out of town in one piece to create a new future elsewhere, beyond the overwhelming, entrapping influence of Empire Falls.<br />The characters that move in and out of the Empire Grill are reminiscent of Russo's earlier characters, especially the ne'er-do-well but amusing father, a staple of his fiction. The troubles, hopes, and joys are those of small town life, by turns hilarious, disappointing, and downrightsad.  This is far and away Russo's best piece from an ensemble point of view-all of the secondry characters benefit from extraordinarily rich character development and, obviously, were drawn with real affection and feeling on Russo's part.<br />Miles is living a dutiful life that is not of his own choosing. Busy being the good son, brother, husband, father, employee and friend, Miles' life has ineluctably been driven on by other people's demands, even by their hopes and dreams. It's not just the bittersweet recognition that life doesn't turn out as we imagine it; it's that Miles can't quite remember what he once imagined, what his longings once were.<br />Russo's story, dipping into the past to illuminate the present, is Miles' search for the truth writ small -- in the details of his own life, in the history of Empire Falls, in his own wry, intricate, often hilarious musings about his life in particular on Empire Falls in general. It is truth on a small scale, which is the kind of truth in the end that matters most to us as individuals. It shapes our lives and gives them meaning.<br />Russo shows us a world where the good guys don't always win, where the petty slights of life reek destruction in cruelty and meanness. It's a palpable reminder that we are capable of evil. But it is just as surely a reminder that we are capable of goodness. In Russo's able hands, the achingly personal becomes deft social commentary. That's an all the more astonishing achievement, because it reads, purely and simply, like a good story.<br />This is a  truly awesome book.	2002-10-04

She talked me into coming in to read to her class--any book(s)I wanted to bring with me.<br />My reading gig is coming up this week so this past weekend I asked my 16 year old daughter to go through her old children's books (she has 50-60 of her old favorites still on a bookshelf in her room) and she emerged with 2 or three books for the kid's but also with Goodnight Moon--which she wanted me to read to her.<br />As Miss Zoe was growing up we'd read every night and Zoe (my daughter) got to choose what we read. She'd usually pick 2 to 3 books and, for years and years, Goodnight Moon was always one of them.<br />The book itself is somewhat inexplicable--mostly it's just a silly little poem, really--but for my kids it really struck a chord. All I know is that if your sixteen year old daughter wants to curl up on the couch and have you read one of her childhood books to her, that's quite a book.<br />I always give this to friends when they have a first baby, and I have always found that a few years later they are still telling me it is their kid's favorite book.<br />So don't try to figure it out, just buy it and read it to your kids.

A brilliant, explosive wonder, he appeared on the baseball scene of the mid-60's virtually without warning, dominated the game as no lefty ever had and, after a short, extraordinary brilliance, was gone in an instant, leaving behind a grateful, awed and largely befuddled multitude.<br />Koufax is an extremely private man.  He had no role in the preparation of this book.  However, Jane Leavy appears to have interviewed virtually everyone who ever knew or worked with Koufax to any significant degree and, through painstaking research has penned the definitive-though totally derivative-biography of Koufax we are likely to ever see.<br />Unfortunately-and this is no criticism of Leavy, just a reflection of the enigma that is Sandy Koufax-in the end the only truly salient fact that emerges is that Koufax remains as much a mystery today as he was in his prime.  Leavey may have conducted over 400 interviews and provided an avalanche of detail, background and speculation but the fact is that Koufax himself remains unavailable, unassailable and, in the final analysis, apparently unknowable.  One of his former teammates once observed that \\"Sandy Koufax is the most misunderstood man in all of baseball\\".  Leavy has, through this entertaining and valiant effort, established that fact to be as true today as it was 35 years ago.	2002-09-23
US	53013845	R1E5ICNURPT1O	0895261901	148709607	Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News	Books	3	25	37	N	N	Interesting viewpoint,-but illogicaly flawed analysis.	I bought Bernard Goldberg\\"s Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News at an airport news stand between flights on a recent business trip. What caught my eye was a \\"blurb\\" prominently splashed across the front cover that read \\"'Bias' should be taken seriously.\\" And who was that quote from? Why that bastion of liberal tradition, the New York Times! How could anyone pass on that sort of irony?<br />This book is interesting, but logically it's a mess. <br />Take the whole \\"Flat Tax\\" flap that serves as the instigator of Goldberg's public feud with his bosses at CBS (he wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal about the reporting on this issue, provoking their ire towards him) which Goldberg chronicles in detail in this book. Goldberg asserts that CBS's reporting, specifically that of Eric Engberg, was critical of the notion in its entirety and therefore stands as a classic example of \\"liberal media bias\\". \\"There is absolutely no way\\", he writes \\" that Enberg or Rather would have aired a flat-tax story with that same contemptuous tone if Teddy Kennedy or Hillary Clinton had come up with the idea.\\" The clear implication is it was the media's liberal bias that colored that story-presumably with the express intent of harming the Republicans and aiding the Democrats in an election year. What Mr. Goldberg fails to communicate is that this piece came out during the primaries when it's proponent, Steve Forbs, was running against the presumed nominee, Bob Dole. If you go back and look at that election coverage in the winter and spring of 1996 you will see that all kinds of respectable Republicans-Including Dole, Newt Gingrich and others, were lambasting Forbes's economic plans from all sides. It was primarily Bob Dole-not the Democrats-who benefited from this coverage. <br />The basis for Goldberg's allegations, charges and whatnot in the book have two foundations. The first is his own fist hand experience. These provide interesting insights and much fodder for contemplation. However, even some of his own stories muddle his assertions. For example, one of Goldberg's consistent themes, often repeated throughout this book, is that journalists are so ideologically insular that they \\"can't even recognize their own bias\\". As evidence he tells the tale-and this is a central event in the book, oft mentioned throughout this text-- of a conversation with CBS News President Andrew Heyward in which the latter allegedly confessed to Goldberg that \\"of course there's liberal bias in the media\\" but tells Goldberg that \\"if you any of this, I'll deny it\\". Excuse me, how to you admit to something you are so insular you can't recognize? It's this sort of muddled logic that permeates this book.<br />The second is the often cited surveys that show a vast majority of journalists, when polled, identify themselves as Democrats. The implication is that all Democrats are liberal, virtually all journalists are democrats, therefore all journalists are liberal. There are two problems with this. The first is, based on my experience living in the south for much longer than I care to admit, is that there are plenty of hard-core conservatives in the Democratic Party. They aren't called \\"yellow dog\\" Democrats for nothing.<br />The other problem is that when you dig into these surveys they reveal journalists actually look a lot like a lot of middle America when specific issue surveys are included-a bit to the left on social issues, a bit to the right on economic and military issues. <br />Towards the end of the book Goldberg asserts that \\"Ratings are the reason television people (including journalists and their bosses-my addition, not a part of the direct quote) do everything they do\\". Gee, based on the rest of his book, I thought it was bias.<br />There's another nagging problem here. For a book that's supposedly the work of a crack investigative journalist, this tome is long on assertion and allegations and very short on objective analysis, data and evidence. Goldberg obviously genuinely believes in the concept of liberal media bias. He does precious little to actually document it in concrete ways.<br />Does the media have biases? Almost surely. Does this book offer any real, meaningful insight and analysis into the origins, workings and effects of that bias? Not really.	2002-09-07

Rose  is a complex yet riveting family saga and romantic novel. <br />It tells the tale of a family from Maine, primarily through the eyes and experiences of Miss Lindsey Briggs.  Lindsey is a vivacious and headstrong young woman who is standing up her fiancé at the alter as the novel opens to abandon the traditional life style and follow her heart and dreams by heading off to Nashville to try her hand at country music.<br />\\"Follow your heart\\" is pretty much the cornerstone of this novel and Lindsey's determination to do just that serves as the prism through which the twists and turns of this novel are reflected and refined.  For it is the will and determination to block out all but her dream that brings Lindsey success-and great pain and heartache, as in the process of \\"following her heart\\" she loses track of the fact that it's a world with many roads and that one's heart may be destines to travel more than one of them.<br />Heartache has certainly been a facet of the character of her family members and the choices they have made.  The whole middle section of the novel provides context for Lindsey's agony as she learns the truth about the previous experiences of the women in her family and the choices they have made and the heartache they have endured.<br />In the end Lindsey must decide whether her laser like focus on her dream is (as her country music mentor and long time family \\"friend\\", legendary country music performer Ben McBride wonders) Lindsey's greatest strength or her greatest weakness.<br />This is a richly constructed novel with an array of likeable and well-developed characters.  It is realistic in its approach to the striving and struggles of musicians on the make and working to fulfill a dream as well as to the Nashville music scene in general. Most importantly, it is an honest and engaging love story that revolves around what feels to be real people with real emotions-a rarity in this day of mass manufactured \\"romance\\" novels consisting of cardboard characters of contrived circumstances that exist merely to titillate the reader and make a buck rather than communicate anything about love or life.  <br />This is a novel that will move you and remind you of those bygone days when your own heart was so moved and so full of aching, longing and happiness at the same time.  In other words, this is what a romantic novel is supposed to be.	2002-08-19

Robert Prechter, Jr. was to the 1980's what Abby Joseph Cohen was to the 1990's-the market guru with the golden touch and the fanatical following.  <br />I was in investment banking from 1977 through 1987 and Prechter was everywhere.  His newsletter was the equivalent of \\"required reading\\".  He was quoted extensively.  He could-and did-move markets.  <br />He achieved his status through dogged, unabashed bullishness in the very early 80's and burnished his reputation further by correctly calling the top of the market cycle in mid 1986.  That's when the Midas touch deserted him-he hasn't been close to a correct call on the market since, having converted to a \\"doom and gloom\\" analyst and being a dogged bear throughout the 1990's.  His last book predicted this bear market-a bit early.  <br />Well, way early.  At the Crest of the Tidal Wave: A Forecast for the Great Bear Market was written in 1995.  He missed the mark by 7 years and a few trillion in market value but hey, whose counting?<br />Apparently not the people buying Conquer the Crash: You Can Survive and Prosper in a Deflationary Depression, Prechter's attempt to exploit his bearish credentials of the past decade and a half to reestablish his status as market guru extraordinaire (Ms. Cohen, having blown several major calls lately, has left the title open for the moment for the taking).<br />So, is Prechter back?  Is this the book that will keep you in the lead financially and save your fiscal bacon?<br />Probably not.<br />First of all, the likelihood we are entering a \\"depression\\" is highly doubtful.  The unemployment rate-normally the preeminent statistic for judging downturns and depressions-has averaged about  5.5% during the recession we now \\"enjoy\\"  By way of perspective, in the 1980's 5% unemployment was considered \\"full\\" employment.  The 1990's changed that perception drastically, but that doesn't change history, which shows the \\"normal\\" level of unemployment in the recessions of the last century averaged around 8.5% and the average unemployment levels of the Great Depression hovered around 30%.<br />Moreover, the Fed is expanding the money supply at an ample rate and gives every indication of being positioned to do whatever is needed to avoid a deflationary spiral.  Check out the inflation numbers for the past 24months.  Inflation at the wholesale level is up about ½% overall and retail inflation is up about 1%.  The absence of inflation is not the same as deflation folks.  We are not in a deflationary economy, we are in a disinflationary economy (that is, the rate inflation has decreased markedly-but not disappeared altogether.)<br />Having said all that, there are a few basic points of useful information in the book.  You don't have to be in a depression for a bear market to hurt a lot.  Cash is King right now.  Until the market hits bottom (look for the 60 day moving average of the S&amp;P to have moved 5% above its trough), being in stocks is overly risky.  Bonds are out.  Rates are at historic lows, so returns are lousy and, moreover, bond yields long term have no where to go but up, so investments in bonds made now will depreciate over time (bond prices fall as rates rise). <br />Historically, a recession in post war America lasts about two years insofar as getting the statistics (such as the previously mentioned 60 day moving average on the S&amp;P) back into a positive groove for equity investments.  So the best advice is to hold your fire, hold cash or cash equivalents, and get back to investing sensibly early next year.<br />Byu which time, I predict, Mr. Prechter will have once again faded into the netherworld disgraced market guru's inhabit.	2002-08-07

Andre Lang, when asked to review the work of one of his rivals, once observed, \\"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lampposts--for support rather than for illumination.\\"<br />This observation sums up in a nutshell one of the major premises of Bjorn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, wherein Mr. Lomborg analyzes-and in large part rejects-much of the statistical analysis used to \\"prove\\" the validity of many of the assumptions that support current \\"mainstream\\" environmental \\"science\\".<br />Thirty years ago, many smart people believed that, by now, the population explosion would have knocked the world into a catastrophic famine, killing hundreds of millions of people. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, predicted back then that by the year 2000 Japan would run out of food and an armada of famished Chinese would invade Russia. Needless to say, these predictions, like virtually all others made in that book, were wrong: although the number of humans on Earth has almost doubled since 1960, there are fewer hungry people now than there were four decades ago. Just eight percent of humankind now lives in nations with insufficient average calorie intakes; according to the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, that represents the lowest such percentage in human history. Moreover, recent U. N. reports suggest hallowed assumptions about the rates of world population growth appear to be highly questionable at the least.<br />Has Mr. Ehrlich's credibility and stature been adversely affected by the fact that developments have utterly failed to support his theories and projections? Not in the slightest! He's still considered an \\"expert\\" in this area by many!<br />That is why this is book is so important. <br />Using a rigidly objective statistical approach Mr. Lomborg examines the factual basis for a number of popularly accepted \\"Environmental Truths\\" and reaches, in some but not all cases, very different conclusions about the validity of many of the assumptions accepted as gospel within the environmental community. Mr. Lomborgs aim, as the subtitle to the book suggests, is not simply to disprove and bludgeon the environmental community. It is, rather, to provide some objective analysis with the goal of fostering an environment wherein actual debate over reality based facts can occur that could lead to actual development of measures that could provide meaningful, cost effective solutions to real, as opposed to assumed, problems.<br />In a world where the Paul Ehrlich's-and they are legion within the environmental community-can be so wrong, so often, for so long, the development of a skeptical view of the assumptions underlying much of what constitutes \\"environmental science\\" can only be a good thing. With The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, Mr. Lomborg has skillfully used logic and reason to jumpstart that process.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with Mr. Lomborg, this is a book anyone who is concerned with public environmental policy formation needs to read.	2002-08-01

The book serves as much as a philosophical treatise on healthy eating as a cookbook, and from that standpoint it's interesting and successful as both a resource and motivational statement.  However, the philosophizing takes up quite a bit of space and that results in a surprisingly small number of actual recopies.<br />That scarcity would be a problem if there were a lot of stinkers in the mix, but that is definitely not the case--this is very definitely a &quot;quality over quantity&quot; effort.  I gave this to my wife for her birthday early this year and we've tried quite a lot of the recipes, and all have been delicious.<br />Some caveats:  These are by and large recipes for the more sophisticated palate--don't expect to find a lot of things that children will like very much.  Quite a few of the recipes are time intensive.  Planning is essential.  One the more intricate offerings, plan to do them on the weekend or when you can take the time to do it right.  My personal advice is, when the authors have different visions of how to proceed (a common event here) go with Dr. Weil--Rosie tends to like thing on the blander side. Finally, this isn't really constructed to be a &quot;full meal&quot; cookbook.  While there are sections for all major meal sections, there isn't often tremendous harmony on a &quot;whole meal&quot; basis.  In other words, pick what of this work you want to use and work around it.<br />This is, essentially, a specialty cookbook.  Use it that way and you'll find it's a gem.	2002-07-08

Marcus Aurelius once wrote, \\"Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look there.\\"  A piece of advice that is long on sagacity and devoid of practical suggestions as to the mechanics of the process of looking well into oneself.<br />If mechanics is what you are after, Sacred Contracts: Awakening Your Divine Potential by Caroline Myss is your book.<br />Ms. Myss essentially takes a very wide-ranging and extraordinarily detailed vision of Jungian Archetypical analysis, sprinkled with an assortment of other standard psychological analytical paradigms and has constructed a very comprehensive tool for self-examination.  <br />Her philosophical motivation for this effort is a personal belief that every individual has a specific, inborn purpose-a Divine Contract with the Creator-in this life, which one is obligated to discover and pursue.<br />Whatever you think of the philosophical basis, the fact nevertheless remains that this book stands a marvelous tool for self-examination and personal discovery and understanding.  <br />The buyer is forewarned that to really use this book requires a pretty daunting commitment of time and energy-the book is chock full of exercises and assignments, most of which are very detailed and time consuming to undertake.  My recommendation is you take a long look at this prior to purchasing, as it will be money wasted if you aren't going to use the book the way it's designed, but, on the other hand, simple statements of fact as this don't really impress the potential reader with the demands and complexity of the text.<br />Whether or not you buy into the particular philosophical and spiritual orientation and predispositions of the author, the book is a useful and meaningful tool for introspection--a process so many of us want to engage in yet a process so many of us haven't a clue about in actuality, as so much we have been exposed to by preachers, teachers and others usually is moredictates on how to live our lives by other's precepts and beliefs rather than helping us to determine our own.	2002-07-08

You may currently think that big, oversize burger you will order at some point only costs 99cents.  Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser will change your mind about that. It details not only the \\"costs\\" associated with the lethal dose of fat and chemicals inside that burger, but also the human toll that producing that 99 cent burger entails, through the full \\"food chain\\" of the cattle, agriculture, fast food, and meat packing industries to your stomach.  It is not a pretty tale.<br />Schlosser vividly delineates the exploitation, the inhumanity and the cruelty that the producers and distributors of \\"fast food\\" engage in to keep that 99 cent burger cheap.  Everyone involved-a few fat cat owners of the process aside-pays a very dear price to provide you with that cheap, destructive meal.<br />The power of this book is not in how it makes you aware of just how bad that burger is for you-others have done that and most anyone who can think knows deep down that burger, fries and shake isn't a healthy choice.  The power of this tremendous expose is in how it illustrates just how bad that meal choice is for thousands of other people as well.  This is not so much an examination of food production or health issues as it is a tale of self-inflicted suffering.<br />A truly great book.	2002-07-04
US	53013845	RHBAT7SE6JD85	0140288481	828207438	Hunger	Books	4	4	6	N	N	An excellent debut effort.	I once attended a lecture on the immigrant experience in America and one of the speakers posited that the type of experience an immigrant family would have depended on which type of immigrant they were:  the sort who is running to something or the sort who is running away from something.<br />Both sorts populate Hunger: A Novella and Stories by Lan Samantha Chang.  And, if these stories are any basis to go by, they refute the premise of the lecturer I heard that one day.  The immigrant experience, as depicted by these stories, has little to do with what motivated the flight, and everything to do with the fact the immigrant is an island unto him/her self-a person who cannot be either a \\"citizen\\" of either whence they came or where they come to.  This alienation and anomie is exemplified through various aspects of hunger throughout the text-hunger for love, for the past, far acceptance, for independence, for personal and/or professional \\"success\\". <br />These stories, like Chang's prose, are contained and spare yet rich in emotion, symbolism and emotional intensity.   Through these few tales Chang is able to convey both a wide range of experience and attitude toward the immigrant experience as well as the psychological toll that such experience entails.<br />I have to admit that I have a predisposition towards appreciating oriental immigrant stories.  I enjoy the primary players in the genre, such as Amy Tan and Gish Jen.  Chang provides a nice counterpoint to their work as it is the polar opposite in terms of prose style and intensity-short, intense vignettes as opposed to richly textured, wide ranging more sedately paced prose.  Both styles work and both are enjoyable.  Chang may not be as accomplished as the others at this point, but this book provides strong evidence that she will be soon.<br />An excellent debut effort.	2002-06-25

Sophie's Masterpiece: A Spider's Tale , written by Eileen Spinelli and illustrated by Jane Dyer is one of the very best children's book I have ever read. <br />The story concerns a spider named Sophie.  Sophie doesn't just spin a web--she weaves extraordinary works of art.  Everyone who knows her is in awe of her talents.  <br />She strikes off on her own to a drab little boarding house where she takes up residence and weaves her wonderful webs--but none of the people there care for her webs--or for her, for that matter.  Except for a boarder who is expecting a child.  She welcomes Sophie into her room and as she knits clothes for the baby Sophie, now old and frail, weaves a special baby gift of her own.<br />Warm and touching without being maudlin, Sophie's Masterpiece is a kind and loving story with extraordinary illustrations the dazzle on their own yet blend perfectly with the tale.<br />I have given this book as a gift to many children and am told time after time that it soon ranks as those kids favorite book.<br />Sophie's Masterpiece is a masterpiece, indeed!	2002-06-13

Limoges, Louisiana is the kind of small town where everyone knows your name. And your business. And just exactly with whim you are conducting that business, no matter how clandestine you may wish to be as you go about it. Vangie Nepper finds her small town friends and neighbors know her business before she does. They know her husband Henry, the town's pharmacist, has something going with his soda girl. They know that her daughter, Olive, lies in the hospital, comatose and pregnant-though they have no idea who helped her get that way, a fact that arouses extreme frustration among the town gossips.<br />Life in Limoges in 1952 is orderly and wholesome--at least for appearances' sake. But as the story told by its citizens unfolds, life is hardly pious and sedate in Limoges. Adultery, wife-beating, false preaching, and of course gossip, color the town. <br />It is the gossip-and the less than wholesome activities that feed it-that keeps the pace of the story. The reader, like the good citizens of this sleepy town, yearns for more.   <br />This is a book that is a deeply textured and expertly woven tapestry of small town southern life. The characters are so splendidly defined, the reader wants to know all motivations, all nuances of the place from its inception to this very moment. <BR>Though more sexually explicit than I prefer, it is still a captivating story.  One eventually has to surrender the story, yet the recipes, contributions of each character which appear throughout the text, allow me to return to the richness of Limoges. The taste lingers, nearly as savory as the tale from which they emerge. <br />I cans see I have a joyous task ahead of me-reading all of West's other novels.  What greater tribute to an author than the fact that as soon as one finishes one of her books, one is immediately on the hunt for others?	2002-06-11

Noam Chomsky may be a world class linguist, but that doesn't make him any more qualified to address the aftermath of 9-11 than, say, the world's leading dog trainer or the world's best plumber.  That's not to say that his ideas and thoughts aren't valid or interesting, it's to say they are, in actually, no more informed than anyone else's and just as subject to personal predilections and prejudices as anyone else's, just like the plumbers or dog trainers would be.<br />Chomsky's predilections and prejudices are decidedly anti-American.  He believes that the US is a leading terrorist state.  His view of 9-11 events is thoroughly and pervasively colored and influenced by that world view.<br />It's not that he doesn't raise good questions-he does.  It's that his conclusions are based not so much on objective fact or thoughtful consideration of the situation as they are the inevitable logical extension of his radical political orientation and beliefs.<br />Chomsky asks:  Did America's policies and behavior create the coditions that gave rise to 9-11? Chomsky's answer:  America is solely responsible.  In what way?  Chomsky's response:  In every way!  America is evil, evil evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />In part, no doubt America's policies and behavior did help create the events of 9-11.  Hoiwever, I don't buy into the \\"America-love it or leave it!\\" mentality, but neither do I buy into the \\"America is evil incarnate\\" mentality.  Unfortunately, it seems that all 9-11 material to date originates solely from one of the above enumerated points of view.  What's really needed is a thorough, thoughtful, objective, historically and politically researched and-most of all--balanced analysis.<br />This isn't even close on any of those counts.	2002-06-03

The message of this book, delivered in a smug, contented sneer, is that the chickens have come home to roost.  <br />Thousands of American civilians apparently deserved to die at the hands of the likes of Timothy McVeigh and Osama Bin Laden because the U.S. brings nothing but grief and pain to its own citizens and to all foreigners, everywhere, all the time.  September 11th is an example of the applications of Newton's Laws of Physics applied to human history--the \\"inevitable reaction\\" of \\"extraordinary idealists\\" whose \\"excessive sense of justice\\" was provoked by the latest edition in the succession of \\"criminal juntas\\" that have, apparently, ruled the U.S. since Thomas Jefferson left the stage.<br />In other words, the U. S. is a criminal state that can do nothing more than terrorize it's own people and those of the \\"Global Empire\\" (whatever the heck that is) and we are getting what we deserve.  And, clearly, Vidal is joyfully amused by every minute of it.<br />Vidal makes some legitimate points about the errors and arrogance of American domestic policy and foreign policy-totally unbalanced by any suggestion there's also a positive side to our nation and its government.  But to suggest that people such as mcVeigh and Bin Laden are saints, acting from purely noble and pure motives, and a \\"Justified\\" in their actions because we are such bad guys is total garbage.<br />I don't buy into the \\"America-love it or leave it!\\" mentality, but neither do I buy into the \\"The U.S. is evil incarnate and deserves everything it gets\\" mentality either.  Apparently, however, Gore Vidal does.  In the end, he merely demonstrates that intellectualism can on occasion merely lead idiocy of a very high order.	2002-06-03

The Nanny Diaries: A Novel by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus takes a look at the &quot;Nanny&quot; experience from the viewpoint ofunbiased professional experience.  <br />Being a Nanny for McLaughlin and Kraus is a job-not a glorified Marry Poppins replay.  It's clear they took it seriously.  It's also clear they fully understand the various dynamics that make the job so difficult.  There's the parents reaction to the arrangement, which will be distinctly characterized by why they hire someone in the first place.  Do they want a surrogate mother?  Or just someone to help out where they have time constraints?  Do they view their caregiver as a professional or just a grown up tennager?  Are they relieved or guilty to be entering into this sort or arrangement?<br />McLaughlin and Kraus give it to us straight.  The job is a window into a family's life.  As such, it has the cadence of family life--funny and sad at turns, tedious and stressful at turns, fulfilling anf frustrating at turns.<br />McLaughlin and Kraus have a brisk and engaging writing style that does indeed grab your attention and keep it. However, it's also true that the book is riddled with the usual problems one would see with a collaborative as well as a debut effort--uneven emotional pitch, hery-jerky writing on occasion and, at times, seperate writing voices.  These are blemishes, however, and while at time distracting, they don't ever truly disrupt the flow of things.<br />In the end the book is more about the experience than the meaning of the job--a bit of a disappointment.  It is an engaging read, however, and well worth the effort.	2002-05-23
US	53013845	R1LBR79TRBUKX5	0312130279	84547640	The Bird Artist: A Novel	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Norman is the master of the "anti-mystery".	Howard Norman writes what I think of as anti-mysteries.  It is his trademark to announce the \\"crime' that forms the basis for his story right up front.  So, Norman's novels tend to start with confession and work their way toward explanation (as opposed to a standard mystery, which moves toward a solution.). In The Museum Guard the crime is theft; in his newest, The Haunting of L., it is adultery, then murder. This book begins thusly:<br />My name is Fabian Vas. I live in Witless Bay, Newfoundland. You would not have heard of me. Obscurity is not necessarily failure, though; I am a bird artist, and have more or less made a living at it. Yet I murdered the lighthouse keeper, Botho August, and that is an equal part of how I think of myself.<BR>This novel is characterized by a dry humor, unlikely but truly engaging characters, and the skill with which Norman fixes them in their community and landscape.<br />As he recounts the story to the reader, Fabian, despite knowing where he is headed, even what he will see when he arrives, remains at the mercy of the stubborn swells of memories that preoccupy him along the way. And that, it seems, is the great mystery at the heart of Norman's anti-mysteries. Not what will or did happen, but what role the narrator actually played in everything and why it all seems to have so little to do with him. Norman's befuddled narrator/protagonists, with their confessional introductions, imply that everything they are describing is, in fact, being made sense of in the retelling, that the reader, therefore, is witnessing their very synthesis into a story. <br />Although critics have celebrated The Bird Artist as a tale of \\"redemption by art,\\" the novel seems skeptical about the idea. For one thing, meaningful redemption requires guilt, and Fabian feels none (nor is the reader shown any reason that he should, a fact that may bother some).<br />There is a big difference, though, between reckoning and redemption. Fabian's \\"redemption\\" for Botho'smurder is the fantastical mural of Witless Bay he is paid to paint near the end of the novel, above the pulpit of the church. The offer, from Reverend Sillet, is tendered with a mix of prurience and sanctimonious sadism-he throws in extra money for a depiction of the murder. Indeed, Fabian's show of contrition seems to be mostly for Sillet's benefit, and Margaret rightly mocks his shameless decision to paint himself into the mural, facedown in the mud in the place of Botho. But if the mural does not offer redemption, it does offer something like revelation. For the first time in the novel, Fabian steps back from the enveloping current of events, fixes them in relationships, and imposes his own organizing vision on them. What Fabian's art does offer are these moments of clarity, the knowledge that, in the end, Botho's murder is simply \\"an equal part of how I think of myself.\\"<br />For, in the end, it seems to me it is not so much redemption Fabian seeks, but understanding.  Which is a scenario much more true to the realities of everyday life than is the struggle for redemption in my view.<BR>A complex, challenging and rewarding read.	2002-05-11

I've read dozens of articles that have referred to this text and seen that this tome has been on the various bestseller lists forever, so I finally broke down and got a copy.  I have to admit I was very skeptical about it as I found the One Minute Manager, the precursor to this effort, to behave the all time worst hype-to-substance ratio I'd ever seen.<br />This book ranks right up there on that score as well.  If this is what passes as profound in today's world, then we are all in serious trouble.<br />This book is a very short missive supposedly dealing with change. The \\"book\\" part is about 30 pages, stretched into 94 pages by using very large print, leaving lots of blank space on virtually every page and using lots of uninspired pictures.<br />Essentially, in Who Moved My Cheese? An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life, Spencer Johnson, Kenneth H. Blanchard use a fable about two mice (Scurry and Sniff) and two little people (Hem and Haw) who live in a maze.<br />All four are used to getting a regular supply of cheese at a particular location within the maze. Then, one day, the \\"givers of the cheese\\" change the location of the food. The two mice adjust to the change quickly, immediately moving away to look for the new location of the food. Hem and Haw react very differently; they get mad, feel that they deserve the cheese, don't want to search for new cheese and generally \\"hem and haw\\" about how unfair life is.<br />This is as sophisticated as this thing gets.  While the title promises An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life all it really does is delineate the reactions of many people in the workplace to change.  There is nothing of value or substance in here that would actually help anyone cope with the phenomenon of change in the workplace, or anywhere else.<BR>This entire tome can be summed up in two sentences, as follows:<BR>Change is an inevitable force that affects each individuals life.  We must find way tocope with this force.<br />There!  I've just saved you the price of this book!	2002-05-10

I pretty much avoid the purely celebrity subject books but Rosie O'Donnel's such a unique personality that I made an exception.  Her crusades, her honesty, her passion and her openness all work to create a special buzz about the woman and I have to admit I was interested in seeing how her worldview developed and something about her early life.<br />Rosie O'Donnel is all about making points.  So it was no surprise as she began flogging her book that she made a distinct point about how this book was not about her sex life.  That is certainly true.  The problem is, it's not really about anything else, either. After reading this book, I'm still clueless about her early life or how her worldview developed..  Reading this book did precious little to inform or edify about Rosie the person.<br />This is a very frustrating book.  While the fact Rosie was abused as a child is well known, and, presumably, those experiences would be informative as to how her personality and politics developed, the whose issues is summed up in this sentence:  \\"I was an abused child\\".  That's it!  A dozen pages are dedicated to her tattoos and love for arts and crafts, but her child abuse gets one very short sentence? It's absurd.<br />There are some genuinely interesting sections.  When Rosie writes about her mother, the book is truly moving.  Yet, these sections are also frustrating.  That Rosie deeply loved her mother is clear. How her mother influenced and shaped her is in complete absence.  As for her father, his shortcomings are noted.  Period.<br />There's a lot about the problems she had in various relationships but nothing really about what those relationships meant to her or how they formed her ways of viewing the world and her fellow beings. There's a ton on her crusade for adoption, but again, that's all abut adoption and not about Rosie.<br />In the end one is left with no sense for the woman at all beyond that which casual attendance upon her TV show would convey.  <br />Note to Rosie:  no one else can \\"find you\\" till you find yourself!	2002-05-06

Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom by A. L. Haskett is a wild, dark, poignant and vastly entertaining \\"black\\" comedy set largely in modern day Los Angeles.<br />As the novel opens Duncan is living on his mom's ranch outside Cheyenne, Wyoming.  He does a bit of field and maintenance work around the ranch, but his key interest is painting-he does hackneyed cowboy and Indian scenes on black velvet to sell by the roadside to tourists.  <br />On one fateful day he sends his buddy Ben Lonetree out to peddle a real painting of Ben's family. In Ben's absence, Duncan's domineering mother (his dad died years ago in a freak accident) gives him an ultimatum Duncan is loath to acquiesce to. When ben returns with $600 for the family painting and the address of the buyer in LA who wants to see more of his work, Duncan is off to the left coast.<br />There he gets involved with a zany and colorful bunch of characters-an artsy crowd, a couple of motorcycle gangs, the denizens of a strip club by his apartment, and so on.  He falls for one of the strippers, whose affections he must compete for with a \\"butch\\" lesbian motorcycle mama.<br />When both Ben and Duncan's mom arrive on the scene to weigh in on Duncan's departure from Wyoming and his current situation, the sparks really begin to fly.<br />The action is fast, furious-and funny as all get out. The characters are lively and engaging.  Duncan himself is portrayed perfectly, though the angst and anomie of his beloved-Pris-is a bit overdone.<br /> Duncan's confusion and angst is occasionally relieved by dream visits from his dad.  These visits act as precursors to action ahead as well as act as a device to illuminate Duncan's character and worldview.<br />The book as a whole is very reminiscent of Christopher Moore's writing style-bright, vivid characters, wacky action, a bit of the phenomenological-and funny and entertaining as all get out.<br />My only real criticism is the editing-there are more typos and misspellings and grammar lapses in this text than in 100 other books you could choose at random.  Doesn't anyone associated with this effort own some sort of spell-check?<br />That nit-pick aside, this is a wonderfully engaging story that would make perfect plane and/or beach reading.

I truly love Kingsolver's writing-the Bean Trees is one of my all time favorite books-- and wish I could give this effort a good review-but I can't.  Wading through this series of essays is like prospecting for gold-you will fine a few brilliant nuggets after sifting through a lot of muck. <br />The problem I think is one of connection.  Ms. Kingsolver's talent has blessed her with the wherewithal to live a Henry David Thoreau sort of existence.  Idyllic as that may seem-and don't a lot of us wish we could live that way also?-that's not the way the world works.  The average two-income family with 4 kids and a dog may yearn for the tranquility of  a Walden but has to settle, unlike Ms. Kingsolver, for fast food and the grocery store.  In too many of these essays Ms. Kingsolver comes across a lot like the feudal lord who thinks the peasants should lighten up and have a bit more fun.  The lord would no doubt be surprised that his peasants don't work 18 hour days because they like it, but because that's what it takes to get by.<br />Kingslover advocates a lifestyle that's a choice for her but not an option for most.  Her essays preaching the benefits of this lifestyle therefore come across as preachy and somewhat naive.  One is left to wonder how someone who can so elegantly imagine the travails of common folks in her fiction can be so oblivious to them in real life.<br />However, when Kingsolver turns to observation and more personal topics, the book shines brilliantly like her novels.  \\"Lily's Chickens\\",  \\"A fist in the Eye of God\\", \\"The One-Eyed Monster, and Why I don't Let Him In\\" and, most especially \\"Letter to my Mother\\" are breathtakingly marvelous stories.<br />In the end I was left with the feeling that had Ms. Kingsolver simply allowed herself to write about life as she sees it rather than try to tell us how to live it, this would have been an infinitely better book.	2002-04-30

Books	3	10	20	N	N	Far less than it could-and should-have been.	Herencia : The Anthology of Hispanic Literature of the United States by Nicolas Kanellos (Editor), is a book that's been creating a lot of buzz here in San Antonio (where I live), a town that is one of the centers of &quot;Hispanic&quot; literature.  The buzz has been overwhelmingly negative, the primary thrust of the discussions being that this book is a &quot;political&quot; book and a &quot;sellout&quot;.<br />The book does have some serious problems.  First of all, this is not an anthology of \\"Hispanic\\" authors per se--calling it an anthology of \\"Latino\\" authors would have been more accurate.  You'd think the guru's at an institution as prestigious and knowledgeable as the Oxford University Press would understand that entities other than the Spanish colonized the southern Americas.  If this was intended to be a collection of \\"Hispanic\\" literature, several included authors should have been excluded.<br />As it is, excluding authors didn't seem to be an issue.  A list of major \\"Hispanic\\" authors whose work does not appear-or even get passing mention-here would fill a much larger collection than this.  Such a list would include major literary award recipients such as Kathleen Acala, Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros, as well as other, extremely well known and thought of artists as Julia Alvarez, Jose Antonio Burciaga, Alam Luz Villanueva, Denise Chavez, Gary Soto, Angela de Hoyos, John Phillip Santos, Juan Philipe Herrera, Arturo Islas and Cecile Pineda, to literally just name a few.<br />The word around here is that this is a \\"political\\" book in the politics os publishing sense.  Mr. Kanellos is apparently know quite well in the Latino writing community as a man who helps those he like and attacks those he does not-apparently quite a list based on the omissions from this text.  That sounds like pettiness at first blush-but when one looks at the way this book is constructed, one has to wonder.<br />Even with all that, the book is an impressive collection of works.that cover a wide range of Latio heritage (the translation of the title) and writing styles.<br />In the end, this stands not as \\"the\\" anthology of the (rather arrogant) title, but \\"an\\" anthology of \\"Latino\\" writers that is seriously flawed, but nevertheless stands as an impressive collection all the same.	2002-04-29

Baseball: A Literary Anthology edited by Nicholas Dawidoff and published by The Library of America offers a lively mix of stories, memoirs, poems, news reports, and insider accounts about all aspects of the great American game, from its pastoral nineteenth-century beginnings to its apotheosis as the undisputed national pastime. <br />Among the contributions are the works of Ring Lardner, Don DeLillo, sportswriters Damon Runyon & Red Smith, and poets William Carlos Williams & Yusef Komunyakaa.  Included are essays and player profiles from John Updike, Gay Talese, Roger Angell, and David Remnick. <br />Baseball: A Literary Anthology is a varied and exuberant display of what baseball has meant to American writers. Among the highlights: Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play Negro League ball; Stephen King follows his son's team on their riveting journey toward a Little League championship. <br />Bringing together tales of ambition and heartbreak, childlike wonder and implacable disappointment, raw strength and even rawer emotion, Baseball: A Literary Anthology tells a rich and vital story about the sport that has always been more than just a game in the hearts of Americans.<br />In an age where venal, shorsighted men seem bent on destroying the game, reading this book gives one perspective:  Such men have always existed--and failed.  This stands, then, as a book of remembrance, reflection and hope.  It's just what baseball-and baseball fans-need.<br />This is a truly great read!	2002-04-28

In a saga that covers 30 some-odd novels, some will be better than others.  This is not one of the better chapters in this series.<br />In this book, Spenser is hired by the leggy redhead attorney, Rita Fiore, one of the semi-regular repeat characters that populate this series, to determine out who killed Nathan Smith. Nathan was an upper crust banker with an impeccable reputation in Boston. He was killed in his bed--allegedly while his much younger wife, Mary, was watching television in another part of their three-story home.<br />Rita's not sure if her client is guilty or not.  Neither is Spenser, who concludes that Mary is either the densest broad or one of the better-unknown actresses on the 7 continents.<br />In typical Parker fashion, an inept attempt is made to put Spenser off the case.  When that backfires, the bodies start to fall, and a full fledged cover-up is underway.<br />The book has several flaws atypical of a Spenser novel.  Susan, Spenser's squeeze, is self-flagellating over the death of a gay client.  That Susan has a side issue is nothing new-but this one is unnecessarily obtrusive and distracting from the story.  Spenser himself is projected as rather bland in this story-the famous wise cracking and internal musings are almost entirely absent.  Hawk is but a bit player here--one wonders why Parker included him at all.  And the ending is obscure and evasive.  I read the book and am still unclear exactly who the killer actually was.<br />I'm disappointed but not despondent.  Parker has slipped before only to come roaring back.  Hopefully, that will be the case this time as well.	2002-04-28

Glen David Gold's Carter Beats the Devil is a wonderful, rollicking, addictive old-fashioned adventure story.<br />Set in the early 1920's, the story revolves around Charles Carter-master magician and illusionist.  The book opens onto one of Carter's shows, one in which President Harding is an observer and a participant.  Harding dies that night. Following the show.  The secret service believes Carter played a role in the President's death. <br />The book is a wonderful character study filled with interesting, eccentric characters-both fictional and historical.  It is a fine piece of period historical fiction of late 19th and early 20th Century San Francisco.  It has wonderful detail about magic and magicians-both fictional and historical, including some of the greats of the early 20th century, like Houdini and Thurston.  It is a novel of suspense and intrigue.<br />In short-this is a deep, rich narrative that works very, very well on many levels.  I frankly became engrossed in it and found it a very hard book to put down.<br />This is a great story that is well written and very engaging. If you love great stories, this is your book!<br /> I hope that Gold has many more such tales \\"up his sleeve\\" (so to speak)!	2002-04-23

People who try to write books about physics or other (to the layman, anyway) arcane topics have a problem:  How do you make complex topics best described mathematically accessible to the math adverse layman?<br />Hawking tackles that challenge in The Universe in a Nutshell.  Through simplified text, lots of nifty illustrations, and a prose style that focuses on a short, quick hitting, modular sort of presentation style, Hawking attempts to render the complex and often obscure notions of cosmology and physics simply enough for the interested but uninitiated reader to comprehend.<br />On the whole, he succeeds rather well.  There are the inevitable sections where the translation from math to verbiage fails to make the transition well, but for the most part the accompanying illustrations will get the reader through to an understanding of the primary point, if not the fine points, of the discussion.<br />A lot has been written in prior reviews comparing this to A Brief History of Time.  The comparison is fatuous.  These books are aimed at different markets-the prior at the more sophisticated and initiated reader, this at the less sophisticated, less initiated reader.  They aren't comparable works-one is intended to be simpler, more basic, than the other.  That it is does not render it a \\"inferior\\" work.  Personally, I think Hawking deserves credit for genuinely trying to provide all level of interested reader an access point to these ideas and concepts.<br />If you are a more enlightened sort about these topics, skip this book-you probably won't learn anything new.  If you think \\"string theory\\" explains why those tin-can-with-string \\"phones\\" we played with as kids work, then this is probably the book for you!	2002-04-22

Unlike the more recent \\"biography\\" books about Martha Stewart (see Jerry Oppenheimar's Just Deserts), this isn't simple an exploitative, mean spirited hatchet job.  In Martha Inc.: The Incredible Story of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Christopher M. Byron makes an effort to be at least somewhat balanced about the lady.  True, he does dwell on the negatives, but at least some positives are considered.<br />What seems clear is that Ms. Stewart is no longer a pleasant middle class housewife-is this really so surprising?  The woman leads the largest Woman run media empire in America.  When would she have time to be average anything?<br />And, since when are corporate titans nice guys?  Michael Eisner at Disney may project warm fuzzies out the wazzou on camera-it's clear from what's been writtten it's s different story when the camera is pointed elsewhere.  Is that OK for a man nut unacceptable for a woman? Puh-leeeeease!<br />Of course, it's starting to become clear that Ms. Martha may never have been pleasant, even when she undeniably was a middle class house wife.  There appears to be a mean streak there that is congenital-maybe that's what you need to be like to make it to the top, but it's not necessarily a hatchet job when you point out the truth.<br />And what is the truth according to Byron?  That Martha is a very successful gal-bydint of very hard and ceaseless work.  That such hard work took a major toll on her private life (Gee, another surprise, eh?) and some of those left behind don't remember her fondly.<br />The truth also is that Martha saw-and exploited-the available synergies between print, media and internet well before anyone else did-and has done so at a level few others have approached(Looked at the value-using that word loosely-of AOL/Time Warner stock lately?  Where has integrated media gotten them?)  In other words, the woman was a visionary, something Byron makes clear.<br />The writing is OK-nothing special.  And the balance-while better then most-still is lacking.  But this is probably the best look at Martha out there, and is probably more honest and balalced than her own planned memoir will be.<br />If you're interested in Martha, this is the book to read.	2002-04-22

In The Baby Boon : How Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless Elinor Burkett continues what apparently was the major sport of the `90's-portraying oneself as a victim of some sort of social policy or social trend.  Here, Burkett-in a writing voice elegantly reminiscent of a whiny 6 year old-argues that the childless are in fact a discriminated against subset of the populace.<br />In point of fact, Burkett does raise some valid points and provide some interesting and compelling arguments for her case.  Clearly there are some ways I which those with children benefit from social policy.  The problem is that few working parent enjoy anything like the full smorgasbord of \\"benefits\\" Burkett is upset about.  To hear Burkett tell it, every parent everywhere has it easy/better/whatever than the childless over a huge range of perks/benefits/allowances.  Most people, in most jobs and circumstances, might enjoy one or two of these, but not much more.  These \\"benefits\\" are irregularly deployed and highly regional in nature.<br />Of course, there are ways the childless benefit from others having children.  Who is it all these bellyaching whiners think it is that will provide the wage taxes to pay their Social Security payments, for example?  It's the children of those who they are griping about.  However, not a single word about the benefits these other people provide the childless by having kids ever pops up in this text.<br />Moreover,  there is plenty of reason to believe that, insofar as companies do provide these benefits, they do so not to be nice to their \\"parent\\" employees but do so to further their own selfish interests-they provide these benefits to attract the quality and quantity of employees they need to further their corporate interests.<br />I'll give this 2 stars as a few valid points are made, but if you are looking for a fair and balanced examination of this topic, you won't get it here.	2002-04-21

Michael Connelly's Detective Hieronymous \\"Harry\\" Bosch is one of the few archetypical hard-boiled noir detectives in the Raymond Chandler mold to be found in today's mystery fiction.  The intensity with which Connelly has painted this character is truly a marvel of the genre. That he does so with such a clean and bright literary palette-there are no gimmicks, tricks or bizarre eccentricities used as literary devices here-is truly refreshing. <br />Bosch (for those new to him) is a L.A. homicide detective--a chain-smoking (OK, he quit, but you get the idea) loner, a tightlipped outsider who refuses to play by his superiors' rules and a man who takes each crime he's exposed to as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it.<br />If there is room for criticism of this series it's that, all too often, the plots Connelly constructs are inferior to the character-that's certainly been the case the last two outings.  That is not the case here.<br />In City of Bones the old bones of an abused, murdered child are uncovered in the hills of Laurel Canyon, Harry and partner Jerry Edgar are assigned the nearly impossible task of identifying the child and solving a murder committed 20 years ago. An orphan himself, Harry considers child abuse cases particularly difficult, but he finds some solace in the arms of Julia Brasher, an attractive recruit whom regulations say he shouldn't be seeing. As the investigation progresses, so does Harry's relationship with Julia until everything goes spectacularly wrong. <br />Of course, things going wrong are a hallmark of the Bosch series.  However, this riveting thriller is a departure from the norm.  This installment in the series finds Harry even more introspective than usual, and while the tight prose of the plot swirls around the mystery of the bones, Harry's turbulent life and career are changed forever in a stunning conclusion.<br />One is left to wonder where Harry-and Connelly-go fromhere.  That you, as the reader, are left really, really nervous about Harry's fate and prospects at the end of this book says a lot about what a wonderful creation Connelly has wrought with this series in general, and this installment in particular.<br />This is as good as it gets for the thriller/mystery fan!	2002-04-18
US	53013845	RRAHHZBKCMLU6	0743406117	302105199	Year Zero	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Long has dived a bit too far into the deep end in this one.	Jeff Long reminds me of Jonathan Lethem:  A truly gifted writer with a unique and highly developed imagination and a bit too little discipline and good sense.  The latter can allow a fertile imagination to run a bit too wild. <br />That is definitely the case there.  Year Zero : A Novel is essentially an apocalyptic novel in the tradition of Stephen King's The Stand.  A virulent, highly deadly microbe (which bears striking resemblance to Ebola) hidden since the first century is accidentally unleashed.  It is wiping out humankind.  The group gathered to deal with the situation is split on a response-either go hell bent for a cure or find human DNA from the first century and clone a resistant populace.<br />As serendipity would have it, a huge cache of 1st century bones was recently unearthed in an archeological expedition in the Middle ERst.  A r ready source of DNA is available.  All is well and good up to this point-a highly charged, well written, fast paced thriller with interesting moral issues is upon us.<br />Unfortunately at this point things get a bit too weird.  ...What are they after? Nothing less than the bones of Jesus.<br />Nathan joins up with the team gathered to deal with the situation and embarks on a task of his own-cloning Jesus.<br />It's an imaginative and interesting concept Long has developed here.  The problem is, it gets in the way of-and distorts the underlying story.  We now have two separate plot lines that don't synergize--they compete, and the result is both end up being less story than they should-and clearly could-- be.<br />There are also issues that are never really addressed.  Didn't Jesus ascend to heaven?  That issue is dealt with cavalierly here?  How did anyone survive the 1st century plague-and why isn't there some vivid historical record of it?  Again, a side bar issue seriously mishandled.  Granted, this is fantasy fiction, but some internal consistency would be nice.<br />In the end Long talent and pure drive keeps the bookreadable and holds things together enough to keep the reader absorbed.  It's not a bad novel-it's just that clearly there was a great novel here that got lost somewhere along the way.  And that's somewhat disappointing.	2002-04-18

Atonement is chiefly about a child, a little girl named Briony Tallis, who is at the age where she recognizes that the way she views the world is different than how adults view the world, and is desperately engaged in trying to understand why this is the way the world works. <br />A precocious child, Briony actively considers her own sense of reality: \\"was everyone else really as alive as she was? For example, did her sister really matter to herself, was she as valuable to herself as Briony was? Was being Cecilia just as vivid an affair as being Briony? Did her sister also have a real self concealed behind a breaking wave, and did she spend time thinking about it, with a finger held up to her face?\\" If the answer is yes, Briony thinks, then \\"the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone's thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone's claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was.\\" But if the answer is no, she thinks, then Briony \\"was surrounded by machines, intelligent and pleasant enough on the outside, but lacking the bright and private inside feeling she had.\\"<br />The novel opens as a house party is about to begin. Briony is about to discover that her sister Cecilia does indeed feel as \\"valuable to herself\\" as Briony does. Or, rather, Briony is about to ignore this truth, in a moment for which the rest of her life will be an atonement. <br />Staring out of the window, she sees Cecilia, her sister and Robbie, a young frioend of the family, standing by the large fountain. Suddenly, Cecilia, strips down to her underwear while Robbie watches her, and steps into the deep fountain to retrieve something. Cecilia emerges, puts her clothes back on, picks up a vase of flowers that had been hidden by the fountain, and walks into the house. Robbie also walks away. The scene stirs the little girl, who had once confessed her love to Robbie. She has the sense that she has witnessed someadult mystery, perhaps a scene of obscure...domination. Briony does not know what McEwan has told us, namely that Cecilia dipped into the fountain to retrieve a piece of the broken vase, and that Cecilia's provocative stripping had more to do with ...challenge than submission or fear. <BR> Unfortunately, misunderstanding the context as a child will, Briony proceeds to provide a series of adults with a version of event that land Robbie in jail.<br />The events pretty much ruin Cecilia and Robbbie's rather idyllic lives.  It is only later that Briony understands what it is she has wrought.<br />The book then shifts to the war.  Robbie is fighting, having volunteered to avoid prison.  Cecilia is a nurse.  Dunkirk is underway.  This section is by far the best in the book.  McEwan is normal the most controlled and concise of writers-spare, often, to an extreme.  This prose is the exact opposite of his norm.  Rich, expansive and deep, it is amount the best writing I've read in many a year.<br />The book ends with Briony an old woman with yet more changes in perception to deliver.  I know that's not precisely a very informative statement, but to say more is to seriously influence the reading experience.<br />This is, quite frankly, the best book I've read in years.  It's a truly spectacular achievement.	2002-04-11

I travel extensively and an author like Nelson Demille represents a priceless treasure to someone like me:  A can't miss author whose works will virtually always be available in an airport bookstore.  I've read all his book-every one bought is just such a location.<br />His latest effort, Up Country, is a sequel of sorts to his best known work, The General's Daughter.  Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner is brought out of retirement to investigate a possible 30 year old murder that allegedly occurred during the Tet Offensive.  <br />The novel is part travelogue and part suspense story.  The travelogue is the obvious nostalgia of a former Viet Nam War vet in a return engagement in his old digs.  Demille was in fact a Viet Nam veteran and one senses that this portion of the novel is in fact a travelogue of his own return put to novelistic purposes.  It is nonetheless fascinating both as to the actual scenery as well as to the current state of politics and society in Viet Nam today.<br />The suspense part is not quite up to Demille's best work but not far off that standard.  Faced with dangerous incidents in the urban landscape, Brenner, in the company of an attractive American businesswoman ostensibly sniffing out commercially viable opportunities, travel \\"up-country\\" seeking the instigator of the investigation, a North Vietnamese soldier who described the incident in a 30-year-old letter that has only recently come to light.<br />The book is long-700 or so pages, the travelogue portion adds some heft-but as is the usual with Demille, the pace is torrid and the book seems to sail along.<br />Demille is the master of the military thriller. This may not quite be up to his usual standards-particularly if the reader has no interest whatsoever in Viet Nam-- but he is so darn good at this genre that \\"not quite Demille's best\\" is still light years better than anyone else, and it's still an excellent read.	2002-04-10

Written between Hard-Boiled Wonderland and Dance, Dance, Dance, Norwegian Wood is a very different sort of novel for Murakami.  <br />Set in Tokyo and in a mountain sanatorium in the late sixties, it is, one suspects that this is a very autobiographical, Murakami's gentle protestations to the contrary notwithstanding.  This is the story of a college student, Toru Watanabe, trying to find himself, to grow up, to make a commitment to someone, and to be true to that commitment.<br />The choice of the song Norwegian Wood as a title is appropriate, especially regarding the song's little known subtitle (take a look at the Rubber Soul album and you'll see it), This bird has flown.<br />Watanabe once had (and was had by) two girls, one of whom is sliding slowly into complete mental disintegration, (this would be the bird that has flown) the other - feisty, independent, but as desperately lonely as Watanabe - lodging the claims of love, life, and a warm body against those of past pledges-pledges Watanabe views somewhat differently than the girl in question.<br /> ... First of all, this is an early effort-one would expect a bit of a shortfall in the sophistication department given Murakami's age when hr wrote it.  More importantly, however, is the subject matter.  This is a story of personal introspection about a romance-not about the alienation and anomie inherent to complex, inhumane, technocratic societies.  Of course the elements of style Murakami would impose on these two radically different subjects is different.<br />At it's core, this is a tale of loss.  Watanabe ends up losing his love in various ways and to various degrees throughout the book till she's finally totally gone in the end.  The book is about how Watanabe copes with these various elements of loss.<br />I can understand why some fans of this author would find the book disconcerting as it is well outside the typical structure of a Murakami novel and the effects of this departure, given the extraordinarilydistinct style Murakami normally utilizes, seem magnified over what would be expected from a more mainstream author.  Don't let such comments dissuade you from reading this novel.  I greatly admire Murakami's other work and liked this as well.  It's a book that can be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone willing to accept it for what it is rahten than impose their own expectations on it.	2002-04-07

The premise of this book is stated right out in the title.  What is the source of all of America's ills?  Moore insists that all society's ills are linked back to stupid white men.  Moore argues that it's greedy CEOs, politicians and those who support them who are responsible for all social ills-from poverty, our lousy educational, electoral and governmental systems to the Battle of the Sexes-everything has been screwed up by Stupid White Men.<br />Moore tackles these issues with sharp political intellect, dry humor and self-deprecation without sounding like a tired old liberal. In other words, he avoids coming off as an arrogant blowhard the way his ideological nemesis, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, did in his 1992 dissent &quot;The Way Things Ought to Be&quot; or (for the most part) as a dour, humorless brat like his political soul-mate, Ralph Nader did in his recent memoir of the 1992 presidential election, \\"Crashing the Party\\". (Although he does have his dour moments about the 1992 presidential election himself.  Come on folks, get over it!)<BR>Moore does offer solutions, but in a comical, peevish way.  His solution for remediation in the Battle of the Sexes?  Men should learn how a toilet seat works!<br />His approach in this book is fun, concise -- and, no doubt in the eyes of many beholders, true.  Personally, I think Moore plays the blame game a bit too much, but both his thesis and writing style are, in general, both resonant and humorous, though the book has it's tedious moments.<br />This book is going to offend some people.  If some leaders and/or opinion leaders had their way, Moore would be brought up on charges of treason for his critical remarks about the conservative agenda and the Bush administration. On the other hand, we need that to some degree.  We need folks like Moore-- a rabble-rouser who encourages national discourse in a time of intellectual and political conformity. Moore is not afraid to publish dissent when it's unpopular to doso. And there's nothing more patriotic and American than that.	2002-04-04

There's got to be a lot of folks out there like myself who at one point or another had some genuine interest in science as a topic but had that enthusiasm crushed by what passes for &quot;science education&quot; in our schools.  Between nerdy and boring teachers in middle and high school and science texts whose only real point seems to be rendering the reading of statutory tax law or specifications for sewer pipe manufacturing seem exciting.  People who were not necessarily destined to be scientists but who gladly would have dived into the subject had there been any incentive whatsoever to do so.<br />Well, you can dive in to Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements by John Emsley and plan to stay as long as you want.  This is science presented with the flair and wit that, if more widely employed, would make studying science a lot more palatable to many students.<br />Emsley is a respected science text writer, so he knows the subject inside out.  His aim here is to inform and entertain both.  The elements appear alphabetically.  Information encompasses the basics of the element's structure and abundance in the world, common uses, it's significance to human health and disease and the impact it has on our lives in general.  There's a closing &quot;Element of Surprise&quot; that covey's an interesting fact about the substance.<br />The essays are long enough to be informative and short enough to keep attention from wandering.  This is the sort of book you can either read right through or leave around and sample every now and then.<br />Overall, an excellent general guide and reference book students and their parent's can both enjoy and find useful.	2002-04-04

The Small Town usually looks-to those of us who usually only see them as we drive by/through their confines-like a stagnant, static environment where nothing much happens very slowly.  Richard Russo's unique gift is to show-with humor, insight and a healthy helping of pathos-the dynamic, often desperate nature of life as it is lived within the outwardly bucolic confines of the small town.<br />Small town scenes have always been fertile fictional ground.  Why?  They present manageable little pressure cookers with a fixed cast of characters, whose lack of privacy and enforced proximity may cause the plot to boil over.<br />Nobody's fool is Russo's third small town upstate New York tale after Mohawk and the extraordinary Risk Pool.  \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" is set in North Bath, N.Y., a fractionally less blighted version of the blue-collar dead end where his earlier novels, \\"Mohawk\\" and \\"The Risk Pool,\\" take place.<br />What's turned up the heat in North Bath is the possibility that a theme park, to be called the Ultimate Escape, may be built there, and may breathe some economic life into the moribund former spa. Once a thriving resort, the town has declined steadily since 1868, \\"when the unthinkable began to happen and the various mineral springs, one by one, without warning or apparent reason, began, like luck, to dry up, and with them the town's wealth and future.\\" <br />Donald Sullivan-Sully to the inhabitants of North Bath-is  the novel's incorrigible and engaging hero.  Says Russo in the  book:  \\"Throughout his life a case study underachiever, Sully -- people still remarked -- was nobody's fool, a phrase that Sully no doubt appreciated without ever sensing its literal application -- that at 60, he was divorced from his own wife, carrying on halfheartedly with another man's, estranged from his son, devoid of self-knowledge, badly crippled and virtually unemployable -- all of which he stubbornly confused with independence.\\"<br />Sixty years have knocked Sully from one partof North Bath to another, from his violent father's house to the rooms he rents now from the elderly Miss Beryl Peoples, his former teacher. A painful knee injury has him working odd jobs, off the books. <BR>Sully is a partly domesticated, slightly maddened bear, feinting and jabbing at the center of the book's many subplots and hard-luck characters. His estranged lover, Ruth, has a husband she despises and a daughter whose own husband is trying to kill her. Sully's son, Peter, has serious marital troubles, two difficult children, a crazily possessive mother, a sick stepfather -- and he's been denied tenure at the small college where he teaches. Miss Beryl has been getting lost on her excursions around town, and she is compelled to fend off the grabby, selfish meddling of her banker son, Clive Jr. -- one of the main boosters of the Ultimate Escape. Even Sully's best friend, Rub (he's too dim to find trouble to get into), is undone by his wife's late-blooming kleptomania. <br />As with all Russo's novels, knowing the outline of the story utterly fails to convey the complexities and emotional quagmires that the story involves.  These are deep textured, richly woven stories that Russo writes.  To read one of these books is more like to move into town-you are left with the sense that you're not reading this, you're living it.  This is definitely the case with Nobody's Fool.<br />I personally consider Russo one of our greatest living writers.  This book is classic Russo, the type of work that fully works to establish his exalted position.  <BR>This is not a novel to be missed.	2002-04-03

Hilarious	In the interests of full disclosure I must admit that I am something of an Amis fan.  I do understand, however, that Amis is a bit of an acquired taste.  There are some of his works that just aren't written to appeal to a mass market.  This is not one of those.<br />Far and away Amis' most accessible novel, Lucky Jim deals in comic catastrophe. The hapless Jim Dixon a newly employed assistant lecturer in history at a small British university, attempts to settle in and make a good impression. He encounters one disaster after another.  As events unfold, it's clear that Jim is anything but &quot;lucky&quot;.<br />Not the least of his problems is his eccentric boss Professor Welch, but also contributing are a madrigal gathering at Welch's house, Jim's infatuation with Welch's obnoxious son's girlfriend, not to mention the obnoxious son himself, little wars with the other tenants at his boarding house, and the necessity to deliver a showcase lecture on &quot;Merrie England.&quot;  This latter requirement provides the setting for one of the funniest academic spoof sequences in all of English literature.<br />The book was first published in 1954 and some of the language--presented as colloquial in the book, is a bit dated. This doesn't really detract from the story--it really just add a level of quaintness.  This is the only real criticism on can put forward, however.<br />This is satire of a high order as rendered by a master.  Recognized as one of the 100 best books of the 20th century by whatever group of highbrows it was that put that out in late 1999.  This is one that actually deserved to be on it.<br />Lucky Jim proves great literature need not be dull or depressing.  This is a truly great read.	2002-03-31
US	53013845	R3H63JX0LTFATL	0374525102	113803662	Annie John: A Novel	Books	4	21	25	N	N	A novel of adolescent alienation and familial separation.	Annie John tells the tale of a family's disintegration.  Told from the perspective of Annie, 10 when the novel starts and in young adulthood by its end, the story revolves around Annie's transformation from an adoring, obedient child to rebellious, hardheaded outcast within her own home.  It's a classic mother-daughter love-hate tale where balance is somehow lost and  animosity and divisiveness come to rule the day.<br />The story is rendered in a series of 8 chapters that effectively amount to a sequence of interrelated short stories each of which highlights and incident and/or event that stands as a critical turning point in the mother-daughter relationship.<br />The story is set in Antigua.  This, along with the prosaic quality of Annie's narrative voice, add an element of the exotic to the story.  It also provides the basis for the inflexible social structure that locks the combatants into rigid stances from which, ultimately, they cannot extricate themselves.<br />The book is well written and progresses in a stately and unrushed manner.  It's not the sort of book you pick up and can't put down.  In point of fact, I found I tended to put it down after every chapter-the short story effect lent itself to such a reading style and, as each chapter amounts to a major point in the story, that gave me a chance to assimilate and assess the story tot hat point.  I found the book intellectually stimulating but I can easily see how someone not really gripped by the story could call this work boring, as quite a few previous reviewers have.<br />On the whole I found it a unique and interesting reading experience that, in retrospect, ought to have been somewhat depressing, yet wasn't.<br />On the whole, an intriguing book.	2002-03-29

To be honest, this book's popularity amazes me.  I first read it when it came out in 1974-I was 21 and in college-and, despite the fact I liked the book a lot I couldn't fathom how it ever became a mass market success.  Here we are 28 years later and it's in the Top 1000 Amazon sellers.  Amazing.<br />Obviously, if you've read previous reviews, you realize this is a divisive book, seen as either revelatory or insipid.  <br />The book is heavily philosophical in tone, but at heart it's about finding your allegorical life device.  (Had the book been written 20 years later, we'd have used the term paradigm.)  For this character, it's motorcycle maintenance.  That's not particularly profound, but then, really, not much in life is when you get right down to it.<br />I think a big part of the problem is that people forget this is fiction Admittedly, it's heavily autobiographical and pretentious fiction, but fiction nonetheless.  This isn't Bertrand Russell or Kant or Martin Heidegger writing an academic tract meant to profoundly influence the world of philosophical thought.  Moreover, anyone who went to college must have somewhere along the line been exposed to a similar character-someone full of his own importance and questions and semi-educated the way undergrads are in philosophy, perpetually blowing his horn.<br />The other thing that never seems to get mentioned that is, to me, a key element that underlies and drives this story is that early on we learn the man has just gotten out of the loony bin having been subjected to electroshock therapy.  The man's brains have been artificially addled and he's trying to put things in some sort of order.  An allegorical device makes a lot of sense in this context.<br />On the whole this is an entertaining and thought provoking story-the way that, say, Ayn Rand wrote interesting, thought provoking, heavily allegorical yet somewhat unrealistic stories.<br />If you approach the book in that light, I can't see how you can help by enjoy it.	2002-03-29

An exercise in writing a novel \\"through the looking glass\\", Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World: A Novel by Haruki Murakami and translated from the Japanese by Alfred Birnbaum is a complex psychedelic ... schizophrenic novelistic odyssey.  <br />The text is essentially two stories that are, in many ways, mirror images of one another that play out in alternating chapters and which, over the course of the novel, slowly merge into a unified whole.<br />The two protagonists are characters that share may traits but are emotionally and intellectually polar opposites.  This is true also of the settings-the one a modern day cyberpunk thriller that seems to take place almost entirely in the tunnels beneath the streets of Tokyo, the other an ancient, walled city of unknown location.<br />The protagonists are complex and vividly drawn.  Yet, they both exist within a framework of incompleteness and there is the sense that beneath the frenetic aspects of the one story and the bucolic serenity of the other all their actions, to the extent they can dictate them or even understand them, are aimed at obtaining a unity they can sense yet don't understand.<br />This is a large, elegant risky undertaking on Murakami's part and the fact he brings it all off with such skill and aplomb speaks volumes about the depth of both  his talent and his imagination.<br />This is not your typical Murakami novel. Fans of his other books need to understand that this book reads like nothing else Murakami has produced.  Don't be put off, however. While this is not an easy read-it requires your attention and persistence-the effort is well rewarded.	2002-03-28

In Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha Roddy Doyle attempts--with some success-to see the way a child views, and understands, the world evolve and mature.  The book starts out with Paddy a feisty 10 year old and follows him through adolescence.  As Paddy grows up and starts to realize that there are real problems and issues out there that really do affect him and that he's got to come to terms with, the narration does an admirable job of maturing along with the boy.<br />The problem for me, as it appears to be for many to others who have commented on this book, was that I never engaged with the story on an emotional level.  The story never grabs you and sucks you in.  Reading this is sort of like having an out-of-body experience-you see it all, understand it all, but never develop any sort of feelings about the enterprise.  <br />The writing style is interesting, the story moves along, there are some interesting insights.  Unfortunately, this appears to be one of those books where the whole seems somehow to add up to less than the sum of it's parts.  In the end you are left with a book you can appreciate but for which you have no particular fondness.	2002-03-28

Henry Kissinger once observed that &quot;The reason academic infighting is so fierce is that the stakes are so small.&quot;  <br />That sentiment seems to be the departure point for Richard Russo in his spoof of the life of a tenured professor in the midst of a middle age crisis in Straight Man.<br />This book is something of a departure for Russo.  His previous novels all revolve around blue collar life in economically stagnant northeaster backwaters.  While funny in their own right, the humor arises more form context and irony than outright comedic effect.<br />In Straight Man some of those elements are present--the school, in effect, is the academic equivalent of the towns in previous Russo novels--but the writing is straight high comedy from the word go.<br />I consider Russo to be one of the finest living American writers.  This book is not his best in terms of the writing, story or intensity of the story or characters, but it is his most readable and enjoyable novel to date.  What is lost in terms of the intensity is, for the most part, made up for in humor.  What we are left with is a more lightweight--but a much more fun--reading experience.<br />I've not yea tread Empire Falls, Russo's latest effort, but from the reviews and whatnot it seems he has reverted back tot he form of his previous novels.  So, in fact, Straight Man will stand as an even more significant departure from his &quot;usual&quot; style.<br />Don't let that fact divert your from this book, however.  This is a genuinely fun read.	2002-03-28

The Ultimate Program For Eating Well, Feeling Great, And Living Longer	Books	5	93	100	N	N	Colbert�s not fond of the dishes you find at church socials!	Let's be honest here--there's no magic bullet out there for weight loss-if there were, there wouldn't be as many weight loss and diet books in the Amazon 1000 top sellers.<br />What Would Jesus Eat? The Ultimate Program For Eating Well, Feeling Great And Living Longer doesn't really say anything new in terms of dietary regimens.  Dr. Colbert recommends what you would expect-a lot of whole grains, fruits and vegetables along with limited consumption of meat-particularly red meat-and other fatty foods.<br />What's interesting here is that he explains the benefits not only in the general terms of \\"good eating habits\\" as medically established but through an examination of the foods we know-and can reasonably infer-Jesus consumed.  \\"We follow Jesus' dictates and example in all other facets of our life\\", says Colbert, \\"why not in our eating habits as well\\"?<br />The book has two unique features beyond the above-cited encouragements.<br />The first is that he presents an excellent examination of the ins-and-outs of ancient Jewish dietary law along with very clear explanations of why those laws were so sound nutritionally.<br />The second-and this is truly unique for such a faith based text-Colbert explains the benefits of moderate alcohol intake-especially as regards red wine.  This is not going to be popular in some more conservative Christian circles, but the fact he takes the time and effort-and displays the courage-to do so in a faith based text certainly adds credibility to the authority of his narrative and recommendations.<br />The second half of the book is primarily recopies and a practical guide to adopting and implementing this diet.  Nothing extraordinary but very thoughtfully constructed and presented-one of the best I've seen<br />As Orson Wells once observed, \\"Gluttony is not a private sin.\\"  The real question is not whether this is a good book with good advice-it is both-it's weather the spin of the WWJ Eat concept is sufficiently motivating to actually getpeople to get on-and stay on-the program.  Perhaps so-a lot of people find willpower in faith where they cannot find it in reason.  Even if that's not the case, at least the reader will have learned quite a bit about their dietary traditions and heritage, so everybody who reads the books stands to be better off in one way or another.	2002-03-26

Clarke provides a new, inventive twist on the \\"we are not alone\\" vein of science fiction.<br />In 2130, a new celestial body is discovered heading toward the Sun. Earthlings name this object &quot;Rama&quot;.  Satellites reveal this to be a \\"man made\\" object, if you will-a hollow cylinder of vast proportions.  An manned expedition is mounted and the team eventually does Rendezvous with-and enter-Rama.<br />The twist Clarke provides is two fold.  The first is, we never meet the Raman's.  presumably there are in there somewhere, but other than some \\"maintenance\\" type biots, no sentient creatures ever make the scene in the story.<br />The second twist is that earthlings aren't a factor in this story-that is, it develops the Raman's are simply using our sun as a turning point/acceleration mechanism.  We are beneath their notice.<br />The actual driving force behind the novel is the exploration of the ship.  This aspect Clarke develops with the aplomb and savvy you would expect from such an accomplished sci-fi veteran.  This stands as a remarkably suspenseful novel, quite an achievement given there are no alien confrontations to spice things up.<br />There are a couple of problems with the book.  The technology aspects of the earth ship and the explorer's tools are pathetic-you'd think there's been no technological advancement in either space travel or hand tools in 130 years-not too likely.  And this book has \\"sequel\\" written all over it. I dislike books that seek to be deliberately commercially manipulative.  This is a particularly egregious example of that phenomenon.<br />Neither of these factors appreciably detracts from the story, however, but I am deducting a star because of the manipulation factor.  <br />So take a trip to Rama-you'll enjoy it!	2002-03-26

On a macro level world historythat is, human history-concerns four basic forces whichseparately or in combinationhave shaped human behavior:  the forces of nature, the force of a dominate personality, the force of ideas, and covetousness, for land, power, weathhwhatever.<br />The subtitle of this book is A World History.  The title is deserved for the history of mans quest for salt is in many ways a wonderful mechanism of microcosm for the greater spectrum of world history.<br />This is by no means to only major commodity history aroundthere have been other recent books about the potato, sugar, coffee, gold, jade, porcelain, various dyes (mauve, indigo), nutmeg and sundry other spices over the past several years.. At their worst, these commodity histories are complacent annals of consumption; at their best, they up-end our ideas of history's motive forces. <br />Salt: A World History by Mark Kurlansky ranks among the very best.<br />Salt isn't just a seasoning, it's a life substance, vital to the proper functioning of the human body. For as long as there have been humans, they've had to find or create salt to live. The history of salt is the history of humanity. <br />This is, in actuality, several books in one: a food history, a recipe book, a travelogue and a cultural history. It contains images which will long stay with you: the body of a Bavarian salt miner prized from collapsed salt caves centuries after his death, for instance, perfectly preserved right down to the bright colors of his clothes. It is also stylishly written and wonderfully learned, covering a vast geographical and historical span. William Blake famously suggested that the world was to be seen in a grain of sand; Kurlansky has seen it in a grain of salt.<br />Every piece of evidence in this book is arranged to point to salt as an agency of enormous power. It has determined the geography of warfare, urban growth (almost all Italian cities were built near a saltworks) and mostof the world's trade routes. Kurlansky even links the 'whimsical, non-geometric' pattern of North America's secondary roads to salt: 'The roads are simply widened footpaths and trails... originally cut by animals looking for salt.' These are the salt-lines of history, invisible on a map but brought beautifully to light by Kurlansky. <br />The book is broadly chronological. We begin at a salt works in ancient China and end nearly 500 pages later amid the health wars over salt in the twenty-first century. Along the way, the reader is rewarded with superb thumbnail histories of the world's main civilizations; digressions into ketchup, chilli pepper, olives, embalming techniques, pickling and mustard gas; dozens of salty recipes; a beautiful little essay on Matisse, fauvism and anchovy fishermen. <br />This is a truly wonderful book.  However, it shoulkd be noted that it is not as good as Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World.  Cod was an ecological novel.  Infused with a sadness for the passing of the cod, that book was a heartfelt elegy for that wonderful creature.  Salt is a mineral.  The previous work was both an emotional and intellectual triumph.  This is an intellectual triumph.  This is a function of the subject matter rather than any deficiency on Kurlansky's part.  However, there is a distinct difference in the reading experience between the two books readers of Cod ought to be cognizant of.<br />Moreover, Kurlansky's latest lacks this unifying attitude and occasionally lapses into a rather boring occasional recital of statistics and factoids. <br />But those are quibblesthis is a great book.  <br />Spice up your lifetake on this giant size helping of salt!	2002-03-25

It's only after reading this fascinating book that one fully appreciates the irony intrinsic to the title.  This is a book that is thoroughly atypical in virtually all its aspects.<BR>Typical American follows the lives of three Chinese immigrants in New York: Ralph Chang, his sister Theresa, and Theresa's roommate Helen, who becomes Ralph's wife. Theresa becomes a doctor, Ralph earns a Ph. D. in mechanical engineering and gets a job teaching at a local college, and Ralph and Helen have two daughters.<br />As they each become caught up in achieving the American dream, they must make difficult choices about the importance of success, family loyalty, and the people they hope to become.<BR>Essentially, however, like all immigrant tales, the underlying aspect of the story is one of assimilation.   Usually tales of Chinese assimilation into the American mainstream demand the forsaking of Chinese customs; conversely, preservation of Chinese traditions requires the rejection of any possibilities of assimilation. The dramatization of such cultural conflicts has become somewhat formulaic, and Chinese-American writers seem locked in this conventional depiction of the Chinese immigrant experience.<br />Not Gish Jen.  In Typical American Gish Jen rewrites the formula that has long dominated Chinese-American immigrant fiction, and complicates firm notions of Chinese and American identities that have been staple elements of that formula.<br />Normally these assimilation tales are multi-generational sagas where the conventional opposition between American and Chinese cultures is usually played out through generational conflicts, in which the older, immigrant generation's insistent preservation of Chinese traditions are pitted against their first -generation offspring's desire to cast off those manacles.<br />Not here.  Eschewing this \\"typical\\"' setting for her narrative, Jen breaks from the paradigmatic use of Chinatown that has been a staple of Chinese immigrant narratives. This also removes the Changs from the clutches of parental demands or strict Chinatown societal codes.  Rather than settling in an established Chinese community for moral and financial support Ralph, Helen and Theresa remain very isolated in their new life in America.  This isolation from the \\"parental' or \\"traditional\\" elements of Chinese culture enables Jen to illustrate the conflicts inherent to cultural assimilation within the context of the individual rather than a group.  And, so, while the characters strive mightily to achieve \\"typical American\\" status-the full middle class lifestyle with all the accouterments and benefits that implies-they nevertheless still see many of the traits and behaviors attendant to that lifestyle through Chinese eyes and refer to these behavioral traits in Anglos pejoratively as \\"typical American\\" Behavior.  Thus they are in the position of decrying what they actively seek to attain, thus brilliantly illustrating the often schizoid process of assimilation.<br />The first line of the book asserts that this is \\"an American story\\", but in fact this is neither a \\"typical Chinese-immigrant\\" story, nor a \\"\\"typical American\\" one.  In the end, no one is \\"typical\\" anything. Ralph's revelation at the end is not the disillusionment of a Chinese nor an American, but simply a man confused by the complexity of the new context that surround him: \\"Kan bu fian. Ting bu fian. He could not always see, could not always hear. He was not what he made up his mind to be.<br />Both Ralph's and Helen's revelations at the end of the book 'are critical moments in which Jen invalidates the generational/ cultural conflict paradigm; she has deftly shown that the notion that the choice that one \\"stay Chinese\\" or \\"become American\\" is an illusion.  In fact, the \\"typical\\" immigrant will never be either.<br />This is a wry, ironic, emotionally complex novel that is well worth reading.	2002-03-23
US	53013845	R1R2XDERZ3JBIM	0452272092	655247096	So Far from God	Books	4	41	43	N	N	Extraordinarily mystical --very unusual story.	Hispanic writing today seems to fall within three distinct categories, i.e., contemporary fiction (mostly urban in context), historical fiction and mystical fiction. This novel is most emphatically a work of mystical fiction.<br />Set in Chicana country the story is both down-to-earth and full of unearthly happenings. Its matter-of-fact delivery serves to make the magical believable. When one character is dying of AIDS, a Doctor Tolentino and his wife come to help her. His ministrations involve prayers and cotton wool soaked in holy oil. But then he reaches into La Loca's stomach `maintaining his left \\"material\\" hand in the opening, while the right \\"spirit\\" hand sought out the maladies' and `pulled out some cystic fibroids and finally a tumour...' The lines between the surgical and the miraculous are blurred and anything seems possible. Castillo uses a direct colloquial style with little regard for punctuation, almost as if the writer is confiding her thoughts directly to the reader. Each chapter is prefaced with a description of what is going to happen next but phrased in such a way as to make the book impossible to put down. For instance: `Of the Hideous Crime of Francisco el Penitente, and his Pathetic Calls Heard Throughout the Countryside as His Body Dangled from a Pinnion like a Crow-Picked Pear; and of the End of Caridad and Her Beloved Emerald Which We Nevertheless Will Refrain from Calling Tragic.'<br />So Far from God is a tale both tragic and funny; a hymn to women's endurance and to the harshness of their lives.  It is a heavily allegorical tale.  The novel has Sofia, the embodiment of \\"wisdom,\\" at its core, a mother who survives the death of her four daughters: Esperanza, Fe, Caridad, and La Loca. The names of the first three daughters denote the three major Christian ideals. However, in the cruelest of ironies, the destiny of each of these characters is the antithesis of the ideal the name represents.<br />Esperanza, the most liberated of the sisters,devotes the energy of her college years to the Chicano Movement. She lives her life as a glowing example of La Raza Politics, working to better the lives of her people. But her death as a television reporter covering the Gulf Crisis is utterly meaningless. The reader is left without any hope or, better yet, \\"Esperanza,\\" of finding redemption in this character's demise.<BR>Fe, the sister who most subscribes to the traditions of her culture, desires nothing more than to participate fully in society's patriarchal mandate for women to marry and serve their husbands. <br />She does, finally, find a man who will fulfill her dream of marrying: her cousin Casimiro. He is completely devoted to her, and together they plan a blissful future. In order to secure this, however, Fe leaves her safe position at the bank for a higher paying job at an arms manufacturing company. She tackles her work with her usual diligence and earns a promotion. Thus, her faith in the American Way of Life is rewarded. This \\"promotion,\\" however, proves fatal as the company exposes her to a hazardous chemical that causes her death from cancer. In the end, the faith that Fe places in the basic tenets of society and its culture completely fails her. Thus, faith also becomes meaningless.<br />Caridad, after being abandoned by her husband, became known for \\"loving anyone she met at the bars who vaguely resembled Memo\\" (27). Because of her promiscuous life, she is brutally raped and disfigured by a mysterious and misogynist spirit identity known as the \\"malogra.\\" In this manner, Caridad's charity towards men is severely punished. However, she heals miraculously and from that moment on, she no longer has an interest in men. Caridad becomes an apprentice curandera, and during a religious pilgrimage with her mentor, she spots a woman with whom she instantly falls in love. Caridad never reconciles herself with her homosexual feelings until she suddenly and dramatically leaps off of a cliff while holding hands with Esmeralda, the object of her affection, as they are being pursued by Francisco el Penitente, Caridad's obsessed stalker. Those who witness the jump search for the bodies, but they are never found.<br />La Loca is without question the most intriguing of the sisters. Dead at age three, she resurrects and is immediately believed to possess miraculous powers. The residents of Tome accept the young girl's return from the dead as being of a divine nature and they dub her \\"La Loca Santa.\\" Following her return, however, she shuns human contact and only lets her mother touch her. She also rarely speaks, but her resurrection has spoken volumes for her. La Loca is the embodiment of a miracle; she cannot be preoccupied with the mundane task of finding a job, like her sisters. She remains at home, content in her solitude. Her household chores are to tend her animals, keep the house clean, and cook. She does, though, assist in the healing of Fe and Caridad, and she performs abortions for the latter because La Loca instinctively \\"knew all about a woman's pregnancy cycle\\". Toward the novel's end, she becomes ill and is diagnosed with the HIV virus, even though she had never participated in any activity commonly associated with its acquisition.  Ultimately, La Loca's destiny, like those of her sisters, is to die at an early age. On a surreal death pilgrimage to an Albuquerque hospital, the people canonize her and eventually declare her the patron saint of kitchens, new brides, and progressive grooms. La Loca's life, then, is characterized by her first death, resurrection, contraction of AIDS without human contact, and her canonization. After the deaths of hope, faith, and charity, the three theological ideals of the Church, and the death of what can arguably be construed as the female personification of Jesus Christ in the personage of La Loca, all that remains is Sofia's wisdom.<br />Sofia has a feckless husband - who suddenly appears after an absence of twenty years - and fourdaughters who suffer all the indignities known to woman. But she decides to become the Mayor of Tome and goes on to found a workers' co-operative and MOMAS (`Mothers of Martyrs and Saints'). Sofia endures, no, she triumphs - while at the same time retaining her sense of humour. <br />So Far from God is wacky and powerful. Its humor belies a strong political message - that in a world which deals them many harsh blows, women are still survivors, after death as well as during life.	2002-03-23

At a time when the various media t parody the inflated world of expression, it's hard to see art as a threat. After all, isn't high art passé, the avant garde a joke?   Has'nt he web rendered the museum an anachronism? Howard Norman's novel, The Museum Guard, set in pre-World War II Canada, would have us believe otherwise. The novel is an intricate tale of the way art works upon lives-not those of its creators, but those of its caretakers. Their troubles demonstrate that art has the ability, not only to create its own reality, but to distort ours.  At its core, is a novel about obsession and its more destructive attributes.<br />The Museum Guard sets the quiet world of the Glace Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, against the impending doom of World War II. Understated, fastidious DeFoe Russet and his passionate, slovenly uncle Edward are guards in the museum. Each in his own way loves Imogen Linny, caretaker of the Jewish cemetery. The atmosphere is highly charged and precipitous--so much so that lives are altered by the arrival of a painting. <BR>While DeFoe is troubled and intrigued by the art in his charge, Imogen is destroyed by it. She mistakes book learning for enlightenment and connoisseurship for nobility; lacking these, she seeks refinement and personal insight in the fierce perusal of one of DeFoe's charges, the painting Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam. Her study of this painting quickly becomes a fixation. The once-consiencious DeFoe finds himself first abetting Imogen in midnight visits to the painting, then stealing it for her.<br />As her obsession grows, Imogen comes to believe that she is the woman in the painting, causing her to abandon both her former identity and DeFoe. She attempts to return to her \\"homeland\\" in Amsterdam, a suicidal trip because, having taken on the dress, manner and Jewish persona of the woman in the painting, she is heading into territory soon to be enveloped by German armies.<BR>In the last portion of the novel, DeFoe surrenders the narrator's role to the curator, who is acting as an inept chaperone for Imogen on her journey. His letters from an Amsterdam paralyzed by imminent war are vividly unlike DeFoe's careful, riveting prose. The narrative is clunky and artificial, the plot almost mechanical. As he describes it, in an apt example of his artless voice, \\"there was no possible way I could have foreseen how utterly peculiar an experience this all would prove.\\" Imogen's further decline and eventual disappearance are obscured by this prose, distorting a narrative that up to this point has been absolutely convincing. This contrived technical failure calls attention to the novel's ability to create or uncreate a world-a technique so intriguingly self-conscious that it makes up for the dull prose.<br />Through its powerful sense of history and unique triangle of unrequited love, The Museum Guard explores the mysteries of identity and art, and the desire to step out of ordinary life into the alluring and dangerous sphere of action.  Unfortunately, the stylistic flat tire at the end of the novel also illustrates one of the dangers of art that the novel seeks to demonstrate, namely the power of art to communicate to us at supra-intellectual levels.  In the end the curator is unable to convey the pathos of Imogen's delusion or the horror of oncoming war; all his cultivation leaves him bereft of the capacity to communicate what the picture at issue communicates so powerfully. <br />Imogen can certainly communicate, but in her sensitivity to art she has sacrificed the ability to perceive reality. DeFoe, with whom one feels a painful empathy, is the middle ground between the dangers of insularity and insanity. He retains both sensitivity and sanity in the face of art and with the understanding of Imogen's defection and probable death. <BR>With these examples, sometimes tragic, sometimes ludicrous, the novel seeks a vindication of art. It warns us to avoid, not only the extremes of fascination, butthe sterility of the over-refinement. <br />While the device of abandoning the narration towards the end seriously undermines a fine effort, the book nevertheless is extremely engaging even in its weak moments.  In the end, this book is proof of its own theory, that art is neither impotent, nor irrelevant.  It is what we make of it.	2002-03-23

While the man is gifted with the ability to develop wonderful characters, my experience is that his characters often far outshine his stories--you are often left with the sense that the character deserved a much better story than the one they ended up in.<br />This is not the case with Walking Across Egypt, a book where the story is the equal to the characters--which is good because the characters are among Edgerton's best.<br />Mattie Rigsbee is an independent, strong-minded senior citizen of 78 years who might just be slowing a bit--after all, it does take her two days to mow her acre of lawn these days.  <br />In short order Miss Mattie has picked up two strays--a moth eaten mutt of a dog and Wesley Benfield, a young delinquent on the lam.  Miss Hattie, lonely as she can be, sees it as her Christian duty to see to these two strays--with hilarious consequences.<br />The book has a fine sense of comedic flair and is wonderfully paced.  The dominant story is both quaint and heartwarming without getting schmaltzy or overly sentimental.  And, for once, there is a genuinely serious side to this book as it examines how Mattie's friends-all good, Christian church going ladies, react to her acts of Christian charity.  <br />Edgerton has a good feel for the nuances of small town life and the characters who live there.  <br />This is a little gem of a book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2002-03-22

What actually happens during \\"clinical death\\"? Why do we age, and what happens to the body? This National Book Award winner Particularly recommended for anyone in a position to explain these difficult processes to others.  This award-winning account describes in frank yet compassionate detail just what most of us are likely to face when the time comes, Sherwin B. Nuland's How We Die combines erudition and eloquence in a refreshingly unsentimental look at the processes of death.   A distinguished surgeon and gifted writer, Nuland illuminates the mechanisms of cancer, heart attack, AIDS, and Alzheimer's disease with precision and compassionate awareness.<br />Why read such a book? Taking away the fear of the unknown can bring courage and peace in the face of a difficult time. This book presents unpleasant facts in simple language that anyone can understand. <br />Chapters cover different types of death, making clear the physiological changes and medical choices that go along with each one. It addresses both medical and emotional realities of common conditions such as cancer, heart disease, AIDS, Alzheimer's, severe trauma, and just plain wearing out.   (Be prepared to cry, since reading this book may make you experience feelings associated with people you love.)<br />What makes this book such compelling reading is that Nuland brings to this subject all of the depth and breadth of his background AND his deep concern for the human condition. His long career at a high-powered academic medical center (Yale), his knowledge of the history of medicine, of literature and philosophy, and his own personal losses are all woven into his thesis. He is thus highly convincing when he criticizes physicians for becoming seduced by the intellectual challenge of solving \\"The Riddle\\" and making recommendations not in the best interests of the patient/family. <br />But the power of the book is in its intensely personal depiction of these events and in the lessons which Nuland draws from his experiences. The message is twofold: very few will \\"die with dignity\\" so that (1) it behooves us to lead a productive LIFE of dignity, (2) physicians, patients, and families should behave appropriately to allow nature to take its course instead of treating death as the enemy to be staved off at any cost. Only then will it be possible for us to die in the \\"best\\" possible way--in relative comfort, in the company of those we love/who love us.<br />A \\"must read\\" for those of us in the baby-boomer generation who, unfortunately,  are going to have to deal with a lot of what's covered in this book over the remainder of our lives.	2002-03-22

This is, essentially, a coming of age story-the fact that most of the primary characters are in their 30's notwithstanding.<br />Tom Perrotta's The Wishbones follows the various travails of Dave Raymond.  Though in his 30's, Dave still lives at homes with his rather long suffering parents.  Dave also has a long suffering girlfriend of 20 years.  Actually, virtually everyone Dave knows well is long suffering--that appears to be the price you pay for having a son/friend who hasn't quite grown up.<br />Saddled with a dead-end day job, Dave's life actually revolves around his Band, The Wishbones, which plays wedding gigs on the weekends.<br />Dave is intelligent and aware enough to recognize his shortcomings--he's a good, not great guitarist with no original music vision of his own whatsoever--but not yet sufficiently emotionally mature=or secure-enough to toss in the towel on his dreams of musical stardom.<br />As event unfold, Dave finally gets up the nerve to propose to his girlfriend--then immediately stars getting cold feet.<br />There is not one single surprise to be found anywhere in this entire novel. Yet, the book is anything but boring.  Perrotta has a wonderful talent for developing intricate, interesting and engaging characters, skillfully evokes the sense of Dave's New Jersey neighborhood, has a finely tuned sense of comedic flair and is adept with dialog.  This is one of those books that proves that predictable doesn't have to be boring.<br />In point of fact, a lot of surprise and unexpected plot machinations would not have worked anyway, making what is, and was always meant to be, on ordinary, daily life sort of story seem contrived and hokey.<br />The ending is rather anti-climatic even so, and there are some rough passages to be gotten through--Dave's whole flirtation with joining a Christian rock band seems out of place, for instance.  But these are minor flaws in an otherwise competent, witty and engaging story.<br />So, tune into the Wishbones and enjoy a pleasant read!	2002-03-22

I Want to Buy a Vowel is a light, satirical look at small town life in Texas through the eyes of two key characters--eleven-year-old Eva Galt, the somewhat precocious and philosophical daughter of a local preacher and Alfredo Santayana, a Guatemalan émigré who thumbs his way to Texas in search of the good life North of the border and whose \\"command\\" of English is based on his exposure to the TV show \\"Wheel of Fortune\\".<br />Welter does a masterful job of setting the stage for the sort of offbeat antics that so color the life of a small town.  There's the uproar over the sighting of an image of the Virgin Mary in a stamp machine in the local post office, the local grocers decision to paint a replica of the Sistine Chapel on his store ceiling and the discovery of what appears to be the residue of Satanic cult activities on the outskirts of town-your typical Texas summer stuff in Waxahachie, Texas.<br />The book works because Welter has a fine feel for gently gibing comedy on the one hand and a true gift for developing sympathetic and enjoyable characters, especially kids characters, on the other hand.  Eva, particularly, is a delight, but even the more peripheral characters--such as the Sheriff, are delightful as well.<br />Welter also clearly understands the dynamics of the intricate web of character, tradition and circumstance that constitutes small town living.<br />The end result is a charming and extremely funny book that has you running back to the bookshelves hoping there is a sequel to be read.  With luck, perhaps someday Welter will treat us to one.	2002-03-22

Truelove and Homegrown Tomatoes is the wonderful, luscious, bittersweet story of how Imogene Lavender and her two daughters, Loutishie and Jeannete-one actually her niece and the other adopted-cope with life after Imogene's husband, Silas, passes on.  <br />This is a story told with compassion and affection from tow distinctly different points of view-that of Imogene, through the regular text, and that of Loutishie, told through her journal.  It chronicles their grieving for their father and husband and the inevitably difficult process of picking up the pieces and moving on.  The book elegantly evokes the aspects of Southern tradition, mores and custom that both facilitate and aggravate that process.<br />Cannon's particularly gifted at characterization.  Even minor characters are reverently constructed and rendered so that by the end of the book you feel as if you yourself are in fact a resident of Euharlee, Georgia and privy to all the goings on, habits and secrets and traditions that are common fodder in any such small rural enclave. <br />The construction of the story is extremely effective, with a short quote from each chapter which acts as an introduction, followed by Imogene's story, followed by Lou's journal.  <br />This is the sort of story that grabs you by the heartstrings and won't let go, even after the book is over.  It's a truly wonderful debut.<br />I can only hope-and pray-- that this is but the first in a long line of novels by Julie Cannon.	2002-03-21

Andre Lang, when asked to review the work of one of his rivals, once observed, \\"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lampposts--for support rather than for illumination.\\"<br />This observation sums up in a nutshell one of the major premises of Bjorn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, wherein Mr. Lomborg analyzes-and in large part rejects-much of the statistical analysis used to \\"prove\\" the validity of many of the assumptions that support current \\"mainstream\\" environmental \\"science\\".<br />Thirty years ago, many smart people believed that, by now, the population explosion would have knocked the world into a catastrophic famine, killing hundreds of millions of people. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, predicted back then that by the year 2000 Japan would run out of food and an armada of famished Chinese would invade Russia. Needless to say, these predictions, like virtually all others made in that book,  were wrong: although the number of humans on Earth has almost doubled since 1960, there are fewer hungry people now than there were four decades ago. Just eight percent of humankind now lives in nations with insufficient average calorie intakes; according to the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, that represents the lowest such percentage in human history.  Moreover, recent U. N. reports suggest hallowed assumptions about the rates of world population growth appear to be highly questionable at the least.<br />Has Mr. Ehrlich's credibility and stature been adversely affected by the fact that developments have utterly failed to support his theories and projections?  Not in the slightest!  He's still considered an \\"expert\\" in this area by many!<br />That is why this is book is so important.  <br />Using a rigidly objective statistical approach Mr. Lomborg examines the factual basis for a number of popularly accepted \\"Environmental Truths\\" and reaches, in some but not all cases, very different conclusions about the validity of many of the assumptions accepted as gospel within the environmental community.  Mr. Lomborgs aim, as the subtitle to the book suggests, is not simply to disprove and bludgeon the environmental community.  It is, rather, to provide some objective analysis with the goal of fostering an environment wherein actual debate over reality based facts can occur that could lead to actual development of measures that could provide meaningful, cost effective solutions to real, as opposed to assumed, problems.<br />In a world where the Paul Ehrlich's-and they are legion within the environmental community-can be so wrong, so often, for so long, the development of a skeptical view of the assumptions underlying much of what constitutes \\"environmental science\\" can only be a good thing.  With The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, Mr. Lomborg has skillfully used logic and reason to jumpstart that process.<BR>Whether you agree or disagree with Mr. Lomborg, this is a book anyone who is concerned with public environmental policy formation needs to read.	2002-03-21
US	53013845	R2NI0C2JG52FBW	0895261901	148709607	Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News	Books	3	36	66	N	N	Interesting viewpoint-very muddled analysis.	I bought Bernard Goldberg\\"s Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News at an airport news stand between flights on a recent business trip.  What caught my eye was a \\"blurb\\" prominently splashed across the front cover that read  \\"'Bias' should be taken seriously.\\"  And who was that quote from?  Why that bastion of liberal tradition, the New York Times!  How could anyone pass on that sort of irony?<br />This book is interesting, but logically it's a mess.  <br />Take the whole \\"Flat Tax\\" flap that serves as the instigator of Goldberg's public feud with his bosses at CBS (he wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal about the reporting on this issue, provoking their ire towards him) which Goldberg chronicles in detail in this book.  Goldberg asserts that CBS's reporting, specifically that of Eric Engberg, was critical of the notion in its entirety and therefore stands as a classic example of \\"liberal media bias\\".  \\"There is absolutely no way\\", he writes \\" that Enberg or Rather would have aired a flat-tax story with that same contemptuous tone if Teddy Kennedy or Hillary Clinton had come up with the idea.\\"  The clear implication is it was the media's liberal bias that colored that story-presumably with the express intent of harming the Republicans and aiding the Democrats in an election year.  What Mr. Goldberg fails to communicate is that this piece came out during the primaries when it's proponent, Steve Forbs, was running against the presumed nominee, Bob Dole.  If you go back and look at that election coverage in the winter and spring of 1996 you will see that all kinds of respectable Republicans-Including Dole, Newt Gingrich and others, were lambasting Forbes's economic plans from all sides.  It was primarily Bob Dole-not the Democrats-who benefited from this coverage.  <br />The basis for Goldberg's allegations, charges and whatnot in the book have two foundations.  The first is his own fist hand experience.  These provide interesting insights and much fodder for contemplation.  However, even some of his own stories muddle his assertions.  For example, one of Goldberg's consistent themes, often repeated throughout this book, is that journalists are so ideologically insular that they \\"can't even recognize their own bias\\".  As evidence he tells the tale-and this is a central event in the book, oft mentioned throughout this text-- of a conversation with CBS News President Andrew Heyward in which the latter allegedly confessed to Goldberg that \\"of course there's liberal bias in the media\\"  but tells Goldberg that \\"if you any of this, I'll deny it\\".  Excuse me, how to you admit to something you are so insular you can't recognize?  It's this sort of muddled logic that permeates this book.<br />The second is the often cited surveys that show a vast majority of journalists, when polled, identify themselves as Democrats.  The implication is that all Democrats are liberal, virtually all journalists are democrats, therefore all journalists are liberal.  There are two problems with this.  The first is, based on my experience living in the south for much longer than I care to admit, is that there are plenty of hard-core conservatives in the Democratic Party.  They aren't called \\"yellow dog\\" Democrats for nothing.<br />The other problem is that when you dig into these surveys they reveal journalists actually look a lot like a lot of middle America when specific issue surveys are included-a bit to the left on social issues, a bit to the right on economic and military issues. <br />Towards the end of the book Goldberg asserts that \\"Ratings are the reason television people (including journalists and their bosses-my addition, not a part of the direct quote) do everything they do\\".    Gee, based on the rest of his book, I thought it was bias.<br />There's another nagging problem here.  For a book that's supposedly the work of a crack investigative journalist, this tome is long on assertion and allegations and very short on objective analysis, data and evidence.  Goldberg obviously genuinely believes in the concept of liberal media bias.  He does precious little to actually document it in concrete ways.<br />Does the media have biases?  Almost surely.  Does this book offer any real, meaningful insight and analysis into the origins, workings and effects of that bias?  Not really.	2002-03-21

Among the primary mythic figures of European civilization, few are more ubiquitous than Hermes, the fascinating, mercurial messenger of the gods, eloquent revealer of hidden wisdom, and guardian of occult knowledge.  Hermes has played a central role in the development of esotericism in the West.<br />Drawing upon many rare books and manuscripts, this highly illustrated work explores the question of where Hermes Trismegistus came from, how he came to be a patron of the esoteric traditions, and how the figure of Hermes has remained lively and inspiring to our own day.<br />Antoine Faivre is reputedly  the most prominent scholar of esoterism to have appeared since Mircea Eliade.  He is Director of Studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Section des Sciences Religieuses, Sorbonne), University Professor of Germanic Studies at the University of Haute-Normandie, and director of the Cahiers de lHermétisme.  All of that scholastic firepower notwithstanding, he delivers his message in a erudite yet free flowing prose style that does not suffer from many of the linguistic glitches translations of scholarly works often contain.  Indeed,  Faivre's elegant erudition, blended with a highly refined metaphysical sensibility, brings the great Hermes to life and allows this powerful psycho-spiritual character to speak once again (and perhaps even play a few much-needed tricks on us), which is appropriate as Hermes is both  a prophetic revealer of wisdom---and also a trickster and deceiver.  Both sides of his character are fully explored within this work.<br />This book is an impressive effort-both intellectually and visually.  This slim volume stands as a compelling contribution in helping to answer the puzzling questions as to both the source and endurance of Hermes in his variety of shape-shifting guises.<br />A must read for anyone with serious interests in Western Occultism.	2002-03-21

Basically it's the story of Ms. Beckermans life from young childhood to mature adulthood told through short yet extremely moving snippets of text and hand drawn pictures of the outfit she wore at critical junctures of her life.<br />The book works because it is open, honest sympathetic yet ordinary enough to relate to.<br />The drawings of outfits are one the whole simple and colorful and have an air of distracted affection about them.  They relate and interact well with the text.  But what sets them apart--and this is a critical element of why the book works so well--is they not only relate to the story but, in any reader, will evoke strong memories of time's and places out of our own lives.  Rather than detracting from the book, this flood of memories in fact lend additional dramatic impact to the reading experience.<br />I have given this as a gift to several women I know and it has been a huge hit with every single one of them.  I keep a couple of copies on hand for those time I need a gift and am too short of time and/or ideas to get anything else.  This habit has stood me in good stead for quite a while now!<br />In the end, this stands as a classic case of synergy if ever I came across one. The story by itself would seem pathetically simplistic.  The drawings by themselves are nothing to rave about.  Taken together, something magical happens, and the result is a whole whose sum is far, far greater then the sum of its parts-a classic case of simple genius.	2002-03-21
US	53013845	R36NV6ZE6X6U4B	0801063892	293836304	After "I Believe": Experiencing Authentic Christian Living	Books	5	38	41	N	N	An excellent primer on the fundamentals of Christian living.	I sometimes liken what passes for Christianity today as a process of administering the equivalent of a religious vaccine--they introduce a watered down shadow of Christianity that has the effect of rendering the recipient immune to the real thing, should he ever see it.  Although I suppose this is not just a modern day phenomenon--as C. S. Lewis noted long ago, the reason so few fail at Christianity is because do few try it.<br />I have my own ideas as to why this is, but more on that in a moment.  First, the book.<br />This is a great book.  It provides a basic overview of what I'd call the &quot;how's and why's&quot; of daily Christian life.<br />So many seem to think so much of what is discussed here is unimportant and/or optional--prayer, worship, fellowship, religious study and so forth are, for some reason, too often seen as minor adjuncts to &quot;the Christian Life&quot;. The book looks at each of these--and other--topics and explains why they are vital to the daily life of Christians and need to be performed/observed/pursued.  The church has lasted over 2000 years in large part because these actions were developed as a means of communicating, enriching and protecting the faith and its followers.  Roberts does an admirable job of explaining the roots of these activities, their history and their importance both to the church in general and to the individual specifically.<br />I particularly like the subtitle of this book--Experiencing Authentic Christian Living.  I believe there are two factors that undermine the Christian faith in general these days.  One is shallowness derived from Christianity as marketing as opposed to Christianity as religion.  Success seems in all too many cases to be based solely on the number of bodies that come through the door.  Entertainment and marketing thus replace faith and evangelism.  The other is Christianity as politics.  The radical right and left seem to have decided that the church pulpit is primarily a political pulpit.<br />This book works because it focuses on Christianity as a faith--not an entertainment or a political medium.  It is not about getting right with your karma or right with a political agenda--it's about getting right with God, complete with an array of actions that will facilitate and strengthen that activity.<br />If you're worried about your temporal life, go to a mega church and join the softball team.  If you are concerned about your spiritual and eternal life, read this book.	2002-03-19

If you want to understand the dynamic of how to manage to \\"immigration problem\\", as so many refer to it, you have to first answer a very basic, very fundamental question.  That question is this:<br />Why are so many willing to risk so much to get to America?<br />This book runs nearly 400 pages.  Does it answer that question?  Heck, it never even asks the question!  Which is amazing, given that the author himself is an immigrant.  By the end of the book I was left to wonder if he even understood why he himself came here.<br />I'll answer the question.  America is the world's beacon of freedom and there are many who yearn to be free.<br />Brimelow and many other reviewers seem to be fixated on the notion that the underpinning of any country is the commonality of its people: race/ethnicity, language, customs, religion, etc., as one previous reviewer stated.  Maybe in Japan. Maybe in Afghanistan.  Perhaps in a lot of places that true.  Not in America. What makes America tick is ideas-the notion of freedom in all aspects of life-the idea one can speak, worship, travel, write, vote and so on in complete and total freedom.  The commonality of America is in it's ideals, not in it's ethnicity, not in it's language, not in it's religion, not in any of those exclusionary or delimiting notions that exist in actuality to separate rather than unite people.<br />And so they risk their lives-on boats, in semi trailers, in sealed rail cars, on inner tubes-in and on whatever, to get here, not to be a part of any religion, not to exist in racial purity, not to share a common language-but to be free to be themselves and live their beliefs as they wish.<br />This is the \\"commonality\\" of America-the glue that binds us together.  The ideals of freedom was what drove every non native American's ancestors to come here, what gave the impetus to form this nation, and what has-and will continue to-hold it together for millennia to come.<br />And that notion is far superior and stronger than any crackpot notion that one can stop the flow.  You can put boats out to sea, erect fences, post guards, do whatever you think will work-and you will fail.  The beacon will shine, the call will be answered, and those desperate for freedom will come, and there isn't a damn thing anyone can do about it.<br />The real \\"problem\\" with immigration is not that so many come, it's that so many here are so blind and oblivious and clueless about the values, allure and power of the ideals of freedom that they can't see these folks for what they are-people just like their own ancestors.  That is, the real \\"problem\\" with immigration is not immigration itself, it's the warrantless stupidity and fear of the ignorant fools who think there is a \\"problem\\" with immigration in the first place because they have no notion of the meaning and power of the ideals of freedom are in the first place.	2002-03-19

I first read Stranger in 1968 when I was 14 years old.  Although not at all sufficiently prepared either in terms of my knowledge of their Bible, philosophy in general or the tenants of ethics and morality to come anywhere near to appreciating the work, it nevertheless made quite an impression.<br />I read it again during my college years and, while better prepared to think about and understand the various religious, moral, et. al., underpinnings of the book, I'm sure I still missed a lot.<br />A few weeks ago I reread the book--and have since reread it again. I may be close to really grasping all the intricacies of the novel.<br />In many ways this was an epic undertaking by Heinlein.  It covers a lot of ground and involves a lot of deep, complex, contentious ideas.  In my youth I read it and thought the book answered a lot of questions.  In my college years I came to understand that the book really contained no answers but raised a lot of interesting questions to which, of course, I had all the answers.  Today, firmly entrenched in middle age, I'm thinking perhaps I've come to the point where I have to admit I don't know the answers, but I really do admire the questions. <br />Stranger in a Strange Land is the story of Valentine Michael Smith, the only human survivor of the first manned mission to Mars.  Born on the journey to members of the crew, Mike, as he's known, was saved by the creatures that inhabit Mars in this story and raised by those entirely non-human entities.<br />Mike's existence is discovered when a follow-up mission arrives at Mars and he is \\"returned\\" to Earth. Mike may have human form, but he is an alien in every sense of the word.  Such a creature would be sure to be at the vortex of a media maelstrom regardless of any other considerations, but Mike's situation is exacerbated by the fact that. Because of a pact entered into be the crew of the original mission, he is heir to all those folks worldly goods-and is enormously wealthy. Moreover, dueto a peculiarity of the space equivalent of international law, he is regarded as the \\"owner\\" of Mars, the sentient creatures inhabiting the planet notwithstanding.  (Sort of like the position of the Indians in the new world after Columbus).<br />A nurse at the hospital where Mike is, essentially, imprisoned on his return to Earth helps Mike escape to the retreat of an eccentric writer, doctor and social critic, one Jubal Harshaw, who acts as Mike's mentor and protector till he's ready to strike out on his own.  Once he does so, he becomes the messianic leader of a \\"new\\" religion (cult?).<br />The book has richly developed, incredibly appealing characters.  It has a complex and wide-ranging plot.  But what the book is in essence is a platform for posing a lot of legal, political, philosophical, moral and religious ideas and/or questions using the device of Mike's alien presence, powers and naiveté as the focal point of expression of those ideas and/or questions.  And, in the end, the book is much more an exercise in visionary Utopian expression than any sort of science fiction story.  And I believe it is that fact that has given this book the long legs and contentious history is has enjoyed.<br />This sin't a book everyone will like, but it is a book everyone should read.	2002-03-19

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change was first published in 1990.  I first read it around 1991 and recently reread it as part of a series of corporate training sessions I'm currently enrolled in.  I had some pretty strong impressions about the book when I first read it and this recent reread gave me the opportunity to refresh my mind as to the books specifics (I remember the main points in general), look at the work with a few years more experience and maturity behind me, thus providing me an opportunity to rethink my impressions and opinions.<br />On the whole, my assessment of the book hasn't changed much.  I was disappointed with the book back then and remain so today.<br />This disappointment has little to do with the validity of the premise of the book or the relevance of the \\"7 Habits\\" it outlines.  Covey has some good points to make and the book has some useful insights into what one could reasonably call a \\"balanced life\\".<br />My problem is that all too often-well, really, almost continually-the book imposes major impediments to getting at, fully understanding and implementing its major premises.  <br />The problems include (1) unbelievable verbosity (Covey seems to think there's no reason to use one word when 7 will do), (2) linguistic pomposity (purportedly this is a book for \\"your family and business lives\\" but I ask you, how often do terms like paradigm,  intra-this or intra-that, globally, leveraged, matrix and so on, and on, and on get used in your family?), (3) excessive jargonistic gymnastics (see {2} previously) and (4) the hard sell for Covey Enterprise accouterments (order our \\"helpful\\" calendar, notebook, pamphlets, and so on, and so on and so on....).<br />In the end, all of the major points could have been made much more clearly and concisely in half the space with much better overall understanding and usability than is available here.<br />The bottom line is this is a book written to be used as a \\"warmand fuzzy\\" business-training tool.  There's nothing wrong with that as long as it's aimed at the right audience.  Unfortunately this is a book aimed at-and written for-executives and all too often imposed on the rank and file. In the end, I doubt either group ever gets what is should out of the excellent ideas and premises that underline the whole effort.<br />In the final analysis, both ten years ago and just recently, I couldn't help but wonder if the book really was written so much as to help the reader or simply a clever device to enrich the author.  I'd like to think it's not the latter-there's too much substance here and, in an obscure way, Covey comes across as a good sort-but the simple fact you think about those sort of things virtually automatically renders the book a failure of a sort, which is as sad as it is unfortunate.	2002-03-18

Caitlin Macy is a very talented lady-she'd have to be to keep me hopeful enough to finish this book.  She has an elegant and engaging prose style, shows flashes innovative dialog and a good sense of pacing.<br />All of that is on display here-yet this is an awful book.<br />The story-such as it is-surrounds the various desires-often bordering on obsession-of three old college acquaintances with one Kate Goodenow.  For this concept to work Kate obviously has to have some element of extraordinary attractiveness and/or allure that's evident to one and all-hopefully including the reader, this being a novel-to justify and provide context to the strength of these men's obsessive behavior.  The problem is Kate comes across as little more than a boring social snob of very little intelligence, less appeal and virtually no visible character.<br />As one reads this abomination the primary reaction one has is to repress the need to scream \\"Grow up you twits!!!\\" about every 5 pages or so.  All of the characters apparently have-and hold-their respective important jobs solely through their elevated social status-no one ever seems to do a jot of work.  Yet, they all seem to feel oppressed and put upon in their professional lives. At least they are projected as having professional lives, which is much more than can be said of their personal lives, which appear to consist of little more than an interminable and inexplicable process of impetuously satisfying whatever morbid, stupid or ridiculous notion crosses their mind at any given moment.<br />It's a testament to Macy's writing ability that I stayed the course to see if any sign of sense or maturity would appear on the scene-it didn't.  All in all, as sad a waste of Macy's talent in writing this as I experienced in reading it.<br />Groucho Marx once observed \\"This is not a book to be put aside lightly-it should be thrown with great force!\\"  This would be a good candidate for such advice.  One can only hope Macy will develop the ability to provide characters and stories equal to her talent in the future.	2002-03-17

I'd received it as a gift from a close friend who knows my reading predilections well--and also knows I've avoided Grisham for a while now as I'd come to see his novels as overly repetitive and, therefore, boring. But every time I'd see her she'd inquire about the book, so, with a sense of dread, I sat down to read it.<br />It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually whiten a very different sort of story.<br />Grumpy Luther Krank and his sweeter wife, Nora, having just shipped their daughter off to Peru and a stint in the Peace Corps, decide to skip Christmas this year to forgo the gifts, the tree, the decorations, the cards, the parties and to spend the dollars saved on a 10-day Caribbean cruise.  Luther wants a vacations from all the Christmas stress and, besides, the cruise will cost less in the long run than indulging in all the holiday hoopla common to the Krank household at that time of year.<br />Unfortunately for Luther, his decision places him in the vortex of a social storm.  Friends, family and neighbors weigh in to communicate the lack of wisdom in such a decision-it seems that Luther's expenditures-or, more precisely, the lack of them--are an issues fort many of these folks.<br />The book is a comedic farce-casting comical aspersions on the social conformity, holiday hoopla and overt commercialism that have come to be so much a part-if not the reson for-Christmas in the U. S.---particularly in the `burbs.<br />A last minute development cause Luther to reevaluate this plan and provides a window for all to reevaluate the meaning of Christmas as well.<br />This is a sweet story with cranky, quirky-yet recognizable characters.  It is told with warmth and affections, not usually traits one associates with Grisham.<br />A lot of people criticize the book as being lightweight.  True, it's not War and Peace, but it never aspires to be.  What it is is an actual story told from the heart aimed at evoking genuine emotions with humor and affection.<br />A lot of folks act like that's some sort of cop out by Grisham.

Think &quot;Salvadore Dali does Alice in Wonderland&quot; and you'll have a pretty good idea what's in store for you with this unusual and inventive remake of the \\"Alice\\" concept.<br />Narrator Phillip Engstrand is a university professor who has made a career out of studying academic environments. Engstrand is obsessed with Alice Coombs, a particle physicist engaged in a bold attempt to replicate the origins of the universe.  That effort results in Lack, a singularity of unusual scope and behavior which Alice has become obsessed with.  <br />Analyzing the twin obsessions cited above from a particle physics viewpoint (Alice at one point says, &quot;Some people think the observer's consciousness determines the spin or even the existence of the electron.&quot; Phillip tells her, &quot;I'm not sure I really exist except under your observation.&quot;) Lethem examines various aspects of love.<br />Because of Alice's obsession, Phillip becomes obsessed as well, particularly when he learns that Alice has tried to enter Lack, unsuccessfully.  This failure merely inflames her obsession. Why does Lack only accept certain items?  Where do they go?  Phillip decides that only chance he has is to enter Lack himself-with unusual and unforeseen results.<br />Lethem is a gifted and creative genius.  This is an engrossing and fascinating story-for those not overwhelmed by the arcane and often mystical aspects of physics and metaphysics that color and complicate the story.<br />While this is not Lethem's best work it is far from his worst.  This nover requires the reader to put in a bit of effort to get into the spirit of things and hang in there at time when the tale is at its most esoteric.  Don't let that stop you.

Tibor Fischer is the adroit master of the biting edge of black comedy.  In Don't Read This Book if You're Stupid he puts that talent to prodigious good use. These 7 stories about life in London told form the perspective of various social misfits and outright losers are biting, hip, edgy and hilarious.<br />Fischer has always been a master of character development-he's even rendered a 5000 year old bowl a convincing main character in The Collector Collector-and that skill is on full display in these stories, even though a couple of them are very short.  The characters may be fully developed-are fully developed--but are also quite loathsome on the whole.  <br />The result is a book that is funny, insightful-and a bit put offing.  These are stories about people on the margins of society-losers, whiners, and predators.  I appreciated the skill and talent on display in every story-I actually liked only a couple of them.<br />Fair warning should be made:  The book has moments of genuine raunchiness-both just general icky raunchiness and a fair amount of sexual raunchiness.  Nothing particularly egregious, but in sufficient volume and sufficient intensity to warrant those who have a problem with that sort of thing to think twice before diving in.<br />The short story is obviously a form Fischer can excel in. I hope one day he'll write a series of stories more in line with the tenor of his novels.  That, I suspect, would be a book I could both appreciate and like as well.	2002-03-16

Why?	Thirty years ago Paul R. Ehrlich, a now famous left wing environmental activist, wrote The Population Bomb, wherein he examined then current population, political and social trends and made a zillion specific predictions-about population, politics and the future of social policy on a worldwide basis.  He predicted a blighted future unless a very specific set of policies he outlined were employed immediately.<br />None of his recommendations were employed. Yet, virtually everything he projects in that work has failed to materialize.  It seems that societies are a lot more resilient than he thought and the range of possible successful policy options was far wider than he ever imagines.  No matter, he's still credited as an \\"expert\\" and taken seriously in some political circles.<br />Almost 15 years ago, Paul M. Kennedy, a highly regarded rightist academic, wrote The Rise And Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000.  According to Kennedy the cost-politically, socially, economically-to the U.S. of being the World's policeman would doom it to economic inferiority and Japan and Germany would be ascendant economic hegemonistic powers by the turn of the century.  He saw no possible way to avoid this outcome.<br />Obviously, he was very wrong.  No matter, he's still a respected \\"expert\\" voice in many circles today too.<br />I could give other examples, but you get the idea.<br />In The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization, Patrick J. Buchanan sets about putting his foot in his mouth as well.  He makes a lot of sweeping predictions-none of which are at all likely to ever come to fruition-based on very little fact and a lot of bias, as far as I can tell.  It seems Buchanan, though he presents himself as an adroit historian, has failed to pick up on the fact that western societies in general-and the American society in particular-historically are far more flexible, accommodating and resilient than most commentators ever seem able to give them credit for.  I suspect that will be the case here as well.<br />Read this book now and what you will be exposed to is a mishmash of politically motivated and biased economic, social and political analysis of no substance whatsoever.  On the other hand, if you hold on to it for, say 15 to 20 years and reread it then, no doubt you will this book's pathetic predictions so outlandish as to rate as high comedic relief.<br />The only question will be:  Will Buchanan himself still be taken seriously in certain political circles in 20 years?<br />Probably.

I am a frequent flyer (over 170 plane trips last year) and Stuart Woods represents a very significant resource for someone like me.  He is a competent suspense writer with a much larger than average portfolio who is popular enough that his books can be found in some quantity in almost any airport bookstore and/or newsstand in America.  <br />There are times you've just got to find something to read in about 4 minutes--in those instances, Woods is a no brainer.<br />This is not to say he's the best suspense writer around--he isn't.  But, as my old man used to say, \\"Competence compensates for an awful lot...\\"<br />With Woods, you know you are getting well conceived, well developed characters.  Moreover, Woods understands the mechanics of suspense and uses that knowledge to good effect.  If Woods has a failing, it's that his stories are uneven.  Good characters and good mechanics don't add up to enough--a credible story line is needed as well.  Woods never goes totally off the deep end, but he has been known to stretch credulity pretty badly out of shape.<br />These are high grade potboilers.<br />Hest is one of Woods better efforts. Jesse Warden is a hard as nails cop in the pen for planning to rip off the goods from a sting.  He's offered an out to infiltrate and do in a Waco like survivalist cult group.  I won't dwell on the details--you can well imagine them--and be pretty much on the money.  But the characters are superb, the story line tight and consistent, the suspense at high tension level.<br />If page turning potboilers are your thing, Woods is your man.	2002-03-16

Growing up in Chicago, Jesse Jackson's home base, one always heard the whispers and innuendo about Jesse Jackson--and not just from his enemies and detractors &quot;on the right&quot;.  This is a man who has always walked a fine line.  <br />Jesse has been controversial within the civil rights community, where many believe Jackson had greatly exaggerated and manipulated the truth about the scope and nature of his relationship with Martin Luther King, Jr., pushed other spokespersons aside to assure the spotlight stayed firmly on Jesse himself, talked one game while playing another with his various operations-particularly Operation Push and his relationships with various corporations, and so on.  There were always rumors about his personal life.  And, most interestingly, rumors within the religious community, where many wondered how anyone could take \\"Reverend\\" Jackson seriously given he had no actual, visible religious life to speak of.<br />Of course, the \\"powers that be\\" in Chicago didn't always-heck, lets be honest, virtually never-dealt with Jackson and his fellow travelers with much integrity, honesty or respect.  That rumors and innuendo surrounded Jesse was no real surprise-they surrounded the perceived enemies of the Chicago power structure in all cases regardless of race, creed or nationality.  So, one heard all this but remained skeptical-it was what you expected.  Nonetheless, one always had a bit of a queasy feeling about Jesse-something just didn't jive there.<br />Apparently there was a reason for that.  Kenneth R. Timmerman's book raises question by the boatload.  Well, actually, it makes allegations and accuses Jesse of great improprieties by the boatload. Does Timmerman have an obvious agenda?  You bet he does-this is no fan by any stretch of the imagination.  Should we therefore dismiss what he says here?<br />No objective observer can do that.   I was  pretty ambivalent about the man generally but this book is, if nothing else, a \\"smoking gun\\" witha vengeance.  Given many of the recent revelations that even Jackson himself has had to make in recent months and years, the case Timmerman makes is both thorough and impressive.  Is all of it true?  Who knows?  That's not the main point.  If even a substantial portion of it is true, the best you can say is that sleaze seems to be a core component of Jackson's personality and worldview.<br />There will be those who have a knee jerk reaction to defend Jackson and attack Timmerman.  Of course, there are still people who say Nixon was railroaded.  The hardcore Jackson supporter/hater will be swayed by nothing written here.  The objective observer will have grave doubts about this man---and his legitimacy as a spokesperson for racial, social and economic justice.<br />The real shame is it's guy's like Jesse who crowd out those who have a genuine desire to do social good.  The real crime of his life isn't the corporations and organizations he's shaken down, it's that in that process he represses by his actions those who would genuinely help their people.  That's the truly unforgivable part of this sad, sorry story.	2002-03-14

The \\"works\\" targeted by Trickster here is the life of Sam Hunter, the Southern California makeover of the former reservation baby known as Samson Hunts Alone of the Crow reservation in Montana.<br />The plot involves Sam's involvement/Tricksters interference with Calliope, a classic, comic version of the hippie child of hippie syndrome so common in LA, the setting for this farcical tale.<br />The book continues in the vein of Moore's works in general--looping, fantastic flights of fancy, complex yet entertaining plots, and frequent wise guy humor that leaves the reader laughing out loud.<br />This book differs from his other efforts only in that the story line is more controlled and more thoroughly constructed than is usual. It gives the book the feel of an actual, complete novel in the traditional sense.  <br />However, one does not read Moore to experience novelistic integrity-one reads Moore to laugh one's head off.  This novel, like all his others, scores a bull's-eye on that score.<br />If what you are looking for is a lot of laughs and  a rollicking good time, Moore is your guy and this book will satisfy those cravings in droves.	2002-03-14

It contains a lot of very basic-yet useful-information for the novice flyer.  There's a lot of info about basic rules for luggage, clearing security, where to fly on planes, handling general flying SNAFU's and hassles and so on.  <br />What there isn't a lot of is useful information about dealing with the &quot;fear of flying&quot; syndrome.  If you have mild anxiety due to unfamiliarity or uncertainty about the overall experience, this book is helpful.  If you fear is more along the lines of a phobia, this book is useless.<br />From a general information standpoint the book deserves more than 2 stars, but the title is so misleading I had to dock it stars, mainly because I think a lot of people are buying this for information it just doesn't contain.  Flying for Dummies or What You Need to Know About Flying A to Z would have been more honest, accurate title choices.	2002-03-13

I am the sort of flyer who gets on a plane, buckles his seatbelt and falls asleep.  I have absolutely zero fear of flying.<br />Unfortunately, my ability to sleep on planes has convinced my friends and colleagues that I possess the secret to overcoming the dreaded FEAR OF FLYING. This is absolutely not the case.  Having never once had such a fear-thus having nothing to overcome-I have no clue as to how one deals with that problem.<br />Fortunately, Duane Brown does.  More importantly, he is able to articulate and explain that skill to others.<br />Mr. Brown understands flying, understands the causes of the anxieties and phobias that cause the dreaded FEAR OF FLYING, and provides useful and effective mechanisms folks can use to, if not eliminate the phenomenon. At least make it manageable.<br />This book is so good I bought a couple of copies to have on hand.  Someone will come by and start a conversation that I discern is about this fear (it usually takes folks a while to get there) and I simply hand them a copy and tell them \\"Read this-it'll get you over the hump.\\"  Every person I have ever given it to (maybe two dozen or so) has told me it helped them immensely. <br />This book is for white-knuckle flyers.

A lot of people, if one reads the previous reviews, see this as a novel of male friendship and bonding.  I do not see it that way at all.  Rather, I see it as a novel about men who are congenital loners trying to break out and find a meaningful relationship--unfortunately without success.  That failure seriously undermines the premise of the novel.<br />Dr. Verghese, the author and narrator (although cited as fiction the book obviously is heavily autobiographical) and a fourth-year medical student named David Smith, encounter one another while working at the local teaching hospital in El Paso, Texas.  Both are in the midst of breakups in their marital/significant other relationships and desperate for some sort of trusting, stable emotional bond.  When they discover a mutual love of tennis-David has had limited semi-pro experience, Verghese has been enamored with the game all his life as an escape mechanism from his childhood loneliness-the basis is found for the beginning of the development of a relationship.<br />Both bring substantial emotional baggage to the relationship.  It develops that David is a \\"recovered\\" drug addict.  Verghese, stigmatized by his minority status and unable to relate to anyone except through very limiting roles (patient, neighbor, boss) is divorcing and managing it very badly.  That the relationship seems to work at all is due to the role reversal it requires-David, the student and receiver of medical knowledge becomes the teacher of tennis wisdom and Verghese the receiver of same.<br />This is a deep, complex & ambitious book that fails.  It fails because the central story, the relationship between David and Verghese never really exists-they never truly bond on an emotional level at any point.  By the end we are supposed to be moved by the somehow deeply moving effect David has had on everyone in sight-Verghese, David's women, the other hospital folks, the local addict community and, presumably, the reader.  Yet the man never really, at any point, truly touches anyone in the book at any sort of human level.<br />There are worthwhile elements to the book.  One does get a genuine feel for what teaching hospital life is like.  Also, one gets a feel for what life in El Paso, Texas, a very unusual community I like a lot, it like.  Verghese's love for tennis is genuine and his prose about the sport is almost poetic.  There are little historical snippets-mini biographical pieces, really-about the lives and quirks of some of tennis' great players that are interesting and informative.  And, finally, Verghese is a gifted writer with an engaging and riveting writing voice.<br />In the end, I was really disappointed, though I was glad I read the book.  But, the failure to deliver a convincing central story left this as much less of a book than it could have been.	2002-03-13

The Giver related the story of Jonas, a child growing up in a world where \\"sameness\\" is the order of the day.  All actions, events and behaviors are well defined and regulated by \\"the leaders\\".   The \\"leaders\\" believe they have created a Utopian society of general comfort and well-being, good health and absence of fear. <br />The fact remains, however, that this is nevertheless a human society and there are complications.  The basic animal urges of the human species must be managed. There are \\"communities\\" beyond this one's border with different practices and customs.  There are unforeseen events to be dealt with.  There are old technologies and practices that must be avoided to maintain sameness.  How to do that is managed through the office of The Receiver of Memory, a lonely and solitary member of the community who has been imprinted with all the historical, emotional and other human \\"memories\\" that need to be kept alive (for those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, a scenario definitely not in the game plan for this community).  He is a figure of great respect within the community whose role is to use his memories to advise the \\"leaders' in times of crisis and/or confusion.<br />Jonas' world is turned upside down when he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory.  He not only experiences the pain and grief of all the long forgotten, yet stored memories-grief, starvation, war, hate and so on-but also learns the cruel tradeoffs and the intrinsic hypocrisy that the \\"leader\\" engage in to maintain their Utopian society.  And as he continues to train, Jonas eventually is faced with a situation that forces him to choose whether he personally can be part of the hypocrisy and deception that maintains that system.<br />A thoughtful, well written, extraordinarily moving story with lovingly created characters, the Giver is a book that can-and will-offer philosophical challenges to readers of any age.<br />One of the best books for younger adolescents I've ever read.	2002-03-12

Hi is an author from the old school of writing-the one where the term \\"literature\\" had specific connotations, such as a mastery of language, characterization, plot and scene.  In other words, these are books for the introspective and contemplative reader, not someone who reads for light entertainment.<br />The Magus is by far Fowles most controversial work.  It is an deeply suspenseful  novel of overt psychological and sexual bondage and sadism.  The general outlines of the plot don't seem that gruesome-a young Englishman, fleeing an unsuccessful relationship, takes on a teaching assignment on a remote Greek Island and befriends a wealthy resident of that locale.  But this is no ordinary fellow, He's a sociopath of a very disturbing type and he slowly ensnares the young Englishman into a web of psychotic manipulation and deceit.<br />The suspense level is high, the emotional distress level is intense-this is a wrenching book.  The meek and easily offended would be wise to seek refuge elsewhere.<br />Fowles is a master writer and this is his masterwork.  Serious students of literature ought to read this book.  It will not just challenge you-it will change you.  Isn't that what real literature is supposed to do?	2002-03-11

I'm not quite sure exactly what universe it is that Julien Barnes inhabits, but I must say that it is an unusually interesting place to visit.  Having been blown away by another of the authors books-Flaubert's Parrot-I decided to try another of his novels to see if the substance and style of that books could be repeated.<br />It turns out repetition is not one of Mr. Barnes apparent life goals.  In The History of the World in 10 ½ Chapters Mr. Barnes once again blows me away in a manner absolutely at odds with, but just as mesmerizing, as Flaubert's Parrot.<br />If Barnes has one unifying aspect to his novels it's that he can take the arcane  and use it as a window to the world.  In Flaubert's Parrot, the oddity of the  parrot became a metaphor for the oddity that was Flaubert.  In History of the World, Mr..Barnes latches onto an array of arcane and esoteric symbols to both analyze an historical epoch while concomitantly questioning the validity of historical analysis, within various arenas,  itself.  It's a nifty trick, an enlightening exercise, an entertaining expedition of epic proportions.<br />One of the particularly interesting elements of Barnes style is his ability to tackle \\"heavy\\" topics in a straightforward, serious yet light-handed manner that allows for the flow of the ideas, the flow of the text, and the flow of the story (or, in this case, stories) to march on without getting bogged down.<br />The man possesses a highly inventive and creative mind, a very off beat view of the world, an admirable craftsmanship with language and a very dry, very British tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.  It all adds up to a splendid reading experience.<br />This is a truly novel novel!	2002-03-11

Exodus is a classic example of the very popular school of Epic Historical Fiction that was extremely popular in the 1950's and 1960's,  as exemplified by folks like Uris and James A. Michener.<br />(The key phrase here is \\"fiction\\".  This is a distinction apparently lost on many of the reviewers of this book, who want to analyze the \\"historical accuracy\\" or \\"prejudice\\" of the book.  This is a novel and was never intended nor sold as an apolitical historical text.  It would be nice if we could all just judge a book as a book and not always convert the process into an exercise in political activism and/or resentment but, alas, that no longer seems possible in our world.)<br />A novel about the birth of Israel as rendered through the viewpoints of a cast of characters, this is an emotionally charged and gripping book.  The scope of the story is grand-there are many, many flashbacks that delineate the heritage and developmental context of virtually all the main, and many of the more important secondary, characters.  These tales are meant to be both representation as well as allegorical and are effective on both scores.<br />Make no mistake-this is a book that celebrates the \\"heroic struggle\\" to birth a nation in the face of overwhelming odds in an environment of rabid hostility.  The treatment of the \\"story\\" of the Arabs and Palestinians is truncated and shortchanged.  This is not to say that what is there is not accurate-it's to say not all of their story is told as the other story is told.<br />The book is engrossing and inspiring.  I first read it at the age of 12 many, many years ago when I was laid up in the hospital after reconstructive orthopedic surgery.  After reading it I was possessed to desert my family and go join in this epic struggle.  The fact I was 12 and in traction prevented that sort of thing, but you get the idea.  Having recently reread the book, I am almost as inspired today as I was then.  Of course, I now read the book with a much more distinctive and sophisticated sensibility as to the uneven socio-historical shortcomings of the text.  Are they real?  Yes.  Does it matter?  No, not if you recognize the work for the fictional work it is and don't mistake it for something else.<br />This is a wonderful tale told in a stirring and compelling manner.  It remains at the apex of its genre.  Read this if you want to be moved and entertained.  Scour the non-fiction list if you want to argue Middle Eastern Politics.	2002-03-11

I read it with great anticipation.  I tend to like Asian-American authors and fine the retelling of their struggles bridging their family and cultural life with their American experience enlightening and entertaining.  And, truth be told, this story probably had a lot to offer on that score.  <br />However, in the end I found the book extremely disappointing, primarily because the main character is such a spineless wimp.  I spent the entire book wanting to yell \\"Grow up you jerk!\\"  It's been a long time since I have experienced so useless and loathsome a character.  Had he been even halfway decent I probably could have gotten into the story.  As it was I was so filled with pity for all these poor characters stuck forever in the same pages as this greedy, immature twerp that I lost track of the story entirely.<br />What's really frustrating is David Wong Louie can write.  And the most impressive aspect of his writing is the depth and intensity of his characters. It's too bad he wasted so much effort on such a fine cast only to undermine it all in the end with such a lousy main character.<br />I can only hope his next effort is better constructed so that the story is allowed to emerge and be enjoyed.	2002-03-11

I was extremely disappointed with this book.  <br />This is Bill Fitzhugh's first novel.  My hope is the man will corral his extraordinary talent to much better effect.  The book has wonderful characters. It has an interesting and intricate plot with loads of potential, and it's clear that Mr. Fitzhugh has a genuinely active sense of the absurd.  <br />The problem is, none of this ever gels into a real story line that works.  I kept waiting for the promised hilarity-it never appeared.  Fundamentally, I think the problem is that this is a farce, plain and simple, but the author wanted to have a real sense of reality underlining the story, which seriously undermined the farcical aspects of the story.  In the end, it's neither truly farcical nor anything remotely realistic-it's just silly and contrived.  And, ultimately, boring.  By the end Mr. Fitzhush has introduced so many assassins that one needs a dance card to keep them all straight.  It's all very frustrating.<br />In actuality this book deserves a one star rating-I'm giving it two because the potential for real success is so visible.

His epic (this puppy is over 1000 pages long) writing style is definitely on display here though the overall construction of the book is unusual for Michener.  The story starts with a \\"modern\\" day archeological dig (circa 1950).  We are exposed to a range of relics of various types and ages dug up by the archeologists.  There are 12 in all.  The book then tells the \\"historical\\" tale surrounding each piece-12 stories.  So, in essence, this is in reality a book of 12 interconnected and interrelated short stories-more novella's, really-- with a prolog and post-log involving the archeological dig.<br />Being an early effort and given it's unusual structure vis-&agrave;-vis Michener's traditional style the book lacks some of the elements of structure and style that so characterize Michener's later works-specifically, this book lacks the overall story line and continuity that characterize later efforts.  On the whole I think this is actually a positive.  A lot of Michener's books seem to weigh me down as I read them-the structure seems at times more important than the story and the stories so overblown as to be beyond the ken of merely mortal readers.  Those aspects are absent here despite the books length.  And while they book is more or less short stories/novellas, they are sufficiently detailed and expansive that interest is maintained but not abused.<br />The work is dated.  While there is a sense that Michener was making a real effort to be apolitical and historically accurate, the fact is that the book nevertheless reflects the underlying predispositions of the time.  I suspect if he were around to undertake this effort now the book would have a somewhat different flavor.  This fac tin no way detracts from the viability nor the vitality of the stories, however.<br />On the whole, while this probably can't be adjudged Micheners best work from a technical or literary standpoint, I think it's his best work from readability and enjoy ability standpoint.

A club for canines called-what else???--The Doghouse, a place where a fellow can relax and really let his ears down, so to speak.  <br />A whimsical, hilarious book that the entire family can and will enjoy!	2002-03-08

Two Steps Ahead of the Thought Police is a compilation of 5 years of  John Leo's US News &amp; World Report columns.<br />While it would be fair to describe Mr. Leo as a curmudgeonly columnist it must be pointed out he is one with a sense of perspective almost as developed as his sense of humor.  Basically conservative in outlook, he nonetheless is quite capable of skewering conservative viewpoints and policy right along with liberal viewpoints and policy.  And so Mr. Leo can criticize the left's propensity to foster \\"the victimization of America\\" propensity while also criticize the rights propensity to want to censor everything under the sun.<br />While this is in a way a wide ranging collection in terms of presentation and writing style, it is fairly narrowly focus in terms of subject matter, allowing for a fairly thorough look at the topics at hand from a variety of aspects.  This also gives the work more coherence and a better, more novelistic pacing than is usual for works of this sort.<br />I don't always agree with Leo, but he seldom fails to raise good, thoughtful points in his commentary and he never fails to entertain. Who says you can't have it all?<br />This book represents a really refreshing breath of very fresh air in a genre that seems to have devolved into a morass of invective, hostility and bile as substitutes for commentary and debate.<br />A great read!	2002-03-08

Red Ray, the central character in this tremendous first novel by Michelle Huneven, was a thriving West Coast lawyer with a glamorous and ambitious wife--until she dumped him for being a drunk, and until he himself ended up nearly dead, thrown from a car wreck during a booze-driven tour of the southwest. ``Red Ray,'' says Huneven, ``rose from that curb a sober man.''<br />Round Rock is a story about a group of memorable people who, like Red Ray, have hit bottom and are trying to rise back up.  It sounds like it ought to be a depressing story-it's anything but.  Hunevan has an ability to dispassionately create characters with major league flaws you cannot just relate to, but embrace.  The ability to empathize with these people is key because, being on the down and out and, often, in denial about it, there are problems galore.  There are also compassionate, realistic people around to help them get through them and back into the light.<br />This is a book about the power of love and hope told in a matter of fact manner that actually accentuates the warmth and love that make personal redemption possible.<br />I stumbled on to this book, have given it to several folks as gifts, and every single one of them has loved it. I think the vast majority of people will.<br />The only disappointment I have is that Huenven has never written another book.  After reading Round rock, you'll wish she had a full catalog of choices to read through.  Alas, such is not the case, so enjoy this one to the hilt.	2002-03-07

One of the basic behavior patterns ofd the toddler class is what my child psychologist neighbor so charmingly calls \\"anthropomorphic objectification\\", by which she means finding some aspect of an object comforting in the same way mom is comforting as an object and using is as an acceptable \\"mom\\" substitute.  So we have favorite blankets, favorite bears, favorite cars--whatever.<br />This is a book about this process.  Owen the mouse loves Easter and gets an Easter basket full of goodies, each of which he proclaims to be his \\"favorite\\" as he gobbles it up-except for his little yellow candy chick, which is the same color as his favorite blanket. Owen proceeds to act out kids \\"cherishing\\" behavior, finally kissing the chick goodnight.<br />The book seems to strike a chord with both parents and kids.  I imagine it's because it's a behavior we all recognize, indulge in and identify with, and that fact seems to help us foster a fondness for Owen above and beyond that his intrinsic charm and cuteness engender on their own.<br />Good story, great illustrations, nice hardboard format is good for the toddler group who like to carry around and \\"play\\" with their books as much as actually have them read to them.<br />This is evolving into a very good series.	2002-03-06
US	53013845	R237E9T8IWKT3Z	0805054073	164241000	Timbuktu	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Intriguing concept but not up to Auster's usual standards.	This book examines the issue of homelessness from the point of view of the protagonist's dog, Mr. Bones.  Will G. Christmas is a mildly schizophrenic, alcoholic man who's been out on he street's for about 4 years as the book opens.  Aware that he is seriously ill, Wilily is trying g to locate an old teacher of his who once tried to encourage his writing to take his collected poems and look after his dog.<br />Willy's descent is delineated in a series of retrospective snapshots interspersed with the current adventures of Willy and Mr. Bones on the road.<br />The concept of liking at homelessness in this way is interesting-seeing Willy's plight from the dispassionate perspective if Mr. Bones is instructive and insightful-but this takes up just over half the book.  Willy expires &amp; Mr. Bones is on his own, subsequently passes between a succession of temporary owners until the end of the book.<br />There are two major problems with the book.  One, there's only so much you can do with a mildly schizophrenic, alcoholic street person's character, a flaw Auster seems to recognize as he dispatches Willy relatively early in the book.  The second is that, while the subsequent adventures of Mr. Bones post Willy may be realistic, they add nothing to the major premise of the novel.  That there are a lot of lonely people in the world other than street people may be a valid observation (and that seems to be the message of the second part of the book) this narrative says nothing either about homeless or loneliness for that matter, after Willy departs the scene.<br />I think Auster would have been better served either by creating a cast of homeless characters and providing a series of stories about the descent into loneliness &amp; homelessness that could have supported a whole novel or simple cut this down to short story or novella format.<br />So, while I read the book and appreciated it for what it tried to do, as a Auster fan I have to say I was pretty disappointed overall.	2002-03-06

This Immortal is a novel set on post-apocalyptic Earth sometime well into the future.  The Earth's total population is around 4 million souls-an apt term as a sizable portion of those left are \\"mutants\\" of on sort or another. Conrad Nomikos, the protagonist of the novel has a particularly interesting mutation-he's several hundred years old and, insofar as he can tell, an immortal.<br />The bulk of the population wasn't killed off in the war-they've emigrated to other planets.  What few choice locations are left on earth are owned by an alien race-the Vegans-much despised by those left on the planet.<br />Nomikos \\"leads\\" a movement called the Returnist's-folks who want people to move back so that earthlings can reclaim their planet from the Vegans.  \\"Leads\\" is in quotes as Conrad would rather be sailing and, while he actually sympathizes with Returnist goals in general, he nevertheless has very ambivalent feeling about the Vegans in general.<br />Pressed into service as a guide for a very influential Vegan touring the planet, Conrad is buffeted by several forces pulling at him in different directions.  Not sure what's going on, he set's out to try to keep the Vegan alive while he tries to get at what he's up to.  Needless to say, from here on out the stuff is pretty much always hitting the fan, so to speak.<br />This was Zelazny's first major novel. It is a truly great concept and the overall execution is well done-but it is a first effort.  The characterizations are uneven. The story rambles a bit in places, the ending's a bit weak.  Nevertheless, the genius that would later dominate the sci-fi world is clearly in evidence here, and my opinion is that to truly appreciate Zelazny's place in sci-fi history, you absolutely need to start here.  It wont be his best work you'll read, but it is an essential work.  And, on the whole, it's still a classic and a very good story.	2002-03-06
US	53013845	R2G0TOR0JWYVD4	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	2	3	N	N	An exploratory look at John Adams-vintage McCullough.	Biographies break down into two basic categories--exploratory narratives and explanatory narratives.  This book is the former, a general--and altogether excellent--exploration of Adam's life and accomplishments. This seems to be the fitting choice when faced with Adams, one of those historical figures we all know of but know darn little about. This situation has more to do with Adams unfortunate juxtaposition between Washington and Jefferson in terms of his presidential stint as well as Hamilton's more celebrated role in the earlier Constitutional Convention process rather than any particular shortcomings in terms of either his accomplishments or the dynamics of his personal history.  This being the case, McCullough obviously decided the exploratory approach--and informative rather than an inquisitive work--was a better choice for this effort.  It was the right choice.<br />The book fortunately avoids some of the typical pitfalls of a McCullough biography.  His works can be a bit turgid in terms of the prose and are often a bit too monumental in their scope, flaws that marks such works as Truman and Path Between the Seas.  This book is much more in line with the author's best efforts, such as Mornings on Horseback.<br />Adams is certainly an extremely important figure in early American history and clearly there was a serious need for an excellent expository look at his life and accomplishments.  We are in debt to Mr. McCullough for producing just such a work.<br />This is a truly excellent book.	2002-03-06

Like Van Allsburg, his books are highly creative and imaginative, the story is absorbing and entertaining, and, quite apart from all that, the illustrations are in a class of their own-stark and startling yet warm and accessible.<br />The Three Little pigs starts out as the classic story but then diverts down a very different, utterly delightful path before returning-sort of-to the traditional ending.  The work, taken as a whole, is captivating and engrossing for child and adult alike.  And, finally, like all great children's fiction, this is the sort of book one does not tire of-you are always ready to dive in yet once again with as great a sense of anticipation as when you tried it the first time.<br />I consider Van Allsburg's Polar Express and Jumanji to be among the best children's books ever produced. This book is in both that mold and of that class of effort.<br />A truly awesome book the whole family will enjoy for years to come.	2002-03-06

Richard Hooker's primary aim in writing MASH was to vividly capture the essence of what being a MASH surgeon was really all about.  The book provides a lot of information about how these guys came to be MASH doctors, how the ARMY supported them-and how the ARMY failed to support them, and what the experience was like from the doctors perspective as a surgeon as well as a man, not part of the \\"regular army\\" but [pushed] into it involuntarily.<br />Is this an antiwar book?  Yes, in a way.  <BR>It is an antiwar book to the extent that, through it's depictions of the results of modern warfare, it conveys true disgust with both war in general and the way the military handles its troops and soldiers.  The antiwar message is more subtle than explicit.<br />Is it a mad-cap comedy?  Yes, in a way.  <br />The fact is that hooker uses comedy as one of many tools to convey the extreme conditions-of climate, of workload, of inexperience, of loneliness, of sheer terror-that affected the MASH surgeons experience during the Korean War as well as their responses to those conditions. Thrust, usually against their will, into situations often beyond their ken, in an organizational structure they neither respect or truly understand, the behavior of many was, at best, aberrant as opposed to their true natures.  This perforce leads to inherently comic situations. Add that to the normal Army SNAFU culture (Situation Normal-All Fouled UP), and the recipe for comedy is auspicious...<br />The book remains a very viable stand alone experience.<br />If you are a fan of either or both the movie and TV series, I seriously recommend reading the book,  It elevates the whole MASH experience to a new and more holistically satisfying level.	2002-03-04

The chart the adventures of Ms. Frizzle and her class as they go on some really interesting field trips.<br />The books operate on several levels.  They work as adventure stories as the manner in which they get diverted from an ordinary school field trip to the adventure at hand is always entertaining.  The illustrations are truly wonderful and add to the story line very effectively. The books do in fact contain a lot of basic information about the topic at hand, so your kids are actually learning something as they read. And, as a final bonus, the books always involve some sore of class socialization issue, so your kids are exposed to some real life classroom issue, (here it's a Miss know-it-all type) and strategies for dealing with them as well.  On top of all that, the books are just plain fun.<br />A great series for late pre-schoolers and early elementary age kids.  So, what are you waing for?

This arises from his ability to develop strong, uniqe characters, his deft craftsmanship, a tremendous feel for suspense, and some sort of technical a subject background that provides a general focus for the whole story.<br />In this case, that background is photography.<br />Phillip Nore is a long time jockey who dabbles in amateur photography.   When a well known but little liked professional racing photographer is killed in a car crash, Nore eventually, accidentally, comes into possession of the man's body of work and records.  Suddenly Nore and those close to him a being subjected to break-in's in their home, apparently random attacks and so on.  Nore comes to understand that the records and negatives he holds are the source of the trouble.  He begins looking into the photographers past, and finds a nasty surprise indeed.  The question is, can he get to the bottom of this mess before he gets killed?<br />This work is unusually strong for a Francis novel on several fronts.  Phillip is a particularly strong character even for Francis-much more intellectual and introspective than is the norm.  The technical aspects of photography needed to decipher the situation are expertly presented in an informative and non-intrusive way that takes nothing from the story-indeed, they add to it.  And, the romantic aspect is unusually strong and well developed for a Francis novel as well.<br />On the whole, this is not only one of the best Francis novels I've read-it's pne of the best overall suspense novels as well.<br />Get yourself into the \\"picture':  read this book!	2002-03-04

Blue Bossa is the story of Ronnie Reboulet, a down and out former jazz musician on the comeback trail.<br />A former addict who has been cleaned up and more or less rehabilitated by the woman he's living with, Ronnie hasn't played at all in over five years when the book opens.  His estranged daughter, with a grandson in tow, arrives on the scene with the ambition of becoming a singer.  Drawn back into the world of music, Ronnie starts playing again, hooks up with a young local musician, and is back in the groove. Unfortunately, the groove leads him back to the addictions that got him in trouble in the first place.<br />The book consists of a long series of short, feisty passages portraying his relationship with both his daughter and lover interspersed with a series of flashbacks to his youth working with the greats of the jazz scene of the 1960's and 1970's.  These retrospective scenes provide a lively look into that scene and are both extremely informative as well as emmenintly entertaining given the characters involved.<br />Ultimately it all comes together for Ronnie-and then proceeds to once again fall apart.<br />A novel about the power of love-and it's limitations-the power of music and the source of artistic inspiration, this is a beautiful, heartfelt little gem of a novel any jazz fan is sure to love.	2002-03-04

The Collector Collector is tols from the perspective of a 5000 year old bowl that has seen it all.  \\"People do things in front of me that they'd never dream of doing in front of their pets\\" informs the rather droll, articulate, somewhat cynical bowl. After revealing a few examples, we are ready to forgive the cynicism.  <br />The title is a word play.  The stories are all about the various owner/collectors of the object in question, which the bowl considers to be a string of collections of its own.<br />The story opens with the bowl currently in the hands of Rosa, a romantically desperate young Londoner who works for an auction agency that has acquired the piece and is estimating and appraising it, a job that falls to Rose.  Rosa is a perfect fit for the task as she possesses some latent extrasensory capabilities that allow her to sense the bowls stories and experiences, which both stimulate and distract her.  The primary distraction is from Nikki, her temporary roommate who is a psycho maniac slowly stealing Rosa blind behind her back.<br />This book is not quite up to Fischer's usual standards, and that is, I believe, a matter of a fault in construction.  Fischer never seems to be sure if this is a novel or a book of short stories with a theme.  As a result, the narrative exists somewhere in between and this leads to some awkwardness and disjointedness throughout the text.<br />That criticism notwithstanding, the book nevertheless provides considerable pleasure simple by allowing us to share once again in Fischer's somewhat skewed and cosmically comic world view.  The man may not always be polished but he is always funny.<br />On the whole, a pleasant diversion but not even close to Fischer at his best.	2002-03-04

Oh, really?) and the spiritual equivalent of better-than-market returns with virtually no pain, no effort and no need for introspection, piety or, indeed, any real expression of faith?<br />H. L.

First of all, it has a very positive love message for fathers and sons, not all that common a theme in children's books.  Secondly, the sort of \\"one-ups-man-ship\\" theme is on that naturally appeals to kids that age.  The story itself is sweet without being cloying, and the illustrations are first rate.<br />A great book for older pre-schoolers.  As has been noted in many previous reviews, reading the book seems to stimulate a \\"how much do you love me\\" game with the kids and parents who read the book a lot.  Given that the desire to be loved is one key need at this age group, a book that stimulates you to talk and play with your child in a way that distinctly communicates your love for him/her has got to be a good thing.<br />This is one of those books your kid's will grow out of before you do-much to your sorrow.<br />I highly recommend it.	2002-03-03

Harold's adventure is one where one things move together quickly in a not necessarily logical, but highly imaginative sequence.  <br />Also, Harold is the one in control-an aspect that I think also really appeals to kids.  Everything in the story appears solely by virtue of Harold employing his imagination to his surrounding.  Isn't that essentially that a 4 years olds play pattern is most of the time?<BR>That it is a sweet and fun tale only adds to the enjoyment.<br />A great book that your kids will have you reading to them over and over again.	2002-03-03

This is Kathleen Tyau's second novel about life in post WW II Hawaii.  Like it's predecessor, A Little Too Much is Enough, it conveys a sense of what life in Hawaii was like foe the native, local Hawaiians through the eyes and experiences of one family.  <br />This is a much more expansive book than it predecessor.  It introduces elements of the impact of mainland society into the picture through expatriate's returning home for a visit, providing for a comparative look at shared memories that begin in Hawaii during World War II and continue to a present in the 1970s from divergent viewpoints.<br />Alice's best friend, Annabel Lee, is coming back to Maui after years in Florida, but she has been preceded by her son, Wick, who is romancing Alice's daughter. Alice is beside herself with the preparations of Annabel's return and flooded with memories of their lives growing up together at St. Andrew's Priory after the war.  As if all this weren't enough, Alice's daughter has announced she's broken up with her husband and is now seeing Annabel's son after a visit to their family in Florida.<br />Like it's predecessor, this is a book rich in detail and evocative of a time past that not too many people really know about.  It stands as both a fascinating character study and history lesson as well.<br />On the whole this is a better written and more sophisticated book than A Little Too Much, but I thought the earlier effort was a better story as it captured much more effectively the spiritual and mystical side of native Hawaiian culture, which is almost totally absent from this effort.  Nonetheless, both are excellent and I would recommend either in a heartbeat.	2002-03-02

Free to do whatever he wants thanks to a family inheritance he specializes in ephemeral relationships high in sensual satisfaction and bereft of emotional attachment.  Unfortunately, Will's having difficulties maintaining his life style as all his mates are growing up-getting married, having kids, taking some sort of stab at responsibility.<br />Will alights on the notion of participating in a single-parent's get together as a means of meeting new romantic possibilities-and has some success.  Unfortunately for Will, these single parents all seem to have children that become part of the equation-particularly Marcus, a fatherless lad in need of some guidance, who attaches himself to Will like a leech.  <br />This is when the fun really begins.<br />No contemporary author has as firm-and comical-an insight into the idiosyncrasies and absurdities of the male psyche.  The great fun in Hornby's novels is how much of yourself (and your friends) you see in them.  Are we all really this weird?  Yes, we are.  And Hornby has the knack for hitting the nail on the head in the manner most likely to to get the most humor out of the situation possible.<br />This book isn't quite in the same league as High Fidelity, the author's previous work, but it is darn close. <br />An excellent and amusing read.	2002-03-02

This keeps him constantly on the road pursuing his real occupation-looking for the man who he believes is responsible for his parent's deaths so as to extract revenge.<br />The book is full of irony-Erwin exploits his religion and his fellow Jews for his living to pursue an avocation not altogether consistent with his religion's message of tolerance and forgiveness.  He is constantly mistaken for a non-Jew and subjected to rabid anti-Semitic rants of his other passengers whom he also tries to exploit to fine his nemesis. And so on.<br />Applefeld is an Israeli citizen who writes in Hebrew.  Even translated, the pace and mannerisms of the translation yield a sense of authenticity and Old World feel to the text.  His prose is concise and spare-yet emotional and evocative at the same time.  It all adds up to a very unique and original writing voice.<br />This is not a happy book-it is stressful, haunting and depressing.  It is also insightful and compelling reading.  You will finish exhausted and emotionally drained.  If that's your cup of tea, then this is your novel.	2002-03-02

The story revolves around the efforts of the narrator-who is never named-to sell her engagement ring after her engagement goes south in a most unusual fashion--at the last minute her fiancé decides to become a priest.  Still living with her parents, her efforts bring an unusual string of prospective buyers into the household to view the merchandise.  The stories of the potential buyers affords our narrator to reflect upon both her failed engagement as well as her life in general.<br />There are aspects to the novel I really enjoyed.  Having been raised Catholic in an ethnic neighborhood in a major city, the book brought back many memories of my youth. The family in the novel mirrors many a family I knew as a kid-the cold, reserved world of \\"proper\\" Catholicism where what the neighbors might think was often the arbiter of taste and behavior above all other considerations, the lack of emotional engagement, and so on came through as real and genuine attributes to a specific way of life many will know.  And Shea does a good job effectively presenting the spiritual and emotional anguish and pain such a prim, proper, straight-laced existence can engender among its inhabitants.<br />So, there is a lot to like about this book.  However, I felt a bit disappointed with the book in the end.  I think the failure to name and identify the narrator as a person was a mistake as I never had a real sense of her as a complete person and, frankly, felt a bit of the cold detachment towards her that her parents and so much of her family was depicted as displaying.  Which is not the way it ought to be.  One wants to embrace and fully empathize with this poor woman, but that isn't quite possible.  And that's too bad, for, in the end, this error of execution leaves the reader with a sort of cognitive and emotional dissonance that obscures the enjoyment of the novel to a significant degree.<br />But, that's just me.  I can see from previous reviews that such is not the case for many readers, and maybe I'm the exception. However, quite a few folks have dissed the book and I think they may have very well felt as I do-it's hard to really like a book where you can't feel a real connection to the main protagonist-especially when you year for that connection.<br />But that's still clearly a minority viewpoint. I think most readers will in the end like the book quite a lot.	2002-03-01
US	53013845	R31BKNCT0SEN0A	0340424354	973035473	Mysteries of Pittsburgh	Books	3	28	32	N	N	Not as good as the hype-but not that bad, either.	Everybody has to start somewhere, and Michael Chabon, who has developed into a first class author, started out with Mysteries of Pittsburgh.<br />A first novel by a very young author, this book was highly acclaimed at it's release, winning several major awards, and generating accolades to Chabon that compared him to the likes of J. D. Salinger, Mark Twain and so on.<br />All the hype and awards might seem a bit much in retrospect, as this is not a world class novel either in terms of the writing or the concept.  However, it is probably best to remember the time in which it was released-1988-and if you look at the book in the context of those times.  That was a time when the fear arising from the confusion and ignorance and politicizing of AIDS were at their height, and the literati no doubt latched onto this honest and angst filled appraisal of the road to personal understanding of alternative sexuality as much for the social vales of the text as much as-if not more than-for it's intrinsic artistic value.<br />It's not a bad book, but the craftsmanship with words, style and execution pale compared to some of Chabon's later work.  That being said, there are nevertheless long sections where the emerging talent is very much on display and the reading quite enjoyable.<br />I found many of the characters other than Art to be a bit too stereotypish  but, then again, this is a first novel and that's not an altogether phenomenon for the first time author.<br />In the end I was glad I read the book.  It did lead me on to other Cahbon works, and that has proven to be a very pleasant journey.  My guess is that if you approach this with the expectation you are reading a first effort and don't get too bogged down in the hype and overheated reviews on both sides, you'll end up glad you gave it a go as well.	2002-03-01

Usually these are character driven books-there can be a distinct lack of action in what is admittedly a more cerebral series than is the norm in this genre.  However, this book features a very complex plot with a multitude of characters and lots of actions.  And, while character may indeed take a rare second place to plot, the fact is the characters are all nevertheless well developed and intriguing in their own right, so nothing is lost on that score.<br />Moreover, it is a genuine classic Nero Wolfe story in that the interplay between Wolfe and his intrepid assistant-Archie Goodwin is as good as it gets in the series.  The story also makes use of the full ledger of periodic regulars to the series, another plus.<br />All in all it adds up to a great story and one of the best books in this large series of work.  <br />A great read from a great series. If you like Wolfe, you MUST read this one.	2002-02-28

That they are truly loved.  And that is the message of this book.  The story, such as it is, is not all that complicated--throughout a boy's life his mother is there-admittedly, in some contexts, in some off the wall ways--to tell her son she loves him--totally, deeply, forever.  By the end, the woman is very old, the son is a man, and he is rocking his elderly mother and telling her--he loves her--deeply, totally and forever.<br />After reading all these \\"this book is creepy\\" reviews I gave the book to my 20 year old son and 16 year old daughter and said \\"Remember this book?  What do you think of it now\\" and both said they still liked it and that it made them cry. (Actually son said it's a tear-jerker but sweet, and I'm translating that, but you get the picture)<br />Don't let the Nay Sayers sway you from this title.<br />To all those who think it's \\"creepy\\", I suggest you consider whether the problem resides within the book or within your own hearts.	2002-02-28

Tony Hillerman has created an extraordinary series with his tales of crime on the Navajo Reservations of New Mexico.  <br />The books are unique for a number of reasons.  The first is that there are two main characters, Joe Leaphorn, a senior investigator in the Navajo Police Force, and Jim Chee, the equivalent of a \\"patrolman\\" on the force.  In some books, both make appearances, in some only on of them is on the scene.<br />Then there is the fact that Hillerman genuinely knows about both the nature and history of the Navajo Nation, both past and present.  This lends an aura of authenticity and credibility to the novels that is consistently present throughout the series. <br />On top of all that, Hillerman understands and can effectively convey a realistic projection of actual criminal process and procedure.<br />Finally, Hillerman is able to portray the cultural dissonance that marks life on and around the reservation, both within the tribe as well as with relations of the tribe to the larger community without indulging in any sort of editorializing that would detract from the tale.  <br />This was the first Hillerman novel I read, and while not quite up to the standards of his very best work, it's close.  The story revolves around the plundering of Navajo burial treasures and an associated murder.<br />But, like all the Hillerman novels, it's not the details of the story that count-it's Hillerman's ability to transport us to another world within our world and make us at home there while telling a great story in a realistic and truly believable fashion.<br />If you have not treated yourself to some of the Navajo Nation series, you are really missing out on a real treat.	2002-02-28

The book reviews the events of 9.11 and looks at their impact on the nation primarily through it's impact on the victims and those who responded to the events.  <br />The book works on the one hand as, is often the case with the Life books of this genre, the photography is excellent and well scaled.  There is enough to convey the impact and scope of the attacks without engendering sensory overload.  The use of a news ticker like format in the photo section is effective in that it provides identification  and context sufficient to the need without detracting from the power of the photography.<br />The best part of the book, however, is the second half which is basically broken into three parts:  A section that concentrates on the victims in the planes and buildings, a section that concentrates on those who responded to the events, and a third sort of Big picture/Summary section.<br />The vignettes in the second half show the wider impact and effect of the events, as well as the national, racial and ethnic diversity of the victims and those who responded. The stories are long enough to get the picture of individual circumstances and numerous enough to communicate the scale of the tragedy without overwhelming the emotional senses to much.<br />My wife gave me this for Christmas and I went through it pretty thoroughly then and have returned to look over it in snippets from time to time since.  A lot is going on now with the war on terrorism and the return, somewhat, to politics as normal on a national stage and going back for a peak serves to remind what sacrifices are needed and necessary.  This book communicates the big picture and if there is one thing we cannot do at this point, it's lose track of the big picture.	2002-02-28

As is the norm for Boyle, this is a very complex work.<br />The gist of this novel emerges right from the start.  Delaney Mossbacher is driving home to his pristine gated community in Southern California and hits a Mexican immigrant walking along the road.  His reaction?  Concern that he might have seriously damaged his car.  Oh, he does \\"come to his senses\\" and check on the man he hit.  The man is obviously injured.  What does Delaney do?  Gives him 20 bucks and leaves.<br />Ok, so Delaney is just a lousy jerk-a bad guy with no conscience, right?  Not exactly, at least from Delaney's point of view.  A left wing \\"naturalist\\" type, Delaney is the perfect parody of the \\"Socially and Environmentally\\" conscious Yuppie urban American. He's the sort with \\"important\\" cares.  That he has hit and injured a human being gives him but passing concern-that his dog can be killed by wild animals in his own yard is an outrage.<br />This world view is counter posed against that of the accident victim, Candido and his young wife, illegal immigrants living in the ravine behind the Delaney's gated community.  Candido and his wife struggle with how to find even one decent meal a day.  Kyra, Delaney's wife, struggles with the escalating emptiness and lack of fulfillment she feels from closing 6 figure commission deals on her sales of multimillion dollar homes.  And so it goes.<br />At heart, this is a book about how people are desperate to connect with one another while systematically shutting themselves away from everyone.  The Delaney's spend their lives shutting themselves away behind an array of both actual and metaphorical walls.  Candido and his wife are shut away by poverty and fear and racism.<br />Boyle is a craftsman with words, and he definitely knows how to construct a well-designed story.  I appreciate his work but I can't really say I like it. On the one hand, his characters too often strike me as too much a caricature-complex and well developed caricatures, to be sure, butnot characters one can empathize with. In this case, neither of the Delaney's amount to what I would call a genuine character, they are both come across  caricatures developed to represent a wide swath of American stereotypes rather than as real people.  This is sad, as their counter points-Candido and his wife, are just the opposite.  They may \\"represent\\" an immigrant stereotype, yet are developed a real characters. On the other hand, there seems to me to be something oppressive about Boyle's style-I always feel like I have an anvil on my shoulders when I read his books.  I suppose some would interpret it as a sense of \\"suspense\\", but it feels different to me, more like you are carrying the weight of all the points he wants to make all throughout the reading experience.<br />Interestingly, I still come back to Boyle.  His books weigh on me, but I can't seem to walk away from him.  I may not like them, but I do appreciate them, and they seem to have a power to attract.  It's all very odd, yet compelling.  <br />I say give him a try and see what your reaction is.	2002-02-28

This is one of the best historical biographies I've ever read, and the book does deserves high praise, but there are a few flaws--mostly arising from failing to really cover some established points.<br />The brilliance of the book is that it limits itself to Roosevelt's pre-presidential life.  The key to understanding Roosevelt in office is to understand how he came to be the man he was and, by limiting this effort to that period, the book affords the reader to contemplate the man as opposed to the president.  The fact that Roosevelt lived an utterly amazing life certainly helps, along with a writing style that approaches the novelistic without sacrificing the historic.  This allows for a lively and well paced--yet academically rigorous-- effort.<br />The flaws, such as they are, are in the academically rigorous realm.  The frustration I had with the book was it raises points of serious import about Roosevelt--even engages in some conjecture--but never really addresses them.  A case in point is Roosevelt's childhood illnesses. Many--including Morris here--speculate there may have been a significant psychological component to his childhood illnesses relating to his relationship to his quite austere and demanding father.  Obviously, if a case can be made for such a circumstance, the implications for the development of some of Roosevelt's adult attitudes and beliefs could be significant.  However, Morris raises the issue but never really deals with it.  There are a few other instances of this.  They represent the only real flaw in the book.<br />These shortcomings notwithstanding, what Morris has produced is an extraordinarily detailed yet wonderfully accessible rigorous examination of the growth and development of Roosevelt the man. This is a truly wonderful book.	2002-02-28

Gary Paulsen is a master writer insofar as the young male set goes-he has written a long series of stories that have captured the imagination of young men everywhere, from his fictional wildlife adventure tales like Hatchett to his entertaining Culpeper Adventure series, Paulsen has a knack for connecting with a young male audience.  <br />He was my son's all time favorite author growing up and, last time I visited him at college, noticed he had a copy of Hatchet on his bookshelf at school.  I asked him about it and he said something to the effect that his room didn't feel like home without it there. How many writers can affect people like that?<br />Winterdance is a bit of a departure for Paulsen.  As sott of younger male's version of Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, the book is a memoir telling the story of Paulsen's entry into the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.  Funny, sad, poignant and riveting, I read it and enjoyed it very much.  I also had my son read it and he loved it as well.  I rather suspect it's on his shelf next to Hatchett.<br />You can't really go wrong with Paulsen, but this is one of his very best works, which makes this one of the best works ever for this genre.<br />Want to help your son, nephew, whomever to love to read while making your son, nephew, whoever very happy?

MacDonald is one of the acknowledged masters of the Hard-Boiled detective genre, both with his acclaimed Travis McGee series as well as his stand alone fiction.  <br />This book marks a major departure for MacDonald-a foray into fantasy fiction.  While MacDonald has traveled well away from his home field to write this one, he brings his considerable skills for characterization and plot with him and adds a true sense of whimsy and comedy to the mix with tremendous results.<br />Kirby Winter's multimillionaire Uncle Omar has just died as this story opens.  Always a very eccentric sort of character, Omar has produced a great fortune during his lifetime-and employed Kirby, his only blood relative, to give it all away to charity.  No one really understands this, however, and vultures are circling over the supposedly rich estate. <br />Kirby is a sort of pathetic character-a bit of a wimp, really-until he gets his Uncles only real bequest-a gold watch.  However, as Kirby soon discovers, this is no ordinary watch.  It is actually a sort of time machine.  Kirby, along with a cute young thing acquired along the way, works to foil the bad guys and protect his girl as best he can.  The ensuing adventures are a true delight to behold.<br />This is superior beach fare type reading-light reading entertainment of the highest order.<br />One warning is in order-This book DOES NOT represent the norm for MacDonald, whose work is usually very gritty, dark and violent.  One would be well advised to keep this in mind if that is not your sort of thing if the later is not your cup of tea.	2002-02-28

Samrat Upadhyay's Arresting God in Kathmandu is a book of 9 short stories chronicling life in Nepal, mostly in the capital of Kathmandu.  A Nepali now living in the US and writing in English, Upadhyay's book wonderfully brings the sense and feel of Nepal to the reader in a very smooth and articulate manner-much smoother than one would imaging would result from a translation.<br />The book primarily focuses on relationships between men and women. I say relationship as most of the protagonists depicted are together via arranged marriage and it would not be accurate to call these \\"love\\" stories per se.<br />One of the best features of the novel is the fact it looks at this aspect of Nepali life from the viewpoint of a variety of social stations of  Nepali society--from the famous to the forgotten-and does an admirable job of delineating how the dictates and mores of the society burden it's people at all levels and how some are able to avoid/mitigate those effects.<br />Unfortunately, this limited focus also leads to the major weakness of the book, a somewhat repetitive mantra effect-you feel you've been here before, perhaps one too many times.  However, for the most part, the stories are well written and the characters sufficiently engaging that this is in fact a rather minor glitch in the over all context of things.<br />Nepal is currently a country in social and political upheaval-and hints of that turmoil are introduced fleetingly here and there throughout the text.  I personally would have enjoyed a bit more development along those lines as, I suspect, I, like most Americans, are limited in their knowledge of Nepal to what I've read about Mt. Everest climbing expeditions, a topic never even hinted at I this text.  For example, in The Cooking Poet we see quite clearly the poet leads a dual life-as an artist and as a political agitator.  Non of the later is developed and one imagines it could have been and the inclusion would have greatly enhanced the book without taking away at all from it overall focus.<br />However, this is an excellent first effort and, hopefully, Upadhyay will broaden his focus and bring much more breadth of Nepali society to us in as entertaining a fashion as he has brought to the arranged marriage topic.  I personally look forward to reading him again.taking away at all from it overall focus.<br />However, this is an excellent first effort and, hopefully, Upadhyay will broaden his focus and bring much more breadth of Nepali society to us in as entertaining a fashion as he has brought to the arranged marriage topic.

A Ross MacDonald is like an extremely well crafted 1950's black &amp; white noir movie.  Nothing comes through in it's true color, everything is projected in shades of gray, the action is stately yet never drags, and the characters are all vaguely threatening.<br />All of MacDonald's novels exhibit certain basic themes--tormented families, buried secrets that fester through multiple generations, environmental destruction, and the brutal contrast between rich and poor.  The key to MacDonald's long running success was Archers realism and authenticity, MacDonald's ability to craft complex yet understandable stories, his mastery of language, and his ability to generate a specific atmosphere of threatening suspense on a consistent basis.<br />All of the above referenced themes are present in The Drowning Pool, which I think is MacDonald's best novel, though The Underground Man is right up there as well.<br />MacDonald's novels aren't just mind candy-reading him is a literary experience.  I believe that is why he was successful in a sort of restrained way.  Escapists will not get into these books-they are too cerebral.

Chief among these are the Bluebonnets, the Sate Flower of Texas.<br />The Legend of the Bluebonnet is the retelling of the old Indian legend of how this event came to occur.

MacDonald's Travis McGee series was one of the first truly successful \\"hard boiled detective\\" genre series to make it big at the mass market level of sales.  Written mostly in the 1960's and early 1970's the books could come across as somewhat dated time period pieces except that MacDonald was a suspense writer of the highest order whose gritty, hard edged characters come to life on the page just as readily today as they did back when written.<br />In point of fact, these really aren't \\"detective\\" books at all; they are generally better classified as suspense novels.  However, the formula utilized in the books, as well as the realistic, hard hitting writing style they displayed, set the stage for many a fictional detective series to follow.<br />McGee advertises himself as a \\"salvage\\" specialist.  He's more a high-end repo man.  If you've lost something of extraordinary value that you do not want the police involved in recovering, he'll do it for you-for 50% of the fair market value of the lost valuables.  Once he's made a big score he reverts to being a beach Bum in ft. Lauderdale Florida where he lives on the beach in a houseboat won in a card game.<br />The Travis McGee novels break down basically into two types of story either (A) a \\"recovery\\" tale and (B) a revenge tale.  The former is the far more common format.  <br />Pale Gray for Guilt is one of the latter.  Tush Bannon, one of Travis' old high school buddies, is killed by developers who want his land for a project, Travis swears revenge.  Along with his sidekick, Dr. Meyer, a nationally known economist and fellow beach bum, McGee sets in motion a complicated and dangerous scam to entrap and bankrupt the killers.<br />On the whole I like the recovery novels better than the revenge novels, but this is one of the better of the latter sort.  The plan is ingenious, the characters, as usual, well developed and the con victim so loathsome one is fully engaged in the effort to get the SOB.<br />This is probably not the best book to start out with McGee but, once hooked, this will make a very pleasant read.<br />A final note:  MavDonald wrote many novels other than the McGee series-however, all McGee novels have a color in the title.  If you're browsing for McGee, just select any novel with a color in the title, and there Travis will be.	2002-02-26

Max, empowered in this world as he never is in his own, becomes ruler in this world and \\"manages\\" the rumpus that characterizes it--why, he even has the power to deny the monsters their own suppers!<br />In the end, however, Max decides to return to his room--to discover that though gone, he was not forgotten.<br />This is a truly marvelous book.  It's fun to read aloud, allowing the reader to be as expressive and dramatic as he wishes.  The illustrations are delightful--colorful, action filled and, best of all, always a true complement to the story at all times.<br />One of the best children's books ever written.  May the Rumpus never end!	2002-02-26

A friend of mine who knows I am a big Tom Robbins fan asked me to appear before her Reading Group to discuss another Robbins novel and I was asked to describe Robbins body of work.  I said that Robbins collected works were sort of like a family of 12 where all the kids had one parent, say the mother,  in common but all of whom had different fathers, and all of whom were raised in different religions.  In a sense everybody's all together yet they are all over the place.<br />Robbins reminds me of Jonathan Lethem--a world-class author with a visionary imagination, a densely intellectual approach to writing, and a skewed worldview of epic proportions.  Still Life is in reality pretty much an \\"average\\" Robbins novel, but that is in fact sort of like saying that the Hope Diamond is your \\"average\\" 80-carat diamond.<br />What sets Still Life apart for me is that, though written many years ago, it's totally contemporary.  Ralph Nader is a major minor character--and what you see here about him is as relevant as it was when the book was written.  The Woodpecker is essentially a professional bomber--but is he merely a criminal (terrorist?)or an outlaw (freedom fighter?)?  There are Arabs as major characters--all in a state of internecine hostility.  And the symbolic hooey--and there's plenty of it here--is as New Age as New Age gets, even though it predates New Age by an eon.<br />I'd read the book years ago and recently reread it and found it as engaging, thought provoking and quirkily amusing as ever.  It's not many novels that can be a contemporary masterpiece of different decades.  So, though there are better Robbins books out there, I definitely think Still Life with Woodpecker is a \\"must read\\" even today.	2002-02-25

The Spenser series is one of my favorite detective fiction series, and this is my favorite Spenser novel.  You've got to love Spenser.  As hard boiled and cynical as he is, there's still the occasional glimpse into the regular guy  aspects of his persona.<br />Spenser travels to London to track down the killers of a rich Boston industrialist's family. They were killed in a terrorist bombing while vacationing in England.<br />In London, Spenser discovers that this is not exactly the group of amateurs he thought he was dealing with and summons Hawk for help. Spenser and Hawk track down and deal with the group in an odyssey that covers much of Europe and ends up in Montreal during the summer Olympics.  The guy's have discovered that the group they are dealing with is just a splinter organization of a much more serious group determined to disrupt the Olympics--and Spenser and Hawk are just as determined to stop them.<br />Full of energy, violence and the usual Spenser philosophizing, this is the most action packed and absorbing book in the Spenser series.	2002-02-18

A very unique reading experience.<br />Charlie, the protagonist in this novel, is a very intelligent, very naive high school freshman.  Intelligent and naïve is not a combination that matches a lot of high school cliques and Charlie is in fact severely limited in the popularity department-even thinking of himself as a `wallflower\\".<br />Charlie's story is told via a series of rather long letters to an unidentified friend-it's not clear if these are actually letters ever sent to anyone-that are open, honest, angst filled tales of what life in high school and home is like for Charlie.<br />This is a truly unique story told in a truly unique manner. Usually I loath the \\"letter\\" format of fiction, but in this case the letter format works-mainly because the letters essentially are chapter in fact.  Charlie comes through as a real person-the letters are the sort of philosophical rambling juxtaposed with mundane detail that so characterize teen thinking patterns.  Moreover, the story seems realistic-normal teen experiences with nothing overly dramatic or outlandish-till the very end, anyway.<br />A lot of people apparently don't like the twist at the end-I thought it fit in well.  It's clear almost from the onset something's up-Charlie is obviously trying to deal with something, it's just never clear what it is.  Finding out is a revelation that I think provides a quite fitting ending.<br />An exceptional effort-I'm really looking forward to more from Chbosky.	2002-02-14

Dick Francis is a formulaic writer, which is to say that one has a pretty good idea of the shape of the novel before one even cracks open the cover.  While this would be a death knell for longevity for many, it hasn't been for Francis.  This arises from the fact that his characters are so memorable and the milieu in which he casts his tales so rich and well defined that we totally forget that some of the plot mechanisms feel familiar.<br />Banker is a tale of a young British investment banker involved in a syndicate financing the stud career of a well know champion race horse.  After the deal is sealed there arises a problem--it appears the horse is genetically defective.  Our Banker suspects this is not entirely a natural phenomenon and starts investigating.  As always with Francis, this leads to intrigue, violence and murder.<br />Francis' ability to skillfully enter into a wide array of worlds in his novels is another strength--the world of investment banking is brought into sharp focus in a way that makes it interesting--not terminally boring, as one would imagine.<br />Banker is one of Francis' very best works--the characters are vivid and compelling, the mystery here is more refined than usual, the suspense builds very nicely.<br />If you haven't yet tried Francis, this would be a great book to start with.  It will set you on the path to a lot of great reading!	2002-02-14

The musings of the narrator are well formed and allow the reader move along at a brisk pace. It helps that Flaubert himself was a wacky and iconoclastic figure-one of those people we've all heard of but don't really know anything about unless you are some sort of 19th century French literature freak.<br />This was the first Barnes novel I read and it was so good I have been slowly working my way through his other books, which has proven to be an altogether delightful experience.  All of his novels are good-this one stands out from the pack.	2002-02-14

Wesley Lloyd Springer, Miss Julia's recently deceased husband, is the perfect caricature of the Baronic Southern Power Player.  Constantly reminding his wife of the importance of family, church and one's standing in the community as the pillars of a civilized society and her particular duties and responsibilities in those regards, he's out exercising his clout and power by intimidating everybody in town from his perch as owner of the local bank and carrying on illicit affairs.<br />Not long after Wesley Lloyd's death, the fruit of one such affair appears on Miss Julia's doorstep in the shape of a very small and scared little boy--Lloyds son--and this sets in motion a wild series of events that set the town--and Miss Julia's life-- on it's ear.<br />You'll love this book for it's genuine, authentic Southern voice and cadence. Some elements of the story are pretty far fetched, and the portrait of Miss Julia presents a tale of blissful ignorance that stretches credulity a bit too far (especially vis-à-vis her pastor) but those are minor quibbles.  The overall story line and reading experience are so delightful and the characters so engaging these minor flaws amount to little more than a bump in the road on an otherwise wonderful journey.	2002-02-13
US	53013845	R17ZDBCLZ4NXIE	0312863551	562507215	The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Heinlein is not your typical sci-fi writer.	Robert Heinlein is always hailed as one of the great sci-fi writers of all time, and I suppose that's true.  His novels do generally fall within the guidelines of what constitutes the sci-fi genre-i.e., books set in a space and time far removed into the future from present times.  And, clearly,  lot of his early work is truly sci-fi fare and little more.<br />However, what Heinlein is at heart is a social and political philosopher and commentator of the \\"homespun\\" variety with his politics being a weird blend of ultra serious patriotism mixed with a strong dose of libertarianism at times bordering on anarchism.  In a lot of ways Heionlein remids me of an old, rich oil man from Ft. Worth who used to use his radio ads as a sort of editorial platform.  One of his most often stated tenets is that the government should \\"deliver the mail, defend our shores and leave us the hell alone!\\".  Heinlein would have loved this guy.<br />This is not to say his views were simplistic, for the were not.  And Heinlein had a knack for developing interesting, complex stories around his world view including, among others, The Puppet Masters, Stranger in a Strange Land and the Moon is a Harsh Mistress.<br />The other thing that sets Heinlein apart from the sci-fi genre in general is his character development.  I know of no other author whose work consistently provides characters of the complexity, color and interest that are the norm in a Heinlein novel.<br />This book is a sort of American Revolution and Australian history lesson on the Moon in 2075 concept.  The Australian history component arises from the fact that the moon has been converted into a giant penal colony run by the powers that be on earth as a dumping ground for actual criminals as well as political dissidents.  The colony is run for profit for earth in a brutal and disinterested fashion by the Lunar Authority, a petty, disengaged bureaucracy.<br />A band of unlikely insurgents arises to ferment a revolution, a Jeffersonesqe professor of history, a Washintonesque man-of-all trades, a radical dissident-and an \\"aware\\" computer named Mike.<br />The story concerns the conduct and development of the revolution, with plenty of Heinleinesqe political commentary thrown in.  This commentary is never intrusive, however, as it is integrated into the story as the moral basis for the actions being undertaken.<br />In the end you have a complex and thoughtful novel of social alienation and revolution which involves characters of a sympathetic and charismatic nature.  It's hard enough to find all that in any sort of novel, much less sci-fi.<br />This is a book well worth reading.	2002-02-13

Eddie Coffin is a second rate professor of philosophy with many troubles--the bottle, authority, remembering his name, and so on.  Immersed in a mini sexual scandal, he flees to France, joins fortunes with another interesting social outcast, and begins a life of crime.<br />Essentially a commentary on social disaffection and anomie, Fischer cleverly shrouds his consideration of general social ills in a skewed, aberrant, yet extremely entertaining veil of philosophical didactics between the partners in crime.<br />The key here is character development as the plot, such as it is, remains minimal throughout the novel.  The characters are fully capable of carrying the day, however.<br />All in all a very good, if somewhat lightweight (for Fischer, anyway), effort.	2002-02-13

As Sabine and Parsifal's family try to understand the dynamics of Parsifal's lives with the other party, one can almost see the way to healing and redemption for at least some of those involved.<br />A book of unusual, complex characters in non conventional settings, the strength of this book is how it demonstrates that, no matter how different and non-conformist we may be on the surface, we are nevertheless very remarkably the same in what we want and what we fear.<br />A lovely and oddly inspiring story.	2002-02-12

However. Some of her assumptions about her new daughter prove to be in error and she finds she has a greater task than she bargained for on her hands.<br />What I most like about The Bean Tress is the sense of connection you have with the characters and their no nonsense approach to life.  These are people on the edge of society trying to work within the rules doing the best they can with what they have without regret, remorse or any sense of victimization<br />This is a novel of love and friendship, abandonment and belonging and the discovery of surprising spiritual resources arising from apparently empty spaces, The Bean Trees is one of the best books I have ever read.	2002-02-12

Auster has a way with a certain type of character-one who is both on the fringe of  both society and sanity both.  They are not often very likeable or sympathetic characters, but they always are engrossing characters.  <br />Jim Nash's veneer of sanity breaks when an unexpected windfall from the father he hates kicks out what little emotional support kept him on the straight and narrow and converts him into a wandering, nomadic drifter with his own transportation.  In the midst of his journeys he meets Jack Pozzi, also a wanderer-sans transportation.  Pozzi suckers Nash into an questionable gambling adventure that backfires, leaving them with a debt that leaves then essentially in a state of indentured servitude.  The bulk of the story centers on how they cope with that condition.<br />The fundamentals of the story, as is so often the case with Auster, are , on reflection, faintly ridiculous.  However, it is mood, character and fate that concern Auster, and his-and our-immersion into those topics render the absurdities of the actual story irrelevant.<br />I've read several Auster books and can't really say I've like any of them particularly, but they do fascinate me.  I keep going back for more.  The bottom line is what Auster does is ask questions about life and fate-in such a way that you are forced to think about them in your own terms. Auster does not supply answers-heck, not one of his books I've read can really be said to have an ending or resolution of any meaningful sort-but the way the questions are posed will haunt you-and keep you coming back for more.	2002-02-11

For recreation and diversion from the oppressions and petty discipline of Catholic School, Francis Dole and his fellow alter boys have created Sodom vs. Gomorrah '74--a very explicit series of comic books featuring the priests and nuns of Sacred Heart engaging in extreme violation of the 7th Commandment.  Unfortunately, a copy falls into the hands of Father Kavanagh.<br />The scheme they devise to extricate themselves from this mess is as creative as it is tragic.<br />The book eloquently conveys the nature-and frustrations-of parochial school life in a more intolerant and authoritarian church environment than usually exists in such institutions today (chiefly, I suspect, because of the dearth of priests and nuns available to staff the places) for folks like me who endured the experience.  It will also remind you of some of the characters of that time and the misadventures they got into.<br />Some aspects of the story are a bit out there, but this isn't really an issue while you are reading the book.

One of the most bizarre, creative books I've read in a long time.  This is basically a 1940's variety hard-boiled PI mystery set in a distant, science fiction future, Orwellianesque Oakland.<br />In the future, both animals and infants routinely speak and behave like adults thanks to \\"evolution therapy\\".  Conrad Metcalf is a jaded private investigator whose latest case pits him against both the police and local gangsters when his most recent client, a wealthy urologist, is found murdered.  After the prime suspect, already condemned and scheduled for long term hibernation for another cime, convinces Metcalf he's not his man, the case gives Conrad's gumshoe instincts a workout.  He's led down a meandering trail upon which he meets the victim's widow and an evolved baby who may--or may not--be hers, and discovers a sinister blueprint for a backroom barracks designed to house other evolved babies for nefarious purposes.  <br />This novel is a sparking pastiche of Chandleresque detective fiction, Orwellian political fiction, and Gibsonian science fiction displaced to an almost comical yet chilling postmodern landscape.  Amid its smartly delivered first-person narration and crackling dialog, even a tough-talking kangaroo hit-man that intermittently tangles with Metcalf seems plausible.<br />Truly fascinating!	2002-02-11

Life Studies from the Dismal Trade is the subtitle of Thomas Lynch's extraordinary collection of essays.  It says far more about the substance of this book than the title itself.<br />Lynch is the sole funeral director in Milford, Michigan. As such, as he states in his opening, he \\"buries a couple of hundred of his towns people\\".  It is not, an occasional aside notwithstanding, the technical aspects of his job that lynch focuses on here, however.  As the subtitle suggests, it is the living that concern Mr. Lynch, and, in fact, as an undertaker, it is the living, not the dead, he truly serves.  For, as he is wont to point out, the dead don't care.<br />The living, on the other hand, care a great deal.  Especially in cases of tragic, unforeseen death.  The young murder victim's family, the suicide's family, and so on.<br />Mr. Lynch is a published poet.  So his essays are not the dry stuff of technical journals, but rater elegant, philosophical expositions on the nature of death, the nature of survival, and the nature of his profession.<br />One would think that this would be a rather depressing read but, in fact, it is anything but.<br />I have recommended the book to many friends-boomers like myself with aging parents.  Reading this book helped me to deal more effectively with my own parent's deaths. It helps one put some perspective on the rituals that we observe attendant to death.  That it manages to inform and entertain as well is a remarkable achievement.	2002-02-07

Given thatr Katrinka is mostly a frustrated wirter and lover both, the exploits are somewhat chaotic, obsessive and disjointed--but that's where the fun comes in. <br />Over and above an adept hand at romantic comedy, Medwed has a nifty ability to cleverly encapsulate and parody the aloofness, snobbery and liberal goings and general absurdities attendant to life in and around Harvard, a skill which also adds to the fun of the book.<br />This is a debut novel and some of the expected flaws attendant to such an effort are present--the books a tad disjointed, a few of the characters are mere characatures--but overall it's a fun book &amp; a pleasant read.  It's plane or beach fare-not too demanding and mostly rewarding.	2002-02-06

Positing the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting, the book explores the power that art can exert upon us to the point of obsession.<br />The book is essentially 8 different yet interrelated short stories about the circumstances of the historical owners of the painting in question,  the Girl in Hyacinth Blue.  The transition between stories is accomplished through a series of interlocutory vignettes concerning the circumstances of Vermeer's life and the actual creation of the painting. Although I actually like Vermeer's work, I knew next to nothing about his personal life and found these passages quite interesting.<br />On the whole I found the stories quite compelling as well, though there were a few that would have benefited from a bit more development and a more thorough presentation.<br />However, on the whole I found the book quite riveting and entertaining.  In the end I was left wishing the painting did in fact exist-even without knowing what it actually looked like--the cover illustration aside-I felt a bit obsessed with it myself.  That Vreeland could evoke such a feeling says a lot about the quality of her book.	2002-02-06

Rather, most of his work evolved out of what he described as \\"thought experiments\\" wherein he posed questions and considered-and rejected-possible solutions in his head.  To the extent his theories have been \\"scientifically\\" verified, it has been through  the lab work of others who sought to prove or disprove his theories.<br />Lightman has taken the \\"thought experiment\\" concept and converted it into this work, transforming the waking \\"experiments\\" into sleep time \\"dreams\\" that, through a series of short vignettes, illustrate both the process and the substance of Einstien's theories and work processes.<br />To the scientifically sophisticated-especially about physics-- this book will probably come across as simplistic and a bit of a bore.  Everyone else, that being, I suspect, 99.995% of the potential audience for the work, should find it both fascinating and somewhat educational.<br />Be aware, however, this book is about Einstein's ideas-not about the man himself.  If what you are looking for is insight into Albert the man, look elsewhere.  If you have a mild interest in trying to understand what the heck the man was talking about, this is the book for you.	2002-02-06

There are two kinds of &quot;best selling&quot; author. <br />The first type skillfully produces high level pabulum meant to numb the mind and induce a pleasant state of catatonic cognitive suspension in the reader (which explains the scourge of Danville Steel).<br />The other kind has the ability to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, to make us see things we've never seen, to contemplate the meaning of life, and so on. Each generation produces one or two of the second type. Tom Robbins is one of these.<br />All of Robbins novels have graced the bet seller list for quite a length of time, which speaks to their universal appeal.  Most of his major works, Another Roadside Attraction, Even Cowgirls get the Blues, Still Life with Woodpecker, Skinny Legs and All, and Jitterbug Perfume have attained the status of \\"cult classic\\" as well-each with its own unique audience.  I know of no other author that this can be said of.<br />Which makes Robbins a one-of-a-kind type of author as well.<br />In my opinion, Jitterbug Perfume is Robbins masterpiece.  A novel of epic proportions, a story of great breadth, and amazing, extraordinary, eternally memorable characters, Jitterbug Perfume took my breath away.<br />This is the seminal work of a unique, Monstrous talent.  <br />Treat yourself to the best.  Read this book.	2002-02-06

Colors of the Mountain is the story of Da Chen's coming of age in post revolutionary, rural China.  The son of a family of &quot;landlords&quot;, a despised class in China at this time, the book is semi autobiographical and is an inspirational tale of prevailing against long odds. It is also a wonderful window into life in rural China--the nature of the countryside, the characters all small towns seem to produce in doves all over the planet, the struggles that everyone must endure off in the &quot;boonies&quot;. (One suspects that these elements of the story probably aren't far from what life is currently, China being the place it is.)<br />On the whole I found the narrative to be compelling, the characters memorable and the story quite well structured.  If there is a major flaw in the novel it's that the language is sometimes repetitive and awkward--one can intuit that English is obviously not Mr. Chen's native tongue.  On the whole, however, this flaw in the end just adds to the charm and mood of the tale far more than it detracts from it.<br />I bought 5 or 6 copies of this to give out as Christmas gifts this past December and everyone who I gave it to has enjoyed it.  You will too.	2002-02-06

Sebastien Japrisot is a world class author and this is his best work to date.  <br />Part mystery, part historical fiction, part war novel, part romance, A Very Long Engagement follows the exploits of one Mathilde Donnay as she tries to establish just what really happened to her fiancé on the front lines during a battle at Picardy in WW1. <br />Mathilde is one of the truly unique protagonists to appear in many a year.  Her determination and unyielding spirit are quite inspiring.<br />This is a book that speaks to many things-honor, devotion, love, the chaos and cruelties  of war, friendship, the triumph of the individual.  It's the sort of novel that warms your soul while concomitantly breaking your heart.  In the end, it stands as a remarkable spiritual work that will stay with you forever.<br />Everyone should read this book.	2002-02-05

Essentially what it seems she's tried to do here is &quot;novelize&quot;  a series of short story ideas, totally without success.  Janowitz specializes in off the wall characters, but there is a fine line between off the wall and simply bizarre, and Janowitz crosses it with a vengeance here.<BR> <BR>And it's not just the characters, but the situations as well.  There's a long aside about dealing with a severed head that's pointless, ridiculous and adds not a whit to the story.<br />It's unfortunate--the basic concept of finding a wayward child in trouble, running off to save the boy, then coming back as a man (this was a very mannish woman to begin with) might have had some interesting possibilities for humor and social insight.  But the situation is so buried in detritus and the set of characters so contrived neither insight--nor much humor-emerges.<br />Ms. Janowitz would be well served by steering a bit more toward the mainstream and worrying a bit more about developing a story rather than a reputation.	2002-02-05

I really do like Jeanette Winterson and have read several of her novels, all of which have been very good.  Books like Sexing the Cherry, Oranges are not the Only Fruit, Passion and Gut Symmetries were well written, insightful, truly unique and well constructed  stories told in a bold, clear & decisive voice.<br />This book, however. is an unfortunate mess.  I hate giving authors I truly like such a lousy rating, but in this case it's unavoidable. <br />One of the blurbs on the book cover speaks to a \\"writer writing about something terribly important\\", which may in fact be the case, if only one could figure out just what it is.  It's really a shame as the concept is intriguing-the execution is the problem.<br />Winterson is a master of the use of language, usually leaving the reader painting vivid-though often very unsettling-mental pictures to accompany the text.  Here however the text is so dense, the characterizations so obscure, the thought process so complex that one can-and often does-- read and reread a passage several time, still emerging with no real idea what is going on.<br />Everyone has a bad day now and then-and with this effort, Winterson has definitely had hers.  This is truly an author worth reading but this effort should be skipped.	2002-02-05

I've read all of Murakami's works available in English and this his best work ever--which is saying something as he is a truly gifted writer who possesses a vivid imagination, a unique, compelling writing style who delivers consistently first rate fiction on a regular basis.<br />At heart this is a book about the societal schizophrenia that characterizes modern day Japan-a country that revels in it's ancient history and heritage but cannot admit or cope with it's 20th century history and shame, that basks in economic success and power while enduring political decay and corruption, that is obsessed with its racial homogeneity while steadfastly denying the attendant alienation and anomie that is engendered by the forces of conformity and sublimation of personality the obsession creates.<br />Murakami's genius is his ability to express and convey this reality through, on the one hand, the most ordinary and mundane protagonists imaginable and allegorical illusions derived from the most mundane of surroundings.  In this case the former is Toru Okada, the sort of fellow who perpetually seems to be involved in the contemplation of his existence while, say, cooking spaghetti.  <br />Toru doesn't get around much even though he's trying to find his lost wife, his lost cat-basically, his lost life.  He nevertheless does get around enough to meet an unusual cast of characters, each of whom represents an aspect of Japanese society-whether it be disaffect war veterans, alienated teenagers or powerful-and powerfully corrupt-politicians.  In fact most of Toru's travels are to and through so-called alley, blocked at both ends, That serves as a microcosm of Japan itself and is littered with other ordinary allegorical detritus--the statue of a bird looking sadly unable to fly, and the unidentified wind-up bird that creaks invisibly in a nearby tree, the a dry well Toru spends so much time meditating in, a house abandoned because of a series of tragedies and so on.<br />This may not sound like it adds up to much of a story, but, in fact, it's a cauldron of stories-a mystery, a surrealistic fable, a deadpan comedy, a military history,  and a love story-all of which work on their own and all of which blend into the whole.<br />This is not an easy book to read-yet it's impossible to put down.  What more can you ask of a novel but thoughtful literary entrapment?  You get it here in droves.	2002-02-05

Ernesto Quinonez's first novel, Bodega Dreams, is a modern update on the Great Gatsby formula, set in Spanish Harlem.  Quinonez has an original and authentic writing voice-particularly when it comes to establishing setting, character and mood- but the dialog is often a step behind-a few too many clichs, language a little to refined for a ghetto setting.

Body and Soul tracks the development of a young fellow named Claude Rawlings from the first intimations that this child has a unique musical talent through his childhood and young adulthood as he hones and develops that talent, finally to emerge as a full blown classical piano star.<br />It's an interesting twist on the conventional coming of age story.  Many cite this as the classic \\"rags-to-riches\\" tale but, in truth, there is very little of either rags or riches involved.  it's mostly about the sort of commitment and dedication--and the lucky breaks- on has to engage in to be a success of this type on this order.<br />I'm not sufficiently qualified to judge whether the actual \\"apprenticeship\\" aspects of the book are realistic--it's been criticized by some on that score--but it all seemed reasonable to me.  If it's not truly realistic it's not ridiculously unrealistic either--and no basis for not enjoying the book on it's other merits.<br />Conroy has a clear, concise and engaging writing style and has the ability to effectively convey mood within the story.  The result is a inspiring and entertaining tale that will, for many, open a window onto a world most of us don't know much about.<br />This is well worth a read.	2002-02-05

I really like Ms. Jnowitz's work, which is something since I usually find most-if not all-of her characters pretty loathsome.  It's a rare talent who can write a book on subject matter that one finds mildly repulsive--yet leaves you looking for more of her work to read.<br />Slaves of New York is a series of vignettes concerning life in Manhattan amongst a loose array of artists, some of whom are continuing characters throughout the novel and some of whom are strictly bit players.  I put artists in quotes as there is nothing descriptive of any of these people work that amounts to more than self indulgent trash--several times throughout the book I was reminded of that old saw that lousy artists always admire each others workbut it is character that is center stage here, and a wilder assortments of characters it is.  A somewhat skewed assortment to be certainis... depravity an a priori requirement for being an artist in New York City???but entertaining nonetheless.<br />This is not a novel for those who are predisposed to think that banning questionable books from high school libraries is a good idea as there are some decidedly hard core moments in the book.  If that sort of thing doesnt put you off, then this is, somehow, a remarkably engaging and entertaining novel.	2002-02-05

I was very disappointed as the premise held such promise. But the book is overly repetitive (how many times do you have to say Click Clack Moo before it dtrarts to grate?  Ferwe than are required by the text, that's for sure), the drawings are not very impressive (too many are too dark and amorphous) and the story, such as it is, doesn't amount to much.<br />I think most kid's at the lower end of the target age range will like it OK, but for the life of me I can't imagine how anyone familiar with any of the classics of literature aimed at this age group could ever regard this as that sort of effort. It's mediocre at best.<br />If you want a great book for this target age get Courduroy, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, Gregory the Terrible Eater or Bailer Goes Camping--all much better stories that are far less expensive than this book.	2002-02-04

Kitchen is actually a book containing two separate novellas with similar themes-loss and loneliness.  <br />Although not the most upbeat of themes, Yoshimoto deals with this subject matter with warmth, sensitivity and compassion.   <br />Like most Japanese writing there's a heavy emphasis on symbolism and allegory, but unlike most Japanese writing the vehicles chosen are familiar to, and cherished by, the mainstream American reading public.  What emerges is a work remarkable for it's accessibility and ability to impact the reader. <br />Yoshimoto was wise to adopt the novella format-it allows for the flexibility to examine he subjects fully from distinctly different points of view, allowing for a more in depth and thoughtful exploration of her themes, while allowing ample opportunity to flesh out and animate her characters.<br />It's not often one finds a book that can achieve a high order of heartwarming sensitivity without indulging in overbearing sentimentality and/or sappiness.  That Yoshimoto has managed to do so is a tribute to her skill and discipline as a writer.<br />I've given this book to several friends and family members as a gift-a very wide range of folks with highly variable tastes-and everyone has expressed deep appreciation for this gift.<br />Do yourself a favor-don't wait for someone to happen to give you this book-get it and read it on your own.

Sebastien Japrisot is a world class writer who remains surprisingly unknown in the U.S.  His works are usually-I think quite inappropriately-assigned to the Suspense genre. To say Japrisot is a suspense writer is akin to describing an aircraft carrier as a boat-it's technically correct but doesn't begin to fully communicate the reality of the situation.<br />Women in evidence is a case in point.  This is a novel of enormous complexity.  At heart it is about loves as obsession-irrational, lustful, confining, explosive obsession.  All of these facets of love as obsession are explored through a series of vignettes concerning-presumably, though one is never really certain-one man's relationships with a series of women as related by the women. <br />We know that what is about to transpire will be highly charged and volatile as we met this fellow at to opening of the novel.  He is running along a beach, bleeding profusely from a gun shot wound.  Fallen on the beach, he reflects on his situation and how he got there-leading us into the stories that follow.<br />Although all relatively short, the stories themselves are highly charged, compelling, consuming and sufficiently detailed and well constructed as to seems to be stand alone tales unrelated to one another-yet, there runs throughout the series tantalizing tidbits that seem to tie them all together as fragments of the same man's history.  But are they?  And if so, which one explains his extreme situation on the beach?<br />This is one of the most original and complex novels I've ever read.  I was completely absorbed and beguiled by it from cover to cover.  Like Japrisot's other best works, reading Women in Evidence is physically and intellectually demanding experience, well worth the time and effort for those willing to take the plunge.<br />Dive in and revel in the mystery.<br />(In the interests of full disclosure, for those who think the title of this review seems familiar, it is a quote by Churchill.  Once, when asked to explain Russia, he replied \\"One cannot.  Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma\\".)	2002-02-04

Melita Azzard is a forthright Maltese girl who delivers and services jukeboxes. Her resourceful cousin Zammit collects the makings of these jukeboxes from the rubble of bombed out buildings in 1942 Mslta and transforms them into objects of beauty and artistry.  <br />That is what Nicholas Rinaldi has done with this novel.  It is a beautiful tapestry constructed from the fragments and debris left over by engagements of war and love.<br />Rocco Raven, a young, impressionable Brooklynite inserted into the chaos of Malta during an air raid in 1942 feels as if he has fallen through the looking glass instead.  He cannot find his superior officer, instead falling under the influence of a very shady captain in the American Army intelligence corps.  They, along with one other intelligence officer, constitute the total American presence on Malta. The other main military presence is that of a contingent of British pilots trapped in a very Catch 22-esque sort of duty&#8212;each time one of them gets shot down and survives-he gets promoted.  Rocco sees-and falls for&#8212;Melita, and is swept into the chaos of life on Malta during the war helping out with the jukebox business when not trying to do his intelligence work and/or trying not to get sucked into the various shady deals his superior officer is embroiled in.<br />Rinaldi does a masterful job of truly developing the characters, the scene, the sense of unreality that was wartime Malta.  The love story is genuine and moving.  The wartime shenanigans of Rocco&#8217;s superior are just zany and dangerous enough to capture our imaginations.  And the chaos, tragedy and farce that is modern warfare is in full evidence throughout the novel.<br />This is a truly great book.  Read it.	2002-02-03

Dick Francis has earned a well deserved reputation as one of the best suspense writers around--based more on his writing skills and character development that any real talent for suspense.  This is because virtually all his books, regardless of character and milieu, follow a well developed formula.  By the third or forth Francis book one has a pretty good feel for how things will proceed. His average books are well enough crafted to keep your attention, his better books--such as Banker, Reflex and Proof--grab you by the throat and won't let go till you are done.<br />Blood Sport is a significant departure for Francis.  The formula is gone, the action aspects of his work take back seat to a much more cerebral style and the main character is far from the iconoclastic, self reliant individualist we normally expect from Francis.<br />Gene Hawkins is a \\"screener\\" for the British Government-essentially a \\"mole\\" hunter.  He is also suicidal-his previous relationship has shattered and left the man a psychological mess.  He has sublimated his troubles into his work-until now.  Faced with a mandatory three week leave his boss, fearful for his employee's life-sets him onto the trail of the thieves of one of his pals thoroughbred race horses in America.<br />What follows is one of the more bizarre, compelling chase stories I have ever read.  It is also the most unusual novel Francis has written to date.<br />Not all Francis fans will like this book-as the previous reviews will attest.  However, I found the story very compelling and felt more of a real connection to the characters than is the norm with a Francis novel.  I also found it to be more of a true suspense novel than is usually the case with Francis.<br />I urge Francis fans to give it a try.	2002-02-03

The Buddha of Suburbia is set in London in the 1970's during the peak of the Punk Revolution.  It is a time where the psychological impact of the reality of the loss of Empire is at it's zenith and the explosion in the &quot;ethnic&quot; components of London's population is underway. Society is in a cultural and social upheaval and the world of Karim Amir as presented by Hanif Kureishi serves as an eloquent microcosm of that upheaval.<br />Karims rather staid middle class London suburban existence is coming apart as the novel opens.  His English mother and Indian father's marriage is quickly disintegrating.  His father's escape from this disaster is to become the \\"Buddha of Suburbia\\", mouthing trite Indian spiritual sayings for desperate middle aged suburban housewives and so forth.  When is dad and one of his \\"disciples\\" become romantically involved, Karim is introduced into the whirlwind of London punk social life and then thoroughly swept up in the tide, ultimately achieving a measure of true personal success as all around him flounder in overindulgent self-indulgence.<br />Kureishi does a remarkable job of painting a detailed and well textured portrait of a society in flux during times of economic, artistic and racial turmoil through a cast of characters that adroitly symbolize the various factions of the disintegrating society while maintaining their integrity as fully formed and sympathetic (for the most part anyway) individuals.<br />I quite liked the book but I feel one should be forewarned that this book does have some rather unsavory, hardcore elements and situations in it that will not be everyone's cup of tea.  If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, dive right in and enjoy the show.	2002-02-03

Ruth Ozeki' has a political point to make about American society and, in the best tradition of all social evangelists, she makes it with a sledge hammer.  There is room for legitimate debate about how food in general, and meat in particular, is grown and harvested in America, but you will get only one side of that debate here.  Subtlety does not make an appearance on this score.  And, if that were all there was to this book, I would give it zero stars and move on. <br />However, the \\"meats\\" aspect is just the tip of the iceberg here and to focus ion it is to miss the beauty of this novel.  <br />Jane Takagi-Little, the protagonist, is a Japanese-American starving-artist documentary filmmaker who's circumstances force her to accept a commission from a Japanese beef trade group to produce a TV series for Japanese TV.  The purpose of the program is to stimulate beef consumption in Japan via scenes from idealized American rural life of hearty plains folks growing happy and strong on beef (recipies to be included).  The big boys want nice, slim, Anglo types with nary a scintilla of evidence of coronary disease.<br />What the producers fail to see is that what a person is often is more than what they appear to be.  Chosen in large part for her Japanese-ness, Jane is in actuality a fully assimilated American culturally<br />Placed under the guidance of a sycophantic local producer, a zany production crew, and armed with an inherent rebellious disposition, Jane sets about finding all sorts of rotund, ethnic families to highlight in the show.<br />The book is as much about being at the vortex of multiculturalism as it is about the beef industry.  Jane's need to try to provide some actual educational content within the show about the realities of life in America as opposed to the \\"idealized\\" view of her employers, her growing disgust of the practices of the American beef industry, her search for love, her struggles to mesh with her production crew, her desire to tweak the providers of her desperately needed income, all combine to weave a tale of frustration and longing that is as delightful as it is unique.<br />I've read a lot of the reviews and you'd think this was simply a manifesto about the dangers of meat.  It's way more than that and, if you can adopt an apolitical attitude and jump in and enjoy the story as opposed to worrying about the propaganda, you are in for a real treat.	2002-02-03
US	53013845	RWGBZTI0X7WF3	0679753834	420678567	The Risk Pool	Books	5	4	5	N	N	It doesn't get any better than this.	The Risk Pool is brilliant.  <br />This is the story of the relationship between a wayward father and his only son told over a 30-year span. Sam Hall is the &quot;black sheep&quot; of a small, upper New York State town that's hit the end of the line economically.  Sam lives on the wrong side of the tracks in a place where there's hardly a right side of the tracks.   The town, like many of it's ilk, is inhabited by a set of characters who are down, &amp; mostly out, but nevertheless hanging in there somehow.  Sam, estranged from his wife, and in and out of town between his tussles with local authority, nevertheless manages to keep up a sort of on-again-off-again relationship with his son, Ned, of sufficient strength that Sam dominates Ned's existence even through his many absences.<br />Russo's genius is his ability to truly capture the feel for the bypassed urban landscape and the people who inhabit such places.  His characters are so vividly drawn that one finds oneself sympathetic even to those we loath to a large degree.  This is an aspect that appears in all Russo's novels to date.  In the Risk pool, however, Russo also deftly renders the dynamics of the father-son relationship with it's equal mix of attraction and repulsion. An equally deft exploration of the dynamics of male friendship/bonding in general is also rendered.<br />I particularly appreciated the ending--not usually the strong point of a Russo novel--with it's imagery of having both come full circle--this is a story that ends where it begins, as does all son-father sagas, both fictional and real.<br />Russo's writing style is elaborate and dense, and can be slow moving, though not in any sort of negative sense--this is one of those books you hate to put down--but rather from being rich in texture; as rich in texture as the life we'd like to live.<br />The Risk Pool stands, in the end, as the epitome of the prototypical small town America coming-of-age story.E veryone should read this book.	2002-02-01
US	53013845	R9NW61FTPHDYH	067973709X	513448067	Mating: A Novel	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Deep & complex novel of near monumental scope & breadth.	Reduced to it's core, Mating is a novel of intellectual disillusionment and cynicism on a grand scale as exemplified by the unnamed 30ish female protagonist who loves the idea of the scholarly life but is too selfish, self indulgent, and indolent to actually live such a life-as the story starts she's more or less abandoned the research and writing of her dissertation, mostly out of indifference and boredom.  Rush perfectly captures the wildly idiosyncratic nature of the disaffected intellectual--the elevated vocabulary and wacky non sequiturs, elevated thinking ruthlessly aimed at trivial matters, the seduction of \\"big ideas\\" and the aversion to physical labor, the elevation of cognition as the only worthy aspect of character, the breadth of arenas in which one considers oneself to be \\"qualified\\" to judge in detail, and so on.  And the major underlying themes of the novel-- feminism, socialism, political corruption, foreign-sponsored rural development projects, and, yes, male-female relations-are competently captured by Rush in his dense and prolific prose.  Anyone who has spent any significant length of time with graduate students will instantly recognize both the narrator and Noonan as they read this novel.<br />Mating is a fiercely intelligent and hugely ambitious.  It covers a tremendous amount of ground.  It would be well worth reading if that were the only benefits that would accrue to the effort.  The real genius of the novel, however, is in the construction and development of the narrator's character.  Based on my experience, Rush has perfectly captured the essence of the dilatory liberated female intellectual mind's world view of knowledge, life and love/sex.  This is no small accomplishment. It is only truly achievable on the scale in which Rush works-it is the very breadth, density and complexity of the work that allows for the in-depth development and expression of the totality of the narrator's character.<br />On top of all that the book paints a uniquely rich picture of the dynamics of rural life on the African plains within a more-or less genuinely valid scientific context.<br />This is not easy reading.  However, for those willing to work a bit, reread a bit, and savor the intricacies of the work, this is a truly rewarding novel.	2002-02-01

Frances Shore is a young English bride joining her prototypical bland English engineer husband as expats living in Saudi Arabia.  She's been fully warned that life for w woman in Saudi Arabia is \\"unpleasant\\", but she quickly learns that \\"unpleasant\\" is truly an understatement.  The repressive and authoritarian aspects of fundamentalist Muslim society, and the cynicism it breeds among the educated middle classes within it, are on full display here.<br />Moreover, though the day-to-day grind of Saudi life is stressful enough, Frances begins to suspect that something truly ugly is occurring in their apartment building.  She is alone in her concern about this though--her husband is a fairly crass and indifferent sort can't be bothered and, as a woman, she has no standing whatsoever to engage anyone else into looking into things.<br />This book has been much criticized as \\"negative\\" and \\"exaggerated\\" but as recent events illuminate the realities of life for women in the Muslim world in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, one has the sense that the book renders a much more realistic picture than many would like to believe.<br />This is a low key suspense novel.  There are no \\"grand\\" moments and it does not build to any sort of crescendo. The ending is open and quite ambiguous.  However, I see this not as the flaw many proclaim it to be but as a part of the whole.  When I finished the book I felt weighted down and oppressed--yet disappointed the story was over.  I realized that the books real accomplishment was to render for me in as much a physical as an intellectual way the weight and anxiety that simple day to day life imposes on women in the Muslim world.  <br />And that is no small accomplishment.	2002-02-01

No one can fault his ambitious and aggressive imagination and creativity.  He possesses a truly unique worldview and writing style.  He has written some truly wonderful novels--most notably Gun, with Occasional Music and Motherless Brooklyn.  <br />However, all of that notwithstanding, he is also a very frustrating writer in that his body of work is very uneven.  There are ideas that no doubt looked quite tempting in the conceptual stage that should have been dumped in the writing phase as it should have been clear it wasn't going to work as a novel.  Girl in Landscape is a case in point.<br />The book is essentially an experiment in a change of context--in this case, a classic &quot;western&quot; set in a sci-fi context;  instead of the classic American Western we have the classic Alpha Centuri (or whatever) western.  This is not a new conceptual vehicle for Lethem; Gun with Occasional Music also followed this model.  However Gun was a focused novel--a detective story first and foremost.  Girl, on the other hand, is an unfocused mess.  Is it a &quot;coming of age&quot; story or a &quot;displaced&quot; western?  Unfortunately, it tries to be both and succeeds in being neither.<br />Whereas in other Lethem novels the weird tableau of scene and character support and enhance the story, here they seem to take it over.  In the end, the scenery is more compelling than the character and story.<br />I suppose it's a small price to pay--a few unmemorable and disappointing novels one must endure to experience the true joy of Lethem's extraordinary, first rate novels, but I think both reader and author would be better served by a more disciplined approach that sidelined marginal efforts such as this one.	2002-01-31

This book should come with a warning label:  Read this book alone! Constant chuckling and laughing out loud in public will lead people to think you are crazy!<br />Ostensibly, this is a spoof of a &quot;vampire&quot; tale.  That's like saying Gone with the Wind was about farm life in the south. It utterly fails to convey the substance of the novel.<br />That substance is derived from the characters--the usual well defined and full blown whackos that inhabit all of Moore's novels.  As with all of Moore's novels the locale is a major character as well, and while most of his work is set in small, quirky towns, this one is set in San Francisco, lending an additional element of urban wackiness to the whole thing.<br />The thing with Moore that most astounds is his characters are cartoons in many ways-but have no cartoonish sense about them.  Instead, they remind you of all your best friends, and, like your best friends, you care about these people.  That makes the story compelling and, interestingly, the humor more intense.<br />Make no mistake--this is light, recreational reading.  But is it light, recreational reading of the highest order.<br />I have read all of Moore's books (save the one just issued) and while all are humorous and enjoyable, this one is his best by far.	2002-01-31

The characters are vivid, the humor wicked and the pace of the book is frenetic.

Both are exceedingly funny and can be read by &quot;the other side&quot; and still be apprciated and enjoyed immensely.<br />A fast, easy enjoyable read.  Take it with you on a plane trip--this book will relieve the unending tedium that travel now entails. Or better yet--give it to your significant other as a gift at Valentine's Day or a birthday.

I've read all of Lesley's books and can recommend them all.  His real talent centers on an acute ability to elegantly and truthfully convey the dynamics of the son-father relationship in all it's manifestations (it's nephew-uncle in the case of The Sky Fisherman, but that's not really important), the intricacies of small town life and the tensions between Native American culture and greater American society.<br />These are &quot;guy&quot; books. The few women who inhabit the pages are little more than caricature--the action is the interactions between men, between men and boys and between men, boys and nature.<br />The real pleasure in Lesley's books is that while the story has nothing to do with how you related to your father in terms of the nature of the story, place and/or characters, by the end of the story you realize it has everything to do with you and your father.  Lesley has captured the essence of the relationship--that's the substance.  The rest is just well written window dressing, but very engaging and engrossing window dressing.<br />I'd suggest any woman beating her head against the wall trying to find a great gift for a father or husband give one of Lesley's books.  You can't go wrong whichever one you choose.	2002-01-23

The book reminds me of a well done Robert Altman film.  The story is background to the development of character in an ensemble environment.  In the end, the sum is greater than the pieces.<br />Essentially this is a series of intertwined short stories concerning the intersection of  lives and love in a smallish town, the sort of place where even after on has loved and lost the former love is still part of the scene and a major intersect point in the carrying on of life.  There are no &quot;deep revelations&quot; and the book never orients itself to judge the nature of love--seemingly a major failing if you read previous reviews.  (I find it hard to condemn an effort for not accomplishing something it never set out to do, but whatever.) This is a deft and engaging effort that I think most folks-if they will only accept it for what it is and portends to be--highly engaging beach fare--will like enormously, as I did.	2002-01-22

Actually, I liked the book but found it incredibly disappointing. The problem is this isn't a novel-it's three novels tied together by too tenuous a thread crammed into much too confined a space.<br />There is the story of Eliza, tabbed as \\"slow\\" by the school system, who one day achieves well beyond expectations and sets in motion a wholesale recalculation of who she is and what she's capable of on everyone's part. This is the first story line, the one Goldberg tries unsuccessfully to use as the glue to hold the entire novel together. This concept has brilliant possibilities but gets too bogged down in major doses of Jewish mysticism along the way that detract mightily from the core idea.<br />The second story line surrounds Eliza's brother's descent into Krishna. Again, there are strong moments here as well but the story line is too fragmented and overwhelmed by other detail to hold together convincingly. Then there is Eliza's mother's descent into psychosis through kleptomania, again, an interesting story that never really gets told though there are snippets that illustrate what the possibilities were.<br />In the end one can't help but feel somewhat attached to Eliza in a sort of amorphous way. One is left to wonder just how terrific this story could have been if Goldberg had concentrated enough on her story to have revealed her as a fully developed character.	2002-01-22

His novels seem to be either brilliant (Motherless Brooklyn, Gun with Occasional Music) or truly awful (Girl in Landscape, Amnesia Moon).  <br />Blessed with any extraordinary imagination and a deft and persuasive writing voice, his better novels have the potential to be true iconoclastic masterpieces.  All have fallen frustratingly short of that mark however, though Motherless Brooklyn comes close to that status.  <br />The flaws are generally the same-too many major story elements that don't always mesh well, secondary characters that are a bit too much off the wall, too much dedication to the concept of the story as opposed to dedication to the story itself.<br />Nevertheless, when he's close to on his mark-as he is here-it can be compelling reading.  <br />Motherless Brooklyn takes the concept of the \\"misfit\\" detective to an extreme.  <br />Lionel Essrog is a detective in name only.  The \\"agency\\" he works for is in actuality a \\"gofer\\" shop owned by a man with loose mob connections that essentially runs errands for mobsters who want to keep things at arms length.  And Lionel's status within the shop is marginal indeed-he's the gofer for the gofers, largely because his Tourette's syndrome undermines his \\"usefulness\\" as others see it.  However, when his boss is killed Lionel becomes a detective in fact and seeks to track down the killer.<br />The story revolves around the workings on the fringe of the mob, religious cults and internecine family warfare, major story elements that at times are a bit out of joint with one another.  However, the characters are well developed, and while this is not a true \\"detective\\" or \\"suspense\\" novel in the traditional sense, the thread of the story is compelling and the suspense sufficient to the task, for the true object here is to see how a man with Tourette's syndrome, congenitally conditioned by both his disease and those around him to see himself as marginalized, overcomes all that to blossom into true, mature, fully engaged adulthood.  It is a fascinating and well-crafted exposition.<br />I can only hope that one day Lethem can put it all together and reach his ultimate potential-I have no doubt such an effort could only be described as a masterpiece. I hope I get to read it.	2002-01-22

In Water from the Well Myra McLarey reveals the soul and spirit of a racially divided community in Arkansas early 1900's. Through the stories of its inhabitants she explores the various ways in which religion, race, legend, community and personal relationships act to both keep the races apart-and at the same time binds them together. She shows how the character, soul and spirit of a place can transcend the various forces at work to shape it.  In the end one realizes that the story is in fact not really about anyplace in Arkansas but a place we all &quot;know&quot;--that mystical, ideal, imaginary place called home.<br />McLarey's style and craftsmanship is very reminiscent of that of Barbara Kingslover. It's a pity her work is not nearly so well known or recognized.<br />Water from the Well ranks as one of the two or three best books I've read in the last decade.  I highly recommend it.	2002-01-21

Hispanic writing today seems to fall within three distinct categories, i.e., contemporary fiction (mostly urban in context), historical fiction and mystical fiction.  With &quot;Spirits of the Ordinary&quot; Kathleen  Alcala has supplied us with an excellent example of the mystical genre  which is, insofar as I can assess, by far the most difficult and  interesting format to work with and master.<br />Set in the late 19th century,  the book essentially is the story of one man-born a Jew, married into a  large Catholic family, so estranged from both he lives essentially alone  prospecting for gold in the mountains of old Mexico-who eventually becomes  the equivalent of a shaman to and for the indiginious Indian communities in  Northern Mexico/Southern New Mexico.<br />Alcala hits the righ tone by  introducing her mysticim indirectly and in a low key--the requisite angels,  spirits and revelations are present, but are a complement to rather than  the focus of the basic story.  <br />The book exhibits flaws common to the  debut novel--sometimes disjointed, major characters a bit too out of focus,  minor characters given too much play, etc., but the genuiness of the story,  the aura of mysticims established, the overll quality of the writing and  the extraordinary bredth of the core characters more than compensate for  these weaknesses.<br />Overall, this was one of the best novels I'e read this  year and I highly recommend it.	1999-08-02

Having witnessed yet escaping the  brutal murder of his family by the fluke of happening to be in his favorite  hiding place at the time of the murders, he runs off and is ultimately  found by Anthos Roussos, a Greek archeologist digging in an area nearby  Joacob's home.  Realizing that the boy is in grave danger, Anthos abandons  his dig and smuggles the boy out to Greece.  Within hours of leaving, the  Nazis overrun the area of the dig and kill everyone associated with it.   Thus, in the first of many wonderfully crafted observations, Michaels notes  that, &quot;in effect, they saved each other.&quot;<br />This is the sort of  lyrical construction that fills a brillant book that works much better as a  lyrical prose poem than it does as a novel, as structurally the book is  seriously flawed.  The characters remain elusively imcomplete due to  haphazard breaks in the story line.  For example, though Jacob's second  wife obviously is the true love of his life, she has no significant role in  the narrative other than that of a shadow as, shortly after she's  introduced, the novel changes direction entirely, adopting a new  protagonist, Ben, who is trying to recover Jacobs papers after his death.   All rather awkward.<br />As a result, too many significant characters are  insubstaintial shadows, not the substantive elements of the story they  obviously shape but, in the structure of the book, don't really participate  in.<br />Frustrating though these structural flaws may be, and they are  frustrating indeed, Ms. Michaels nevertheless infuses this novel with such  lyrical, poetic allusion, such passion, and such a keen eye for spiritual  anomie that the book is, in the end, well worth reading and savoring.<br />My  hope is that future works will work better stylisctically and structurally  yet remain at the same overall level of artistic accomplishment as is  realized in this novel.	1998-08-23

Sam Hall is the town  vagabond--the kind of guy who lives on the edge, is constantly  on the  move, so immeresed in his own schemes and shennanigans he's hardly got time  for his kid.  As a result Sam's boy essentially raises himself and spends  his time wondering how his parents ever got this way, while flip flopping  form the &quot;care&quot; of one parent to the other.<br />What makes this  book work is that, flawed as the characters are, Russo nevertheless infuses  them with the souls of real people.  We can bemoan the fact that Sam's a  lousy dad, and not that great a person overall, but it's hard to get too  worked up about it as the fact is you kind of like the guy.  In fact, this  novel abounds in characters who are unsavory yet so brilliantly drawn and  presented, we feel we know them well, warts and all.<br />Additionally, Russo  is a master at rendering the landscape of the small town, painting a  picture that isn't all that attractive yet abounds in appealing context and  situations--that is, he makes Mowhawk feel like home feels, regardless of  where you grew up.<br />In the end, what one is left with is a story--a rarity  thses days.  The novel is funny, sad, insiprational, gross and  absorbing--in short, it's a lot like real life.  What makes it an  extraordinary story is that Russo pulls from it the extrordinary  revelations about life, love, loyalty, stupidity, passion and loss that we  ought to get out of our own lives but somehow don't.<br />A truly remarkable  book.	1998-08-23

She is now sufficiently free, however, to analyze her situation, as well as those of her classmates, and can see, if not overcome, the various results that these limitations and expectations have had on her and her various classmates. The effects are often severe:  Sexual abandon and the consequences those acts engender in a traditional, paternalistic society;  Illness (particularly anorexia); and, in the end, a particular act of revenge/release with very grave effects and consequences.<br />Although not a book for the faint of heart, this nevertheless stands as a extraordinary piece of storytelling and social/psychological examination of the anomie often engendered within families in our modern society.	1998-06-30

The Canary family turn the terms &quot;marginal&quot; and &quot;disfunctional&quot; inside out. Every member of this family has severe physical and/or emotional and/or psycological problems.  Yet, they still enjoy a rich family life that, in many ways, is defined by love, loyalty and devotion. And this fact is the underpining of this book and, probably, society at large.  For while they suffer mightily, they do so, largely, together and, in remaining together, forge the bonds that ultimately allow them to survive and, in some ways, flourish.<br />This is a rich, deeply spiritual book in many ways, though the prose can, and often does, take on a coarse, often vulgar character--again, a lot like life itself.<br />In the end, the books is a study of the difference between happiness and contentment in working through the difficulties of life.<br />I heartily recommend the book.  One is well warned, however, that at times the coarseness of the manuscript can be unsettling.	1998-06-20
US	53013845	RIPMAOOPPPZCN	0156000482	290633108	Arabian Jazz (A Harvest Book)	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Very moving, engaging story and characters.	Arabian Jazz recounts the experiences of an Arab-American immigrant family living in a depressed area of upstate Ney York.  The story revolves around the themes of family, race, marriage and loss as the two grown daughters of Matussem Ramoud, daytime hospiatal maintenance man and night time jazz drummer work through the pressures of work, family pressure to marry &quot;correctly&quot; and the loss of their mother early in childhood.<br />While I found the primary characters engaging and the story often moving, this book suffers, greatly at times, from what I'd describe as &quot;First Novel Faults&quot;.  Many of the secondary characters have no substance, or have substance but appear and disapper from the narrative in haphazzard ways.  The novel attempts to paint a picture of life in the community overall but does so in an inadequate, stilted manner at odds with the heart of the story.   Some of the personal confrontations are contrived and some of the characters come across as stereotypes.<br />All of those faults notwithstanding, the book nevertheless paints a vivid, moving picture of the immigrant experience, the difficulties inherent in interacial interpersonal relations and the groping for familial healing in the face of loss.  In the end, the power of the story, the realism of the primary characters, and the sense of genuine love that suffuses the narrative more than compensate for the technical problems that crop up from time to time.  I heartily recommend this book.	1998-05-26

Pig Tales tries to be a near-futuristic irony-cum-farce tale about France at the Millenium run by the ultra-right-wing, told from the perspective of a young lady who works in a &quot;cosmetics boutique&quot; which is in actuality a retail brothel.  The various transformations within French society are mirrored in, and symbolized by, the young lady's transformation into a pig.  The stream-of-consciousness writing style can be occasionally engaging, and the main character now and then exhibits a strong expository voice, but the book bogs down in an obsession with sexual expression and fetishes (the author is distinctly anally oriented)on the one hand and inept political symbolism on the other.  very frustrating to the reader as there definitely is a viable story idea lurking in the background, waiting to emerge, but shut away by the authors fixation on the young lady's professional goings on.  In the end, the stereotypes are so overblown that the irony is lost and the fixations on seual expression so dominating that any element of farce is buried beneath too many detailed descriptions of oversized femal buns.  This book is reputed to have been a &quot;literary sensation&quot; in France.  If so, it goes a long way towards explaining why the French invest so much time and energy in reliving their past glories.  If this is literature over there, then the term French Culture has taken on the aspects of an oxymoron.  A major disappointment.  END	1998-04-23

That's certainly what Lucy Patterson has tried to do.  She's spent most of her life running from Mormonism, a faith she never accepted and which, ultimately, cost her (at least indirectly) the life of her son; from her one true love, an accomplished,urbane, sophistoicate who saved her son's life as an infant; from the many disposable lovers that succeeded him;  and from her fiction, originally an oasis that has run dry. Finally in hiding alone in the pristine, isolated backlands of the deep northwest U.S., Lucy, alone at last, discovers that she can't hide from herself, either.  Offered the opportunity to take an expense paid luxury cruise as the resident author, Lucy is reunited with her one great love.  Together, they are forced to face the truths that they have individually been running from and which, with nowhere left to hide, they now have to face.  Most of this is presented through flashbacks by Lucy, now staying at a modest Motel in Las Vegas.  Lucy has brfriended a local hooker who has just discovered she has aids.  The evolution of this new relationship is the backdrop around which the flashbacks weave the story of her life.  In the end, Lucy, like all of us, comes to terms with the notion that control is a delusion, and that love, like everything else in life, is not usually what we want, but what we can make out of what fate has left us to work with.  Very well written, somewhat severe in tone and prim in outlook, this neverthess was a very compelling and engaging story that I enjoyed immensely.	1998-04-04

Simon Mawer interweaves the seperate stories of the lives of Gregor Mendel, 19th Century Monk and the unrecognized (during his lifetime, anyway) discoverer of the basic properties of genetics and Dr. Ben Lambert, Mendel's great-great-great nephew, world recognized leading-edge geneticist who's the  victim of a genetic mistake--he's an achondroplastic dwarf.   In juxtaposing the stories of the &quot;normal&quot; monk unrecognized as the genius he was and the highly recognized dwarf who yearns to be normal Simon Mawer has created a fertile groud for examining a broad rage of questions:  What is &quot;Normal&quot;?, courage?, accomplishment? What results from genetics as opposed to environment?   The two men sahre many real life situations (the sex starved monk, a not very religious or pious fellow who makes chioces based upon expedience rather than faith, who is involuntarily cleibate by virtue of his outward vocation, and Dr. Lambert, the largely sex starved dwarf who is involuntarily celibate due to his outward deformity) but by virtue of their circumstances are alloted very different ranges of choices by fate dealing with their situations.  A novel full of irony, philosophical questions and a trememdous trove of information about genetics as practiced in this modern age, Mendel's Dwarf is a fascinating book that will lead the reader to question his own definitions of &quot;normal&quot;, to see the effects of abnormality, both upon it's victims as well as upon society and the &quot;normal&quot; population in general.   A unique, entertaing, troubling and educational read.	1998-04-03
US	53013845	R2M2EYVN9DAVXT	0871131994	142387457	The Ginger Man	Books	1	17	30	N	N	Boring, insipid book about a worthless, loathsome idiot.	For the life of me I cannot fathom what others who rave about this book find the least bit engaging or inspiring.  The story revolves around one Sebastion Dangerfield, an alcoholic, congenital liar, irresponsible debtor and adulterous wife abuser with no moral values whatsoever.  When not engaged in the physical and emotional abuse of his wife and infant daughter he's either getting drunk and commiting adultery or getting drunk and feeling sorry for himself.  He has no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  Moreover, if there's any humor in this book it's being kept well hidden.  While I have read several books lately by such authors as Christopher Moore, Tibor Fisher and Louis De Bernieres that often had me laughing out loud, I barely even managed a chuckle through this pointless text.  It was only my rigid adherence to a policy of finishing every book I start that got me through this.  Without doubt, this was the absolutely worst book I have read in several years.  Don't be suckered by the fales hype for this abominations.  Give it a pass.  Reading the want adds in your local paper would be far more enlightening and, likely, far funnier as well.	1998-03-10
US	53013845	RWOG4AN7VX0XH	038097505X	416150558	Island of the Sequined Love Nun	Books	5	9	11	N	N	A rollicking, hilarious story w/ marvelous characters.	Christopher Moore ranks among the freshest, hippest, inventively comic literary voices around today.  In this, his 4th novel, we follow the trvails of Tucker Chase, reprobate pilot whose penchant for strong drink and exotic women leads him into involuntary employment in Micronesia for a doctor whose &quot;practice&quot; involves the harvesting of human organs from umwitting &quot;donars&quot;. Tucker's road to ruin, realization and redemption is an entertaining whirlwind involving Moore's usual cast of memorable, zany characters.  This book is somewhat less reliant on the supernatural as a mainstay of the plot mechanism (though this might seem an untenable statement to those not familiar with Moore's books as this story includes the presence of a talking fruitbat and the ghost of a WWII bomber pilot as central characters)while providing a broader cast of significan't, meaty characters to enjoy getting to know.  On the whole I'd rate this effort just behind &quot;Bloodsucking Fiends&quot; but solidly ahead of his other two books.  This represents the perfect vacation and/or beach read so long as you don't mind people looking at you while you laugh out loud while reading!	1998-03-10

This book represents a finely detailed vision of the surburban experince gone wrong.  A vivid sense of the macabre is employed to develop a rich texture and background for a surbaban scene slightly out of kilter, a place where handsome middle class homes are protected by ealborate, spike filled moats to keep the neighbors at bay.  Mr. Antrim has a cpmpelling and engaging writing style.  Unfortunately, the book flounders at times as Mr. Antrim seems unclear as to whether he's writing a satire or a farce and, therefore, characters either come across as too weird or, paradoxically, not nearly wierd enough.   In the end, one is left much more impressed with the authors vision than with the story itself.  That vision, however, is compelling enough to make this book a worhwhile reading experience	1997-03-22

Set in post WW II Hawaii, &quot;A Little Too Much is Enough&quot; chronicals the life experiences of a young Chinese-Hawaiian woman growing up in Honolulu from the perspectives of various members of her extended family.  A very rich, colorful, highly ethnic portrayal of Hawaii's development into a major tourist location and that development's effects on the native population.  Several core incidents and experiences are told, and re-told, through severl different voices and perspectives, yeilding a rich texture in which one comes to savor the totality of the experiene's effects on the entire Wong family.  Delivered in a highly vernacular Hawaiian voice throughout, &quot;A Little Too Much is Enough&quot; in the end stands as not just a wonderful story, but also as a rich, multicultural experience	1997-03-22
