The truth was built up, day by day, step by step, fact by fact, and can be found in SELLING SATAN (highly recommended).<br />Biblically, when we are caught in sin, it is the church's job to call us on it, call us to repentance, and &quot;out us&quot; if we won't clean our act up ourselves. Warnke says he didn't seek to gain wealth from ministry, and yet he states he focused &quot;on the bottom line&quot;...well, what is that if not focusing on the perks-=-money and expense accounts, etc.  He is vague about his failings--but SELLING SATAN will let you in on what those failings were so you will not be sold again by this seller.<br />Are there wounded in the church? yes. Can the church be too harsh? yes. Does God's love remain steady? Yes. In these areas, Warnke is right. BUT...as someone whose wounds were self-inflicted (by his unrighteous and disordered personal life and false witness), he cannot point the finger at his accusers, who merely brought light into a dark ministry.<br />I hope Mr. Warnke has renewed his spiritual and emotional life. I hope he does much good work for the Lord, in humility and the strength of the spirit, but I wouldn't recommend that any believer buy this book and support the ministry of someone who continues to deny the incontrovertible proof set forth by those in the body who could no longer tolerate his lies.<br />Pray for Mike, but don't support his pity party.	2004-07-19

Early this morning--around 5 am--I finished reading THE FACE OF GOD, after letting it sit in one of my TBR piles for months. I'm sorry I waited so long! :)<br />What do we have in this Christian fiction thriller? A pastor who outwardly seems like the perfect servant of God, but who, through tragedy and visions, sees that he's lost his first love, not just the literal one--his wife, but the Biblical idea of what this means. This, and the possession of an unusual green gemstone with Hebraic inscription, sets off a chain of breathless events, some exhilirating and some tragic, that all lead our main character to experience transformation, find illumination (in more ways than one), and see the God whose face is...well, read the book. :)<br />The pace is unrelenting. You will not be bored. The characters include all three major monotheistic religions--Judaism, Islamic and Christian. The setting moves from the middle east to Europe to Africa to the US. It's all over the map, but not haphazardly. The story is totally focused on the external journey (finding the 12 stones of the Levitical high priest's breastplate, plus the Urim and Thummin) which parallels the internal journey (from legalism to satisfying relationship). The ending is realistic, with some matters satisfyingly closed, and others interestingly open-ended. Muslim characters are treated with respect--not simply painted as all malicious, wild-eyed, bomb-carrying killers. In this current tense environment, that alone gets Mr. Myers a thumbs up.<br />The first novel of Mr. Myers that I read, BLOOD OF HEAVEN, was exciting, but it didn't have the heart, the really moving moments, that THE FACE OF GOD provides. I felt my own moments of real conviction about my own legalistic tendencies while reading this book. Im now on my own journey to recapture my first love and see the face of the Beloved more clearly, and reflect it better. Thank you, Mr. Myers.<br />I recommend this book to all believers--and not just Christian ones. :)<br />Mirones. :)<br />Mir	2003-03-11

Refreshing. The main character is fascinating--an outsider even among outsiders, but one who connects in friendship with those at every level of this spaceship society (religious, political, underworlders). Bartolomeo is a man deformed by genetics, repaired by prosthetics, and at core sensitive and moral. He struggles to play the political game presented to him, lives with a certain weight of loneliness, but he takes risks to do what he thinks is right. It costs him. But it always costs when you have to make the tough decisions, which our hero must in fighting against an unjust political system and then against a sadistic and enigmatic alien presence.<br />The alien menace (faceless and formless) is a great metaphor for evil. It's there, but you don't really understand it. You just try to fight it the best you can and survive.<br />I loved the growing relationship between Bartolomeo (our atheist hero) and Father Veronica (a true believer). It rounds out his character that he is someone who has the ability to be both tender and tough, calculating and vulnerable, skeptical but wondering if belief might not offer comforts.<br />The fact that the story is not completely resolved as far as the fate of the people of the Argonos annoyed me a little at first, then made sense. The questions that arise when one ponders the nature of evil and of the meaning of life are open-ended, they continue. We haven't vanquished evil. Many people are mired in meaninglessness. We live open-endedly---not really knowing how the tale plays out at the end. So, the ending made sense. There may be Eden or Hell as a destination. But the struggle to live, to find a place to call our own continues...<br />Then again, maybe a sequel is in the works to explain what is left unwritten. :)  I'd read it!<br />But if I had my druthers, I think I'd like leaving it with a bit of mystery.<br />Thanks, Mr. Russo, for a wonderful few hours entertainment and pondering....<br />*Mir*)  I'd read it!<br />But if I had my druthers, I think I'd like leaving it with a bit of mystery. <br />Thanks, Mr. Russo, for a wonderful few hours entertainment and pondering....<br />*Mir*	2001-08-08

I already have several of Gayle Wilson's Regencies on my keeper shelf--when she hits a home run, she hits it out of the park! Anne's Perfect Husband is a delicious read for anyone who is a big fan of wounded (physically, emotionally) heroes in a Regency settig, Wilson excels in this archetype--one she has employed various times in both her contemporary and historical stories.<br />Ian Sinclair is a noble man trying to do the right thing for an orphan, the child of the man responsible for Sinclair almost losing his life in the Peninsula War. He's alive, Ian is, but scarred and wounded and his life is precarious due to an ill-placed bit of shrapnel. Lucky for him in his loneliness, the orphaned daughter of his deceased foe is no child, but a gallant and nurturing woman. The story progresses as one would expect a Regency romance to do so---noble actions, attention to the marriage mart, and a bit of suspense added for good measure.<br />I had a grand few hours with Ian and Anne, and I recommend this novel to lovers of romantic tales with happy-ever-afters. I can only hope Gayle will soon delight us with another of her pleasant, heart-touching stories. More of those fabulous wounded heroes, Gayle!!!<br />*Mir*	2001-04-29

I hunt down, seek out and snap up anything that smacks of a retelling. That's why when I saw this title and read the blurb, I rushed to the checkout with this little book.<br />The ingredients were there--hero with facial deformity, lovely heroine who grows to love the ugly man with a heart of gold, an isolated setting. What was missing were really good heartfelt scenes between Alix and Lee (the B &amp;B). I kept feeling that I was being cheated of the deepest moments of emotion--the passion of the beauty for the beast and vice versa. There is a certain coolness in the telling, like the wintry countryside, and it left me...wanting.<br />For hard-core B&amp;B aficionados, I say you might as well read it, but don't expect everything to end lovely and beautifully with a HEA. Just enjoy another version of our fave tale.<br />BTW, if you haven't read Charlotte Vale Allen's NIGHT MAGIC, there's a wonderful B&amp;B retelling with correlation to Phantom of the Opera.

The situation of the walking itself----creepy, fascinating. There are harrowing moments as the relatives and the coroners deal with this phenomenon. What else works? The &quot;then&quot; part of the story set in the West, where witches form a place of refuge that is infiltrated by a very evil individual. The &quot;bad land&quot; is truly terrifying. Bentley did a great job of making this reader believe this is one place you don't even want to see from a distance!<br />What didn't work? The boring parts dealing with the protagonist's father's stroke. All that space should have been put to use in going further into the interesting homeless female character and into Isabella, a truly vicious creature. What else didn't work for me? The ending. It seemed needlessly abbreviated. (Trust me Mr. Little, by that point, we would have stuck it out through a true epic battle, good versus evil.) The ending was rushed and the villain too easily vanquished. For someone with the kind of power Isabella has, we expect to see some truly explosive and well-explained conclusion. Didn't happen.<br />I will indeed be reading another Little book. The man has got to have some of the most original and gruesome forms of death I've ever read. And he sets up some scenes with great atmosphere, but it's uneven. The menace doesn't permeate EVERY scene (and I even found myself skipping paragraphs in the middle, which should not happen if every paragraph COUNTED). Some characters were too easily dispensed with without using them to their full potential, I believe.<br />Also, there was a clear anti-Christian sentiment in the book. Gee, all Christians are evil persecutors or small-minded scaredy-cats or flat characters with no gumption. Witches, on the other hand, can be good or petty or evil (but if they're evil, by golly, there's a good explanation), but the Christians are mere two-dimensional tyrantsor weaklings. If that kind of treatment was applied to black characters as a whole or gay characters in toto, you'd hear the mighty roar of BIGOTRY or HOMOPHOBIA. Wonder why it's okay to make Christians cardboard cut-out villains in so many horror and other genre novels?<br />Perhaps The Revelation next.....let's see what he does with a &quot;preacher&quot; there. :D<br />*Mir*characters as a whole or gay characters in toto, you'd hear the mighty roar of BIGOTRY or HOMOPHOBIA.

I purchase almost any romance that follows the Beauty/Beast or Phantom/Christine archetype. I just love wounded, scarred, disfigured heroes and the women with enough depth and sensitivity to love them.<br />That said, this was a pretty good romance for readers who enjoy that kind of storyline.<br />The hero was ambushed, imprisoned and tortured while on Crusade. He had been estranged from his domineering father. He stays away from home, but ultimately returns and has his heart captured when he spies a lovely village woman combing her hair in front of her cottage. But he fears to expose his disfigurement to her and stays in the shadows, yearning. Meanwhile, the villain is out to destroy them both.<br />The story has a nice fairy tale feel to it. The author even opens up using a formalized syntax that says to the reader &quot;These are ye olde days.&quot; Never mind that the syntax isn't consistent and throughout the book there are a few anachronistic bits of dialogue that make one stop and go,&quot;huh&quot;?<br />Fortunately, this is a fast-paced tale with a truly repulsive villain (one-dimensional, fully evil, no redeeming qualities--which is not that odd in the romance genre, hence, forgivable for its two-dimensionality), a madwoman out for revenge and a hero with a tortured soul.<br />The above quibbles aside, this IS a page-turner, and if you enjoy medieval romances with &quot;beast&quot; heroes and can immerse yourself sufficiently in a love story so that small annoyances can be overlooked, then you will definitely enjoy the romance of Galen and Anne.<br />Why this novel does not get a higher overall grade from me is that the heroine's aggressiveness is just not believable. Middle ages, folks. Lord with the power of life and death. Growing up poor, a PEASANT, used to taking orders, AND A WOMAN, used to being commanded by father and those in charge. Yet Anne doesn't hesitate to talk back to nobility and to physically engage in scuffles with a warrior Lord. While we do see her engage physically and ably with would-be rapists--hurrah, for her!--those are lowlives and commoners, not the Lord of the Manor.<br />Also, the hero doesn't act very cunningly and cautiously when there is grave danger to the heroine towards the latter half of the book. He really does not come across as someone in control of his keep or his men...or terribly bright.<br />All that doesn't make me detract overly much from my final grade of  B-  because the writing is attractive, the story has a nice fairy-tale feel, the hero is brave and soulfully wounded, the heroine is loving and energetic, and the bad guy is really slimy and gets his comeuppance. I also liked the cranky housekeeper/cook. :)<br />I look forward to seeing what Ms. Poff does with her next romance. She's definitely got talent.

This small book, which comfortably fits a woman's hand, is  such a volume.<br />The cover welcomes you with a bouquet of pink roses and  golden lettering. The spine is a textured cloth. The endpages are  beautifully speckled with bits of pastels. The pages themselves feel  substantial, but are given lightness and beauty by the soft colors that  inbue the paper.<br />The format is just as pleasing: On the left hand pages,  you'll find Bible passages on specific promises, such as &quot;Promises to  Help You Learn From Others&quot; or &quot;Promises About Daring To  Risk&quot;.  On the right hand side is a brief passage to inspire you by  the likes of Luci Swindoll, Gloria Gaither, Liz Curtis Higgs and Elisabeth  Elliot.

But  that's fine, because these are still valuable spiritual voices. Don't  worry, though, for most of the entries are from well-known mystics  (Hildegard, Mechtild, Angela of Foligno, Catherine of Siena, Julian of  Norwich, St. John of the Cross.)<br />Some names were unfamiliar to me, but  pleasant to read nonetheless, such as Saint Isaac the Syrian, one of whose  entries could be a rallying cry for animal rights supporters everywhere,  and which enjoins charitable folks to pray even for demons and reptiles. :  ) Feminists will delight in Marguerite of Oingts cry, &quot;Jesus are you  not my mother?&quot;<br />Very welcome passages include some of the sayings of  the desert fathers (lovely, brief, instructive stories) and some pertinent  Scripture passages (excerpts from the incomparable Sermon on the Mount,  from the gospels of Mark and John,from the Revelation, and from the  writings of Paul).<br />It closes blessedly with a familiar passage from  Teresa of Avila, which, if you haven't heard it done musically by John  Michael Talbot, you ought to try and do so!-- &quot;Christ has no body now  on earth but yours, no hands but yours, no feet but yours, yours are the  eyes through which he is to look out Christ's compassion to the  world...&quot;<br />*Mir*	2000-04-07

I'm a longtime fan of Ms. Davis. She's written some of my favorite series romance novels that have &quot;imperfect&quot; characters. She handled amputees wonderfully in two previous books, and now she has a heroine of  whose type is not very common in the tiny-waisted, perfect bosom world of  romance: A plumper! Amen, sister! I look forward to the day when plump  heroines are common enough that the weight isn't the central conflict for  the heroine!<br />In any case, Layla has a sexy voice, but men go,&quot;Oh,  never mind&quot; when they see the large gal behind the killer voice. Ethan  is a successful man who's had a hard life--orphaned, raised his sisters,  worked to make a fortune. His conflicts tie in with Alzheimer's disease and  to certain unconscious qualms about Layla's size.<br />Alzheimer's is a major  issue in the story and, while it got a bit preachy in parts (like some  brochure for the disease), there were touching moments dealing with this  terrible affliction, which affected the lives of both Layla and  Ethan.<br />Ethan has got to be one of the most appealing heroes to ever grace  category romance. He's smart, he's hunky, he's friendly, he's chivalrous,  he's not sexually predatorial (thank heavens!), he's family-oriented, he's  loyal, he's generous, he's patient. What a guy!  If you don't love him,  your heart has gone on vacation!<br />Layla is no wallflower,whiny fatty.  She's articulate and athletic and competent in her career. She's sexy in  her bodacious way, and has charming insecurities. (Who wouldn't if they  were big in this thin-obsessed society?)<br />Ultimately, this is a very  gentle romance from Ms. Davis, who has written some pretty spicy,  fast-paced, suspenseful ones. The romance is believable in how it unfolds,  at a rather modest pace. The issues are handled well, although Ethan's best  friend is a bit of a one-dimensional stereotype of the anti-fatty, shallow  guy, and Layla's best friend is too good to be true. The scene where Layla  is about to confront her insecurity about lovemaking and consummate her  affair with Ethan is very touching in it's vulnerability.<br />That said,  there was too much sex crammed into the END of the book. This romance was a  gentle, modest one (you'd think SWEET) and then--bam!-- love scene after  love scene in a short space of time. It gave the novel a lop-sided feel. I  think one well-wrought love scene would have been much better, one dealing  with vulnerabilities on both sides, and reaching a satisfied, eased  consummation.<br />All in all,a nice category read from a dependable series  author, one with a heroine to make us plumpers feel cheering. :D<br />*Mir*e Layla  is about to confront her insecurity about lovemaking and consummate her  affair with Ethan is very touching in it's vulnerability.<br />That said,  there was too much sex crammed into the END of the book.

I liked it enough to trusth his editing work. Just in terms of the senses, the book (hardcover) is like a delicious hymnal, a small sacred place of its own, with deep purple covers, lovely design details on the  pages (yes, also subtle), and pleasing, legible font. (These are important  to me in poetry anthologies. I like to enjoy the WHOLE experience of  reading).<br />While I was already familiar with the work of Annie Dillard,  Denise Levertov, Richard Wilbur, and Kathleen Norris, this lovely  anthology--wonderful for savoring on beautiful afternoons with some tea and  cookies while sitting in my garden--introduced me to some new favorites:  Diane Glancy, with her Native American experiences woven powerfully into  Christian imagery; Naomi Shihab Nye, David Hopes.<br />While I would have  preferred more poetry and less prose, there are truly lyrical moments in  the prose selections. Linda Hasselstrom's &quot;Buffalo Winter&quot; has  this: &quot;After a hot shower, I slept until nine, dreaming of buffalo  bulls with gleaming horns and a glowing language that was not words; of  lifting shovels filled with snow, and breathing deeply of moonlight as I  drove dark highways. Always, something secret pursued me.&quot;<br />If you  value a sense of place, of living creatures, of the natural world in your  literature, try this graceful anthology. And if you can afford it, get the  hardcover. It satisfies the eyes and hands the way the writing satisfies  the mind and heart. *Mir*	2000-04-06

It's a time, place and phenomenon that is of interest to me. Usually, the books are on the scholarly side and require a bit of quiet, focused reading.<br />This book is a wonderful daily reader. It's divided into subjects, such as &quot;awakening&quot;, &quot;grace&quot;, &quot;atonement&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;, &quot;night of the soul&quot;. Short selections from a variety of mystics (Hildegard Von Bingen, Mechtild of Magdeburg, Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Avila, St. Clare, et. al) are then grouped under these headings.<br />While I gravitate to the more lyrical entries (the poetical ones, such as Mechtild's or Catherine of Genoa's or the wonderful Hadewijch of Antwerp) and to those by St. Clare and Julian of Norwich, there is enough of a variety of these fascinating women's entries to satisfy those with tastes different from my own.<br />Need to work on your humility? There are passages for this. Want motivation to pray? There are selections for this, too.<br />The great anchoress, Julian of Norwich, says of her visions: &quot;I lay still awake, and then our Lord opened my spiritual eyes, and showed me my soul in the midst of my heart.&quot;<br />These women lay bare their souls and their hearts, and this author has kindly given us digestible sections for our daily needs.

It's a feast. : )<br />A new poet for me was Frances Desmond (excerpts from &quot;Chippewa Music&quot;) and I wish there were more than 2 pages of her brief, subtle, lovely poems that made me think of Japanese haiku. A poet worth seeking out for lovely moments of reading like &quot;it will resound finely//the sky//when I come making a noise&quot;.<br />Who is generously represented? Frost, WAllace Stevens, W.C. Williams, Pound, H.D, Marianne Moore, Millay. T.S.Eliot!-- 14 poems and 50+ pages for his works.<br />There were other new names for me (I guess I&quot;m not as widely read poetically as I would like. As someone who appreciates spirituality in poetry, finding Anna H. Branch was a treat--&quot;Ye stolid, homely, visible things//Above you all brood glorious wings&quot; and &quot;It took me ten days//To read the Bible through--//Then I saw what I saw,//And I knew what I knew.&quot;<br />The unfortunately named Adelaide Crapsey nevertheless has poems of sober beauty and lyrical melancholy---&quot;Keep thou//Thy tearless watch//All night but when the blue dawn//Breathes on the silver moon, then weep!//Then weep!&quot; Glad to meet her at last.<br />For those who enjoy odd little pleasures, there are forty pages of poetry by that singular personage: Gertrude Stein.  &quot;I have tried earnestly to express//Just what I guess will not distress//Nor even oppress or yet caress&quot; --or how about?-- &quot;What do you think of watches.//Collect lobsters//And sweetbreads//and a melon,//and salad,&quot;<br />I'd rather collect poetry....to read while I eat that lobster and melon.<br />An enjoyable and varied collection for any American reader. It was rather more fun than Volume 2, but then, when you have Ezra and Gertrude and Wallace S. and VachelL. and T.S. and H.D., you are bound to have a ripping time.<br />*Mir* ENDerican reader.

Cummings to May Swenson	Books	4	18	19	N	Y	Sublime to Silly--an interesting century..cut short	I've added the two volumes of this anthology to my poetry collection. I'm enjoying the perusal of them greatly--some poets are fresh to me, some old familiars. A few...er...um...well, I wonder why the heck they're here! (The  gibberish of &quot;A Purplexicon of Dissynthegration&quot; and &quot;Mater  Dolorosa&quot;)<br />You can sing along to &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; or  &quot;Brother Can You Spare a Dime&quot;, revisit cummings' &quot;Olaf glad  and big&quot;,  or dive into the generous selection of the excellent  Elizabeth Bishop poems. I was pleased to see selections from &quot;The Love  Poems of Marichiko&quot;(Kenneth Rexroth). How delicious and sensual.  &quot;I cannot forget / the perfumed dusk inside the / tent of my black  hair...&quot; Langston Hughes is given a good amount of space, as is  Roethke (although I'd have been happy with MORE Roethke, personally).  You'll find plenty of Ogden Nash selections to remind you of why you loved  them so as a youth.<br />Of the poets unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed sampling  Genevieve Taggard:&quot;Try tropic for your balm / try storm / and after  storm calm./ Try snow of heaven, heavy, soft and slow, / brilliant and  warm./ Nothing will help, and nothing do much harm.&quot; (from &quot;Try  Tropic&quot;) Also unfamiliar was Hildegarde Flanner (&quot;Silence braided  her fingers in my hair / and put her ankles close to mine in bed...&quot;)  and Janet Lewis (&quot;A creature fresh from birth / Clings to the screen  door / Heaving damp heavy wings.&quot;)<br />It's such a shame that the second  volume didn't close out the century. Where's the rest of the century?<br />I  grieve the absence of three of my fave poets (Carolyn Forche &amp; Denise  Levertov &amp; Adrienne Rich). Somehow, an American poetry anthology  without Levertov just seems so unfinished. And expanding the timeline would  have allowed for some of the wonderful Latina poets to have a spot. Why not  represent the full Century?<br />Ah, well.<br />*Mir*	2000-04-05

He can't always do what he feels is the moral thing to do,  or the kind thing, but he tries to do what is right, despite the  odds.<br />Rhiannon is suppressing a horrid past. Haunted by nightmares,  trying to be a woman she thinks she should be to attain &quot;a safe  life&quot;, she is nevertheless drawn to this dangerous, passionate,  similarly haunted man--Ash Merrick.<br />The sexual tension is combustible.

I wanted so hard to give this a full five stars, because Osborne is just such a good writer. Your eyes skim smoothly through the prose, you stop and laugh out loud here, you stop to wipe a tear from your eyes there, your  heart gets all warm all over. She has such a gift, Osborne does, and her  greatest being that of creating unconventional heroines in hard-luck  situations who have amazing backbone and integrity, even when life stomps  them down a few times. You just have to love her tough gals!Unfortunately,  Osborne's villains do tend to be on the cardboard side--sociopaths with no  redeeming qualities. Yeah, I like my good guys to be good, and my bad guys  to be bad, but I like some subtlety, too. That's my main quibble with  SILVER LINING--which is nevertheless a terrific read and one I recommend to  all lovers of Western romance, or just plain romance in general. Low Down  will win your heart, no question!My other quibbles--a very shopworn cliche  plot situation at the end of the book which is beneath a writer of  Osborne's true talent. And a hero that is just not really an equal match  for Low Down. (Same problem in The Promise of Jenny Jones). I'd like to see  Osborne's next one give us a hero who is as gritty and tough and deep down  wonderful and well-drawn as the heroines she crafts.But I'll BUY that next  Osborne, just as I've bought all the preceding ones. The woman can write.  The woman can make heroines that make me want to hug them and make them my  best friends. It's a gift, I tell you. : )BTW..if your heart doesn't just  break over the things that happen with the spoon on the book's cover, you  need to check that ticker of yours. And if you don't laugh out loud several  times over the early scenes with the miners and Low Downe and the preacher,  or later on about the &quot;dawdling&quot; (inside joke for the novel's  readers), you're just plain &quot;daid&quot; inside, ma'am. *Mir*	2000-01-31
US	52956572	RVN5LLAOHPGM5	0764222562	353314718	The Ephesus Fragment (Blue Roge Legacy)	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Entertaining-needed fuller characterization, fewer bullets	Definitely a fast-paced read that would be appreciated by fans of Christian thrillers. The writer keeps the narrative going by quickly developing events. I can see this as an action flick, very visual.The main  protagonists, a Roman Catholic priest and a Southern Baptist female  diplomatic aide, are involved in the life-or-death search to recover a  newly discovered ancient manuscript that purports to be a new gospel from  the perspective of Mary, the mother of Jesus. It starts with a bumbling,  misfit archeologist finding the amazing fragment in a cave in Ephesus and  moves to the Vatican, to Cyprus, to Costa Rica, to parts of the U.S.---it's  a high speed chase of the global kind. Some want the manuscript for  financial reasons, others for religious, others for political, others for  professional, others for medical.The major flaw is the final battle--it is  over-the-top and illogical as a setting given what had come before in the  novel. The author could have delved more deeply into the theological  implications of ALL sides (not just the RC) and spent more time with  characterization to bring out transformations more effectively. It seemed  that the internal changes were INSTANTANEOUS, rather than logically  progressive.  Additionally, we have the old cliche of the bad guys being  all bad and simplistic. A little detail into the Arab honcho and the  Mercenary would have been most welcome. Good guys have flaws, so bad guys  should have merits for well-roundedness, or, if not virtues, at least a  more fully developed evil that slips out of stereotype mode.But, those  quibbles aside, it's a diverting read. Fast and rather fun. : ) I'd  recommend it on that basis, and would probably read another by the author  if the premise were of interest to me.Mir***	2000-01-06

Excellent characterization of both principals. For a novel that is mostly conversation (little action), it didn't bore me once. The conversation had a naturalness and sparkle, and I wished that it  were a BBC production so that I could see skilled actors in luscious  costumes in an elegant manse emoting subtly over their well-crafted  dialogue.At first, I thought I would dislike the plot --and Trevor. But it  quickly became apparent that this guy was a good soul trapped in his role  and in the ideas of what society approves/disapproves. He was a man who did  not know his own soul as well as, eventually, the heroine does. He THINKS  he's this brazen fellow who can just take what he wants, but what we see  and what is confirmed is this industrious, generous, sort of mushy  idealist. Yes, idealist: This is a man who actually believes in love and  wants to MARRY for love, and plans firmly to be a devout and faithful  husband. Talk about bucking Regency male ideas of sexuality even while  married!Trevor doesn't know himself;  neither does Clarissa. She isn't  aware of just WHAT she really wants in life--she thinks that respectability  and children will be enough, or a governess position and a quiet dutiful  life. But WHAM!--Trevor's presence and coming to know him over several  weeks show her that she has passion as well as virtue, that she has a  longing for good things, and genteel poverty isn't to her taste. She wants  the lovely clothes,the beautiful house, the passionate embraces, the  companionship of a kindred soul. The wonderful thing Farr does is show the  development of both Clarissa and Trevor as they come to that marvelous  climactic scene in the snowdrift stranded carriage. He wants her, loves her  so totally, that he'll cast aside his ideal of who is suitable wife  material and propose. Clarissa acknowledges that her wants have gone beyond  her previous notions,  and she's willing to sacrifice virtue for happiness.  And Farr handles it so well that we readers CAN believe they have genuinely  turned those corners in self-awareness.An excellent Regency novel in terms  of prose, characterization, dialogue and structure. The ending--where he  plans La Gianetta's comeuppance via granchildren--brings us back to the  beginning with a humorous twist. The book also has many small touches of  intimacy between Trevor and Clarissa that drew me in, made me feel like a  hovering spirit watching their interplay, and it felt cozy and warm.Most  satisfying. : ) My only regret is poor Mr. Henry.

Romance novels rarely  make it easy to fall in love and live peacefully. What's the fun in that? Ms. La Foy understands the idea of conflict and obstacles well enough, and she puts her talent to work in a love story  that, while not always utterly logical, is definitely a good read. The  heroine is not a simperer or a passive patsy. She's savvy of the mean  streets in which she lives and works picking pockets. She dresses in male  attire and knows what the rough world demands, while at the same time  having a heart that is tender enough to do whatever is necessary to  safeguard her fragile mother. She has dreams of a life out West, sans a  man. The hero is on a deadly quest to find a serial killer who has brought  nothing but pain and upheaval to his life. He's a man living with  nightmares.

I love romance novels, and I love historical romances best of all the romance subgenres, and this one is a pip! I didn't skim a single page. The heroine and hero surprised me at various turns in the plot. NOT a  predictable romance. NOT a wimpy or passive heroine. NOT a white knight of  a hero.The hero, Sebastian, is immoral, tormented, selfish, needy and  proud. The heroine is witty, clever, strong, determined, and perceptive.  When these two cross paths--the heroine is on a mission to remove her  nincompoop brother from the hero's sphere of hellish influence--it's  lightning and thunder and blood and guts (not always metaphorically  speaking). The plot zooms. Not a boring moment. You cannot help yourself  from turning the page, from delaying bedtime. Marvelous!Chase does a  fabulous job of probing Sebastian's tortured soul and mind. Even when HE  doesn't understand why he does things, the author and the heroine have  insights. And as the plot unfolds to a really touching AND funny  conclusion, you know you've encountered a master romance storyteller.If you  enjoy historical romances, if you like a plot that zings, if you are tired  of conventional heroines and heroes, do yourself a favor and read this  refreshingly surprising romance. *Mir*	1999-10-17

Edited for some typos and part of it \\"eaten\\" by Amazon.com The eaten bits are lost to my memory. OH, well:<br /><br />I expected to enjoy this novel. I love romances, the plot sounded intriguing, and a friend recommended it. (Granted, another friend said it was one of the worst novels she's read, but at least ONE liked it a lot).<br /><br />This is a weak book: The heroine is supposed to be this magnificent, strong creature, as the reader is oft-reminded. Every character deems her charming, elegant, spirited, priceless, dear, brave, etc.<br /><br />So what's the problem?<br /><br />Well, the reader doesn't see her *being* much of anything. She sort of floats around in a cloud of self-pity, a will-o-the-wisp of self-involvement, bemoaning over and over how she would be better off dead, that is, when she wasn't apologizing endlessly for being a nuisance to everyone for being ALIVE. I wanted to tell her, \\"Geesh. Give it a rest, woman.\\"<br /><br />Look, Balogh has written many fine novels. I've met Ms. Balogh, and she's very cool, very likable, quite bright, and I enjoyed her class. So, of course, I *wanted* to love this book and to like Lily.  I did. Lily had suffered a lot--so you get the sympathy factor. She was sweet to the poor tenants--an immediate draw, right? But then she decided rich folks weren't her type. Reverse snobbism, eh?<br /><br />But the main problem I had with her was this: Lily had no driving core. I expected her to be a woman of amazing strength,  because, for pete's sake,  she walked miles and miles to get to England to be with her \\"husband\\", Neville. That's no mean feat for a woman of her era. What does she do when she arrives? She's dominated by her insecurities, she behaves childishly, and she displays a weird lack of internal motivation. Instead of complaining how much she wishes she could read and play the piano forte, why doesn't this woman ASK to be taught. Why not DEMAND it as her right as a Countess. Oh, woe is Lily. The Lily in England is not the Lily who crossed borders to reunite with her love. Can we say \\"inconsistent\\"?<br /><br />Let's turn to Neville: Gee, fella, why don't you demand proof that your wife is dead? No doctor pronounced it, no burial was confirmed, no bones found. Just that he saw her shot and saw lots of blood. For a seasoned soldier, he's an idiot.  Blood and a wound don't EQUAL death. Every soldier knows that. One can recover from a bloody wound.  Later on in the book, he'll go to great lengths--or is willing to--to obtain a particular object. Too bad he didn't go to great lengths to find out his wife wasn't rotting in her grave.<br /><br /> The first couple of opening scenes are a total waste. First scene--no reason for it. None. The one with Neville and his fiance, we learn nothing about the fiance. Wasted chance at characterization. She isn't fleshed out until later. She SHOULD have been fleshed out early, so that when these two women--finace and Lily-- see each other face-to-face in the church, the import of what's going on is greater for the reader emotionally. We'd be invested, ya know?<br /><br /> There are some good bits, mind you--enough of them to keep one reading without total despair. Real feelings being expressed by the rejected, a family reunion that made me teary, a bad guy to add some interest to the mix, and one part where Lily does show some gumption, but it's not convincing. Sadly.  There is a Deus-ex-machina kind of resolution.A secret discovery is really so very helpful to tie up loose ends, ain't it?<br /><br />Maybe Lily did die...And got reanimated.

She writes heart-warming romances that just make me feel good. I felt good with this one, too. Austin is that particular species of Western male hero who is big  on honor and justice, and not always ruled by logic. He is more heart than  head. The heroine is good of heart, strong of conscience and lovingkindness  (hence the degree of her torturedness over an act she is hard-pressed to  live with). They end up filling the voids in each other --as couples will  in good romances.If someone goes into this novel primarily wanting the  who-done-it aspect, they're going to find the middle slow. Why? The book  puts romance FIRST, and the middle is mostly the unfolding emotional story  (with its attendant internal conflicts) of Austin and Loree. For romance  lovers, that fills the bill very nicely. The who-done-it doesn't take  precedence again until the couple is well-established. I would have given  it five stars if I really believed that someone would prefer years in  prison over telling the truth about a lover's tryst that might hurt a gal's  reputation. Sorry, but I can't buy it totally. No true self-respecting  woman and no brain-alive man is going to put up with torture and  deprivation for five years to cover up some youthful sexual escapade. But I  still loved the story and read it straight through til the end. I've read  all of Heath's TEXAS novels. They're all good romantic reads and I  recommend them to lovers of romance, particularly Western romances.I sure  hope Ms. Heath has a story coming for Rawley, the abused adopted son of  Dallas Leigh--the eldest of the three brothers.

Trust me: A fun read for lovers of  romance, and CERTAINLY for lovers of the Beauty/Beast type story (which *I*  am).This is the only book of Ms. Lynne's that I've read, but based on my  enjoyment of this romance novel, I shall surely seek more.*Mir*	1999-09-14

I'm giving this five stars not because it's some academically thought out review, nitpicking every sentence--almost nothing would get five stars that way--but because once I got several pages into it, I was totally swept into  the story of Firebird and her world(s). In terms of holding my interest,  making me adore the lead characters (who are fiercely courageous,  honorable, unselfish people with some aching needs that make them  vulnerable), making me want to know more about these cultures that Tyers  has created, making me hate putting down the book when I wanted to read  MORE.....on these terms, I'm giving it the full rack of stars. For romance  fiction lovers, there is a really beautiful love story. For action lovers,  there are air battles and sieges and special operations risking all. For  those interested in spiritual matters, there are religions, and they  actually affect the characters' choices. There is palace intrigue. There is  family dysfunction. There is redemption and hope.For those who object to  anything that smacks of Christian or Jewish theology, well, this book is  published by a religious publisher. Be open-minded. Just because the writer  has taken elements from the Judeo-Christian belief system to form one of  the two main religious systems in the story, this is not sufficient cause  to dismiss the novel. Let's beware of dismissing legitimate archetypes from  our own world being used in speculative fiction. Yes, she chooses to use  the terms &quot;Father God&quot;, an &quot;Eternal Speaker&quot; and  &quot;The Path&quot;. So what? Does that make the action scenes less  intense, the machinations less interesting or the characters less  well-drawn?Anyway, I've long loved SF. Be it the more accessible forms such  as Star Wars and Babylon Five or the more intellectual type such as Gene  Wolfe or Delany or Sturgeon. And I am also an avid reader of genre romance.  I like a good head story and a good heart story. I found a happy few hours  here and hope Tyers has a sequel planned.hope Tyers has a sequel planned.	1999-09-11
US	52956572	R1PTQCA2OAVL4H	0380805901	89486572	My Beloved (The Loved)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A marvelous medieval romance! A different kind of hero....	How anyone can find this sensitive medieval romance boring is mind-boggling. Is it because the author quotes Latin, Ovid and Catullus? Is it because the hero and heroine actually talk to one another, rather than  boink behind every tree in the forest or nook in the castle at the least  opportunity?Besides, how could I resist a book where the hero is so  enigmatic that the heroine's first words to him are, &quot;Are you  Death?&quot; : )If you enjoy the wounded hero type, a man with secrets and  great pains in his soul; if you like your heroines to grow in the story,  becoming emboldened and nobler in character; if you like to see people fall  in love credibly, step by step, before consumation, rather than just  lusting all over the chapters of a romance; then you should love MY  BELOVED. A glorious castle. A hero to break your heart. A heroine who casts  off her fears in the name of love and life and grows up. Secrets that  unfold. A plot that touches on the religious aspects of the time period. An  exploration of loyalty and doing what is right. But above all a delicious  love story.I have not read a medieval all the way through in a few years.  I'd become bored with how similar they were. This one is different, and I  thank Ms. Ranney for reminding why I once adored Medieval Romances so very  much.PS--I had read a Ranney historical before and didn't particularly care  for it, but was willing to give this one a try after it was recommended to  me by more than one person. I'm glad I listened. PPS--For those who LIKE  boinking in their books, this one has several very intense love scenes. Me,  I can do without so many pages of the details of conjugal bliss, but I  didn't want to leave the possible reader thinking this was a  &quot;dry&quot; romance. Oh, no. Interestingly, the sexiest, most  mouth-watering scene takes place in such a way that the hero never so much  as sets one finger on the heroine. A big &quot;Whoo!&quot;	1999-09-02
US	52956572	R23YICTZTDXXG5	0801010500	918276133	Politically Correct Death: Answering the Arguments for Abortion Rights	Books	5	5	7	N	N	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I bought two copies, one to share.	Mr. Beckwith has written at a level that is both intelligent and accessible to those without a degree in &quot;Arguments from Tolerance and Ad Hominem&quot;, &quot;Arguments from Bodily Rights,&quot; and &quot;Arguments from Theology in the Bible&quot; to name just a few. You'll want to peruse the epilogue called &quot;A Dialogue on Civil Disobedience--Socrates to the Rescue&quot; The appendices are nifty (and NOT dull!). My only criticism is that I wanted MORE information, MORE data..more of Mr. Beckwith's fine argumentation.This book is recommended by philosopher J. P. Moreland (whose books I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND), psychiatrist Patricia Wesley, M.D., Gary Bauer, George Will and law professor Teresa Collett, to name a few. As I said, it is well written, atractive in font and layout, and very helpful to those of us who still believe that life is sacred both in the womb and out of it, despite the ruthless political ideologies that insist otherwise. This book will give you a voice to defend the defenseless in a conversation or in a debate.BUY AN EXTRA COPY for your pastor, your friend, your Sunday School teacher. The )M. A.

I had gotten bored with romances after reading hundreds of them over the years. I needed a hiatus, clearly, from the genre, but Ms. Fetzer brought me back with a bang. From page one, something exciting is happening in the  plot. I didn't give it five stars because of a couple of quibbles--1.  dozens of really annoying typos. Who line edited this? They need to be  fired! 2. The conflict about having to take the criminal back to the future  is not compelling enough. She could just shoot the creep and go on her  merry way, with or without him. However, the hero and heroine are worthy,  tough, likable. I haven't run across such a seriously tough, kick-butt  heroine in a long time. She rocks. Warning--there's some pretty intense sex  for those who prefer the &quot;bedroom&quot; scenes tame or discreet.  Thanks, Ms. Fetzer, for a delightful time-travel romance. I will be looking  for your other novels.Enjoy, romance enthusiasts!	1998-12-13

A good man who needs love and doesn't know it; a fine woman who needs freedom and love, and knows it. : )  After reading the first of the TEXAS books, I didn't much care for Dallas, the cold fish. BUT....Ms. Heath, who has an absolute talent for making my heart warm and my eyes gushy, has redeemed this ambitious, empire-builder and given her readers a story full of what we want--good people, true love, obstacles to overcome, and an ending requiring a handful of tissues.<br />All I can say is BUY Ms. Heath's romances! ALWAYS TO REMEMBER is high on my romance keeper shelf, as is PARTING GIFTS.  I am eager to read Austin's story in the next TEXAS book. I hope Ms. Heath's editor gives her the go-ahead to write two more: the story of that sexy preacher and the story of the boy-waif in this latest novel. &lt;fingers crossed&gt;<br />Mir Schultz	1998-07-23
