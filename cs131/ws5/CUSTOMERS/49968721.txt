He wants to make the best for his daughters and ensure that they are never without.  Cedric is a little overanxious where money is concerned, but it takes Iman to show him that money does not always mean happiness and there is more to life than money.  Love can also mean happiness and security.  Iman turns Cedric's life around with just the soft whisper of words, until he says, &quot;Whisper To Me.&quot; <br />&quot;Happy New Year, Baby&quot; was great.  It covered the political and social issues involving a city that brought Shani Moore and Eric Aucoin together not only in the public, but also in their private lives.  Shani and Eric had to deal with events that left their personal lives upturned.  Could their new found love withstand the obstacles they were faced with involving community action or would their love slowly dissolve as the old year goes out and the New Year comes in with a bang? <br />&quot;Happy New Year, Baby&quot; was a wonderful story.  Loved it, Ms. Emery.	2002-01-21

The stories in \\"Something to Celebrate\\" are truly wonderful!  I loved reading all of them.  I was moved by Kia Simmons' story in \\"The First Noel.\\"  Kia was a dedicated woman, who because of an earlier tragedy in her life, she was not up to celebrating the holidays.  Kia had lost all the joy of the Christmas season, as well as her spiritual belief.  However, she was devoted to her nephew, whom she raised from a baby after the death of her sister.  It is during this Christmas season that Kia meets the love of her life in the form of Franklin Williams.  Franklin not only comes into Kia's life as a love interest, but Franklin brings faith, worship, joy, and a renewed spirit into Kia's life.  \\"The First Noel\\" was short, but sweet.  Kia could not have found love and hope in a better place! <br />\\"Kwanzaa Kupendi\\" was another touching story.  Michelle Craig could not have asked for or been given better friends than Loretta, Reba, and Clarissa.  Nor could she have developed a more devoted relationship than with Simon Stevenson.  Michelle has a lot to deal with regarding her past and her family relationship, but her friends are there for her.  Through their dedication and friendship, Michelle comes to realize that life is worth living and love makes it even better.  <br />Now, for Brenda Jackson's story, \\"Truly Everlasting.\\"  It is 'a forever love.'  Love has a timing effect.  Felicia Lavern Madaris has already decided to change her flighty ways and settle down to become the perfect mother to her young son.  However, looks can be deceiving.  Felicia has changed her attitude, but not her dress appearance.  She is still an eye catcher to the men, especially with some of the daring outfits she wears.  \\"Everlasting Love\\" is Felicia's and Trask Maxwell's story.  Trask not only comes to Felicia's aid, but comes into her heart as well.  Their love blossoms into an everlasting love.  <br />Ms. Jackson has done it again with the Madaris' clan!	2001-05-08

I have finally been blessed with receiving a copy of Francis Ray's out of print book, &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot;  I first read Ms. Ray's book, &quot;The Bargain&quot; and later Ms. Ray's books about the Taggart/Falcon saga, when I discovered she had also written &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot;  As an avid fan of Francis Ray's, it became a must to read.  <br />Now, for the review of &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot;  I devoured this book in less than a day's time span.  Reading it was a breeze.  Brad Jamison was tall, dark, handsome, and Michelle Grant considered Brad her 'fallen angel.'  Michelle fell under Brad's wings years earlier and although their meeting was brief at that time, the memory had a lasting effect for Michelle, who was in dire need of an angel at that time.  To Michelle, it seemed as if Brad had truly fallen angelically from the sky and come to her aid.<br />Brad is a tough businessman, who had some difficult childhood experiences despite having wealthy parents.  On the other hand, Michelle had worked herself from a teenager into a mature, sophisticated adult and a shrewed real estate agent, who also views herself as her brother's Nick's protector.  Nick was an athlete with a promising future and career, until a freak motorcycle accident changed his life.  Now Michelle feels obligated to Nick, a paraplegic, who had previously stood by and been there for Michelle.  However, Michelle's, Brad's and Nick's futures are now intertwined when Michelle and Brad fall in love.  Michelle, who wants to do something that would benefit Nick's life and career, could also have a devastating effect on Brad's life and on Michelle's and Brad's lives together.  Ms. Ray has combined the story to where the readers will wonder if Michelle will make the right decision and if so, will it be a timely decision? <br />&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is about love, trust, and commitment.  It is a beautiful love story.	2001-04-27

She was not whiny or squeamish when it came to blood.  She was not only a perfect assistant for Doc, but she was also a perfect mate for Doc when all was over.  <br />Now Doc was portrayed as a rugged Texan, but he was a kind and considerate guy.  Tough, when needed, but compassionate when need be.<br />Standoff was about two teenagers, Sabra and Ronnie.  Young and in love but Sabra's father, rich and domineering, did not approve of the match and was even more disapproving when Sabra and Ronnie sprang the news that Sabra was expecting a child.  They become two desperate teenagers on the run, caring only about getting away from Mr. Dendy.  It was rewarding to know that Sabra and Ronnie had people that really cared about their situation -- Tiel, Doc, FBI agent Calloway, Ronnie's dad, Mr. Davison, and Gladys and Vern.  Sabra and Ronnie were two scared kids in the standoff with the hostages.<br />The elderly couple, Gladys and Vern, were a spry couple.  They showed spunk in the time of the standoff.

Whatever your style, it was there -- Christmas, Kwanzaa, and the New Year.  The Christmas novella &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; was a heartwarming story of renewing an old romance.  It dealt with forgiveness as well as believing and trusting.  &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; was a chance for Elizabeth and James to recapture the joy and romance that was shattered.  It was a chance for Elizabeth to discover the love that she thought was buried with the death of her sister, Claire.  &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; was right in tune with the Christmas spirit of love, joy, hope, and sharing.  &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; was a beautiful and moving story.<br />What can I say about Aler's &quot;First Fruits?&quot;  I love Rochelle Alers' books and this novella was no exception.  It was rewarding to see concern for the younger generation and Marshall Graham's actions to steer the younger male in the right direction with the operation of Nia Academy for males.  Marshall set out not only to have the academy in operation, but to cover all aspects of learning - academically, as well as socially, -- in learning english, math, history, art and dance.  I praise Marshall for being the sort of guy set on making a difference and making it happen.  Shelby Carter, Marshall's love interest, would handle the art aspect at Nia Academy.  However, Shelby had not only captured the art contract, but she had also captured Marshall's heart.  When first introduced by Marshall's aunt and Shelby's friend, Naomi Morrow, it was a love interest at first meeting for both of them.  It was not easy and there were some misunderstanding, but eventually, their love did flourish and the romance came to harvest.  &quot;First Fruits&quot; was a rewarding novella that was not only informing with the information about Kwanzaa and the Kwanzaa celebration, but it was a wonderful romance about two people deserving love and each other.  Great story, Ms. Alers!<br />Angela Benson's &quot;Friend and Lover&quot; was my favorite.  This was a hilarious story of two people with truly a loving friendship.  Reed was a guy who knew how to take matters into his own hands.  He moved into Paige's apartment after the Christmas holiday and before the New Year's holiday and into her heart for life.  Paige was a wonderful girl, who agreed to play Reed's game of being engaged.  But was this only for Reed's grandmother's sake, or did Paige really have a motive of her own?  Was she missing something in her own life that she saw when Reed and Grandmother Lewis came to visit?  Where was the spark between Paige and her fiance', Dexter?  The sparks ignited when Reed kissed Paige or was near her, but she could not remember anything like that in her relationship with Dexter?  If you have not read this one, then you must read it.  It is not only funny, but touching.  I am sure that you will enjoy it.	2001-01-14

Samantha, aka &quot;Sam,&quot; was hired as a combination housekeeper, babysitter temporarily, but only until Christmas.  At least, that is what Ethan told the twins and Sam, as well as himself.  However, it was much too late for all of them to abide by this decision.  Each was starved for the other's affections and each had become too attached to give up.  The twins, not only saw Sam as their housekeeper/babysitter, but they saw her as a friend.  She could play ball and was not afraid of their dog.  The twins' affection went deeper still.  Although they were in contact with their grandmother, they were still minus a mother figure.  Sam with her winning ways, not only because she was a good cook and let them help her in the kitchen, but because it was who she was, had become special to them and they wanted her with them full time.  Not only had Sam become special to them and the twins had become special to Sam, but Sam had also affected the twins' dad.  Ethan's feelings for Sam were more than that of an employer, more than that of a friend.  Somehow, in that short time, Sam had imbedded herself into Ethan's heart.  Was he willing to allow a new love interest into his life or was he still shadowed by the deceit and experience of his ex-wife and the deceased mother of his twins.  Ethan thought he had a solution to the problem when he reluctantly agreed to keep Sam, &quot;but only until Christmas.&quot;  However, love does not have a set time to go away.  Therefore, until Christmas, turned out to a lifetime of love for Sam, Ethan, Alan and Alex.  &quot;Until Christmas&quot; was the best.  Way to go, Ms. Ray.<br />&quot;Kwanzaa Angel&quot; was a sweet remembrance into the past with a chance to correct the future.  Erin had been hurt in the pastby Raimi, who had reentered her life.  Would Erin give in to her feelings that never dissolved for Raimi and become involved in a new relationship or would she revert back into the past?  &quot;Kwanzaa Angel&quot; was about the Kwanzaa celebration, but with a twist of love for Erin and Raimi.  Good story.<br />&quot;'Round Midnight&quot; was about the New Year's celebration.  I loved the story of Dr. Summer Lane, the psychologist who now has a job at the radio station as a counselor on the air.  Her show airs around midnight.  It is at the radio station where Summer meets Tre Holland, one of the bosses.  Everyone thinks Summer is a snow or ice maiden because Summer stays to herself and does not socialize with the others.  However, Tre is attracted to Summer and sets out to melt the snow.  Summer also has feelings for Tre and wants the ice to melt from around her heart.  However, after getting together, somewhere while the ice is melting another freeze comes along and the ice around Summer's heart becomes another block of ice.  Summer and Tre suffer heartship and are temporarily separated.  Tre sets out to recapture Summer's love and to permanently melt the ice.  He knows a new year will be approaching and is determined to be in Summer's life when the new year begins.  So, he sets out around midnight to make it happen.  Will Tre succeed in his endeavor?  Read &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; and see what the New Year has in store for Summer and Tre.  Great story with just the right amount of heat.	2001-01-14

The story was romantic, with a twist of fun to it.  I could visualize the story:  Jessi Rose working on the ranch, trying to keep the ranch going after the murder of her father.  Her nephew, Joth, coming home from school, to help with the chores, then his homework.  Griffin &quot;Griff&quot; Blake, the hardened criminal, released from prison to help Jessi Rose and Joth keep their ranch from falling into the hands of Darcy.  Griff's friends add spice to the story.  They are outlaws that are tough and hard when they need to be, but they are also funny. <br />Jessi Rose Clayton is known around town as a hard woman, especially after her experience with Outlaw Bob.  Griff is known as an outlaw and train robber.  Between the two of them, Jessi and Griff, make quite a team.  Jessi needs to be tamed and Griff needs to settle down.  Their experiences lead them into a romantic interlude.  Jessi's claws are less sharp and Griff's roaming days are slackened.  &quot;The Taming of Jessi Rose&quot; is a good and a fast read.	2001-01-14

Clarice Jarrod, a school teacher, comes to town and moves into a house that is supposedly haunted.  Clarice meets Tylan Chance, when Clarice takes her car to the garage.  Tylan becomes attracted to Clarice, but at their first meeting thinks she is a little too pushy.  However, a friendship develops.  Not only friendship develops, but so does a romance.  <br />&quot;White Lightning&quot; is striking.  When I first was introduced to this book, I thought it was about a thunderstorm, with streaks of lightning.  It does not involve a weather thunderstorm, but there is lightning.  The kind that erupts from a romantic touching of wires, but not from the atmospheric tensions.   <br />&quot;White Lightning&quot; has a hidden suspense that when it is uncovered will reveal the 30 year mystery of the haunting of the house Clarice lives in.  When the mystery is uncovered, it will also provide a better understanding as to the name for this story.  However, the suspense does not overshadow the romance between Clarice and Tylan.  The haunting of the house is what makes the storyline better.  Clarice and Tylan are drawn together more and more because Tylan feels protective towards Clarice.  Lightning does erupts, but slowly between Clarice and Tylan as their wires touch.  <br />&quot;White Lightning&quot; is indeed striking and a romance with just enough suspense to make it even more romantic.	2001-01-14

There was not much romance mentioned.  What little romance was overshadowed by the suspense.  The first couple of pages begin the suspense when the two mysterious strangers dump 'John Doe's' body.  After Daisy discovered 'John Doe' in the compost pile, the suspense continues upon discovering that 'John' has amnesia and does not know who he is.  Throughout the book, Daisy and 'John Doe' were trying to solve the mystery.  There were references of books and TV shows which were mysteries.  &quot;Simply Wonderful&quot; was in the same category - a mystery.  The little romance involved a kiss or two by 'John Doe' upon Daisy's lips, a roughly stolen kiss by Chester by which his lip was bitten, and finally at the end of the book, reference to a love scene between Daisy and 'John Doe', who has now discovered his true identity, Kenneth Gunn, a private investigator.  The title of the book, &quot;Simply Wonderful&quot; was based on Daisy's experience since meeting Kenneth and the excitement and intrigue of searching for his true identity and the reason for his being dumped on Daisy's property.<br />&quot;Simply Wonderful&quot; was a good book, but perhaps should have been catergorized as a mystery or suspense book.  This is the first book I have read by Ms. Lewis, but understand she is working on another book scheduled to be released in August, 2001.  Perhaps the next book will hold true to its category of romance.  I look forward to reading it.	2001-01-05

David thought he was in love with the heroine, Amy Thompkins, a penniless widow with a young baby.  However, when Jason met Amy, Jason fell instantly in love with Amy.  Not only was Jason a blessing to Amy and her young son, Max, but Amy was a blessing to Jason.  His character was changed from a hard, uncaring fellow into a loving and generous guy.  Some parts of the story were funny, but overall the story was uplifting.  Amy was a dedicated mother, who did not want charity and eventually realized her worth and this too was partly through Jason's doing -- so there is another blessing.

Cheryl Faye's characters Lena Caldwell and Quincy Taylor were life like.  The reader could almost see Lena's shy smiles and actions, as well as see Quincy's smashing smiles  and fine body.<br />Lena's parents, both now deceased, had kept Lena sheltered  while they were alive.  Excitement for Lena revolved around coming home,  curling up on the sofa, and reading a romance novel.  Four months after  Lena's mother died, Lena's life changed dramatically.  Lena blossomed from  an innocent 25 year old virgin into a mature woman.  Lena's fantasies of  love and romance that she read in novels began to come true in her life the  moment Quincy stepped off the elevator and walked into the reception area  of the bank where Lena was the receptionist.<br />Quincy's life changed also.   His horoscope for the day he first met Lena came true.   Quincy became the  man of Lena's dreams, but as with dreams, once you awaken from your dreams,  you must face reality.<br />For Lena, reality was Quincy's ex-fiance', Rhonda,  who suddenly shows up and expects to pick up where she so rudely left off.   Rhonda's return brings about several changes.  Her return causes Quincy  world to turn upside down.   Will Quincy be a man and live up to his  promises he made to his new love, Lena?  Or will Quincy succumb to Rhonda  and try to rekindle the past?  What about Lena?  What effect will Quincy's  actions have on Lena and their new life together?<br />Ms. Faye has the reader  wondering if Quincy will live up to the man that Lena and others think he  is or if Quincy will put Lena through what he once suffered at Rhonda's  rejection.  <br />Also, Quincy and Lena's friends, Serge and Karen make a  great couple.  There could have been more feedback on Serge and Karen, but  perhaps that could be the making for another novel.  <br />The novel could  have had a more detailed ending, but overall &quot;First Love&quot; is a  great book and it is a fast read!The reader will not want to put the book  down until it is finished.  &quot;First Love&quot; is indeed rated a  five-star book.	2000-07-31

Madelyn - a strongminded, stubborn, prideful woman -  who is the perfect match for the strong willed, but oh so lovable Daniel  Falcon.

Their passion was not as fiery as Kane's and Victoria's, or tantalizing as Matt's and Shannon's, nor as steamy as Daniel's and Madelyn's, but nevertheless, each person has a  different character.  Therefore, the story will be different.  In  Dominique's case, she had been burned by love before, and there was the  situation with her abusive marriage.  Also, Trent had been duped by his  fiancee' and was leery of getting involved in another relationship.<br />All  in all, Ms. Ray has created another masterpiece.  &quot;Break Every  Rule&quot; is above reproving.  &quot;Break Every Rule&quot; is Dominique's  and Trent's story and is well worth reading.  <br />I do hope Ms. Ray would  continue Trent's story involving his parentage.  I would love to know the  other side of Trent's untold life.  <br />Looking forward to other readings by  Ms. Ray as I am a great fan of her writings.	2000-07-23

This is the second set of frontier series I have read written by Linda Lael Miller.  &quot;The Women of Primrose Creek&quot; are truly courageous, bold, and intelligent.  I am eagerly awaiting the fourth book to this  series.<br />The main character, Skye, also the name of the book, was a feisty  woman, but stubborn.  Skye refused to admit her feelings for the man she  loved and just waited so long to express her feelings to Jake Vigil.  Everyone in the town could see that Skye and Jake were in love, except the  two people it mattered the most to -- Skye and Jake.<br />Jake had been bitten  by what he assumed was love on two other occasions, one time with Skye's  cousin, Christy McQuarry, who later married the town's marshall, Zachary  Shaw.  Jake was a little shy at admitting his feelings now.  Maybe not shy,  but a little reluctant to fall into the trap again.  Although in the end,  he and Skye, could not deny their love.  They marry; Skye becomes a mother  to Jake's son, whose mother abandoned him and sent him to live with Jake.   Later, Skye becomes an expectant mother, and Jake is to become a father a  second time. <br />Each book in the series gets better than the one before.   It is like a new chapter unfolding in the lives of the McQuarry women.  &quot;Skye&quot; is about a woman who is determined, yet independent.  Skye  does not discuss her feelings with Jake, which sometimes causes confusion,  as in the scene where Skye contacts the railroad company without telling  Jake.   He in turn thinks of this as an act of betrayal on Skye's part.   Then the fire nearly destroys the town, but the people of Primrose Creek  are determined to rebuild.  All in all, love and determination win  afterall.<br />I think it is wonderful the way Ms. Miller enfolds the lives of  all the McQuarry women in each book of this series.  The reader gets a view  of what is happening to the others and how their lives are shaping up.  The  McQuarry women may be apart, but they are stillone family.         I am  looking forward to the fourth book in this series.	2000-07-14

This was my first book by Doris Johnson.  Ms. Johnson expressed the issue of  organ donation from two views -- the importance of organ donation, as well  as the negative views regarding organ donation.<br />Diamond was a sincere  person.  She had negative  views against organ donation, but proceeded to  see how an organ recepient lived after being awarded a precious gift and  given another chance to survive.<br />&quot;Precious Heart&quot; was a  learning experience.  Not only did Diamond have to cope with losing her  beloved mother, but with knowing the receipient of her mother's heart.   Diamond became embroiled in the receipient's family's matters.  Diamond and  Steven fell in love.  She became a mentor to Steven's teenage niece, and an  assistant to Steven's mother, the heart receipient.<br />&quot;Precious  Heart&quot; was about life, caring, and most important of all -- love and  the gift of sharing.<br />Good book, Ms. Johnson.  I look forward to reading  other books by you.	2000-07-14

Ms. Emery has done it again.  &quot;After All&quot; was just that -- AFTER ALL what else is there?  <br />The past has a way of coming back to you - sometimes if it is only in your dreams.  However, with Michelle Toussaint,  the past came back to her big time, not in her dreams, but in the flesh --  in the form of the six-foot-two Anthony Hilliard.<br />Years ago, Michelle  thought she had hardened her heart and put Anthony out of her life due to  their families' misfortunes.  However, love has a way of coming through and  overshadowing even when we think we know what is right. <br />In a way,  Michelle blamed Anthony for her father's financial misfortune.  Both,  Michelle and Anthony, felt bound by family ties.  However, in order for the  two of them to rekindle what they once had, they each had to cut the ties  that were binding them.<br />Michelle's job as a reporter gave her the  opportunity to get the &quot;goods&quot; on Anthony's uncle, Ike, which  would eventually destroy Ike and may well damage Michelle's newfound  relationship with Anthony, as well as Anthony's career and his perspective  of Ike.<br />Anthony's Uncle Ike is Anthony's mentor.  All of Anthony's life,  Anthony has believed in, trusted, and looked up to Ike.  Yet, Michelle was  about to destroy that trust.  Would Michelle's actions in turn, destroy  Michelle's and Anthony's chance to start anew and revive their feelings of  the past?  Anthony was willing to start over.  Michelle wanted to, but was  afraid the old hurts would resurface.<br />Michelle would soon learn that  Anthony's family is not the only one to blame for what Michelle thinks  nearly ruined her father and upset the Toussaint's happy home.  Michelle  would eventually come upon the truth that not Anthony, nor Ike, nor even  Michelle's father is to blame for part of the problem.  Michelle would  realize that her mother is a part of the problem as well -- in fact half of  the problem involving Michelle's father and Ike Batiste.  <br />&quot;After  All&quot; is about love, trust, hurt and pain.  &quot;After All&quot; is  about uncovering secrets that some would say would be better left buried,  yet, the scars cannot heal, if the truth is not revealed.  &quot;After  All&quot; is about setting one free after the truth is told.  &quot;After  All&quot; is about facing the past and embracing the future.  &quot;After  All&quot; is about Michelle Toussaint and Anthony Hilliard.  Two people who  had to put their families' issues aside, accept what happened in the past,  learn from it, then continue in the future, and let their love for each  other help heal the wounds of the past.  AFTER ALL what else does two  people do who are made for each other and destined to be together, except  forget the past, learn from life's mistakes, and embrace the future.  <br />&quot;After All&quot; was a great book.	2000-07-14

A great story about two wonderful people.  Carmel Matthews had the nerve, as well as the sense, to realize that true love is just that -- true love.  Love does not hurt and love is not unkind.   Love is not based on how much an individual weighs or what an individual  looks like.<br />Although Carmel was a full figured woman, she was still a  beautiful person -- not only on the outside, but inside where it really  counts.  Carmel realized that she had to accept herself as she was --  weight and all -- if she was to respect herself and see herself as she  wanted others to see her.  Not only did Carmel's views affect herself, but  her issues with her weight affected her family members also.  Her daughter  started seeing herself through Carmel's eyes and it almost resulted in ill  health.  However, through love, everything worked out.<br />Now, about Dr.  Steve Reynolds!  WOW!   Dr. Steve turned out to be just what I thought he  would be -- one kind, considerate, and nonjudgemental brother.  Sure, he  had a negative thought or two about Carmel's weight, but he was not  thinking as himself, but Steve was thinking as others would think.   However, Steve did not hold those thoughts for long.  Steve knew what he  wanted and went after it -- Carmel, along with her baggage -- her weight!   <br />Ms. Jackson really captured the essence of true love in this one.  It  should be an inspiration to women, not only to the full figured women, but  every woman.  Everybody is somebody and if we will just be ourself, we can  survive.  As the saying goes, &quot;If life gives you lemons, then make  lemonade.&quot;  <br />For the full-figured women out there, if you are  feeling low or discouraged and you have not read Monica Jackson's &quot;The  Look of Love,&quot; get a copy, sit back, relax, and enjoy.  It will truly  be an enlightenment to you.  And ... for those of us who are not  categorized as &quot;full-figured,&quot; this book is still an  enlightenment.  It lets us know that we are not the only females in the  world that can turn a man's head -- even a fine man such as the likes of  Dr. Steve Reynolds.  Keep your chin up girls! <br />Again, good work, Ms.  Jackson!   A true eye opener!	2000-07-13

I love reading all types of books and I felt this book was one on the top of my list.  I thought the characters were great together -- the strong- willed Alexandria and the  dashing Thorne.  They were made for each other even though both tried to  deny their true feelings.  The plot was great.  I have read other books by  Ms. Ray that are wonderful also.  I would like to see a sequel to The  Bargain with a storyline involving Thorne's sister, Judith, and perhaps The  Shadow or Lord Stonewell.  I think Judith showed courage and will not let  her handicap hinder her from finding true love.  Judith is a character by  herself and deserves her own story!  Please keep this in mind, Ms. Ray.   Again, all of your books are great and I look forward to reading more of  your books.	2000-07-11
