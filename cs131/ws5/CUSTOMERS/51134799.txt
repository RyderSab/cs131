Zeba Crook's premise is that the key to understanding ancient conversion is &#34;benefaction&#34;, or what is gained, as opposed to introspective soul-searching. With trademark Context-Group gusto, he undercuts the cross-cultural psychology that assumes all people share the same psychological structure underneath a veneer of cultural difference. The cultural divide between Mediterranean and Western people results in psychological differences that bear on the question of religious conversion.<br /><br />While the academic field has generally heeded Krister Stendahl's pointer that Paul didn't have a bad experience with Judaism and the Torah, it has not heeded his more general claim -- that Paul wasn't introspective. People in antiquity converted or chose gods for the same reason they chose patrons, based on the benefits they stood to gain. The &#34;balance sheet&#34; was what mattered in ancient conversion: &#34;what's in it for me&#34;.<br /><br />Crook discusses various rhetorical conventions that occur in the context of this &#34;balance-sheet&#34; psychology, including: (a) the unanticipated call of the patron, who gives the client a benefaction; (b) the honoring discourse of prayer, praise, and proselytism -- the last of which was expected of clients so as to publicize the generosity of the patron, in an attempt to increase the honor and reputation of the patron and attract new clients (the more clients the patron has, the more honor); (c) patronal synkrisis, by which the client feels compelled to compare his inferior past to the superior present, to the credit of the patron; and (d) the grace received by the client (though &#34;benefaction&#34; is a better translation than &#34;grace&#34;, since the latter is loaded with post-Reformation overtones; rather than abstract ideas of love and mercy, grace referred more often to a concrete item of benefaction or patronage).<br /><br />The author shows that Paul's own rhetoric of conversion (in I Cor 9:1; 9:16-17; 15:8-10; Gal 1:11-17; Philip 3:4b-11) owes precisely to these conventions of patronage and benefaction, so it's all the more surprising that introspection and other western psychological models continue to play a role in interpreting Paul's conversion.<br /><br />Of particular interest is the way missionary activity is understood in this context. Paul's evangelism was nothing more than client-reciprocity, reflecting his obligation to publicize Christ in return for the benefaction Christ gave him. All clients were duty-bound to publicize on behalf of a benefactor, in order to increase the benefactor's honor -- as Paul puts it, &#34;Woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel.&#34; (I Cor 9:16) Paul wasn't so much trying to save souls as he was trying to gain converts in order to increase his Lord's honor.<br /><br />The phenomenon of synkrisis helps us understand how Paul's new religious convictions related to his native ones. Crook shows that in order to credit benefactors, clients almost always described their past as grim and bleak in comparison to the present -- except in cases (like Paul) where the patron doesn't change, in which case they &#34;raise the stakes&#34; by improving upon an already excellent past (Philip 3:4b-6) which in comparison to the present is actually worse than worthless (Philip 3:7-11). Paul's Jewish heritage had been a source of pride for him, but in comparison with new revelations based on what Christ offered him, that heritage seemed like excrement.<br /><br />This is not only a helpful basis for understanding the relationship between Paul's twin sets of convictions, but it provides a springboard for making sense of Paul's contradictions elsewhere. Crook argues that Paul, as a result of converting while still following the same deity, maintained a tenacious loyalty to the traditions of his forefathers, subject to a strict loyalty to the Christ movement:<br /><br />&#34;[In Romans] Paul seems to be constantly making a point, then back-tracking,working himself into a corner, then fighting to get out. In each case, this has to do with the value of the law...Paul is struggling to express loyalty to God in a new way (law-free salvation) without expressing disloyalty to God for the previous gift of the law...How can Paul argue that the law was a benefaction from God but that the supersession of it was also a benefaction from the same God? These are the issues of loyalty, which are the result of a conversion that involved the same divine patron, that Paul is struggling to work out.&#34; (p 246)<br /><br />Some prefer that Paul was &#34;called&#34; rather than &#34;converted&#34;. But Crook points out the false dichotomy: by the time of Hellenistic Judaism it was possible to be called and *thus* converted. Paul indeed expresses his conversion in terms of a call or commission, but that's the language of patronage/benefaction. He was invoking the Greco-Roman example of the call of the divine patron-benefactor (&#34;conversion&#34;) and the call of the Hebrew prophets at the same time.<br /><br />This book shows that Paul's conversion was anything but unique. He followed the general pattern of conversion found everywhere in the Mediterranean. Once again, the balance sheet was the important factor -- &#34;what's in it for me&#34;, not vocation or inner fulfillment. My only quibble is that Crook refuses to speculate on what Paul actually gained from Christ. What *was* in it for Paul? What was the benefaction he received? Was it simply the revelation (vision) itself? The promise of favored status which would somehow play out in the end (as the twelve disciples are reported as being promised in places like Mt 19:28/Lk 22:30)? Perhaps Crook wanted to leave this a mystery for others to solve, but given that he devotes so much space to Paul as his chief example, I felt a bit cheated here. But quibbling aside, this is a terrific book, another accomplishment of the Context Group whose members continue to help us understand the ancients on their own terms.this has to do with the value of the law...Paul is struggling to express loyalty to God in a new way (law-free salvation) without expressing disloyalty to God for the previous gift of the law...How can Paul argue that the law was a benefaction from God but that the supersession of it was also a benefaction from the same God?

In 1906 Schweitzer indicted first-quest scholars for making Jesus over in their self-images. Now, ninety-nine years later, Arnal is indicting third-quest scholars for making Jesus into a symbol of contemporary discourse. \\"Scholarship uses the figure of Jesus as a screen or symbol on which to project contemporary cultural debates,\\" and the acrimony connected to the issue of Jesus' Jewishness masks hidden agendas.<br /><br />Arnal acknowledges agendas on both sides of the field -- from those championing a \\"Jewish Jesus\\" (Sanders, Fredriksen, Vermes, Allison, Meier, Wright) and those promoting a more \\"non-Jewish Jesus\\" (Funk, Crossan, Patterson, Horsley, Mack, Vaage). But the weight of accusation falls on the former group. Though my own sympathies lie with this group, Arnal isn't being unfair, just exposing agendas which have been less transparent than usual. The latter group have clear agendas which repeat the mistakes of the past, rewriting Jesus in order to validate liberal Christianity -- or dispense with the pesky religion once and for all. This is old news. The agendas of the former group are more difficult to get a handle on.<br /><br />But Arnal nails down these agendas with enviable acumen. Those aggressive about Jesus' Jewishness may be driven by:<br /><br />(1) -- the agenda to save one's scholarly soul from the legacy of German Lutherans. Sanders, Fredriksen, Vermes, etc. have paved the way to a new and distinctive Anglo-American scholarship, free of Bultmannian influence.<br /><br />(2) -- the intent to save one's political soul from any taint of the Holocaust. The Jewish Jesus approaches a stereotype of modern Jews, thereby reclaiming (or insulating) Christianity from complicity in the Shoah.<br /><br />(3) -- the need to keep one's religious sensibilities intact. A Jewish Jesus, ironically, helps maintain a distinctive Christian identity and can even reinforce supersessionism (in cases like Wright and Witherington).<br /><br />(4) -- the goal to preserve one's cultural identity in the face of postmodernism. A Jesus who believed in Torah, the temple, and purity is a formidable weapon against the erosion of social identities, in effect insisting upon cultural stability.<br /><br />However important these agendas are in themselves, the author (rightly) maintains that Jesus, as an historical figure, should have nothing to do with them.<br /><br />Arnal doesn't particularly like the \\"Jewish Jesus\\", which perhaps makes it easy for him to spot the agendas associated with it. I'm the opposite, and see through the likes of Crossan and Mack right away. So we learn from each other; no one is agenda-free. Reconstructions of Jesus need to be defended for the right reasons, in either case.<br /><br />This is a nifty book that, while containing objectionable inferences along the way, makes the reader ask the right questions for the right reasons, just as Schweitzer's classic did a century ago. But is Arnal right to conclude that the quest for the historical Jesus should again be abandoned? Of course not. We need the historical Jesus for history's sake. But he's right that Jesus isn't needed to justify covert agendas and make us feel secure about ourselves.- the goal to preserve one's cultural identity in the face of postmodernism.

He was made to write a book like this. Most responses to The DaVinci Code have come from defensive evangelicals, but this is a refreshing analysis by an expert.<br /><br />It's sad that a critique like this is even necessary. Are people so gullible that they can't recognize sensationalism when they see it? Apparently not, especially when Dan Brown misleads them by claiming that \\"all descriptions of documents\\" in his novel \\"are accurate\\" (page 1 of The DaVinci Code). Ehrman sets the record straight: (1) Q is not a scandalous document concealed by the Vatican (?!); it's a hypothetical source which many scholars believe contained material common to Matthew and Luke. (2) The Dead Sea Scrolls are not Christian documents; they are Essene. (3) Gnostic gospels like Thomas do not present a more human Jesus than the gospels of the New Testament; just the opposite, they present a more divine Jesus. (4) Indeed: \\"The oldest and best documents we have for knowing the life of Jesus are the four gospels of the New Testament. This is not simply the view of Christian historians; it is the view of serious historians of antiquity of every kind, from committed Christians to hard-core atheists.\\" (Ehrman, p 102)<br /><br />But this book is more than just a catalog of Dan Brown's stupidities (the word is not too strong). It's an elegant tour through ancient sources and teaches us about the historical Jesus, the historical Mary, apocalyptic Christianity, gnostic Christianity, various Christian views of women and the \\"divine feminine\\", and what really happened at the Council of Nicea. (As any student of Christian history knows, the gathering at Nicea was not, contra Brown, to decide whether or not Jesus was divine; everyone believed that, and had believed it for centuries!)<br /><br />People like to learn history through entertainment, and this is a good thing. We should rejoice at the attempts of novelists and film directors to bridge us with the past. Parke Godwin's Sherwood is a superb novel penetrating through the myths of Robin Hood -- fiction, to be sure, but based on plausibility and accurate depictions of figures like William the Conqueror. The same is true of Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles (about King Arthur). And I even liked Mel Gibson's Passion, despite its own historical problems. But Dan Brown's DaVinci Code is silly beyond measure -- as silly as it is popular. It isn't based on anything remotely plausible. It owes to fantasy, a misrepresentation of ancient documents, and a crackpot theory (Jesus married Mary Magdalene and sired a \\"Holy Grail\\" lineage) discredited back in the '80s.<br /><br />Ehrman's book is accessible, fun to read, and part of a growing trend in scholarly responses to religious novels and films. It's sure to interest people further in a subject they would otherwise have never thought to pursue. For that reason alone we can thank Dan Brown for writing such a laughable novel.ng.

I often tell people that if there is one book to read about Jesus, this is it. Dale Allison develops Schweitzer's apocalyptic prophet in view of millenarian movements, outlining 19 characteristics shared by apocalyptic groups and cargo cults -- all of which happen to fit the Jesus movement like a glove. He gets Crossan out of the way in chapter one (not a difficult task), and then explains the advantages of Sanders over Borg. Mistaken prophecies like the temple's destruction and replacement (\\"in three days\\"), and Judas Iscariot's reign over one of the twelve tribes of Israel, point to authenticity. Against Caird and Wright, the author shows that Jesus' apocalyptic language, about which he was wrong, was intended literally. He locates Jesus as an ascetic (a celibate), a notion many people find as unattractive as eschatology. Allison concludes: \\"Jesus was the millenarian prophet of judgment, the embodiment of the divine discontent that rolls through all things; the prophet of consolation and hope who proclaimed the last would be first, making the best of a bad situation. But his generation passed away, and they all tasted death. Like all apocalyptic prophets, he was wrong; reality took no notice of his imagination.\\" This is Schweitzer's legacy, and those who fight it are swimming against the tide.<br /><br />The author doesn't mean to imply that Jesus was wrong about everything. There's wheat and chaff in anyone's religion. Jesus empowered people socially while misleading them eschatologically. He was wrong about the apocalypse, but perhaps for the right reasons, wanting God to defeat evil, redeem the world, and hold humanity responsible. This is one of the few studies that allows Jesus his human inconsistencies and failings, and for that reason alone convinces.	2004-10-30
US	51134799	RTDZZRL8IPGMJ	082647781X	987117424	Jesus and Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ: The Film, the Gospels and the Claims of History	Books	4	15	19	N	Y	Where history ends and myth begins...	This is a good book for anyone interested in how Mel Gibson's film relates to the Jesus of history, and the editors generally take the right approach: \\"We should not impose what we want Gibson to do with his movie but rather seek to understand, appreciate, and critique what he has done.\\" Aside from one contributor (Crossan), the twelve authors do a fairly good job of this.<br /><br />The first part presents two overviews of the film written by John Dominic Crossan and Mark Goodacre. Differences in tone, reason, and sanity cannot be overstated. Crossan's is a sanctimonious indictment and hard to take seriously, with preposterous overstatements found on every page: \\"If this film is not anti-Semitic, no such film can ever be made.\\" In fact the film is no more anti-Semitic than the gospels, and considerably less so than Matthew and John. \\"Any Christian who accepts the Emmerich-Gibson theology of vicarious atonement is trapped in support of pornographic sadism.\\" While the violence is extreme and the gore a blood-bath, neither is gratuitous. The subject matter demands them. Pornography encourages the viewer to want more, and the film does precisely the opposite. In effect Crossan serves as the foil against which Goodacre radiates sound judgment. The latter's essay is easily the book's finest: well-organized, well-written, explaining why the film can offer a powerful vision to Christians and non-Christians alike.<br /><br />The second part is half the book and deals with particular subjects: the flashbacks (Robert Webb), the character of Judas (Scot McKnight), the figure of Satan (Mark Allan Powell), Mary and the women (Kathleen Corley), the Jewish leaders (Alan Segal), the Romans (Helen Bond), the trials of Jesus (Glenna Jackson), and the procession/crucifixion (Craig Evans).<br /><br />Webb thinks the flashbacks are key to comprehending Gibson's vision: \\"without them the film would be a pointless gore-fest\\". I disagree. The flashbacks are unnecessary and distractive given the film's focus. And Jesus' passion isn't pointless; the context is supplied by familiarity with the gospel stories. I agree, however, with Webb's conclusion that Gibson's use of the flashbacks is \\"problematic and inadequate\\", not only because they insufficiently communicate the significance of Jesus, but because the viewer's own image of Jesus can provide all the framework one needs. Gibson's snapshots are too brief and superficial. In any case, Webb's individual commentaries on the flashbacks are helpful.<br /><br />McKnight explains why Judas' betrayal and suicide is likely historical, while his demonization in the film is mythological though dramatically effective. Powell argues that the androgynous and alluring figure of Satan, while not exactly true to the gospels (let alone history), is a well-used and convincing representation of evil. Corley corrects Gibson's association of Mary Magdalene with the adulteress of Jn 8, and opines that both Marys should have been in the flashbacks with the disciples -- since historically they were disciples too.<br /><br />Segal's objections are fair and considered (unlike those of Crossan) but misplaced. He believes the film is anti-Semitic for portraying the Jewish leaders under Satan's sway. Historically the priesthood had very good reasons for having Jesus arrested: he was stirring up crowds during passover, and he acted against the temple. Messianic movements (of which there were a variety) and threats against the temple could easily get one killed in Jesus' day, and these would certainly account for an historical passion more than any mythological reason owing to Satanic influence. Segal is obviously right. But Gibson's film is Catholic myth according to Emmerich, not history according to E.P. Sanders and Paula Fredriksen. Controversial as it is, Satan's power over the Jewish leaders must be understood as foreordained in the context of this myth: \\"They act as the chosen people prepared by their whole history to carryout the ironic rejection of God, even as they defend his name. They persecute Jesus out of a righteousness given over to Satan for the time being, so that the battle Christ fights alone can be most intense: it is against his own.\\" (Glenn Arbery, film critic)<br /><br />Bond explains why the film's portrayal of Pilate is a blend of history, gospel apology, and artistic imagination: the real Pilate would have been callously indifferent to Jesus and killed him without second thought. Jackson observes many historical problems with the film's (and gospels') trial scenes. Evans gives a superb analysis of the relationship between the historical procession, the gospel route, and the medieval stations of the cross before turning to the crucifixion and what this terror entailed in the time of Jesus. He notes in conclusion that the early Christians would have been puzzled by Gibson's focus on passion instead of resurrection -- since Jesus' suffering and death was important as a prelude to the more climactic vindication by God.<br /><br />The third part wraps up with contributions from W. Barnes Tatum, David Goa, and Robert Webb, who discuss the artistry of the film. Finally, editors Webb and Corley conclude that while Gibson's use of a harmonizing trajectory with the four gospels can be fairly expected (as in most Jesus films), his use of Emmerich is problematic on levels of both history and theology. That Emmerich is unreliable history is a given. That her theology is problematic amounts to a subjective claim which cannot be resolved by editorial appeals to modern sensibilities such as: \\"In a world where violence is seen as the answer to social and political problems, and where violence is glorified in various media, to suggest that God requires equally extreme violence for the salvation of humankind, is, to say the least, problematic.\\" This is an inadequate response to the question of suffering in general and atonement theology in particular. Still, the editors have done an invaluable job of providing a useful handbook for those wanting to know where history ends and myth begins in Gibson's film.as they defend his name.

It is normal, natural, and pervasive. It is not, as popular opinion would have it, reducible to mental illness or moral failure. Human society is a network of lies and deceptions that would collapse under the weight of too much honesty.&quot; (p 2)<br /><br /> David Livingstone Smith has written a stunning book with four aims in view. First, he explains deception and self-deception from an evolutionary perspective, how lying to ourselves soothes the stresses of life and in the process helps us lie efficiently to others. But in order to deceive ourselves, we had to evolve an unconscious region of the brain where truth can be effectively obscured. This ties with the second aim of the book, in which Smith attempts a controversial reconnection between cognitive psychology and the kinds of questions Freud once tried (unsuccessfully) to answer. Like it or not, the unconscious is a reality which must be addressed. Freud may have left us a legacy of crackpot pseudo-science, but some of his findings can be legitimately applied in scientific investigation. Smith gets us started on doing exactly this, and hopefully some of his ideas will be pursued at more length -- and more empirically -- by the scientific community. He uses examples from modern living in describing (the third goal of the book) adaptive functions of the unconscious mind implied by self-deception, showing (even if without the level of empirical proof demanded by scientific inquiry) that we are all natural psychologists, albeit unconscious ones, carefully monitoring one another's behavior, constantly deceiving others and ourselves. This may sound like a wild idea, but it's not. For the author demonstrates (the fourth objective) that our conscious and unconscious perceptions of others are disguised in the gossip, lies, deceptions, and veiled meanings in everyday conversations.<br /><br /> One emerges from this book feeling almost like a paranoid schizophrenic. If indeed we tell three lies for every ten minutes of conversation; if indeed we are constantly, and often unconsciously, aiming hidden missiles at people with coded transcripts and veiled meanings; if indeed we are natural born liars with &quot;bodies that secrete deceit&quot;; then the conclusion presses in the opposite direction of received wisdom. Psychiatric professionals teach us that mentally ill and depressed people are self-deceived and out of touch with reality, but evolutionary biology corrects this mythology. Depressives have a better grasp on reality than then most people, because they suffer from a deficit in self-deception. Smith wryly remarks that self-knowledge isn't all that it's cracked up to be.<br /><br /> Smith concludes that we know far less about ourselves, and far more about others, then we are aware of knowing. While acknowledging that we can hardly be taught not to deceive ourselves -- even if we could, it would only result in unhappiness -- we can at least work to rid ourselves of surplus self-deception. But that's easier said than done. In any case, this book is one hell of an eye-opener, and a delight to read. It should be mandatory reading for gnostic-thinkers, who will hate it.this book feeling almost like a paranoid schizophrenic.

In the earlier letter, Paul was opposing Judean outsiders; in this letter he attempts to reconcile both Judean and Gentile insiders. Social theorists tell us that such recategorization can be successful only when the different ethnic groups have equal status in different ways -- since if they were equal in the same way, they would continue to compete in a fashion destructive of unity.<br /><br /> So, for instance, Paul claims that just as Gentiles are under the domain of sin without the Torah (1:18-2:5), Judeans are under its power with the Torah (2:17-3:20) -- and the transition passage stresses the impartiality of God in punishing members of each ethnic group at the judgment, &quot;the Judean and the Greek&quot;, those under the law and those not under the law (2:6-16). Likewise, just as Gentile believers have been liberated from the power of sin which ruled them as immoral pagans (6:15-23), Judean believers have been liberated from the power of sin which ruled them through the law (7:1-25). Judeans need to recognize that Gentiles are God's elect and heirs to the promises of Abraham (9:1-11:12), but Gentiles need (even more) to understand that their benefits are a means to an end -- to provoke Judeans to reacquire what is really theirs (11:13-32). The point here is that Paul's success depends on careful attention to both ethnic groups, taking them down in different ways, but without erasing their ethnic identities in the process. That's why the last thing he wants to say is, &quot;In Christ there is neither Judean nor Greek&quot;, as he did in Galatians.<br /><br /> This also accounts for Paul's treatment of Abraham in Rom 4 and the Torah's purpose in Rom 7. Abraham is a prototype for Judeans and Gentiles who have faith, against the polarizing implication of Gal 3:6-9 that Judeans have been disinherited. He became circumcised in order to seal his faith-righteousness, precisely in order to become the ancestor of two different ethnic groups (4:11-12). And the Torah is holy and passive in its relationship to sin, against the perverse claim in Gal 3:19-26 that it actively confined people under sin. Sin used the law to its advantage, and the Torah, though given for the promise of life, was unable to do the job God gave it (7:10-11). This may raise questions about God's competency, but it exonerates him of perversity.<br /><br /> This is the book on Romans I've been waiting for, even if I still like Mark Nanos' particular treatment of Rom 14:1-15:13 better than anyone else's. Thanks to Esler, we can now appreciate Paul's most famous letter through the eyes of those who inhabited the strange and distant world of the ancient Mediterranean. We see Paul's eschatology as forthcoming-present more than future (Rom 8:18-39). We catch a glimpse of Paul as the victim of slander and gossip (Rom 3:8), the malicious &quot;weapon of the weak&quot; which crippled people's honor on a daily basis. We appreciate the dual occasion of the letter -- Paul's impending missions to Jerusalem and Spain, intersecting the ethnic crisis in Rome -- and how the two are truly inseparable. And we see Paul the Middle-Eastern all too familiar with the hostile nature of gift-giving, whose collection for the poor (Rom 15:28) was a slap in the face to his colleagues in Jerusalem, who really did &quot;feed the hungry in order to heap burning coals upon the heads of others&quot; (Rom 12:20).<br /><br /> Paul was on a battleground when he wrote his letters, reinterpreting scripture in legitimately offensive ways, in line with the canons of honor-shame. Esler has explained these battles (for both Galatians and Romans) with especially insightful uses of anthropological and social theory, which serve us better than thought-pattern theology or literaryintertextual approaches. There's a wide chasm separating us from the biblical world, and only when we acknowledge it can we begin to build bridges. Esler's epilogue reminds us that there is a strong need for such bridges in today's world: &quot;Romans reveals its connection with the taproot of human experience in relation to violent ethnic conflict in the world.&quot; This is a far cry from the way Augustine or Luther read the letter.

His book thus comes as a refreshing alternative to defensive Christian interpretations like Bradley Birzer's &quot;JRR Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth&quot; and Ralph Wood's &quot;Gospel According to Tolkien&quot;.<br />Readers should be aware, however, that Wright has an aggressive evangelical agenda. The subtitle, &quot;sifting the gold from the glitter&quot;, hints at the angle he's coming from. He warns that pagan elements in Tolkien's story need to be recognized for what they are -- glitter not gold, chaff instead of corn. Needless to say, one person's gold is another's glitter, and in truth we should recognize both pagan and Christian elements as part of the &quot;gold&quot; of Tolkien's classic.<br />Wright is correct, however, to point out that Tolkien thought he had chaff in his own corn, even if we as readers are not inclined to recognize it as such. From a Christian point of view, there is too much &quot;long defeat&quot; in Middle-Earth, and never enough confident victory. The Fourth Age grows even darker than the previous cycles, and men have to confront evil without help from wizards and cheerfully courageous hobbits. As the apocryphal dialogue between Finrod and Andreth indicates, the race of men remains hopeless without the Christ event. But the flip-side to Wright's observation is equally important: Tolkien couldn't do without this chaff, and he even liked its taste. He loved and emulated pagan themes like hopeless courage, even if as a Christian he couldn't quite &quot;go there&quot;.<br />The best parts of the book are the last two chapters which focus on the Fourth Age and alternate Catholic ways of viewing Tolkien's work. Wright is sensitive to Catholic doctrine (rare for an evangelical) and has done his homework. He cites Regina Doman's excellent contrast between the Protestant and Catholic views of history, the latter of which puts The Lord of the Rings into perspective as an historical episode consistent with Christian salvation-history. The heroes of this story are &quot;faithful&quot; to the extent that Eru has revealed himself to them. But ultimately the pagan world-view is operative in Middle-Earth, and Frodo was doomed to failure.<br />Wright and I come to similar conclusions for very different reasons, but the important thing is that he understands Tolkien's story for what it is: pre-Christian myth as opposed to Christian metaphor. For those who can wade through the evangelical chaff, Wright's corn is worth its weight in gold.t and Catholic views of history, the latter of which puts The Lord of the Rings into perspective as an historical episode consistent with Christian salvation-history.

It's rather heavy-handed and one-sided, but Ralph Wood is admittedly no slouch. Unlike most Christian readings of Tolkien's classic -- vacuous and devoid of substance -- this one stands as a refreshing reminder that informed studies relating to the author's Catholicism are possible. Wood's thesis is that while much of northern paganism is honored in Lord of the Rings, Christianity resounds through it on a deeper and more profound level.<br /><br />Wood believes that Tolkien's story is \\"deeply Christian for not being overtly Christian\\" -- meaning that since God discloses himself through Israel and then Christ, there can be no other way to reveal Himself directly save through the Biblical Story. Lord of the Rings, therefore, can only reveal Christian truths subtly, without allegory or abstract moralizing. He also ventures that Tolkien's story is \\"pre-Christian in chronology but Christian in content\\" -- that the story is set in pagan pre-history, yet anticipates later Christianity by disclosing (covertly) the principle claims of the Christian faith. Pagan brutality and grimness is alive and well in Middle-Earth, but Tolkien's protagonists rise above this by demonstrating Christian virtues such as mercy and hope. (Wood even argues that the apocryphal debate between Finrod and Andreth anticipates the resurrection of Christ and the human race.)<br /><br />While Wood makes a fair case here and there, he pushes his thesis way too far. I would say that Lord of the Rings is pagan both in chronology and content, even if it does occasionally hint at \\"greater things to come\\". Tolkien was a devout Catholic, but he admired the Scandinavian epics and pagan folklore which he devoted his life to studying. He emulated (and wrote about) pagan themes, notably that of courage for courage's sake, against all the odds, without hope. And on this particular theme -- hope -- Wood misses the mark by zeroing in on exceptional passages as the rule.<br /><br />The fact is that Christian hope is utterly foreign to the people of Middle-Earth. Tolkien's protagonists remain strangely devoid of need for what the author knew to be a cardinal virtue. Hope, far from being an antidote to despair (its role in Christianity), actually leads to despair: \\"We now come to the brink,\\" intones Aragorn, \\"where hope and despair are akin\\". \\"There never was much hope for Frodo,\\" Gandalf tells Pippin, \\"just a fool's hope.\\" In place of hope stand the pagan virtues of courage and cheer: Sam \\"never had any hope in the quest from the beginning, but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope; he had stuck to his master all the way, and he would still stick to him\\". Courage -- without the illusion of hope -- is what keeps despair at bay as Frodo and Sam plod on towards Mount Doom.<br /><br />Even after the Ring's destruction, Frodo says to Sam: \\"It's like things are in the world: hopes fail.\\" Frodo failed to destroy the Ring (having claimed it for himself; Gollum's freak intervention is what destroyed it), and failure is what he had expected all along. \\"It's like things are in the world.\\" This is what the people of Middle-Earth know to be true: that evil can be resisted but not overcome, and that it must be resisted for no other reason than because it is the right thing to do.<br /><br />But Wood has virtually nothing to say about the multitude of passages in which hope is so clearly eschewed by the heroes of Middle-Earth.<br /><br />The book is nonetheless well written, thought-provoking, and offers a formidable challenge to Tom Shippey's magisterial \\"JRR Tolkien: Author of the Century\\".eptional passages as the rule.

The authors shed light on subtle aspects of ancient Middle East culture which go completely over our heads when we read the bible.<br /><br />For instance, in ancient Palestine compliments were enviously aggressive. They implicitly accused a person of rising above others at their expense. Thus, when a man challenges Jesus by calling him a \\"good teacher\\", Jesus must fend off the accusation with a counterquestion: \\"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone?\\" (Mk. 10:17-18/Mt. 19:16-17/Lk. 18:18-19). In Jesus' world, honorable men didn't defend themselves when challenged -- for that would only concede ground to their opponents -- instead, they counterattacked. In the gospels Jesus proves himself an honorable man time and time again. He never answers accusatory questions directly; he is always able to change the terms of a debate and shift its ground. In Mk. 11:27-33/Mt. 21:23-27/Lk. 20:1-8 a group of temple authorities confront Jesus and demand to know by what authority he made his prophetic demonstration in the temple. Jesus responds with a counterquestion and then ends up insulting them by refusing to reveal anything at all. Then, in Mk. 12:13-17/Mt. 22:15-22/Lk. 20:20-26, a group of Herodians and Pharisees try snaring Jesus by getting him to admit having revolutionary sentiments about paying taxes. Jesus deflects their question by having them produce a coin for him, and then, holding it up for all to see, he shames them with a nasty counterquestion and tricks them into identifying themselves as idolaters before concluding with his well-known cryptic saying, \\"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's\\". All of these examples show how honorable first-century Jews debated in public.<br /><br />The authors illumine the values of Galilean peasants as distinct from Judean Pharisees and other temple authorities. Consider the conflict related in Mk. 7:1-25, where a group of Pharisees demand that Jesus explain why his disciples eat with unwashed hands. Jesus, naturally, doesn't deign to explain this. Instead, he counterattacks with insults -- calling the Pharisees hypocrites -- and then escalates the conflict by showing them up with scripture citations, setting his own interpretation of the Torah against theirs. But the authors do provide an explanation: \\"Keeping purity laws was a near impossibility for peasant farmers, who did not have the required water for ritual baths, as well as for fishermen, who came in constant contact with dead fish, dead animals, and the like. It was also very difficult for people who traveled about, such as Jesus and his disciples. The religious tradition of the Galileans had adapted itself in significant measure to the realities of peasant life.\\"<br /><br />The commentary brings to life ancient Mediterranean values as contrasted with ours in the modern West. For instance, discovering identity was not a process of self-discovery like it is with us. Identity was provided by one's peers, not by oneself. When Jesus asks Peter, \\"Who do you say I am?\\", and Peter replies, \\"You are the messiah\\" (Mk. 8:29), most of us today think that Jesus knows who he is and is simply testing his disciples to see if they know. But the authors correctly refute this: \\"Since Jesus rejected his own honor by leaving his family and village and living as an itinerant exorcist-healer, he needs to find out what his status is both among the public and his followers.\\" They provide him with his messianic identity. Only when public support has grown substantially will he finally be comfortable identifying himself as the messiah (as in Mk. 14:61-62). For now, he is terrified of the title, and he \\"sternly orders Peter not to tell anyone about it\\" (Mk. 8:30).<br /><br />Malina and Rohrbaugh have described just about every behavioral cue andcultural script we could think of -- how ancient gossip networks functioned, why all rich people were considered thieves, the nature of patron-client relationships, etc. This book is a priceless tool, and it has already been used as a foundation for more comprehensive treatments of the historical Jesus. Be sure to buy it and the sequel, \\"Social Science Commentary on the Gospel of John\\".<br /><br />This is an updated and improved version of the earlier '92 publication, with material re-arranged for easier reading, and new commentary as well.f -- how ancient gossip networks functioned, why all rich people were considered thieves, the nature of patron-client relationships, etc. This book is a priceless tool, and it has already been used as a foundation for more comprehensive treatments of the historical Jesus.

US	51134799	R3R0FI647JQKBL	0800632141	300656454	The Irony of Galatians: Paul's Letter in First-Century Context	Books	5	59	63	N	Y	The most disciplined study of the rhetoric in Galatians	Mark Nanos argues that Galatians must be understood primarily as a letter of &quot;ironic rebuke&quot;, Paul's knee-jerk reaction to the news that his Gentile converts have begun to accept circumcision, and thus the &quot;whole Torah&quot;, as a complement to their faith in Christ. Furious and exasperated (&quot;like a parent scolding children being influenced by their peers&quot;), he wrote this letter with smoldering sarcasm and vilifying rhetoric -- neither of which portray his converts or those advocating their circumcision (or Paul himself!) very accurately. Nanos calls this &quot;ironic rebuke&quot;, which served the purpose of redirecting the Galatians to his circumcision-free gospel by means of humiliation and shame.<br />Nanos strikes quite a blow in redressing the identity of the circumcision advocates, and he dispenses with some misleading labels: (1) &quot;Judaizers&quot; is a misnomer, since the verb &quot;to Judaize&quot; is intransitive and would thus refer not to Jews who impose the law on Gentiles, but to Gentiles who choose to adopt the Jewish law. (2) &quot;Opponents&quot; is misleading, for it implies that these advocates explicitly opposed Paul's gospel with their &quot;circumcision gospel&quot;, rather than seeking perhaps to complement the former with the latter; it implies that Paul wrote to defend himself, his gospel, and his apostolic authority. But far from defending himself, Paul was making an offensive and preemptive strike, well anticipating that these advocates would (indeed) become his opponents after the letter arrived. (3) &quot;Agitators&quot; or &quot;troublemakers&quot; have no place in an historical discussion, since they are simply drawn from the surface of Paul's rhetoric; he thought they were troublemakers, but they themselves obviously didn't, and many of his converts apparently didn't think so either. (4) &quot;Teachers&quot; has been the fairest label to date, but no evidence suggests this specific vocation. For all these reasons, Nanos cautiously speaks of &quot;influencers&quot; -- local Galatian Jews in charge of administering proselyte conversion (circumcision rites) to Gentiles. These influencers represented minority (Jewish) groups in terms of the larger pagan communities of Galatia, but they represented the majority in terms of Jewish interaction with the Christian coalitions.<br />This naturally denies the traditional view that the influencers themselves were Christian. With powerful and robust exegesis, Nanos shows that Gal. 1:6-7 and 6:12 actually point to non-Christians -- who, furthermore, had no ties to distant Jerusalem. They are made parallel to (but not identical with) the &quot;pseudo brethren&quot; who had invaded the private Christian meeting in Jerusalem (Gal. 2:4), and to the &quot;circumcision faction&quot; who afterwards appeared at Antioch (Gal. 2:12). Just like Peter who capitulated to outsider influence, so now the Galatians were succumbing to social pressure from wider Judaism.<br />So Paul's converts didn't really want to become Jews per se, anymore than they desired returning to pagan practices. These were attractive options (Gal. 5:2-3, 4:8-10) only in so far as they allowed the Galatian Gentiles to &quot;fit in&quot; and escape marginalization from the wider Jewish community (and the much wider pagan community) of which they were a part. Paul cannot stomach these options in any case, for they would undermine precisely what Christ's death on the cross had accomplished for the Gentile race (Gal. 2:21; 3:1; 3:13-14). When he vilifies everyone -- cursing the influencers (Gal. 1:8-9, 3:10) and wishing castration on them (Gal. 5:12), deriding his own converts as &quot;bewitched fools&quot; (Gal. 3:1) -- we learn more about his offensive and exasperated state of mind than the actual character of the parties involved. If Paul could have foreseen the consequences of his rhetoric in the centuries to come, he might have decided to &quot;change his tone&quot; (Gal.4:20) after all.<br />Mark Nanos is one of those rare biblical scholars capable of being innovative while maintaining a focused respect for every chapter and verse of the text. One reviewer has already called this book &quot;the most thorough and innovative investigation of Galatians since Betz's commentary in '79&quot;, and I heartily concur. In fact, on many points, Nanos has superseded Philip Esler, whose own compelling work on Galatians presents a sharply sectarian and less &quot;Jewish-friendly&quot; Paul. Both represent the best that scholarship currently has to offer.4:20) after all.<br />Mark Nanos is one of those rare biblical scholars capable of being innovative while maintaining a focused respect for every chapter and verse of the text.

It promises to &quot;unlock New Testament culture&quot; and hints at some good applications of the honor-shame, patron-client, kinship, purity, and challenge-riposte models. But it doesn't take long before the reader smells a bad stink. While thoroughly educated in the social sciences, David deSilva uses his knowledge selectively by pressing it into the service of Protestant evangelism.<br />For instance, the author draws a parallel between the persecutions of the early Christians and the &quot;subtle pressures being exerted on [us modern evangelicals] to soften our commitment to 'one faith, one Lord' in the name of toleration, pluralism, and multiculturalism&quot; (p 84). The parallel is ridiculous, of course, but deSilva goes on bemoaning the evils of modern liberalism as if they're terribly relevant to the subject at hand: &quot;Desire to make room at the table for everyone's beliefs has made it very unpopular to claim to have the Truth and try to win others from their traditions to one's own... Religion is declared out of place in public spaces like businesses and schools...&quot; This sort of rhetoric crops up throughout the book, and it's enough to hurt one's stomach.<br />In discussing the phenomenon of challenge-riposte, deSilva claims that the Christian movement sought to cultivate a specific Christian riposte over and against much of Judaism and the Greco-Roman world. &quot;Followers of Jesus overcame challenges to honor not through using the same currency of insult or violence that the outside world threw at them, but rather they met hostility with generosity, violence with courageous refusal, curse with blessing from God's inexhaustible resources of goodness and kindness.&quot; (p 71) This is only half correct. While it's true that the early Christian movement was characterized by non-violence and (depending on the situation) generosity and kindness, that's certainly not the whole picture. Jesus himself was extremely foul-mouthed when engaged in challenge-riposte. &quot;Brood of vipers&quot; (snake bastards), &quot;hypocrites&quot;, &quot;blind guides&quot;, &quot;whitewashed tombs&quot; (beautiful on the outside, full of bones and decay on the inside), and &quot;offspring of the devil&quot; were among his favorite insults -- nasty name-calling which the author treats rather evasively (pp 62, 163, 282). Likewise, the apostle Paul enjoyed heaping curses and diatribes on friend and foe alike -- on the &quot;circumcision dogs&quot; at Philippi, on his friend Peter the &quot;hypocrite&quot;, on his &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;bewitched&quot; converts in Galatia (and on those &quot;accursed&quot; people who were influencing his poor converts), and many more. DeSilva hardly does justice to early Christianity as part of an agonistic milieu.<br />Save for a brief allusion to The Testament of Joseph (p 171), deSilva devotes no attention to the phenomenon of honorable lying -- which is hardly surprising, since an evangelical would have no use for such a concept. But in collectivist cultures like the ancient Mediterranean, lying could be very honorable. Outsiders and enemies had no right to the truth, which is why, for instance, Jesus lied to his brothers who &quot;did not believe in him&quot; (Jn 7:5), saying that he would not go to the festival in Jerusalem (Jn 7:8), yet doing exactly that as soon as they walked away (Jn 7:10). By the same token, insiders and friends preferred (and expected) to be lied to, if the truth would otherwise have offended their feelings. Lying in order to (a) deceive or degrade outsiders, or (b) preserve harmony among insiders, were both equally honorable. But deSilva has nothing to say about this phenomenon. For a book that promisesto &quot;unlock honor-shame culture&quot;, this omission is a serious shortcoming.<br />One strong point in deSilva's favor is that he cites a lot of primary source material, which is helpful. And he does make some good points, here and there. The book is definitely worth reading, despite being marred by an evangelical agenda. But those who are really interested in &quot;unlocking the culture of the New Testament&quot; should stick to material written by deSilva's betters -- Bruce Malina, Richard Rohrbaugh, Jerome Neyrey, and other members of the Context Group.to &quot;unlock honor-shame culture&quot;, this omission is a serious shortcoming.<br />One strong point in deSilva's favor is that he cites a lot of primary source material, which is helpful.

He writes for the commonweal as much as the academy, and advocates for the everyman without dumbing down.<br /><br />He begins by examining three contemporary writers: Tom Wolfe, Seamus Heaney, and Toni Morrison. With merciless severity, he skewers Wolfe as a cartoonish fool lacking any concern for the subtleties of literary fineness. In fact, the first chapter of this book may well have been entitled \\"Why 'A Man in Full' is Overrated, Sophomoric Trash\\". I particularly like the observation that Wolfe's fiction engages one's attention in the same way that cocaine arouses pleasure, \\"using up the brain's natural chemicals to such an extent, that, without the drug, the addict is left like the knight in Keats' poem, 'all haggard and woe-begone'\\"; and that it's impossible to quote from Wolfe \\"without feeling that he used plastic and neon for his sentences instead of more expensive materials\\".<br /><br />Arbery then examines the poetry of Seamus Heaney and the fiction of Toni Morrison by way of contrast to someone like Wolfe, showing why they stand as fine examples of modern literature. He disagrees, for instance, with the critics of Toni Morrison, arguing that her literary honors owe not so much from favor with modern liberalism (unlike those of Alice Walker, with whom Morrison is \\"often unjustly tied\\"), but rather because of the inherent achievements of her fiction. \\"Impatient with 'race' as a supposed ontology, powerfully intelligent, Morrison does not promote the 'black experience' so much as she questions its meaning and locates it thoughtfully within an American literary tradition that prominently includes Hawthorne, Melville, Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor... Morrison finds universal qualities with her subjects, because she chooses, not Us-vs-Them, but Us-vs-Us situations\\". Instead of angrily demanding social justice, Morrison engages the social drama of modernity and \\"tests dominant ideas by showing what happens when they unfold in plausible human action\\". In this sense, Morrison achieves literarily what a writer like Walker cannot.<br /><br />After an examination of Shakespeare's Othello, Arbery concludes that the play \\"raises to the level of tragedy questions of identity that have become more acute in the centuries since Shakespeare\\", while at the same time cautioning against reading the play simply in terms of American issues of race and mixed marriages. One senses that Shakespeare had nothing against mixed marriages per se, though his advice was to beware, as a universal ethic of love proves (time after time) to be at odds with the necessities of politics.<br /><br />In an interesting chapter on \\"the intelligence of feeling\\", Arbery takes issue with the literary critics who tend to drive a wedge between the analysis of art and the feeling it engenders. It won't work, says Arbery. One cannot paraphrase parts of a novel or poem and have it mean the same thing as what is experienced in the moving continuum of the entire writing. Feelings help us understand what the writer \\"wants to say\\" in a way that conceptual recognition alone cannot reach. Arbery cites neurologist Antonio Damasio in arguing that reason, paradoxically, is rooted in emotions and feelings -- and furthermore that, \\"unseemly as it might be to trace poetry down into neurochemical substances, what goes on in the experience of literature has to be considered as an extremely complex physical process.\\"<br /><br />The best chapter is the last one entitled \\"The Sacrifice of Achilles\\". Arbery rightly recognizes The Iliad as the measure of every form of literature in the Western canon, and he proceeds with a lengthy and visceral analysis that leaves the reader tongue-tied. I'll say no more, save that if you're unfortunate to have never read Homer (or if you've only given him a superficial reading pursuant to the demands of high-school), you'll be left with a craving to plunge into the savage world of Achilles, live his glory, and experience alongside him that ultimate humiliation and loss called mortality.<br /><br />This book is challenging and gratifying at once, and a serious achievement which should be read by anyone interested in the enduring value of modern and ancient literature. Give it a try, it may change you.omer (or if you've only given him a superficial reading pursuant to the demands of high-school), you'll be left with a craving to plunge into the savage world of Achilles, live his glory, and experience alongside him that ultimate humiliation and loss called mortality.<br /><br />This book is challenging and gratifying at once, and a serious achievement which should be read by anyone interested in the enduring value of modern and ancient literature.

He refutes the artificial distinction between sappientalism and apocalypticism, showing how the two went hand-in-hand (albeit in varying degrees) throughout the 2nd-Temple period. Then, comparing the letter to the synoptic gospels, he notes features of comparison between James and Jesus: (a) the focus on the Torah's concern for ethics and the heart as the source of words and actions (Jas. 1:22-25; 3:6-8; 4:11-12); (b) a standard of community living in which solidarity with the poor replaces hierarchy and status (1:9-10; 2:1-7); (c) God's apocalyptic judgment as the overriding motivation for righteous living, with punishment especially threatening the wealthy (5:1-5) -- but no less a reality for everyone else (2:13; 3:1, 4:12, 5:8-9), as is the prospect of reward (1:12, 3:18); (d) the concern for \\"Israel as a light to the nations\\", whereby Jesus brought the Kingdom to Israel, and now James addresses Jewish communities in the diaspora (1:1) as the nucleus of the ongoing messianic movement which must serve as a beacon to the Gentiles.<br /><br />The author shows that James' doctrine of works doesn't exactly correct Paul's doctrine of faith. Paul was hostile to specific kinds of works -- circumcision, food laws, holy days, or any requirements which were a stumbling block to Gentiles; James was enthusiastic for good deeds in general. His discourse in 2:14-26 is general paraenesis, a reminder that good deeds must naturally accompany one's faith, something with which Paul naturally agreed. Paul and James simply mean different things by the term \\"works\\". Likewise, they offer different, but not necessarily contradictory, exegetical interpretations of Abraham (Gal. 3:6-9/Rom. 4:1-17; Jas. 2:21-24).<br /><br />I agree with this particular point, but not with the implication that Paul usually agreed with James or got along with him. In his own review Mark Goodacre notes that \\"Bauckham comes to us as a kind of modern-day Luke, for whom all in the early church is harmony, where disagreements are only over degrees of emphasis\\". Quite right, and that paints an equally misleading picture. Paul and James were serious rivals. Paul thought the law was finished, and that good deeds could follow only by another route -- the spirit; James thought the law remained in force. Paul believed in indiscriminate table-fellowship between Jew and Gentile; James did not. Etc.<br /><br />Quibbles aside, this is the best commentary on James and should be mandatory reading for specialists of James and Paul alike. Bauckham no doubt has Martin Luther shrieking in his grave. Luther's contempt for James as an \\"epistle of straw\\" is well-known and still shared by many today. But instead of taking the letter as an inferior corrective to Pauline doctrine, we are compelled to come to terms with it on its own right -- as an encyclical of subversive wisdom written for Jewish communities in the diaspora.ul usually agreed with James or got along with him.

True enough, I guess. On the back cover, a rather different kind of reviewer proclaims that this book should be in every hotel room (!). This book has about as much place in a hotel room as a Gideon Bible. One may ask if it has any redeeming value at all.<br />From a librarian's point of view: The book-selection committee on which I sit was divided in opinion. Some thought the book should be thrown away. Others maintained that it should be catalogued on grounds of a library's basic \\"intellectual freedom\\" stance, and also because of the book's possible research value on fringe and taboo subjects. In fact, I was probably the strongest advocate for cataloguing the book. No matter how unappetizing a topic, that -- in and of itself -- is no justification for library censorship. From a personal point of view: While it's raw no matter how you look at it, the subject matter could have been documented more professionally. Graphic material like this can be presented without making readers feel like the editor is laughing at them in disdain, banging them on the heads with shock value, and encouraging them (however obliquely) to identify with such ghastly behavior. One could say that this book doesn't just contain inflammatory material; it goes out of its way to present it inflammatorily.<br />To date, thirty libraries have acquired or made records for this book (twenty-nine in America, one in Britain). Sixty-nine libraries (God, why that number?) own the first volume published back in '91. As a book-buyer, I suppose I could recommend this for library collections where a strong interest in sordid and taboo subjects -- or a frequent enough demand for sources on these -- warrants purchase. As one marginally interested in taboo topics myself, I would allow that it's worth a glance. Otherwise pass.for sources on these -- warrants purchase.

I can't remember the last time a work of Jewish-Christian dialogue seized my mind, challenged me, and opened up new avenues to understanding. It's a series of essays penned by Jewish scholars, each of which is followed by a pair of response-essays, one by another Jewish specialist, the other by a Christian. Topics include the law and ethics, salvation history and covenantal pluralism, liturgy and worship, suffering and martyrdom, incarnation theology, and redemption -- all explicated in Jewish and Christian terms, but with a focus on Jewish origins.<br />All contributors (thirty-two, by my count) steer clear of the common errors which poison religious dialogue: triumphalism, proselytization, syncretism, relativism. (1) Triumphalists believe that no commonalities can be found between the two religions, Jews claiming that Christianity is a deviant form of its parent faith, Christians that Judaism was only a precursor to (and is now superseded by) its successor faith. The authors affirm many commonalities between the two religions, and that denying them is as much a distortion of one as the other. (2) Proselytizers use Jewish-Christian dialogue as a venue by which to persuade the other side to \\"convert\\". The authors, while allowing that either side might naturally wish for the conversion of others, do not approve of using dialogue to realize this hope. (3) Syncretists attempt to construct a new religious reality out of various elements of Judaism and Christianity. The authors reject this as idolatrous and trivializing. (4) Relativists deny that some things are true everywhere for everyone. The authors, while recognizing commonalities between the two religions, also know that the ultimate truth claims of Judaism and Christianity are different and thus mutually exclusive.<br />The dynamic interactions throughout this book show that authentic Jewish-Christian dialogue can succeed without both sides offending the other and (equally important) without both sides becoming one. As an orthodox Jewish theologian puts it, \\"True dialogue is dialogue that respects difference and is animated by it.\\" This is essential reading material for any who are actively involved in Jewish-Christian relations, or for any who have an abiding interest in the Jewish origins of Christianity.important) without both sides becoming one.

Van Voorst has assembled all the extracanonical evidence one could ask for, and he analyzes their value in studying the historical Jesus. He lays out the Agrapha, Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, Infancy Gospels, \\"Secret Mark\\", and much more. He considers the hypothetical sources used by New Testament authors -- Q, Signs Gospel, M, and L. He takes you on a tour through the classical writings of Thallos, Pliny the Younger, Seutonius, Tacitus, Mara bar Serapion, Lucian of Samosata, and Celsus (which portray Jesus as an overall troublemaker), and then the Jewish writings of Josephus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Rabbinic tradition (which yield, or mask, a magician and deceiver). However much you agree or disagree with the author's conclusions, this is an invaluable resource which \\"gathers together disparate texts that are otherwise difficult to find in one place\\" (noted by John Meier).<br /><br />But the author's conclusions are in fact sound, and they serve as a corrective to the theories of those who have been thriving on extra-canonical evidence at the expense of the New Testament. To be sure, there is value in these sources, but that value is fairly limited. Taken in conjunction with John Meier's \\"Marginal Jew\\" (vol I) and Donald Akenson's \\"Saint Saul\\", the trilogy refutes any reconstruction of Jesus which relies heavily on apocryphal testimony.	2000-12-28

But he goes beyond this, claiming that Paul is actually our best source for understanding the historical Jesus. This is news, especially coming from a secular liberal who might be inclined to loathe and distrust Paul to begin with. But Akenson enjoins academics to accept the obvious: \\"Paul taught the history of the earthly Jesus to the churches he founded, and in writing his letters he took for granted that they had assimilated the basic facts, miracle-stories, and sayings. . . Paul actually tells us a lot about the historical Jesus, but he does so almost unintentionally.\\"<br /><br />Akenson minces no words with the academics who thrive on 2nd-century documents (Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter), hypothetical documents (Signs Gospel, Q), and an obvious forgery (Secret Mark) -- and who likewise have made a pseudo-science of \\"downward-dating\\" these documents so that they antedate 70 AD. Instead of dissecting Q, scholars would do well to consider that annoying apostle who preceded all of the above.<br /><br />According to the author, Paul believed the following about the historical Jesus: (1) He never declared himself to be the messiah, and he did nothing in his lifetime which certified his messiahship. The resurrection did that. (2) His transformation into the Christ (the resurrection) was a cosmic and not a physical event. There never was a physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus, for \\"flesh and blood could not inherit the Kingdom of God\\" (I Cor. 15:50). (3) The only valid way of understanding his life on earth is to see him as the Son of God, but in a way incompatible with later \\"virgin birth\\" theology.<br /><br />Admittedly, some of the author's arguments are hard to swallow. His understanding (of Paul's understanding) of the resurrection is only half correct, and it's curious that he doesn't engage Tom Wright, who has written much on the issue. He also overreacts against the criterion of multiple attestation: \\"In the entire New Testament there is no independent confirmation of anything. The New Testament is a single source, and by definition a single source cannot produce multiple attestations of anything.\\" These statements are howlers. Akenson does offer a sobering reappraisal of some methodologies used by the \\"flaming liberal wing\\" of Jesus-questors, but he could stand a few lessons himself.<br /><br />Donald Akenson is an engaging writer, simply incapable of writing a dull sentence. He can make you laugh, he can make you angry, but hopefully, above all, he'll make you think and reconsider a lot of the nonsense being touted these days about Jesus. Hopefully, too, he'll get you interested in that guy who went around Asia Minor and Greece preaching the real historical Jesus.of multiple attestation: \\"In the entire New Testament there is no independent confirmation of anything.

US	51134799	R2ELNIGPS32DJT	0415110378	117098545	Galatians (New Testament Readings)	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	The most important exegetical work on Galatians	Philip Esler presents a sharply sectarian Paul who was offensive not only to mainstream Judaism but his own colleagues as well. He maintains, moreover, that Christianity was sectarian from the get-go, even before Paul's conversion. The fact that Paul had zealously persecuted the church in its earliest years (Gal. 1:13-14; Philip. 3:6) and had \\"preached circumcision\\" during this period (Gal. 5:11) indicates that the movement had already included Gentiles who were involved in a blasphemous practice for which the remedy was circumcision. That practice, according to Esler, was eucharist table-fellowship (I Cor. 10:16-17, 11:23-26), whereby Jews and uncircumcised Gentiles shared bread and wine from the same vessels, risking serious pollution and idolatry.<br /><br />This issue lay at the heart of Paul's conflict with the Jerusalem apostles (Gal. 2:1-10), the following incident at Antioch (Gal. 2:11-14), and the subsequent controversy in Galatia (Gal. 3:1-5, 5:2-6). Paul, like many of the Christians he once persecuted, believed that Gentiles did not need to submit to proselyte conversion in order to engage with Jews in indiscriminate (eucharist) table-fellowship. James, Peter, and John initially agreed to this (Gal. 2:7-9), despite conservative hard-liners in the Christian movement (Gal. 2:4) who fought such blasphemy tooth and nail. Paul's victory over these hard-liners left them steaming with the desire for revenge, and as soon as he and Peter left for Antioch, they put pressure on James to revoke the decision. Esler thinks they were successful, since Peter stopped eating with Gentiles as soon as \\"the circumcision faction\\" (Gal. 2:12) arrived at Antioch to break the sore news.<br /><br />Now confronting a new crisis, Paul recounts these earlier conflicts and proceeds to mount a full-fledged attack on the Jewish law in order to keep rival Christian missionaries at bay and away from influencing his Gentile converts in Galatia. He derides the Torah as a \\"curse\\" leading to transgression and sin, and as something which is diametrically opposed to faith and the Spirit. Against scholars like James Dunn, Esler contends that Gal. 5:14 (\\"the whole law is summed up in the commandment `love your neighbor as yourself'\\") in no way implies that an ethical part of the law remains relevant for Christian living, but rather that Christians have access \\"to the best which the law could provide\\" by a completely different route -- the Spirit. And the reference to \\"the law of Christ\\" in Gal. 6:2 represents the apostle's \\"most daring inversion and final nail hammered into his argument that the law of Moses is now entirely irrelevant\\".<br /><br />This commentary explains Paul's most hostile letter using models of Mediterranean social values and sectarian rhetoric, and it's probably the best available book on Galatians. But Esler's arguments will be fiercely disputed by Mark Nanos, whose equally compelling work on Galatians presents a non-sectarian and \\"Jewish-friendly\\" Paul, who got along well with the other apostles -- and who did not, in fact, oppose the law!

Taylor refutes (once and for all, hopefully) theories which associate John with the Essenes. He lived in the wilderness himself, but he sent people home after baptizing them; he was an ascetic, but the particular foods he rejected were accepted by the Essenes;  he wore camel hair sackcloth, the Essenes wore white garments; he lived in the lower Jordan, they lived on the western shores of the Dead Sea. About the Pharisees, Taylor concludes that they were probably not overly hostile to John. They may have disagreed with the belief that a purification rite like baptism needed prior repentance, but they certainly wouldn't have been offended by a prophet who was turning sinners back to righteousness. Her chapter dealing with John's execution is very helpful, probably the best in the book. She notes that unlike other wilderness prophets of the first century (whose followers were also rounded up and slaughtered), John did not gather people in order to march on Jerusalem. He believed the kingdom was coming -- and thus that the powers-that-be would soon \\"get their due\\" -- but his methods were less seditious, as he sent people home to await the kingdom after they were baptized. But Antipas no doubt worried that the Baptist movement could flower into the more popular form of prophetic revolution, and so John's criticism of his marriage was the excuse he needed to do away with him. Finally, Taylor explores the relationship between John and Jesus, suggesting that Jesus counted himself among the followers of the Baptist who needed repentance, and who upon immersion had a prophetic calling, went out into the  wilderness himself...and then began his own movement, in which he continued the practice of baptizing.	2000-08-31

The two most secure pieces of Gospel evidence are that  (1) Jesus proclaimed and taught about the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; and  (2) he was a successful exorcist-healer. Deny either of those, and you may  as well trash the Gospels. Davies recognizes this quite clearly and has  attempted to come to terms with it. Unfortunately, he misassimilates a lot  of fine knowledge.<br />Davies uses contemporary psychology to account for the  successful nature of Jesus' healings and exorcisms: Blindness, deafness,  loss of speech, and paralysis were &quot;conversion disorders&quot;  occurring as interiorizations of guilt and despair, and, likewise,  demon-possessions were &quot;multiple personality disorders&quot; occurring  as coping mechanisms for abusive family relationships. He then argues that  the function of Jesus' parables was to heal such disorders (!). He sees the  Kingdom of God as a therapeutical state of religious trance, effected by  the parables. A wild and far-fetched claim like this calls to mind some of  the liberal questers of the nineteenth century. To be sure, Jesus spoke in  parables, and he healed people, but one had little to do with the other.  There is also a problem with Davies' misuse of modern Western psychology,  applying it to the ancient Middle-East. Abusive family relationships would  not have caused many multiple personality disorders in antiquity, where all  people -- men, women, and children alike -- were conditioned to defend  their honor constantly and forcefully against abuse and attacks. Ancient  Jews were not &quot;psychologically damaged&quot; by the same kinds of  things we are today. There is nothing wrong with using psychology to  explain demon-possession, but Davies doesn't have the correct psychological  model.<br />On the whole, Davies has pushed a lot of Gospel data through a  single (and not entirely correct) interpretive sieve. Jesus was indeed a  dynamic and successful exorcist-healer. But he was also a teacher. He told  parables to empower people living under oppression, not heal them of  illnesses. None of his teachings in any way diminish his role as a healer.s indeed a  dynamic and successful exorcist-healer. But he was also a teacher.

The real strength of Nanos' book lies in the exposition of Rom. 14:1-15:6, where Paul discusses the \\"weak in faith\\" and the \\"strong in faith\\" in Rome. The author refutes the traditional view that the weak  in faith were Christian Jews, arguing that they were almost certainly  non-Christian Jews. These Jews were weak in faith because they refused to  accept Jesus as Israel's true messiah, not because they lived by the works  of the law. On the contrary, those who observed purity laws, fasting,  sabbath -- or any Jewish works -- were to \\"be fully convinced in their own  minds what is right\\" (Rom. 14:5). They were to continue \\"observing the  sabbath in honor of the Lord\\" (Rom. 14:6a) as well as \\"abstaining from meat  in honor of the Lord\\" (Rom. 14:6b). Paul didn't believe that the Jews in  Rome were \\"weak in practice\\" or \\"weak in opinions\\". He thought they were  \\"weak in faith\\", refusing to believe that the messiah had come and  initiated the eschatological age.<br /><br />Nanos handles the implications of the  Apostolic Decree (Acts 15:20) very well. He allows that while Paul may have disagreed with  James' compromise in theory (\\"nothing is unclean in itself\\" (Rom. 14:14a)), he agreed with apostolic wisdom in practice (\\"food  is unclean, however, for those who think it is unclean\\" (Rom. 14:14b)).  Gentiles, while in the company of Jews, must abide by the minimal purity  standards of the Apostolic Decree. \\"If your brother is being injured by  what you eat, you are no longer walking in love\\" (Rom. 14:15). Paul  exhorted the Gentiles in Rome to observe any purity regulations that would  otherwise have offended their Jewish associates. \\"It is good not to eat  meat, or drink wine, or do anything that causes your brother to stumble\\"  (Rom. 14:21). Paul wanted the strong in faith to accommodate the weak in  faith and \\"not please themselves\\" (Rom. 15:1), so that, hopefully, soon,  the Jews would embrace Christianity and both groups could worship as \\"one  voice\\" (Rom. 15:5-6).<br /><br />So Gentiles may be theoretically free from the works of the law, but that freedom must always be examined in light of the company one is in. Israel's place is preeminent (Rom. 11:17-18), and Gentile arrogance will result in  being cut off from the church and salvation altogether (Rom. 11:20b-21). Jewish heritage demands respect. This book could go a long way in promoting honest Jewish-Christian dialogue. While not a comprehensive  commentary of Romans, its focus on key passages clears up serious confusion and provides a solid foundation for understanding Paul's most famous letter.entiles may be theoretically free from the works of the law, but that freedom must always be examined in light of the company one is in.

(They note parallel examples of anti-societies, such as reform-school  students in Poland, members of the underworld in India, and vagabonds in  Elizabethan England.)  As such, it had developed its own  &quot;anti-language&quot;, that is, a resistance language used to maintain  its highly sectarian religious reality.  This accounts for many of the  strange expressions found in the gospel.  For instance, the Christians of  this community referred to all outsiders as people of &quot;this  world&quot;.  They believed that all members of wider society -- especially  &quot;the Jews&quot; -- lay outside the scope of redemption and were  completely beyond the pale.  Like all anti-societies, they overlexicalized  their language, which basically means that they used redundant euphemisms.  Thus, &quot;believing into Jesus&quot;, &quot;abiding in him&quot;,  &quot;loving him&quot;, &quot;keeping his word&quot;, &quot;receiving  him&quot;, &quot;having him&quot;, and &quot;seeing him&quot; all meant the  same thing.  Likewise, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;light&quot;,  &quot;door&quot;, life&quot;, &quot;way&quot;, and &quot;vine&quot; were  all redundant metaphors for Jesus himself.  This anti-language served to  maintain inner solidarity in the face of pressures (or perhaps even  persecutions) from wider society.  Unlike the religious language found in  the Synoptic Gospels or Paul's letters, John's language would have been  meaningless in the context of wider Judeo-Christian society (&quot;this  world&quot;).<br />Understanding this social background is crucial for  interpreting the gospel as a whole and controversial passages in  particular.........................	2000-05-22

Much like the 20th-century Paulo Freire, Jesus was teaching people that life under exploitation and oppression wasn't inevitable; and the parables explored how the Jewish peasantry might respond to distressing situations in order to break violence and poverty.<br /><br />The stories did this by depicting everyday life (to which peasants had long since resigned themselves) only to introduce shocking departures from it. For instance, an elite goes to the marketplace to exploit groups of day-laborers, but one of the day-laborers challenges him (Mt.20:1-15). Lazarus, a destitute man, ends up in Abraham's bosom, while a rich man burns in Hades, destined for an even worse place (Lk.16:19-31). A retainer buries his master's money instead of investing it to make more, and then he blows the whistle on the tyrant (Mt.25:14-28/Lk.19:12-24). A widow is treated unjustly in court, but she relentlessly and publicly refuses to accept the judge's verdict (Lk.18:2-5). A messianic king forgives a colossal debt, but this messiah turns out to be not such a benign sweetie-pie after all (Mt.18:23-34). Like Friere, Jesus empowered people by allowing them to understand the world on their own terms for a change. And just as Freire was arrested and exiled, the Galilean was arrested and crucified.<br /><br />Talk about thinking outside the box. If Herzog is right, most commentators have been clueless for ages. The masters and landowners in these stories aren't ciphers for God. Just the opposite: they're exactly as portrayed. This book (and its sequel, \\"Jesus, Justice, and the Reign of God\\") provides an especially insightful window onto the historical Jesus, whose concerns were forever with those at the bottom of the social heap.	2000-01-18

He declares at the outset: &quot;There was never, except in polemic and fiction, 'The Inquisition', a single all-powerful, horrific  tribunal, whose agents worked everywhere to thwart religious truth,  intellectual freedom, and political liberty. That is 'The Inquisition' of  folklore, martyrology artwork, and post-Enlightenment fiction.&quot; He  traces the development of Roman Catholic inquisitions from their inception  in the 900's, &quot;pre-inquisitions&quot; involving popular lynchings,  secular judgments, and other forms of harsh coercion by Europe's laity, in  contrast with the patient and persuasive methods used by the clergy. By the  late 1100's and early 1200's, however, patience and persuasion ran their  course, and inquisitions were officially chartered. The medieval  inquisitions of the 1200's-1500's proceeded as formal but secret trials,  guided by a doctrine of torture (outlined and explained at some length by  the author), and they operated throughout Europe according to discretion,  based on local needs. With the advent of the Protestant Reformation, they  faded from history, and the Roman Inquisition (1542-1908) was chartered in  their place to combat the new &quot;heresy&quot; tearing apart Europe, then  later to focus almost exclusively on internal ecclesiastical discipline. It  was the Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834), originating as a national and  public institution to deal with problems unique to Spain, whose character  -- especially when the nation became the great world power in the 1500's --  shaped, dramatically, subsequent perceptions of &quot;The  Inquisition&quot;, the (supposed) singular, malevolent Catholic tribunal  inflicting tyranny and intellectual oppression everywhere. Unlike the  medieval inquisitions, the Spanish Inquisition performed its function with  aggressive popular support and governmental backing, and it focused on  preserving orthodoxy in a national and xenophobic manner, publicly  punishing Jews as &quot;heretics&quot;. The procedures and personnel of the  Spanish Inquisition were soon transformed by polemic, artwork, and fiction  into the myth of &quot;The Inquisition&quot;, a process begun in the 1500's  and continuing to the present day (as evidenced in some of the misguided  customer reviews below).<br />This book is an instructive lesson not only in  inquisition history, but in the way myth and history often compete with one  another. It is not, by any means, a &quot;whitewash&quot; of the  phenomenon, nor is it apologetic revisionism. It is an honest and accurate  analysis of a religious-legal procedure which developed, changed, did good  and bad, over the course of many centuries.orthodoxy in a national and xenophobic manner, publicly  punishing Jews as &quot;heretics&quot;.

Jesus, she says, wasn't killed for black magic, Torah-disputes, parables, nor even his outrageous demonstration in the temple. As offensive as these were to many, they wouldn't have resulted in crucifixion. Authorities knew that Jesus was essentially a harmless nuisance: Antipas left him alone, because (unlike the Baptist and other prophets) he didn't convene mass rallies in the desert; and Pilate didn't move against him on account of the triumphal entry, because he'd been long aware that Jesus really posed no threat to Roman power (John's gospel correctly indicates he'd been in Jerusalem before). The demonstration in the temple, moreover, would have hardly been noticed by anyone during a festival. But during his last trip to Jerusalem, in the days between his triumphal entry and last supper, Jesus fueled alarming amounts of messianic enthusiasm. The author suggests that Jesus stepped up the apocalypse's timetable from \\"soon\\" to \\"now\\" -- proclaiming that this passover would be the last before the kingdom arrived -- with increased amounts of crowds and pilgrims acclaiming him the messianic liberator. Pilate finally acted against Jesus to set an example for the masses and prevent riots.<br /><br />In many ways this book owes to E.P. Sanders' reconstruction of Jesus the eschatological prophet obedient to Torah, but while for Sanders Jesus was killed for acting against the temple, Fredriksen believes he was executed because Caiaphas was nervous about Pilate's itchy trigger-finger when dealing with popular prophets. This is a sound contribution to historical-Jesus studies and should be read by anyone remotely interested in the field.	1999-12-23

This landmark classic demonstrates the cliche of \\"the painting telling more about the painter than the subject being painted\\". People use the gospels as a mirror for their own beliefs and reconstruct Jesus accordingly in their self-images. Schweitzer's Jesus, by contrast, stands on a foreign landscape of apocalyptic fanaticism -- a deluded prophet who thought he was God's instrument sent to announce the end of history; burning with apocalyptic zeal, marching to Jerusalem, confident he could force God's hand and usher in the kingdom through a voluntary death. But it didn't happen. Jesus was crushed by the system he defied, and the drama ended on the cross.<br /><br />Even if Schweitzer's portrait of Jesus is a bit extreme, he got the basics right -- Jesus the eschatological prophet -- and closed the curtains on the liberal quest for Jesus. He was a prophet himself, for we have another liberal quest today in the work of the Jesus Seminar. Instead of Jesus the liberal Protestant, the Seminar gives us Jesus the liberal humanist, disguised as a non-apocalyptic sage. For more up-to-date works which follow Schweitzer's apocalyptic prophet, see E.P. Sanders' \\"The Historical Figure of Jesus\\", Paula Fredriksen's \\"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\\", and Dale Allison's \\"Jesus of Nazareth: Millenarian Prophet\\". Allison's book, in particular, is worth its weight in gold.	1999-12-08

Building on his 1994 publication, \\"Parables as Subversive Speech\\", William Herzog gives us one of the best comprehensive treatments of the historical Jesus. The author has worked closely with a group of scholars known as the Context Group, who for the past two decades have been using social science models to help understand the bible. Because the Context Group has been interested in a genuine usable context -- rather than wild and sensationalist claims -- its scholars have not received publicity and notoriety like many of those on the Jesus Seminar. And this book is a sorely needed remedy to the Seminar's domestication of Jesus as a laid-back cynic-sage who tossed around playful aphorisms and parables, unmindful of politics and having little to do with Judaism. Herzog paints Jesus as a fiercely political prophet who threw himself head-first into economic and religious turmoil.<br /><br />As such, the Galilean was a prophet of justice rooted in Jewish tradition, devoted to the covenant standards of ancient Israel. He used the Torah to disclose the will of God, and to warn those who abused it as an instrument of oppression. He didn't so much oppose the Torah as he did certain interpretations of it, taking its debt codes as the starting point rather than the purity codes. (Debt codes having to do with the exodus out of slavery and bondage, and the gift of the promised land as a blessing from which all were to benefit; purity codes, meanwhile, segregating clean from unclean and reinforcing boundaries.) Priests and Pharisees viewed debt codes in terms of purity codes, poverty being the result of uncleanliness and sin. But peasants couldn't afford to be diligent about purity and pay the tithes and sacrifices required for temple offerings -- taxed to death as they were already by the Romans and/or Herodians. So Jesus viewed purity codes in terms of debt codes, poverty being the result of aristocratic greed, which had over the centuries transformed the promised land into an advanced agrarian society from which a tiny upper class reaped benefits at the expense of everyone else. Purity codes only widened that gulf between the rich and poor.<br /><br />Herzog provides essential and exhaustive background to the world of Jesus, in particular the worsening conditions in Galilee (building on works of Sean Freyne, S.B. Honig, and Richard Horsley). Through exorcisms, healings, teachings, and parables, Jesus taught the peasantry to see their distressing situation not as God's will, but as the consequence of the violation of God's covenant. He opposed the payment of tribute to Caesar (no better commentary exists for the infamous \\"Render to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's\\") and indicted the Jewish priesthood for its collaboration with Roman and Herodian rulers. During his last days in Jerusalem, he enacted a symbolic destruction of the temple in a fit of prophetic rage, denouncing the priestly establishment for having become a den of thieves and robbers who squeezed the Jewish people to the limit, leaving them malnourished, unclean, and in perpetual debt. Finally, in contrast to the minimalist positions of those like John Dominic Crossan, Herzog views the passion narratives as largely historical and provides an excellent analysis of those narratives.<br /><br />This is one of the most accomplished works on the historical Jesus. It's weak on the point of eschatology, since it denies Jesus his apocalyptic due (Schweitzer's legacy seems to stick in everyone's craw). But for the most part, Herzog biffs the nail on the head. His Jesus is devoid of sentimentality and a true product of honor-shame: a macho guy who burned his rivals by refusing to answer questions directly, escalating conflict with counterquestions, counteraccusations, rhetoric, scriptural one-upsmanship, and insults.

This atlas offers 150+ pages of beautiful maps punctuated with painstaking detail --  geographical features, historical dates, battle sites, travel routes,  castles & fortresses, monasteries & holy sites, cities & towns -- all set against the backdrop of splendid color plating. The expeditions to the holy lands (1095-1291 CE) are charted in great detail, as well as the campaigns in Spain and the Baltic region. This provides for a collective 500-year time period (1000's-1500's CE) of the crusades. One's knowledge of medieval Christendom and the Islamic world will be strengthened beyond measure by this handsome tome. It reflects highly specialized research and is a tool for students and professors alike. Definitely worth $40.00<br /><br />Riley-Smith is today's top crusades historian whose works have rivaled even Runciman's three-volume classic. Four textual sections in the atlas briefly present Riley-Smith's newer theories which depict crusaders as zealous pilgrims (not colonial boors), motivated by ideology (more than land and booty). There were few rewards to be won in Palestine, people knew it, and the costs involved in embarking on a crusade were astronomical. We certainly don't accept the crusading world-view today, but we are obligated to understand it and describe it as accurately as we can. Riley-Smith has done so, and this atlas stands as a monument to his scholarship of the past three decades.	1999-06-29

Leif Erickson beat him by five centuries, and Henry Sinclair probably beat him by one. This novel is Sinclair's story. He was Baron of Rosslyn in southern Scotland and also Jarl of the Orkney Islands, and as White portrays him a fair but firm ruler who went at heads with corrupt bishops and venal noblemen. He got around plenty before embarking on his voyage to North America -- to Norway, the Faroe Islands -- and there's even an amusing scene in the book where visiting England he bumps into that father of literature, Geoffrey Chaucer. The dialogue is superb -- lyrical and almost poetic without sounding aloof. There's striking humor on display, and whether or not it represents 14th-century thought, it's the book's clear signature which sets it above the mainstream. It's long out of print and almost unheard of, which is a shame. The author went on to write his scholarly research on Sinclair's expeditions, called These Stones Bear Witness.	1999-06-28
