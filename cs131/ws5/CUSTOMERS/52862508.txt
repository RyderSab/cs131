This one (the 2nd I've read) was way better, I could tell the difference immediately. Sure there were flaws, but the characters were likeable and the story worked. I enjoy reading this book.

Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book had I not recently finished \\"We Regret to Inform You...\\" (which I highly recommend).

Sarah Stone had an opportunity to enlighten and educate objectively, and it's a shame that she focused on a not very gripping romance instead.	2005-02-16

This book sounded so promising - I'm a sucker for any book about Maine fishermen.  But I was put off by the preachy tone - the author slams us over the head with \\"Julia's independence.\\" I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar, etc, etc.  It would have been a more appealing book if she'd toned the rhetoric down just a bit.  Also, the fact that she ever got involved with someone as distasteful as her husband was unconvincing, some more background might have helped.	2004-09-15

I didn't realize there was a book until the Wall Street Journal recently wrote about a sequel by this author's daughter (also Eleni).<br /><br />The book is incredibly gripping and powerful.  I am pretty middle-of-the-road politically, and used to be somewhat left-leaning in college. However, I found myself feeling that communism is the ultimate evil - I actually had to remind myself how evil totalitarianism on the right can be as well. ANY political system where people can't emigrate freely is EVIL!<br /><br />The stories of family love, village life, and self-sacrifice are stirring to read. I was quite affected by this book.<br /><br />I was, howeer, terribly disappointed by the author's decision regarding the main antagonist (whom he locates years later).	2004-09-15

This one was particularly gripping.  HOWEVER, every ending so far has been ridiculous. I have come to realize that this author always leaves loose ends hanging, and always has an ending that doesn't make sense. However, I am still happy to read her books - the enjoyment I get for 95% of the book more than compensates for the weak endings.	2004-04-23

I am actually rereading it right now.  I was &quot;blown away&quot; the first time, and am enjoying it even more the 2nd  time because I am now alot more knowledgeable about the subject matter. I  thought that Mr. Junger had a perfect balance between telling the story of  one boat, the Andrea Gail, the fishing industry, then and now, and the  science/physics of storms, waves, and drowning.  I've always been  fascinated by these subjects, and, although I'm pretty level-headed and  don't believe in &quot;past lives&quot;, if I DID - I would suspect that I  died at sea - perhaps a sailor, perhaps a whale. This book made me think  alot about fish.  I personally don't eat fish, but there is no reason for  this - just a finicky childhood thing that I never outgrew.  I do eat meat.  However, I don't understand how vegetarians can justify eating fish but not  meat (other than on grounds that fish is healthier for you).  In terms of  both cruelty to animals and environmental impact, I think that eating fish  is FAR WORSE than eating meat.  Cows are not in danger of extinction, and I  think that fish suffer far more when they are slaughtered. Anyway - bravo  Mr. Junger - your next book is eagerly anticipated by this reader.	1999-04-11
