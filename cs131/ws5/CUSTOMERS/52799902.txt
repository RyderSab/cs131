A really well done mystery/thriller, obviously well researched, that takes  you right into the period of history.

However, for me, the chapter  entitled, The Chaplain's Last Sermon, is fantastic.  A Mark Twain-type  satire and a satire on chaplains and prayer and war and thinking that some  god somewhere is listening to our prayers to destroy an enemy.  It brings  to mind Twain's &quot;War Prayer,&quot; but this chapter is much more  developed.  This book would make a hilarious movie.  Thin-skinned officers  might not like it but anyone with a sense of humor will.  Whore House  Charlie lives!!	2000-09-16

Thailand can be very disorienting and can be a  real challenge to our own western values.  The author captures the main  character's journey very well.  His knowledge of Thailand is evident, from  bars to temples to the Golden Triangle to a marriage ceremony.  A well  drawn portrait.	2000-09-14

Memoirs of a Bangkok Warrior is set in Bangkok during the 1960's, a Bangkok far more innocent than it is now.  A time when American GIs could give mess hall apples to taxi drivers in lieu of cash (Thais love apples  but they don't grow well in their climate).  Dean Barrett handles character  and dialogue quite impressively, and his protagonist  (&quot;Pineapple&quot;) is a remarkable reference point amidst the madness  of war in Southeast Asia.  It is a very funny and very special novel,  tremendously entertaining and would make a fun movie.  It is as spicy as  the food of the Thais and his knowledge of both military madness and Thai  culture is obvious.  I also enjoyed the love story between the soldier and  the Thai woman but it is the satirical humor that stands out for me.  A  great read!	2000-02-09

It sounds like Thailand is a great place to be for intrigue.  But the author also goes into the culture of the country which I liked very much.

I think he succeeded in all areas.  In fact, maybe he lived there at the time  because he seems to know every detail.  And yet the details never bog down  the book; in fact, they seem to move the action forward.  The chapters from  the Chinese point of view are wonderful.  Makes it a balanced account and  lets us get into the minds of both sides of the conflict.  Loved it!	1999-07-04

I particularly thought he  captured the psychology of Thai bar girls and their lives really well.  But  he never exploits their lives for color; they seem colorful enough as they  are.   The ending surprised me but it worked.   And when I thought about  it,  it seemed the right one.   Steve Burdick	1999-07-02

The author also has one of his characters mention a Kingdom of Make-Believe at her school where she allows the children to act out their  fantasies.  This is used very well at the end.  This is obviously a very  well thought out novel in which a New York editor receives a mysterious  letter from his brother's widow (a woman he was once in love with) and  that, plus business, sends him back to Thailand after 20 years.  And things  begin to happen: love, danger and lots of people with secrets to hide.  A  fine read.	1999-07-02

New International Fiction)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Moving Story Wonderfully Told	House of the Winds is a wonderful novel of Korea set mainly in the 1960's but its poetic truth transcends any one country or time period.  It is beautifully written without an ounce of self-pity or attempt to impress us  with Asian exotica.   Mia Yun makes every word count and her descriptions  make us deeply feel the happiness and sorrow of the characters.  This is  not the fortune-cookie fiction that sometimes passes as modern Asian or  Asian-American literature.  This is brilliant writing often with stunning   and unexpected metaphors.  The understated yet moving way the writer evokes  the character Bright Bijou allows us to feel the sexual awakening as well  as the crushing despair of a young farm girl even though she is so  different from us.  I very much look forward to Mia Yun's next novel.    Dean Barrett, Author, Hangman's Point	1998-12-16

Rose can be seen as highly intelligent erotica or as a novel with elements of the erotic.  Either way, it makes for fascinating reading, not so much for the erotic scenes (although they are certainly well written) but for the psychological insight into a troubled woman's behavior and identity. The main character disobeys her overbearing psychiatrist husband first, by not taking pills to help (read: control) her, and goes on to conceal her phone sex activities from him.  She finds her strength (and escapes her helpless self into her real self) by asserting her feminine power during phone sex.  She learns she has the ability to take a male caller &quot;from one place and help him arrive at another.&quot;  The activities she is engaged in eventually lead to her involvement with depravity and with the police.  LIP SERVICE is sexy, erotic, and intelligently explores the sexual fantasies of the main character and her customers.  The juxtaposition of upper ! class dinner parties and scenes of sexual awakening add to the book's interest as well.  I highly recommend the novel.<br />Dean Barrett Author, Hangman's Point Village East Books, NYC Publishers of Fine Fiction on Asia HANGMAN'S POINT - A Novel of Hong Kong	1998-07-22
