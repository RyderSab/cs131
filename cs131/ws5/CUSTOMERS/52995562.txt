Based on an account written by a French mariner, it traces one ship's sailing from France, to Africa, to the French colonies in America and then back to France.<br />It places the slave trade in an economic perspepctive while showing the evils of this barbaric trade.  The section on the Middle Passage is especially noteworthy.	2002-01-20

These contributions are equally important in helping this nation's development<br />His strong sense of right comes out on especially two issues.  Opposed to slavery, he took a stand against the tide of what many then believed was proper.  Another aspect is his firm belief in the rule of law.  Imagine the personal courage it took to defend the British soldiers in Boston after that fateful shooting!<br />A major negative for his Presidency, the Alien and Sedition Act, is reasonably explained as an action necessary for the time.  Imagine, the French being a problem and a threat for the young Republic!  An event not usually talked about when discussing the evils of that law.  While not all will agree to this interpretation, it presents good facts for us to consider.<br />Thank you Mr. McCullough for a job well done.	2001-11-02

There are some things that the reader should be aware of.<br />First, the author is correct.  Saladin was a great man.  That is a point too little stressed in traditional teachings of the Crusade.<br />Second.  There are other issues that helped \\"spark\\" the Crusade.  For example, while the takeover of Jerusalem was without bloodshed in 638, it occurred as a result of military force, or what used to called in Arab Conquest.  But the city still contained one of the holiest shrines for Christendom, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  <br />Finally, after many years of Muslem tolerance representing the high point of medieval rule, a new ruler's actions showed a \\"lack of sensitivity.\\"  Caliph Hakim ordered the Church's destruction in 1009.  In an age of religious ideology, this certainly was not the smartest of actions.  <br />In sum, a good book but one needs to remember that both sides showed the complete range of human emotions, both good and bad....	2001-10-27

By that I mean those soldiers and sailors at the ground level.  The lowest level military person of real depth and insight concerned the Air Force Colonel responsible for the successful air doctrine during the Persian Gulf.<br />Too much of the book seemed to focus on the &quot;insider&quot; knowledge of political/beltway ins and outs that pass for connections and insight.  Too many times the author lamented the &quot;what ifs&quot; and lost potential of President Clinton.  That may be true but the bottom line is nobody remembers Presidents who presided during times of peace and prosperity.  Eisenhower, Harding, Taft, etc. are just a few.<br />More important is what was not mentioned.  No reference was either made, or drawn to connect any dots with the Bin Laden connection in Somalia, the first World Trade bomb attempt, the bombing of troops in Saudi Arabia (twice), the Embassy bombings in Africa, and finally, during the Clinton years, the attack on the USS Cole.  Drawing these insights would have cemented the author's position as one with great foresight.  As it is, he is just another well connected insider who missed the early signs of what is now one of our major issues.<br />Perhaps the above is not a fair judgement.  But many, most likely in the press, will start judging the intelligence services and the military for what they should have known.  The author, as one of the foremost in the field, is part of that company.  He too focused on what he knew best and thought was the real story.  By doing that he failed to miss the signs of the pending threats, that with hindsight, many will say were all too obvious.<br />While this book has much that is good background material the final conclusion is that it is lacking.  This book will be better served as a second edition that connects the dots and tapping whatever evidence surfaces about what Clinton knew concerning terrorist and when.  In hindsight it seems those were difficult issues that were avoided and then finally culminated with 9/11.	2001-10-24

His ego got in the way of a great book.  There are some exceptional chapters... the one's that avoid his own personal agenda or self publicity attempts.<br />Yes, our view of the past does needs to be reconsidered, but the attempt to set the record straight is not helped when one, such as Deetz, wants to remind the general reader how &quot;correct&quot; he is, vice those of lessor talent.<br />As for the title, one gets the impression that he was also referring to himself.

Still, it is amazing that a book on the Ottoman Empire has make the History Best Sellers list.

Only four lines for Selim the Grim's  conquest of Iran, Iraq and Egype and Mecca is strange to say the least.   After all, it is the Empire's breakup, combined with the European  partiations, that still influences today's Middle East.

Having lived in Buenos Aires for two years and loving my stay in Argentina, this book was a difficult one to read.  It does not capture the romantic image of Buenos Aires that I like to remember.<br />Still, it is a  very healthy counterpoint that one needs to be aware of if they are going  to live in Buenos Aires as something other than a tourist.  The chapter on  psychoanalysis reflects a special insight on the people who live there.   Alas, her observations were something I heard from many Argentines.  To  this day it is something that I will never understand.<br />Yes, it is true  that a book like this can be written on any city.  In fact, I think Los  Angeles, New York and other U.S. cities already have their fair share!  It  is not especially racist, to use one reviewers words, to spread the wealth  of seeing the less desirable features of any culture.<br />After saying all  that, I like the country and think that France was a little too negative.   Buenos Aires is not a city that tourists will get to know.  It is a city  where one survives on relationships.  As with any place in the world, if  you associate with those of a cheerful and positive outlook, your own views  will be optimistic.  The reverse is also true.	1999-06-11

Its organization and style of writing is not up to the author's past standard.  Perhaps he had a deadline as some have suggested, or perhaps he is just tired of writing.<br />However, the comment  of ignoring the East is not deserved.  First, the author cites that issue  as a limitation in the preface.  He stated it &quot;does not aim to survey  the history of philosophy or religion, It does sample ways of seeking....in  the West.&quot;  Second, most Americans, for whom this book is probably the  main target audience, are not familiar with the roots of their own culture.   For those who seek to learn more, this is a good overview despite its  limitations.  Finally, for those who think non-Western thought should be  included, perhaps future reviewers can list some examples of Eastern seeks  who do not accept the status quo.  Boorstin implies in his book that other  cultures have indeed developed wonderful ideas but that acceptance of  things as they are, instead of challenging and SEEKING has been the result.   This attitude is unjust...and the implication either missed or ignored.	1999-02-21

(Don't  forget those who both sides would in the past have considered  pagans.)<br />But Islam as a religion is not responsible for those events,  just as Christianity cannot be called a religion espousing violence.  Alas,  there are many of all relgions who cloak their actions for power and  vengence in the name of God.<br />The bottom line.  All sides have had a poor  showing for peace!

While the concepts are valid, its packaging strikes one as faddish.<br />Of more serious note is what he fails to discuss; how does an \\"emotionally intelligent\\"  individual survive in a poor organization?  His example of Delta Airlines  showed that the best managers were leaving because of an abusive CEO.   Thus, was it the CEO's lack of emotional intelligence that led to his  downfall or was it the massive exodus of talent \\"voting with their feet?\\"   If those who left had not done so, would the CEO have been ousted?<br />In  short, one can save the price of this book by using common sense.

While sometimes its organization leaves one wondering about the overall  theme, it does cover important points concerning the role of the papacy and  the Reformation.  A good start for those who want a short introduction on  these subjects.<br />While Manchester's interpretation of events can be  questioned, that is different than to say the facts are in error.  For  example, Norman Cantor in the 1993 first edition of \\"The Civilization of  the Middle Ages, A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval  History\\" suffered from serious errors of facts.  On page 123 he stated \\"It  took the Arabs.... seven centuries to take Constantinople.\\"  Anyone remotely  familiar with the history of that event would have known it was the Ottoman  Turks who conquered the city.  As if that was not enough, on page 479 he  went on to state that Marco Polo was Florentine!  While later versions  corrected these mistakes, the point is those mistakes never seemed to get  mentioned as a problem by the initial reviewers!<br />Thus, while Manchester's  wandering may leave you agitated or enlightened, it should not be  dismissed.

His previous book, Inventing the Middle Ages,was great, and based on his comments of other historians, usually non-academic, believed he had high standards.<br />In the first edition hard cover edition, on which part of this review is based, he stated Marco Polo was from Florence and that the Arabs took the Byzantine capital.  Casual readers know that Polo was from Venice and that it was the Turks who conquered Constantinople.  Despite a letter to the publisher, no erata sheet or response was ever received.  It is good to note that Marco Polo is now acknowledged as Venetian, and that while the Turks have not received their due, as least it reads Moslem armies.<br />Still, a scholar of Mr. Cantor's reputation, should have known better.  Even more important, publishers have a obligation to produce erata sheets to ensure that history is as accurate as possible.  (We may have different views o! f objective facts, but these two items are as factual as fallable humans can be sure of.)<br />In short, a readable book that can now be recommended for those who want a good, easy reading introduction.

That may be the real issue for our current force structure.  Some studies already belive they are stretched thin.

One of my favorite editing mistakes was a highly acclaimed book on Medieval history that said Marco Polo was Florentine!  The next printing corrected that error.)  In that light, the n! ext edition of A History of the American People, with updates and corrections, will serve future generations well.  To ensure the best product possible, I hope those who believe they have noted errors will take Mr. Johnson up on his offer, cited in page xv of the preface, to write him with their comments.  He stated \\"Such a fact-filled and lengthy volume as this is bound to contain errors.  If readers spot any, I would be grateful if they would write to me at my private address...&quot;  The published results of this feedback, if any, could also be an interesting book.	1998-07-19

While it does not replace the works of Riley-Smith or others, it is an easy read.  Recommended for those who want a quick introduction to the subject.  My only complaint is that the sources should have been identified.	1998-07-15

The part about keeping his hands on the steering wheel if stopped for a ticket says much.  With regards to Africa, we can give our best wishes and even some assistance, but in the final analysis, true change will have to come from within... especially in how the rulers will help the people, instead of themselves.	1998-07-15
