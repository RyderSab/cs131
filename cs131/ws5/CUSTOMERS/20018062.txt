First at all, this book is not an additional well intentioned book in search of the promised land. It is rather, a kind conversation between a friendly group, where Tom Peters one of the most respectable authorities in the Management, makes an incisive analysis around a set of enrooted paradigms and fixed mental maps. Peters illuminates and allows himself to remark certain half truths we usually assume as holy word. The Managers are manacled by politicians who hinder them to display the take of decision process. On the other hand there is an exacerbated and almost blind faith in what strict and Apollonian planning, that somehow restricts the adequate flexibility in order to react to a competitive environment. There is a hidden fear for bet in favor of the innovation and experimentation. In this sense, this text was one the pioneers in what reengineering and systemic thinking would propose ten years after.<br /><br />The author makes an impressive tour de force, meandering by the intersection points of several disciplines, which we tend to underrate. This reduced vision does not permit an effective response deriving in lack of competitiveness. Those were very hard years for many industries in expansion; the Japanese avalanche began to show.<br /><br />This excess of trust permeated the muscular and nervous system of the American Industry and Europe learned the lesson and reacted faster, through a set of legal restrictions and imposing measures to try to reduce the silent invasion.<br /><br />Of very special interest is the chapter related with the rational model. This mental rigidity plus the multiple bureaucratic gap generated since the very recent rise of prizes in 1973, froze in some way the innovative potentialities in many areas. The politic reaction worked out as a true waterfall in subsequent levels and bridled many brilliants projects.<br /><br />This book is an admirable synthesis of very important age in the recent past but it maintains a prodigious modernity in despite the fact the elapsed time.<br /><br />I recommend sincerely its acquiring.

The perverse reasoning hides behind the suspect: tacit agreement, unconscious behavior, the thin curtain that rules and evolves the essential basis of the human relations is broken. The horror and the magnitude of its repercussions escapes from the scope of legal norms due its unexpected appearance. The terrorist is basically a night creature, a bewildered personality who finds shelter and satisfaction in the collective suffering and the absence of guilty, he simply endorses his moral reliability, masked behind the anonymate and the ideological flags clamor.<br />In ancestral times, the terrorism was focused on public personalities, the case of Archduke Fernando in Sarajevo 1914 is perhaps the most significant evidence. But now the terrorism has specialized, spread and diversified in its targets; the politic mobile has transformed from prime host into a sub category: you can classify them according a quite number of phobias, distorted beliefs, emotional upheavals the perfect expansive outlet to express any disagreement of any nature.<br />Somehow the terrorism has democratized itself. The ancestral behavior codes that reveal a profound discontent, an enervate collective state anguish constitute motives to build an organization.<br />This book presents a systematic analysis made by experts about definitive themes as the moral problem, the transfer of blame, the possible legal rights of the terrorists, the laws of the war and the terrorism.<br />A book of passionately fond content.

In Greece, the birth of the religion sinks in the prehistory and precedes by far, in many centuries to philosophy's appearance. So it looks so weird to us in the actual times to understand wholly the concepts of epiphany, cosmogony or primordial conscious.<br />When Plato talks about Lethes designing it the forgetfulness' river, he appeals to a visual metaphor, because somehow the innate capacity to incorporate the cosmogonist concepts simply are missed. The religion is conceived as the first pattern of the philosophy and not as a syncretism' product and the final crossroads of so many thinking mainstreams.<br />This fact is extremely important because far from enriching the religious principles, weakens them and denotes with all the inhospitable nakedness, the linguistic roots of religion: re-link and that presupposes the ineludible evidence that something missed along the journey.<br />I mean the mythic breath is the most powerful bound of the men to the cosmos.

The novelist C.P.Snow has designed it the problem of the two cultures. Huxley argues that the essence of the conflict can be explained as an opposition stated or not between the private experience and the public, supporting eloquently his thesis with countless examples of the English, Italian and French letters.<br /><br />He even thinks about the rejoin between the science and the literature. In fact Huxley states in this brilliant essay a smart appreciation: \\"Despoiled of its poetry, the trams of the great tragedies are simple articles of the Front Page of any important newspaper. In the highest tragedies as in the low journalism, it is not possible to include the dispassionate observations, the ordered data and the logic thinking of the science.

It is undeniable the violence invades over and over the social life of the mankind, much more than they want to believe. This book is a generous, wide and erudite analysis of the violence in all its aspects: Wertham is a very illustrated man and uses not only sociology and psychology studies but also criminality issues , history, art and literature. He understands the violence not only in its profound historic complexity, but besides he focuses on the quotidian simplicity: from the toys, in mass media and even in the political murderers, in the mutinies and the ineffable wars.  All issues are different but somehow are correlated. He proposes to find its internal connections and carve in relief the latent violence under the mask that retain. There are so may unknown, interweaved and unthinkable points of view that you will find important material to discuss and reflect.<br /><br />Even the first edition dates from 1966, the book remains as a must reference for those who are really interested in that crucial theme.	2005-06-12

Far beyond of your ancestral fears, unconscious collective and some other limiting factors deeply fixed in your values scale, the author makes of the will the real instrument for fight and win. The will is synonym of power and ability to turn off the accustomed expression so enrooted in the most of people: I can not do that because ....  And so the life escapes and you with it.<br /><br />Somerset Maugham invocated a famous statement: You can argue one thousand of reasons for not making anything but not a single excuse. Will phonetically is so related with wheel that it sounds more than logic to assume the sense of movement implies the fact of challenge and fight daily and constantly. And this is a smart point to remark, due as you know every day is different to another , and your yesterday's victory has nothing to do with your possible victory and the end of the day.  I mean the hunter paradigm must permeate your soul and conscious. Your abilities, strengths and weakness must compose a whole sum, your helmet and sword, with all the vigor and enthusiasm you have. Because the nature is not the world. And many times we tend to forget this aspect. The nature does not know pity, forgiveness, faith or hope. The nature claims by the surviving of all the species, but survive demands a prize: keep on fighting without any reward. That is why the happiness to my mind is not a special mood and is in nowhere, the happiness resides in the fight by itself. While you are fighting you must be happy: the absence of fight is simply the death and the death is the peace. The fight for surviving implies the absence of peace, because it demands you to take decisions constantly.<br /><br />Try for this book splendidly written and meticulously explained.	2005-05-26

The first little detail that called me powerfully my attention was the his birth date: July 7, just twenty seven years after Mahler's birthday. He was a poet, an individualist, and a lonely artist. Absolutely divorced from this almost genetic standpoint to follow the road about the traditional slave art's autarchy, however, he will always maintain the essential roots of his Jewish ancestors. The vanishing perspectives of the most of his works would seem a dreamy pattern, challenging and daring all kind of conventionalism.<br /><br />\\"It must no paint pictures with symbols. When an artwork is really authentic, exist by themselves symbolism in it\\". That sharp reflection is so narrowed linked with a Robert Bresson 's  statement: \\"Let the facts lead to the feelings and not vice versa\\"<br /><br />Consider his most famous painting: The three candles, where the lovers couple defy not only the gravity 's acceleration, but are by themselves a real breakthrough with the oppressed human beings. The sad harlequin and the tragic red, the couple is just so far from being happy, they weep the invisible presence of the implacable menace. There' s an incisive line in Fassbinder' s Maria Braun in which she says in imperceptibly to her sister: \\"All the happy persons seem to be some vulgar, when one is unhappy\\".<br /><br />Particularly interesting are the mythic cycle between 1975 and 1977 with those admirable motives.

He decides to design his beloed son in law as his succesor and so he will teach every little detail the multiple insights of his job. The irony will load the screen and your laughs may be due the most chilling expression of irony so few times expressed in the cinema story.<br />And finally one of the funniest and sublime portraits ever made in the Civil Spanish War: The liitle cow: In the middle of one confrontation, one of the enemies forces is informed the other band has a cow and with the hunger they have they establish a sinister plan: to steal the cow and avoid the enemy can eat it.<br />This book presnets a very important compilation of his complete filmography and the sharp intelligence of this notable creator will astonish you from the first pages.<br />If you are interested in this important stage of the Franquist Spain, you will obtain a real surprise about what the human being is able to make still in the most oprseeive conditions.<br />Berlanga died but his legacy will remain as a vital proof of the dissobey, the raw material of the children, heros and artists.tory.

Messens, Camille Goemans, Marcel Lecomte and Paul Nogu&eacute;, he formed a kind of Belgian surrealist group. In 1927 he established close ties with Breton and Eluard, moving back to Brussels in 1939 until his death in 1967.<br /><br />He began as a Cubist and his first Surrealist pictures were painted after 1925.  In his search of the unfathomable mystery that surrounds to things and living beings. So starting from daily reality, he follows a distinct route, he best for the logic in the multiple associations and ideas. Being an avid reader of detective stories and a big fan of Edgar Allan Poe, you may understand why his style fits so well defined in this category. He painted isolated fragments of objects set in landscapes in the same vein of De Chirico his most remarkable influence received. And according Scheneede's opinion \\"If we regard Duchamp as the prototype of the scandalous, Man ray the prototype of the inventive and Max Ernst the prototype of the inspirative artist, Magritte have to be called the prototype of the intellectual artist\\".  That' s why Magritte developed the symbolism mixing elements of the reality and facing them with itself in such original way supporting in just an unique logic puzzle as anyone else. Dali, in the other hand blended reality with archetypical dreams or reality surrounded by unconscious gaze gifted with a major doses of black humor and cynicism.<br /><br />The author Jacques Meuris is emeritus Professor of the Superior School of Visual Arts in Brussels and makes an admirable artistic effort with exquisite reproductions of this notable artist: an authentic icon among the Surrealist giants.

The most haunting esay would be to my mind How the poor people die , a very touching reference around the fear felt for the poor people to the hospitals.<br /><br />Lear , Tolstoi and the fool is a fascinating tour de force work in which Orwell reveals the deep aversion of Tolstoi for Shakespeare specially in King Lear where Tolstoi this is the most insane work of this overrated writer according his point of view . He dares to conclude Shakespeare was never an artist , he argues that Shakespeare worked out under the Machiavelian principle the goal justifies the ways . And believe or not Tolstoi dares to affirm the presence of the fool in the play has no sense . Obviously Tolstoi had many blind points and that blindness may be well in the fact it is difficult for a human being born in a nation controlled by a Czarist Regime  almost ten centuries about the involved issues in the Aristocratic atmosphere of  a country wahich worked as World Empire ; that little detail may be the great difference when to the eyes of Tolstoi the Czarist Regime was authoritarian but never reached the scope about the internal affairs of the power specially in this work who might be well an anti climax and totally different in spirit to the rest of Shakespeare works .<br /><br />Politics against literature : An exam of Gulliver travels is a careful study and analysis of the meaning of this bitter novel .<br /><br />The jewel crown may be shared for these three essays : the politics and the English Idiom in which he deals with the decadence and the terrible employment of the idiom  , Reflections about Gandhi  and Reconsiderations about James Burnham .<br /><br /> A fundamental text for those who are really interested in this notable thinker , the same author of 1984 and Animal Farm.	2004-11-21

His huge culture allowed him to explore all the known items. I must recognize that with the astonishing exception of a \\"Brave new world\\", as novelist, he doesn't have much to offer. I'd rather prefer his meticulous essays in multiple directions.<br />This book, in particular may be a good star for all who pretend to get into the Huxley's world.<br />I read that book in the middle of the seventies, and the first you acknowledge is the visible enchantment that gives to every note. In fact, Huxley was a fan of William Blake, and that explains the title \\"The doors of perception\\" (Jim Morrison was too a fervent reader of Blake).<br />The approach given for Huxley in The doors... is like he and us were in an opened conference with no restrictions of any subject.<br />The explanations above the different ways you may reach of reducing the efficiency of the \\"third eye\\" is ravishing. You read page after with anxiety for absorbing every little commentary or observation. The links inmediatly leads you to Loudun's demons (which served to Ken Russell for making a film entitled The demons, with Oliver Reed) (in my point of view his most complete work),<br />Heaven and hell is an autobiografical experience, in which he is under the effects of the mescaline, a plant used in Mexico. This mind journey is supported by recordings made in company with his wife and a friend of them. So this reading is just an overlapping of all the process.<br />In the seventies, too many things shocked the world. The end of Vietnam's war, The Watergate affair, the prizes of oil established by the OPEC in 1973. Those were the days in which Marcuse and Erich Fromm hold a wide audience all around the world.<br />And in this sense, this book became a landmark, because the huge amount of items that troubled to Huxley , such he refers us in a \\"New visit to a brave new world\\", The island (the other side of the coin respect a New brave world), Huxley added it no limits territories, a true example of what you may define like a reinassance man.

It's well known the deep impact that the russian literature of the XIX century shocked all the world. The presence of Pushkin, Gogol, Tolstoi and this giant Fedor Dostoievsvki signed and even made grow up the russian character to a peak that literally surpased all the expectatives.<br />In my opinion, Crime and Punishment establishes one of the starting point of the existencialist movement years after. Let's consider, by example that Albert Camus' brilliant work named \\"The happy death\\" , and clearly you'll feel in the ten first pages the presence of the fate struggling all the performers. Mersault is in fact a far descendent of the mean character in Crime.<br />A ruman writer (Virgil Gheorghiou) told once in one of his works that amazing thought:\\"The sin hurts much more in the memory than in the flesh\\" .<br />And this is the clue to understand the sense of loss, the feeling of desperation, the loneliness in all its crude nakedness, the shame weights much more in his mind that in the rules that his crime implies. In the case of Mersault in Camus'work, the victim follows what you might consider like a suggested homicide . In other words the fear to commit suicide  seems to permeate the atmosphere in all the work.<br />Dostoievski makes us drowning with all these characters in an ocean of deep implications, there's no doubt in the punishement; but Dostoievski makes a moral crossroad and carries by the dark shadows of this hell so particularly russian. Consider , by example the paintings of Blockin, the sense of horror in the most remarkable symphonies of Shostakovich, the sinister phantoms of Rachmaninov in his Symphonic dances. The religion, the fact you can't ignore . all the political opression all along so many centuries, have created a human being very special in the western tradition. And all these sociological aspects that depicts a soul , the sense of nosthalgia that so well defined oncethe celebrated filmaker Andrei Tarkovski (1932-1986), when he was forced to leave URSS in 1979 whe he showed his work Stalker. Remeber that his following issue was titled Nosthalghia ( and this is not a mere casuality).<br />When you read this book, consider you are reading more than book, you are getting close to the soul and the fears of the russian people. May be you (like me) are able to understand deeper than any essay the essential facets of this nation, his glory and his disgraces.tradition.
