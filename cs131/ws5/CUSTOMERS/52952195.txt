Crumb Handbook	Books	5	2	3	N	N	All-American, All Crumb, All Genius	There are many Crumb books and other media available, but this one is well-worth picking up whether this is your first or 50th book by this all-American master.  What's different here is Crumb narrates his life's journey in his own voice, an insightful and analytical prose style that is as unique and penetrating as his art.  He supplements his observations on growing up in the suburbs in the 40s and 50s -- steeped in Treasure Island, Disney, and TV culture -- with copious photos, illustrations, pieces from his brother Charles, and many many glimpses deep in the heart of this intelligent, sensitive, and severely depraved artist.  His comments on the effects of our consumer culture on him and his family are reflective and personal, rendered with humor and keyed to various comic creations of his over the years, many of them graphic, sick, twisted, brutally honest, or just plain brutal.  But you will not put this down.<br /><br />This is a fresh look at this artist, in multi-media format, by the artist himself.  A great idea, well-executed.  Mr. Natural says:  buy this book!	2005-08-15

However, it could have been much better edited, much of the information is repeated again and again in chapters that relate to certain comics, such as chapters on Mel Brooks, Sid Caesar, Woody Allen, who all shared certain experiences, but they are all relayed again in each comic's individual chapter.<br /><br />And, due to the format, little depth is provided in terms of analysis or the particulars of any one comic or style of comedy.  In sum, I would recommend if you would like to learn a little about many of these great comics, but you would need to look elsewhere for substantive analysis or a deeper understanding of the era or the comics in question.	2005-07-27

His posts there are thoughtful and nuanced.  Not this.  It seems to me the publisher \\"dumbed down\\" the book for its expected readership, diluting and flattening out the nuance and argumentation, leaving a lot of rhetoric, extended block quotes, and Rush Limbaugh.  With the judiciary under attack as the only branch not currently under the political control of the Republican party, it does not surprise that judges have become targets of the other branches of government.  There is surely much food for thought regarding Marbury vs. Madison, federalism, and the role of an independent judiciary in our system of government, but I think much of the analysis has been left on the cutting room floor.  I'd be interested in an unabridged version of this book, or perhaps will just keep reading Mark's posts in The Corner.	2005-04-07

Unfortunately, her writing skills are not on par with her research abilities, and the book often feels like an extended graduate paper, badly in need of expert revision and editing.  The writing style is slightly stale and turgid, so even exciting events are flattened and reduced to yet another episode of graduate study documentation.<br /><br />Also, while I am for the most part in agreement with the views of the author and no fan of the British empire or its impact on colonial cultures, I must say Ms. Elkins is a bit over-the-top in her defense of the Mau Mau rebels and her indictment of their British overlords.  It's rare in 2005 to see an author boldly defending the local African custom of female genital circumcision, or the blood oaths of the Mau Mau which required taking a life and ingesting parts of the human sacrifice.<br /><br />On the whole, the book is an impressive first effort and a solid example of graduate-level research.  I believe a more textured, nuanced approach to this material can be written, building on the  first-hand accounts that Ms. Elkins has so comprehensively collected.	2005-02-08

What I found difficult was the author's stinginess with maps (one map per retreat, no exceptions), and the overly technical and jargoned tone of the prose.  I also found his digressions into general politics unnecessary and, for the most part, wrong (do you really believe our fighting in Vietnam led to Gorby's dismantling of the Communist system in Russia?)  But overall, I enjoyed the book and found the military history to be very informative, well-researched, and accurate.  An entertaining read.	2005-01-20

Maraniss is a master storyteller, and the book reads like great fiction, yet lives were lost, and made, in those three days.  Stories of valor, death, and putting oneself on the line for something you believe in -- all are here in a breathtaking narrative.<br /><br />For those who questioned the moral fortitude necessary to come back from that war and work to end it, as John Kerry and many others did, please read this book and try to understand better the journey that these brave men and women -- and their compatriots in the colleges nationwide -- took to make America a better place.	2005-01-17

The primary failing of the book is its lack of historical context and poor scholarship.  The premise is certainly provocative and interesting and no doubt a study of the Franco-American relationship will be written that is fully sourced and researched. This one is mired in the politics of the Chirac government's opposition to unilateral US action in Iraq in the fall of 2002-03, and is written entirely through the prism of a partisan who is still angry at their position.  As a result, the book is a product of our highly-charged partisan present, and not written with an eye toward a full understanding of the blessings and (sometimes) curse of being \\"friends\\" with the French.  John Miller can do a lot better, and I hope he puts aside the partisanship for his next book, because he is otherwise a thoughtful and interesting author.	2004-10-25

Boy was I wrong!  Swofford's writing style is exceptional, brutally honest, almost Hemingway-like in its economy of prose, and I found myself completely captivated by his tales of bravery, savagery, stupidity, and personal redemption.  Anyone who blithely sends our young to war better read this book, so you have a greater understanding of the sacrifices involved.  With the current adventure in Iraq leading to increasing devastation and tragedy, it is helpful to read a first-hand account of a war strategy that accomplished its objectives, that was well-planned and executed, and one that did not lead our boys into mission-creep and ambiguous objectives of \\"nation-building\\" -- with no real end in sight.  A must read, I look forward to his next book.	2004-10-13

It takes a real man and a sober sense of self and morality for someone as esteemed by the Bushies as Clancy to admit the obvious -- the attack on Iraq was a huge blunder, a miscalculation of the highest order, whether done for the right reasons or not.  I admire Clancy, who is joined by the estimable Zinni, for staking out this position (for which he will undoubtedly lose those Clancy fans still drinking the Government Kool-Aid about Iraq, Chalabi, WMDs, etc.).  It take guts -- and Clancy and Zinni have 'em. Let's hope the Kool-Aid drinkers don't start the attack machine on these two, the way they brutalized Scott Ritter, Hans Blix, Richard Clarke, Joe Wilson, Paul O'Neill etc.  Just read the book, open your eyes, and learn the truth.

Instead, I find myself completely surprised and amazed that Shiner has pulled it off!  He really brings alive LA in the 1960s, and makes you really feel that you are right there with Brian Wilson as he finally finishes &quot;Smile&quot; or hanging out on Sunset Strip with Jim Morrison on a drunken, wild bender....<br />This is a highly imaginative and creative book, taking a great concept and just executing it beautifully.  On top of that, Shiner has weaved in a very moving story of personal redemption, a marriage on the rocks, and a sense that the ideals of the 60s have been lost or diluted through time, attrition, and missed opportunities.<br />If you have an interest in this subject matter, you will enjoy this book and turn every page with interest, waiting for the next flight of fancy of the very creative mind of Lewis Shiner.	2004-05-06

She begins the book with a very moving personal anecdote regarding her child and her faith that I found moved me to tears.  This is followed by a fair and objective analysis of the recently-uncovered Gospel of Thomas and its contrast and comparisons to the Gospel of John.  Along the way, readers will be fascinated by the machinations and different spiritual approaches taken by various early Church leaders and sects.  In all, a very satisfying book on a worthwhile topic.<br />If you are open-minded and willing to learn something new about the early formation of Christianity, then you will find this book informative and thought-provoking.  If your mind is closed to this topic, you have no need for the research this scholar provides, and can move on to another book that confirms and re-affirms your (limited) world-view.	2004-04-28

In my view (and the view of the author), these acts were completely justifed.<br />  Flyboys tells the remarkably savage and brutal tale of the Japanese mistreatment and murder of 8 fighter pilots over the South Pacific in the last year of World War II.  What the book brilliantly does is place that savagery in context, exploring Japan-American relations over the last two centuries, and reflecting on how the Japanese military perverted ancient Japanese codes of conduct to justify a war of aggression.  Apparently, many reviewers cannot possibly even entertain the author pointing out that America also expanded across the continent and elsewhere by aggressively conducting war (against the Mexicans, the Spanish, Native Americans etc.), or that American leaders responded to Japanese barbarity by dehumanizing the enemy and by firebombing major urban Japanese population centers.  Not only that, FDR blatantly covered up the civilian targets and deaths with euphemistic language and insistence that the bombs dropped were intended for military targets only, not civilian population centers.  Of course, given the nature of the enemy resistance, the reader is not led to conclude that the firebombs were illegitimate means to end the war.  Rather, they were necessary to save massive American casualties from a ground invasion of Japan.  The author treats this subject very fairly and does a masterful job of putting the decisions made by our leaders in context, with solid historical sourcing.<br />  To me, this effort to place the primary story in historical context is one of the best features of the book.  The book is meticulously researched, and every fact recounted is supported by citation and documentation.  The book is a brutal and horrific look at the Pacific war, and is unforgettable.  You will be very moved by the end of this book, and will look at the veterans of the Pacific war with new-found respect and admiration for a difficult job performed with unusual bravery and courage.rrific look at the Pacific war, and is unforgettable.
