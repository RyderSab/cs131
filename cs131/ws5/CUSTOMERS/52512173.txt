US	52512173	R2TBLAY5IB8E57	1402729901	827683506	The Pocket Book of Patriotism	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Great reference with healthy perspective	In 2005, The Harris Poll conducted a survey that showed less than a quarter of American citizens had a basic--and I do mean basic--understanding of how the federal government is structured. Thus, it's very likely that any person reading this view lacks the basic information for meeting the duties of responsible citizenship. This book offers a means to correct that problem, if you are such a person. <br /> <br />In another 2005 incident, an honors student in college did not know which came first--the Vietnam War or the French-American War. Part of the blame lies in the alleged \\"news coverage\\" spewed by American television networks and other sources of disinformation--how are young people supposed to learn the truth in a barrage of sensationalism and extremely biased \\"reporting?\\" <br /> <br />But it goes deeper than the television problem--too few citizens have a handy reference for reviewing and later referring to seminal events in American and World history, and so they find it nearly impossible to sort fact from fiction. This book solves that problem. <br /> <br />Aside from the introduction, this book has no narrative. So, it's a quick read. Most of it consists of a highly informative timeline--something I've often wanted but did not have, until now. This timeline consists of two columns on each page. The left column is for events in American history, while the right is for events in world history. It's illuminating to see these laid out side by side, for any given year. Being a history buff myself, I looked hard for some failure or error in this timeline. I didn't find one. <br /> <br />After the timeline, the book offers a \\"Part Two,\\" which contains the following information: <br />*Speeches, charters, and significant documents <br />*Lyrics of patriotic songs <br />*Poems and verse <br />*A listing of United States Presidents along with their dates of service <br />*The states, listed in the order in which they joined the union <br />*Quotations on patriotism <br />*Medals of valor and what they mean <br />*Flag traditions and flag ettitiquette <br />*Oaths and pledges <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that the author draws a distinction between nationalism and patriotism. It's also interesting to note that Foreman is no knee-jerk, wide-eyed, flag-waving fanatic. The book gives a bit of perspective with his short bio.	2005-10-02

Because I receive phone calls from US soldiers and civilians serving or working in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bosnia, I have a bit of insight into this situation. What most people spew as fact is merely rewarmed televised propaganda with little or no basis in reality. <br /> <br />Thus, it was refreshing to read Gerges' well-researched book. Gerges is authoritative, not opinionated. This is evident in his extensive use of letters written by various key players in the global jihad psychodrama. <br /> <br />One of the points he discussed was how the Muslim mainstream has rejected Osama bin Laden--and why. Through my volunteer work in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), I have been interacting with Muslims for many years--long before September 11. My opinion of these people has nothing to do with their religion. I have found them to be intelligent, hard-working, considerate, and giving. Not at all the characterization we find being put forth by our more \\"insulated\\" fellow citizens. Being of Sicilian decent myself, I know a thing or two about being \\"suspected\\"--as many innocent Muslims are today. <br /> <br />The situation in the Middle East is not one of a monolithic Muslim culture waging war against the so-called \\"Christian\\" nations. In France, Muslims outnumber Catholics and Protestants combined. Any time I read a book or article about Jihad, I know the author has stepped into \\"stupidland\\" as soon as there's mention of \\"the Middle East Muslims still fighting the Crusades against Europe.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, in the minds of a few zealot Muslims, the Crusade thing is true. But let's not forget we have zealot \\"Christians\\" in the USA running around in bed sheets and lighting crosses on people's front lawns. In both cases, religious leaders have declared the zealots as acting in violation of their respective scriptures. Broad generalizations based on special cases may be normal for American mainstream media, but that doesn't make them correct or useful. <br /> <br />Gerges doesn't make any generalizations. In fact, I had to stop reading at a few points to wonder what point he was trying to make. When I did that, I realized it wasn't about selling his point to the reader. At those few points where I had to stop to digest the material before moving on, Gerges was going in-depth and making me out together a structure of points. The global Jihad isn't a linear thing, or something you can boil down to a few trite statements. It was great to see someone treat this complex subject with the in-depth examination and evidence it deserves. <br /> <br />So, what can you expect to find in this book that I like so much? Gerges starts out with a lengthy introduction that gives perspective on September 11. Then he addresses the Afghan War (U.S.-backed Taliban against the U.S.S.R.) and how that sowed the seeds of transnational Jihad. It's worthwhile to read that twice. <br /> <br />Then, he takes the reader through various writing and testimony showing the tension between various groups and alliances, and how Osama bin Laden forced the issue of international Jihad. Osama bin Laden wanted to \\"attack the head of the snake,\\" meaning the USA. Gerges doesn't mention this, but I find it interesting that it was US troops who saved thousands of Muslim men, women, and children in the Balkans in the 1990s while Osama bin Laden did nothing for them. <br /> <br />But Gerges does take many sharp jabs at bin Laden, and he is not alone. With his hatred and his \\"glorious\\" attacks of September 11, bin Laden did immense damage to his own movement. This caused a split in the Jihadis, which Gerges discusses in depth. <br />This book offers much more, which I won't go into here. If you want to understand what's been driving these fanatics, this book will help you enormously. Positive change is occurring, and our leaders will have to be careful not to tip things back the other direction. <br /> <br />Understanding what is going on can help us cope with the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that are compounded by the biased reporting and sensationalist news coverage that poison public opinion. But I think it's also important that we in the West don't succumb to the same narrow-minded hatred that fueled this whole global Jihad to begin with. <br /> <br />Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance and on form. This book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE). This was a refreshing change from the Pidgin English that so many of today's authors slop onto our reading palettes. The care taken in writing this book shows that the author and publisher actually cared about the reader. That's a huge plus.	2005-09-30
US	52512173	R3C9BW8S9INR2E	1579548970	218702059	Why Men Never Remember and Women Never Forget	Books	5	86	90	N	N	The antidote to relationship-poisoning perceptions	Diversity is great, but tolerance and understanding are rare. Men often expect women to think and behave as men, and vice-versa. When this doesn't happen, we can be impatient to the point of rudeness. Women frequently assume an insult or indifference that isn't there. Men are frequently miffed when women dredge up an issue we thought was already resolved. The misperceptions can easily poison a relationship, and often do. <br /> <br />But men and women are attracted to each other precisely because we are different. We complement each other. Perhaps if we understand in what ways we are constitutionally different, we'll not only tolerate the differences but learn to enjoy them. This book provides the means to take a giant step in that direction. <br />While the \\"why\\" of these differences is a matter of philosophy, religion, and speculation, the \\"what\\" of them is becoming increasingly clear. Dr. Legato reveals the \\"what\\" in a nonjudgmental manner. As a physician, she's trained to analyze information and provide healing advice--that's her perspective. This book reflects that, thus making it a useful tool to anyone seeking to have healthy relationships. <br /> <br />We all are familiar with the sex-specific traits that irritate and exasperate. Most of us aren't familiar with the studies that show men and women process information with different parts of their brains. We aren't familiar with the myriad other differences, and these go all the way down to the cellular level. <br />This book begins with a scenario that sounds all too familiar. It's a quarrel, and you can empathize with both sides as it unrolls. Dr. Legato then takes us behind that quarrel, showing that neither side intended anything negative. But the perceptions of negative intention ran high. <br /> <br />If men can learn to say, \\"She's going to have these expectations of me,\\" we can prevent the kinds of arguments that drive us nuts. Dr. Legato provides insight as to what those expectations might be. Not that we men need to make a list. We just need to remember a few key things, such as the fact that women are nearly always multi-tasking and they hear and listen differently than we do. <br /> <br />If women can learn to say, \\"He's going to have his own expectations and not see and hear things the way I do,\\" they can also prevent many of the arguments that drive them nuts. As Dr. Legato is a woman and does not pretend to think like a man, she takes the female perspective in much of her text. Personally, I hate it when someone with expertise in one area just assumes expertise in another--so I found Dr. Legato's intellectual honesty to be a real plus. <br /> <br />Part of her intellectual honesty involves looking at things from the physician's perspective, and not pretending to psychoanalyze the entire human race. So, we readers are treated to seeing how the physical brain and the physical body affect our behavior, thought processes, interpersonal communications, and other aspects of who we are and how we relate to others. <br />But this necessarily opens the door to some other issues, which she discusses in the last three chapters. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 discusses the differences in how men and women react to stress, and the implications that has for us. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 looks at depression, and this information alone justifies the cost of the book because most people who are depressed don't know it and therefore don't do anything about it. Depression is probably more the rule than the exception, though we typically think of depressed people as folks on the verge of suicide. So we think that if we're not feeling suicidal then we must not be depressed. That misperception greatly diminishes our ability to function wholly and to fully enjoy life. Get the book, and read this chapter first. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 touches on a topic that is, frankly, scary to many of us. You've had those days when you can't find your keys, when you jokingly refer to \\"having a senior moment,\\" or can't remember a friend's phone number. And you wonder, \\"Am I developing Alzheimer's?\\" You may also wonder what's wrong with you these days, because you have once again agreed to be in two places at once. As the frequency of these events increases, our response goes from disturbing to alarming. <br /> <br />Understanding what is going on can help us cope. If you're over 40, get the book for this chapter alone. Not only will it help you understand your own situation, but it will help you be more patient with your aging mentors and other important people who increasingly seem to be losing the sharpness that once impressed the heck out of you. <br /> <br />A book like this doesn't come along every day. Nor do we, as people, think much about why we have problems between the sexes. Put these two facts together, and you have a solution to some of the most vexing annoyances that plague us. <br /> <br />Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance and on form. This book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE). This was a refreshing change from the Pidgin English that so many of today's authors slop onto our reading palettes. The care taken in writing this book shows that the author and publisher actually cared about the reader. That's a huge plus.	2005-09-09
US	52512173	R2XVQ93URI7ZKU	141372518X	600135679	Trash Talk: An inspirational guide to saving time and money through better waste and resource management	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Save money and help the earth	When I was very young, the authorities drained most of a small lake in the state park near my home. My mother took my best buddy and me out to the lake, and we walked around for hours picking up trash. It was a stewardship lesson I never forgot. To paraphrase Audrey Hepburn in \\"Roman Holiday,\\" I will treasure that time cleaning up the lake for as long as I shall live. <br /> <br />But, it was one of many lessons about being a responsible resident of the planet. I grew up in a home where we already practiced much of the advice in Trash Talk. That made us unusual, in a positive way. As an adult, I continue those same practices--because they are good for the earth and good for my wallet. They simply make sense. <br /> <br />I did learn some new things from Trash Talk, which in itself was a surprise because I am noted for being able to stretch a buck and not waste things. I like the ability to live cheaply without being a cheapskate to do it. Not all surprises are good, but this one was. And I've already begun implementing some of what I've learned. Even very frugal, waste-conscious people are likely to realize monthly savings in excess of what they paid for this book. The average person could easily save that much each week. <br /> <br />As a professional speaker on time management, I was delighted with the way the Brummets organized this book. The \\"don't waste\\" philosophy of Trash Talk also applied to the actual reading of the book. That shouldn't be surprising, as planning and organization are key elements of reducing trash and cutting costs. <br /> <br />Trash Talk explains the three Rs: Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle. It then adds a fourth R: Refuse (as in, refuse to buy the wrong items). These principles form the foundation for the hundreds of useful tips in Trash Talk. <br /> <br />The book is organized into four parts. <br /> <br />Part One addresses commonly wasted items and explains how to reduce waste and extend the usefulness of each item. Every item has its ownsection, and each section ends with a bulleted list of the benefits from following the advice in that section. The items include such things as bags, carpets, cloth, containers, dryer sheets, furniture, glass, hangers, nylons, plastic rings, soap, and toothbrushes. <br /> <br />Part Two is less oriented around specific products and more around areas of concern. Each of these has its own section, as well (again, with those wonderful bulleted lists). Areas of concern include energy use, holidays, indoor air, infant and feminine hygiene, kitchen waste, organic gardening, and water use. <br /> <br />Part Three is really about saving trees. There's much more to this than most people realize. If everyone followed some simple steps, as outlined in Trash Talk, the benefit to our forests, streams, and air would be immense. <br /> <br />Part Four provides short examples of good things happening. The point of including these is to show that significant trash reduction is a reality for many corporations and other organizations. An extensive list of resources follows the examples. <br /> <br />Form is important and Trash Talk could use some editing. But even so, it was enjoyable read and easy to understand. This book is valuable, in many ways. First, remember that this book is a financial investment. It will pay dividends exceeding its purchase price, not long after you start putting it to use. Second, it provides badly-needed advice on how to be good citizens of the world. It's not a \\"feel good\\" book written by some politician or celebrity who wants to spout some politically correct blather. It's a practical \\"how to\\" guide written by people who walk the walk. <br /> <br />Buy this book for yourself. But also consider giving it as a gift to others. It may be one of the most durable gifts you have ever bestowed on another person. Your planet will thank you.	2005-08-03
US	52512173	R2FDMHXKL67PGN	0521853044	666185994	God vs. the Gavel: Religion and the Rule of Law	Books	5	50	61	N	N	A Balanced Look at Righting Judicial Incompetence	When you think of people who break the law and get by with it, what kind of person comes to mind? A rogue bureaucrat who can arrange an audit of anyone who opposes him? A cop on the take, who can hide some evidence and manufacture the rest? A celebrity who can buy a trial, and later write a book about it? <br /> <br />If so, expand your thinking a bit. The ability to break the law goes beyond individuals whom we easily recognize as seedy, scheming characters. Some people use our most cherished institutions as vehicles for such criminal activities as child abuse, murder, and theft. Those seem like strong words at first blush, but case histories show those claims are accurate. <br /> <br />And the courts routinely aid and abet these crimes by providing exceptional protection to those who commit them. Thanks to Constitution-violating court decisions, criminals who hide behind the mantle of religion remain free to strike again and again. At the heart of this maelstrom of magisterial malfeasance, we find the issue of church vs. state. Hamilton looks at this issue closely, and lays to rest the myths upon which courts justify their complicity with criminals who happen to represent religious organizations. Replace the myths with truths, and the entire house of cards tumbles. <br /> <br />The courts, in their support of religious offenders, are doing religious organizations no favor. Just look at what has happened to the Catholic church. The Catholic church continues to harbor pedophile priests, and the courts help them do it. This has diminished the church to most Catholics--many of whom are becoming ex-Catholics. Consequently, many Catholic schools are closing their doors and the treasuries of Catholic congregations are on life support. <br /> <br />The Catholic church isn't alone in sowing the seeds of its own destruction. Hamilton shares several examples--from several religions, including Jewish, Protestant, Catholic, and Muslim--where the leaders of a religious group show complete disregard for the public good or for people outside their group. In many of these cases, the religious leaders behaved so poorly that you have to wonder if they are religious people at all. Innocent citizens then turn to their government for assistance and come away with nothing but a judicial farce. <br /> <br />God vs. the Gavel takes us into the world of judicial incompetence that ignores the concepts of fairness and justice. It's a place where the separation of powers isn't, but where the corruption of power is. Judges routinely misconstrue, misapply, and mislegislate from the bench. This, despite the fact they have a duty to discern the facts and are Constitutionally barred from legislating. <br /> <br />Hamilton isn't on a crusade against religion, religious organizations, or religious people. But she is against using religion as a license for behaving in a loveless, predatory manner that hurts and kills other people. She is opposed to using \\"religious freedom\\" as a free pass for torturing children. She is opposed to using \\"religious freedom\\" as justification for destroying entire neighborhoods. She is opposed to using \\"religious freedom\\" to justify forcing our prisons to spend millions of dollars \\"accommodating\\" dozens of different religious meal restrictions, religious reading requirements, and the demands of new \\"religions\\" formed for the express purpose of gaming the system. Buy this book for no other reason than to read the lists of lunacy on page 157 - 161, and you have spent your money well. <br /> <br />So, what does Hamilton want, and why does she go through such effort to show us what's wrong with the status quo? What Hamilton is asking for is a balanced approach that respects the rights of everyone. In her vision of how things should be, judges would abandon circular reasoning and twisted logic--in favor of common sense. <br /> <br />She explains the \\"do no harm\\" principle, and she shows us how reasonable accommodation of religion can and does work. For example, the US military changed its policy to allow soldiers to wear unobtrusive religious gear such as yarmulkes and crosses. That's very different from using \\"religious freedom\\" to sentence an innocent child to death by refusing life-saving blood transfusion. And it's very different from ignoring zoning laws so a religious meeting place transforms a quiet suburban neighborhood into a high-traffic thoroughfare. <br /> <br />God vs. the Gavel is more than just a fascinating expose. Hamilton also offers a vision of how things should be. People who use religion as a license to victimize others will oppose losing that license, and will thus oppose the change that Hamilton is trying to bring about. But people who, like Hamilton, see religion as bringing meaning and guidance to life will very likely agree with her. <br /> <br />Religious leaders who seek to be above morality and the law often claim First Amendment rights. And the courts normally comply with those leaders in knee-jerk fashion, even when no First Amendment issue is involved. <br /> <br />The First Amendment reads, \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\\" <br /> <br />Nothing in the First Amendment gives any religion special status under the law. The First Amendment merely bars Congress from making laws against particular religions. Hamilton explains the history and reasoning behind this right. But the courts routinely ignore the Constitution, history, and reasoning--so that they can give religious organizations or their leader special status under the law. The consequences of that special status should have us all worried. <br /> <br />A note on the writing. I review quite a few books, and have grown disgusted with the sloppiness trend. Thus, it is now my policy to let potential readers and buyers know about the quality of the writing itself. Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance and on form. This book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE). This is a refreshing change from the Pidgin English that so many of today's authors slop onto our reading palettes. The care taken in writing this book shows that the author and publisher actually cared about the reader. That's a huge plus.	2005-07-31
US	52512173	R31332STFG37R2	0399531580	562224460	Are You Crazy?: 18 Scientific Quizzes to Test Yourself	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Helpful Reality Check	Having read and reviewed Williams' previous book, \\"How Do You Compare?,\\" I was excited to discover this author had written another self-examination guide. While the world is just seething with insanity, our natural tendency is to have a \\"I'm OK, you are crazy\\" view of things. Some people are not as crazy as we think they are, we are not necessarily as sane as we think we are, and some of the quirks we are embarrassed about are not as whacky as we think. <br /> <br />An honest reader of \\"Are You Crazy?\\" will get a helpful reality check. For most of us, reading the text and doing the self-tests will help us affirm that we are OK after all. Probably for many more of us, this book will help us be more accepting of other people and their behavior. And for some, this book will be a lifeline--by identifying that something is wrong after all. Of course, the value of the tests rests squarely on the honesty of the person taking them. Those who are in denial probably need more help than this book can provide. But for most folks, it will prove to be a very good use of their time. <br /> <br />\\"Are You Crazy?\\" does include some Anglo-Saxon vernacular, which some folks may find offensive. But for those who \\"venture outside the monastery,\\" the language is descriptive and appropriate. <br /> <br />What is in \\"Are You Crazy?\\"? This book consists of eight chapters. The first chapter focuses on the reader--with tests on narcissism, negativity, and shyness. The second chapter focuses on the reader's relationships with others--with tests on security, jealousy, and manipulative behavior. <br /> <br />The third chapter focuses on eating and drinking disorders. Interestingly, eating and drinking disorders are \\"normal\\" in the USA (which is why we have an obesity epidemic and a diabetes epidemic). People without these disorders are actually oddballs! The drinking disorder part is referring to alcohol only, not to other beverages. So, for example, if you drink \\"osteoporosis in a can,\\" this book won't identify that as crazy behavior--even though it is. Nor does it go to the very core of the dieting vs. eating right \\"debate.\\" But it does touch on that. <br /> <br />The next four chapters delve into darker areas. These include se*ual peccadilloes, phobias, weird stuff, and really weird stuff. <br /> <br />The book closes by wrapping all of this up in Chapter Eight. Now that you've looked at all of these things, what do they mean? What is the big picture, and how does it relate to you? <br />If you want to break out of self-defeating delusion--what I think of as being perpetually asleep--(you may not even be aware you are in it) add this book to your collection. The movie \\"The Matrix\\" was a big hit, primarily because it reflected the fact our world as we perceive it is not at all our world as it is. And that is very dangerous. I think most people are actually scared of the truth, because with truth comes responsibility. But no ostrich has ever escaped the hunter by sticking its head in the sand. <br /> <br />You may have heard the expression, \\"The truth shall set you free.\\" If you believe that expression has any validity, then this book is a \\"must read\\" for you. If, on the other hand, you don't mind sand in your ears--then you should probably buy this book only as a gift to someone else. <br /> <br />A note on style and composition: Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE)--with only a few grammatical gaffes here and there. In an age where most \\"authors\\" seem oblivious to basic writing, this book stands out as one where the author actually cares about communicating to the reader. Given the subject matter, Williams'consideration for the reader is a crucial plus.	2005-07-16
US	52512173	R1L0EZRN7K6SUX	0195163435	470847742	The Man Behind the Microchip: Robert Noyce and the Invention of Silicon Valley	Books	5	66	69	N	N	Great story, great lessons, great man	Reviewer: Mark Lamendola, Senior IEEE member, IEEE Region 5 Outstanding Member, and recipient of multiple IEEE awards. <br /> <br />This review is a departure from my typical \\"book report\\" style, because I have too many things to say about it for that format to work. <br /> <br />Isaac Asimov called the invention of integrated circuit (IC) \\"the most important moment since man emerged as a life form.\\" If you look at how ICs have changed the world, that's a hard viewpoint to argue against. <br /> <br />I personally own quite a few ICs and you probably do also. They are everywhere. If you own a cell phone, a computer, or an automobile, you own at least several million transistors. Transistors inside ICs have made possible many things that were not even imagined 100 years ago. Think about all of today's communications, conveniences, explorations, exchanges, transportation, information processing, productivity, and advances in medicine. None of this would exist, if not for Dr. Bob Noyce. <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine that the drive, intelligence, and unique personality of one man could have had so much influence on bringing this about. But, it did. The IC changed the macro culture--even our brains are wired differently because of microelectronics (see [...] It also created a micro culture we call Silicon Valley--a major engine for economic and scientific growth. The change brought about by Dr. Noyce was deep and lasting. <br /> <br />This book is the story of that change and of the man behind it. But if Dr. Noyce, who died in 1990, were here today, he would make it clear that every invention depends on the breakthroughs that came before it. So in The Man Behind the Microchip, you read not just about Dr. Noyce, but about the people whom he motivated and inspired. <br /> <br />The Man Behind the Microchip offers at least seven things to the reader: <br /> <br />1. A great story. I like stories where the hero faces tough odds, falls, gets back up, and prevails over oneobstacle after another until he finally wins. That was the real story of Bob Noyce. He didn't come from privilege, and he didn't have instant success. He was human, and Berlin portrays him that way. Like all humans, he didn't succeed at everything he tried. Sometimes, his failures were enough to stop any ordinary man. But Dr. Noyce was no ordinary man. And therein lies the story. <br /> <br />2. Inspiration. Have you ever watched somebody do something much more difficult than what you are faced with? Didn't that make you feel like you could tackle your challenge and beat it? \\"Gosh, if he can do that, then I can do this.\\" Understanding the heights of Dr. Noyce's super-extraordinary accomplishments is enough to inspire anyone to accomplish the extraordinary.  <br /> <br />3. History. When we lose our history, we lose our knowledge of who we are. So, the history is important. It deepens both our understanding and our appreciation for the way things are. <br /> <br />4. Good writing. As an American who grew up in the United States, I often wonder if the people who write most of the books for today's market read much or ever got a passing grade in an English class. Language is a social contract that facilitates the exchange of ideas. Unlike many of today's \\"writers,\\" Leslie Berlin honors that contract. But beyond simply getting the mechanics right, Berlin knows how to turn a phrase and how to convey ideas in a clear and compelling way. <br /> <br />5. Insight. One of the traits we engineers are known for is we don't just lead a horse to water. We tend to dunk its head in the water. We mean well, but the poor horse thinks we're trying to drown it rather than slake its thirst. Not all engineers are this way, of course, and it's not just engineers who do this. Dr. Noyce set a good example for all of us dunkers to follow. By reading how he handled things, I learned something. And it wasn't something trivial. <br /> <br />6. A lesson in humility. It's easy to look at your ownaccomplishments or credentials, and let your head get big. I remember judging applications for IEEE Senior Membership, in 2003. I was sitting next to Rick Bush, who is a long-time mentor of mine. I am not alone in being in in awe of Rick (there aren't many people who get an \\"awe\\" rating from me). But even Rick was bowled over by what we were reading. We were sitting in judgment of people with multiple doctorates, dozens of patents, and work accomplishments that seemed surreal. I put my thumb and forefinger together and told Rick, \\"I feel this big.\\" He said, \\"Me, too.\\" Reading about Dr. Noyce (again) brought out that same feeling. <br /> <br />7. A lesson in greatness. Though Noyce's larger than life self--all which was just as Berlin described--humbled me, it also elevated me. Noyce lived a life that said no individual should think he is great on his own, but that every individual can be great by respecting others and bringing out the greatness in them. (Rick does this, too). <br /> <br />While reviewing this book, I exchanged e-mails with Dick Hodgman (not to be confused with Dick Hodgson, who is in the book). Hodgman is another IEEE Senior member whom I hold in awe. He worked at Intel when Noyce was there, and they spoke many times. Dick helped me get some thoughts together for this review. <br />Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance and on form. This book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE). This was a refreshing change from the Pidgin English that so many of today's authors slop onto our reading palettes. The care taken in writing this book shows that the author and publisher actually cared about the reader. That's a huge plus. <br /> <br />Warren Buffet, who \\"does not give endorsements,\\" endorsed this book. After reading it, I can see why. <br /> <br />If you have any interest in history, human drama, or the genesis of Silicon Valley, this book is a must read. I don't say that just becauseI'm active in the IEEE and Bob Noyce was \\"one of our own.\\" I say that because you would not be reading this review--or anything else--online if not for Dr. Noyce. Nor would there be an Amazon.com, cell phones, or any of the thousands of other wonderful things that we take for granted today. <br /> <br />Don't you want to know how it all came about?

US	52512173	R1JZOZ8FTIDWYB	0975966006	998929512	The Astute Investor	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Worth digging into	I'm also an engineer and MBA, as is the author.    Dr. Prentis has obviously done his research, and he has compiled an investing guide that addresses investing from a multi-faceted perspective.    Unlike many investment book authors, Prentis starts out by telling you he doesn't have a fool-proof method of flawlessly investing in the stock market. What he does offer is a distillation of the collective wisdom on the subject of investing. He brings this to the reader in twelve chapters, a conclusion, and an extensive glossary. The book contains many graphs, and it provides the addresses of relevant Websites.    Chapter One describes the seven principles of investing and delves into investment strategies. Chapter Two goes into theory and practice. The next two chapters discuss bonds, then stocks (respectively). Chapter Five talks about the psychology of trading. This chapter will help you understand the philosophy of technical traders (people who chart and predict stock prices, with no consideration of the company behind the stock). Prentis makes it clear that such trading is not long-term investing.    Chapters Six and Seven get very mathematical, as Prentis walks us through determining the value of an investment. If you don't know the difference between intrinsic, market, and bargain values, then you're not from the Warren Buffet school of investing. Chapter Eight explains the forces that drive the markets, and how unexpected news and expected news affect stock prices. Chapter Nine explains the viewpoint of the contrarian investor, who can succeed only through extraordinary courage of conviction.    All of the preceding chapters build up to Chapter Ten. It's here that Prentis gives his ten-step method for investing. He actually walks you through an example, so be prepared to do some work if you want to understand this method.    As an electrical engineer, I realize all systems are complex and consist of counterbalancing forces. Prentis, an industrial engineer, understands this also. Which is why he doesn't trot out a simple formula or say he's found the magic bullet. Instead, he lays out a methodology that will work if you work at it.    On the downside, The Astute Investor is badly in need of editing. The many grammar gaffes, spelling errors, syntax errors, and other deviations from Standard Written English (SWE) at times make the book hard to read. And the author's ultra-heavy use of passive voice sometimes makes reading the text feel like you're chewing gum that's still wrapped in aluminum foil. The chapter introductions and summaries are especially annoying in this regard.    Form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance, with one notable exception. The author used the Atkins Diet as an example of something good. That diet induces ketosis, creates nutrient deficiencies, greatly raises the risk of prostate and bowel cancer, destroys healthy tissue (such as bone and muscle), and poses a high risk of permanent damage to the kidneys and liver. What's to like? Further, the vast majority of people who abuse their bodies with this misguided, unsound, dangerous, and damaging diet are fatter a year later than if they'd never done it (see the Diets Exposed articles at [...]).    This book contains valuable information (except for the item just noted) in a logical structure. A second printing would be good for all concerned--but not until the author retains a copyeditor to correct the spelling, grammar, and punctuation--the quality of the text simply is not in synch with the quality of the information being conveyed. He also needs an editor to reword those intros and summaries to conform to any of the major style guides now in use. Presently, they detract from the book rather than add to it.    If you are a dedicated investor who wants to do well in the stock market, you should expend the effort to decipher the text. Is it worth the effort, when other investment books don't have thewriting defects? That's like asking if delicious, nutritious walnuts are worth taking out of the shell.	2005-06-29
US	52512173	R3BJYTRHY6DHHJ	0793188601	600924621	Strategies That Win Sales: Best Practices of the World's Leading Organizations	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	ASales Book That Has No Hype!	Today's selling environment is more complex than ever. This complexity presents problems and opportunities. How to best overcome the problems and take advantage of the opportunities is the message of Strategies That Win Sales. <br /> <br />This book is based on a survey of 150 individuals from 17 top companies. It's an inside look at what customers want and what high-performance sales organizations are doing. <br /> <br />Strategies That Win Sales consists of ten chapters and three appendices. Appendix A, \\"Five Roles for Successful Sales\\" is a worthwhile read on its own. The introduction explains the methodology of the survey, and how it relates to the content of the book. The first chapter details the challenges facing today's sales force. These include excessive price pressure, more competition (we're global, now), more sales channels (often competing with each other), and even better-informed customers who make more demands. <br /> <br />The result of the research behind Strategies That Win Sales was the identification of seven strategic areas that leading sales organizations use to win sales. One of the most interesting of these areas is consultative selling (Chapter Five). That kind of selling is not a \\"one size fits all\\" solution. If you can identify the customers with whom that approach works, your sales can benefit. But applying it to the wrong customers can hurt sales. <br /> <br />Strategies That Win Sales doesn't provide any \\"magic bullets\\" or neat gimmicks an incompetent salesperson can apply to become an overnight success. Nor does it provide any five-step solutions for sales managers needing to turn an underperforming sales team into superstars. This book is low on hyperbole, and heavy on real information. (Actually, it has no hyperbole). <br /> <br />One thing today's successful sales practitioner has in common with the sales champ of yesteryear is hard work. Another is the ability to listen to the customer. That much hasn't changed, and probably never will. But, the devil is in the details, and this book goes over them thoroughly. <br /> <br />On the downside, Strategies That Win Sales is following a recent trend of insufficient editing. The many grammar gaffes in Strategies That Win Sales occasionally hide the meaning the authors had intended. In some cases, I was unable to determine the meaning at all. This book contains valuable information, and a second printing would be good for all concerned--but not until the authors (or publisher) retain a copyeditor to make the text conform to Standard Written English (SWE). <br /> <br />Strategies That Win Sales also contained an odd language convention--I have no idea why. The authors used the word \\"impact\\" in odd places, turning some sentences into farsical gibberish. Impact means \\"to force tightly together.\\" This is why we say teeth are \\"impacted\\" and why a doctor prescribes laxatives if your diagnosis is that you are \\"impacted.\\" I fail to see the value of planning to \\"impact customers,\\" though the authors talk about this repeatedly. I can't imagine any sales person going around and \\"impacting customers\\" without getting arrested rather quickly. Sales has changed, but not THAT much!	2005-06-26
US	52512173	R18RFFBDNN8DOI	1587991594	522836433	The Washing Machine: How Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Soils Us	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Clean up your views on terrorist funding	The Washing Machine takes you inside the extremely convoluted world of shady financial deals and shell games with money--commonly known as money laundering--on an international scale. Kochan provides dozens of case histories, and explains how each of them worked. He also explains, in detail, how particular operations funded particular terrorist groups, who did what, and how they got caught. <br /> <br />Kochan doesn't just make the case that big money laundering operations finance terrorism and let it go at that. He also shows the deleterious effects on national economies. Nor does he simply talk about money per se. He provides the full picture of how terrorists use everything from diamonds to cigarettes to fund their operations. Kochan also explains what law enforcement agencies, banks, and other concerned parties are doing to crack down on the fraud, corruption, and theft that are part and parcel of the money laundering problem. <br /> <br />He even touches on corruption and complicity within government agencies. In the United States, this is an enormous problem (and well-documented)--though Kochan doesn't go there. <br /> <br />He does provide us with a useful glossary and an impressive bibliography. The fact this book is very well researched becomes evident shortly after cracking the cover. You probably have an opinion about September 11, the Bush administration, the Iraqi War, the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act, and several other of today's issues. If you want an informed opinion--rather than just an opinion--on these issues, you need the information contained in this book. You may not change your viewpoint, but you will at least have a viewpoint built on something other than political ether. <br /> <br />Now, did you notice I did not write \\"Patriot Act\\" in the preceding paragraph? Before reading this book, I would have. I didn't know that the name of the act is an acronym (and most people don't know an acronym must, by definition, spell a word--it isn't just a mnemonic orabbreviation) for Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Interrupt and Obstruct Terrorism.\\" If you already knew that, great. You'll find plenty of other things to learn in this book. <br /> <br />Where this book falls down is its writing quality. The mangled syntax and incorrect punctuation render some parts of it incomprehensible and others just hard to read. If Kochan is planning a second printing, he should first have a good copyeditor has correct the huge number of mechanical errors in the text. Standard Written English (SWE) and style guides exist for a reason. <br /> <br />So, it's an effort to read this book because of editorial sloppiness. However, the research is thorough and the information is eye-popping. Sometimes, you have to work a little harder for some things--but the payoff is worthwhile. The understanding you can obtain from this book is one of those things.	2005-06-19
US	52512173	R2RXA8JMGB110X	1401300030	78737937	The Pirate Coast: Thomas Jefferson, the First Marines, and the Secret Mission of 1805	Books	5	150	167	N	N	The gold standard for historical accounts	Some people like suspense novels, some people like action adventure stories, and some people are real history buffs. This book will satisfy all three crowds. To find accurate history written in such an engaging, page-turning manner is a rare delight. <br /> <br />The United States became a nation at a time when the Barbary States (Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers) were enjoying a piracy trade they had been running for three centuries. This robbery took place by forcefully taking a ship on the high seas, then keeping the goods and enslaving the crew and passengers. The pirates would hold prisoners for ransom--typically for a year, while they negotiated a price--then release them when paid. No country would stand up to these pirates. In fact, other nations paid tribute to them to avert even worse problems. <br /> <br />This cowardly state of affairs would have continued for centuries more, had not William Eaton headed up a mission to end the reign of one of the bashaws (a bashaw is a sort of king).  <br /> <br />This particular bashaw (Yussef) killed his oldest brother, who had been the rightful heir to the throne. Then, he took the middle brother's family hostage and sent him into exile--leaving Yussef the one occupying the throne. The middle brother, Hamet, wanted to regain his throne from his sadistic and unscrupulous younger brother. This is where William Eaton came in. <br /> <br />To understand the central story, you have to understand Eaton. Zacks helps us do this, by showing Eaton engaging in the failures that brought him to the point where his adventure with Hamet began. Eaton had a sound military mind, but he was lousy at politics. He was constantly shooting himself in the proverbial foot, and his enemies took pains to make him suffer. <br /> <br />Eaton's adventure with Hamet is the central story of this book. How that adventure begins, stumbles, picks up, and goes through a multitude of setbacks and political machinations is fascinating. How it ends is disheartening, because that ending shows the triumph of petty politics over common sense. <br />This book allows the reader to see into historical events and the people behind them. For example: <br /> <br />We see the pompous Tobias Lear--a long-time personal friend of George Washington who damaged that relationship by stealing rent money he was allegedly collecting for Washington--truly bungle negotiations in a way that makes you think of Jimmy Carter. He was that bad. <br /> <br />We see the incompetent Captain William Bainbridge surrender the USS Philadelphia, when there was no reason to do so. This act of stupidity wasn't his first surrender. But, this one got his whole crew enslaved (and some killed) and tortured for over a year. Officers, of course, were pampered by their hosts (only the enlisted men were barbarized). Amazingly, the Navy gave him command of yet another ship. I guess three's a charm? <br /> <br />We see Thomas Jefferson get an object lesson in why a gunboat navy doesn't work and why a navy needs massive ships. Jefferson was a complex character and a skillful political manipulator. Zacks shows the man at his scheming best, while also reminding us of Jefferson's many significant contributions. A balanced portrayal like this rarely occurs in accounts of major historical figures. <br /> <br />Today, we think of the US Marines as an elite force--the few and the proud. They are often the first into battle. But at the start of Eaton's adventure, they were not highly thought of. Their pay was less than that of a regular sailor, and their main job was to serve as a sort of police force for the ship they were assigned to. <br /> <br />But Eaton took a force of Marines into battle and made history. Eaton's Marines did what Marines have done ever since--the impossible. <br /> <br />Throughout this book, you can't help but share Eaton's sense of frustration as he faces one obstacle after another. Because the dialogue and narration are so alive, you experience his joys, his anger, his pride, and his worry. Zacks does an excellent job of bringing those emotions forth. But Zack stays true to history and doesn't let our view of Eaton be one-sided. He also shows, throughout the book, how Eaton's various weaknesses work against him. One weakness is his inability to stay out of debt. Another is his inability to garner mutual respect with those in authority over him. <br /> <br />But the weakness that does him in is his inability to let go. Eaton's mission ends, his obsession with Lear's incompetent bungling and Jefferson's complicity in undermining Eaton's mission gnaw at him. He lets his unhappiness drive him to drink. And in 1811, he finally drinks himself into his grave at the age of 47. Five years later, Tobias Lear--Eaton's most hated enemy--takes his own life. <br /> <br />Eaton's mission was the first covert operation conducted overseas by the United States. He did not accomplish what he set out to do, because of undermining from other people--most notably Lear and Jefferson. But in the year following Eaton's death, Stephen Decatur, Jr., commanded a Naval force that proceed to kick a-- and gravely weaken the pirate nations. <br />Decatur's actions stopped the Barbary Pirates from attacking US ships. But, those actions also emboldened other victim nations to fight back. <br /> <br />In 1829, two French brigates ran aground in the harbor in Algiers. The Dey (ruler) of Algiers had 109 officers and crew members beheaded. That action resulted in a massive French force descending upon Algiers. The French forced a surrender in three weeks, and took complete control of the country. France did not grant independence to Algiers until 1962, which is why French is a common language in Algiers even today. <br /> <br />The French also took control of Tunis in 1881, granting them independence in 1956. Tripoli did not come out of this unscathed. We are all familiar with this portion of The Marine Hymn: \\"From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli.\\" Read this book to find out why US Marines still sing those words today. Or, read it simply for the pleasure of reading a good book.	2005-06-15
US	52512173	R17D919F9WWYJL	0374281947	375817200	Personal Injuries (Scott Turow)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Fiction that doesn't cheat the reader	This was the first time I'd read a novel by Turow. I had read his non-fiction work before, and was impressed. Now I understand how me made his non-fiction so compelling--he's a solid writer who understands, and deftly uses, the elements of fiction. <br /> <br />Turow writes as though he's never heard of formula books, one-dimensional characters, ghosts in the machine, or the other slop that characterizes so much of today's fiction (and non-fiction, for that matter). <br /> <br />I like a good plot, and Turow surely delivered on that score by giving this novel several twists that kept the story moving at a fast pace. The various plot nuances were delightful. <br /> <br />I like Tom Clancy novels because the technical detail is excellent--Turow delivers in that department, as well. I made a point of checking his credits at the end of the book, just because he kept getting these things right. <br /> <br />When an author fails to get these things right, you end up with things like The DaVinci Code, which leave any informed reader feeling cheated and lied to. Even many purported non-fiction works, such as Kurzweil's \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" are filled with disinformation that ruins the book for any reader who has had enough interest in the subject to have read about it already. <br /> <br />When an author takes the approach of a Clancy or Turow and presents a novel that is well-researched, the reader gets a triple bonus when that novel also exhibits tight writing and a gripping plot. <br /> <br />But what most sets this book apart is the complex way the characters interact--turning that triple bonus into a quadruple bonus. We follow Robbie Feaver throughout the story, initially seeing him as an opportunistic lawyer who uses the system to cheat. We then see him as a coward who rats out on his friends. <br /> <br />But as the book progresses, we see those initial impressions are just part of his facade and that deep down his sole motivation is to protect the people he loves. The way he deceives various other characters initially gives you the impression he's a master at deception--until we see other deceptions that fool even him. He's the perfect character for the multi-layered plot.  <br /> <br />The story seems to be about Feaver--yet when you finish the book, you have to wonder if that was the case at all. <br /> <br />Maybe the story was about another character, a female FBI agent assigned to stick to Feaver like glue and watch his every move. Evon Miller is as complex as Robbie, and we find that she--like Robbie-- is full of secrets that make this book a powerful story. A half-dozen other characters bring their own star power to the story, and each of them provides at least one  surprise. <br /> <br />An interesting thing about this book is it brings up several moral and legal issues, without ever preaching to the reader or having the characters \\"do the right thing.\\" Instead, the characters react to those issues in their own way--thus creating much of the page-turning tension this book provides.	2005-06-04

This book is a \\"must read.\\" On the downside, the author is a bit wordy at times. But at other times, his writing simply sparkles. This book provides useful information, compelling case histories, and thought-inspiring statements. <br /> <br />What's most valuable about this book is its message. Just prior to writing this review, I exchanged e-mails with a business-person who provided several accounts of customers and suppliers who are petty, rude, and selfish. Such behavior seems to be \\"normal,\\" these days. We need look only to accounts of road rage and powerful government bureaucrats to support the contention that people are, well, contentious. <br /> <br />But, is this the way humans are headed? Or is there something else developing for us? And what about you, personally? How can you create greater levels of kindness in the world around you? Barasch provides solid insights into this, backed by extensive information that includes clinical research. <br /> <br />This isn't another of those \\"follow this simple formula\\" books written just to provide additional income for a motivational speaker. Far from it (Barasch isn't a motivational speaker, for one thing). Though highly credentialed to write a book that leads you to contemplate your world view, Barasch doesn't claim to have the magic answers. Instead, he takes various aspects of compassion (devoting a chapter to each) and supplies some amazing case histories that provide lessons for all of us. <br /> <br />A particularly moving case history involves the father of a murdered 43-year old woman--and her killer. You might expect a parent to completely hate the murderer of his child. And, that was this father's first reaction. But hatred is a hot coal that burns those who hold it. This father, instead, extended love to the murderer. The results of that serve as a living legacy to the murdered daughter. She had devoted her life to helping others, and now--through the man who murdered her--this woman's father is workingminor miracles in the lives of many prisoners. <br /> <br />Another example is a camp for teenagers. But, not just any teenagers--this is a camp that brings Israeli and Palestinian teens together. You can imagine the difficulties there--kids from two cultures that each demonize and hate the other to the point where people strap bombs on their bodies to blow up \\"the enemy.\\" Yet, the people who run the camp program were able to make some surprising breakthroughs. This story alone justifies the book, but there's more. <br /> <br />A constant theme throughout the book is we have the power to choose to love--or to hate. We aren't trapped into one or the other, unless we let ourselves be trapped. But many of us are trapped, and we're trapped in a room constructed of something negative, such as pettiness or hatred. We're trapped because we simply cannot find the door. Fortunately, Barasch has some great ideas to help us not only see that door, but to throw it wide open.	2005-05-02

The first thing that struck me about this book is how well-written it is. I am a writer with about 5,000 articles in print or online. I'm also an editor, and I am noted for my harsh evaluations of the writing of others--most people simply do not write well.<br /><br />Reza Aslan writes well. Extremely well.<br /><br />By the time I was into the second page of this book, I felt that if Aslan had written a book about navel lint--I would still want to read it.<br /><br />Couple the excellent writing with quality content, and you have a captivating book. When the subject is an authoritative explanation of Islam, the book becomes a must read for two groups of people: Those who are Muslims, and those who are not.<br /><br />Aslan takes us on a journey through time. We see Muhammad before he becomes the \\"messenger of God,\\" and we see his struggles along the way. From this, you can understand how Islam got its start. And then we see the various forces that act upon Islam as a blacksmith's hammer acts upon hot metal, and we watch this religion take shape over centuries.<br /><br />Today, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world. But, it's also a sharply fragmented religion. Aslan explain the origins of the various factions shaping Islam today. There's a strong parallel to what happened in Christianity. And, Aslan draws on this parallel to explain a core concept of the book--that Islam is far from monolithic. You have to remember that Christianity got a 500 year head start on Islam. Read your history of the West, and you can see Islam along the same trajectory.<br /><br />Americans, in the aftershock of September 11, generally felt much of the Islamic world had declared war on the West. In actuality, the war is between Islamic factions--just as there were wars between Christian factions five hundred years ago (and still are, today). The West is, to many of the warring factions, a symbol of power. An attack on the West is a way to demonstrate power to the other factions. Of course, there's also a hatred of the West--but that hatred isn't the core driver it's made out to be.<br /><br />Yet, that hatred is a powerful force in itself. Contrary to what many liberals have been spewing, this hatred did not arise from recent actions of any American political leader. Aslan destroys that bit of proganda by addressing the history of colonization--the enslavement, displacement, and impoverishment of millions of Islamic people.<br /><br />What about this interfaction rivalry? Islam is beset by three major philosophies. One philosophy seeks to keep the original vision of Islam pure--that is, to not deviate from the teachings of Muhammad. A second philosophy is that Muhammad was not pure enough, and so Islam must become more radical (think of the Taliban, here). The third philosophy is that Islam must change to adapt to the modern world--it must throw off the chains of ignorance and poverty. Aslan explains the thinking behind each of these philosophies, without preaching to the reader.<br /><br />Aslan's views come into play at the end of the book, where he ties everything together. But, you don't get the feeling this is the author trying to convince you of his own views. By this point, the reader already trusts Aslan and sees him as an expert. Now, the reader gets the expert's viewpoint on where Islam should head and why.<br /><br />The book carries the reader through many spiritually dark places, but emerges into the sunshine of hope. The end is inspiring and encouraging, and it carries a message for people of all religions. It is a message well worth taking to heart.other factions.

A sizeable number of today's teens are so frustrated--like rats who get shocked no matter what part of the cage floor they step on--that they just give up on themselves. They \\"can't do anything right\\" or can't be perfect (as demanded by parents or others), so they give up.  <br /> <br />Their situation is like that of a wage earner caught in the machinery of the IRS: a culture of punitive attitudes supersedes practical considerations, common sense, and even basic human decency. In such a situation, the only possible outcome is destruction. And it's this culture that many teens must deal with. Because of the intense frustration, they grow apathetic. A resigned \\"whatever, dude\\" becomes the new mantra. <br /> <br />The key to motivating people is the same as the key to having a good relationship with anybody: treating that person with dignity and respect. Yet, we find a total absence of dignity or respect in the way many parents treat their children. Elliott Currie brings us one chilling account after another of troubled teens. In these accounts, we can see it's not a \\"lack of toughness\\" or a \\"life of privilege\\" that drives kids into drug abuse and other self-destructive behaviors. It's a lack of respect and dignity. The cure parents and social workers normally offer for this is often disrespect and humiliation. <br /> <br />The social (governmental) institutions that our hard-earned tax dollars support tend to compound the problems, with the attitude that the teen is the problem and/or the problem is within the teen. The philosophy is that if the teen can would correct his/her own behavior, everyone can be happy. These people don't realize a fundamental point upon which psychologists base talk therapy: self-destructive behaviors are often coping behaviors.  <br /> <br />Until you correct the environment a teen is in, the teen is not going to successfully correct his/her behavior. This, also, comes out clearly in accounts Curriebrings the reader. <br /> <br />Another attitude that comes out is that all sins are equal. So, a kid gets into minor trouble--perhaps a string of things. A bad grade, sassing to a parent, staying out later than agreed upon, forgetting a chore--and suddenly, this teen crosses the line from human to evil incarnate. There's often little distinction between typical teen problems and real problems. I went through this myself, as a teen. I had long hair, and my dad wanted to throw me out of the house. Forget that I had straight As, held a job, was active socially and in church, and was an athlete in school. Of course, I could have simply cut my hair--but, I needed to make a statement and that was my statement. Both of us were stubborn. We resolved our problem--but many kids and parents don't. <br /> <br />Sometimes when parents encounter one small thing they \\"can't abide,\\" the kid is \\"no good.\\" Or, they get frustrated over many minor things and see their child as \\"lost.\\" They forget their kid isn't out selling drugs or robbing liquor stores. This myopia is prevalent, and it's causing massive destruction. This is what Currie shows us in account after account. <br /> <br />The book does contain a couple of odd threads. One is Currie's negative remarks about the Reagan era. He doesn't make clear what part of ending Jimmy Carter's malaise, producing the longest peacetime economic expansion in history, ending the Soviet nuclear threat, or massively increasing job opportunities he objects to. Another is he proposes that we entrust our healthcare system to the same \\"geniuses\\" who use our hard-earned tax dollars to purchase $750 toilet seats and $900 hammers--he wasn't clear on how this would benefit teens or anybody else. <br /> <br />But if you can set aside the minor sprinkling of outdated left-wing politics, you will find this book is provocative and insightful--even helpful. If you have teens, you may find that reading this book to be one of the best uses you've ever madeof your time. If you have bought into the simplistic theories of \\"tough love,\\" \\"teen boot camps,\\" and other half-baked measures that humiliate teens instead of accord them respect and basic human dignity, then you are on a path to failure. Thinking through what the kids in this book have to say can help you go forward with your eyes open. <br /> <br />This book doesn't expound yet another behavioral theory. Instead, Currie looks at real situations and takes us inside the minds of the teens. He reminds us that teens are basically good. They are people with feelings. Teens are not equipped to handle the demands placed on adults, and that puts some responsibility on the shoulders of adults. Teens have their own needs and if we will simply listen to them and try to understand, then we have a good chance of providing teens with what they need to succeed.  <br /> <br />Understanding these few facts--on the part of parents, neighbors, friends, mentors, employers, teachers, and social workers can help--can help adults involved with teens do a remarkable turnaround. And help nearly any teen from becoming \\"troubled\\" in the first place.	2005-01-05

That's where you should have done something you could have done, and now regret never having done so. It's a consequence of wasting an opportunity. Sometimes, age shuts the door of opportunity permanently. It's just this kind of situation that Phil Keoghan will help you prevent. <br /> <br />This book goes beyond just giving you inspirational examples (such as the nun who, in her 70s, competes in triathlon events--and wins). The subtitle of this book is \\"8 Ways to Create a List for the Life You Want,\\" and the book delivers on that promise. <br />The first chapter does what first chapters are supposed to do--it explains the premise of the book. But, it starts with a frightening near-death diving experience--the one that launched Keoghan on his opportunity-making, opportunity-taking lifestyle. This chapter then goes on to chronicle Keoghan's own \\"List for Life\\" and how it evolved as he matured, in addition to getting the reader hooked on the idea of creating a \\"List for Life.\\" <br /> <br />Chapters 2 and 3 talk about getting rid of excuses (such as not having time or money) and facing your fear, respectively. This isn't rah-rah stuff, but practical advice. One particular account show this very clearly. Koeghan works with a woman who is scared of heights. She eventually rappels down the highest bridge in the USA--and wants more. Keoghan uses many interesting examples to illustrate his principles in action. <br /> <br />Chapters 4, 5, and 6 deal with getting lost in the moment, testing your limits, and taking a leap of faith (respectively). I group these together, because they address getting out of your comfort zone. Again, Keoghan uses many interesting examples to illustrate that he's not just spouting theory or \\"new age talk.\\" He's speaking from experience. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 gives perhaps the main reason for doing any of this in the first place--rediscovering your childhood.Keoghan has a way of making, enjoying, and sharing special moments. He also recognizes this ability in others--people like 89-year old skier Banana George. <br /> <br />Chapters 8 and 9 discuss shedding inhibitions and breaking new ground, respectively. Here, Keoghan talks about taking an honest look at self-imposed rules and limitations. Are those really helping you? Is there something better? Dare to explore. <br /> <br />Chapter 10 shows how rewarding it can be to help others realize their dreams, and it gives you practical advice on how to do so. It's rather motivating. Chapter 11 gives example after example of \\"Dreamers all around us\\"--folks who have broken through their own constraints and reached for new opportunities. The book ends with Chapter 12, which provides a methodology for getting from point A (where you are now) to point B (where you want to be). I think Keoghan took exceptional pains to make the line between those points short. <br /> <br />So if you want to be able to look back on your life and feel good that you lived it to the fullest, this book is a \\"must read.\\" It's inspirational, informative, and entertaining. Get one copy for yourself, and a second one for somebody you really care about.	2005-01-01
US	52512173	R2NWQA0TI3Y7YF	1418423491	114402022	What Not to Do When Seeking Employment	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Avoid the landmines	Job search books generally contain good advice on what to do to get a job. But, are you aware of the things not to do? This is where Jay B. Crawford brings his decades of experience as both a job seeker and a job placement expert to your rescue. <br /> <br />In this age of continual economic restructuring, job change is almost always inevitable and almost never voluntary. Job seekers diligently go about the process of finding a job, then wonder why they are still looking many months after they started. What went wrong? This is where people tend to remain clueless--and, consequently, jobless. Crawford tackles that problem head-on. <br /> <br />In the first chapter, he talks about his own career--one that would make a decent plot for a movie--and provides ample lessons that he summarizes with a listing of \\"Don'ts\\" at the end. He continues the pattern through each of the subsequent chapters, always summarizing the lessons learned with a list of \\"Don'ts\\" at the end of the chapter. <br /> <br />The next two chapters deal with the mindset you need to have and the pressures you face. The next two chapters discuss how to prepare for your job search and some options to explore while engaged in it. The next four chapters (6, 7, 8, and 9) get into the nitty gritty of conducting the search (cover letter and resume preparation, interviewing overview, telephone interviewing, and in-person interviewing, respectively). The tenth chapter addresses how to overcome a failing job campaign, and the eleventh chapter summarizes the book so you don't forget the most important concepts. <br /> <br />As Crawford relates his own experiences and the lessons learned therein, he frequently uses the experiene he's talking about as the basis for advice on how to keep the job you have. And it's pretty solid advice. <br /> <br />Crawford's style is that of a mentor. As I read this book, I felt like Jay Crawford was sitting across from me talking to me, with my best interests at heart. The text is crisp, entertaining, and energetic--all with a personal touch. Crawford strikes me as a man who doesn't speak unless he has something to say. And when he does say something, it's worth hearing. <br /> <br />If you're a wage-earner, this book should definitely be in your collection. But, I think it has more value than just that. If you are a parent, consider asking your child to read this book and talk with you about it (you could break that effort down into one chapter at a time, for younger children). You will both learn from that, plus have a meaningful exchange. And, your child will learn some valuable life lessons. <br /> <br />This book isn't about what tricks to perform to get an employer to hire you. It's about how to be a more desirable employee while conducting a job search, and how to avoid the common mistakes that could shut you out of the job you want.	2005-01-01

At first glance, I thought it was fiction. It wasn't. I had to keep reminding myself of this as I read. What a fascinating story! Imagine being tried for murder four times--for the same killing. That's what Jim Williams endured for nearly a decade--including eight years of prison until his final trial.<br /><br />The characters in this account of a landmark murder case are real, but most are so eccentric that they seem like actors in a Monty Python skit. Berendt caught all the colorful details for the reader. As usual in America, justice is hard to get. In Williams' case, his personal proclivities made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Savannah.<br /><br />The personalities include a black pre-op transexual drag queen (who later went on to become a minor celebrity), a young redneck testosterone-soaked bisexual gigolo (who was murdered), a voodoo priestess, a piano-playing con artist attorney who doesn't pay his bills, a glory-seeking political schemer, a grossly incompetent and dishonest District Attorney, and other people who aren't exactly normal.<br /><br />You can think of this book as a \\"true crime\\" story--with much of the crime actually being in the legal system. It's a riveting, and sometimes hilarious, page-turner. It takes you inside the various hidden agendas, secret attacks, oddball alliances, and crafty schemes that occupy the minds of people in a town where secrets are well-known and everyone knows everyone else's business.	2004-12-24

This beautiful book takes you on a guided tour of the geographical exploration of America. And it does that by showing and explaining over 300 of the maps explorers created while discovering North America. Many of these maps are richly detailed and visually stunning. The seven-page map catalog in the back of the book \\"sums up\\" these maps by providing the page on which the map appears, map name, map author, and source. Some of these are in vaults and not available for public viewing. <br /> <br />Hayes is a solid researcher and you can trust his work. That scored big points with me, because I've recently come across several books that present themselves as factual--when in reality they are poorly-researched and full of misinformation.  <br /> <br />Unlike some authors, Hayes honors his contract with the reader. <br /> <br />Hayes combines his solid research with a writing style that brings the subject to life, warts and all. The journey he takes you on starts in 1000 AD and continues to the present day. With Hayes as your guide, you follow the explorers as they discover North America and its wonders. These include the wide prairies, complicated coastal waterways, expansive rivers, and many mountains that make North America such a geographical treasure trove. <br /> <br />Hayes does a good job of arranging the maps by area and era. For example, he looks at the West and starts with maps from the earliest years of exploration and then proceeds to the most recent maps. Through Hayes' narrative, you see history unfold as though you are there watching the explorers themselves. We see their human side, which is sometimes self-defeating. Hayes uses a combination of objective observation and witty commentary to provide a tour that is both informative and entertaining. <br /> <br />The maps in this book reflect the knowledge and the ignorance of the times in which they were drawn. For example, the obsession with a \\"Northwest Passage\\" across the continent--a short trade route to China--caused many mapmakers to draw in waterways that weren't there. Other mapmakers would then copy and propagate the mythological features. <br /> <br />I found myself reading this book with my tabletop globe at my side. As Hayes discussed the various islands, bays, rivers, and other features, I wanted to know where each one was and how it fit into the overall map. I also found myself frequently comparing the explorers' maps to the globe and chuckling as Hayes revealed how this or that map differed from reality--and why. <br /> <br />Because I have an interest in geography, I would have been satisfied with just the maps and some brief explanatory text. And I think even someone not especially interested in geography would have found such a  book worth sitting down with for an afternoon if that's all it contained, because these maps are just so intriguing. But, there's more. Far more. <br /> <br />Yes, I've already said Hayes also explained other things. But, he didn't throw in a few \\"human interest\\" tidbits about the explorers. He told the story behind the story. The stories of the political machinations that drove many of these explorations would have made an interesting book in its own right. So, now the reader gets this great set of geography lessons while also enjoying the kinds of plot twists you might expect from a good novel. Great stuff! <br /> <br />Get this book for your tabletop, if you want something visually impressive for your visitors. Read this book, if you want a great read that leaves you with an impressive knowledge of the exploration of North America.	2004-12-09
US	52512173	R2LYW8AZKVRGEM	0974670111	954732328	Thank You, President Bush: Reflections on the War on Terror, Defense of the Family, and Revival of the Economy	Books	5	58	151	N	Y	An honest presentation of facts about #43	This collection of 24 essays is loaded with facts, figures, analysis, and history. Though this book came out before the 2004 election, I did not read or review it until after that election.<br /><br />This book is not an attack on liberals, it's not Bush marketing material, it's not groveling Bush worship, it's not fluff, and it's not hysterical. It's also not the product of the \\"mainstream media,\\" who are so out of touch with the rest of America that most of us now tune them out (e.g., television viewership by males 18 to 24 is nearly zero and it's dropping for all other viewership groups as well).<br /><br />Why should you read this book if you hate Bush? Because the reasons (I have heard) for hating Bush are based on misinformation, misunderstanding, and misquotations. They just don't hold up under honest analysis. It doesn't matter to me if you hate Bush. It does matter to me if you hate him based on false reasons. Now, your group conformity (feel free to look that phrase up) may be at work and the facts won't change your opinion. But, at least expose yourself to them.<br /><br />For example, we heard from Ted Kennedy about the President's \\"reckless\\" economic policies, in reference to Bush's aggressive tax cuts. Ted Kennedy's own brother, JFK, implemented aggressive tax cuts. And the result was a sustained economic boom (plus the Beatles moved to the USA--yes!). Read the book, and you'll understand why this worked then, why it worked under Reagan, and why it's working now. And so it goes with topic after topic. If you are going to criticize Bush, at least don't be as obtuse about it as Teddy Kennedy is. For him, of all people, to say that is beyond absurd.<br /><br />Why should you read this book if you are already a Bush supporter? Because you need to be an informed Bush supporter. If you support Bush because of group conformity, you are supporting him for the wrong reasons. His accomplishments are amazing, and you should support him because you understand whatthose accomplishments are and why they are so significant.<br /><br />This book does have some bias. Several of the contributors may be thought of as \\"right wing\\" folks. Their main characteristic that Libertarians would object to is they want to ban abortion. But not all of the contributors share this philosophy. The book takes viewpoints from people of widely varying backgrounds and viewpoints. Some are very academic, and will give you a solid analysis of economics, complete with numbers and tables. Others talk about the President's character. Others are foreign policy experts, and they talk about that. Keep in mind that this is not a collection of propaganda from \\"Bushies.\\" The experts who support Bush do so for reasons they explain in their essays.<br /><br />And, of course, you'd expect some bias in the heartwarming introduction by Jeb Bush. That introduction, however, stays within the constraints of what you might expect one brother to say about another. Jeb Bush speaks as a brother, not as a person pretending to be an unbiased expert.<br /><br />While I have used the word \\"bias\\" to describe some of the viewpoints, let me make it clear that I could not find one instance of misrepresentation. Honesty is an over-riding characteristic of this book. It presents viewpoints of experts, backed by verifiable facts and figures rather than scare tactics and speculation. Granted, these viewpoints are all from one side--there is not a \\"point - counterpoint\\" tone to this book. With all the Bush-bashing books in circulation, that just wasn't necessary. This book seeks to balance the imbalance by providing \\"the other side\\" to the shrill--and usually baseless--criticisms made by other books.<br /><br />The book does a good job of staying out of the brainwashing business. It's a collection of essays produced not for this book, but for other purposes. The essays are merely assembled without any attempt to \\"interpret them\\" to the reader. You can thus read the part \\"between the ends\\" and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />The ends I speak of are the introduction and the concluding chapter (plus the publisher's note). The author and publisher do make a point of summing up the presented material saying what they think it all means. You should read the essays and analysis in this book before saying whether you agree or disagree.<br /><br />Being torn between keeping this impressive book as a reference and passing it along to others as a beacon of truth in our current haze of disinformation, I've decided I'll have to buy a second copy. That's what I hate about well-researched books--you can't get by with just one copy.	2004-11-30

The story was vividly entertaining. Too bad, however, it fell far short of its promise to be a great book. <br /> <br />In the prologue of the book, Dan Brown (the author) stated that all of the historical facts presented by the characters in the book were true. Then, Brown seemingly goes on a campaign to test the naivet and ignorance of his readers. I found this insulting, and it detracted from my enjoyment of the book. <br /> <br />This is where Ehrman's book comes in. As someone who's read previous work by Ehrman, I was curious to see what he had to say. I was hoping Ehrman would once again provide his rock-solid analysis, rather than be one of the shrill voices we readers contend with so often. I was not disappointed: Ehrman delivered. <br /> <br />As I read The Da Vinci Code, a question began to gnaw at me. Was Brown merely playing a prank by stating several historical \\"facts\\" a reasonably well-read person would know to be false, or was there more to it than that? <br /> <br />Ehrman answered that question in his own admirable way--and he presented much more answer than I expected. It was, in classic Ehrman style, a complete answer that leaves no doubt. The key to that answer is in another book--one that The Da Vinci Code draws heavily from. <br /> <br />When you read an Ehrman piece, you have to understand something about this author. What he writes is devoid of personal opinion. He writes with authority. He backs everything he says--with logic and the actual evidence. Ehrman is the consummate scholar, whose only interest is the truth. He has no axe to grind with Dan Brown, and he makes that clear--he's recommended The Da Vinci Code to others. And, he stays within his scope of expertise (something else other authors would do well to emulate). He doesn't analyze the whole book, doesn't go into a religious rant, doesn't defend or advocate any particular viewpoint, doesn't  and doesn't get emotional. He simply writes what is. And he does so in a clear and compelling manner. <br /> <br />In this book, Ehrman counters the \\"facts\\" Dan Brown's characters gave us on Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine. But, he doesn't throw a laundry list of errors at the reader. Instead, Ehrman first explains how historians look at information sources and how they determine which ones are accurate. He fully explains the methodology, so you--as the reader--can follow along and draw your own conclusions as the evidence is presented. And then he walks you through the various statements presented as \\"fact\\" by the characters in the book. I found it a rather pleasant walk, myself. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to read The Da Vinci Code, if you like a well-crafted thriller. But, keep in mind that Dan Brown is no Tom Clancy or James Michener. Consequently, this is not an historical novel (a novel that correctly conveys historical fact). Rather, it is completely a work of fiction. It's great for entertainment, but not for education. If you do read it, get a \\"knowledge correction\\" afterwards, courtesy of Bart D. Ehrman. <br />	2004-11-28
US	52512173	RSRA5MVV53VHQ	1594860068	159484493	Trace Your Roots with DNA: Using Genetic Tests to Explore Your Family Tree	Books	5	110	114	N	N	Genetic Research and Genealogy Converge	This book explores the convergence of genetic research and genealogy, and provides its own convergence of the academic with the practical. <br /> <br />Some people make a life's work of tracing their family roots. I'm not one of those people. But a few years ago, my sister researched our family's immigration on the paternal side and found the account we'd been told our whole lives simply wasn't true. So when I saw this book, I thought it might be interesting. That's exactly what it turned out to be--in spades. <br /> <br />The authors took care to make the book readable to both novices and experienced genealogical researchers. As I have no experience in genealogy, I very much appreciated Part I. It gave me a good background, so I could understand and enjoy the rest of the book. Folks who already knew the basics  could skip over Part I, without missing out on something of value to them. <br /> <br />This modular organization of Trace Your Roots is something I want to explain a bit more, by looking for a moment at a different genre. One of my pet peeves with computer books is most of themare either extremely basic throughout so you get bogged down in boring detail, or they are so advanced you just can't move forward. The correct approach is to include a primer on the basics for those who need it, and then write the book as though everyone knows the basics. I was pleased that Trace Your Roots took this approach. <br /> <br />Moving beyond the primer (which addresses genealogy and then genetics), the book takes one subject at a time and explains it in a clear and interesting way with examples and anecdotes. <br /> <br />In Part II, we start with tracing roots along the paternal path. There are two basic reasons for taking this path. The first is biological--the Y chromosome. The second is cultural--many cultures, especially in the West--preserve the paternal surname.  <br /> <br />There are some twists in this approach, though, and the book explains what they are and how researchers handle them. <br /> <br />The next topic is, as you might expect, tracing roots along the maternal path. The main reason for taking this path is biological--the mitochondrial DNA. I was fascinated by the explanation and implications of this. And here's a tidbit. The father's contribution (Y chromosome) contains nothing essential, which makes sense when you realize that female offspring don't have Y chromosomes (and so don't pass along the paternal line).  <br /> <br />The mitochondrial DNA, however, is very different in that respect and in other ways as well. <br /> <br />Part II also explains where various genetic groups seem to originate and why. Chapter 5 contains a fascinating account of a man who had made his African American heritage a major part of his life and identity. But through genetic testing, he discovered he had no African American heritage--what he \\"knew\\" was based on faulty family lore. <br /> <br />Where Part II delves into tracing next of kin relationships, the implications cover a wide area of interests. This kind of research affects everything from paternity suits to family reunions to identifying natural parents. Consider one anecdote the book revealed. An adopted child of unmarried parents finds her natural father, and they develop a close relationship. But, she struggles for years to find her natural mother. She uses the tracing techniques in Part II and finds her mother. But, the mother denies the man is the woman's father--and genetic testing proves he's not. You'll read other accounts where truth seems stranger than fiction, as well. <br /> <br />Part III puts the paddle in the water. It's here where you see how to apply the knowledge gained in the previous pages. This part explains how to join or run a research project, how to contact research participants, how to persuade people to donate genetic material and information, how to interpret test results, how to share results, and how to obtain the shared results of other research. If you want to research your roots, this part of the book will save you hours of frustration. <br /> <br />The final chapter of the book explains current trends and extrapolates them into some interesting predictions. The appendices are valuable to those engaged in genetic or genealogical research. There, you'll find a comprehensive guide to resources (magazines, books, societies, forms, Websites, software), a directory of DNA testing companies and DNA testing products, and a comprehensive glossary. The book is also well-indexed, making it a good reference tool for your bookshelf. <br /> <br />If you are involved in any research into your lineage, Trace Your Roots with DNA is a \\"must have\\" book.	2004-11-23

Lee vs. the IRS	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Poke fun at the world's most hated organization	This book captures both sides of \\"The IRS experience,\\" with clever and humorous cartoons. Some of the cartoons show examples of the absurd tax dodges people try to get by with. Most of the cartoons portray the mean-spirited, soulless way the IRS tortures, terrorizes, and tramples American citizens. And it makes you laugh in the process! <br /> <br />The book is funny because its portrayals of the absurd are so accurate. As voters, we actually put up with this abuse, instead of demanding that Congress do the job they were elected to do. If you're not going to demand that Congress fix the problem, then buy this book and at least have a good laugh about it. <br /> <br />One method Lee uses quite humorously is he starts with an actual situation and simply expands it to its logical conclusion. For example, we all know how a very small tax debt can grow monumentously in just a few years. The IRS routinely violates the Statute of Limitations and gets by with it. So, an overlooked $50 tax debt incurred when you're 18 can come back to haunt you just before retirement and cost you everything you have. Lee illustrates this by showing a homeless man in tattered clothing being told by an auditor, \\"With interest, penalties, and fines, your tax bill comes to $250,000. Will that be cash or check?\\" <br /> <br />Do you remember the 1984 IRS kidnapping, at gunpoint, of toddlers at a Michigan day care center? That came to mind with one cartoon that showed an IRS agent in a daycare center. In this cartoon, he's holding up three pieces of candy, while a baby cries in the background (taking candy from a baby). He's wearing a button that says, \\"IRS trainee.\\" His trainer is saying, \\"Congratulations. You have passed the first part of your agent application exam.\\" <br /> <br />There's a New IRS and Old IRS cartoon that hits dead center. And you'll snicker when you see Santa's audit. Lee explores the tax plight of military people, too--they serve their country, then get \\"served\\" by the IRS. Some thanks! <br /> <br />If you have enjoyed Doonesbury or Dilbert because they hit the bulls eye, you will enjoy Lorin A. Lee vs. the IRS for the same reason. Whether you hate the Infernal Revenue Service or the Eternal Revenue Service, you will love the jabs taken at this useless and ridiculous organization.	2004-10-10

I have never met George W. Bush, but I handed my copy of this book to Congressman Denny Hastert (Speaker of the House) and asked him if he'd sign it for me. He did so without hesitation. <br /> <br />Now, you might expect this book to be biased toward the President. It is not. But, it is also--unlike our mass media--not biased against him. This book does not seek to promote President Bush or any particular agenda. It merely seeks to explain the role of George W. Bush's personal religious convictions--his faith--in how he conducts himself as a man and as the President of the United States. It's an interesting and informative read. <br /> <br />This book is loaded with information. It's a compilation of research. Most books on political leaders are laden with opinion and conjecture--they essentially preach to the choir without providing any substance. This book is a welcome departure from such tripe. <br /> <br />Remember footnotes from those research papers you did in school? This book has 40 pages of such notes. And they're all in small type--otherwise, the page count would be 100 pages--maybe more. That alone says a great deal about the credibility of this book. It is authoritative. It uses facts and figures, rather than rhetoric and accusation. <br /> <br />If you are a Bush supporter, you should read this book so your opinions are informed opinions rather than merely the product of rightist brainwashing and rhetoric. <br /> <br />If you are a Bush-basher, you should read this book so your opinions are informed opinions rather than merely the product of leftist brainwashing and rhetoric. <br /> <br />If you are neither a supporter nor a basher, you should read this book so you can make up your mind. <br /> <br />Let me interrupt my review of this book by exposing a particular myth about President Bush. This myth says his IQ is 91. Related myths hold that he's dumb, because he mangled syntax during his 2000 election campaign. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Forces in World War II. This was definitely not a position that a low IQ person would rise to. Keep in mind that Eisenhower outsmarted Hitler's staff--most of whom had genius IQs. <br /> <br />Yet, Eisenhower was--like Bush--famous for mangling syntax in political speeches. Bush's SAT score was 1206, which equates to an IQ close to 130. This nearly qualifies him for membership in Mensa, the International High IQ Society (meaning he's just a tad below genius level). Further, he was a jet fighter pilot--a job that takes a huge degree of intelligence to qualify for. <br /> <br />So, whatever else you may think of George W. Bush, he is not stupid. If you have had that notion about him, you now know better. And if you've had that notion, then your other notions about Bush are probably also based on misinformation. To ensure your views are accurate, order this book today and read it promptly. If you read this book and still don't like him, that's fine--you will have an informed opinion. <br /> <br />Bush, as we all know, sowed his wild oats. And, he paid a price for that. Which led him to change his ways. He had an epitome, and decided to become a different person. He has worked on that for many years. A key part of his faith is tolerance. He reaches out to people of all religions. From his support of Muslims before and after September 11 to his presentation of a very high award to the Catholic Pope, Bush exemplifies the religious tolerance this nation was founded upon. <br /> <br />Some folks will say a President should keep his religion private because it's his duty to keep church and state separate. The Constitution promises freedom of religion, not silence of religion. And that is a guiding principle of how Bush conducts himself as President. Kengor provides exhaustive research to show exactly where Bush stands on the questions of church and state. You may not agree with Bush's position in that regard, and that's fine. But, you owe it to yourself to at least know what that position is. It's been inexcusably mis-portrayed by our major media--which follow their own agenda rather than reporting their findings. <br /> <br />Kengor exposes dozens of claims made by the New York Times, Washington Post, and other sources of disinformation for the lies they are. <br /> <br />For example, consider the common lie that Bush is an intolerant, Bible-thumping Jesus freak who wears his religion on his sleeve.  <br />A look at the facts shows the media are using a double standard. <br /> <br />Here are the facts. From 2000 through 2003, Bush mentioned Christ in fourteen separate statements. And, the media excoriated him for this. From 2000 through, Bill Clinton mentioned Christ in forty-one separate statements. Yet, the media did not even bat an eye toward Clinton about this. Can you say the word \\"bias?\\" If not, you'd better practice--you will see example of example of this kind of thing--all exhaustively substantiated--in Kengor's book. <br /> <br />Bush's biggest year for mentioning Christ was in 2001. Then, he mentioned Christ seven times. Two of those times were during his Easter and Christmas messages. During the same year, he honored the holidays of other major religions--all of the holidays most Americans don't ever even think about. <br /> <br />Now, here's another interesting find. For any organization--even a church--to keep its non-profit status, it cannot do political lobbying. The IRS has a duty to revoke that organization's non-profit status if that organization engages in political activities. Which is why many organization have a separate group for that purpose. But in 2000, Clinton visited many, many black churches specifically to campaign for Al Gore. Clinton gave long speeches predicting that Bush would set black civil rights back by fifty years. As we know, that didn't happen--indeed, Bush has done more for black people in his first term than Clinton did inboth terms combined. (Actually, Clinton's tax increases took money from black families and his increased regulations on businesses cost the nation millions of jobs. His failure to follow up on terrorist attacks cost the lives of many soldiers and civilians of all races). <br /> <br />While illegally campaigning in black churches, Clinton used histrionics and unfounded accusations to put real fear into blacks regarding their choice of President. The things he said were unbecoming for a President, and it was illegal for him to abuse the venue he abused to say them. But, he did this anyhow, knowing what the law was and not considering that maybe laws apply to him also and not just to others. Consequently, 85% of blacks voted for Gore. Yet, the Justice Department and the IRS failed to enforce the law. Clinton is still a free man, and none of those non-profits were penalized. In other words, a sitting President conspired with dozens of church leaders to lie about their activities--activities that had nothing to do with religion--and they all got away with it. <br /> <br />The media made zero noise about this whole sordid affair. Can you imagine how they'd react if Bush were to do this? <br /> <br />The existence of this brainwashing and bias is why you need to read this particular book. You owe it to yourself to form your own opinions, based on the documented evidence and not on lies or brainwashing. This book does not try to persuade. It merely seeks to inform. Unless you are informed, you are simply serving someone else's agenda--quite possibly to your own detriment. You now have the opportunity to learn the truth. You may decide to change your mind, whether you are for Bush or against him. But in either case, you will make a choice that is based on the evidence.	2004-09-09
US	52512173	R55Z19I2I8IS8	089526126X	359793874	Speaker: Lessons from Forty Years in Coaching and Politics	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Dignity Speaks	I have an autographed copy of this book--Speaker Hastert signed it for me in a Kansas bookstore. As the Speaker is next in line after the Vice President to be President if--God forbid--something should happen to the President or Vice President, Speaker Hastert holds the third highest position in the federal government. I want to personally thank Jack DeWolfe and the others in the Speaker's security detail for letting us have time to talk. <br /> <br />Speaker Hastert and I grew up a short ride from each other (two of my cousins grew up just minutes from his childhood home). We were both wrestlers at one time in school. But, those are not the reasons why I like him so much. <br /> <br />Congressman Hastert is, unlike many of his peers, a man of integrity. He's also got a great deal of common sense and no delusions about himself. You can't help but respect him, and I would respect him if he were still working on a feed truck in a small Illinois town rather than holding the third highest position on Capitol Hill. He is that kind of man. <br /> <br />Talking to \\"Denny\\" (as he prefers to be called), you understand a few important things about the man: <br />*He's humble. <br />*He knows what he believes and why. <br />*He does not make excuses. <br /> <br />So, what about this book? Well, it's a very hard book to put down. You find yourself glancing at the clock and saying, \\"OK, just one more page.\\" <br /> <br />Denny is candid and honest. Unlike Bill Clinton, he did not write a bloated, self-aggrandizing tome of excuses for failure and try to make it sound like success. Instead, he speaks from the heart and engages you. Oddly, though the book is about him, it isn't about him. And neither is the way he's conducted himself in public office. <br /> <br />He did not write an advertisement for the Republican Party or try to lay a foundation for a future Presidential bid. Instead, he gives credit where credit is due (regardless of party). He also tells you some of the negative--but he does so in a civil, calm, dignified way. He does not resort to name-calling or histrionics. He lays out the facts and lets you be the judge. As a reader, I like that. <br /> <br />He did not write an embarrassing book like Al Gore's \\"Earth in the Balance.\\" This is not a book that the author will later wish he could get people not to read. It is a book that he can be proud of, and it's one that will probably be read and recommended decades after he's gone. <br /> <br />Denny starts out by telling us where he came from. No silver spoons in his background. He knows the value of work, and he knows nothing is free--which explains his political philosophies. His entering politics was almost accidental, as was his rise to Speaker. He had no aspirations or grand plan to get there. Things just kind of turned out that way, and he took the opportunities as they came along. Which turned out to be very, very good for the rest of us. <br /> <br />The book provides a fascinating view into the inner workings of government at the state and federal levels. In this book, you'll find information you won't find in the biased media such as our newspapers and television (which, by the way, are undergoing huge losses of audience because of that bias--mainstream America is sick of it). Denny is amazingly unbiased and fair, which is refreshing in this age of bias and blame. <br /> <br />You'll see an insider's view of what it's like to deal with the dirty tricks played by the various bipartisan politicians, and Denny makes it clear that there are good and honorable people in both major parties. But you'll also see why our Congress and Senate have (in my opinion) been such abject failures for the past half century or so. <br /> <br />On the upside, you'll see where there's new hope. In fact, in the last six or so years our Congress and Senate have departed from their previous \\"let's fail to do what we were elected to do\\" modus operandi--they have actually done some good. That hasn'tbeen because there are now more Republicans than Democrats. No, something else is at work there and Denny explains what it is. <br /> <br />Anyone who wants a good understanding of how government works should read this book. If you pay taxes, you should consider this a \\"must read\\"--taxes are the single largest expense for nearly every citizen and this book helps you understand how that money is spent (or misspent). Denny was a high school history teacher at one time, so he knows his stuff from that angle as well as from being intimately involved in the legislative process. <br /> <br />Had I not met Denny, I probably would not have bought a book by \\"yet another politician.\\" But, that's just it. He isn't just another politician. And this is no ordinary book. <br />	2004-09-09

Maybe you've thought, \\"I wish I could do that.\\" In one sense, you can. Watch carefully, and you will notice there is always a time trapeze artists are between trapezes. They must let go of one trapeze so they can grab onto another. This is the only way they can be successful. And, it's what you must do to be successful. <br /> <br />Let's put you in this picture for a moment. Imagine yourself swinging on a trapeze high overhead. Can you let go of one trapeze to grab onto another? Or, would fear keep you from letting go? It's a long way down. Are you sure about your answer? <br />You may be saying, \\"Of course I would let go. How else would I be able to do what I'm really supposed to be doing?\\" <br /> <br />But, would you let go? This metaphor of the trapeze aptly applies in life, and it forms the theme for this book by Gail Blanke. As you read this book, you will gain insight into what degree you let go of the old and embrace the new--or let the old trapeze hold you back. And, you will find practical insights to help you do what you are really supposed to be doing. <br /> <br />You may find that you aren't letting go, after all. Most of us find this to be very difficult, if not completely alien. <br /> <br />What if you let go of the trapeze and could not catch the next one? You would fall. In the circus, you'd have a safety net. In real life, you seldom have one. And that is enough to paralyze us into letting go, so that we soar to the next trapeze bar. Instead, we hang onto the old one, letting fear rob us of the opportunity to fly to new rewards and new adventures. In the process of hanging on, we may stop moving and fall anyway. And many people do. <br /> <br />So, what does Ms. Blanke have to tell us about letting ourselves be between trapezes? <br /> <br />Ms. Blanke established herself in the executive ranks, first at Avon. She is now CEO of Lifedesigns. Her string of accomplishments started in her youth, when shewas a champion swimmer. She missed qualifying for the US Olympic team by one tenth of a second! She is a motivational speaker with other books to her credit. She's also an executive coach, and her clients include such notables as Senator Bob Graham. <br /> <br />She has spent a fair amount of time between trapezes herself, and in this book she shares insights that are both practical and motivational. She walks through case histories that show how she and other successful people faced and overcame doubts--how they let go of the old trapeze bar and grabbed the new one. And she provides exercises that can help you do the same. <br /> <br />If you're stuck in the same old routine and wonder if there's more to life, the answer is yes. If you work hard at your job but can't seem to get ahead, the answer is probably in this book. If you just can't bring yourself to let go of old notions or old doubts about yourself or others, this book will show you how. <br /> <br />One old notion many people have is they are right about others being wrong. Being right in this way feels good at first. But, it keeps you hanging onto the trapeze of what others are doing wrong rather than allowing you to reach for the trapeze of what you are doing right. Listen to yourself talk. Is it about \\"them\\" or about you? <br /> <br />If you are mulling over what other people did, you are hanging onto the old trapeze. Playing the \\"somebody done me wrong\\" song simply is not going to allow you to create an environment for success. You have to move on. The same cure applies if self-doubts make you put a death grip on the old trapeze so that you cannot be the person you are capable of being. <br /> <br />Let go of the old, and embrace the new. Ms. Blanke expertly guides the reader in exactly how to do that. You've got to make moves anyhow, no matter which trapeze you hang onto. Why not make the right moves, by letting go of the old trapeze? Once you allow yourself to be between trapezes, you will be ableto use the new trapeze to reach new highs of success. <br /> <br />I found the book a delightful read, and it made me think in new ways. That's a refreshing combination. More than that, it's a winning combination.	2004-08-24

Powers Consumer Satisfaction Survey? And why is it Toyota has not laid off a single worker since 1950? Ideas. Toyota uses hundreds more ideas per worker than do its American counterparts. <br />  <br /> While Toyota is a stunning example of how one company gets and uses employee ideas, this book isn't about Toyota. It's about liberating people and transforming organizations through ideas. Not necessarily big ideas, but ideas that come from every person in the organization and add up to big things. <br />  <br /> The typical organization is an idea desert. This well-researched book shows you, through case histories and clear explanations, how any organization can transform that desert into a lush land that produces bumper crops. <br />  <br /> One key is tapping into the vast resource of employees who are closest to the work. Managers have a perspective that is excellent for addressing the larger picture. But to have that perspective, managers are necessarily removed from being close to the work. Thus, they simply are not in a position to see how to improve the work. <br />  <br /> Another important concept that many managers fail to put to use is that of massively parallel eyes, ears, and brains. Joseph Antonini taught us that ignoring these inputs is very dangerous--he nearly ruined K-Mart by assuming his ideas were the only ones that really mattered. <br />  <br /> We have to remember that employees are often leaders and thinkers outside of work. They rear children, hold leadership positions in their churches, hold leadership positions in their trade or professional organizations, conduct neighborhood watches, pay mortgages, coach softball teams, teach children how to ride bikes, care for their aged parents, plan vacation trips, plan and prepare meals for guests, conduct hundreds of financial transactions eachyear, safely navigate their way around strange neighborhoods or even cities they have never been to before, conduct research at their library and online, send their spouses or children off to war and support them across vast oceans, and.... You get the point. And this is a point that Ideas Are Free brings to front and center. <br />  <br /> Companies who treat employees as a brain trust have an enormous advantage over companies that treat employees as a cost they'd like to eliminate. This book shows you how to treat employees as a brain trust, based on what other companies have successfully done. It also alerts you to some pitfalls and explains why certain approaches don't work. <br />  <br /> The competitive advantage that will most determine the future of any company is brainpower. It's not a matter of hiring bright people. It's a matter of correctly managing the brainpower you already have. And that's why I recommend Ideas Are Free to anyone who is in a management position. <br />  <br /> In today's globally competitive environment, you can't afford to operate on the same premise Antonini did. <br />  <br /> You need ideas. And, they are free--if you know how to look for them.	2004-07-31

When you think about it, this metaphor is more than just a little appropriate.<br />When you look for a job, don't you feel you are putting on a performance, in the hopes of pleasing the hiring audience? Don't you dress for the part, and even rehearse your lines? If you are like most job seekers, you even bring a program (resume) to the interview.<br />Many job seekers study their lines, but deliver stiffly or play to the wrong audience. Or, they audition for a role they just aren't cut out for. If they do get the part, they find themselves miscast. This book helps you avoid those mistakes and others.<br />While the thespian theme makes this book interesting and engaging, you begin to real value right away. In the first few chapters, the book presents extensive self-assessment tools. In using these, I was impressed with their accuracy. I also found them fun to use. According to a wide selection of literature on the subject, few job seekers properly address this area. One reason for that is it's a tough area to address. Most of us find it too much effort, and so we skip it and hope for the best. Which we seldom get. However, Sabatino makes that self-assessment work seem effortless.<br />The book would be well worth its price, even if it stopped as early as its third chapter. But, that's only Act One. In Act Two, Sabatino offers hard-hitting, practical advice on everything from landing the interview to negotiating the salary. Her advice on networking is something the career-minded would do well to re-read quarterly.<br />Throughout, the book contains case histories and examples. So, in addition to providing information in an interesting way it also provides you with a glimpse into what others have done. You can draw lessons from these examples as you walk through the experiences of others.<br />If you follow this book from start to finish, you will have a well-choreographed job search. You will have addressed all the vital points, leaving nothing to chance. And in today's job market, such an approach can make all the difference.<br />I give this book a standing ovation.	2004-07-14

During the 1980s and 1990s, I read just about every job book published. Of all those books, What Color is Your Parachute? and Don't Send A Resume stand out in my memory. And now I can add a third.<br />When I first came across this book, I recognized Chandra Prasad's name because I had read her in the Wall Street Journal countless times.<br />This book was well-researched, and it helps the reader connect the dots. I've read books where the author admonishes the reader, &quot;Make sure you research the company! Look them up in Value Line!&quot; I've been on dozens of interviews and have found this advice completely worthless. You probably have, also. This made me think maybe I could write such drivel and sell a book.<br />Quite frankly, you won't impress an interviewer just because you can rattle off the names of the members of the Board of Directors or quote from the company's last annual report. If anything, you will just irritate this person--especially if you don't know other things that you should know.<br />Ms. Prasad took a different approach, telling us what kind of information to look for when researching a company. As I read this, I thought, &quot;Yes! This is exactly what a job seeker needs to know!&quot; And so it went throughout the book.<br />Ms. Prasad's practical advice takes you through the entire job search process, starting with a personal inventory--a step most people shortchange because they don't understand how to do it. And they pay for that shortcut with longer job searches and shorter stretches of employment. That consequence is true of each step in the job search process, actually. Which is why the approach of this book is so valuable to anybody who is in the job market. Most people let the job market beat them, but this book shows you how to beat the job market--just as its title implies. If you want to win this particular battle of wits, you need to be well-armed--and this book is a regular Howitzer.<br />If you hold a job, you are likelyto be looking for one soon. If you are looking for a job, you will likely be looking again. If you are spending your time massaging your resume, you will be looking for a while. If you take the time to read and apply this book, you will shorten your job search and lengthen your subsequent employment.	2004-06-22

Dorsey examines various approaches people use toward this end, before describing his own.<br />He begins by showing us how the market is not rational. Never has been, never will be. I personally experienced this during the dotcom stock bubble. I had shares of stocks that, per rational theory, should have done remarkably well. I did not own shares of Yahoo--which, per rational theory, was a total dog. My stocks stayed flat, while Yahoo soared. So much for rational theory. If you get nothing else from this book, the explanation of that lesson alone makes it worth reading.<br />Next, Dorsey delves into the three general concepts of psychological trading. All of these seem good on the surface, but results are inconsistent. Maritimers long ago learned how to navigate by triangulation. Dorsey navigates the stock market the same way, with his &quot;triunity&quot; approach. He shows how looking at the intersections of the three general concepts produces consistent results.<br />You may have read books espousing some &quot;can't miss&quot; philosophy or another. Don't worry--Dorsey lets the reader know his triunity approach still requires judgment. For example, if the indicators are in a certain area, that would be an indication that the market is about to hit a peak.<br />Dorsey explains that his method might miss the peak. And, it might miss a trough. But if you are not greedy, his method would appear to be a useful tool for profitable investing. Remember, pigs eat well but hogs get slaughtered.	2004-06-12

We are also bombarded with messages designed to make us want to buy things or join organizations. Many of our activities--including work and play--are at odds with who we really are. We make the wrong educational choices, career choices, and leisure choices. And we may feel frustrated, restless, unfulfilled, or even despondent due to this.<br />So, what's the answer? Harris believes the answer lies in valuing ourselves as individual human beings and finding out who we really are. In &quot;Sacred Selfishness,&quot; Harris draws lessons from the classic quest stories--such as those involving the Greek and Roman gods, Biblical heroes, and other icons of our culture. He demonstrates how to question the very assumptions that we have taken for granted--assumptions that have formed a sort of glass cage from which many of us never escape. This questioning, and the journey it takes us on, leads to discoveries of our own potential.<br />Self-knowledge provides a basis for strength in ourselves and an understanding of others--thus we enjoy life more and love more fully.<br />In addition to being philosophical, the book is practical. Harris demonstrates the techniques of journaling and dialoguing, plus presents some other tools for those seeking self-knowledge. Harris provides case histories, and gives insight into the kinds of issues a person should consider delving into.<br />Be warned, though. This book contains no simple recipe, cute formulas, or six step process for transforming yourself into a superhuman. It does provide a solid foundation for the thinking person who wants to develop more fully and realize her or her own potential. With a bit of work and this book as a guide, you can expect a rewarding journey of self-discovery.	2004-06-05

I enjoyed it thoroughly. How Hamill came up with such a complicated, unpredictable plot might make for a book in itself.<br />What happens when an arrogant columnist abuses his power and people get hurt? In this case, he creates a time bomb that ticks for 10 years. And the consequences explode from the pages. We see Hank Tobin face one challenge after another, with the rug continually yanked out from under his feet. His ex-wife Julie won't even talk to him, until circumstances force them to work together to save first their son from a frame-up. While they work against the clock, their daughter is also framed. With both of their 20-ish children facing stiff prison sentences for crimes the didn't commit, Hank Tobin's long list of enemies attacking him at every turn, ghosts of affairs and betrayed love spooking Hank and Julie, the situation looks hopeless time and time again.<br />But, they both have allies. And, they  have each other. The thing is, it's hard to tell who their friends are and who their enemies are. This book has one surprise after another. You expect to see people constantly betrayed by their own weaknesses and that happens. But in this story, they are betrayed by their strengths, as well. While they overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, they remain human. And in that lies their only hope of salvation.<br />Adding to the flavor of the book is Hamill's detailed knowledge of New York City places and cultures. He also gives vivid descriptions of events--you can almost feel what the character must be feeling. For example, in one scene we see an immigrant of Arabic descent undergo a humiliating and terrifying search at an airport. In another scene, Hank barely escapes violence at the hands of a vigilante group. We also feel, right along with Hank, as he deals with his desire and love for his ex-wife. His anguish as a father with a son imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit also comes through. It's a story about parental love in various forms: twisted, abused, redeeming, lost, found, empowering, protecting, saving. It's a story about ambition in various forms, too. And it's a story about forces colliding, bouncing off of each other, seeking balance, and pushing people from rocks to hard places and back again.<br />Here's an interesting tidbit: I'm writing this review on Mother's Day, and my mother recommended this book to me. If you like a nail-biter, you will enjoy this book.	2004-05-09
US	52512173	RADI99AR53JOR	0805075615	641939565	In the Company of Soldiers: A Chronicle of Combat	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Informative and entertaining	While many people expect a book written about a war topic to be an academic tome that discusses dry things like tactics, or to be a post-war propaganda piece, this book is neither. Where this book is strong is in its human side--we see the people in the war, not the war with people in it.<br />The writing is strong, and the book maintains a fast pace. It's entertaining, because it looks at the situation and the people involved. At times, you can almost feel the desert sand in your teeth. <br />Atkinson adds wit to observation, and provides us with an insider's view of the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army during its mission in Iraq. While Major General (two-star) Petraeus is de facto the star of the book (and he's pretty much a force of nature in his own right), Atkinson skillfully gives others--both above and below Petraeus in command--a voice. There are no cardboard caricatures and no bit players. It's not a book about a general or handful of officers commanding legions of storm troopers or faceless soldiers. Everyone is important. Atkinson shows this with distinctly personal quotes--sometimes hilarious ones--from people at all levels in the 101st.<br />We get into the spirit of the 101st, pick up the lingo, and learn a significant amount about the military very early--and very easily--in the book. I like that.<br />This book doesn't begin with tanks clanking across the terrain or with pilots heading off toward the enemy strongpoints. It begins in a Shoney's parking lot in Hopkinsville, KY. From there, it goes to Fort Campbell, KY. The real saga of any military campaign begins in such places, and this is something Atkins shows in a clear and entertaining way. And it is here we begin to see the staggering importance of logistics. We later see how mistake in logistics created problems for Petraeus and others in the 101st, and how they made tough choices because of those problems.<br />This book held two surprises for me.<br />First, anyone who grew up in the Vietnam Era and/or watched episodes of Air Wolf (Ernest Borgnine, Jan Michael Vincent) or Tour of Duty has this idea that the helicopter is an awesome weapon of war and the symbol of American power on the battlefield. This is apparently what American planners at the highest level thought at the beginning of the the Iraqi War. The reality is quite different. But, Atkinson doesn't spout an armchair general opinion as though he's some kind of expert. He lets us see this through the eyes of General Petraeus, the pilots, Lieutenant General (three star) Wallace, and others. These are people who assessed the first--and ill-fated--Apache assault mission (not flown by the 101st, but by a different company) and developed a very different way of deploying helicopters. A way that proved to work very well. It's this kind of inside view that makes this book so fascinating.<br />I got my second surprise when I came upon the many captioned photos at the center of the book. These put faces with the names and added depth to an already enjoyable book.<br />Unfortunately, there's a fly in the ointment. Atkinson included leftist political remarks that simply fell short of the caliber of the rest of the book, and I found this jarring. It's as if Atkinson wants the reader to know he's a product of the liberal left and oblivious to the mainstream point of view. I hope a future edition has this editorializing edited out. Yet, I still enjoyed the book. I would have enjoyed it more if the author had focused on telling the story. It was a good story. In fact, it was an excellent story. I would sum it up in two words: &quot;Air Assault!&quot; Read the book and you'll know what that means.	2004-04-12

And while this book was intended for Generation Xers, I found it hit many of the same issues my own generation (baby boomers) have faced--especially those of us boomers who were born just at the end of the baby boom.<br />The crisp writing is evidence of the journalistic backgrounds the authors bring to the table. And so are the many interviews. The authors drew on widely varying experiences and stories, to paint a mosaic of what women face at the age of 30. That mosaic consists of a range of pressures based on unrealistic expectations. Just look at three such expectations, for example:<br />Expectation to look young forever. I remember when my own mother turned 30. She was sitting on the porch with a neighbor, when the neighbor's husband joked about her being over the hill and the need to trade up to a new dishwasher. While he thought that was harmless humor, he wasn't far off the mark in conveying the way women are often perceived in certain occupations (for example, acting) or in certain social environments. I remember watching an episode of Love American Style, where a man walks into an appliance store advertising &quot;Trade in your dishwasher.&quot; He then walks out with a younger woman. In America, women are expected to be permanently young and beautiful. One actress, for example, was getting botox at the age of 29. Why are women not valued for who they are? Why is it bad, if they are themselves?<br />Expectation to bear children. This is one of the problems the book discussed. Yes, many women feel a pressure not to look old, because their looks are more valued than their maturity. But at the other end of the spectrum, most women feel pressure to have children once they hit 30--because their their biological clocks are ticking loudly by that time. This pressure is both biological and social. And it can be immensely burdensome.<br />Expectation to haveit all. What does this mean? This is the central issue this book deals with, and it's here that we male baby boomers are saying, &quot;Been there, done that, doing it again.&quot; For women, however, this expectation is more complex than for men. And at about the age of 30, women are declining in their ability to meet the two expectations mentioned above. The book delves into this expectation in a way that, while using examples of 30-ish women, has near universal resonance with everyone else.<br />Understanding these expectations and the effects they have on women who are at or around 30 years old can help any person who has work-based or social interaction with these women. And, it can help you understand your own expectations, if you are in some other category than a 30-ish woman.<br />But the real power of the book is how all of this builds toward the final chapter, &quot;Guts and Grace.&quot; It is there that the reader gains insights from women who have passed through their 30s--perhaps decades ago. What the women say is truly valuable. But even more valuable are the object lessons they bring. No longer concerned with the pettiness of meeting other people's expectations of appearance, youth, wealth, position, or other less meaningful aspects of life, these women are examples to other women--and to men.<br />For people feeling disappointed by, disillusioned with, or overwhelmed by life, this book brings hope. As one woman says in the final chapter, &quot;...this is my life, and it is what I have. I am going to make the most of it.&quot; I like the fact that this woman, and others quoted in the book, explain the meaning behind that thought.	2004-03-21

You see, I'm in Mensa (the High IQ Society) and there are some problems with how we are often portrayed in movies or written about in books and periodicals.<br />And so I'm a little edgy when someone starts talking about intelligence. When Chapter One started talking about Mensa and I saw the subhead, &quot;Are Mensa Members Narcissistic?,&quot; I thought, &quot;Here we go again. More negative stereotyping.&quot; But, it wasn't that at all. It was actually &lt;gasp&gt; a solid piece of writing that left the reader accurately informed. This whole book is like that. Williams is a researcher, and everything in the book is backed by something other than the opinionated blather that seems to dominate publications today. And that something consists of--well, you can read the book to see what I mean.<br />Not to dwell on Chapter One, but I have quite a bit of interest in this subject and if I tell you about how well Williams handled Chapter One you will get a feel for the overall quality of the book. Inside Mensa, we geniuses debate all the time about what intelligence is and what genius is. The standard intelligence tests basically address only 7 areas of intelligence--primarily those involve in information processing and  reasoning ability. This is a bit myopic.<br />Why is this myopic? For example, consider an elite athlete.<BR>I'm very much into climbing. After you reach a certain level of conditioning (the hardware), everything else is mental (the software). So, as you climb you become more &quot;intelligent&quot; at climbing.<br />Michael Jordon was perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time. This was not due to his physique, good as it was. Ditto for Muhammed Ali, Dan Gable, Bruce Lee, and many other stars of the athletic world.<br />If this example of the athlete is not enough for you, consider people who amaze us with their creativity or other talents despite not being known for their math or reading skills:<BR> * Painters: Rembrandt, for example.<BR> * Actors and actresses: Meryll Streep and Cher have given riveting performances that few others could ever achieve.<BR> * Race car drivers: Try one of those race care simulators, and you'll see this job requires some elite brainpower rather than ordinary intelligence.<BR> * Salespeople: Why are some so successful and others not? It's literally all in their heads!<BR> * Craftspeople: Journeyman electricians, stone masons, sheet metal fabricators, tool and die makers, and machinists are geniuses in their trades.<br />It takes years to become proficient--that is, to develop the intelligence to do these jobs correctly.<br />The list goes on and on. The point is there are many areas of intelligence our standard tests don't even look at. Just because you don't get a score of X on some standard test doesn't mean you aren't very, very smart. Williams brings this point out and helps readers to really see where they are smart and perhaps why.<BR>Williams takes this same approach in subsequent chapters, addressing such things as how creative you are, how healthy your relationships are, how good a lover you are, and how happy you are. He even has a section that helps you discover where your locus of control is and what that means.<br />The book contains 12 simple tests. After each test is an explanation that helps you interpret your score. Williams also provides very useful information on how you might address some needed areas of improvement.<br />How Do You Compare is a good tool for personal assessment. It can help anyone to squelch the negative messages of insufficiency we constantly are bombarded with. And, it can help other people to overcome overestimates of their abilities. But, I think it will primarily help people to take stock of themselves and feel pretty darn good. <br />You can use this book to keep yourself mentally and emotionally on track. Perhaps if enough people did, we'd all live in a muchbrighter world.	2004-03-05

Record numbers of people are on Ritalin and other behavioral drugs. Yet, they are not cured of what ails them. They simply get alleviation from the symptoms. Others have been in talk therapy for months, or even years, and yet still grapple with the problems that sent them there in the first place. Is there any hope for these people? After reading &quot;The Instinct to Heal,&quot; one can only answer with a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />Behavioral drugs treat only symptoms, and they carry undesirable side-effects. Talk therapy seeks to resolve the underlying problems, but it addresses our conscious thoughts to do so. And therein lies the problem.<br />The human brain is composed of two structures, one imposed over the other. These two structures are very different in construction. The logical brain--the one that contains our conscious thoughts--forms a sort of covering over the emotional brain. This emotional brain is composed of limbic structures--and these are the same in all mammals.<br />The key to effective healing is to &quot;reprogram&quot; the emotional brain. This may sound like an impossible job, but it's not. The emotional brain contains natural mechanisms for self-healing. Thus, Servan-Schreiber's &quot;instinct to heal&quot; concept.<BR>Servan-Schreiber explains this concept in a logical, lucid manner. But, he does this in a way that allows us reach our own conclusions. Topics covered include brain structure, heart coherence, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, the energy of light, the power of Qi, the role of Omega 3 fatty acids (or lack thereof) in depression, the role of exercise, and emotional communication.<br />Throughout, Servan-Schreiber provides solid evidence, anecdotal accounts, research data, and even diagrams. You can't help but learn, and enjoy doing so, as you go through this book.<BR>Servan-Schreiber ends the text of the book by providing practical guidance for the reader to begin his or her own healing process. He makes this part easy for the reader who, though knowledgeable at this point, might still be overwhelmed by trying to put all of this together. Servan-Schreiber provides a nine-step approach, which solves that problem.<br />Many books that hold out promise of a better life are often thick with paper and thin with intellect. That is not the case, here. Lest you have any doubts, Servan-Schreiber has provided an extensive appendix of resources, which anyone can use to explore this topic or related ones more thoroughly. He's also provided an extensive notes section.<br />If you really want to tap into your own inner resources, if you're tired of expensive &quot;cures&quot; and false hopes, if you want an end to medical myopia in your own life or that of someone you love, this book is for you.	2004-02-29

And it will pay for itself whether you have an emergency or not. But, let's look at the emergency part, first.<br />Governments have been using tax dollars for &quot;re-elect me&quot; programs rather than infrastructure. And they will continue to do so, due to the political climate. The New Zealand blackout some years ago didn't teach anyone any lessons. The USA underwent an enormous blackout in 2003. The underlying problems aren't even in the beginning stages of being addressed as of early 2004.<br />Water mains throughout the United States (and many other countries) are very  old, due to the same forces that caused inattention to the causes of the blackouts. These mains are leaking. Municipalities are reporting record numbers of repairs, each year.<br />As if all this weren't bad enough, the solar cycle is off. Consequently, we are having very unusual weather on earth. 2003 was supposed to be a &quot;down year&quot; in the 11-year solar cycle. But in July, the sun hit us with energy from a solar flare that was 50 earth diameters! We saw record temperatures immediately following that. And it happened again in August. Coronal holes have also been unusually active. This means more storms and more droughts. Throughout the midwest, drought conditions have reached so far down into the soil that watermains are being moved or crushed as the earth contracts around them.<br />If you don't think you need to be prepared for a loss of power or water, you are in serious trouble.<br />This book provides you with information to prepare you for one of your most critical needs--how to clean your socks, towels, underwear, bedding, and other washable items when you are without power or central water. Many people now in their retirement years remember the pre-washing machine days. Not so fondly, but they remember. People who grew up with washing machines might wrongly  assume those devices will always be available. They won't. And with this book, youcan be prepared.<br />What about the non-emergency aspect to this book? Here's something to consider. Did you take a class on how to do laundry? If so, you are one rare individual! How do you really know how much detergent to use? Most of us use way too much. Do you know the difference between soap and detergent and which to use?<br />Do you know why you must wash some things in warm water? Do you know the chemical reasons for this? Do you know why you must wash some things in cold water? Did you know that getting this wrong can mean permanent stains?<br />You'll learn all this and more from this book. You'll also learn the how and why of sorting by color and separating loads by fabric. None of this information is rocket science--you just have to know it. All of it applies to machine-washing as well as hand-washing. So, it's useful right now--emergency or not.<br />And, of course, the book holds true to its emergency-preparedness theme by providing you with information on the various kinds of manually-powered laundry equipment, where to get it, and how to use it.<br />Don't order one copy. Get several and give them as gifts. The people you care about will be glad you did. Ms. Jordan, we should all thank you for this wonderful little book. Well done!	2004-02-16

Thinking people have tended to disregard all such opinions, because none of them hold up under close examination.<br />What we've been looking for is something that explains what happened--and where we're headed--from a perspective that doesn't serve an ideological agenda. And we've been looking for that because an ideological agenda is what those terrorists had on that day--more of the same is not an answer.<br />The answer we really want is, \\"What's next?\\" We want to see what's ahead for us. Lee Harris helps us look ahead by first looking back. He takes us through the various stages of civilization and shows us how each rose to prominence and what drove it one to survive as long as it did.<br />For example, Sparta enjoyed 500 years in which it was never conquered, never had a civil war, and was never ruled by a tyrant. Even the United States cannot boast of such things--the USA has been around for less than half that time, had a very bloody Civil War, and is today ruled by a slew of law-breaking tyrants in government agencies (as was documented in Senator Roth's 12 televised hearings on the IRS). What gave Sparta such an amazing track record?<br />After explaining the source of Sparta's success, Harris moves forward through history. Along the way, he examines subsequent Western civilizations from the Roman Empire to nineteenth century Poland. It is on this journey that we see, for example, why the United States changed from a loose alliance of states to a nation with a strong central government. And we see why Poland failed to do so and what the consequences were. It's fascinating to watch Harris unfold events to expose the cultural foundations behind them, including howHitler and Mussolini rose to power.<br />The book is far from being a dry history lesson, or really a history lesson at all. It's an education in how and why world events happen. Harris provides that education by providing the reader with a factual foundation then making the reader think. Having such an education will help you understand where we are headed and why. It will help you understand what the USA must do, in its role as the world's Samurai. The USA wields a mighty sword, while also adhering to a code of behavior that people of other nations expect us to continue to uphold simply because of who we are. Harris explains what that code is, how it came to be, and why it is in the best interests of the USA to continue to uphold it.<br />The USA, despite its relatively short history, Civil War in its 9th decade, and present infestation of tyrants, is still the world's great hope. And not just because it has more military might and more wealth than any other nation in history. The nation is a microcosm of the world's cultures--the great melting pot--and the implications of that are profound. How much responsibility to the rest of the world comes with that? Answer the question for yourself, after reading this book.	2004-02-14

Actually, I heard it on cassette, narrated by Kate Burton. Ms. Burton, a stage presence in her own right, is the daughter of Richard Burton. Obviously, the publishers thought highly of this book. And they had good reason to.<br />Ms. Simons was born and reared in Leningrad, and immigrated to the USA. She's written other books, including a sequel to this one. Unfortunately, the sequel (Tatiana and Alexander) is available in some countries (e.g., Australia) but not yet in the USA.<br />As a reader, you can't help but yearn for Tatiana and Alexander to realize their hopes and dreams. Yet, they face so many obstacles along the way that it's never certain they will. Their immense and powerful love for each other is evident, time after time.<br />The siege of Leningrad, in World War II, is something few American history books talk about. But, those of us who have read about what happened know how horrific it was. Ms. Simons lived there, and was able to talk to people who had--barely--lived through it. And that siege formed the backdrop for this intense tale of passion, betrayal, and danger.<br />It all began when 17-year old Tatiana was eating an ice cream on a beach when she noticed a Red Army soldier staring at her. Events moved forward from there. As Tatiana suffered one loss after another--her twin brother, her father, her mother, and her sister--Alexander showed his love for her. He often did so at great risk.<br />In fact, Alexander risked everything for Tatiana at the end of the novel. But, this love was not one-sided. Tatiana gave of herself, repeatedly--and also took great risks. This story is not about two young people who survive war. It's really about two young people caught in a complex web spun by other people--like the devious Dmitri--while the circumstances of war also bear down on them.<br />TheBronze Horseman brings romance, suspense, and adventure together into a story that is memorable and moving. That it's also entertaining, breathtaking, and heartbreaking is simply icing on a very tasty cake.<br />Ms. Simons has a few books published. I hope she writes many more of this caliber.	2003-11-29

Review of Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew, by Bart D. Ehrman<br />Reviewer: Mark Lamendola<br />The advice \\"Don't discuss politics or religion\\" usually makes good sense, because such discussions often pit one uninformed opinion against another-with a net negative result.<br />What happens, however, when a person undertakes massive research to present an objective, respectful, scholarly view of a religious subject? One possible result is a captivating book that opens your mind and touches your heart. Bart Erhman achieved that result with this book.<br />Ehrman discusses the various agendas of the authors behind both \\"scripture\\" and \\"heresy.\\" He discusses how various writings supported the case for one faction of Christianity or another. He discusses what these writings were, how they came to be, how they were discovered after centuries of being lost, and how scholars have analyzed them.<br />During all of this discussion, Ehrman doesn't push an agenda of his own. Indeed, he appears to explain the views and goals of each faction without taking the side of any of them. Consequently, the book moves the reader to a deeper, more informed, appreciation of Christianity. That appreciation creates a desire to replace divisive dogma with healing spirituality.<br />The New Testament did not exist in early Christian times. It came about much later, and was a weapon in the battle for dominance among various factions. It served to unite many disparate churches into an orthodoxy. But, that orthodoxy necessarily negated the views of those whose \\"scriptures\\" weren't included in the New Testament. The New Testament is a collection of writings that support a particular set of views of Christianity (Ehrman explains why this is both a good thing and a bad thing).<br />Many of the canonized books are not what they are commonly purported to be. In fact, some of them are forgeries. At first glance, such a statement seems inflammatory. Perhaps that's why Ehrman takes the reader through the evidence-rather than making simple proclamations. Here's a tidbit to consider. You may not know that III Timothy was considered for canonization, but then dropped-while II Timothy was included though it was known to be a forgery. What about the other books of the New Testament? And what about the other books that didn't make it into the New Testament? Ehrman answers those questions in a manner that does not attack Christianity, but instead reframes it in the spirit of truth.<br />Many churches have split over differences in \\"following God's Word.\\" Often, the underlying disagreements arise over interpretations of a passage in the New Testament. The \\"combatants for Christ\\" may mean well, but they both are most likely basing their differing interpretations on a forgery-rather than an Apostolic letter. As a result, we have many sects of Christianity rather than one true way.<br />As varied as our flavors of Christianity are today, however, the variance was much greater in the early years of Christianity. Understanding this basic fact and understanding where our divisive doctrines came from will help anyone be a better member of the Christian family. For anyone who seeks to achieve such a goal, this book tills the soil and plants the seed. If you can do just a little watering and weeding, your faith will grow like a mustard seed.	2003-09-29

Take a trip to the library, and look at magazine articles from a decade ago. Why are they twice as long as today's articles? Why is it \\"people don't read?\\" Or listen? Or, as we are increasingly hearing, think? The answers to these and other important questions regarding a fundamental shift in the way people process information and respond to it are in The New Brain.<br />The trends toward shorter attention spans, instant gratification, and \\"dumbing down\\" have been the subjects of one guru after another. Yet, the discussions have been largely opinion and open to debate. Until now.<br />Restak settles the questions and removes all doubts by using modern medical imaging technology to literal look into the working, living brain itself. From the studies he cites and the explanations he provides, we can clearly see that the brain \\"of modern man\\" is rewiring itself to adapt to television and other rapid-fire, image-intense media. Restak pushes the subject further, to show that this adaptation is not without its costs.<br />For example, brains rewired to adapt to these unbalanced inputs lose their ability to work in the abstract. This ability is important for invention, creation, conversation, imagination, and even good love-making-things that make us human.<br />While the book is fascinating in its own right, the information is worth far more than its value for party chatter. Restak has handed his readers the keys to their own destinies. By understanding the effects of what we watch, see, read, and listen to, we can determine how much of this rewiring goes on. Empowered by the information in The New Brain, the reader can adapt to the new inputs without becoming lost in them.<br />Other books will surely emerge on this topic. Make this one the first in your collection.	2003-09-01

While some of the material is dated, the underlying problems are still with us.<br />The book, due to its date of publication, doesn't reveal, for example, the OMB finding that IRS employees stole over 4300 government computers in 2001 nor does it reveal the results of a 2003 investigation that shows when they aren't busy stealing computers, IRS employees are spending over half their Internet time at the office visiting porn and gambling sites. Because of the date of the research, Roth doesn't include references to many news articles about how IRS employees devote themselves to terrorizing American citizens, selling confidential information, breaking laws with impunity, and running scams like the famous Hoyt Fiasco (well-documented online).<br />Yet, the book is very useful and important. In it, Roth reveals how individual managers in the IRS are completely unaccountable to any civil authority. He gives case after case of horrendous abuses.<br />Roth also reveals the steps taken to reign in some of the abuse, and he explains some things ordinary citizens can do to protect themselves. But he also leaves us with an awareness that the IRS is still too powerful, too unaccountable, and too corrupt.<br />The book should be required reading. An update is long overdue.	2003-09-01

Miller, in which Miller quoted none other than Ray Bradbury on the topic of cloning. One might think Bradbury would be all for it. Instead, he says, \\"It's better to go to be and make a baby, isn't it?\\"<br />The issues behind such a statement go far beyond the pleasure aspect, as McKibben-who is no enemy of science or scientists-so aptly and persuasively points out. In \\"Enough,\\" McKibben takes us on a thought-provoking journey of logic, where we examine the issues behind such things as germline engineering, nanotechnology, and robotics. He persuasively explaines the folly of technology for technology's sake, and helps us draw the line between that which is beneficial and that which is not. In other words, that which is enough and that which is over the line.<br />I very much like the way McKibben explodes the myth that folks who develop technology are experts in how it should be used. Many people who provide us with assurances on the value of a given technology is-no matter how far it's taken-aren't qualified. A case in point is television. Heralded in its early days as something that would bring to every citizen a vast knowledge and appreciation of history, the arts, and higher learning-it is, instead, an electronic lobotomizer.<br />McKibben does more than provide several compelling arguments as to why assurances by technologists are unreliable-despite the best of intentions. He goes on to explain the consequences to technology developers, end-users, and society at large, when we don't look at technology from a wider perspective than the assumption our role is to continually develop and employ it.<br />If you like to scratch the surface of important questions, this book is more than enough-without being too much. If you are at the other end of the spectrum and like todeeply ponder complex questions of what makes us human and what our technological limits are in light of that, this book is enough to fuel the flames. One flaw with \\"Enough\\" is it simply is not enough. While it was satisfying on many levels, it left me wanting to read McKibben's other books. I'll read his \\"Then End of Nature,\\" but I will impatiently wait for his next book. If all of McKibben's books are of this caliber, I'm not sure we'll ever have enough of them.	2003-05-18

Farson hits the nail on the head, time after time. Usually when I review  a management-related book, I don't post the review because I can't come up with a positive one! Most books on this topic oversimplify and make recommendations that have me wondering just how stupid the author thinks people are. The fact I will post a review of this management book is a ringing endorsement.<br />I listened to this book on tape--the author is a very good narrator. But now I am convinced I need a hard copy to refer to every so often. One reason this book succeeds is the author guides the reader into a different way of looking at common management problems. Common solutions (those most often prescribed by the typical management books) merely exacerbate problems. In reality, management problems defy resolution via simple formulas.<br />Understanding why things are as they are is the first step to successfully coping with them. Things are not always as they seem. What does this mean to a manager who must solve problems like employee dissatisfaction? That is a question Farson answers extremely well. The answer is not \\"be a robot and do this.\\" <br />Instead, Farson shows you how to best use the talents, knowledge, and intelligence you already have. Farson shows you how to identify the real issues and where to look for achievable resolution.<br />Personally, I like a book that doesn't assume I am a programmable robot but instead helps me grow in my own area of expertise. That is why I decided to post a review of Management of the Absurd.	2003-03-16

Throughout the text, Strogatz made me laugh out loud-reminding me very much of the engaging, \\"can't put it down\\" writing style used by Bill Bryson (author of Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail and The Lost Continent).<br />Strogatz takes a complex topic, and explains it in a way that even folks with no innate interest in the topic will find enjoyable. I learned quite a bit about how and why everything from atoms to planets will suddenly act in unison-or not do so. My newly-gained understanding of the relationship between sleep cycles and body temperature cycles has already helped me make some positive changes. Then there's the explanation of traffic....<BR>Not once did Strogatz use an intimidating equation-or any equation at all. Instead, he treats the reader to rich metaphors, analogies, and examples. And instead of dry history on how sync got where it is today, Strogatz shares the frustrations, peculiarities, and human drama of the people behind the developments. Strogatz keeps a pace that is more in line with a Tom Clancy novel than a book focused on a science topic.<br />The ending made me go back to the beginning-to the dedication, actually. I never cared about dedications, before. However this one really meant something to me after I read Sync. Strogatz dedicated Sync to his departed friend Art Winfree, without whom Strogatz would never have taken his fabulous journey and without whom such a marvelous book would not have been possible.	2003-03-05
US	52512173	RQP5DT6JA3FNV	0312275544	536026728	A Shortage of Engineers: A Novel	Books	5	6	7	N	N	No shortage of wit and wisdom	A Shortage of Engineers is a must-read book. If you love Dilbert, Office Space, or just plain common sense, this book will appeal to you. It strips away the thin veneer of sanity that hides the dysfunctionality that characterizes large companies, while entertaining with a love story and a rite of passage for a young engineer. Any thinking person will see deep meaning in this book, but the other 90% of the population should view it as a wake up call.<br />In my past life, I worked on large contracts as an engineer. Grossbach hits resounding chords, again and again. I found myself cheering at some points. At others, I nearly cried. But mostly, I laughed. Out loud. If you're tired of dealing with politics in the workplace, politics on your kid's soccer team, or any kind of nonsense, you will find A Shortage of Engineers is more documentary than fiction.<br />To all you dysfunctional, cut-off-from-reality CEOs out there, you really need to read this book. If only you knew what kind of waste goes on in your organization, how ridiculous it is, and how foolish it makes you look....<br />This is one of the best books I have ever read! I have a feeling that if everyone read it prior to voting, we'd have a far different legislative landscape. We would not have the IRS, for example. Think about it. The only purpose of the IRS is to give a group of hostile, insane, stupid people a place to go where they can make harassing phone calls and send out threatening letters. This is cheaper than building asylums for them and hiring people to take care of them. We have a few dozen IRS-inflicted deaths each year, and consider that normal.<br />As A Shortage of Engineers points out, lunacy is quite normal. The best thing we can do about it is laugh. And A Shortage of Engineers will have you in stitches.	2001-07-27

What a pleasant surprise to find that Chandler's &quot;17  Lies&quot; is high on substance and has no hyperbole. <br />While most  &quot;self-help&quot; books pander to the unthinking, Chandler relies on  some of the greatest thinkers ever--both of our time and other eras.  Consider, for example, that he quotes my fellow Mensan, Marilyn vos  Savant--who has the highest IQ ever measured. That Chandler ends each  chapter with an insightful quote from a great thinker is a nice touch, but  no surprise. The evidence of the breadth and depth of his reading is  marvelously evident in his writing.<br />Chandler uses real-life examples, not  just theory. These made me stop and think, &quot;I've done that!&quot; And  now I can do something about that and be better for it. Chandler's  recounting of an event in a retail outlet had me saying, &quot;Good for  you!&quot; and &quot;I can do that, too.&quot;<br />Any serious student of the  martial arts knows that to prevail against the enemy before you, you must  prevail against the enemy within. Chandler deftly explains how to do this,  in 17 ways that will free almost anybody to greater accomplishment and  vastly more happiness.<br />Chandler doesn't stop with exposing the 17 lies.  That's in Part One of the book. In Part Two, he shows you how to use your  newfound freedom.<br />What I really like about the book is Chandler  communicates these life-changing ideas in a way that is entertaining. This  kept my interest up through the whole book. That is quite a feat,  considering the deepness of what he covers in this most excellent book.	2000-09-06

In THIS book, we see what real people do for real success.<br />I was able to formulate my own plan for success, by looking at  what these people do. This vicarious learning is the best approach for such  a subject matter, and it has become a competitive advantage for my company.	1999-09-20
