Im afraid I have to disagree with the majority on this one... this book was not worthy of the bestseller list. In the world of book editing I know that authors often sell their ideas to the publisher based on a sketchy outline and a sample chapter or two, so I can understand how Mr. Follett managed to get a contract for this book. The idea is marvelous--a sweeping plot culminating in the building of a cathedral with an intriguing cast of characters whose lives intertwine in surprising ways. But the actual execution is miserable. Not a hundred pages in I had already tired of the plodding repetition and the dull prose. Its one of those books in which the author is all too present, making sure the readers dont miss how clever he is by drilling the themes and making his research painfully obvious. As an example of the latter, when a character drinks posset early in the book, the author felt it necessary to tell us how the beverage was made, which I found annoying enough since it disrupted the flow of the story. But then, several hundred pages later I was treated to the exact same description of posset and its ingredients. The book is full of such moments when you just have to sit back and wonder what the editors were smoking when they were preparing this book for publication. But as I mentioned, its not the worst book Ive ever read, and it was intriguing enough to keep me reading to the end, so I give it two stars and a recommendation to those of you who are looking for an easy-to-digest read rather than a rich feast for the mind.	2004-07-07

I picked up this book because the description looked interesting--it seemed that this book had all the elements of my favorite kind of story: child protagonist with a great but unknown destiny, animal companions, magical plant lore, a dangerous quest, etc. I was not disappointed. The story is excellent. But I gave the book three stars because the writing didn't transport me the way I feel truly great writing should. If the whole book had been written with the same magical quality as the \\"excerpts\\" at the beginning of each chapter (which were wonderfully captivating and fantastically written), this would have been a five star book.  But with such a great story for this author's debut novel, I expect great things from her--including a great sequel--and hopefully with each book her writing becomes more developed and transporting until we can rightfully categorize her with the likes of Lloyd Alexander and Philip Pullman (as the dust jacket says).<br />If you love fantasy, read this book! You'll be glad you started reading Susan McGee Britton at the beginning of her career. :)	2003-12-31

I was expecting this book to be a magical fantasy, but it really wasn't. At first I was reading with a sense of anticipation, waiting for something magical to appear (and being slightly confused because nothing did), but as I got involved in the story, I really enjoyed it just as a fun adventure tale. I loved the atmosphere created by the runaway brothers meeting shady characters and lovable street kids in modern-day Venice.<br />But then near the end, all of the sudden the magic appears. I was really thrown for a loop. Up until that point everything had been straight-forward and realistic, so I expected the book to end the same way. Up until the last page I was hoping that the author would remember what story she was writing and have the effects of the merry-go-round wear off so that the characters could continue their lives normally, but no such luck. <br />All in all this is a fun book, and I really enjoyed reading it, but there was a huge disconnect between most of the story and the ending. The author should have woven magical elements throughout the book, or she should have tempered the magic at the end with reality. As it stands, the ending keeps this from being the great book it could have been.	2003-07-08

Finally, a gardening book that doesn't assume you have acres of land and a barn full of expensive equipment--or that you have the money to go out and buy them. <br />For three years I've been limited to a small balcony, after having lived my life with a large garden. Instead of going through gardening withdrawals, I decided to fill some containers with soil and see what I could grow. I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also been on the lookout for a good gardening book that could give me some encouragement and some fresh ideas. \\"Lasagna Gardening for Small Spaces\\" is that book.<br />I found Patricia Lanza's book to be extremely practical and down-to-earth. Even if you don't use her \\"lasagna\\" method to create your garden, you can still benefit from her advice about maximizing any small space you have to work with. The basic idea is if you don't have room to grow out, then grow up! And she's not just talking about flowers. She shows how easy it is to grow satisfying crops of just about any vegetable or fruit in tiny plots of land and containers. And she shows how to do it without spending any money. This book is peppered with ideas about how to use things we might consider to be trash as decorative containers, plant supports, and garden tools.<br />I was especially impressed with the section on pests and disease. Not only does she explain organic remedies for pest and disease problems, she spends time describing simple, natural ways to prevent pests and diseases from even becoming a problem, including a list of plants that attract beneficial insects (so you don't have to spend money to buy eggs or larvae from a catalog).<br />Perhaps what I am most grateful for in this book is its fearlessness. If the only space you have is a few containers on a balcony, Patricia Lanza doesn't tell you to buy some nice impatiens from the nursery--she tells you to grow an apple tree! If you've been discouraged by the typical container gardening book--you know, the kindthat tells you to go out and buy a ridiculously expensive decorative pot and fill it with flashy annuals from the nursery--then give this book a try. Hopefully it will give you the courage to grow a satisfying garden--flowers, vegetables, and even fruits--with whatever space you have to work with, even just a few pots on a balcony, like I have.	2003-06-29

I was skeptical when I picked up this book, thinking it would be a beat-you-over-the-head diatribe about the evils of not reading the Bible. I was happily surprised to find the opposite. James MacDonald writes as if he was sitting across from you in the local Starbucks, talking about one of the most amazing things he's ever experienced in his life. His enthusiasm for the Bible is apparent in every page of his book, but it is far from being feel-good fluff: this book gives a solid foundational understanding of what the Bible is, where it came from, and why it should be an important part of each person's life. Even more, he gives practical advice about how to start reading and benefiting from it. But best of all, he presents the gospel message and encourages the reader to make a personal relationship with Jesus Christ the starting point of their study of the Bible.<br />The primary audience for this book is people with little or no prior experience with the Bible, both people looking for answers and those with little interest in the Bible or Christianity. It seeks to convince them of the validity of the Bible as the very words of God and thus, something that all people should take seriously. But I read this book as a life-long Christian and received great benefit from it as well. Considering the Bible from a new angle was revitalizing to my appreciation of it and has renewed my respect for this amazing gift.<br />I would highly recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians alike. The conversational style of writing makes this book suitable to read on one's own--it doesn't require a study group or a session with a pastor to understand and start applying the message. Read it--MacDonald's enthusiasm for the Bible is catching and will hopefully lead you to dive into the Scriptures in a life-changing way.	2002-11-15

If you're like me, everytime you see the newest Disney picture, you can't help but wonder, &quot;What are they working on now?&quot; Well, this book might answer some of that longing (at least you'll know what they're -not- working on). Although it only spans the years when Walt himself was alive, we are shown enough of the Disney might-have-beens to fill our dreams for a while. To be honest, I didn't read most of the text (so many books; so little time), but that didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying the book, since more than 2/3 is pictures anyway. The captions are well-written and informative--probably for people like me who don't read the text so that we can get the main points anyway. It's really fascinating to see how ideas are developed and why they get scrapped even though the artwork is so terrific. A chapter on wartime Disney was very entertaining--seeing what Disney did to balance the desire to make a political statement with their particular brand of family entertainment. I recommend this book to anyone interested in art styles and the development of animation or films of any kind.	2002-08-19

The dedication of this volume tells us that Cummings wrote these tales for his daughter when she was a very little girl. But even if it hadn't, any reader would have known. As you read, it's as if you can hear a parent telling the stories to his child over a sleepy bedtime. The stories have an effortless feeling as if they are being spoken rather than written. This free and easy quality combined with the spectacularly imaginative subjects make for a really fun reading experience.<br />Unless you have a really patient child, however, I wouldn't recommend this edition for sit-on-the-lap reading. The illustrations aren't particularly engaging. Rather, I would let your kids sit down with some blank paper and a box of crayons and ask them to draw their own pictures while you read out loud to them. Or read to them at bedtime when their eyes are closed. These are the kinds of stories to be savored by the senses rather than \\"follow-along-while-I-read.\\"	2002-08-19

I love this book! The text is fun to read and really easy to understand while introducing some big scientific words. And the pictures are big and colorful, and I really mean BIG and COLORFUL. But even more than that, they are accurate--the flowers, seeds, animals, and insects can all be identified down to the species.  Towards the end it gets a little off topic, but even these pages are filled with interesting flower-facts that get you interested in further exploration of the world of flowers. There's even a touch of humor: after pages of large, flamboyant illustrations, the final page contains a single mushroom and the text, \\"Plants that have no flowers are fascinating, too.\\" I had to laugh at the simplicity and effectiveness of this ending. Last, but not least, the endpapers have a wonderful drawing that shows a flower progressing into a fruit--a wonderful summary of the purpose of the book without using any words. This book definitely gets my recommendation for anyone who wants to introduce their kids to the world of science and nature in an unintimidating, yet accurate and enjoyable format.	2002-08-17

Warm and whimsical drawings make up the bulk of this oversized picture book. Kids can follow a brother and sister through the different rooms of a rather busy household--there are different times of day, different seasons of the year, different family members present, and definitely a lot of THINGS (some of them quite wacky) scattered everywhere. Among them are a couple of stuffed animals that follow the kids everywhere they go (one is a winged donkey?!!?). It's almost like a \\"Where's Waldo?\\" as you search for them each time you turn the page. The illustrations definitely portray a well-lived-in house that is a ton of fun to explore. <br />On the down side, the text is nothing to go crazy over. To me it sounds like someone talking off the top of their head--not well-crafted prose, but momentary thoughts. It's almost as if the book was not meant to have words--the adult is just supposed to make up their own story as the kid looks at the pictures--but they included words just in case the adult couldn't think of anything to say. Sometimes the words don't even match the pictures--for the life of me I can't find the dinosaur-shaped sponge anywhere in the bathroom! <br />That aside, this is a really fun picture book on a unique subject --perfect for some quiet one-on-one exploration with your child.	2002-08-17

This is a gorgeous volume, flooded with rich, dreamy paintings--definitely the kind of book you could give as a gift (or would want to receive as one). Many of the illustrations are set off with gold borders, adding to the richness. All in all, it feels like a book the fairies made!<br />But be warned--Yolen writes of &quot;real&quot; fairies in this book--not the sweet, sugary wisps of Disney's invention, but the amoral beings who steal children and wives, sink ships and play tricks. The selections have a darkness to them that reflects more truly the faeries of folklore. <br />But even if the stories make you sad, it's worth it to melt away into the paintings and take a walk in fairyland.	2001-12-18

However, she also makes several alarming statements that colored my reading experience.<br />First, she states that stories about heroic women have been &quot;hidden... disguised... mutilated... truncated.&quot; Now, I'm not a scholar of folklore, or even an avid reader of it, but even I was familiar with many of the tales she included in her book. So I feel that Yolen may have been a bit over-dramatic on this point.<br />Another alarming statement is her explanation of why she only uses the term &quot;hero&quot; even though her protagonists are female--&quot;Because heroines... sound like lesser or minor heroes, just as poetess and authress sound as if they are not as good as their male counterparts.&quot; This sentence caught me by surprise, since, as a woman, I would take no more offense at being described as an authress as I would at being described as a &quot;chica&quot; rather than a &quot;chico&quot; in a Spanish class. Using a specialized word such as &quot;heroine&quot; simply allows more clarity if it better suits the purpose of the author.<br />At any rate, I felt that this letter revealed the author to be super-sensitive to feminist issues and perceives her gender to be attacked at any hint of a difference between men and women. The letter was flavored with a bitterness that presented the book almost as a revenge against men rather than a valuable collection to be enjoyed.<br />That being said, I couldn't help but read Yolen's stories without a heightened sensitivity to issues of male vs. female. Here's what I found...<br />First out of the gate is &quot;Atalanta the Huntress&quot; which begins like this: &quot;There was a king named Iasus, a cruel, unfeeling man who took his newborn daugter into the Calydonian forest on the far borders of his kingdom. There he put her down on the forest floor saying, 'I wished for a boy, and this is what I got. I will not have you.' Then he turned and left.&quot; Lovely. Here I'm thinking, &quot;Gee. Jane Yolen really hates men.&quot; But there's more! Later in the story, Atalanta seeks help from the royal court. There all the &quot;heroes&quot; ignored her. One says, &quot;Who is this mere girl who would hunt with heroes?&quot; Even the prince, who agrees to take her along on the hunt, is only sizing her up as a potential wife.<br />The second story begins by describing a tall, strong man who also happened to be ugly. Very ugly. His daughter is also tall and strong, but she is also beautiful and smart. Hmmm..... Later when the daughter offers to help fight the evil hippo, the ugly man refuses, echoed by his hunter pal, &quot;You are but a female... this is too dangerous a thing for a mere girl.&quot; <br />In the next story the man kidnaps young girls and cuts them into pieces. In the next story the man ties the woman to a tree, exposed to the elements and the wild animals because she disobeyed his orders. In the next story, the authorities (presumably men) ask the brave young girl who is volunteering to try to kill a giant serpant plaguing their village, &quot;What can you, a mere girl, do that ten men could not?&quot; And so on...  <br />Sure, these same character types are in countless folktales and legends. But placed in the context of the author's introduction, they take on a whole new potency of evil. It's as if Yolen is trying to teach the reader by repitition that men are unfeeling, men are untrustworthy, men are dangerous...<br />The final nail in the coffin was Yolen's choice to include the ending part of the story, &quot;Atalanta theHuntress.&quot; In it, Atalanta challenges each of her many suitors to a foot race. The first suitor to defeat her wins Atalanta's hand in marriage. We've all heard the story... the suitors never even have a chance, so strong and swift is Atalanta. But finally, one wily suitor tosses golden apples on the path before her and, as Yolen says, &quot;Atalanta could not take her eyes off the golden fruit. She desired it above all things. Stooping down, she picked it up. And [the suitor] passed her by.&quot; As far as I'm concerned, this is a huge jab at women--a statement that women are fickle and unstable, ruled by their passions and incapable of overcoming obstacles. Why in the world would Yolen choose this story for a book she wrote to liberate the &quot;disguised&quot; and &quot;mutilated&quot; heroines--I mean, heroes--of world folklore?<br />The high point of the book is the section of notes at the end. Yolen explains where she found the stories and what parts she changed as she rewrote them. This, and the bibliography, allows for further research and perhaps a more objective look at the tales as they have been passed down through the ages.<br />In conclusion, I feel this potentially thrilling collection is extremely devalued by the author's political intent. If you are looking for a great collection of stories with strong female protagonists (but without the anti-male didacticism), I recommend &quot;The Serpent Slayer and other stories of strong women&quot; by Katrin Tchana. This volume celebrates the differences between the genders, which I feel is far more empowering and constructive than forcing women to live up to--or out-do--a standard set by the actions of men.	2001-12-10

The striking cover and delicately decorated pages give this expository work on the Cross the appeal of a gift book, but with the depth and insight appropriate for serious Bible study. &quot;The Heart of the Cross&quot; is divided into three parts: &quot;Words from the Cross&quot; (an in-depth look at each of the final words of Christ from the cross, &quot;The Real Last Words of Christ&quot; (a study of the sayings of Jesus during the 40 days after his resurrection), and &quot;The Message of the Cross&quot; (which examines key New Testament verses regarding Christ's work on the cross). Many parts of this book have evangelistic overtones, making it a suitable book for giving to a non-Christian friend open to hearing the Gospel message.<br />I definitely recommend this book to Christians interested in knowing Christ and his work on the cross more intimately. This high quality book would also make a great gift.	2001-07-20

I learned early that unless you wanted to sit for an hour and listen to your dad talk, you don't ask complicated questions. I was reminded of that feeling while reading &quot;The Genesis Factor.&quot; <br />Written by two pastors, &quot;The Genesis Factor&quot; touts its intended audience as &quot;seekers,&quot; and uses the example of college students wrestling with questions of origins and meaning. The authors liken the quest for answers to a discussion around a dinner table, where the voice of the Bible, and more specifically, Genesis, is ignored as an implausible tribal myth. The purpose of their book, therefore, is to examine the Biblical text to see if it is, after all, a credible voice that deserves to be heard.<br />A fine proposition. And they do a fine job of explaining the first three chapters in Genesis from a solid, Christian standpoint. I was especially impressed with the broad use of writings other than the Bible-from literature to science and philosophy-to raise questions and illustrate mankind's various solutions. <br />The weak point of the book was in its organization. Like the trailing explanations I received as a child, &quot;The Genesis Factor&quot; answered more than it asked. Helm and Dennis based their organization on the order of the Biblical text, working verse-by-verse, and sometimes word-by-word, through Genesis 1-3. This is certainly a familiar method for experienced exegetes and for pastors who frequently consult commentaries arranged in just that manner. But for a work such as this it presents two main problems. First, for the intended audience (those who have ignored the study of the Bible all their lives), reading a Biblical commentary is a foreign concept. And, second, it tempted the authors away from answering their questions by allowing them to discuss words and phrases not critical to their main point. For example, noting that the description of the six days of creation is arranged in a beautiful parallel pattern does nothing to answer the question of the origins of man.<br />A stronger organization would have been to divide the book into three parts, each answering one of the three fundamental questions raised by the authors. The Biblical text could have been applied where appropriate within the three parts, and needless tangents could have been avoided.<br />I would recommend this book mainly to Christians looking to answer the tough questions of their friends or seeking to clarify their own beliefs. It would be difficult for a non-Christian unfamiliar with the conventions of Biblical commentary to find what they're looking for in this book.	2001-07-18

First of all, the illustrations are great--full of rich, bright colors, and the characters are just so cute! But also because this book holds a message that every kid should hear. Well, two messages, actually. First, be confident in who you are. Velvet sees the simple beauty of an apple; she sees worth in a common rock; and she understands that when you haven't got anything else, you've got your imagination. Even though the other kids don't understand her, that doesn't stop Velvet from being who she is and sharing her &quot;magic&quot; with the world. The second message comes when the other kids start to get to know Velvet and find out that she is really a lot of fun after all, even if she sees the world in a slightly different way than they do.<br />This book, along with its wonderful illustrations, shows kids that it's okay to be yourself, and that it is rewarding to get to know others (even if they're different!)... there's a lot of buried treasure out there hiding under a bit of Odd Velvet!	2001-07-18

I know that Mary Magdalene was a social outcast, but  I have a hard time believing that she acted like a 20th century woman lost in time.

And that is exactly what &quot;Juniper&quot; is about. I read it first (before &quot;Wise Child&quot;) and enjoyed it as a stand-alone novel. However, for those who are not as interested in &quot;wise women&quot; and herblore I would recommend reading &quot;Wise Child&quot; first. &quot;Wise Child&quot; has more suspense and excitement and will get you interested in the character of Juniper. Otherwise you might find yourself asking, &quot;Why should I care?&quot;<br />After reading both novels, I wish that &quot;Juniper&quot; had gone further. &quot;Wise Child&quot; reveals the events between the two novels, but I still wish the author would have actually written a third novel about the intervening events, or at least extended &quot;Juniper.&quot; Neither novel lacks--it's just that I liked them both so much I wish that there was more. <br />As much as I enjoyed reading &quot;Juniper,&quot; I would be careful giving this book to younger children as there is a detailed description of mother goddess worship. The initiation of the two young girls may also be disturbing to younger readers.	2001-07-16

It's the kind of story that a child would dream up laying on moon-drenched grass on a summer evening... you know, the kind that gives you shivers because it just might be real. I love this story for its simplicity--the author doesn't try to force it to be more than it is. She just lays it out in front of you and leaves you to ponder. And it's magical. You've just gotta love a book like that!<br />I recommend this book for older children who are ready to contemplate the issues of life and death, but who can still appreciate fantasy (It's not one of those depressing my-best-friend-died-and-it's-all-my-fault-Betsy-Byers-type books, thank goodness!).

It's a symbiosis I've never experienced in a book of poetry before, but let me assure you, it is thoroughly enjoyable!	2001-02-07

I was put in charge of creating a company newsletter and I didn't know where to begin. Someone handed me this book and suddenly the world of design opened up to me. The book is organized around the five major considerations one should have when deciding how to arrange information on a page. There is no expanatory text, just hundreds of examples to show how it can be done. For example, if you need to use a pull quote in a large block of text, this book gives you 24 different ways to do it. And its for more than just newsletters -- brochures, magazines, posters, anything can benefit from the creative ideas presented in this book. And the whole idea is to mix and match so the end result of your work is something different and creative every time.<br />I highly recommend a book like this for people like me with no design experience or even for designers who may not be having a very creative day. The ideas in this book gets the creativity flowing and shows you how to look at documents with design in mind -- to see how the pieces of information fit together, and how one interesting detail can make a dull document come alive.	2001-02-06

These well-chosen tales are told in a smooth, enjoyable style. Each tale is prefaced by a good deal of background regarding mermaids of various cultures--always interesting, though sometimes unrelated to the tale. The accompanying illustrations are simple but not unenjoyable. Overall this is the best collection of mermaid tales I've found yet. Although the paperback format makes it less apealing as a gift or keepsake item, I'd still choose this volume over the other mermaid books I've read simply for its readability. I recommend this book not just to those who love mermaids, but also to anyone who loves folklore and good stories.	2001-01-30

Fortunately, the four stories are arranged in ascending order-from worst to best, so by the time I finished I had a rather favorable impression. <br />The book starts off with an original tale by McKinley. Starting with the preface, this tale was difficult to break into. I was glad when a plot finally appeared, but by the end I was almost heart-broken by McKinley's description of Faerieland.  It is interesting as an alternative viewpoint, but I certainly don't want it to be that way!<br />The other original McKinley tale, &quot;The Hunting of the Hind,&quot; I enjoyed much, much more. I could feel sympathetic for the characters and some of the magical elements were particularly lovely.<br />McKinley also retells &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; and &quot;The Twelve Dancing Princesses.&quot; She brings out the darker side of each of these tales, which left me shivering at the end, rather than glowing with the usual happy fairy tale feeling. To many (although not to me) this dark side may be preferable, and one certainly can't deny McKinley's talent for creating atmosphere in her writing. Thus, the book earns three stars and my recommendation to those who love the darker side of fantasy.	2001-01-30

All the main characters are charmingly written (my favorites are the grumpy old grandpa and Angus, the little boy who is always ready to eat) and I loved how King-Smith described what the water horse was thinking. This book leaves you with a good feeling.<br />P.S. If you're a Pokemon fan--I wonder if this is where they got the idea for Lapras?!?	2001-01-23

I love stories about wise old women--the kind who are brave and as clever as they are caring. I was hoping this would be a book full of stories of such women, but I was disappointed. Only half of the tales featured a wise old woman as a main character, and although they were well-told, none of the stories were very compelling. As a collection, this book seemed to lack focus due to poorly chosen tales.<br />However, one element in this book is outstanding. A mural-of-sorts runs along the bottom of each page--a different mural for each tale. These murals tell the tale in minature and are a joy to explore. I found myself skipping ahead just to see what each new mural would be. This unique feature makes this book worth a look.	2001-01-22

Delightfully light tales mixed with whimsical watercolor illustrations is the recipe for an all-around fun book. Some of the tales are well-known, and others are new, but each of them is entertaining and suitably written for reading out loud or to oneself. This is a book I'd keep on hand for a quick pick-me-up since the antics of each clever hero are sure to make you smile.<br />My one complaint is that some of the stories took on too much of a modern colloquial air, which detracted from their folk-tale feel (but this is a minor detail since it never interferes with the overall point of the story). <br />Read this book... it's a lot of fun!	2001-01-22

The pictures are both lovely and funny--if you pay special attention to facial expressions I guarantee you'll be laughing out loud. Kate, the heroine, spins yarns with a skill beyond her years, painting pictures with her inventive tales. Her speech is like music--you can practically hear her brogue while you're reading. And if her storytelling doesn't convince you that she's painting pictures with her words, then the illustrations will. They vary from dreamy pastels to muted and murky to bold and bright depending on the nature of the tale she's telling. And when she stops, the world turns black and white.<br />Not only does this book contain excellent illustrations, a strong, believable heroine, and a captivating story line, but there are several surprises and an unexpected ending. I hope you'll read it... it would be a shame to miss out on such a marvelously fun book!	2001-01-19

So many fairy tale books go only half-way--either they have great pictures or a well-written story. This is not one of those. Marianna Mayer tells the story with lovely detail and a highly enjoyable style. And the artwork--well, look at the cover! The artwork is amazing! The portrait of Princess Elise almost jumps off the page (or invites you into it, whichever you prefer). And don't overlook the sidebar illustrations on each text page--they add a deeper dimension to the story by giving the reader a glimpse of the magical setting. This book is truly enchanting.	2001-01-19

If you're not sure, then this is the book for you. With matter-of-fact humor, Harriet Ziefert shows the reader what and what not to do if you are fortunate enough to catch a moonride. The muted colors of the simple illustrations contribute to its bedtime appropriateness, while the background texture and visible crayon strokes add interest to capture the attention. And by bringing the intangible into the realm of a child's every day world, this pleasant picture book is sure to encourage good dreams and a healthy imagination.	2001-01-19

This is a fantastically diverse collection of stories reaching from the Far East to the New World and stretching back to the most ancient of times. Mayer gives historical background where appropriate and includes a full bibliography for further study.  I learned about an entirely new civilization in this book (and I was an archaeology major in college!) as well as enriched my knowledge of others more well known. <br />Not all of the women in this collection are known for deeds worth emulating, but good or bad, each one fights with passion for what they believe in. The fervor of their actions surrounds them with a mystical quality that allows them to accomplish what would otherwise seem impossible. <br />These stories inspire me to think what amazing things I could accomplish if only I fight for my beliefs with passion. I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-17

Amy (short for Amethyst Alexandra Augusta Araminta Adelaide Aurelia Anne) is anything but an ordinary princess. Caring nothing for her royal status and oblivious to the social danger she poses to her family (never before had a Phantasmoranian princess grown up to be a spinster), Amy sets off to live in the most agreeable fashion she knows how--surrounded by nature, or, when need be, with the unpresuming commonfolk in the kitchen of a neighboring kingdom's castle. Amy is refreshing for her simplicity and sweetness, her innocence and her wit, qualities which are apparent in every choice she makes. And the end is absolutely charming, though it shows that, in this genre, not even a non-traditional heroine can escape her fate of ending up as a royal bride.<br />I recommend reading this tale if you're ready for a &quot;princess of a different color,&quot; but don't be surprised if you recognize some of the plot elements... it is, after all, the story of an ordinary princess.	2001-01-17

First of all, the illustrations are great--full of rich, bright colors, and the characters are just so cute! But also because this book holds a message that every kid should hear. Well, two messages, actually. First, be confident in who you are. Velvet sees the simple beauty of an apple; she sees worth in a common rock; and she understands that when you haven't got anything else, you've got your imagination. Even though the other kids don't understand her, that doesn't stop Velvet from being who she is and sharing her &quot;magic&quot; with the world. The second message comes when the other kids start to get to know Velvet and find out that she is really a lot of fun after all, even if she sees the world in a slightly different way than they do.<br />This book, along with its wonderful illustrations, shows kids that it's okay to be yourself, and that it is rewarding to get to know others (even if they're different!)... there's a lot of buried treasure out there hiding under a bit of Odd Velvet!	2001-01-17

Sent by her wicked stepmother to the hut of Baba Yaga for a light, Vasilisa escapes only by completing vast quantities of houswork. My main problem with this story is that Vasilisa doesn't actually do any of the work--the doll does--leaving Vasilisa only to cook dinner for her (very scary) captor. Why does this earn Vasilisa the epithet &quot;the brave&quot;? A better name for her would be &quot;Vasilisa the Complacent&quot; since she never actually takes control of the situation or shows any will of her own. From the moment her father dies to the time her wicked stepmother is destroyed, she bends to the will of any imposing figure that commands her if for no other reason than she can't think of an alternative (see page 2 of the story)! Don't let the title fool you... Vasilisa is not an example of a strong, clever heroine like you'd expect!<br />On a more positive note, the illustrations are wonderful. Richly ornamented, finely detailed paintings occupy every other page. The text is decorated by orientalized landscapes and persianesque illuminations. Oh, and the paintings of Baba Yaga are terrifying! I spent a long time absorbed in the artwork of this book. It truly is enchanting!<br />Bottom line: Don't look to this story for a strong female protagonist. Enjoy it rather for its fine illustrations--they will be reward enough.	2001-01-11

This work as a whole will enlarge your understanding of water maiden creatures, but don't expect to find any rivetting storytelling.<br />The value of this book lies in its cultural scope. How intriguing to note that water maidens play a significant role in the folk lore of such diverse cultures! And how interesting to see how these creatures vary from country to country (for they are not all mermaids as the title would suggest). Readers will discover an added bonus in Howell's artwork, which enhances the cultural flavor of each tale to great effect.<br />However, each tale is written in a sparse, folk tale style--flat characters and settings with little descriptive embellishments. For this reason I would recommend this book mainly to those who love mermaids and other sea creatures, rather than to those who just looking for a good story. But recommend it I do, for it is a fine collection.	2001-01-11

The fun thing about this book is experiencing (through colors and text) the emotions that Sophie is feeling. We follow Sophie through the reds and yellows of anger to the soothing blues and greens of the natural world, and back again to the warm, vibrant colors of a happy home. The simple text sets off the illustrations, resulting in a rich emotional reading experience for any age. <br />I give &quot;Sophie&quot; only two stars simply because it is not my preferred style of picture book, not because it lacks any of the criteria for good children's literature. I encourage you to give &quot;Sophie&quot; a chance.	2001-01-10

The story is about Daniel, a young man who is as complex internally as he is straightforward externally. Never before have I been so able to relate with a character so far removed from my own sphere of experience. Speare's skill to draw me into Daniel's world amazed me.<br />If you're worried that this is a book about Jesus or Christianity, don't be. Speare's accomplishment of writing a &quot;religious&quot; subject into a story without any hint of didacticism is the finest quality of this book and the greatest evidence of her skill as a writer. When I saw Jesus, it was through Daniel's eyes. And when I listened to Jesus' teachings, it was through the lens of Daniel's experience. <br />And it all came alive.	2001-01-08

The poetry, however, was not as good as I had expected. The poems lacked internal unity, resembling a list of separate events that never transitioned well enough into each other to evoke the desired image (of that particular month). There were occasional gems--phrases that stood out like holidays in an otherwise unspectacular &quot;year.&quot;  For example, &quot;January&quot; begins with these lines:<br /> &quot;The days are short,/ The sun a spark/ Hung thin between/ The dark and dark.&quot;<br /> And the first two stanzas of &quot;June&quot;: <br />&quot;The sun is rich/ And gladly pays/ In golden hours,/ Silver days,/<br />And long green weeks/ That never end./ School's out. The time/ Is ours to spend.&quot; <br />Among several other noteworthy passages, my favorite of all is this one from &quot;March&quot;: <br />&quot;The mud smells happy/ On our shoes.&quot;<br />Read it for the gems, not for a unified sense of the season, and you'll be rewarded. But then again, the pictures are reward enough!	2001-01-08
