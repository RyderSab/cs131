Specialization in preaching, counseling, evangelism, administration, and education has diffused the impact of practical theology.  And because of competing ideas as to what now is central, the very image of ministry may be breaking down. This book responds to the problem by introducing a specific method for doing practical theology which will be welcomed by concerned church leaders everywhere. Presenting a realistic, workable answer to those who call for a revival of this vital discipline, the authors propose that the unifying image for ministry becomes the formation of the community of faith.  After developing this as the most appropriate base for the practice of theology, they carefully outline their method and show how it will work by demonstrating its success in the actual experiences of typical congregations. For Christian leaders who seek to renew the integrity of ministry and restore the character of pastoral leadership, this significant book will provide a solid foundation.  And for individuals interested or involved in education for the future of the church, this important resource will prove invaluable. <br /> <br />	2005-09-29

Whereas a theology of transfiguration has long been an essential part of the Eastern theological tradition, it has often seemed strange to Western rational minds. The book argues that the transfiguration functions as an epiphany revealing Jesus' true identity and also an apocalyptic vision, depicting God's transforming future. A chapter is devoted to each of the four New Testament narratives of the transfiguration, setting the story within the wider literary and theological framework of the text. Traces of the transfiguration are examined in other parts of the New Testament, particularly in The Gospel of John, where the symbolism is close to that of the transfiguration. Finally, the author draws out the symbolism and theological implications of the transfiguration for an understanding of Christ, God's radical future and the transformation of all creation, drawing on the icons of Eastern Christianity and Western theologies of beauty. This book is a small masterpiece and a model of clarity and lucid exposition.	2005-09-27

Its publication now, in a new era of fear and violence, is particularly timely. On the one hand this book represents a passionate call to all Christians to embrace Jesus' ethic of peacemaking as an \\"unconditional, unlimited, and uncompromising\\" demand. But Nouwen goes on to show that peacemaking is more than a matter of carrying placards or opposing war. It must begin with a life of prayer, a movement from \\"the dwelling place\\" of fear and hatred and into the house of God. The next step is to \\"resist the powers of death\\"-not just in the form of armies and armaments, but in everyday selfishness and bondage to destructive consumer values. Finally we are called to celebrate life and to build communities in which love, forgiveness, and compassion bind us in solidarity with a wounded world. <br /> <br />	2005-09-27

This judgment, albeit controversial, constitutes the foundations of this project. The central danger of this crisis does not so much consist in the denial as in the banalization of God, whether as a fundamentally irrational claim of faith or at best as a purely regulative idea of reason. However, offering an account of the hope that is in us, and hence of the faith that gives rise to hope, requires on the part of Christian theology a rigorous intellectual effort, in short, the unfettered use of reason for the sake of faith in the God who is always greater than anything that can be thought. The point of such rigorous intellectual effort is not to offer a theological legitimization of reason as such, but rather to put reason to work theologically so that it comes genuinely to itself in realizing that God is and remains greater than anything that can be thought. Moreover, recognizing the limits and weaknesses of reason is possible only from a vantage point that deepens, broadens, and at the same time questions reason's horizon. Such a deepening, broadening, and questioning, however, always and only occurs reasonably, that is, through reason's own action. The program of the present volume is to inquire into the reasons of faith in order to offer theological resources to constructively address the double crisis of faith in reason and reason in faith. We inquire, first, into the theological constitution of reason; second, into reason as one specific faculty of human being; third, into the significance of the philosophical shifts of modernity for theology; and fourth, into the importance of philosophy for theological inquiry.

Instead of being a place where people serve and give, it has to find ways to renew, encourage, and bring them spiritual nourishment. People searching for meaning, souls on a spiritual quest, face the challenge of balancing their individual, inner life with the outward human need for companionship. In this book, the author offers churches the keys to addressing these two basic human needs: the need to flourish and the need for right relationship. Starting with the early church and relating the past to the present, she explains that people can only flourish inasmuch as engage in right relationship with others, which enables companions to flourish. Communities of eros are those that find ways to embody what Jesus means today, instead of simply talking about what he meant two thousand years ago. <br /> <br />	2005-09-23

This collection of manifestos, Supreme Court decisions, congressional testimonies, speeches, articles, book excerpts, pastoral letters, interviews, song lyrics, memoirs, and poems reflects the vitality, diversity, and changing nature of religious belief and practice in American public and private life over the last half century. Encompassing a range of perspectives, this book illustrates the ways in which individuals from all along the religious and political spectrum have engaged religion and viewed it as a crucial aspect of society. The anthology begins with documents that reflect the close relationship of religion, especially mainline Protestantism, to essential ideas undergirding Cold War America. Covering both the center and the margins of American religious life, this volume devotes extended attention to how issues of politics, race, gender, and sexuality have influenced the religious mainstream. A series of documents reflects the role of religion and theology in the civil rights, feminist, and gay rights movements as well as in conservative responses. Issues regarding religion and contemporary American culture are explored in documents about the rise of the evangelical movement and the religious right; the impact of \\"new\\" (post-1965) immigrant communities on the religious landscape; the popularity of alternative, New Age, and non-Western beliefs; and the relationship between religion and popular culture. The editors conclude with selections exploring major themes of American religious life at the millennium, including both conservative and New Age millennialism, as well as excerpts that speculate on the future of religion in the United States.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-23

The earliest extant commentary on the letter comes in thirty-four homilies from John Chrysostom. These homilies serve to anchor the excerpts chosen by the editors of this volume because of their unique place in the history of interpretation. In addition to being the first comprehensive commentary on the letter, they deeply influenced subsequent interpretation in both the East and the West, and their rhetorical eloquence has long been acknowledged. As in other Ancient Christian Commentary volumes, the excerpts chosen range widely over geography and time from Justin Martyr and Clement of Rome in the late first and early second century to The Venerable Bede, Isaac of Nineveh, Photius and John of Damascus in the eighth and ninth centuries. The Alexandrian tradition is well represented in Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Athanasius, Didymus and Cyril of Alexandria, while the Antiochene tradition is represented in Ephrem the Syrian, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Severian of Gabala and Theodoret of Cyr. Italy and North Africa in the West are represented by Ambrose, Cassiodorus and Augustine, while Constantinople, Asia Minor and Jerusalem in the East are represented by the Great Cappadocians-Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa-Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem and Jerome. <br /> <br />	2005-09-21

In the first volume that passage was fairly explicit because comprehensive ecclesiologies in a sense did not exist. In this volume ecclesiology itself becomes much more directly the subject matter of the book, but without losing sight of concrete history and the degree to which these ecclesiologies are historically conditioned. Put somewhat differently, the main goal of this \\"comparative ecclesiology\\" is not simply to lay down one after another different ecclesiologies that emerged over the last five hundred years, although that describes the book with empirical accuracy. Its larger intent is to show the richness, vitality, and creativity of the whole church as it moves through history, adjusting to new times, places, and cultures.	2005-09-21

Adapting aspects of conventional exegesis, he shows preachers how to lay out a plan for preparing to preach on a biblical theme. He considers possibilities for preaching on themes in connection with the Revised Common Lectionary and in sermon series based on free selection. Included are four sermon samples and an extensive appendix of resources for developing sermons on themes from the Bible. The author proposes preaching biblical themes in order to assist congregations to see and hear the diverse and faithful witness of God's people to God's activity in and intention for the world and the church. He provides significant help in how such preaching can be done through careful exegetical work and theological reflection. He suggests ways such preaching can be accomplished in the context of the church year and the lectionary. He also is clear in helping preachers avoid potential pitfalls in such preaching. This is an evocative and stimulating homiletical resource. <br /> <br />	2005-09-21

Moses' words were meant to equip God's people for living godly lives in a prosperous, pluralistic world. The cultural changes now taking place in the social settings make the parallel between Israel and the church-and what Deuteronomy has to say-both pertinent and instructive. This book offers a significant study of Deuteronomy that recovers this Scripture's vibrant message for the contemporary Christian community. Showing the major contribution that Deuteronomy makes to the understanding of the Bible as a whole, the author explores Deuteronomy's ethical teaching in the light of its most important theological themes: covenant, journey, law, the nations, and human nature. His perceptive analysis reveals the power with which Deuteronomy calls God's covenant people, from ancient Israelites to modern-day Christians, to hear God's voice. Whether read for its critical study of Scripture or for its practical insights into living faithfully today, this book will be a valuable resource for school, church, and home. <br /> <br />	2005-09-21

The author uncovers unique features of the prophecies of Hosea and Amos and discerns a structural unity within each book. This work compares Israel's distinctive religion with faith in Judah. The Northern Kingdom's theology is dominated by the wilderness wanderings and the Feast of Tabernacles. Israel has been worshipping Baal alongside Yahweh, and the prophets denounce the compromises, sin, shallow piety, and injustice of the people and their leaders.

Thus the Christ symbol must be reconstructed so that all who engage it may find it a source of human liberation. This present volume grew out of a Christology symposium at Creighton University in Omaha. Feminist theologians from a variety of church and cultural traditions met to grapple with the implications of considering a Christ who is in continuity with the Christian tradition but not in continuity with the white patriarchy that has pervaded the Christian tradition and shaped its symbolism. Each of the six contributors to the book critiques classical Christology and attempts a reconstruction of the Christ symbol in a way that would enrich the religious lives of contemporary believers. <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Seeking to critically reappropriate the Christian realism articulated by Niebuhr, she reinterprets solutions to problems emergent from his theology. She presents feminist Christian realism as an alternative that can reclaim a positive interpretation of divine transcendence and human self-transcendence, while maintaining newer emphases on human boundedness and divine immanence.

Many attempts to reclaim the female imagery for God in the Bible have foundered on the paucity of explicitly female images. However, the author seeks to reimagine the God who feeds, which traditionally has been regarded as gender neutral, in maternal terms. A metaphor of God's provision of food includes aspects of a mother's attentiveness, a mother's discipline and teaching, and a mother's household management. Biblical texts where an explicit connection between God's provision of food and nursing imagery are made to encourage such a reading, as they create a lingering association in the mind of the reader. The author provides reasonable alternatives to the stereotypical image of God drawing upon both the Old and New Testaments. <br />  <br />	2005-09-20

It is written as an open-ended quest for meaning in the form of a \\"theopoetics\\" rather than as a systematically developed argument. Weaving and circling around the Christian idea of woman, the book offers an unfolding vision of the problems and possibilities inherent in the story of Christ and the Church, with its historical legacy of silencing and exclusion and its unfulfilled promise of freedom and flourishing. The author concludes that woman is not a form of being but a way of becoming, a dynamic and unfolding discovery of self in relation to God, humanity, and nature which is always in process, never completed. From a Christian perspective, this project of becoming a sexed human being-man or woman-needs to be understood as part of a larger and more encompassing human vocation to become divine according to the orthodox concept of \\"theosis,\\" through the ongoing incarnation of God in Christ, the church, and the world.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Creative in his view that certain aspects of what is called suffering-loneliness, experience of limits, temptation, anxiety-are necessary parts of God's good creation. These he distinguishes from suffering after the fall, the tragic dimension of life. Unique is his structure: <br /> creation-suffering as becoming, <br /> the fall-suffering as a burden, and <br /> redemption-conquest from within. <br />The author succeeds in moving the reader beyond the customary way of stating the problem: \\"How can undeserved suffering coexist with a just and almighty God?\\" He also evaluates five popular, leading thinkers on suffering: Harold Kushner, C. S. Lewis, Diogenes Allen, George Buttrick, and Leslie Weatherhead. <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

Notable among the groundbreaking approaches the author adopts are <br /> the placement of the setting of the Gospel of Mark clearly within Greco-Roman culture, and <br /> the interpretation of the theological aim of the evangelist as a reaction to the challenge of that society.  <br />In particular, Mark's purpose is seen to be an opposition to the imperial claim to divinity and veneration, as he presents Jesus as the king who enters His kingdom by way of the cross. The vindication of Jesus in the resurrection is shown to be the divine approval on such an understanding of Jesus' mission and achievement.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-19

The ancient world struggled with the problem of marriage relationships, divorce, and support for women, in ways that largely determine the shape of Christian ethos.

Here, published together for the first time in a single volume, is a collection and analysis of representative rites in use in the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada. But the author begins not with the rites themselves. Rather, he focuses first on people's lives. For, as he says, \\"it is best to begin from the point of view of incarnation, people among us. So we start this inquiry with human faces, rather than a list of questions or a set of propositions.\\"  In beautifully drawn biographical vignettes, we meet two couples who are deeply committed Christians. One couple chose to celebrate their union with a liturgical rite, the other did not. With his customary clarity, the author then analyzes the liturgies, drawing upon his extensive scholarship and subtle historical insight. Complete texts of seven liturgies and two sermons are included. <br /> <br />	2005-09-16

For too long Mary was an icon for the repression of women by a male-dominated church, but now Mary is seen as a vital theological symbol reclaimed by women as a symbol of true humanity that the church and the modern world urgently needs. Jung has argued that the definition of the Doctrine of the Assumption was the most important religious event since the Reformation: the feminine principle has been absorbed into the Godhead. In this book, the author argues that Christian theology should conceive of the created order, both physical and spiritual, as sacred in the highest degree, and that this understanding is already implicit in traditions of Marian Doctrine and Devotion, far from being peripheral, this understanding of Mary is central to Christian doctrine. It must underlie any attempt to answer the fundamental ethical questions of the age, namely that of the extent to which human beings are entitled to intervene in the natural order.	2005-09-16

This book gives leading theological minds from North America, Great Britain, and Europe an opportunity to explore the shaping of their theological minds in regard to context and methodology. Asking \\"why theology,\\" each contributor explores their sense of call to the Christian faith, the purpose of their theological journey, and reflects on his or her context and theology. Cutting across denominational, gender, disciplinary, international, and generational boundaries to explore shifts in theology and methodology, this book provides a diagnostic tool for examining where theology has come from and a compass to where theology is headed. Contributors include: James H Cone, Edward Farley, Colin E Gunton, Alister E McGrath, Wayne A Meeks, John Milbank, Jrgen Moltmann, Gerald O'Collins, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Kathryn Tanner, Keith Ward, and John Webster.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-15

The book begins with an examination of women and the Bible, exploring biblical texts that define women negatively as well as those that emphasize women's strength and ability, and then outlining the various feminist approaches to Scripture. From here it moves to an overview of women in the history of Christianity and in American religion, presenting both prevailing attitudes about women and the (usually unheard) stories of women. After surveying the main questions a feminist method brings to the study of theology, the author then explores certain theological questions-How do we speak of God? Who is Christ? What does it mean to be human?-from a feminist perspective. Christian feminist theology is a rapidly expanding field of study from which many creative books have arisen. The intention of this volume is not so much to propose a new feminist theological construction as to interpret the existing feminist proposals for people who are beginning their study of feminism or theology. Both Christians and feminists have asked it it is possible to be at the same time a Christian and a feminist, the author asks the question a bit differently: Is it possible not to be? <br /> <br />	2005-09-15

Is prayer effective? Who was Jesus? It presents a way of thinking about Christian faith, and living the Christian life, that is a viable alternative to fundamentalism on the one hand and lukewarm liberalism on the other.

Peter empowers them to be communities of hope, not retaliating for abuse they suffer, but bearing witness to their Lord by word, lifestyle, and doing good. They also show how 2 Peter and Jude are relevant since the church still faces ethical compromises and pastoral dilemmas. The apocalyptic imagery stresses that the concerns of Christian faithfulness and faith are crucial. The church needs such moral exhortation. This is solid biblical exposition in a reader-friendly format. It offers careful and detailed analysis of these books in clear, accessible language and quotes Anabaptists working out understandings of faith under intense suffering. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

For the author, the mystery of God's ways and the appalling evil and suffering in the world are at the heart of Job's significant contribution to the canon of Scripture. This study offers a holistic reading of Job, with particular reference to its depiction of creation and evil, and finds significant clues to its meaning in the striking imagery it uses. The author takes seriously the literary and artistic integrity of the book of Job, as well as its theological profundity. He concludes that it is not so much about suffering per se as about creation, providence, and knowing God, and how-in the crucible of suffering-these are to be understood. He encourages readers to listen to this remarkable literature, to be moved by it, and to see its progress from shrieking protest to repentance and vision. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

A detailed examination of justification in the letter to the Romans is followed by a survey of the entire Pauline corpus. The analysis incorporates a critical assessment of the \\"new perspective,\\" challenging its most basic assumptions; an evaluation of the contribution of recent German scholarship; and a reaffirmation of the \\"Christ-centered\\" theology of the Reformers. In this wide-ranging exposition of the biblical message of justification, the author provides a fresh, balanced reworking of Pauline theology. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

He connects that story to the first-century world of its author and early readers. The commentary then shows how Matthew has shaped the church and still speaks to the life of the Christian community. Much of this presentation of Matthew was developed and tested in Christian education settings. The book helps readers wrestle with Jesus' gospel and mission, starting small, but for all nations.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

He argues that its emphasis falls upon sanctification as a definitive event, \\"God's way of taking possession of us in Christ, setting us apart to belong to him and to fulfill his purpose for us.\\" Simply to identify sanctification with growth in holiness, he contends, obscures the emphasis and balance of New Testament teaching and creates unrealistic expectations. Throughout the book, the author builds his case on the careful exegesis of relevant passages, with a keen eye for the pastoral implications of his findings. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

He blends thorough biblical scholarship with wisdom from extensive and varied experience in missionary work and bible teaching. Careful exposition is supplemented with literary and theological discussion. The key word in Acts is witness for Jesus Christ, from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. God's Spirit anoints the church at Pentecost, leads believers in handling conflicts between converts new and old, and empowers Christians to overcome false beliefs and magic. In Acts, Luke tells this dramatic story with subtle humor.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

Following Karl Jaspers, the author views all human knowledge as having limits beyond which there exists the transcendent. There are symbols, signs, and characters-or \\"ciphers\\"-that inhabit religion and art, and which point beyond these horizons. Perceiving these is at the heart of inspiration and the knowledge of God. For the author, the key to the question of inspiration and to the Bible lies with understanding the reader's encounter with these ciphers, the most supreme of which is Christ. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

Read as historical documents, these select homilies reveal the central preoccupations of his intellectual life, including his high sacramental theology and ecclesiology. But these works are also marked by the acute pastoral sense that made him beloved in his own day, and by his passionate desire that even the simplest of believers understand and embrace the life of Christian holiness. A substantial introductory essay by Maria Poggi Johnson sets his sermons in the context of Victorian religion, outlines the main themes of his thought, and suggests ways in which his homilies are relevant to contemporary Christians and students of religion.	2005-09-12

Outstanding as biblical scholar, preacher, and practical Church reformer, Calvin intended all his work to serve the Word of God. Although couched in sixteenth-century terms, his theology drew on the wealth of previous Christian thought and continues to be relevant to the situation of the Church today. This book is a comprehensive introduction to the whole range of Calvin's theology.

It takes forward modern revisionary scholarship, showing the slow emergence of the theologies that came to constitute pro-Nicene orthodoxy. Ancient heresiological categories, such as \\"Arian\\" and \\"Neo-Arian,\\" are avoided while the unity of \\"Nicene\\" theologies is not assumed. In the second part, the author offers a new account of the unity in diversity of late fourth-century pro-Nicene theologies. In particular he argues that the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed and the statements of unity and plurality in the Trinity to be found in all pro-Nicene theologians and in Theodosius' anti-heretical legislation were intended to be understood in the context of a broad set of theological practices and assumptions. He offers an account of the basic strategies that ground pro-Nicene theology, focusing on common epistemological concerns, a common notion of purification and sanctification, and a common aesthetics of faith. He also provides detailed introductions to the Trinitarian theology of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine of Hippo. Throughout the first two parts of the book a constant concern is to show that the common acceptance of a basic division between eastern and western Trinitarian theologies is unsustainable. Finally, the author considers the failure of modern Trinitarian theology to engage pro-Nicene theology in a substantial manner. Fundamental characteristics of the culture of modern systematic theology, especially the role of narrative and the influence of Hegel, prevent appreciation of the theological culture essential to pro-Nicene theology.	2005-08-29

He does so, however, with an eye toward the theological. No other introduction is tied so closely to the biblical texts. He asks, \\"What difference does the historical Jesus make in the understanding of the Gospels?\\" and, correspondingly, \\"What difference should this Jesus make in lives today?\\" By exploring in depth Jesus' words-the parables-and Jesus' deeds-miracles, he presents a holistic picture of Jesus that will explain how Jesus' followers would have understood his miracles and his role as prophet. With its accessibility and clear connections to what the Gospels are saying, this book is an excellent introduction for general readers and students.	2005-08-25

By offering a fresh understanding of the vulnerable child in the image of God, he presents a compelling reinterpretation of sin, church practice, and Christian witness in a world in which the threats to children's lives-poverty, child labor, war, and the sex trade-seem overwhelming.	2005-08-25

Revealing the diverse ways that the work of Michel Foucault (1926-1984) has been employed to rethink theology in terms of power, discourse, sexuality, and the politics of knowledge, the authors examine power and sexuality in the church in late antiquity (Castelli, Clark, Schuld), raise questions about the relationship between theology and politics (Bernauer, Leezenberg, Caputo), consider new challenges to the nature of theological knowledge in terms of Foucault's critical project (Flynn, Cutrofello, Beadoin, Pinto) and rethink theology in terms of Foucault's work on the history of sexuality (Carrette, Jordan, Mahon). This book demonstrates, for the first time, the influence and growing importance of Foucault's work for contemporary theology.	2005-08-15

Hence, John's vision in Revelation 21 is best understood as picturing the new heavens and earth as the eschatological temple. This stimulating exposition traces the theme of the tabernacle and temple along the Bible's story-line, also illuminating many texts and closely related themes. It shows how the significance and symbolism of the temple can be better understood in the light of contrasts to and similarities with the Ancient Near Eastern assumptions, and offers new insights into the meaning of the temple in both Old and New Testaments.	2005-08-10

Her probing narrative analysis challenges past portrayals of Sarah as the petulant and shortsighted wife of the founding patriarch of biblical tradition who so frequently stands as an obstacle to the establishment of the covenant between God and Abraham. Instead, the author argues that God chooses Sarah just as surely as Abraham, and that Sarah must be recognized for her key role in establishing the covenant between God and Israel. Her study has important implications for rethinking the role of women in relation to the understandings of biblical covenant in both Judaism and Christianity. <br /> <br />	2005-08-10

It takes various critical, ecclesial, and theological developments a significant step forward: reader response criticism, with its concern for real readers and their reading sites; basic communities, with their focus on community pairings and sustained interchange; and global Christianity, with its emphasis on intercultural exchange and a worldwide network of readers and groups.

In this book, the author makes a convincing case that canonical Philippians is as Paul wrote it, one letter. Although there is not enough specific evidence to \\"name names,\\" she suggests a number of possible audiences. A translation conforming as closely as possible to the original Greek is provided, along with a careful analysis of the language of the letter that yields insights into the context and theological underpinning of this epistle. The author argues that Philemon makes two specific appeals. The first seeks to elicit Philemon's partnership and his community's support in welcoming Onesimus back as both beloved brother and honored guest. The second requests that Onesimus be allowed to use the freedom he already has to serve Christ and his Gospel. In this commentary, the author provides a fresh translation, critical notes for each verse, and interpretation of defined sections.	2005-08-09
