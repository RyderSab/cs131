Katz's book is one of the best general works on the history of Mathematics around! <br />Its over-riding feature is that it is a TEXTBOOK - one that can be used for systematic study of the subject. Though tilted in favour of the mathematically inclined reader, the author has managed to connect the Maths to the History. The book has numerous topical exercises, sidebars and focus essays, which makes the subject easily accessible to the student. Yet, the structure and presentation are such that they also allow the book to be used simply as a reference or one that can be read purely for interest. Each chapter is followed by Exercises to assist the student to assess their learning and copious references that can be followed up for more details.<br />As with most good books of this genre, Mathematical developments from the last four centuries or so are most comprehensively presented. All the material is here: the &quot;tussle&quot; between Algebra and Geometry, the formal beginnings of the Calculus, the growth of Analysis, the development of new Mathematical techniques to tackle problems in Physics, and Probability mathematics.<br />The book places these developments within the socio-political context. Each chapter and main section starts with a preamble setting out the environment, the stimuli for the mathematical development to be discussed, etc. So, important events like the Renaissance, the French Revolution, etc. are discussed. In this regard, the use of Biography boxes for the main characters in the story of Mathematics helps to render the book more accessible to readers who may not be Mathematical. For instance, the chapter on Differential Equations would be inaccessible to the non-Mathematical reader were it not for such boxes retelling the lives and times of people like Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace.<br />The early chapters deal with Babylonian and Greek developments, the latter with well presented biographies of Aristotle, Plato, and Euclid, among others. The chapters on the mathematics of the Arabs is well balanced, whilst that on India and China is possibly the best I have seen in a &quot;mainstream&quot; work of this type. <br />Where other authors like Morris Kline have almost totally ignored the contributions of these cultures to the subject, Katz has done a fine job. To note a couple of examples: <br />(1) India as the rightful source of the decimal place value system;<BR>(2) Bhramagupta's research into what it usually known as Pell's equation, some 1000 years before Pell, and,<BR>(3) Madhava's derivation of the power series for the arcsine and his appreciation of convergence over 200 years before Gregory.<br />Overall, a very good book that, like Edna Kramer's work, adds to the accessibility of a stimulating subject that is at the heart of the intellectual development of mankind.	2004-05-01

Mr Burkill has produced a fine little book that gently guides the new student embarking on a specialism in Maths. The author has struck a good balance between the problem solving so familiar at school and introducing the rigour of Mathematical Analysis.<br />Familiar concepts like differentiation and integration are brought into play right after a quick refresher on numbers and then introducing the notion of limit within the framework of sequences. The delta-epsilon construct is used to great effect to give meaning to the ideas of convergence of sequences and the continuity of functions.<br />These then lead naturally to the Differential calculus where previously learnt ideas like the rules of differentiation are placed in a rigorous setting and interesting elementary analytical results such as the Mean Value Theorem and Taylor's theorem are discussed. The chapter on Infinite series together with the elementary rules for testing for convergence is followed by a chapter on the special functions of analysis as defined in terms of series - e.g. exp, log, sin, cos, etc.<br />The chapter on the Integral Calculus makes a natural next step utilising the ideas of an integral as a limit and of infinite series. Specific techniques such as the integral to infinity and approximation methods are placed on a rigorous footing. The final chapter introduces functions of several variables.<br />The book has lots of worked examples within the text, which aid understanding of new material. As a bonus, there are also several end of section with notes/hints at the end of the book.<br />Overall, this is a gentle introduction to Analysis and will help anyone who is overawed by the subject on first encounter.encounter.	2004-04-26

Leaves the reader somewhat disappointed.<br />I picked up this book with great expectations, having read the publisher's publicity. To be frank, I was left disappointed. The book tells the reader very little about the wonderful and mysterious character of the Riemann hypothesis and leaves both mathematical novices and those who know about the intricacies of higher Mathematics dissatisfied. This is indeed a pity!<br />Having said this, Mr Sabbagh's story is eminently readable and  enlightening. The book has many sections that are in effect a diary of the conversations with various Mathematicians. These give an insight into the thought processes, passions, motivations, and rivalries that exist in the select community of Number Theorists. The pen portraits of the main protagonists is quite interesting even though it sheds little light on the character of the Riemann hypothesis and how it enthrals those working on its proof. <br />The toolkits covering a set of brief synopsis of Infinite series and the Euler identity should be useful to the lay (but Mathematically capable) reader, but the appendix on the De Brandes proof is rather obscure. <br />Overall, an OK book if the reader wants a gentle introduction to the subject and act clever in passing conversation at parties, but, sadly, this book fails to educate and enlighten in the real sense!	2004-01-04

Edna Kramer's is perhaps the best of the genre of books on the History of Mathematics.<br />The most pleasing feature about this book is that it is a fine balance between the mathematical ideas and the lives of the mathematicians. Best of all, it paints a sympathetic history of the times in which the discoveries were made. The use of anecdotes and \\"little\\" events in the lives of the men and women really brings to life both the subjects and their work.<br />Although my particular favourite sections are on the achievements of Euler, Gauss, Lagrange, d'Alambert, Ricci, Levi Civita, and Riemann, the book is truly an expansive landscape - there is coverage of virtually all the greats from the 16th century onwards. There are numerous examples from which to learn the basics of the mathematics. For instance, the sections on the history of the calculus are interwoven with simple, yet lucid examples. Equally, the more complex ideas like integral equations and partial differential equations are illustrated by examples drawn from the physical world. <br />All this makes the book worthwhile - it DOES NOT skirt over the Mathematics, but rather, makes an active attempt at imparting knowledge and understanding. This makes the book ideal for both the Maths specialist who is interested in history and for the generalist seeking a broad understanding without being daunted by the Maths. Kramer has done a marvellous job in meeting this tough challenge.<br />If this book has one failing, it is the way it skims over mathematical contributions from non-western societies, but it balances this somewhat by not overplaying the \\"Greek card\\". Some books do go on about Euclid as if he was the Newton of the ancients! Having said this, it can be excused since the book is quite old and much new knowledge has been gained on contributions from India and China in the last couple of decades. The interested reader may also wish to look up George Joseph's book, \\"The flight of the Peacock\\" for this. <br />An ideal book for both history and mathematics. I have had my copy for 20 years and it keeps my interest, still. Thoroughly recommended!	2003-11-11

Starting with Lorentz' papers on Michelson's interference experiment and electomagnetic phenomena in moving frames of reference, the book follows the rapid development of the subject from Einstein's ground breaking papers of 1905 on Electrodymanics and Inertia. Minkowski's original paper on Space-Time is a delight: it's always a pleasant surprise when one finds that the explanation of the originator has not been bettered in nearly 100 years!<br />Latter chapters of the book present Einstein's papers on General Relativity -which are mathematically complex. They are definately not the place to start if one wants to learn the principles of General Relativity. Nonetheless, after one has learnt the principles from more accessible materials, such as &quot;The Principles of Cosmology and Gravitation&quot; by M V Berry, these papers can be very useful as original sources that the reader can use in order to grasp the methods by which Einstein presented his revolutionary discoveries.<br />This is an excellent, high value, low cost source that is worth keeping!	2003-07-17

It is an excellent antidote to some of the glossy and expensively packeged books by &quot;pop&quot; writers and TV programmes. <br />As the introduction of the book makes clear, the authors aim for a wide audience for whom Cosmology is not a core discipline. Not only do they do a good job in meeting this goal, but they also present the physical concepts and experimental results in a way that provides new and deep insights to those whose main interest is Physics. For instance, the discussion of the Big Bang and the cosmic models provides an excellent complement to the mathematical presentation of authors like M.V. Berry. Equally, there is a plethora of material that describes experimental results like those for General Relativity: bending of light under the infulence of the sun's gravity, the Eotovos experiment to demonstrate the Equivalence Principle, etc.<br />The book covers a broad field: Some historical aspects, Special and General Relativity, the Big Bang and various cosmic models, dark matter, and large scale structure.<br />The glossary and the authors' web site provide further information on the subject.	2003-07-17

It was first published in 1902 and the fact that it is still in print is testimony to it's wide ranging utility and appeal.<br />It should be noted that this text is not for those who are new to the rigour of Analysis; its presentation is suitable for a final year undergraduate or for the post-graduate student. More importantly, its wide ranging content of proofs and results would also prove useful to the Physicist.<br />The first part of the book covers the &quot;essentials&quot; of analysis: continuity, differentiability, summation of series, convergence and uniform convergence, and the theory of the Riemann integral. Subsequent chapters quickly but comprehensively develop the theory of analytic functions, the theorems of Cauchy, Laurent, and Liouville and the calculus of residues. These chapters knit very well into the earlier presentation of the basic processes of analysis! The pleasing thing is that despite the passage of time and the advent of hundreds of books on Complex Variable Theory, Whittaker and Watson's treatment still bears a mark of freshness and rigour.<br />Also included is a comprehensive treatment of expanding functions in infinite series and asymptotic expansions and summability of series. For completeness, the text also covers the theory of linear differential equations and Fourier series. <br />The second part of the book is what stands it apart from the rest. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of the major transcendental functions: Gamma, Zeta, Hypergeometric, Legendre, and Bessel to name the more commonly encountered ones. The treatment is rigorous but the copious number of examples provides opportunity to learn the theory and apply it. Lots of apparently obscure results, many that would be useful in Physics applications, are cited as examples.<br />The latter chapters presents a treatment of Elliptic, Theta and Mathieu functions. <br />Overall, Whittaker and Watson will continue to be the guiding light for any serious scholar of classical analysis and an excellent reference point for the solutions to the fundamental equations of Mathematical Physics. Even though I am not a practising Mathematician, I find this a pleasant book to dip into: there's always a little surprise and something new to learn. <br />This book will live forever!	2003-07-16

A constant connection with classical physics principles;<BR>2. An early introduction to and development of the wave packet and operators and a physical interpretation of Schrodinger's equation;<BR>3. A comprehensive discussion of various QM models in both their mathematical and physical aspects: the infinite well and other 1-D potentials, SHO, scattering;<BR>4. Two-D and Three-D QM and the development of the Hydrogen atom;<BR>5. Development of Gravity and QM;<BR>6. An abundance of examples, many based on experimental results for the student to try out.<br />The mathematics is clear, and unlike many other books, the author takes the trouble to present many of the intermediate steps. I should say, however, that there are quite a few TYPOS sprinkled throughout the text. They are only a minor distraction and if anything, finding and fixing them can be a useful learning experience! My criticsm would be that the sections on the physical and mathematical development of Spin is too short. Indeed, the Stern-Gerlach and associated gedanken experiments which are so fundamental to an understanding of the postulates of QM do not get much of a mention.<br />Having said this, the book is certainly a good introduction to the subject. It complements other traditional texts like French and Taylor quite well.	2003-07-11

Arun Shourie is once more at his cutting best in this exposé of the devious ways in which the cabal of \\"Eminent Historians\\" manipulate, massage, and murder History with all their undertones of Marxist ideology, masquerading a shabby brand of secularism.<br />Here you will find the excesses of such \\"eminences\\" as Romila Thappar, Satish Chandra, Irfaan Habib, R S Sharma, and an assortment of fellow travellers. A veritable brood who have cornered the writing of History as seen though their own warped, pinko tinted spectacles. And for this \\"service\\" to scholarship, the brood has lost no opportunity to monopolise state largess, siphon off grants for various projects without delivering. The few times this pretend-busy brood has deigned to deliver, then the output of any \\"research\\" has been so immersed in the ideology prescribed by some foreign, totalitarian, failed Party and State, that it defies the description of scholarship.<br />No wonder that none of the eminences or their intellectual offspring have had the guts to respond to the issues that Shourie raises here. They deploy the same strategy as they do in their historical \\"researches\\" - first ignore it, then decry it as petty, from an amateur, hurl personal insults, falsify facts. <br />Remember: these \\"eminences\\" have made a career out of claiming that Aurangzeb was a just ruler, that the Caste System was the sole reason for India's problems, that Islam brought equality, that the systematic destruction of countless temples was an economic exercise and had absolutely nothing to do with the hatred and contempt that the Islamic invaders had for Indian culture and traditions.<br />For \\"eminences\\" who deny the history as written by the chroniclers themselves of the invasions, of pillage, of destruction, of the rape that they carried out in honour of their iconoclasm, it is easy to falsify even recent history like the events around partition; like the Ramjanambhoomi dispute; like Secularism and minority rights.<br />Shourie's book is an excellent antidote to the .... from these eminences that still passes off as \\"academic research\\". It is shameful that the likes of Thappar still warrant respect in the academic community. But, the good news is that their time is nigh! Shourie and others like him are making sure of it.	2002-12-31

G H Hardy's book is the pioneer in the field of introducing the formal and rigorous principles of Mathematical Analysis. By Hardy's own admission, the book sprang from the void that existed prior to its publication in 1907.<br />In a word, the hallmark of this book is &quot;style&quot;, and Hardy must be the original style guru as far as Pure Mathematics goes. <br />The book covers all the essential elements one would expect to see in an introductory course in the subject, namely the notion of a limit and its application to sequences, series, a comprehensive yet elementary exposition of convergence and its use in the definition of functions, differentiation and integration. All of the main theorems of the calculus of the real variable are covered. The latter chapters address the general theory of logarithmic, exponential and circular functions.<br />Despite the glut of books on the subject of Real Analysis that are on the market, and there are some VERY GOOD ones, this is the classic text that every serious student of Pure Mathematics should begin with. Texts with more general coverage of real analysis such as Tom Apostol's Mathematical Analysis can follow thereafter.<br />This book is nearly 100 years old.

However, it has the added utility in that, given the broad range of subjects covered, there will be plenty here both for second and third year students as well as for the interested reader in the sixth form.<br />Subjects covered include: Classical Dynamics, Gravitation, Special Relativity, Optics, Electromagnetism and circuits, and Thermodynamics. The author has also included problems on Dimensions and basic Statistics as applied to experimental Physics.<br />What I like best about this book is that you can &quot;dip into it at will&quot; and find something of interest.

However, this book does not sit easily in a series designed to make a subject approachable to the novice. It has far too much esoteric maths than is good for a book of this genre.

The Maths is kept to the necessary minimum, and several \\"rough\\" calculations are given to show the relevance of the models to observation.<br />The problems at the end of the chapters together with hints help to underpin the physical concepts covered.

Admittedly, the subject of this book is not my area, so I may be talking out of turn.<br />So, my criticisms? The book is written in a rather stilted style. The words do not flow easily, but, worse, the mathematical ideas also assume a lot of the reader. A proof could be presented in a couple of simple lines, but when you dig further, it assumes some intermediate steps. Even simple concepts like operations with Turing machines are made obtuse. What a contrast, with Roger Penrose, who gives a lucid explanation in his \\"The Emperor's New Mind\\"!<br />The sections on Logic are equally obscure, and extremely boring in their presentation.

A very good text!<br />The best description of this book is that it provides a comprehensive, classical treatment of the subject with a modern touch and serves ideally the needs of anyone studying Complex Analysis.<br />Starting from the foundations of defining a complex number, through to applications in the evaluation of integrals, the WKB method, Fourier transforms and Riemann-Hilbert problems, the book covers a lot of ground in an easy to follow style. The chapters are long, but logically broken down into digestible sections and interspersed with well illustrated diagrams, numerous worked examples and exercises.  The end of chapter exercises provide further opportunity for reinforcing the methods and there's a useful section at the end giving brief hints and answers to selected problems.<br />Complex Variable analysis is treated from the definition of an analytic function and its relation to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and in turn their application to an ideal fluid flow. The ideas of multi-valued functions, complex integration, and Cauchy's theorem are excellently treated, as are the consequences: the generalised Cauchy integral formula, the Max-Mod principle, and Liouiville and Morera's theorems.  <br />The rest of the first part of this book, which is essentially pure mathematics, deals with Laurent series, singularities, analytic continuation, the Mittag-Leffler theorem, the ALL IMPORTANT Cauchy Residue Theorem, dealing with branch points, Rouche's theorem, and their application to Fourier transforms.<br />The second half starts off with perhaps the best I have seen on Conformal Mappings and their application to physical problems in Fluid Mechanics and Electromagnetism.  Asymptotic evaluation of integrals covers methods like Watson's lemma, the method of steepest descent, and the WKB method.<br />A good combination of pure and applied mathematics, though the book avoids either the rigour of classical works such as Whittaker and Watson or the marvellously visual presentation of Tristan Needham. <br />Highly recommended!	2002-11-29

For all that, it still does the core things excellently: namely focus on the Physics, the experiments, the theory, AND the people behind the advances.<br />After going through the antecedents of the classical atomic model, the authors quickly move onto the wave-particle duality. They describe, throughout, groundbreaking experimental work of the likes of Thompson and Davisson &amp; Germer. After setting the foundations, French and Taylor go to the discussion of the one dimensional Schrodinger equation, its physical meaning, and several examples of solutions by means of qualitative plots.<br />Photons and Quantum States, Angular momentum, Atomic Systems, a detailed discussion of the Hydrogen atom and Radiation from atoms make up the rest of the book.<br />What I particularly like about this book is that it is grounded in the Physics, with experiment and theory given an equal footing. The authors are gentle with their use of mathematics. The concept of operators is applied to the physical problem.

From humble beginnings in the small town of Kumbhakaon in Tamil Nadu to the hallowed cloisters of Trinity College, Cambridge, this magnificent book narrates the story of Ramanujan's trails, tribulations and triumphs.<br />Central to the story are the powerful influences of Ramanujan's mother and the great English Mathematician, Godfrey Harold Hardy. If his mother, Komala shaped the first part of Ramanujan's life, then surely Hardy must take full credit for bringing Ramanujan's prodigious talents to the attention of the world Mathematical community. Other prominent characters also figure in the story - notably Ramanujan's many friends, Narayana Aiyer, Gopalachari, leading lights in the Indian Mathematical establishment, members of the ruling British classes, Sir Francis Spring, the Governor of Madras Presidency, and Cambridge Mathematicians, Neville and Littlewood.<br />The book presents a touching portrait of Ramanujan the man: an orthodox Vaishav Bhraman, steeped in Hindu culture with all the attendant characteristics of a deeply spiritual outlook, a calm self-assurance about his abilities, and most of all, an obsession with Mathematics. Hardy, his mentor, is also biographed as the passionately atheist, Winchester educated son of a middle class schoolmaster who went up to Cambridge, and at the turn of the 20th century, almost single handed masterminded the rise of English Pure Mathematics.	2002-11-26

This is a great book on the life and Complex Variable Analysis work of Augustine Cauchy.<br />Smithies brings many of the quaint, yet pertinent pieces that comprise the rich field called Complex Variables together into a mathematical jigsaw. I for one was fascinated to see the link between the CR Equations and Green's Theorem.<br />Using copious examples, directly from Cauchy's published as well as unpublished notes, Smithies enlightens the reader of the genius of Cauchy. To the reader versed in modern representation of Complex Variable theory, Smithies insistence on sticking to Cauchy's formulation of complex functions in real terms and then using his method of separation may seem laborious at first, but it rewards the reader by giving deep insight into Cauchy's thought processes.<br />The book covers a wide field of Complex Variables from the formulation of Cauchy's Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Formula, the Residue Theorem and Integrals between imaginary limits.<br />Remarkable though his work was, the book shows the almost insular nature of Cauchy - by sometimes never publishing his results and being either unaware or disdainful of other results, e.g. d':Alembert, Gauss, Euler, etc.<br />A good book to read as an accompaniment to a standard text on Complex Variables (e.g. Ablowitz and Fokas).

Many authors quote Azad as if his relating of events were a true and complete record. This has done great damage to many of the main players in the Independence struggle, notably, Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad.<br />Rajmohan Gandhi, in this short yet incisive book, meticulously presents evidence that correct much abused and misguided notions as:<br />* The Congress terms of acceptance of partition, in particular those for the common assets and of the armed forces do not tally with Azad's account;<br />* The sectarian bias in Azad's book in relation to Prasad and Patel are refuted with REAL evidence from historical sources;<br />* Azad's machinations during the war years which resulted in his holding on to the Congress presidency and his manoeuvres to use this as a platform for the Prime Ministership of independent India;<br />* Exposure of Azad's pathetic excuse for Jinnah's bloody &quot;Direct Action&quot; in 1946;<br />There are plenty of others. It would be good if the so called &quot;professional historians&quot; at JNU would take note and revise the pack of lies they have been peddling all these years. Somehow, one doubts that they have the courage or the academic integrity to do so.<br />Thanks, Mr Rajmohan Gandhi. We need more journalists like you to present History as it happened.	2001-05-13

Imagine, if you will...Romila writing a History of Europe from the 15th to the 19th Centuries. The book would be a marvel of fiction, centering on a litany of the ills that the supposedly &quot;high caste&quot; Church imposed on its subjects. The rigid Church hierarchy imposed a strict code, the breaking of which led to being &quot;out casted&quot;. Then, along comes a reforming hero, in the shape of Henry the Eighth and takes on the enemy in true cavalier fashion. Meanwhile, according to Thappar, the innovators of the steam engine, of the principles of Industrial Engineering, of sea navigation, of scientific discoveries would be no better than the religious masters. They too subjugate the common people, forcing them to all kind of heinous things like improving production, advancing mobility, creating wealth, etc. The people's response is to fight back! They turn to a reforming and egalitarian Religion called Communism.<br />On could go on...<br />The gist is simple: replace the Church with the Bhramins, Henry with any of the Hindu saints, the innovators and inventors with the hard working and civilised people of India, and Communism with the marauding hordes of Ghaznavi, Tughluq, and Babur. And Voila! You have Indian History a la Thappar.<br />In short, if you want a HEAVY dose of discredited Marxist propaganda, conviniently couched in &quot;pseudo-secularist&quot; babble, take this book or other from the JNU stable seriously! Else, look elsewhere. From the four and five star ratings in this section, it is clear that some misguided college teachers still consider this trash worth using in class. It will take years to undo the damage Thappar and her band have done to Scholarship.<br />There's plenty of good alternative stuff in the bookshop - seek it out!	2001-03-16

The translation dates to 1920 and new readers may find the English a little quaint, but for all that, it is a great effort at presenting in \\"plain speak\\", the concepts of Relativity.<br />The book starts with a lucid explanation of the Train and Platform example of Galelian Relativity and then proceeds to highlight the incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light.  Without encumbering the reader with the Maths (found in the appendices) the ideas of time dilation and length contraction are discussed. The General Theory is developed via a fine example: that of an observer on a rotating disk.<br />This is a good complement to the overtly scientific/mathmatical books on the subject. Unfortunately,, despite its many qualities, just like many of the alternatives of this genre, Einstein's book does not fully succeed in explaining the complex concepts to the lay reader.  Rather, this is a nice little book that will be suitable for a good calibre Maths/Physics student in the sixth form/high school.	2001-03-09

Arun Shourie is the scourge of the \\"progressive\\"Indians who parade their Marxist ideologies under the guise of \\"historical\\" and \\"social science\\" reasearch.<br />In this book, he exposes fully the narrow minded world of the Mullahs who rule the roost in Islam. Whilst the FATWA is now infamous for its severe impact on Slaman Rushdie, the world knows little of how much these \\"religious\\" edicts govern the humdrum lives of ordinary Muslims. <br />Shourie discusses at length some quite hilarious and often crass cases that the Muslim clergy give direction on. For instance, (a) a mouse falls in water, is the water OK to drink? or can it be used to wash? What if it was a fly in butter? (b) a she goat has been abused by a man, is the meat of this goat Halal (like Kosher)? (c) under what circumstances can a man remarry a woman after he has divorced her? (d) if a man says \\"Talaaq, Talaaq, Talaaq\\" three times to his wife, is this form of divorce irrevocable? etc. Shourie also goes on to expose the narrow, sectarian, male dominated ideologies that drive these law makers. <br />This is the height of Philosophical discourse to which the intellectuals of Islam rise. The book is excellently researched in that it makes copious use of original references from the Islamic catalogue of \\"religious literature\\". Admittedly, the focus is on the Islamic ideology of the various schools of thought (surely a misnomer) of the Indian Subcontinent, but then no one in the rest of the Islamic world has come forward to say that this literature is not representative. Even more serious is the vitriol and venom that the various Islamic groups pour on each other. This is only exceeded by their utter contempt for the \\"unbelievers\\". This is an excellent book - it is a MUST READ, especially in conjuntion with Ibn Waraaq's \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\".<br />Readers should look forward to the the \\"progressive\\" followers of Indian Social Science and History - like Romila Thappar, Irfan Habib, Bipan Chandra, to namea few, to step forward and decry this book as \\"the rantings of a Hindu fascist\\" The fact is that these people do not have a leg to stand on. More pertinently, the \\"intellectuals\\" of the \\"true faith\\" are silent on the matter too; surely that speaks volumes for the integrity and accuracy of Shourie's research.<br />Well done Arun Shourie.

Mr. Rajaram has done an excellent job with what is a highly emotive and contentious subject. He brings the best aspects of the scientific method, dwelling on objective and holistic inquiry through the collection and  analysis of evidence from multiple fields. The result is a book that  cruelly exposes the charades that have been played at the expense of  getting to the facts, all in the name of political ideologies, initially of  European racial superiority and lately, of class based Marxism.<br />Rajaram's  book should be compulsory reading for all students of History, wherever  they may be. It certainly poses a number of questions that the so called  professional historians of India can no longer duck and weave around.  Perhaps the doyens of that dustbin of history, the Jawaharlal Nehru  University in Delhi, can take some steps to answer the charges against  them. Would Romila Thappar like to take on this challenge? Somehow, I do  not think so! Sadly, she has hardly progressed from the narrow philological  views of Muller et al of over a century ago. <br />Well done Mr. Rajaram.	1999-09-13

For several years, he was a correspondent for the French Daily paper, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, based in Delhi, India. In this book, Gautier  has succeeded in laying many deep rooted misconceptions about India well  and truly to rest. Of especial note is that this work was inspired as an  antidote to Basham's book: &quot;The wonder that was India&quot;. He brings  a refreshing yet inquisitive journalistic style to his writing and  convinces the reader that &quot;India IS great&quot;!<br />Gautier spans a  panorama covering ancient as well as modern India; he poignantly dissects  the mythical status accorded to Gandhi - how can a disciple of peace have  as his &quot;inspiration&quot; the Bhagwad Gita, a &quot;War Manual&quot;  espousing the principles of divine morality and &quot;Dharma&quot;? Also,  how is it that a determined campaigner for independence and democracy dared  to hand the governance of a party or country on the sole basis of his own  personal whims? Readers will know of the Gandhi inspired fiascos that led  to Nehru supplanting Bose as Congress President and also the unilateral  offer of the Prime Ministership of India to Jinnah!<br />He also succinctly  puts the shambolic policy of secularism truly in its place. Reading  Gautier, one quickly realsies that secularism is at best a front to  perpetuate the imagined prejudices against &quot;minortites&quot; and at  worst a license to promote defunct marxist ideologies. In this respect,  Gautier is quick to point out the rank duplicity of Nehru in creating  within India the divisive and class ridden structures within government and  education that plod on, in the manner of the living undead, even to this  day.<br />Of course, the size of the book exposes it to gaps. For one,  Gautier's exposition on the Sikhs is a little lightweight. Fundamental  issues like the capitulation of the Congress to Pakistan's claim to the  lion's share of the Sikhs traditional lands in the Punjab do not even get a  mention. Neither is there any mention of the ethnic cleansing (kept quiet  from the world) in what is now Pakistani Punjab! Contrast this with the  multi-religious character of India which still attracts the pious and  perverted fulminations of the secularist brigade.<br />For all this, Gautier  has to be commended; he obviously has a deep understanding of India (unlike  so many European correspondents) and brings this to bear in his writing. He  is obviously a fan of Sri Aurobindo, making copious references to his ideas  and works.	1999-05-04

Rajaram and Frawley have produced an excellent, well researched set of arguments against the long (and now increasingly tenuous) view that &quot;aryans&quot; invaded India and destroyed the &quot;dravidian&quot;  (i.e. Harappan-Saraswati) civilization. <br />The authors have used their  innate belief in the &quot;Scientific Method&quot; and their knowledge of  Sanskrit literature (does Thappar know Sanskrit???) and Mathematics to tell  a story full of insight. They make extensive use of the most contemporary  results from research in Archeology, Geo Satellite imaging, Mathematics,  and linguistics and combine these with a holistic approach to historical  research. The result is a short, yet telling book, that sheds light on  important inter-relationships between the ancient cultures of the Nile  valley, Mesopotamia and India. The origins of a lot of humanity's culture  are unfolded in the process! The mode of argument is, if anything, careful,  methodical and devoid of arrogance. It is indeed refreshing to read History  without the political baggage!<br />Readers may wish to compare the output  from established historians like Thappar, who has, in a career spanning 40  or more years has done little than to parrot the fallacies of Muller and  other Eurocentric writers from the pre-scientific age. To think that such  rubbish is still taught in Indian Schools! Even my 11 year old's class  would not be allowed to buy into such unsubstantiated stuff as Thappar  produces! Unlike Rajaram &amp; Frawley, poor Romila Thappar, in her book,  History of India Vol. 1, starts off by criticizing those who split Indian  History into the Hindu, Mozlem and British eras, but then she spends the  remaining pages making all types of communist inspired generalisations and  accusations about the the &quot;Bhramanical&quot; caste system (who are  these &quot;Bhramans&quot;??? and is there a Freudian condition for  Thappar's fixation about caste?)whilst ignoring the 1000 year long  systematic ethnic cleansing perpetrated by mozlem invaders! (Note the  contrast, Thappar has few feelings and even less opinions on the so called  divine injunctions agianst non-believers in semetic religions!) A revision  of history is necessary, not only for Indians self awareness, but also to  more cogently confront the injustices in other parts of the world  today.<br />Rajaram and Frawley lead the way as far as applying the scientific  method to history is concerned - they dilligently look for evidence from  multiple sources, re-visit original sources, avoid generalisations and  prejudices and stick to evidence, analyse it, synthesize it and draw  conclusions!<br />The authors deserve credit for showing that one does not  have to be a &quot;Professional Historian&quot; to do excellent,  comprehensive research. It would seem that for good objective history,  especially in the case of the Non-European world, one has to look to  subject experts outside of university history departments! Does this  explain the parlous state of history departments in Universities around the  globe???<br />Bravo!	1999-04-28
