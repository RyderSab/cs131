One of those books that are written in a \\"true voice\\" that makes you feel like you are right there at the kitchen table with the characters. I do love Elizabeth Berg books and this didn't disappoint. A rich story about a woman that is going through a painful divorce, this book touches on many emotional levels. Not only are there family members to deal with, but there are plenty of quirky ones as well. The girl \\"Lavender Blue\\" that lives in the basement is such a metaphor for the lost and aimless in love. PS-- I'm glad I got the \\"Oprah\\" edition because of the interview with Berg in the back.	2005-08-28

I just finished this book and had to come down and write a review while it was fresh in my mind. This story is so honest, so painful that it's hard to turn each page. That said, it's also one of the most poignant reads I've ever had. I don't think it's only for heavy people to read either; it's for anyone who wants a glimpse into someone's brutal childhood who lived to tell the tale. At times, I wanted to scoop the author up and give her a mighty hug and tell her everything was going to be okay. Other times I really wanted to seek her family out and beat the crap out of them. Sometimes I wanted to eat while reading, especially the wonderful pies she's described in the text.<br /><br />Haunting and wonderful, this story will stay with you for a long, long time.	2005-08-13

I admit I'm an Elizabeth Berg fan, and that I've read her previous novels in this 'series' about Katie Nash. I did find this book to be the best however, and I think it's because I identified the most with the age that Katie appears in this book. I remember being 13 like it was yesterday. <br /> What an awkward age for any kid, and Katie has had her share of sorrow. Instead of going gloomily through life however, she has a poet's heart and mind for words. The interactions between stepmother and father are also woven in a way of magic, and it's interesting to watch their relationship unfold. Katie finds out you can't go home, but in the process gains a new understanding for a friend she thought was something more glamorous than she really was. There are funny parts (girl scout sleep over in the livingroom) that leave you wanting more and also those true to life betrayals we've all made and wish we could take back. I could almost feel Katie's heartbeats as she told her secrets to the popular girls. <br />Great book, you won't be disappointed. The only thing I can say is I wish these stories were longer. They end way too quickly!	2005-08-05

I have used the book with teachers and parents to explain the effects of medication (mostly for ADHD) on their children. It also lists the half-lives (how long the meds stay in the system) of many drugs used for ADHD, which is of primary concern to many people. Great research done on the success rates as well.	2005-07-07

I wait for her books with baited breath and actually read them very slowly because I don't want them to end. This did not disappoint. <br />Set in England on the Gurnesy coast, I learned quite a bit about the Nazi occupation in that area (who knew?!). As with all of her books I find there are way too many characters to keep up with at first until, as if by magic, they all come together in one glorious thread. Loved the characters, loved the fact that it was involved with Simon and Deborah and really was surprised by the ending. If you're already a fan, this book should prove it's weight in gold. If not, it's not a bad place to start!  <br />	2005-07-01

Read it all at once, or dip into it now and again. Ms Vogel gets inside \\"Old Hollywood\\" for a look at the children of stars that were involved in the Hollywood contract system. Photo shoots and \\"pretending\\" to be the perfect family was the norm back then. Quite different than today's stars who try to sheild their children from the spotlight. Hollywood and movie studios were more than happy to use the actor's family as almost a \\"prop\\" at times. I've read quite a few books in this subject but this one was very different in the subject studies. Good book to take to the beach when you just want a quick read on a chapter or two!	2005-05-17

I'll make sure to go and read her first book asap! I found \\"The Little Friend\\" to be a wonderful story--rich in characters and deep in southern mystery. I found myself getting up in the night to read more, something I certainly don't do with every book. The conflicting pain Harriet feels about the blacks and even poor whites seems more real because it's told from a young girl's point of view. The use of the snakes (and even the meth labs and addiction) was an eerie touch. I even wanted to jump ahead to see what was going to happen. Loved the Aunts and the character of Edie. Harriet's house, piled high in clutter comes off the pages like a rotting southern dream.  <br />I can't speak to some of the reviews and their comments about rascism because I didn't get that feel from the book. The story itself is what it is; and I think it was wonderful.	2005-04-23

I hardly ever read a political book. This review is for all of you that probably would never pick one up if it was the last thing on the shelf. I took a chance because a relative of mine recommended it after hearing my views on the state of affairs and the Iraqi war. <br />I am so glad he did. I don't think I've ever agreed with Mr Buchanan on just about any point. This book is amazing in it's insightfulness to not only present day politics but the history behind it all. While other's charge this admin or that admin for blunders in the past, he concentrates on an idiology and movement which transends political parties.  <br />Understanding that our American policies shape how the world views us is not new--however I feel that it's a message many need to hear at this time. Nothing is as clear cut as Good vs Evil or \\"hate\\" vs acceptance. This book does a great job at laying out the present course we've set in motion. <br />I really recommend this to anyone reading about the lead up to the war and trying to make sense of the direction we need to be heading for the future.	2004-09-05

I have been hesitant to recommend this book to friends because of it's sexual content and that's really a shame. It's something I've decided to get over because this book is just awesome. I personally have never read such a wonderful, complex and beautifully written 'murder mystery' before. The characters are so well developed and so true to &quot;High School&quot; life it can make you cringe inside. I picked this book up on a whim at the library, not knowing what to expect at all and am so glad I did.

My brother actually bought it and when I looked on the publishing page, I found it's a first edition. I do believe it will become a classic one day.<br />Billed as a tale of the &quot;homeless&quot; I found it much more an adult type &quot;Holes&quot;--a magical story that weaves it's way through time, bringing us to a finale that's intertwined with the beginning. It's also a facinating look at the building of the train tunnels between Manhattan and Brooklyn and the men who toiled underground, now largely forgotten. I especially loved the way history repeated itself through time and space, making the tunnels themselves a character in the book. <BR>You won't be disappointed if you read this great work.	2004-06-11

The Weatherman has it all; suspense, twists, side stories and a pulse that makes you read late into the night. The back story involves the horrors and aftermath of Vietnam and is told in a voice that makes it so real to the reader, you almost can feel the pain. I'm not waxing poetic on this either, this really is a remarkable piece of work. A modern day serial killer is on the loose and yet everything ties back to Vietnam and the men that fought there. You will remember the characters in this story long after you put it down. The ending's a doozy as well! Enjoy.	2004-05-16

I personally loved this fictionalized &quot;true&quot; story of the OJ trial. I read Dunn faithfully in Vanity Fair and really don't mind all his name dropping. (I think it adds a bit of reality and glamor) The use of &quot;Gus&quot; as his alter ego was a neat twist as well and could make the ending even better than the real thing. The city of LA really becomes another character in this book as well. I'd recommend it to round out any OJ-Trial collection.	2004-04-26

I'm not sure if it's because I've read so many CT books that I'm &quot;use&quot; to her plots and character descriptions (making it sometimes easy to spot the &quot;killer&quot;) or if this is just not one of her best works. I really wasn't impressed with her take on the &quot;mentally challenged&quot; character either. She seemed to make him too smart at times and then, as if catching herself, had him revert back to being a 7 year old.    If you can find this book used, I wouldn't NOT read it, but I certainly wouldn't buy it new. Better yet, get it from the library!

The descriptions of New Orlean's night life are interesting and the city itself is used in an interesting way as another &quot;character&quot; in the story.

I picked up a copy of this book at our library, actually because I liked the cover (sad but true!). I'd never read or heard of David Carkeet, who is a linguist and author of two other works. Reading reviews of his novels, one might be dismissive because of the &quot;highbrow&quot; linguistic tones they take. This book is actually a delight even if you don't care about his use of language and the effects it may have on the plot itself.<BR>The reason I enjoyed this book was really two fold. First, it was great to read something about domestic life from a male protagonist point of view that was actually written by a male. Secondly, the plot itself is just full of wonderful little ironies and threads that weave themselves together beautifully at the end. While some passages are a bit stuffy and seem &quot;full of words&quot; (that lingustics thing again, I guess) for the most part I absolutely loved everything about the story.
