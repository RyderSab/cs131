This book spent five chapters  <br />to explain the weakness of ejb, which may be very useful  <br />last year, but is repetive and less useful now.  <br /> <br />Chapter 6 is an introduction of lightweight IOC container. Then chapter 7 offers an introduction to Spring framework, and chapter 8 moves to Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). These three chapters explained the spring foundation very well. Other chapters are describes use of spring framework in transaction management, persistence, remoting, web design, .... which are good but not as complete as newer books like \\"Pro Spring\\". <br /> <br />If you are interested in Spring framework, besides \\"Pro Spring\\", you may also check \\"Professional Java Development with the Spring Framework\\", another book written by Rod Johnson and his team.	2005-07-26

I ordered and received the book one week ago, I spent all my spare time to read it and could not stop.  <br /> <br />Rob Harrop really exaplained Spring very well.  <br />I started to try Spring since some time, I read the online document and  <br />\\"Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development\\", and \\"Expert One-on-One J2EE Development without EJB\\", but none of them is as clear as this book. <br /> <br />This books gives a very nice explanation to Dependency Injection and AOP, which Spring is based on. It first explains the programmtic way to use DI and AOP, then the declarative way in Spring framework, which helps readers to really understand the framework.  <br /> <br />I also like a lot the part for data access (Hibernate and iBatis), middle tier (transaction, remoting, etc) and the web application part. I now start to understand  <br />use of spring framework rather than try to remember it.  <br /> <br />\\"Spring live\\" may be another good book  <br />for spring web applications, but it's weak on other parts in spring framework.	2005-07-25

The book gives <br />a chapter to Ant and one chapter to JUnit/Cactus and rest to Struts. <br />Most part of the book is on Struts. The authors discuss potential <br />problems using Actions, ActionForms, and Struts tag library.  <br />  <br />Each pitfall has its own section and is formatted the same as the others.  <br />You get a description of each pitfall, an example of the pitfall in action,  <br />and steps for refactoring it. Corrective solutions are well documented with plenty of code samples  <br />to show both before and after images.  <br />  <br />This is a good book on anti-patterns and refactoruing, very good companion of the book &#60;&#60;Rafactorying&#62;&#62; (by Martin Fowler)  <br />and  <br />&#60;&#60;Java Tools for Extreme Programming: Mastering Open Source Tools Including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus&#62;&#62; <br />(this one covers ant and junit/cactus but not struts) <br />  <br />This book is very readable, some may think it just covers obvious problems, actually, it coveres common pitfalls  <br />that most people forget to escape. It's not a difficult book, but very practical. <br />  <br />	2004-11-20

I liked <br />the chapters on JAXP/JAXR, Servlet (2.4), JSP (2.0) and Java Server Faces, <br />they provide you good starting point to understand these new technologies. <br />Since EJB3.0 (and alternatives as Spring framework, hibernate, etc) <br />is out, all chapters on EJB need to be updated. <br /> <br />The author focuses on running and deploying sample code in CD but does not make <br />enough effort to explain the code and concepts involved. It puts too much <br />focus on deployment with <br />Sun's J2EE SDK, some readers who are using Sun J2EE SDK may like it but I think most readers <br />may not the deployment detail. If these details are needed, it's better to put them into another <br />volume. <br /> <br />You can find this book online, but have a printed book may be more convenient. <br /> <br />Since this book covers lots of topics, it's good as a reference.	2004-11-09

This book is full of sound advice, tips and traps. The patterns in this book they are very well identified, specified, clarified, and classified. Martin brings the patterns to life with just the right mixture of prose and code. <BR>He provides a lot of code samples. If you have really complex business logic, you will find how the patterns presented in this book are useful. <br />This book is useful for both J2EE and NET developers. This is particularly useful when attempting to gain an understanding of how application architectures differ between .NET and J2EE. <br />Domain logic patterns described in this book are very interesting, they help you to map domain logic to a design; Data source architectural patterns can be considered as extension of entity bean and DAO; object-relational structural patterns can help you to map object to table design; there are other interesting patterns as Unit of Work (in Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns) and Query Object (in Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns). In a whole, you see all of the basic patterns of object-relational mapping in this book.<br />This book also presents some interesting presentation patterns, besides those presented in Core J2EE patterns, you can find Application Controller, Transform View, Two Step Views patterns very useful also.<br />There are others very useful concurrency patterns, session state patterns, distribution patterns presented in the book, and you can find some \\"Base Patterns\\", which can be considered \\"classical\\" patterns.<br />Martin has successfully shown how to use patterns to link together all of the parts of an enterprise system.<br />Just as Design Patterns did seven years ago, this book will become the basis of a vocabulary that we will use from now on to speak about information system's architecture. This book will be a handbook of many developers.	2002-12-14

This is the first published book for the SCJEA certification. <BR>Although it's very light (less than 200 pages), it does cover <BR>EJB, UML, Design Patterns, Security, Internationlization, and Protocols. It provides useful information on how to apply your <BR>knowledges on these topics, but you should learn the knowledges <BR>from practice or from other books. It contains some very interesting mock questions, on UML, Security, Internationalization, Protocols, which help you a lot to understand the concept in an architect's way. It provides a case study for part II and part III, although it is a good example, you need to know enterprise java architecting before reading this chapter.<br />I finally decide to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two reasons:<BR>1. There is nothing about messaging. legacy connectivity.<BR>2. They copied the nine sample questions from Sun's site, but gave no more explanation. What's more, in the book, the answer of question 5 is incomplete (it should be A, E, but in the book, the answer is E), and the answer of question 9 does not appear in the book (which is D). <br />Since it's the only one available, I suggest you buy (or borrow) this book...	2002-03-28

Its part 2, Design Considerations, Bad Practices and Refactorings, is especially interesting. As we know, good design often does not come at first, it comes after several refactorying, this part explains <BR>how to apply J2EE Patterns by refactorying. <br />Its Part 3, Chapter 6, Patterns Overview, is a very good summary as well. You can find A J2EE Pattern Relationship in Figure 6.2, which is worth reading again and again. Table 6-6, 6-7, 6-8 tell you which pattern, on which page you can use for a special problem you face. <br />There is a case study in Epilogue, it's good but a little light, hope more cases studies can be added in the next edition. <br />Some patterns changed a little for EJB2.0, for example, Composite Entity uses dependent object in EJB1.x, and it uses local interface in EJB2.0; Service locator is used in Message Driven Bean in EJB2.0 now. Since this book was based on EJB1.1, EJB2.0 related features are not included. <br />This book can discover more relationships between different tiers, for example, View Helper pattern can use<BR>Value Object, the idea of Business Delegate can be used in other tiers as well, etc. <br />In a whole, it's a book worth studying carefully.	2002-02-13

Anyway, I  would like to give some personal feedback. <br />1)This book is short in length but rich in content.<br />Chapter 1 convers XML in a standalone java application, SAX parser is used in this chapter; chapter 2 shows a survex project using SAX parser and servlet; chapter 3 demonstrated how to use DTD, CSS within XML editor XMetal; chapter 4 covers XML publishing, same content can be published with different style sheets for HTML, WML and RSS; chapter 5 and chapter 6 describe the conversion between XML and EDI using xsl; chapter 7 is devoted to an e-Business project, using xsl and servlet; chapter 8 can be read after chapter 4, it is also devoted to publishing, with dynamically generated xml content; chapter 9 is devoted to a stock tracking project, which uses SOAP as the communication protocol, it can be read after chapter 7.<br />In a whole, this book covers:<br />a) XML parsers in chapter 1, 2, also java, servlet, design patterns Builder, Visitor. <br />b) XML editor in chapter 3, also CSS, DTD, <br />c) Publishing (XSLT) in chapter 4 and 8, also servlet.<br />d) XML and EDI in chapter 5 and 6, also XSLT.<br />e) e-Business: chapter 7 and 9, also servlet, SOAP.<br />2)This books is written for java developer, good understanding of java and servlet is required.<br />3)There is no chapter on JSP and XML, although there are application of XML with servlet and you can transfer some servlet into JSP; there is no chapter on JMS and XML neither, you may hope to find this kind of example in a JMS book.<br />4)This book is surpringly easy to use. I read it several times, from the beginning to the end. I tried EVERY EXAMPLE in the book, and every example works. <br />To be more honest, I only find one problem in the example (I just want to prove that I really tried every example):  on page 81, third paragraph, first line, the author talks about how to chnage display style in XMetal: <br />Choose Tools, Editor Display Style <br />I found &quot;Editor Display Style&quot; in the menu &quot;Format&quot; instead of menu &quot;Tools&quot;, so maybe  we shuld replace &quot;Tools&quot; by &quot;Format&quot;. <br />5)This book uses a JDBC database HypersonicSQL, and it is on the CD. So no preinstalled  database is required. <br />6)The servlet container used in the book is jetty, the author provided batch file to use it without any difficulty. However, if you use Tomcat or Weblogic or jrun or another servlet  engine, you need to configure it.	2001-07-29

As lots of wrox book, this book does provide some interesting  information. UML diagrams are used for better explanation,  design issues for JSP, using XML with JSP, how interface object, control object and entity object fit EJBs, JMS, Corba, Unit test, are all well explained. <br />However, as the non J2EE edition, the code still contains errors: for all the Primary key classes in examples of EJB, hashCode and equals are not defined, you have to add them yourself. There are errors for package names, for the example, in Chapter 20, Order and Product classes are defined in book.order and book.product classes, and other classes imported them from factory.order and factory.product classes. You have to change &quot;book&quot; to &quot;factory&quot; class by class manually!<br />They used jBoss and orion server to implement EJB examples, I am not against these two servers, but I think it may be better to test the examples with Weblogic as well, since it is the most popular application server, they did not. And they never mentionned Weblogic in the book, not even in the appendix. <br />In split of all these errors,  there is no serious error,  this is a good and interesting book.	2001-07-02

This is the a unique book I've read during my life. Its style is exceptionally relax. <br />It discusses some confusing c++ syntax and three special themes: indirection (smart pointer etc), homomorphic class   hierachies (multiple dispatch, envelope-letter idiom) and memory spaces  (reference counting techniques and relateds classes).<br />Some chpaters are  especially intersting, for example:<br />Chapter 8 about collections, cursors,  and iterators, the cursor idiom was also discussed in  &lt;&lt;More  effective c++&gt;&gt; as proxy, here, it is treated as kind of smart  pointer. <br />chapter 9 about transactions, which discussions how to  implement this important feature with brillang pointers  (variation of  smart pointer)..<br />I agree with the customer from Princeton, USA  that the  book is out of date &amp; contains mistakes, for example<br />It uses  old-style casts, is not const-correct (rarely use const member functions),  doesn't make any reference to the standard library. It does not use  protected instead of public when  defining a class used for base class only  (page 78, class UnsafeNode). Other detail errors: for example, on page 100,  the name of the template used is Ptr, and the template defined is SP; on  page 156, class ArrayOfFoo contains member Foo** contents, constructed by  contents(new Foo*[size]), and the destructor should be delete[] contents  and not delete contents.<br />Some important design errors, for example, on  page 108, you see a template SPOS (stands for &quot;Smart Pointer for  Object Statistics&quot;). <br />class Counter {  ...  public:    int conversions;   int members;<br />};<br />template &lt;class Type&gt;  class SPOS { private:  Type* pointee; public operator Type*() {   pointeee-&gt;conversions++;   return pointee; } }<br />It's better to hide  data &quot;members&quot; and &quot;converions&quot;  in private section of  Counter, and define increment functions for  conversions++ and  members++.<br />It is not exceptionsafe, as almost every c++ book, except  &lt;&lt;Exceptional c++&gt;&gt;, for example, on page 119, we  see<br />template class&lt;class Type&gt; class MP {  private:    Type* t;  public:  MP&lt;Type&gt;&amp; opertor=(const  MP&lt;Type&gt;&amp; mp)  {  if (&amp;mp != this)  {    delete t;   t = new Type(*(mp.t));  }  return this;  }  }<br />We should replace    delete t;   t = new  Type(*(mp.t));<br />by (no self assignment test!)<br />Type *tnew=new  Type(*(mp.t)); delete t; t=tnew;<br />Why? consider what happens if you delete  t and an exception was thrown during t=new Type(*(mp.t)). <br />For this  class, we can also consider reference counting to avoid copy, see  &lt;&lt;More effective c++&gt;&gt;  for a deeper discusion.<br />Overall, this  is a good book, but not must have. You can read &lt;&lt;More effective  c++&gt;&gt; and  &lt;&lt;Advanced c++ styles and idioms&gt;&gt; instead,  but reading this book really will open your eyes, since its point of view  is different and  sometimes it's deeper. Concentrate on its interesting  ideas and pay attention to its potential mistakes.	2000-05-31

The author does not use only examples, but also comparisons, which are really helpful. For example, XML is structure-oriented and not  presentation-oriented, compared to HTML, this book explains the advantage  of this difference. The presentation is clear, key notions as Namespace,  Style Sheets, Dom and Sax, XLink and XPointer are all introduced in chapter  one with examples, and explained in more detail in later chapters. It tells  you also how to read this book, for example, chapter 3 is a little  abstract, and at the beginning of this chapter, the author suggests you to  skip half part and read this chapter later. The author repeats some notions  several times, it may be helpful for beginner, but not for advanced. This  book covers lots of topics, but not in depth. Overall, it is best suited  for beginners. Int/adv readers better read &lt;&lt;Professional  XML&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;XML unleashed&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;XSLT programmers  reference&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;XML Elements of Style&gt;&gt; and other java/asp  xml related books.	2000-05-28

It explains a lot of items in &lt;&lt;effective c++&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;More effective c++&gt;&gt; in more details, it tells you how to do the things, and why to  do in this way. <br />It discusses many idioms, which are the low level  equivalences of patterns (see &lt;&lt;Design Patterns&gt;&gt;), for  example, body/handle idiom is equivalent to bridge pattern, examplar is  equivalent to prototype pattern, envelope/letter is related to state  pattern,  ... Orthodox Canonical class form is called &quot;big three&quot;  in &lt;&lt;c++ faqs&gt;&gt; ... Overloading subscripting for class File and  FileRef on page 51 gives the idea of proxy for distinguishing reads from  writes presented in &lt;&lt;More effective c++&gt;&gt;, but &lt;&lt;More  effective C++&gt;&gt; gives a more detailed discussion on limitations etc  (it's normal since &lt;&lt;More&gt;&gt; appeared much later). It provides  interesting discussion about difference of performance between different  string implementations (p58 -- p65). It discusses relations between pointer  to member functions, functors and virtual functions (2.10 and 5.6), and  explains the power of polymorphism. It discusses &quot;Dynamic  inheritence&quot; in chapter 10, which is not supported directely in C++  (related to state pattern). <br />Overall, this book provides a lot of  original c++ ideas, which affected the later books as &lt;&lt;(More)  Effective C++&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;Design patterns&gt;&gt; very much.<br />It  is more like a book, while &lt;&lt;(More) effective c++&gt;&gt; and  &lt;&lt;Design patterns&gt;&gt; are more like a reference. It contains  exercises (no solutions) at the end of each chapter, while &lt;&lt;(More)  effective c++&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;Design patterns&gt;&gt; do not.<br />Some  discussions are interesting, but not completely correct (it is  understandable because of its publishing year), for example, reference  counting to implement string class, whenshouldn't we use this idiom and  how we can improve it? See further discussion of reference counting for  string using flags &quot;shared&quot;, &quot;sharable&quot; in &lt;&lt;More  effective C++&gt;&gt;. Testing self assignment is a good thing, however, is  it away necessary? No. You can simply allocate new memory before  desallocate old memory, if you avoid self assignment test, you probably not  only improve the performance of your code, but also make it exceptionally  safe (see &lt;&lt;Exceptional C++&gt;&gt;)<br />It lacks discussion for new  features as namespace, exceptions, which you can find in &lt;&lt;More  effective c++&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;Exceptional c++: 47 puzzles&gt;&gt;, STL  can be found in a very good book &lt;&lt;The C++ Standard Library : A  Tutorial and Reference&gt;&gt; as well. It lacks new style cast , for  example, const cast and mutable can be used to make to difference between  logical constness and physical constness, but at the time the book was  writen, they did not exist yet (see 2.9, page 26 -- 28).<br />Implicite type  conversion (3.4)is no longer considered as a good thing for string, read  Item 39 of &lt;&lt;Exceptional C++&gt;&gt; on page 162 to see why (think  about what will happen with or without implicit type conversion: string s1,  s2, s3; s1 = s2 - s3). Imaginary is not Complex (p 89) as circle is not  ellipse (see &lt;&lt;C++ faqs&gt;&gt;).<br />Enough said, I can not give a  complete description of this book here. Overall, it is a very good book,  although it lacks some new features (read &lt;&lt;(More) effective  C++&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Design patterns&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Exceptional  C++&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;The C++ Standard Library : A Tutorial and  Reference&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;C++ faqs&gt;&gt;) and pay attention for  errors inside.

I think this is the first book a C++ programmer should read after reading a C++ syntax book. Every item is useful. This book is not as complete as &lt;&lt;C++ faq&gt;&gt;, but more concise. <br />Some items need to be  updated, however. For example, Item 28, &quot;Use structs to partition the  global namespace&quot;, you can use namespace now (it is also mentioned at  the bottom of the page).<br />I think the items can be better organized, for  example Item 23 &quot;Don't try to return a reference when you must return  an object&quot; and item 31 &quot;Never return a reference to a local  object or a dereferenced pointer initialized by new within the  function&quot; can be combined to one, in item 23, &quot;object&quot; means  a local object, it is better to say it explicitely. Also similar items are  better to put closer, maybe it is difficult, since many items relate to  each other.<br />This is a book for intermediary level, it lacks some more  advanced issues as exception, namespace, etc. Exceptions are discussed in  its following book &lt;&lt;More effective C++&gt;&gt;, however, I would  like to mention the discussion in &lt;&lt;more effective C++&gt;&gt; is not  complete neither, up to now, I can find the most advanced discussions about  exception in &lt;&lt;Exceptional C++&gt;&gt; by Herb Sutter, which is the  book a advanced programmer should read. Discussion about namespace can also  be found in this book. <br />Overall, I think &lt;&lt;Effective C++&gt;&gt; is  a good book for a serious programmer to start his/her c++ career, he/she  can read &lt;&lt;More effective C++&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;Exceptional  C++&gt;&gt; (maybe also &lt;&lt;Advanced C++ styles and idioms&gt;&gt; and  &lt;&lt;C++ for real programmers&gt;&gt;) for more advanced  topics/discussions, and &lt;&lt;C++ faq&gt;&gt; for a complete review of  C++. <br />I regret not being able to find a book for comparison of C++ and  java, two most used programming languages. These two languages are similar  in syntax, but have different features. For example, auto_ptr exists only  for C++ and delegation exists only for java, The differences of languages  affect the design and implementation, &lt;&lt;Design patterns&gt;&gt;  discussed the design patterns with C++ and Smalltalk, however, Java is more  popular than Smalltalk now and I hope to find a book which discusses the  C++ and Java together. A more complete discussion of C++ advanced features  is also needed, Herb Sutter is working on this.	2000-05-07
