Having taught English in Korea for 6 years, I have had many long-standing questions.  The author does not directly answer any of those questions, but he sheds some light by expressing how Asians think. Here are a few of my most long-standing questions:<br /><br />--Why do Koreans take such a stereotypical view of Westerners?<br /><br />Westerners see objects, Asians see fields. Westerners see trees, Asians see forests.<br /><br />This has been demonstrated in the psychology laboratory. Japanese and American subjects were shown a square with a line in it. Then they were shown a larger square and asked to draw a line either proportionately longer or the original length. Japanese subjects were more accurate in drawing the proportionately longer line, American subjects were more accurate in drawing the line the original length.<br /><br />Applied to the present discussion, Asians see our culture as an immense field in which everybody eats with knives and forks and nobody eats with chopsticks.<br /><br />--Why do Koreans think none of us know any Korean?<br /><br />Asians see people not as agents, but as recipients of blessings and victims of curses. Applied to the present discussion, this means that Westerners are automatically blessed with English and deprived of Korean.<br /><br />I have always asked, \\"If they are intelligent enough to learn English, why can't I be intelligent enough to learn Korean?\\" This is probably because learning English is only a recent trend in their culture. So they have not had time to imagine members of other cultures learning their language.<br /><br />--Why aren't Korean teachers more creative?<br /><br />In Asia, the function of education is not to explore the unknown, but to find employment. In the case of teacher education, then, the function is not to find new and better ways of teaching, but to get a teaching job. Any Western notions of cruising the cosmos are inherited from the ancient Greeks.<br /><br />Furthermore, a Korean employee is interested mainly in fitting into the group. What textbook should we use? What time do classes meet? It is disloyal to the group to \\"go off on tangents.\\"<br /><br />--Why can't Korean English students practice independently?<br /><br />Think of the first utterances which you have learned to say in any foreign language. You tell the store clerk \\"I want to buy a . . .\\" You tell the taxi driver \\"I want to go to . . .\\" You tell the doctor \\"I have a sore . . .\\"<br /><br />I, I, I, I, I! How loyal to the group is that? Everyone else in the class is talking about what's on the page in the textbook, so that is what is most important.<br /><br />--Why is it so difficult to inspire discussion in upper-level classes?<br /><br />Like exploring the unknown, the art of debate is brought to us courtesy of the ancient Greeks.e is interested mainly in fitting into the group.

In the development, he plays the first subject against the codetta theme.  Then later, he plays the sub-sections in the related key against each other.<br /><br />Tobin scores a few points, however:<br /><br />--The second theme of the third movement of K 333 in BbM, which starts on the dominant, is the only theme in the collection which does not start on the tonic.<br /><br />--In K 333 in BbM, Mozart begins writing transitory passages which are derived from the subjects.

This book is chuck-full of such lesson ideas.<br /><br />Nash makes several statements without providing the necessary  documentation.  She suggests many ideas which are designed to enhance self-awareness, other-awareness, and various other lofty ideals, but which do not directly pertain to music.  A music teacher might be more willing to use those ideas if their effect were proven with experimental groups and control groups.  Otherwise, what would the music teacher say if the principal walks in and asks, \\"Why aren't you teaching music?\\"<br /><br />Probably in response to Kodaly's lead, Nash expresses aversion to the use of the piano in the elementary music classroom.  She argues that it sets an example of the well-tempered system.  If Nash is assuming that better musicians are more closely attuned to the just-tempered system, she is making a dubious assumption.  Seashore (0486218511) cites a study in which the researcher recorded unaccompanied violin solos by concertmasters of metropolitan symphony orchestras.  When researcher measured the pitches on the recordings, he found that they were likely to fall on the just-tempered pitch, the well-tempered pitch, or anywhere in between.<br /><br />On page 152, Nash asks the rhetorical question, \\"Does the long-rehearsed operetta, the two-month old Christmas program have any rightful place in the elementary school?\\"  That would be an interesting question to discuss further.  My misgiving about dramatic productions is that most students spend idle time while the teacher focuses attention on someone else.  I wonder what Nash's opinion is.<br /><br />Also on page 152, she says, \\"It is a well-known fact that all learning ceases at the point when mechanical drill begins.\\"  If she could document that, it would help me win arguments with my supervisor.	2005-07-10

Why are certain musical activities and gross motor activities beneficial?  If these questions were answered, I would give this book a 6.	2005-05-28

Holden is out of breath from smoking, Hold accidentally blows cigarette smoke into the nuns' faces, and the maid breathes on the family food.<br /><br />--The cap is a consolation prize for failure.<br /><br />--Holden has greater respect for those whose religious beliefs are inconvenient.  That's why he thinks highly of the nuns, but comments disparagingly of the philanthropist undertaker, \\"I can just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs.\\"	2005-05-26

Criticism	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	undoubtedly the best book on the subject	Someday, you may attend a Catcher in the Rye convention.  Everyone else at the convention will be familiar with all of the best-known and oft-quoted commentaries on the novel.  The authors' names will be household words there.  Someone may turn to you and ask question like, \\"What do you think of Heiserman & Miller?\\" \\"Do you agree with Strauch, or disagree?\\"<br /><br />What will you say?  Will you have a ready answer, or will you run out of the room, never to be seen again?  If you want to have a ready answer, then you'd better read the Simonson & Hager anthology!  I can't send you a copy, but I can share a few of the high points in the book.<br /><br />Where does Holden Caulfield's name come from?<br /><br />--\\"Holden\\" means \\"deep valley\\" and \\"cold field\\" means \\"cemetery\\"  (Martin).<br /><br />--Those are the last names of two movie stars (Oldsey).<br /><br />Here are some thoughts on Holden's language:<br /><br />--He says \\"I really mean it,\\" \\"It really does,\\" and \\"If you want to know the truth\\" for fear of falling into phoniness himself (Costello).<br /><br />--He says \\"If you want to know the truth\\" because most people DON'T want to know the truth (Heiserman & Miller).<br /><br />--Kegel sees significance in his frequent use of the word \\"really.\\"<br /><br />--Holden gets the affectionate use of the word \\"old\\" from \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"<br /><br />--Strauch speaks of a \\"literate Holden\\" who talks to adults and a \\"slob Holden\\" who talks to peers.<br /><br />Why is Holden concerned about the ducks in Central Park?<br /><br />--Because the pond freezing over symbolizes death.<br /><br />--Because of the parallel with his own situation.  According to Branch, \\"Holden is essentially homeless, frozen out.\\"  According to Heiserman & Miller, \\"he is a duck himself with no place to go.\\"<br /><br />Here are some more miscellaneous comments on symbolism:<br /><br />--Kegel counts 9 phone calls which were not completed.  He sees this as a symbol of failure in communication.<br /><br />--MacLean sees symbolism in the numerous cases in which Holden trips and falls, such as the theatrical fall down the dormitory stairs and the tripping over \\"about a million garbage cans.\\"<br /><br />--Jane doesn't move the kings out of the back row because she is afraid (Oldsey, Gwynn & Blotner).<br /><br />--The cap symbolizes defiance of convention, according to Branch, or catching, according to Strauch.<br /><br />--Strauch notes that Phoebe wakes up easily but Holden's father doesn't.  Could this be because Phoebe is more enlightened?<br /><br />What sort of Epiphany does Holden undergo at the end of the novel?<br /><br />--Bowden, Gwynn & Blotner,  Corbett, and Branch all quote the passage which reads \\"I sort of miss everybody I told about.\\"  Until now, they were all jerks.<br /><br />--According to Reiman, he now accepts his sister, who is alive and growing, and therefore cannot be rescued from the \\"crazy cliff.\\"  Until now, he only mentions his eternally 10-year-old brother.<br /><br />--Heiserman & Miller ask who is crazy, Holden or the rest of the world.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I still don't know where the ducks go when the pond freezes over.

The last chapter is a quick review of the criticism of the novel.  Other than that, I do not see this book as abounding with content.<br /><br />Nonetheless, here are a few interesting facts and opinions which can be gleaned from this book:<br /><br />--Jane's reluctance to take the kings off the back row is a sign of conservatism.<br /><br />--In his incident with the prostitute, Holden learns that concern and intimacy cannot be bought.<br /><br />--The pond freezing over symbolizes death.<br /><br />--At the end of the novel, when Holden misses all the individuals whom he mention, this is seen as a resolution.<br />Phoebe's reaching for the ring symbolizes the risks which all children must take in growing up.<br /><br />--When Phoebe corrects Holden on the song lyrics (\\"meet a body,\\" not \\"catch a body\\"), she is in effect, asserting that growing children cannot be protected all the time.<br /><br />--Holden wears different personas in the presence of Ackley, Antolini, and other characters in the book.<br /><br />The writer refers to a New York Times review in which an imaginary adult interviews an adolescent who speaks in Holden's style: \\"He shouldv'e cut out a lot about those jerks and all at that crumby school.  They depress me.  They really do.\\"  If you are discussing the novel in a class or seminar, the participants might enjoy a skit adaptation of this review.  The correct documentation is probably:<br /><br />Stern, J.  1951.  \\"Aw, the world's a crumby place.\\"  New York Times Book Review (July 15): 5.<br /><br />If you can find that review, please write back.	2005-04-30

According to Seelye, that is why memories of Allie give Holden such troubled feelings.<br /><br />--Cowan notes that Holden begins the narrative with the words, \\"I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything,\\" and promptly proceeds to do exactly that.<br /><br />--The child who was singing \\"Coming through the rye\\" was walking in a straight line, and was thus protected from the danger of passing automobiles.  Cowan sees this as symbolic.<br /><br />--Cowan comments on the \\"adult diction\\" which Holden uses in the presence of adults.<br /><br />--Holden once attended a public speaking class in which the class members shouted \\"Digression!\\" at appropriate times.  According to Cowan, Holden trusts his present listeners not to do that.<br /><br />--Holden confesses, \\"I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life,\\" yet all of his lies take place in the narrative past.  Cowan sees this as a change on Holdon's part.<br /><br />--Cowan lists the fencing foils, the record for Phoebe, and his younger brother as items which Holden is unable to keep from losing.  Holden's name might be a pun on \\"hold on.\\"<br /><br />--Brookeman is keen on source material.  The movie quote, \\"He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer.  He wants me to go to Oxford\\" is from \\"Ziegfeld Follies\\" starring Fred Astaire and Lucille Ball.  The name for Bernice Krebs, a character introduced on page 73, comes from a Hemingway short story about a soldier who returns from World War I and tries to adapt to civilian life.<br /><br />--Regarding the duck dilemma, Rowe sees a dichotomy between freezing and freedom.  Compare this with Cowan's suggestion of death in general and Allie's death in particular.<br /><br />--The mummies in the museum are peaceful.  According to Shaw, that is why mummies are the only item which Holden can remember on the exam question about Egypt.<br /><br />--Shaw suggests that Holden is avoiding success because he feels guilty for surviving Allie.  He calls attention to a passage in which Holden ascribes guilt to Romeo for surviving Mercutio.<br /><br />--\\"Meet[ing] a body\\" could imply romantic relationships with girls.  According to Shaw, this could be the reason that Holden remembers the lyrics incorrectly.<br /><br />--Finally, Shaw asks who is crazy, Holden or everyone else.<br /><br />I have seen one book which is more helpful in interpreting \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" and that is the Simonson & Hager essay collection, 0669215686.ccording to Shaw, that is why mummies are the only item which Holden can remember on the exam question about Egypt. <br /> <br />--Shaw suggests that Holden is avoiding success because he feels guilty for surviving Allie.

The bulk of this book consists of analyses of individual compositions in the sonata form.  The sections which profited me the most were the analyses of the piano sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven.  That's because I have my own copies of the piano sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven.  When I got to those sections, I marked the appropriate passages on my own copies.<br /><br />The author provides musical examples not only for the Mozart and Beethoven sonatas, but for for every other work which he analyzes.  But I did not read those sections as carefully as I should have.  Marking my own scores was easier because the print is larger, I had the entire composition to refer to for context, and I didn't have to flip the pages of the book back and forth.<br /><br />If you wish to analyze compositions in the sonata form, and unless you have access to a large music library, or unless you are a more diligent student than I am, it might be preferable for you to purchase:<br /><br />1. the scores for the complete sonatas/concertos/symphonies of Mozart/Haydn/Beethoven/Schubert<br /><br />2. a book devoted exclusively to analyzing the complete sonatas/concertos/symphonies of Mozart/Haydn/Beethoven/Schubert	2005-04-10

He gives musical examples which I was unable to follow, but that was probably because I was not reading carefully enough.<br /><br />Rosen does not always define terms as he should.  I would like to know what a \\"counterstatement\\" is, because he uses the term several times.  On page 388, he speaks of Berlioz' idee fixe, but does not tell us what it is.  On page 393, he categorizes intra-movement thematic relations as \\"explicit\\" and \\"implicit,\\" but will not define the two.  I would like to know what the two terms mean.  On page 403, he tells us that the Stravinsky piano sonata is in the \\"concerto grosso form.\\"  What does that mean?<br /><br />While we are on the subject of terminology, this is the arena where Rosen throws a couple of boomerangs.  He scorns the terms \\"first\\" and \\"second theme,\\" preferring the terms \\"first\\" and \\"second group,\\" but then he forgets and uses those terms himself.<br /><br />He also denies that Haydn's sonata movements are \\"monothematic,\\"<br /><br />and charges users of this term of misanalysis.  But then he forgets and uses this term himself.<br /><br />In the last chapter, he answers a question which I have been wondering: why does discussion of the sonata form usually ignore every composer since Beethoven.  Rosen tells us that there has been little contribution to the form since Beethoven.  He uses a composition by Schumann as a bad example and gives only a couple of good examples.  He accredits Brahms with a few redeeming features, and give several other composers a cursory mention.<br /><br />I hope to compose good sonata movements despite the handicap of living after Beethoven.	2005-04-03

On page 188, a teacher delivers a quote which favors living for a great cause over dying for a great cause.  How do these two connect?<br /><br />--Holden repeatedly lies about his age and repeatedly orders alcohol.

I was completely lost during that chapter.<br />The bulk of the book goes over the opera with a fine-tooth comb.  I thought I knew the opera well, but through much of this discussion, I could not understand which passage in the opera the author was referring to.  He gives musical examples, but not often enough.<br />The discussion on the last 59 pages of the opera is interesting, however.  He points out which contributions were from Puccini and which were from Alfano.<br />If you don't know every word and every note of the opera, be prepared to hold this book in one hand and a score of the opera in the other hand.	2004-06-05

You might not be able to put it down until you finish it.<br />The book is not a historical source, but nor does it purport to be.  He tells of an organ-grinder who was playing the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana.  Mascagni passes by and advises him to play it at a different tempo.  The next day, the organ-grinder is seen wearing a sign saying &quot;Student of Mascagni.&quot;  In other anecdote collections, the organ-grinder is either a &quot;Student of Verdi&quot; playing an excerpt from Il Trovatore or a &quot;Student of Puccini&quot; playing Musetta's Waltz from La Boheme.  Could this be a true story which happened three times?<br />The author occasionally strays from the assigned topic of anecdotes to discuss individual composers and performers.  He makes value judgments with which the reader may or may not agree. He certainly does not esteem Puccini as highly as I do.<br />Just one grievance: the author assumes that every reader knows every well-known opera ever written.  He refers to operatic characters and operatic highlights without telling the reader which opera he is referring to.  I felt like I was the only opera-lover in the world who was too stupid to know that Kundry is a character in Parsifal.	2004-04-01

According to this analysis, the innermost brain, inherited from our reptilian ancestors, houses the most basic instincts.  The next layer, inherited from our earliest mammalian ancestors, is called the limbic system.  This section houses the emotions.  The outermost layer, developed still later, is called the neocortex.  This section houses our higher thinking skills.<br />If you didn't know that before, do you understand it now?  If so, then you have just read pages 38 and 39 of \\"Battling the Inner Dummy.\\"  So you know all the author has to say about the triune brain.<br />Throughout the rest of the book, the author talks about everything under the sun.  One chapter is an introductory course on Abnormal Psychology.  Another chapter introduces us to the Theory of Relativity.  In three more chapters, we get an overview of psychotherapy techniques.  For reasons known only to himself, the author devises 10-point scales for various personality traits.  There is also an extended scenario in which Freud comes back as a consultant for an advertising campaign.  You might find it entertaining, you might think it's kyootsee-kyoot.<br />Here are some important questions which Weiner gives only a cursory glance:<br />Why are male heterosexuality and female heterosexuality so different?  Men patronize prostitutes and porno magazines, whereas women patronize drugstore novels.  A look at our primeval past can answer this question.<br />Why are people attracted to illegal drugs?  Why are people attracted to foods which overdose on sugar, salt, and fat?  Probably because such stimuli did not make their appearance soon enough in the history of the human brain.<br />The remaining questions Weiner does not discuss at all:<br />Why is there so much misunderstanding between women and men?  Women exhort men to be honest about their feelings, but to no avail.  Men refuse to ask for directions when they are lost, much to women's distress.  These questions, too, can be answered in terms of the triune brain.<br />Why does a schoolteacher see the classroom as a battleground and see the students as enemies?  Probably because the schoolteacher is clicking on the wrong section of the brain.<br />Why is one person so often proud of another person's accomplishment?  When a citizen from your hometown wins a big competition, the whole town celebrates.  Why should anyone else be proud when it was only that one person's accomplishment?<br />Likely because the citizens unconsciously think they are at war with everybody else.<br />Why are we so undiplomatic in expressing our opinions to a person who disagrees with us?  After all, we want to influence the other person.  Insulting and threatening that person will certainly not do the trick!  Here again, our battle instincts come to the surface.<br />Why does prejudice rear its ugly head so often?  Most likely because foreign language textbooks are a recent invention.  If someone who looked and acted differently from you came up to you and said \\"Buenos dias,\\" you wouldn't know WHAT that meant!  The safest assumption is that it means \\"I'm going to eat you alive!\\"<br />What poses, gestures, and physical features make children cute, make women sexy, and make men manly?  Lorenz (0674846303 and 0452011752), Tinbergen (1558210490), and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (0670167096 and 0416074804) have interesting answers to these questions, but Weiner apparently hasn't read about them.<br />If Weiner is so interested in psychological abnormalities, he could consider the effects of living in nuclear families while our inner brains are programmed for living in extended families.  Many of our psychological problems--such as pedophilia--involve treating a person of one age or gender as we could more appropriately treat a person of another age or gender.  It is reasonable to suggest that an upbringing in the presence of people of all ages and both genders could preclude such problems.<br />Why do liberals and conservatives fight an ongoing battle in many countries?  Some animals are interdependent because they hunt in packs.  Some animals are independent because they hunt alone.  Some animals are half and half because they hunt both ways.  That's why all dogs are Democrats, all cats are Republicans, and humans are half and half.<br />There is much to be said about evolutionary psychology.  So why does Weiner say so little?clude such problems.<br />Why do liberals and conservatives fight an ongoing battle in many countries?  Some animals are interdependent because they hunt in packs.

The second part deals with the author's experience working overseas in the Peace Corps.<br />At the time I read this book, I wasn't interested in the Black ghetto, but was interested in the Peace Corps.  Consequently, I wasn't interested in the first part but was interested in the second part.  The author contends that both experiences contributed to his evolving from a national citizen to a world citizen.  But I wasn't interested in that; I was interested in the Peace Corps.<br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book for a person interested in foreign service.	2003-04-02

For the second half, he discontinues this pattern.<br />Nabokov was decades ahead of the professional writers on the subject.  He commits rationalizations which de Young commented on in 1982.  He comments on \\"blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks\\" and his love-object's \\"beautiful boy-knees\\" and \\"blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks.\\" In 1962, Fitch was the first professional writer to comment on pedophiles' preference for androgynous children.<br />Our hero also ascribes magical powers to himself and those like him.  He thereby jumps the gun on \\"A Study of the Child Molester,\\" which was published in 1984.<br />Most significantly, he shows the tendency of pedophiles to idealize their subjects.  The first professional writers to comment on pedophiles idealizing children were McCormack  & Selvaggio (1889) and Segal & Stermac (1990).

Furthermore, I know that the book is 500 pages thick.  But that doesn't mean I have to give it a high rating.  The fact is that one learns very little about the purported topic from reading those 500 pages.<br /><br />Some of the articles are good, some are not so good.  Let me take them one by one.  FEIERMAN, the editor, gives an opening chapter and a closing chapter, both of which are difficult to understand.  BULLOUGH offers  some interesting historical anecdotes.<br /><br />A couple of articles take issue with the prevailing literature.  OKAMI claims that the professional literature on pedophilia biased, as shown in loaded terminology such as \\"abuser,\\" \\"victim,\\" and \\"coercion.\\"  GARLAND AND DOUGHER question the notion that abuse in an adult's past causes the adult to abuse children in the present.<br /><br />The purpose of the book seems to be a search for an evolutionary explanation of pedophilia.  Many of the articles, such as the one by MEDICUS & HOPF, pertain to evolution, but not to pedophilia.  According to EIBL-EIBESFELDT, reptiles are not affectionate toward their offspring, as are mammals.  He says nothing about unhealthy affection toward juveniles.  ANDERSON & BIELERT, PUSEY, TAUB, and DE WAAL discuss normal adult male/juvenile interactions among our simian cousins, but make no implications for abnormal interactions in our own species.  Likewise for D'UNDINE discussing rodents and DOMJAN discussing Japanese quails.  According to MACKEY, adult males are more active with juveniles among monogamous species than among polygamous species.  Again, the discussion is only of natural parental instincts, with no implications for pedophilia.  DIENSKE discusses normal adult/child feelings in other cultures and other species.  Once again, what does that have to do with abnormal feelings?<br /><br />You almost have to be a biochemist to understand the articles by GLADUE and HUTCHINSON AND HUTCHINSON.  They talk about glands, but offer no speculation of any pedophile gland.<br /><br />SHIEFENHOVEL, unlike most of the other writers, sticks to the topic.  He discusses ritualized sexual abuse in Melanesia.<br /><br />DIAMOND tells us about sexual freedom in Hawaii before Captain Cook, but says nothing about sex with or among children.<br /><br />Most, but not all, of the article by MONEY is about the topic of the book.  He mentions the two great Victorian children's writers, he traces the origin of word \\"pedophilia\\" and other psychiatric terms, and diverges into sundry other subjects.<br /><br />There is a first-person account by an incarcerated offender writing under the name of SILVA.  He maintains that he did not hurt any juveniles and regrets only getting caught.<br /><br />I can't tell you anything about the article by ZIVIN because I can't understand it.<br /><br />If you want to know my opinion, I say that pedophilia is a product of malimprinting, not evolution.  If evidence from archaeology and anthropology is any indication, our ancestors lived in extended families.  That gave people of all ages and both genders a chance to deal with people of all ages and both genders.<br /><br />A 1986 study by Raboch & Raboch finds that pedophiles tend to be the youngest in the family, with no younger children to nurture.  In an extended family, younger cousins and nieces and nephews would meet that need.  Numerous studies find that stepfathers, who lacked the opportunity to watch the stepchild grow up, are more frequent offenders than fathers.  Again, a lifetime in an extended family eliminates that danger.<br /><br />If you want to know about pedophilia as related to biology, this book will be of little help to you.lands, but offer no speculation of any pedophile gland.<br /><br />SHIEFENHOVEL, unlike most of the other writers, sticks to the topic.

If you are interested in both music and the paranormal, this book is for you.  The author claimed that spirits of the great composers came back to dictate music to her while she played the dictated music on the piano.  So this is definitely a job for CSICOP.<br />I have wondered why the author could not merely leave a pencil and stack of staff paper on the table overnight.  If Franz Liszt can rotate a swivel chair, as he allegedly does in a scene from the book, then the spirits must have power to move physical objects.<br />Whether true or false, this is a fascinating book.	2003-02-14

Pigliucci only gives us is a reference to a journal article on this question.<br />How can we answer the numerous arguments in \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" by Michael Behe?  Pigliucci provides some rebuttal, but not much.  Rather, he tosses off this responsibility by referring us to the talkorigins Website.  I appreciate the references, but I had hoped to do all my shopping in one stop.<br />And how about another tough challenger--\\"Icons of Evolution\\" by Jonathan Wells?  He spends a few pages on this book, but not enough.  He uses technical terms which he doesn't define, and he hastily presents arguments without clearly spelling out each premise.<br />Is this book a history of the Creationist-Evolutionist dispute?

Teaching about science is easier than most people think,\\" goes Sagan's message.<br />But then in the next chapter, he explains Maxwell's theories in words which I can't understand.<br />I know more about music theory than most people, but I don't feel burdened by carrying those facts around in my brain.  They all interconnect, so they all seem like only one simple fact to me.  I would probably enjoy a TV program in which a musical composition is analyzed, but most people wouldn't.<br />In like manner, a person who knows many interconnected facts about science could probably enjoy a science program, but not enough to make the Neilsons happy.<br />Such a person, undoubtedly, is Sagan himself.  Betcha he knew so many interconnected facts about science that they seemed like only one simple fact to him.  This probably made him think that one could teach another person about science as easily as one could teach a person that \\"Dover is the capital of Delaware.\\"<br />2. Is science really as interesting as the paranormal?<br />Excuse me for a minute while I talk about myself:  It would be nice if I could make a scientific discovery which would add to the total body of knowledge.  That would be immensely gratifying to my hunting instinct.<br />But how could I realize such a dream?  First of all, I would have to  understand Maxwell's formulas.  That task alone leaves me flabbergasted, and that's only step one.<br />My hopes of meeting an extraterrestrial or an archangel are small indeed, but greater than my hopes of making a scientific discovery.  Consequently, the paranormal continues to interest me more than science no matter how much I read The Skeptical Inquirer.<br />I once expressed these feelings at a skeptics club meeting.  I suggested that most paranormalists believe as they do because they, like me, want to make discoveries which will add to the total body of knowledge.<br />A Montessori teacher at the meeting countered by telling us of a workshop which she presented for public school math teachers.  By hands-on demonstration, they showed many wonders which their visitors had never seen before.  A square really is--well, a square!  A cube really is--well, a cube!  Those who were not too awe-stricken to move were frenetically writing notes.<br />Her testimony proves to my satisfaction that we can meet an important need by learning about the known world.  But we are creatures with many needs.  Maybe learning about the unknown world could be a completely different need.  Could one ever substitute for the other?  Probably, probably not.<br />Suppose one of the workshop visitors arrived home that night and came face to face with an alien offering an abduction.  Would the answer be yes or no?<br />3. inquiry, not faith<br />If I understand correctly, Sagan offers science education as an antidote to tabloid gullibility.  Yes, I know, it's not facts about science which are so important, it's the scientific method.<br />But would an upgrading of science education really do the trick?  I doubt it.  Scientists are blessed with both facts about science and the scientific method.  So according to Sagan's logic, they should be the least gullible.<br />The title of \\"least gullible,\\" however, seems to go to stage magicians.  Stage magicians have caught psychics who have fooled scientists.  In fact, Randi hasn't missed one yet!<br />Maybe the answer is not more science education, but more stage magic education.<br />It's a fascinating and informative book, despite these few points of disagreement.aranormalists believe as they do because they, like me, want to make discoveries which will add to the total body of knowledge.<br />A Montessori teacher at the meeting countered by telling us of a workshop which she presented for public school math teachers.

Abanes discusses matters which are important to both believers and non-believers, such as the importance of respecting fat people, skinny people, and Moaning Myrtles.<br />As for whether or not occult powers really exist, Abanes presents a case of a person undergoing eerie visions and sensations while becoming entrapped in Satanism.  I wonder, however, if those visions and sensations resulted from the drugs and alcohol which the person was consuming at the time.<br />I was surprised that Abanes cited evidence that astrology is ineffective.  This indicated to me that astrology comes from neither God nor Satan.<br />Yes, Abanes argues very convincingly that the occult is at odds with Christianity.

The passages printed in large type are relatively easy for them, so they are quite willing to spend five or ten minutes being tested on those passages.<br />The book also supplies comic relief.  The middle school students find it mildly amusing, the elementary school students find it moderately amusing, and the preschool students roll on the floor.	2000-12-06

I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children.  Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity.  Why won't they provide any input of their own?  Am I overpowering them without realizing it?<br />This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!	2000-11-22

I had never realized that there has been an ongoing battle between firstborns and latterborns all through history. Nor had I realized that most of my disagreements have been with people who are of the opposite birth order.<br />As a result of reading this book, I have twofold advice for anyone:<br />1. Don't be too hard on yourself if you clash with those of opposite birth order.  It's probably not your fault.<br />2. Don't be too hard on the other party if you clash with those of opposite birth order.  It's probably not their fault, either.<br />I have just one criticism of the historical examples: why wasn't the protest against the Vietnam war ever mentioned?	2000-11-07

I then read this book to the class in my own English translation, I was thus spared all the inane &quot;pika's&quot; and &quot;booboo's&quot; which you see mentioned in the other reviews. This gave the class practice in the verbs &quot;goes outside,&quot; &quot;runs,&quot; &quot;eats dinner,&quot; &quot;sleeps.&quot;  The students enjoyed the Pikachu character so much that they forgot that English class was supposed to be a drudgery.<br />I had only one problem: I bought one copy, it got stolen, I bought a second copy, it got stolen, and the store was out of stock when I tried to buy a third copy.  That's why I'm ordering from Amazon.	2000-11-06
