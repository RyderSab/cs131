This lady does not hold back - a characteristic that makes for very interesting reading. In The Wendy Williams Experience she plainly and unapologetically provides juicy details of celebrity interviews. She boldy states how she feels about the biggest names in showbiz - P. Diddy, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, and spares no mercy. Yikes! The book raises eyebrows but you do wonder about the author's motives. Does she sincerely care for celebrities, does she want to be bigger than the celebrities, or does she just get her kicks exposing celebrities? At least she admits to getting plastic surgery - but I'm not sure the surgery does her any justice. At any rate, the book is an explosive pageturner, and offers eye-opening insights into the lives of well-known stars.	2005-09-11

We're invited to look inside the busy world of Marilyn Grimes, a middle-aged woman who lives with her husband Leon in Oakland Hills, California. She tries to be patient with her nosey mother-in-law Arthurine, someone who also lives in their home along with her dog Snuffy, an animal that Marilyn doesn't particularly like. Her marriage isn't exactly what it used to be and it isn't hard to entertain second thoughts about whether the relationship is worth the effort. <br /> <br />In addition to working part-time in a crafts store, Marilyn is involved in the lives of her family, a mother who's acting a bit bizarre and is experiencing the issues that go along with aging and health. Marilyn's three kids are in college and are making important decisions for themselves. And her mother Lovey, adopted sister Joy plus her two kids, are other family members with pressing matters that require attention. And Marilyn can't help herself - she is too concerned about them to not be bothered, but is it okay to pull yourself away from everyone else's worries and start thinking about what you want to do with your own bored and lonely existence? <br /> <br />A steamroller of a novel, The Interruption of Everything builds slowly but picks up the action and unveils an intensifying plot chapter after chapter. The action is so subtle, it's scary, so surprising yet relatable, as it touches on women's issues, family, and friendships. And there are so many characters that do things you've done, that say what you think, and feel the way you feel. What's amazing about this book is how understated it appears -- the calm within the chaos -- that you'll eagerly watch how Marilyn handles the pressures of a life that is spinning out of control. <br /> <br />A richly drawn story filled with thought-provoking scenes, the character Marilyn makes you laugh at things you know you shouldn't laugh at, but what the heck, it's funny, and it's real, and it's true. So go ahead and laugh. Embrace the warmth and sensitivity of the Interruption of Everything, a treasure of a novel that is highly recommended.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-07-19

I believe that there will be a few aspects of Karrine's story that are relatable: many women have low self-esteem, many seek to be loved and feel valuable. Unfortunately, based on the writer's childhood and family environment, she wasn't provided with a stable and loving upbringing. She sought acceptance through sexual relationships and she has no self-respect, both of which contributed to her downfall.  <br /> <br />Because of her unfortunate foundations, it is sad and fascinating to see the path she traveled that led her to experience so many unfulfilling and sometimes dangerous sexual relationships with men in the entertainment and sports industries. I believe that Hollywood paints such a false and misleading picture of success - the more money you earn, the more material things you acquire, and the more you associate with the so-called in-crowd, the more valuable you are. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth and the book serves as a good wake-up call.  <br /> <br />Although Ms. Steffans went through much pain and heartache, maybe her story can be a harsh reminder that self-esteem cannot be based on the acceptance of others - people can let you down - and your true value isn't based on the false security of materialism, things come and go. <br /> <br />This book should be read by young women who believe that being a video ho is something to be proud of. This book will show you the downside of the industry that isn't often publicized -- and if some young lady's life can be altered - perhaps Karrine's story is worth telling, even if everyone doesn't agree with how she's telling it. <br />	2005-07-07

So when she's introduced to another captivating man, the life that she's known comes to a gridlock. And through many conversations with her mother, her grandmother, and good but flaky girlfriend Cedra, Aisha braves much self-exploration to show herself who she is, and who she is not.  <br /> <br />Written with a sophisticated style that tenderly and honestly explores women's issues, Benilde Little has penned another moving and insightful novel about how to trust your instincts even when your life is filled with uncertainty.	2005-04-27

The novel picks up where P.G. County left off and resumes the story of Barbara Bentley, wife of philanderer Bradford, and her equally enthralling co-residents of a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb. <br /> <br />Barbara is trying to cope with life as a rich businessman's wife -- is she happy with the high-end shopping, the swanky parties, and does she really have to continue putting up with catty Jolene, her hubby's former flame? Life is about to get interesting as Barbara takes up a new interest - selling real estate. <br /> <br />Then there's Pearl, a hefty yet sincere single mother that has caught the attention of Patrick, Jolene's ex-husband. If only Jolene would stick her nose in her own business, maybe she'd really find true happiness, instead of finding herself getting into deeper trouble.  <br /> <br />And who can forget the new neighbor on the block -- the beautiful and mystical Veronique, a baroness who brings lots of rich tales and drama to the lives of her new friends.  <br /> <br />Both amusing and delectable, Can't Get Enough is a pleasing and spirited novel - one that may entice and surprise you with its climatic twists; and one that includes all the ingredients of a perfect summer read.	2005-04-27

One brother is Colin Sheffield, a somewhat bitter writer who yearns to be more successful. His younger sibling is Courtney, a rising star in the world of basketball. These men have inner struggles, secrets, and past hurts that threaten to destroy everything they yearn to have. In spite of personal obstacles, will their ambitions drive the brothers apart, or unite them? <br /> <br />Playing With Destiny is a compulsively readable novel that highlights the talents of newcomer Phillip Thomas Duck. He is a fresh voice whose storytelling skills bring the familiarity of a well-tell story, plus his own unique way with words. Phil has a knack for unveiling an engaging story incorporating enough suspense to keep you turning the pages. What's also refreshing about Playing with Destiny are the characters -- Phill made them human; they have good days and bad days, joys and sorrows. <br /> <br />As Colin and Courtney tangle with certain issues, we see that the characters are relatable. They talk about and experience situations that we can understand. They live in a real world -- with real emotions -- all of which makes for a real wonderful read.	2005-03-18

It's too short.\\" This perfectly describes Cheryl's novel -- a marvelously interwoven story about Porter and Winona, two young adults who are individually going through great tribulations which ultimately ties them together.  <br /> <br />If It Ain't One Thing is a realistic, hard-hitting, urban contemporary novel that covers everything: family, friends, male/female relationships, spirituality, old demons, sensuality, secret sins, and more, and does so in a style that is engaging, thought-provoking, and entertaining. It's the type of book that may remind you of Eric Jerome Dickey's Friends and Lovers, offering you page after page of characters filled with passions that become their snare; characters that go through so much you can't help but wonder what's going to happen next. <br /> <br />Cheryl Robinson is a superb writer.

With its cinematic feel, this novel easily persuades you to read page after eye-opening page until you race to the ending.   <br /> <br />The story involves Corey, a New York teen who becomes influenced by the wrong crowd. He's caught up in the game, and the decisions he makes greatly impacts his life. A wide range of convincing characters make up this story and each one of them is memorable and spring from the pages like they are commanding your attention. <br /> <br />Shannon Holmes absolutely has his finger on the pulse of the realities of thug life; where disillusioned young men become trapped in a cycle of drug-infested darkness, and where ruthless killers and dealers know only one way of life. While reading I felt as if I was in prison, and I couldn't wait to get to the end, so I could escape, so I could breathe. The story is authentic, raw, and brutal, yet humorous in an odd kind of way. It's an important book that should be read by every young man and woman, and even their parents. The hardest thing to read is the dialogue; it's very street, lots of slang, and in one chapter, for some reason, Corey uses perfectly good English which kind of threw me off, but it wasn't a biggie. Nevertheless, I've read a lot of books this year, and Never Go Home Again ranks among the most impressive.  <br />	2004-12-20

She is emotional - mad, happy, afraid, shy, indignant, jealous, and everything in between. She's not perfect, she's real and that's a wonderful attribute to find in fiction.

The novel starts off great: there's lots of attitude, spunk, humor, and spicy dialogue to keep the pages turning. The alternate chapters that are written by husband and wife team, Nick Chiles and Denene Millner, work well - we are allowed to get inside the head of a single male father and receive plenty of info regarding his feelings on parenting, dating, societal issues, and it is refreshing to receive a balanced viewpoint.  But mid-way through the book, the storyline and chapters for both Kenneth and Zaria become unfocused in that some of the scenes and thought processes are repeated unnecessarily. <br />When the novel concentrates solely on Zaria and Kenneth's relationship, the pacing is smooth; but a few of the subplots hamper the action, yet don't greatly affect the overall good writing and juicy story. Lots of foreshadowing make much of the novel predictable, nevertheless, readers who enjoyed Love Don't Live Here Anymore should also be entertained with In Love and War, another satisfying offering from Chiles and Millner.	2003-02-07

She paints scenes with her words, makes you feel the characters, tempts you to question what you'd do if you were in Ina's situation, the narrator of this novel about a wife who finds herself in a marriage/mommy/woman dilemma. Benilde Little makes you know the character; every emotion that Ina feels, it's as good as yours. If Ina is there, so are you. Some of Ina's feelings are disturbing, or is it that she's just real, honest, able to get in touch with her heart no matter what's inside. In truth, Ina confesses certain feelings that many of us might hide for fear of judgment, for fear of misunderstanding. But if we're honest we can relate to Ina's musings, her regrets and non-satisfaction as a tired and wore-out mom, a disillusioned wife. <br />Her third novel in approximately seven years, Little's absence from fiction has been felt; her return well worth the wait.

But there's also the sensitive side, the unanswered questions regarding the behavior of Mia and Miles and other key characters. <br />This novel may appeal to readers that enjoy taking a peek at romantic adventures on the high seas, and if you're like me and have never been on a cruise before, this book is an excellent way to know what you can expect.	2003-01-07

The author's descriptions make you feel as if you're in NYC, in the 60's, smelling the smells of greens and potato salad, and listening to the sounds within the clubs - the loud musical instruments, the moans of jazz songs, and the funny/naughty/down-home conversations.<br />Vibrant characters, a compelling plot, and plain old good storytelling make Friday Nights at Honeybee's a commendable and highly recommended read.	2003-01-02

It is complex and difficult to describe in simplistic terms. All that can be said is, this reviewer was hooked from page one because of the character called PJ. Even as a child, she had spunk, sassiness, and was vividly drawn. And as an adult, she was real, making choices in life that weren't all good or bad. <br />Throughout the novel, the writer's words are like poetry; she is very adept at putting one word after another to paint and sketch so the reader can see and hear. <br />The one thing that one must be aware about, however, is the abundance of narrative in the story which may make it seem slow. You're anxious to get to the end, but you may find it difficult to do so.  But if you're patient, and stick it out, you may be happy to read a story that makes you about the possibilities of how your ancestors can guide you, speak to you, and make a difference in your life even when they aren't no longer physically present.	2002-04-12
