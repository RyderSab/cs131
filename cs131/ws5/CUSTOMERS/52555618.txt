Joel Osteen, just may be America's most popular preacher. He is the pastor of the US's fastest growing mega-church, Lakewood Church (Houston), attracting some 30,000 worshipers to its weekend services. He attracts more than the 25,000 who attend worship at Rev.Rick Warren's, \\"Purpose Driven Life\\" author, Saddleback Church (Lake Forest, CA.). In addition, far more Americans know Osteen through TV. Over the course of the average month, some 18 million individuals tune in for one of his sermons, making him the most-watched preacher on television, outstripping Rev. Robert H. Schuller (The Crystal Cathedral).<br /><br />What is amazing is that Warren has been growing his church for over twenty years and Schuller celebrates his 50th year this year. Osteen didn't even begin preaching until shortly before his father, John, who founded Lakewood, died in 1999. But since Joel took over the pulpit, attendance has quadrupled. Lakewood has just spent $90 million to renovate the 16,000-seat Compaq Center in downtown Houston as its new home.<br /><br />Like Warren and Schuller, Osteen has become an author. In \\"Your Best Life Now,\\" he reveals the seven principles he followed to achieve his own \\"rags-to-riches\\" story.<br /><br />* Enlarge Your Vision<br /><br />* Develop a Healthy Self-Image<br /><br />* Discover the Power of Your Thoughts and Words<br /><br />* Let go of the Past<br /><br />* Find Strength Through Adversity<br /><br />* Live to Give<br /><br />* Choose to Be Happy<br /><br />Recently, Business Week described Osteen as the \\"Prosperity Preacher\\" of the \\"Prosperity Gospel.\\" \\"Your Best Life Now\\" reflects this theology. It is a secular self-help book and has little to do with Christian values.	2005-09-06

Susan Cheever, author and biographer, has done an excellent job in detailing Bill Wilson's life and his role in founding Alcoholics Anonymous. I am not an uninterested reader as I am an Adult Child of an Alcoholic (ACA). I spent several years attending ACA meetings and moving through the twelve steps. And I know firsthand of the genius of co-founders Bill Wilson and Bob Smith. My involvement in ACA led to significant life changes which have proven invaluable. I often wonder what would I be today if I had not spent time in ACA.. I am truly blessed to have had ACA (Wilson and Smith) available to me.<br /><br />My involvement with ACA stimulated curiosity about how it was founded and by whom. My dad joined AA in the early 1940's, not long after it was formed in Chicago, and he met with Wilson on several occasions when Wilson visited Chicago.  When I learned of \\"My Name is Bill,\\" the book went to the top of my reading list.<br /><br />While those who are associated with AA, Al-Anon, or ACA may be the most interested in \\"My Name is Bill,\\" this is book for all. Cheever tells a wonderful story of a man who made a major contribution to the world, warts and all. Wilson was no saint, but, then, neither are we. Cheever's turning-over of every stone makes the book all the more compelling.<br /><br />Cheever covers Wilson's rural childhood, his drinking, the creation of AA, and his life after AA. She goes into great detail about his involvement with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (and the role the Rockefeller's played) and Carl Jung, the development of the `sponsor\\" and the twelve steps, his marriage and the unfailing devotion of his wife (led to Al-Anon).<br /><br />This is a great book for all...with much to reflect on and much to be grateful for, particularly for the life of Bill Wilson, whose work has changed the life of millions. May God be shining his grace on him.	2005-09-06

The storyline begins with Reidy's early departure from the Army (his decision when offered) and ends with his \\"premature\\" departure from Pfizer. Premature since his sales territory achieves number one status shortly after he leaves.<br /><br />Reidy provides interesting detail on the Pfizer recruiting process (they love Mormons and military officers);  Pfizer's sales training program (pharmaceutical brainwashing); the tension and field tactics around being closely monitored by managers (voicemail then expense report receipts then sample sheet signatures); and, reasons why female reps do better than male reps (Gloria Steinem, where are you?).<br /><br />Reidy joined Pfizer's newly formed pediatric/ENTs/ObGyn specialty sales force where he distinguished himself with mediocre sales and poor work activity. His lackluster performance put him in-line for a promotion, as the Pfizer culture encouraged the promotion of incompetence rather than dealing with it (Hank McKinnell, where are you?). Fortuitously for Reidy, he was \\"promoted\\" to a newly formed Urology sales force created to launch Viagra (erectile dysfunction), a drug launch which became the most successful in history.<br /><br />The author notes that he came to view competition, Abbott and Lilly, as enemies of society because they lied and cheated. Meanwhile, he and some colleagues used \\"Sample Closets\\" as pharmaceutical filling stations when in need (as did office personnel and docs); falsified regulated sample sheet signatures when in need of time off; and rigged giveaways when seeking a new route to a doctor they wanted to build a relationship with.<br /><br />One redeeming aspect of this book is the focus on the role of the drug rep (applies also to diagnostic and medical technology reps). Doctors in private practice lose their source of education about drugs and do not have time to refresh themselves about what was previously learned or educate themselves on new drugs. The number one complaint of doctors is that they do not have enough time. As a result, doctors stick to products that they were trained to use and have grown comfortable with (even if detrimental to the patient).  Reps, once \\"in,\\" can fill this void providing valuable clinical information on both existing and new products. However, as Reidy shows us, a rep can also take advantage of his/her trusted position influencing the decision-making process negatively.<br /><br />This book is a must read for all healthcare executives, regulators, legislators, doctors, and office personnel. Not only does the book provide an insider's view of another industry problem, but also puts us on notice not to hire Jamie Ready.time to refresh themselves about what was previously learned or educate themselves on new drugs.

Woodward, in his \\"The Secret Man,\\" provides us with a brisk, hard to-put-down read focusing on his interaction and relationship with Mark Felt, Watergate's \\"Deep Throat.\\" Woodward's trademark, news reporter's style gives this the snappy feel of today's breaking news...which it is, since he wrote it in ten days.<br /><br />Woodward reveals how he networked his way to being privy to one of the biggest news stories of the 20th Century creating a maelstrom that brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon. He covers everything from the Watergate break-in, its investigation, his initial meeting with Felt, events leading  to a  relationship with one of the highest placed Watergate government insiders, to the fall of the Nixon Whitehouse.<br /><br />Readers get the whole picture of the Woodward/Carl Bernstein team. Woodward used his  Midwestern doggedness to woo Felt as a mentor then as a source. Persistence paid off handsomely.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Man\\" fills in some but not all of the blanks. Woodward reveals a lot about Felt and about himself, including errors he made along the way. He, however, never gets to the biggest question of all, \\"Why did Felt do what he did.\\" What was his motivation? With this in mind, I suspect that many will be looking to Felt's story (being written now) for the \\"rest of the story.\\"	2005-07-13

The author, Dave Pelzer, details his early childhood until the time he was \\"rescued\\" from his abusive parents and home. Pelzer's story is the third worst case of child abuse on record in the state of California.<br /><br />The book begins with the rescue then flashes back to a time when his mother and father were loving and fun. Then, for some reason not explained in the book, his mother flipped. As quickly as a light switch can turn light to dark, Pelzer's mother turned from her loving ways to unrelenting directed anger and abuse.<br /><br />This is not a read for the feint hearted. The years of abuse, which are told in excruciating detail, were filled with repulsive acts of commission and omission.<br /><br />A new, young, temporary school teacher is the heroine. Not having any preconceived notions, she becomes curious about young Dave, his bruises, and his behavior. She alerts the school creating a cascade of events which lead to the unmasking of the abuse and Dave's release from evil.<br /><br />This book was written to awaken all of us to the existence of child abuse, and what a child goes through when it is at its worst.<br /><br />The book leaves the unanswered question of \\"why?\\" Why did his mother snap? Why did his dad stand by and not rescue his son? Understanding the catalysts is as important as the abuse itself.	2005-07-09

Of particular interest is how certain individuals can make correct, decisive, rapid fire decisions under conditions of high pressure and limited information. Gladwell explores how we reach these conclusions using our conscious - a logical and definitive path - and our subconscious - the adaptive path.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" not only explores the positive outcomes of the quick decision (at a glance) but also those decisions where our subconscious (instincts) betray us.<br /><br />This power of knowing, the subject at hand, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few but an ability we can all cultivate for ourselves. Gladwell discusses how it affects our relationships, our impressions of people, and how we evaluate circumstances that we face - both the familiar and the strange.<br /><br />You now have enough information, although limited, - in a blink -  to make a decision on whether or not this book is for you...	2005-07-05

And since the publication of Judith Viorst's \\"Necessary Losses,\\" transitions has become and increasingly popular subject for authors.<br /><br />Dotlich, Noel, and Walker in \\"Leadership Passages\\" cover thirteen common personal and professional passages (transitions) that they say make or break a leader...in fact, they can make or break any human, not just leaders. The authors based this book on their work as executives within major companies, business advisors and executive development consultants.<br /><br />Passages are predictable and inevitable. Most will go through more than one. Since passages are intense, they can destroy one's spirit. At the same time, they represent an opportunity as those who successfully navigate these difficult currents of life will experience real personal growth. And if not handled with emotional and intellectual honesty, these passages lead to danger.<br /><br />Most people, the authors have found, who move through life experiencing one success after another are shallow. They distinguish between the senior executive who has been strengthened and deepened by his/her passages and failure, from those who have not. The former are the most effective leaders.<br /><br />\\"Leadership Passages\\" is filled with examples and covers the following transitions.<br /><br />1. Joining a  company.<br /><br />2. Moving into a leadership role.<br /><br />3. Accepting the stretch assignment.<br /><br />4. Getting responsibility for a business.<br /><br />5. Dealing with significant failure for which you were responsible.<br /><br />6. Coping with a bad boss and competitive peers.<br /><br />7.

I would not, however, agree with Warren Buffet's jacket quote, \\"No other management book will ever be needed.\\"<br /><br />\\"Winning\\" is organized into five areas:<br /><br />Underneath It All<br /><br />Your Company<br /><br />Your Competition<br /><br />Your Career<br /><br />Tying Up Loose Ends<br /><br />The first two areas address mission, values, culture leadership, personal leadership, and human asset leadership. Much of this has been addressed by any number of books and with greater depth. What is remarkable is Welch's belief in institutionalization of these crucial elements. Many leaders of big companies talk a good game but few, if any, take convert the words to organizational behavior. Welch has.<br /><br />One section of the book that was most interesting was the one on competition. I was particularly appreciative of Welch's comments on strategy, and budgeting:<br /><br />\\"Forget the arduous, intellectualized number crunching and data grinding that gurus say that you have to go through to get strategy right. Forget the scenario planning, yearlong studies, and hundred-plus page reports.  They're time consuming and expensive. You just don't need them.\\"<br /><br />\\"It (strategy) is an iterative process and not nearly as theoretical of life-and-death as some would have you believe.\\"<br /><br />\\"...the budgeting process at most companies has to be the most ineffective practice in management...it sucks energy, time, and big dreams out of an organization. It hinders opportunity and stunts growth. It brings out the most unproductive behaviors in an organization, form sand bagging to settling for mediocrity.\\"<br /><br />This is a CEO after my own heart. He articulates why I left the corporate world for Silicon Valley. My world of fragile start-up companies and entrepreneurs, while not immune from some ineffectual strategizing and planning, is better at using time productively to create value. Why? Because all early stage companies exist at the edge of the abyss and it is always fighting for survival. Sand bagging and mediocrity are  immediately obvious and are not tolerated.<br /><br />The other section that was of interest to me was that on career. I have spent many hours, through my church, over the past four years with bright and well paid professionals who have suddenly lost their jobs due to the dot.com bust and/or the winds of economic change. Welch's words on career are a good read for all - whether in-transition or not.<br /><br />The only question left for Welch, which only time can answer, is whether or not his plan for winning will stand the test of time without Welch in the Quarterback role. Can his playbook continue to sustain a global behemoth like GE? We saw what happened here in San Francisco when Bill Walsh and Joe Montana left.

Robert Kagan, in his \\"Of Paradise and Power,\\" highlights the US's shift from multinationalism ot unilateralism. Now, George Weigel in his \\"The Cube and the Cathedral\\" shifts gears from political and economic differences to examine the growing spiritual and cultural disconnect that we have with Europe. These, he argues, are the deepest currents of history...and America and Europe are drifting apart.<br /><br />History is driven over the long haul by culture - by what men and women honor, cherish, and worship; by what societies deem to be true and good and noble; by the expressions they give to those convictions in language, literature, and arts; by what individuals and societies are willing to stake their lives on.<br /><br />Weigel traces Europe's contributions fostered by Christianity to culture that brought protection of human rights, promotion of the common good, the defense of  legitimate pluralism, and give an account of moral commitments that made democracy possible...all of which led to the great \\"American Experiment.\\"<br /><br />Now, Europe has created a new constitution, one whose preamble denies its very Christian heritage. Weigel argues that this is the culmination of a trend within \\"Old Europe\\" to a vacuous secularism. A shift from God to the new gods - secularist deities that have broken the bonds between faith and the will to a future, between the hope of a future and self-confidence.<br /><br />Weigel in his analysis goes on not only to warn Americans that the idea of shared Western civilization is becoming obsolete...and that the seeds of what Europe to its current state also show signs of life here in the US. We must be vigilant to insure that post-modernity secularism does not also bring the \\"American Experiment\\" to a silent disastrous conclusion.<br /><br />This is a good insightful read for those who are interested in underlying global trends.underlying global trends.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-27

Maturity, relationships, marriage, and parenting have been catalysts for the emergence of feelings that were buried and denied. Judith Wallerstein's excellent book provides the context and structure for my adult children to explore and understand their \\"new\\" feelings (and behaviors) enabling them to move-on, happier and emotionally healthier.<br /><br />My children, their spouses, and I have all read \\"Unexpected Legacy of Divorce.\\" We have and will continue to use the book as a resource in our on-going effort to get closure. We have all come to understand that the feelings and behaviors that are surfacing are not unique but, rather, are quite \\"normal\\" for children of divorce. This has been of great comfort for them - allowing them to cleanse the shadows of divorce and move forward with greater confidence that they are not weird.<br /><br />Wallerstein has conducted a longitudinal research study of divorce dating back to the late 1970's. \\"Unexpected Legacy\\" is the third and most recent book based on the study. In previous books, she has studied the effects of divorce, not only on children, as she has in this book, but also on the divorcing parents. All of the books are \\"must reads\\" for those who are considering divorce or have divorced.<br /><br />Over the years, I have had a number of people confide in me that either they or their spouses were considering divorce. My advice has always been to read Wallerstein's series to learn the variety of outcomes that can arise post-divorce and the strategies of those who faired best. Those considering divorce are all well advised to \\"do their homework.\\"<br /><br />These books are also a must read for anyone involved in family and/or divorce counseling - religious or secular counselors.<br /><br />In \\"Unexpected Legacy of Divorce,\\" the authors address the myth that the children will do fine if the parents are happy - divorced. Children, no matter how amicable and settled the parents are after divorce, suffer greatly. They lose their family, they lose control of their life (to the whims of parents and rules of courts), and they lose their childhood. All of these combine to provide a series of struggles as they move into adulthood and beyond.<br /><br />Important subject areas covered in this book include:<br />* The ghosts of childhood - the bottomline after 25 years<br />* The exploitation of children by divorcing parents<br />* The development path to adulthood being thrown out of sync<br />* Pushing a child's real feelings and thoughts underground by being busy<br />* Children trapped by real feelings and thoughts of the break-up<br />* Children dealing with the loss of THEIR nuclear family; the family that created them just vanishing - a loss that will be quietly or openly mourned throughout their lives.<br />* Why children turn on a parent(s) years later<br />* Children living with and coping with chaos<br />* Children and low self-esteem<br />* The missing father or mother after divorce<br />* Children growing up lonely<br />* Relationships with the \\"steps\\" (step-parents)<br />* The  loss of mom - whether or not she is physically available<br />* Court ordered visitation and its disruption of a \\"real\\" life for the children to make mom and dad complete<br />* Children of divorce taking the leap in relationships and marriages - the return of the relationship ghost<br />* The role of an intact family for modeling and shaping children whether their parents marriage is filled with joy, or loveless, or abusive<br />* Other residues of divorce for children - fear of loss, fear of change, fear that disaster will strike, especially when things aregoing well<br />* And the need for all involved in divorce, directly or indirectly, to be educated on all the issues that emanate from the divorce for children over their life as well as in the short term.<br /><br />This will not be an easy read for many. It was not intended to be. Nevertheless, the journey this book provides will be fruitful.<br /><br />I recommend this and Wallerstein's other books highly. These are an important books which will not diminish in value over time. These are classics.going well<br />* And the need for all involved in divorce, directly or indirectly, to be educated on all the issues that emanate from the divorce for children over their life as well as in the short term.<br /><br />This will not be an easy read for many.

Participants meet on Friday morning for breakfast and discussion of an assigned reading assignment relating to leadership. With Pat facilitating, participants learn leadership fundamentals from one another's experience and observations. The discussions are faith-based, robust and enlightening.<br /><br />Guiness' \\"When No One Sees\\" has been the book of choice this past year. It has been an excellent choice. It begins \\"by exploring the place of character in our Western Heritage, from the ideas of the Bible and Plato to Machiavelli and James Madison, and in real life, from Alexander the Great to Winston Churchill.<br /><br />Guiness' \\"then looks at the uncomfortable but inspiring role of suffering in forging - and exposing - character and at modern examples of erosion of character today.\\"<br /><br />The discussion then moves on to \\"an essential point: the cultivation of character - a powerful theme for centuries in Western Civilization and a key component of the 'good life' and 'good society.'\\"<br /><br />The author forces the reader (in our case, the group) to examine and self-determine whether or not character matters. If so, what are the correct practices, insights, and habits that lead to strong, value based character. And what are the underlying spiritual truths about character that are available to all  - truths that are profound, practical, revolutionary, and timely.<br /><br />\\"When No One Sees\\" is not light, bedtime reading. It is deep, thoughtful, and stimulating.	2005-05-20

Parker Palmer's \\"Let Your Life Speak\\" has more notations and highlights in its 109 pages than do most books 2-3 times its length. While the subject - how am I living my life? - is not new, Parker makes the book come alive by presenting old concepts in a new, unfamiliar way.<br /><br />The book is derived from essays Parker has published during the past decade. He does not present them as published, but rather he has rewritten them and developed the parts into a coherent whole.<br /><br />Chapter 1 challenges the reader to listen to life.<br /><br />Chapter 2 probes on how we become ourselves.<br /><br />Chapter 3 focuses on things of the past (the way closes) and things of the future (the way opens).<br /><br />Chapter 4 puts our personal infernos (all the way down) and the path to God into perspective.<br /><br />Chapter 5 brings the reader to the all-important \\"Leading from Within.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 6 uses the metaphor of seasons to relate to the realities of life.<br /><br />Some of the thoughts I have highlighted include:<br /><br />The self wants nothing more, or less, than for us to be who we were created to be - the \\"True self,\\" (our)true friend...(and) one ignores such friendship at one's peril.<br /><br />Burnout is a state of emptiness - trying to give what I do not possess.<br /><br />We are led to truth by our weaknesses as well as our strengths.<br /><br />The distortion of the true self comes from living from the outside in, rather than from the inside out.<br /><br />There are many, many more gems like these to meditate on, to move us, and to help us on the journey to our \\"True\\" selves.

And along with the lessons on leadership, Lowney's readers also get a great story on several important chapters in world history.<br /><br />Loyola builds on love driven leadership, an approach to leadership based on the notion that everyone has leadership potential, and true leaders unlock that potential in others. The how of unlocking potential is rooted in an orientation to \\"greater love than fear.\\" This notion of leadership fits well with the growing trend of \\"people centered leadership\\" as evidenced by best selling books authored by Pat Lencioni, John Maxwell, and others. This is a welcomed change from former corporate speak where sports figures and a towel snapping, take-no-prisoners model took center stage<br /><br />Lowney details Loyola's four pillars of success: self-awareness; ingenuity; love; and, heroism. The first step to leadership is self-leadership which springs from personal beliefs and attitudes. Throughout the book, Lowney highlights Loyola's belief that self-awareness is linked to leadership showing through example how leaders thrive by understanding who they are and what they value, by becoming aware of unhealthy blind spots or weaknesses that can derail them, and by cultivating the habit of continuous self-reflection and learning.<br /><br />Loyola's spiritually based approach to leadership also identifies attachments in life as obstacles to leading. He also underscores how ingenuity disposes people not to just think out of the box but to live outside the box.<br /><br />\\"Heroic Leadership\\" is organized around the following chapters:<br />Of Jesuit's and J.P. Morgan<br />What Leaders Do<br />The Jesuits<br />Leadership Role Models<br />\\"To Order One's Life\\"<br />The Spiritual Exercises<br />\\"The Whole World Becomes Our House\\"<br />\\"Refuse No Talent, Nor Any Man of Quality\\"<br />\\"An Uninterrupted Life of Heroic Deeds\\"<br />\\"Exceptional Daring Was Needed\\"<br />\\"The Way We Do Things\\"<br /><br />A strong leader relishes the opportunity to continue learning about self and the world and looks to new discoveries and interests. And real leaders - real heros - find fulfillment, meaning, and, yes, even success by shifting their gaze beyond self-interest and serving others. And they become greater - enhanced as persons - by focusing on something greater than self-interest alone.<br /><br />This is a book that most will use as a reference for years to come.alent, Nor Any Man of Quality\\"  \\"An Uninterrupted Life of Heroic Deeds\\"  \\"Exceptional Daring Was Needed\\"  \\"The Way We Do Things\\"    A strong leader relishes the opportunity to continue learning about self and the world and looks to new discoveries and interests.

For four years, I have been serving as a co-ministry head in my Church assisting those who are either \\"in-transition\\" or contemplating it. This has been my number one reading recommendation to all participants, as this book handily addresses the first step to be taken before one moves-on, the step of self-awareness. Without knowing you are and where you want to go, you are doomed to a very empty existence.<br /><br />Dorothy Cantor shares her twenty-five years of experience as a psychologist working with those who are seeking \\"what to do next\\" with key questions and real-life stories. While some, like me, may find the stories of little use, the questions she raises are the guts of the book and make this an excellent purchase. Some of these include:<br /><br />What will I be doing when I am no longer spending most of my time at the work I am doing now?<br /><br />What are the fifteen good things (besides money) that I get from job now?<br /><br />What was it that I first longed to be when I grew up?<br /><br />What are my obsession and reigning passions?<br /><br />Who are my heroes, my favorite or most unforgettable people?<br /><br />These and a host of other questions she raises will get one to think about their lives, their dreams, their gifts, their passions, and, ultimately, their direction. This is not a book to read quickly as this book requires the hard work of reflection and introspection to maximize its value.<br /><br />Cantor has authored a very readable and useful book in helping those who are searching to start the next chapter in their lives - possibly the most fruitful and meaningful	2005-04-17

The storyline follows one of Washington's most powerful, Joel Backman, after he is unexpectedly \\"pardoned\\" on the eve before the inauguration of a new president (remind you of the Clinton pardons?). Not only is Backman pardoned, but he is whisked off to Bologna, Italy under the protection and surveillance of the CIA.<br /><br />Backman, at the height of his power, became deeply involved in a scheme to sell Pakistani software that would render the satellite surveillance system of another foreign power useless. While this led to his imprisonment, it also kept him alive as US intelligence, the Saudis, the Israelis, and the Chinese all, for their own reasons, wanted him dead.<br /><br />The change of administrations and political winds, the firing of a longtime CIA director responsible for the Backman case, Backman's release and his adoption of a new Italian identity with Bologna as the backdrop, Backman's CIA handlers and the missteps of the CIA, the mysterious deaths of others involved in the software sale, a tenacious reporter, a new love, and the struggles of world powers are all woven into the fabric of this fast paced story.<br /><br />While there was much I enjoyed about the story, I found the ending to be unsatisfying.	2005-04-11

My guess is that both Crowley and Lodge are so much younger than last year that they now have time on their hands.<br /><br />Crowley and Lodge, I am sure, had fun writing this book (they said they did), but the first two thirds of the book was not fun to read. I felt like I was listening to two excited kids who forgot what they wanted to say. Crowley and Lodge get off tangent often and are extremely verbose.<br /><br />Written in a conversational style, the first two thirds of this book are devoted to the well worn topics of exercise and diet. Those who are already modestly familiar with physical fitness will not find anything new here...exercise, exercise, and exercise. And those who are modestly familiar with eating habits will not find anything new here...eat the right stuff, eat the right stuff, and eat the right stuff.<br /><br />The surprise, however, comes in the last third of the book which is devoted to emotional lifestyle issues - relationships, commitment to a purpose, and attitude. Crowley and Lodge correctly ascribe being younger next year not only to the usual, well written prescription of exercise and diet, but also, and importantly to one's emotional (and they hint at spiritual) state.<br /><br />It is this last third that makes the book a good purchase, and a welcomed addition to the literary arsenal for those wondering how to live \\"the last third\\" in the most satisfying way.	2005-04-11

As a lifelong Catholic, and one who has had the benefit of a great Catholic education from grade school through college, I have been looking for something outside the lay press that provides a thoughtful review of the present crisis in the Catholic Church, a review that provides history, perspective, and solutions. Weigel has done this in spades.<br /><br />Weigel marshals many facts that have not been reported as widely in the lay press as they should have been. He also gets at the gut issues of the laity, the priests, and episcopacy, and the role each has played in the present crisis. I am in full agreement that we need \\"more intelligent, evangelically assertive, courageous episcopal leadership in the Catholic Church in America.\\" I am also in full agreement that the laity must also be responsible for becoming more intelligent, assertive, and courageous.<br /><br />I have heard many Catholics and some priests express dissatisfaction with Pope John II and his teachings. This book along with reading some of Pope's publications has convinced me that much of what John Paul II was about was miscommunicated. And while he was a Pope for the times, he was way ahead of most and his influence will be felt positively for years to come.<br /><br />Weigel asserts that the Church is not ours, it is Christ's. \\"You did not choose me, but I chose you.\\" (John 15.16) With this fully in mind, the church must be reformed according to Christ's purpose not ours. With the passing of John Paul II, my bet is that those who favor \\"Catholic Lite\\" (Christ's purpose?) will be very much disappointed with our next pope.	2005-04-04

While omitted from the official reading list, it has been reported that Tom Wolfe's third novel is on President Bush's nightstand. I can understand why. Wolfe is a very good writer and with \\"I am Charlotte Simmons,\\" he captures cultural currents on today's college campus.<br /><br />If I had children on their way to college, I would have them read this, and then, I would invest time to discuss it with them. This is a morality story. One that is most instructive on  the consequences of poor decisions, even those that at first appear to be inconsequential.<br /><br />Hoyt is the seasoned player who uses his cunning to seduce unsuspecting freshmen women in an effort to maintain a stud reputation within his fraternity. He ultimately pays the price for his lack of character.<br /><br />JoJo is the all-star jock who does not want to look foolish to his peers by looking smart. So he plays dumb and almost loses it all.<br /><br />Adam is the nerd who is almost brought down by poor judgment when \\"doing his job\\" in tutoring JoJo.<br /><br />And Charlotte...she loses her innocence (and her character) in gaining the notoriety so many others seek. The twist is that she never wanted the notoriety nor sought it. In the end, her fate was influenced by her naivety and an environment she was unprepared to navigate.<br /><br />Finally, Wolfe's writing makes this story come alive for all. Consider,<br /><br />\\"Like Charlotte's eight hour, nine hour, ten hour interstate bus ride. In that period she has no duties, no obligations, no responsibilities, no one to confront because there is no one to confront.

Schuller is no ordinary elder statesman. While labeled a televangelist, Dr. Schuller is not just a televangelist. He has a broad mix of experiences that set him apart from his peers and others with his years. While a preacher and a very good one, he went against the grain of his own denomination by focusing not on sin but on HOPE. His entire ministry has been dedicated to helping all of us to \\"become what God wants us to be,\\" the essence of his \\"Possibility Thinking.\\"<br /><br />He gained great wisdom while pioneering (an entrepreneurs' entrepreneur)the creation of a mega-Church , the Crystal Cathedral; pioneering an international outreach via TV; and creating innovative ministries to heal and help many of those who are hurting or are in need.<br /><br />His influence here and abroad is readily apparent when one looks at the creation and expansion of other Churches who have adopted his \\"Mission\\" approach in reaching those who are seeking. The work of Rev. Bill Hybels, Willowcreek Church, (near Chicago), and Rev. Rick Warren (A Purpose Driven Life), Saddleback Church, (Orange County), are just two of Dr. Schuller's many students who bear witness to the fruit that has fallen from the Schuller tree.<br /><br />In \\"Don't Throw Away Tomorrow,\\" Dr. Schuller, with great personal stories and anecdotes, discusses the power of optimism; the importance of determining one's mission; choosing the values that are most important; living with a \\"right\\" conscience; measuring tomorrow's risks and rewards; communicating with honesty and clarity; understanding life's contradictions and one's assumptions: and the overall importance in believing for grand tomorrow.<br /><br />This is Dr. Schuller's finest book yet!

But for those like me, who chose math & science over arts & letters, this was a great read.<br /><br />Cahill takes the reader through the development of Greek culture, its merger with Roman culture, and, the merger of Greco-Roman culture with Judeo-Christian culture creating \\"the mighty torrent\\" of Western civilization. The last required the meshing of two separate ideas about the individual - the Greco-Roman's journey of individual public achievement (fate was central) with the Judeo-Christian's personal journey with God (hope was central).<br /><br />Each chapter had something to offer keeping the reader engaged throughout. I found many gems including but not limited to:<br /><br />- the Greeks created the first vowels significantly reducing the power of the scribes, who had a monopoly on interpretation. This, in turn,led to a free flow of ideas and speech.<br /><br />- the Greeks established public service without compensation.<br /><br />- Medea as a forerunner in women's rights.<br /><br />- the beginnings of social, political, and artistic study, and the love of wisdom.<br /><br />- the raising of fundamental questions like \\"What is the nature of reality?\\"<br /><br />- Greek warfare, and its implications today in the US' role as the sole world power.<br /><br />Cahill covers all the important classics like the Iliad and the Odyssey; the role of the Gods (Aphrodites exposed \\"the forbidden power of women\\" for the first time in history); the Persian Wars (if they had lost, Western civilization would not be what it is today); important figures like Sophicles, Plato, Phythagorus, Socrates (provided a radical challenge to the unexamined assumptions of Greek Life and the concept of forgiveness), Alexander the Great, and Peracles; and the invention of Theology, Philosophy, Ethics (How best to live), Political Science, Physical Science, Medicine, Psychology, and Mathematics.<br /><br />This book did what was intended - appreciating the Greek's role in the formation of Western Civilization - and will be a book I will refer to in the years to come.chology, and Mathematics.  <br /> <br />This book did what was intended - appreciating the Greek's role in the formation of Western Civilization - and will be a book I will refer to in the years to come.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

Shekerjian surfaces the common threads of attitudes and behaviors that foster creativity. Creatives can use this book to build on the \\"why\\" of their creativity with confidence.<br /><br />For those interested in developing their creative potential, the book eliminates the mystery and lays out the \\"how\\" of being creative. But to be successful, one needs to make an \\"act of faith\\" in the \\"act of doing.\\" Shekerjian's \\"doing\\" includes:<br /><br />1. Find your talent.<br /><br />2. Commit to it and make it shine<br /><br />3. Don't be afraid of risk. Or even failure, which if seen in its proper light, brings insight and opportunity.<br /><br />4. Find courage by looking to something stronger and better than your puny vulnerable self.<br /><br />5. No lusting after quick resolutions. Relax. Stay loose.<br /><br />6.

Risks outside the control of a venture's management team include the public equity and debt markets. Even with great potential and execution, a company's fortunes can be dealt a death blow by what is going on in these markets.<br /><br />The public equity market is critical in determining the valuation of a privately held company. One looks to the equity market for comparable public companies (further along in their development) for establishing valuation. If the company category is out of favor or declining or if the \\"window\\" for a public offering is closed, valuations are reduced and capital can be very difficult to raise. Likewise, if valuations are high and the \\"window\\" is open, valuations are higher and money is easier to get. I was forced in my role as a CEO to look at the events impacting the market in an attempt to 'time' financings. As most will tell you, this is an impossible task.<br /><br />As one who managed a start-up from concept to commercialization, raising money from both private and public investors, I found the Maestro to be a fascinating book. I lived ('survived' may be a better choice) through many of the ups and downs of the public market that are detailed in this book. When Greenspan and others were on the edge of the abyss, my company was there as well!<br /><br />It was instructive to learn about how Greenspan worked behind the scenes to set policy in motion to correct the economy and the public markets. His actions had a direct influence on the course, not only of mine, but of all development stage companies - impacting both positively and negatively the greatest source of US job growth over the last several decades.<br /><br />Woodward does a very good job articulating the tension that existed when disaster struck and the leadership Greenspan and Company provided in working to a positive result. An unexpected learning for me was the positive and courageous role President Bill Clinton filled in numerous 'against the grain' decisions. I came away with a more positive view of his presidency.<br /><br />Those who are dependent on public markets and those who want to understand the management of macro-economics in today's world will find this a good and instructive read.me was the positive and courageous role President Bill Clinton filled in numerous 'against the grain' decisions.

I have acted, until now, only on a \\"gut\\" feel when I needed to reach out for the opinion of a \\"crowd.\\" With \\"Wisdom of Crowds,\\" I am now armed some underlying principles that I can apply with confidence and insight... and, I suspect, with improved results.<br /><br />As a business executive in the medical technology industry, I have built numerous teams to either turn-around businesses or to build businesses. Success at these endeavors requires excellent problem identification and solving skills.  To increase the size of my \\"crowd\\" (the management team), I have created outside advisory groups, beyond the Board of Directors, to help in critical knowledge areas (medical, scientific, & marketing). These outside boards have proven invaluable in resolving important issues that were at hand or ahead.<br /><br />Early in my career, when promoted to a struggling division in my first general manager role, I resisted pressure from \\"corporate\\" to hire a medical director. The division served six surgical markets with multiple product offerings. I learned quickly that an internal medical \\"expert\\" would be a disaster. The Company's previous medical director had the nixed entry into numerous promising markets as well as killing several innovative product concepts. With time, both the markets and the products proved extremely profitable...for other companies.<br /><br />I learned to mistrust the so-called \\"expert\\" and, instead, created outside advisory boards that would provide a broad range of independent views. I have never looked back and continue to use this concept today. The use of the \\"crowd\\" does not make life easier as a big burden is shouldered by the management team in listening to the \\"aggregated\\" view, and in making the final decision. The result, however, was a full pipeline of new products, with several mega-hits.<br /><br />Surowiecki outlined the \\"how\\" in using the crowd. His emphasis on 1) diversity of opinion, 2) independence of members from one another...something hard to achieve internally, 3) decentralization, and 4) a good method for aggregation of opinions provided invaluable insights.<br /><br />As a side note, I followed the Iowa Electronic Market during the 2004 Presidential Election cycle.

Partners? Lifestyles?<br /><br />* Are we looking back now to see that what we chose, at that time, is what we are today? Did we find what we were seeking?<br /><br />* Did we realize that everything else would be sucked away?<br /><br />* Now that the turbulent world of youth and early adulthood has receded, are we vested in the fantasy that there will still be splendid things to come?<br /><br />* Do we sort of wonder who won't make it to the next reunion?<br /><br />The interplay of these characters, their getting re-reacquainted, and the sharing of their stories will break down walls for even the most stoic.

It was most helpful in understanding much of what went on behind the scenes in Washington, Europe, and, most importantly, the Mid-East, as we prepared for and then executed our invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br />Those who were throwing darts at President Bush would have been well-served by reading Frank's accounts - of how he was the principle architect in the reshaping of the military for \\"speed, agility, and cooperation\\"; the international intelligence community's beliefs about Iraq and its arsenal; and, of the assets he requested for battle operations (he was not limited in his requests).<br /><br />The book really picks up with Desert Storm and the on-going problems of the Mid-East. There is something for everyone in Frank's recounting of these critical years in which America's foreign and military policy was radically reshaped.<br /><br />In addition, most will find his portraits of those he met, served with, and worked for to provide additional insights into how our country functions through the many professionals who have dedicated their lives in the cause of freedom - for us and for those who suffer under repressive regimes.	2004-11-14

All three are imperfect. Levitt exposes many of the abuses that have been known to most public market insiders. He has done much, helped by the market meltdown in 2000-02, to rectify some of these abuses.<br /><br />He provides extensive background, from his point of view, on the difficulty of making the markets more transparent and consumer (retail) friendly. He details his butting heads with Wall Street chieftains, corporate CEOs, the high tech industry, and the very agencies and oversight boards charged with insuring fair markets.<br /><br />There are many gems that are instructive. For instance, I was surprised to learn about the matching of buyers and sellers within a single organization, like Schwab, that increased profits...but to the detriment of customers. Now that there are new rules on this, I understand why Schwab and others are struggling with profitability and must redefine themselves. Schwab's success initially was derived from a rules change Charles Schwab supported, and now its difficulties are derived from a rules change the firm fought.<br /><br />Levitt also shows regulatory zeal in areas requiring much more discussion and debate to insure the public good. Single-minded regulators, while they can do good, can also inflict great harm. While stock options may need a change in accounting treatment, we must  make sure that we understand the \\"how\\" to insure that we do not drive a stake into development stage companies that have led the world in innovation, job creation, and value creation. Levitt's single-mindedness on this issue is scary.<br /><br />He showed ignorance about development stage companies and the role of stock options. He frequently used companies like Cisco, Microsoft, and Intel as examples in his discussion. These are growth companies but they are no longer development stage companies. Stock options are a critical tool for the growth and survival of a true development stage company. Most, if not all, development stage firms only offer healthcare benefits, non-matching 401k plans, and an opportunity to fail (80% fail). Stock options provide an off-set to the personal and career risk one takes to join a start-up.<br /><br />Development stage companies have proven crucial to the health of the US economy with jobs, and global leadership in areas like health and high-tech. We are the envy of the world. We as country must make sure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.<br /><br />Those who are interested in these subjects and controversies will enjoy getting a behind the scenes view, courtesy of Arthur Levitt.

The psychological shifts that accompany the situational shifts can be difficult for people and must be managed to have everyone on board.\\" Change and transition management is crucial to focus, execution, and organizational productivity.<br /><br />Those of us experienced in start-up management know first hand the changes that we will have to manage - some expected, some unexpected. But few of us have been schooled in the management of the transition that accompanies change. Generally, decisions to create change are made and implemented whether the people are on board or not. A spirit of \\"they will have to just accept them\\" is the operative mantra.<br /><br />But, as Bridges points out so well, we can do much to ease these transitions and keep our employees \\"on-board and involved.\\" It is self-defeating to try to overcome people's resistance to change without addressing the threat that change poses to their world. For successful change to take place, people must have a purpose, a mental picture, a plan for, and a part to play in change. In short, successful change takes place only when everyone is actively involved.<br /><br />Key changes that create transitions that must be managed in a start-up include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />* The addition of new functions.<br /><br />* The addition/replacement of key executives.<br /><br />* The addition/replacement of key board members.<br /><br />* The addition of new, actively involved investors.<br /><br />* Significant workforce expansion/reduction.<br /><br />* Relocation to larger facilities.<br /><br />* The relocation of some functions to a second facility.<br /><br />* The addition of new actively involved investors.<br /><br />* The infusion of significant new capital.<br /><br />* The move from project management to multi-functional management.<br /><br />* The move from being privately held to being publicly held.<br /><br />* Events that affects cash usage, business value, and the ability to raise capital.<br /><br />Bridges shows us that transitions are a process by which people unplug from an old world and plug into a new world. They start with an ending and finish with a beginning. Once he explains the three phases of transition, he goes on to show how to manage the entire process.<br /><br />B-schools would be well advised to include a transition management course in their entrepreneurial studies programs.

He accurately captures the personalities, the behaviors, and the ethos of Wall Street from 1990 to the bust. The most unfortunate thing about this period, which Kessler does not mention, is that some great innovations and good young companies had their fates sealed by those who were (mis)guided by greed and fame. All of us were the losers as this was not a zero sum game.<br /><br />I urge Kessler to write again, this time on the subject of hedge funds and short positions. While hedge funds and short positions can serve a positive purpose in correcting stocks that are overpriced, they can also be a real challenge for young, fragile companies. Short positions are taken with the HOPE that the value of the company will decline significantly. Today, as in the late 90's, some of those with short positions will do whatever it takes to drive a stock price down, including the spreading of lies. Young companies need to focus on execution. They do not have the time nor resources to fend off the swirl of lies that go hand in hand with large short positions. There is no transparency here as with other investment instruments. As such, there is room for plenty of mischief.<br /><br />This is a must read for any development stage CEO or CFO. For those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. Despite the attempts by Spitzer and others, the pattern of the late 90's will again emerge, albeit in a different form.	2004-08-29

If you enjoy Renaissance History, Art History, and/or Religious History, you will enjoy this book. It combines all three into a compelling story about Michelangelo's breakthrough as one of, if not the, world's the greatest artist(s). The setting is Rome in the reign of Pope Julius II - the war Pope, and megalomaniac.<br /><br />Michelangelo's breakthough as an artist is deeply intertwined with the Julius II. The Pope's desire to bring Italy back under the Vatican's control, his focus on bringing honor to himself through the arts, and his penny pinching ways are all key elements in Michelangelo's journey to greatness.<br /><br />While the book covers all of Michelangelo's life, the focus is on the four years it took to paint the Sistine Chapel vault. Author Ross King includes stories of Michelangelo's family, disputed loves, contemporaries (Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and others), and the intricacies of sculpting, oil painting, and frescoing. As an oil painter myself, I found these details of great interest, as I take for granted how much easier it is today to get the right materials than 500 years ago.<br /><br />One takeaway from this book is why the young Martin Luther, a priest, was so distraught after his stay in Rome. The role of the Church as an extension of Christ's life, and as a light for all, was subverted by greed, power, and, while not covered here, lust. This period contributed mightily to the Protestant Reformation which followed shortly after this period.<br /><br />Those who read \\"The Agony and the Ectasy\\" will be disappointed to find that much in that book was not fact. King, based on more recent evidence, has re-written the story of this great artist making it the most up-to-date biography for this period in his life. This is a book rich with history, and is not a quick read. If you are one to listen to books on tape/CD while you workout, as I do, this is a perfect way to stretch your mind as you stretch your muscles. Alan Sklar does an excellent job narrating.	2004-08-29

I have been involved with innovations in cardiovascular surgery, neurosurgery, gastrointestinal surgery, ophthalmology, plastic surgery, Ob/Gyn, urology, and hearing.  Edward Tanner in \\"Our Own Devices\\" articulates and provides structure for what I have observed with new medical technologies, their adoption, and evolution. This book will be of interest and important to those who are participants in and/or students of technological innovation.<br /><br />Oftentimes, those involved in the development of technology work in a vacuum without consideration of the user, trends, cultural barriers, and trade-offs - between performance, symbolism, and behavior changes. Tanner goes into great detail with examples showing the development and evolution of everyday items like shoes, sofas, and eyeglasses to highlight how things really went with these \\"machines,\\" as they were put to use.<br /><br />\\"Our Own Devices\\" is an exploration not only of inventive genius but also of user ingenuity. New devices are intended to change behavior, but not always as we imagined. And changes in behavior inspire new improvements and/or new devices, which in turn leads to more innovations. A good example of this in medical technology is the Swan-Ganz catheter. It was introduced in the late 1960s for use as a diagnostic tool for cardiologists. It had limited success until the mid-1970s when anesthesiologists adopted it for use to manage critical care patients in surgery. Until its use, many critical care patients were too high risk for surgery. About the same time, other innovators adopted some of its features to create the angioplasty catheter to treat vascular occlusions. This catheter has now become the primary tool in treating clogged arteries, and has further  evolved to deliver a stent, and, more recently, a drug coated stent.

Unfortunately, I found this book tough going. I had to slog through the first half of the book. The second half was redeeming with its reminders of how a man should treat other people, in particular women. I have given the book to my son and have advised him to begin with Chapter Ten, \\"The Lady.\\" If he starts any sooner, I am afraid that he will never get beyond the first twenty or so pages, and will miss the wisdom that Hall has provided in Chapters 10-15.	2004-08-16

I have had the honor of knowing Ram Charan since 1981. He was, at that time, a lecturer for our in-house corporate (American Hospital Supply Corporation) training program for company Presidents at Northwestern University. Once exposed to this great business mind and teacher, I hired him to work with me and my team in my Division, and subsequently with a medical technology, development stage company (KeraVision,Inc.) I led from idea conception to commercialization.<br /><br />There is no better way to access his wisdom than through direct interaction and involvement in your business. He will take your mind, expand it, then teach you how to apply all that he has shared. He does not tell you what to do but, rather, provides the structure within which you can determine what needs to be done.<br /><br />His work with teams of people (executive teams, boards, boards & executive teams) is pure genius. He extracts every idea, and every possibility from the group, then provides the means to look at the information and gain new insights.<br /><br />One thing that is not discussed about Ram in reviews of his work is his humanity. He is truly a believer in people. He pushes hard for the elimination of non-productive and destructive people (and what this book is all about, projects) because he knows the importance of the organizational health. He knows that healthy organizations retain excellent people, grow excellent people, and produce quality results.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not everyone can work directly with Ram, so this book and others that he has authored are the next best thing. This book is no exception as it provides a basis for focus, investment of time and capital, and growth. And, if you read carefully, it is laced with his humanity.	2004-08-16

I have watched Gergen as a pundit for years and thought that he, while articulate, was a little too milktoast for me. I picked up this book on a lark, and once I began to read it, never set it down.<br />I have read countless business books on leadership in business. Most, if not all, paint the picture of the perfect unerring leader. Gergen, on the other hand, writes about what he observed - the strengths and the warts of those he served while in the White House. As a result, he has written what has become my favorite book on leadership.<br />Leaders come in different shapes and sizes, with different skills and experiences. And Gergen shows how each of these Presidents used their unique skills and experience to lead. Some better than others.<br />This is a book that should be a must read in all MBA programs as it tells the story of real leadership and not some fictional, unattainable ideal.	2004-06-30
US	52555618	R32MFG5DIC96EK	0399151648	583255343	Kate Remembered	Books	5	5	7	N	N	My Favorite Aunt	On June 3, 2004, Sotheby's opened an exhibition of Kathryn Hepburn's property which will be auctioned off from her estate. Sotheby's had inquiries from all over from fans to advanced collectors to galleries. What is it about this star that has created such interest in owning a piece of this star?<br />Scott Berg, who had long personal friendship with Hepburn, does an excellent job in providing a behind the scenes glimpse into her life, what made her tick, and possibly, why she has been so attractive to so many.  \\"Kate Remembered\\" is a well-written, fast-paced biography. This is a biography written with the reader in mind.<br />Berg describes the source of her fierce independence and her moves from stage to movies and later to TV. He also gives us a glimpse of some of the biggest names in Hollywood during her era, and the role Louis Mayer and Sam Goldwyn played in shaping their careers. He spares no details of her relationships with George Stevens, Cary Grant, Howard Hughes, Leland Hayward, and, of course, Spencer Tracy.<br />Learn about her views of Sir Laurence Olivier (a \\"small\\" man), John Wayne, Timothy Dalton, Peter O'Toole, and Bob Hope (a big egomaniac), Warren Beatty (vanity), Michael Jackson (a ten year old boy in 25 year old body), and her favorite movies.<br />While Hepburn stood alone with her fierce independence, beauty, and brains, Berg shows us that this hardly defined the feisty woman from Connecticut. She was a woman \\"with attitude\\" not caught up with Hollywood, a woman who was grounded, a woman who never developed a sense of entitlement, and, yet, a woman who had few friends as she got older.<br />Berg goes into great detail about why Tracy was the event in her life that taught her how to love rather than seeking to be loved; why Judd Harris tired to destroy her after she resurrected her career; why she felt she could never attend the Academy Awards; and how \\"The Philadelphia Story,\\" which saved her career, was created and produced.<br />Some of the book's priceless quotes include:<br />Her response after Sean Penn punched out a photographer... \\"Why wouldn't someone who pays to see your picture in the movies, not want to take your picture?\\"<br />On her profession...\\"Actors and actresses are prostitutes selling themselves for our  entertainment.\\"<br />On having children... She never wanted to have to make the choice between giving a scheduled performance or staying home to care for a sick screaming child.<br />\\"Life, it is not easy. Life is tough for everyone, most become its victim.\\"<br />She was the keeper of her own flame, and while she maintained a starry distance, she always seemed like our favorite aunt. And Berg's book tells us why, she was our favorite aunt!<br />We are fortunate for her enduring relationship with Scott Berg that made this book possible.the book's priceless quotes include:<br />Her response after Sean Penn punched out a photographer... \\"Why wouldn't someone who pays to see your picture in the movies, not want to take your picture?\\"<br />On her profession...\\"Actors and actresses are prostitutes selling themselves for our  entertainment.\\"<br />On having children...

As her conditioned worsened, she was unable to get to Church. One Sunday she stumbled onto the &quot;Hour of Power&quot; and found it a source of spiritual nourishment. She quickly became a weekly viewer and told all of her great discovery.<br />I have watched &quot;The Hour of Power&quot; off and on ever since. I have  been intrigued with the simplicity of his message and the corresponding expansion of his ministry to Europe, Russia, and now, the Far East.<br />While Rev. Robert Schuller is unique in modern US Religious History, he is, more importantly, unique as a great US ambassador. Each week, he shows the world the goodness of this country. And though being grounded in Christ's Word, his spiritual outreach is for all faith traditions.<br />This autobiography, &quot;My Journey,&quot; tells his story. While a bit too detailed, and too wordy (515 pages), those that have an interest in this man and his ministry should find it a good read.	2004-06-08

I have had the opportunity over the past few years to participate in an executive and professional non-denominational fellowship facilitated by the former (1980's and 1990's) Chaplain of the San Francisco 49ers. The focus of our meetings is leadership and &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; We have used books by Maxwell, Lencioni, and others to draw on for discussion. Daisy Wademan's book will fit right into our program. She has, through her professors, provided us with much to think about and to discuss.<br />For those want to improve their lives as leaders, form a small group of 6-8 people with peers (but not from the same organization), meet once a week for one hour, and use books like this to center your discussion. This one works well as it is well organized (one professor per session) and very well written. Hopefully, Ms. Wademan will follow in the footsteps of Maxwell, and Lencioni providing us with a stream of books to work with. She is off to a grand start!	2004-05-24

Before I chose one of his works, I decided to purchase this book to determine first of all, whether I wanted to spend time with Chesterton, and secondly, if I did, where do I start. Ahlquist has done an excellent job in drawing me in. I am hooked and will begin in earnest. I was fascinated to read passages that Chesterton wrote in the early 20th Century that apply just as well to events in the world today. Common sense is timeless.<br /><br />There is so much to quote from. For instance...\\"Chesterton says men do not grow tired of evil but of good. They stop worshipping God and start worshipping idols, their own bad imitations of God, and they become as wooden as the thing they worship. They start worshipping nature and become unnatural. They start worshipping sex and become perverted. Men start lusting after men and become unmanly.\\"<br /><br />And this was written nearly 100 years ago...Get yourself this book and get hooked on common sense.	2004-03-13

While he is gone, his book, \\"The Discoverers\\" will be with us for many years as a classic.<br />I have been in both multi-national and venture environments for thirty years, bringing pioneering advanced medical technologies to the global marketplace. When I stumbled onto \\"The Discoverers\\" in 1987, I could not put it down. This is a must book for anyone involved in the process of discovery.<br />Boorstin clearly shows that discovery is the adventure of discovering a fundamental truth... While the earth has always been round and bacteria have been here longer than mankind, our understanding of fundamental 'truths' like these took years to discover. Money, prestige, power, suppressed independent thinking, and laziness all combined to create a 'group think,' a status quo, that was difficult to change. Boorstin shows how 'group think' worked against the acceptance of new ideas, and the eventual discovery of truth. Those who are involved in discovery will recognize that these same obstacles stand in our way today.<br />I have purchased 50+ copies since I bought my first copy. I have given them as gifts to others who have dedicated their lives as entreprenuers, scientists, and/or venture capitalists in an effort to creating a better world. This is a book that tells their story and why they must not give up.	2004-03-08

Bryson does a masterful job in providing a easily understood overview of how we got to where we are and a framework for understanding the significance of where we are going. &quot;A Short History About Nearly Everything&quot; is an easy and fun read for all. With it, you will no longer be an uninterested spectator to the fundamental events shaping what we know, where we are going, and, most importantly, who we are in the 21st Century.	2004-03-07

Creating value by managing risk and uncertainty has been the core of my life's journey. It has been filled with complexity, tension, and dissonance...but it has also been filled with the discovery of possibility and meaning. The Zanders have done a real service in framing the &quot;how&quot; of possibility with their examples and practices.<br />This gem of a book will be useful not only in managing one's life, but also in helping other's to create their great life stories. The answers to core questions like &quot;which game of success will I choose to play?&quot;,&quot;will I choose to be a contribution?&quot;, and &quot;do I take myself too ___seriously?&quot; are keys to a life of joy, meaning, and fulfillment.<br />Can you see the work of art within you? Within others? Or are you focusing on the facade? Who is winning the battle between the caculating self and the central self? Are you vulnerable or are you permeable? What is here now? And what do you want to do from here? Get yourself this book and engage in THE joyous adventure of opening up to your possibilities.	2004-02-22

All of the founders have been in the sales, marketing, and/or advertising fields for years. But, this is the first time any of us have been involved in a business that will live or die solely on creating &quot;awareness of&quot;, &quot;interest in&quot;, and &quot;demand for&quot; with women.<br />I found Marketing to Women, read it cover to cover (I could not put it down), and have now made it mandatory reading for anyone associated with our company. Barletta offers great insights and provokes &quot;out of the box thinking.&quot;<br />As an extra aside, I learned a lot about female buying habits (Eg. women need to find the perfect answer) that, in the past, frustrated me. This book has and will continue improve my relationship not only with my female customers, but also, and probably most importantly, with my wife, and daughter.	2004-01-28

The time I spent with people who were dying became THE touchstone for the rest of my life. These fine people, more than any other group, taught me the truths of life and how to live it with purpose and meaning.<br />If you (most people I have met do) are in need of an Extreme Makeover when it comes to your life, \\"Not Fade Away\\" does not disappoint. Some of the takeaways include:<br />\\"When you really grasp death, it is one of life's defining moments...nothing looks quite the same again...<br />If you've always got your health, you can always make money. But all the money in the world can't buy back your health.<br /><br />You will never accomplish anything if you're afraid to look bad trying.<br /><br />And, why do we lose that feeling, that sense of wonder, for so much of our lives?\\"<br />Redeem yourself...and your life with this very thoughtful and provocative book.	2004-01-26

(I have since bought four copies of it for others) Once done, they suggested I get a copy of \\"Renovation..\\" I did so in mid-2002 but took a year to get around to it. Wish that I had read it sooner.<br />I have just finished reading it and can report that I found the book totally absorbing. I am a business executive and find Willard's words relevant to the times, not just in business, but for all walks of life in our society.<br />I was going to skip the last sections on the Congregation but ended up reading them. I am glad I did. He makes some great points on what Churches should be, as many have lost their way.<br />Those of us who consider ourselves part of the Church can work not only for our own \\"Renovation of Heart\\" but for that also of the Church. Willard shows us what to focus on.<br />There are other reviews here that do a better job in reviewing content. My purpose is only to say that this book is not just for members of the religious, or those who consider themselves religious, but for all.<br />I have gained immensely from reading this book...a book I will read over and over again.	2003-05-21

Ms. Thomas beautifully illustrates the serendipity of life and its impact on our life's direction.  Her collaborators share their stories of events and words that shaped their lives...for some it was a subtle word, for others it was a major event.<br />As important as these words and events were, they were not as obvious for those transformed until years later when they could look back seeing the fork in the road and the direction the event/word took them.  The shared stories come from all walks of life.  The book is a good reminder for all on how each of us has the power to impact and transform another's life in a positive way every day.<br />This is a great gift idea, especially for those who are in transition (between careers or stages of life), or are weathering one of life's storms.	2002-09-15
