By trashing her own mother's name for millions she is doing God's work. She  mocks gays, tells her son he's possessed by Satan, and generally claims  God's authority for her own. Sadly, her frenzy is not able to energize the  prose. Shame!	2000-05-26

King crafted some very believable BOY children, but the role of the one girl was inexcusably offensive and exploitative. I have to admit that this is the most terrifying novel I have  ever read. But despite its effective frightening powers, because of the bad  plotting, outrageous sexism, lack of economy of writing, and horribly lame  ending, I have to give it only two stars.

This is exactly the year when the events  of the novel were projected to take place, and what is most fascinating is  how differently history actually turned out than Bradbury imagined.  Published in 1950, Bradbury never foresaw the civil rights movement and the  integration of all races in this country. Instead, while still muttering  &quot;yessirs&quot; and deferring to the white man, every single black  citizen of the US flees to Mars to be free. Women are also frozen in time  in his depiction of the future, with the more subtle issues of  discrimination and reproductive freedom completely ignored. It just goes to  show you what a dramatic effect political organization and protest can  really bring. But let me step off my soapbox to finally say that this is  definitely a classic work of science fiction to wrap your mind around.	1999-06-18

Hyman is such a twit that she finds her mother's passing off frozen  macaroni &amp; cheese as homecooked equally as offensive as alcoholism and  suicidal tantrums. This book is her malicious, last ditch effort to drain  more money out of her mother--if no longer directly from her pockets, then  from her name.

Much of it is a description of trying to survive an incredibly long and harsh journey through endless miles of snow. The interesting ideas about politics and gender seemed  brushed aside in favor of lengthy poetic descriptions of snow that even  eskimos would find tiring.

The writing is bad, the characters are thinly drawn, and  the story is just a bastardized version of the real Andrews' novels. I  thought the market for the &quot;girl who is partially orphaned, then  betrayed by adoptive parents, then falls in forbidden incestuous love with  some relative, and then is raped by some other relative&quot;-story was  called the porn industry.

The growing love between two teenaged girls is drawn sensitively and realistically. The only reason I  didn't give it five stars is because the way that everyone they know just  wholeheartedly embraces their open lesbianism is unbelievable.

The 1st novella &quot;Stained with Crimson&quot; was disjointed and vague  with uncompelling characterizations. Just a hazy vampire tale. The 2nd  novella &quot;Malice in Saffron&quot; was both depraved and beautiful in a  way that only Tanith Lee seems to be able to pull off. It haunted me for  days afterward, this brutal tale of revenge &amp; redemption, highlighting  the state of affairs for young girls in pre-renaissance times. The  characters were unforgettable, making this my favorite of the 20 or so  novels I've read by her. The 3rd novella &quot;Empires of Azure&quot; was a  fun ghost story, kind of in a classic mid-century scifi style, with the  glamour and mystery of decadent 1920s Paris culture. Overall, definitely  worth reading. Tanith Lee's writing is like candy.	1999-06-11

The female characters are fascinating, but the male characters seem 2-dimensional (although, this may not be unrealistic). The main character's best friend Keiko is one of  the wildest, most interesting characters I've seen in print! It reads more  like a poem, gritty and brilliant and chaotic, with the voice often  changing from character to character, giving an even broader portrait of  the dynamics at play. My only complaint was that the story seemed to  wander, giving it an almost Kerouac-type feel, seeming more incidental than  integral, more like a biography in poem than a novel. Overall, it was a  great read which I devoured in two days, and I look forward to more of Ms  Hagedorn's work.	1999-06-11

This story starts off great with a bizarre tall quasi-human (Taltos) character, who's a glamorous NY businessman, haunted by his idyllic homeland and destroyed past. Then, Rice goes on for hours about who knows  what happened when like a court stenographer's printout, with nothing  remotely interesting happening until the very end where they lope off into  the sunset in a pure cheesy cowboy romance. Not too horrible for falling  asleep to--I used these tapes to combat insomnia--but definitely poor.	1999-06-11

The idea of a Romeo &amp; Juliet story played differently in a parallel universe is charming, but probably only merits a  short-story or novella length work. 400 pages of tiresome infighting  between the houses of swaggering Italian stallions causes the eyelids to  droop. The characters of substance are peripheral, and we're expected to  care about the traumas that befall the vain &amp; vacuous. Not even her  lovely prose, extensive colorful vocabulary, and the occasional interesting  passages can save this novel from being an utter bore.	1999-06-11
