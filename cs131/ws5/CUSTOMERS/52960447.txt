I understand and recognize criticism of Nader regarding his role in the 2000 election, and back then I was annoyed at him for it.

Chomsky reminds us of the USA's own spotted history of supporting/perpetrating &quot;terrorism&quot; in places like Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cuba, Sudan, etc.<br />I have been personally disappointed with the media and the public's overall reaction to 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan since.  The mainstream media needs to give more air time to people like Chomsky so his type of views enter the public debate.<br />The book's only real liability (and it is explained several times in the forward and in editors' notes) is that as the book consists largely of interviews conducted by phone/email with reporters around the world, there is some repetition of points Chomsky makes (although the editors pruned a great deal of repetition out, according to the notes).  There is also some awkward language, presumably due to English being a second language for many of the reporters involved.<br />Another important book by Chomsky.	2002-03-03

One of my favorite things about traveling is the time it gives me to read and I especially enjoy reading science fiction.  Whether the reading takes place on an airplane or in Paris or Bangkok its time well spent!<br />All of the stories selected are excellent.  They are all travel stories that most people can relate to on some level.<br />I love getting short story anthologies because they give you a chance to try a number of different authors and short stories lend themselves to a busy schedule.

Cordwainer Smith (a pen name) didn't write much science fiction - most of what he wrote is contained in this single anthology of his short stories.<br />These stories are loosely bound together through a universe populated with genetically modified humans and animals, sub-races, strange computers, immortality, drugs and ancient, crumbled cities.<br />If you are looking for something different in science fiction you should definitely try this one.  I believe that a similar anthology is available in the form of an out-of-print paperback.	2002-02-23

It was a light, easy read and it was quite funny. I like Jon Ronson and I admire him for his courage.<br />I'm not sure how much of the book I believe. I think that in a general sense it is probably all true-to-life but some of the specifics must have been embellished, if only to make them funnier. The occasional lack of believability doesn't make the book less enjoyable.<br />Mr. Ronson showed a great deal of the human side of the extremists he studied. His exploration of the events behind the Ruby Ridge incident was particularly poignant.<br />I'd like to see a followup story that describes the reactions of the people he interviewed for this book at having their stories published, having fun poked at them, etc. I wonder which of them (if any) were flattered/angry/pleased, etc. by it.<br />This book was one of my favorite reads of the winter.	2002-02-12

It also provides some fantastic historical insight into Paris, particularly with regards to 20th century Parisian history.<br />It is printed on a pulpy paper and is very light, something to keep in mind if you are just packing a single bag and taking off to Paris for the weekend.	2001-09-05

After reading the books I even discovered that the Hottentots Venus' pickled &quot;friend&quot; is indeed at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris.

A friend of mine loaned me this book and it sat on my shelf for several months.  I brought it with me on a trip and eventually picked it up.  Once I started I couldn't stop!  This is fascinating science fiction told primarily from the perspective of two narrators.  The stories are [to a certain extent] set at the turn of the century and center around the experiences of a one-time British soldier in the Raj in India.  The book is a worthy read for the colorful descriptions of India and other Asian locales alone, however it is the science fiction and irony throughout the rest of the story that carry it along.  Don't let the word &quot;Romance&quot; in the title fool you - its not that type of Romance novel.  One word of caution: Probably less appealing to those who abhor prison or war stories.  For the rest of us?  Woohoo!	2001-08-22
