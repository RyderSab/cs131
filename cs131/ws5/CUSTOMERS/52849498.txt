Abraham Lincoln is revered by lawyers everywhere for his courtroom skills and practical wisdom. The Lincoln Michael Connelly refers is not Abraham, but rather the automobile.<br /><br />Mickey Haller, son of an original Los Angeles superstar lawyer, owns several. At times the limousine business seems preferable to his own. But finally he gets, to his eternal regret the \\"franchise case\\", the kind of case that not only pays the bills but causes other clients to want his services.<br /><br />A young rich real estate broker is charged in the attempted murder of a hooker. His insistence in his innocence causes Haller to realize he may have what he has always dreaded, the actually innocent client. But he finds his defense efforts in disarray as the case sours, and he himself becomes a murder suspect.<br /><br />Non-lawyers usually do not write good legal thrillers. Michael Connelly, a former reporter and America's best mystery writer, is the exception that proves the rule. He has a great ear for the courtroom and a sense of the professional and economic dilemmas trial lawyers face.<br /><br />I will say this, however, in real life no matter how secret the client confidence, lawyers are ethically able to access the expertise necessary to know how to respond to any dilemma in an ethically sound way. The real Mickey Haller would have picked up the phone to the Bar's hotline for an ethics opinion. That simple act would have destroyed a helluva tale.<br /><br />I hope we will see more of Haller. He has his demons but he is not as dark a protagonist as Harry Bosch. The reality is, in his first legal thriller, Connelly has produced a book every bit as good as John Grisham's A Time To Kill. That is saying a lot.	2005-10-08

Tom Hanks will soon star as Charlie although it unclear which Charlie he will be. <br /> <br />Some of the reviews from former Soviet soldiers have tempered my amusement with Wilson's antics. Young men died in  service of their country, while America's warriors sat on the sidelines using proxies. <br /> <br />The fact is that war is war and under our Constitution the role of the President is to wage it and the Congress to fund it. It is a wise allocation of power...Congress has the right to quit funding a war, but to fund a war that an administration does not seek is reckless.  <br /> <br />Hopefully future Congressmen will not usurp executive authority as Wilson did. He may have been a character but that is not enough.	2005-09-21

Since well over half the reading public is female, the first sentence of this review should say it all. Consequently it is to that portion of the audience that, like me, is male this review is addressed. <br /> <br />Most guys think of girl buddy events as something to be avoided. Indeed there is quite a bit of female information that most guys would just as soon not know. \\"Shall we go to the bathroom? \\" the African-American buddy asks. \\"Of course, we're girls,\\" relies her Italian-American buddy. One buddy hides her piece in her panties, another fears that if her concealed weapon discharges it could \\"take out an ovary.\\" Makeup tips, man trouble, and poor driving habits flesh out the dialog. <br /> <br />Vicki Allegretti, a former Philly Assistant D.A., has a new job in the U.S. Attorney's Office. Her ATF partner dies during an interview with a confidential informant when a home invasion intervenes. Vicki quickly winds up in serious trouble when she beats up a defendant during a pretrial meeting because she's convinced the defendant knows who killed her partner. After the defendant is released on bail and her own mother is killed she teams. <br /> <br />In a junked Sunbird they chase dopers around the inner city and witness the Toys R Us massacre where seven dopers, mothers and babies are mowed down. Needless to city the City of Brotherly Love is very much the town without pity. Despite the assignment of every cop and federal agent in the city to the investigation, it is the chicks in the Sunbird who deliver the goods. <br /> <br />The funny thing is that this novel is not bad. Sure it has cooties, but its fast-paced and exquisitely plotted. The law stuff, something that as a lawyer I demand realism at the least, is very well handled. Lisa Scottiline is an excellent writer, even if is a girl. <br /> <br />	2005-09-13

Thomas Bolden stumbles into the workings of the club in what may be the final days of the club or the republic. Bolden proves resourceful and he is aided by mysterious but determined allies. Time is of the essence as the club plots the assassination of the new President of the United States. <br /> <br />This book is eerily reminiscent of The Firm, but without the black humor of the control of a law firm being in the hands of the Mafia. If you believe there are no coincidences you will love this book. If you think that conspiracy theorists ought to be in the loony bin, you will still enjoy it.	2005-08-19

He moves temporarily to Slippery Rock NC (note to Jim Swain-It's Sliding Rock  that's outside Brevard) and uncovers a town awash in greed but precious little evidence. <br /> <br />Swain's book are usually filled with failed gambling scams but this work is a veritable reference book on how to beat the odds on cheating, at least till Tony gets on your case. It is a wonderful read although real cops and prosecutors would not have had the trouble Swain suggests in prosecuting the large group of conspirators.

Three years in retirement and Harry is itching to carry the gold shield. Kiz Rider engineers his return where the first day on the job he is summoned to the new chief's office. There he gets back his old badge and an assignment to the Open-Unsolved unit which is LAPD-speak for the Cold Case Squad.    It is an interesting day for Bosch who is told he is on a short leash, has a run-in with his old nemesis Deputy Chief Irving Irving, and gets assigned a cold case where a DNA data bank has scored a hit, seventeen years after the death of a seventeen year old girl.    Bosch is a skeptic and an assignment to review a failed investigation is a perfect place for a natural critic. Bosch is prone to see investigative failures as institutional flaws which must be exposed to protect the integrity of the detective's personal search for the truth. This fearlessness usually brings him to the precipice of professional danger even while the relentless tracking of the killer exposes him to personal peril.    Bosch is not as dark and moody in this incarnation. But the crime leads down a treacherous path of time and race and class to a powerful and unexpected conclusion.	2005-06-09

Mark Frost attempts the Hildebrand formula with his biography of golf's first superstar the inestimable Bobby Jones. It is a great effort that falls only slightly short of its mark. Seabiscuit was surrounded by a great supporting cast, an eccentric trainer, a handicapped jockey, an owner who went from repairing bicycles to incredible wealth in the retail car business.    Jones' cast is dimmer, not because Frost fails to bring them to life, but because the golfers of that era were not quite as over the top as the horse people of a slightly later era. Jones would have been a legendary golfer without the assistance of O.B. Keeler, the sportswriter who made his name trumpeting Jones. But in reality how interesting is Keeler compared to Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's main jock? How much in a book about Jones do you want to read about Keeler's efforts to promote Jones?    Some of the social history seems to be a bit overwrought. World War I and its toll on young British and Scottish golfers has a definite place in understanding the rise of the American competitors. But how does a battle scene with French in retreat and U.S. Marines advancing relate in any way to golf?    In the end, it was a worthy effort that needed a stronger editorial hand to make it truly compelling. Unfortunately Frost never got it.	2005-04-10

Why do we believe theories that are not supported by data? Why is data misused?

She goes to Harry Bosch, now retired from the LAPD, to clear her from any suspicion. Harry quickly finds himself investigating another serial killer.    Yet this killer is none other than the Poet, the great FBI profiler Robert Backus. Bosch teams with Rachel Walling, Backus' protg to track down this good guy gone bad.    It is a chilling tale of serial crime, betrayal and the politics of murder. Only a writer with Connelly's imagination and power could kill off the hero of a short series and unite other protagonists in the chase for his killer. More amusingly, Buddy Lockridge and Graciela McCaleb bitterly object to their portrayal in Eastwood's film.

Here Swain explores the mysteries of fatherhood from cradle to adulthood within the context of another primer on casino crime and the War against Terror. <br /> <br />Jerry, Tony's son, has gone to Vegas to learn how to count cards at a shadowy school for cheats. Nick surmises that Tony's purpose was not only to help teach Jerry how to catch cheaters but to see how well he was able to resist the temptations of cheating. By all objective standards Jerry can't, falling in with a couple of Middle-Eastern card counters with more than larceny on their minds. <br /> <br />Tony arrives in Vegas to teach three casino operators about a new Palm Pocket-like device called a Deadlock that can dramatically change the odds in the bettor's favor. Once there he becomes wrapped up in a new love interest as well as failing fortunes of Nick, whose Acropolis casino is rapidly heading for the dustbin of history. When Jerry's companions attract the attention of the FBI, the usually fast paced Swain slips into hyper drive. Then the tale rockets along to a thrilling climax in the desert suburbs. <br /> <br />This series may well be the most important new arrival since Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch made their debut.

The first is a story of the Danny Padgett case and the young crusading newspaper editor who makes his smalltown weekly on the strength of his coverage of the trial.<br />It is also a tale of race relations in rural Mississippi as change finally comes to Clanton.<br />Unlike several of Grisham's latest legal tomes, the trial story rings with authenticity. I would have preferred greater development of the Padgett case, leaving the second story as an excellent subplot. Both stories would have been more meaningful.<br />But make no mistake, while this is not A Time To Kill (also set in Clanton) it is his best legal thriller in many years. It could have been more thrilling, thats all.	2004-03-03

The competition for private audiences with the lions of literature in the early 1960's (Frost, Rand, Hemmingway) is so intense, and the actual selections so misguided that we are left to wonder would the real Frost or Rand have made the same mistake. However, the ambiguity of the selection process serves to elevate the game while depressing the honor with which it should be played. <br />Significantly, Wolff proposes a new form of honor for morally ambiguous times, but this is a suggestion we would be well to avoid. The real test of honor lies in its ability to elevate standards and not lower them. Plagiarism cannot be the sincerest form of flattery as the victim of the narrator's perfidy tells him comfortingly.<br />To disagree with Wolff is to enjoy most richly what this book has to offer. In years to come new generations of students will debate Wolff's hypothesis late into the night. Out of it will come a deeper appreciation of what literature can bring to life, much as Salinger and Knowles have done for the past half century.	2004-03-02

This book is something you might have gotten to read if Tom Clancy had been a liberal.<br />A mole assassin is left stranded in deep cover by the end of the Cold War. He goes into business for himself and is ultimately hired by the military-industrial complex to shoot down a passenger jet and blame it on the Palestinians. The real object of the exercise is to get America to deploy a missile defense system and re-elect a right wing President.<br />A resourceful CIA analyst is thrown into the fray and disrupts the bad guys' plans after a lot of good people (including his own wife) have been killed, wounded or otherwise put in harm's way.<BR>If this sounds familiar, it should. It is a variation of the plot of Clancy's Patriot Games, brought out of Ireland and set on the post 9/11 international stage.<br />Silva did much better with The English Assassin.

Chloe once tried to buy an actual cheerleader's outfit to help Mr. Paradise get his rocks off. Chloe's efforts at customer service were totally rebuffed by the girls who wear the blue and maize to cheer on the champions of the West and not for the purpose of titillating elderly athletic supporters. But even if you can't buy one, you can have one made which is why Chloe was wearing her pleated skirt sans panties in death.<br />Dutch Leonard takes us on another wild ride through the world of dumb ex-cons, high class hookers, wannabe C.I.s, smarmy defense lawyers, and horny homicide cops to get to the bottom of the perfect crime that wasn't.

His life and death are not quite as unremarkable as he surmised. Eddie, who fixed rides at an aging amusement park, sees his life as wasted opportunity. Eddie, who loved and lost, and grew bitter with age, has to learn about life from the eyes of others. <br />This is a profoundly wise and sweet fable. The message is at least as old as John Donne who proclaimed that \\"any man's death diminishes me, for I am involved in mankind.\\" But unlike Donne's Meditation XVII  Albom's short novel flickers in lifelike motion like a silent movie across a silver screen.

When the sound of the crash fails to bring forth the house's occupants, the policemen leave a note. Much later on their return they find all as they have left it, and Montalbano is worried. He had good reason for worry for in the house is the naked body of a beautiful young woman, kneeling by the bed, her face pushed into the bed linens until she dies of suffocation.<br />At one point Montalbano wonders when did &quot;detective&quot; novels become &quot;mystery&quot; novels. It is a fair question since Montalbano is the archetypal detective, slowly peeling each layer of the onion until the mystery is revealed and then solved. He is an honest cop in a dishonest jurisdiction, but is not above a little self-help. Like cops everywhere he is vulnerable to bureaucratic ambition which has the effect of hindering his work.<br />Yet in the end, Montalbano prevails. It is altogether right that he should. And this is a book to be treasured for its ingenious plot and dry humor. Move over Lieutenant Columbo and meet one of your paisans Inspector Montalbano.	2003-12-02

Here is Part III and it bears more resemblance to Friday the Thirteenth Part III, than to the decent complex plausible work Cornwell gave us early in her career.<br />Cornwell has created some good characters. In this book, while many of them are back, their connection to the plot is questionable. It is as if someone has a list of characters and is seeking to work them into some sort of plot. One has to wonder if this is Cornwell's work or that of a ghostwriter. There is no love for or attention paid to any of them.<br />Here we have Lucy, Pete, Rocco, the werewolf, Benton, Jaime, Jay, Bev, and wait...Benton? He's dead! Well no, he is resurrected for some unknown reason in this tale of unfinished business. To make it worse the werewolf has escaped from Texas's death row (yeah right) and may have freed a necrophile and cannibal named the Beast who was in transit to get the needle. They just disappear, undoubtedly to return in an even worse sequel.<br />By the way,  Cornwell describes a corrupt member of organized crime who is the United States Attorney in Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorneys can be jerks, they can be political, and they can be boorish. What they cannot be is members of the Mafia or its French equivalent. Fortunately, this particular character is the most poorly developed character in the book.<br />Let's give this series a rest before Rocco, Jay, and Bev return from the dead. One resurrection is enough.	2003-11-25

The Triangle Fire in 1911 represents several different points of origin. It is, for instance, the point of origin for the political careeers of Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner. It is a point of origin for the demise of Tammany Hall. It is a point of origin for the industrial safety movements. <br />If the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company had not started another would have somewhere else. The Garment District was a tinderbox waiting for a match. The drama and breathless reporting contributed to the positive reform this disaster engendered.<br />Dave Van Drehle is an excellent reporter, and this book has a journalistic feel to it. Where it comes up short is that in its ambition it ends up giving too short a shrift to the fire itself. Its focus on the Triangle Company's labor strife and the society suffragettes seems oddly attached to the story of the conflageration. The portrayal of Max Struer who defended the factory owners in their criminal trial was masterful.	2003-10-08

Mike takes on the case and it takes them on too. They are challenged by the press, the police, and circumstance to prove their client's innocence. This is a Herculean task, and one for which they will not be paid.<br />As entertainment, Final Justice delivers. As reality, it has only a few moments where suspension of belief is required.

Now comes Steve Hodel, a retired LAPD Homicide cop who stumbles into the biggest case of his already distinguished professional career, and manages to close one of Hollywood's most lurid crimes.<br />The Black Dahlia was a young woman killed by person or persons unknown in 1947. Her body was cleanly dissected, without any damage to her internal organs.<br />Hodel's father was at the time a local physician who within several years would move to the Far East and make a reputation as a psychiatrist and later as a market researcher. Upon his return to the United States in 1991, father and son established a certain rapport.<br />Steve Hodel stayed in California and joined the LAPD where he rose through the ranks to become a homicide detective, retiring after twenty three years to work the other side as a private investigator.<br />Upon his father's death in 1999, his stepmother shows him a photo album which contains two striking photographs of a young woman. Wracking his brain he realizes it is the picture of one of his old departments most famous unsolved crimes-the Black Dahlia.<br />Carefully, the old homicide hand builds a case against his father, implicating him in other crimes as well. In fact, Hodel concludes his father was a serial killer, operating in an age before that term was widely understood.<br />But this book is more than a son's strange journey into the heart of darkness. It is also a time capsule rich with the artifacts of another era, a superbly written work that richly deserves a place at the head of the table of true crime works.	2003-04-24

Bosch remains haunted by one that got away, a cold case brought out for six month review, then quickly sent back to the file drawer.<br />Bosch, tied to the young female victim whose hands were raised as if in prayer at the murder scene, is drawn quickly into a web of relationships between cops, victims, civilians, money and crime that wraps around the Los Angeles scene.<br />With Connelly you know the mood will be dark and the emotions conflicting as Bosch ponders life, liberty, and the pursuit of justice. Even the events of 9/11 figure into this morality drama as Bosch tangles with the new rules of homeland security and intimates that an impending loss far greater than buildings or citizens is at stake, the loss of liberty herself.<br />I could not put this book down. My biggest disappointment is that I must wait a long time for another.	2003-04-09

With the close of the Cold War and the retirement of George Smiley I despaired of ever seeing the likes of him again.     Well I have, and his name is Gabriel Allon, who balances the thin line of duty and identity with the same tortured grace of Smiley himself. Allon is both the Angel of Death for the enemies of the state of Israel and an angel of light whose skill as in art restoration brings back to life formerly magnificent paintings.    Even more deliciously, Allon is pursued by The English Assassin, a man given to the dark side but so close to Allon in training, skill and, perhaps outlook as to be his alter ego. The game of cat and mouse and spy chaser and spy catcher twists and turns across the European continent, through the vaults of Swiss bankers and in the shadowy worlds of dealers in art looted from Jews by the Nazis.    This is a book worth savoring.	2003-04-04

The political question of the appropriateness of the death penalty is intertwined in this complexly plotted but ultimately unsatisfying work. Without revealing too much, I will say that there are only two possible outcomes in any \\"innocent man on Death Row\\" work. The choice an author makes usually relates less to the appropriateness for the work itself than to the views of the author on what is ultimately a political question.<br />Here other plot choices clearly could have been made. The problem is that the factual innocence of most of the newly freed from Death Row have come from DNA testing, and not lawyer theatrics. Parker commits to a lawyer-centric plot for obvious reasons, and it is in this mode the work and its ingenious plot slips a bit.<br />Entertaining to the end, its at the end that you yearn for what could have been.	2003-03-09

Inevitably Churchill is personally involved and some unlikely hero, in this case a young Danish student, saves England from Hitler. Jack Higgins has written many of them and now Ken Follett abandons the truly imaginative for the commercial.<br />Nonetheless it is a satisfying if fluffy tale. The Danes existed in a state of national disgrace over their capitulation to the Nazis. The payoff for them was the continuation of their national institutions and less severe occupation than that of Norway which fought desperately against the Germans.<br />Denmark's Finlandization did not sit well with everyone and a Resistance movement took slow form. Follett tells the story of this movement but in a very contrived manner. Germany has developed a superior radar to that of the Allies and it is reeking havoc on British night bomber squadrons. A young student must get the installation photographed and the pictures back to London before England itself is forced to surrender.<br />There are good cops, bad cops and lots of exciting spy craft, but in the end Jack Higgins could have written it. More is expected of Ken Follett.	2003-01-27

Swarms of microscopic molecular computers which are programmed to mimic predators in the wild, rapidly evolve into shaft shifting artificial organisms which threaten the survival of their human creators.<br />Jack Forman, recently unemployed software engineer, finds life as a fulltime stay at home dad frustrating especially since his wife's career in nanotechnology is spectacularly successful. Unknown to Jack his program which mimics predator/prey behavior has been incorporated in his wife's product. <br />After something goes terribly wrong Jack is dispatched to reign in the mutating artificial creatures.

In Unholy Order William Heffernan presents an even more diabolic relationship between a secretive Catholic order and a Columbia drug cartel.<br />Heffernan's novel falls short only by failing to fully exploit the oppotunities the cultish criminal enterprise offers. As he draws near the end of his tale, the focus becomes concentrated on one member of Opus Dei, rather than the order itself. <br />While this enables him to wrap up his novel, the reader wants more. In a sense Grisham had the same problem and reached for the same quick solution in The Firm with the \\"mail fraud\\" prosecution. But this book is, if anything, more artfully presented than Grisham's classic, and such a facile solution is a bigger loss to the reader.	2002-09-09

Because of human error, her failure to arrive was not investigated leaving hundreds of survivors in shark-infested waters for four days until the chance sighting of crewmen in the water by an American aircraft.<br />It is a horrifying tale, made all the worse by the inexplicable decision to court-martial the Indy's captain Charles McVay. The book also recounts the many efforts to clear Admiral McVay's name, some of these efforts continue.<br />My complaint with this book is that it is poorly edited. The author declares Captain McVay's conviction made it impossible for him to ever become an admiral, yet publishes his obituary identifying him as Rear Admiral McVay. Addition research reveals that McVay was granted clemency and was subsequently promoted to flag rank. One of the Marine survivors Private Giles McCoy is reported to have become a chiropractor in Missouri, and that he earned a doctor of osteopathy degree in the next sentence. It is thus unclear whether McCoy was a chiropractor, osteopath, or both. Good editing should have resolved this inconsistency. <br />These errors are hardly fatal to an outstanding account of this incredible ordeal.	2002-06-14

It is those occupational hazards that lead us into the bureaucracy of fire pensions  and the horror of two fire related deaths of medical board members, That would be mystery enough for many authors, but Suzanne Chazin takes us down an even more horrifying road as a killer plans to level fifteen square blocks of New York. <br />Fire Marshal Georgia Skehann, still learning her trade, is drawn into the swirling vortex of revenge, greed, politics and fire.<br />Underestimated by some, betrayed by others, Marshal Skeehan perseveres as a woman in a world of strong men. Likewise, Suzanne Chazin is hitting her stride and making her mark with imaginative plots and great subject knowledge.	2002-05-30

I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong...until I read the May 14, 2002 Wall Street Journal. The book itself is an enjoyable piece of fluff, quite unlike the dark steamy thrillers of Michael Connelly, a true master.<br />My discomfort about Patterson and his \\"co-author\\" Andrew Gross seems to have been well-founded. As Gross told the WSJ, \\"I don't want to go into what I do, but we both add value.\\"  Added value is not a literary term; it is the language of business, of marketing, of advertising. And it should sound like it, since it turns out Patterson is the former CEO of J. Walter Thompson USA, one of the largest ad agencies in the world.<br />This book, and by implication the inchoate series of which it is a part, exist  to sell more books on the West Coast, according to the Journal. Other audience grabbers that do not add at lot of value to the plot is the continuation of \\"The Women's Murder Club.\\" This sounds like some Nancy Drew type grown ups playing detective, not the improbable convergence of female cop, prosecutor, reporter and coroner.<br />None if this seems to trouble Patterson, who expressly likens his books to cereal brands. As he told the Journal, \\"The key to a brand is trust...The trust is that I will deliver a very commercial book that you won't find disappointing.\\"<br />Well Jim, Andrew, whoever, I am disappointed. And I feel a bit used.	2002-05-14

The hero or heroine must suffer from some flaw which makes his or her ultimate triumph more human and less like the inevitable victory of &quot;truth, justice and the American Way&quot; to put it in superhero terms.<br />Meet rookie Fire Marshall Georgia Skeehan of the FDNY. No ladies rooms in the firehouses; no respect from the brass either. Improbably the Department is triumphant over the NYPD to assume control of a serial arson case that resulted in dozens of lost lives. More improbably, Skeehan the rookie is assigned to lead the team. <br />Skeehan doubts herself since she is so inexperienced and because she failed to rescue a buddy in a dangerous fire while a firefighter. Hence her tragic flaw is revealed, and once revealed will surely be used to torment her.<br />Well Georgia does succeed (you knew that already) and earns the respect of her fire brothers. It is not clear if this earned respect translates into bathroom construction at firehouses.<br />Suzanne Chazin is a talented writer. This protagonist has a lot of potential and a lot of original material to work from both in terms of the characteristics of fire but in the characters in the FDNY. Chazin has woven a complex story and a complex subject neatly and with considerable dexterity. <br />If there are some obvious formulas being applied in this work, it will soon pass. Chazin knows her stuff, has a great imagination, and the determination to leave her own mark on this genre.	2002-05-05

A tearful anthropologist describes a child's life of torture from the partially recovered skeleton of a young boy. Bosch never wavers in a determined quest for the killer. <br />Sometimes justice is as costly as injustice, and the chance discovery of the boy's remains set of a chain reaction of the death and human destruction. Bosch survives on will and discipline, never accepting the easy wrong when there remains a hard right yet to be revealed.<br />Michael Connelly is the living master of this genre. Bosch, moody and cynical, never falters. Connelly, literate and dark, exposes a kind of humanity that makes you want to join the anthropologist in tears.<br />This is as good as it gets.	2002-04-17

In The Summons UVA law professor Ray Atlee first finds the money, over three million dollars, stuffed in shoe boxes at his ancestoral home following the death of his father, a Mississippi judge. His father was a paragon of virtue and honor. So where did the money come from and how did it get there? This is the great mystery as we follow the money backwards to its source.<br />The money itself dominates the novel. Money is a commody, as everyone knows in South Florida, and disposing of large amounts of cash presents huge logistical problems. But there are other problems associated with it as well. Soon it appears that someone else wants the money, and that the professor's life in in danger.<br />The corrupting power of this money is incredible. Everyone who touches it becomes tainted and diminished. Mystery becomes wrapped in the greatest tragedy of all, the lessening of good people.	2002-02-15

But when the victims include her own young daughter, then the murderess may be assured of permanent infamy.<br />In 1958 Anjette Lyles went on trial for killing her nine-year-old daughter, as well as a couple of husbands and a mother-in-law using Terro ant killer, which as we learn is 94% arsenic. This happened in Macon Georgia, not far from the rural middle Georgia town I spent my summers as a child. Anjette ran a restaurant, a courthouse kind of place, where she fed the very judges, prosecutors and even some of the jurors who would later condemn her to Georgia's electric chair. Being taking to the big city as a boy always meant that her restaurant would be pointed out and the tale of her perfidy retold.<br />My complaint about this book is that it doesn't tell enough. Spared execution because she was supposedly too insane to be put to death, Anjette spent the remainder of her life at the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville. <br />The author failed to come to grips with the fact  that in 1972 capital punishment was effectively (though temporarily) outlawed when the United States Supreme Court decided Furman v. Georgia. And while Ms White makes a good case of psychiatric malingering, the fact remains that Anjette Lyles remained in Milledgeville even after she no longer faced execution in the event she was determined to be restored to sanity. Further the degree of insanity necessary to avoid the death penalty being imposed is quite high. Essentially a condemned must not be able to understand that he or she faced execution , the reasons for it, and the consequences of it. Anjette seemed to be qualified in every way for the ultimate punishment, even if she was an obvious sociopath.<br />This will not be the definitive book about Anjette Lyles, though it is a good start. The definitive book has yet to be written, but when it is, Anjette Lyles will be assured of her proper place among the serial killers of the twentieth century.	2001-11-28

Stern and his team from Arnold and Porter took on the near impossible case, armed only with the real tools of our trade, the words and ideas that form the arguments that shape the law.<br />And yet this is not just the story of courageous plaintiffs' lawyers, it is about the truly great defense lawyers on the other side, in particular Zane Grey Staker, whose tenacity and command of the language and of his case, gave the A &amp; P lawyers a great and fair fight, and of the United States District Judge, whose role was not only to provide each side with &quot;the cold neutrality of an impartial judge&quot; but who understood that proper case management plays a critical role in achieving substantial justice.	2001-10-31

The coal industry required access into the deep recesses of the English earth. as well as technical advise from, among other professionals, land surveyors. <br />William Smith, a rather common individual, poorly educated, but possessed of good surveying skills found himself in great demand by the coal producers. After countless trips down mine shafts Smith made a critical observation-the strata for the earth passed through on the passage down the shaft of any one mine was repeated in every mine as well regardless of location. <br />The practical implication was enormous, for by the examining the exposed and weathered surface of any English landform, one was able to predict with certainty the type of strata which lay immediately below. Further knowing what in that layer, enabled the prediction of the layer which lay directly below that, and so forth. Thus it could be reliably predicted the location of minable minerals below the earth on the basis of surface observations. <br />Had Smith stopped there he would have still had an important place in the history of the science of geology. However, he studied and classified each of the strata by characteristics, and gave names to them, thus creating a common scientific vocabulary for other scientists to use in confirming his observations. <br />Smith went even further creating a beautiful map of the geological structure of England and Wales, which elegantly encapsulated his work into a practical and useful tool. This is a superb book on the life and times of a most unlikely giant of science William Smith.	2001-08-25

Mike and Rosie, ex-spouses and law partners, are called upon to defend Skipper Gates, the San Francisco D.A. whose campaign for Attorney General is complicated by his arrest for capital murder of a male prostitute in his hotel room following a political meeting.<br />Gates is distressed to learn that he is going to be treated like an ordinary criminal, his explanation not believed by the police or even his subordinates. Mike faces problems at every step of the proceedings, but mounts the kind of defense reserved for either the delusional or truly innocent. <br />Once again we are treated to the talents of Nick the Dick, the octogenarian private eye/mystery writer, who manages to work all sides of the fence while spinning tales of sandlot baseball with Joe DiMaggio (&quot;He taught me how to hit and I taught him how to slide. He was better at sliding than I was at hitting&quot;). Nick is such a great character because every trial lawyer knows him intimately- he is the quintessence of every old time gumshoe that somehow managed to deliver exactly what you wanted (usually with the admonition \\"Don't ask\\").<br />Sheldon Siegel has done a great job! I am looking forward to his next book.	2001-08-13

This was quite a surprise since his late father-in-law, Governor Leroy Collins, was definitely not murdered unlike the fictive former governor of Florida Jim Sullivan. Jim Sullivan was drawn broadly from the political career of Governor Collins, the legal career of Paul Helliwell, who acquired the vast acreage needed for Walt Disney World, and the demise of Stanley Cohen, a contractor killed under circumstances the Sullivan death was designed to evoke. <br />Strange too is the fact that although I had a slight personal acquaintance with each of the persona that comprised Jim Sullivan, I do not know Stephen Cody, even though we apparently practice the same type of law in South Florida. Cody is however a talented author who deserves a real publisher. Despite the recognition of characters, this is a exciting story told in a credible manner.	2001-08-02

He vows to try the case himself, even though he had essentially zero trial experience. There are dozens of folks with a motive to murder the partner, and even more including the new DA with a motive to make a suicide into a capital case. Daley must sort it all out on a short time table.<br />At its best this is the story of lawyers and their retinues. Sheldon Siegel introduces us to a great cast of characters. Whoever could forget Dr. Kathy Chandler, the mail order pop psychologist, or Nick the Dick, the eighysomething private eye?

Not since John Grisham's early work A Time To Kill have I read a book that tells the tale from the standpoint of a real trial lawyer.<br />We meet Frank O'Connell, a criminal lawyer with a doubtful future, largely the result of his own pride and arrogance. Handling CJA (Criminal Justice Act) cases in the DC Superior Court, Frank manages to insult a young corporate litigator assigned to appear for the celebrity defendant of the year, the lovely Ashley Bronson, painter and self-admitted killer.<br />This chance meeting proves fateful as she appears in Frank's office to retain him. Only a trial lawyer would understand his response when she hands him a list of defense counsel and asks if he is as good as the people whose names are on the list. &quot;Yes&quot; he replies, never looking at the list. <br />We learn that the prosecutor is pro, two Yale degrees, and three prosecutions so important that the courtroom artists sketch of him in action hang in his office. Frank fails to flinch, despite his modest circumstance. It is only then we learn of his own sterling credentials, the Manhattan DA's office, thirtysomething murder trials (all convicted) and the head of the white-collar crime section before moving to Washington to join his father-in-law's bigtime practice, only to leave as his marriage crumbled.<br />What follows is the perspiration of trial practice, punctuated by sudden insights, and luck-both good and bad. Consumed by the desire to win, the need to win, Frank prepares himself for the battle. Like every good trial lawyer, he never gives up, he never commits to a strategy so completely he cannot revise or abandon it on a dime, he never loses faith in his ability to deliver a verdict in the courtroom (well almost never).<br />I enjoyed it greatly.	2001-05-18

Wiley grew up in Tennessee surrounded by veterans of the Confederate Army. Around the front porch he learned the history of the Civil War from the men who had fought it. <br />After acquiring a Ph.D. at Yale, Wiley taught at Ole Miss where as he later told a class of Civil War students at Emory, &quot;the only person I knew who was writing books was Bill Faulkner.&quot; Nonetheless Wiley undertook to write about the Civil War from the perspective of its true heroes, the common soldiers who endured the mud, marches, food, diseases, enemy, and officers.<br />Drawn from the letters and diaries of ordinary soldiers Wiley created an enduring work. Unlike most of the Civil War histories of its time, The Life of Johnny Reb refused to focus on the generals, or the battles, or the politicians or even the causes of the Civil War. <br />Rather, Wiley depicted the rock-hard life of lonely men. These farmers, masons and blacksmiths in gray were sometimes hungry, often cold, and always dusty. Capable of fiercely engaging in the most horrific fighting the world had ever seen, they remained loyal and devoted fathers, husbands and sons. For these men, this war was not about slavery for few of them were slave owners. Rather the war was about home and family and the land that their family plowed. <br />Can there be a scene more melancholy than that of Union and Confederate troops huddled around the night fires and singing songs and hymns out across battle lines to each other even as they prepared themselves and their weapons for the morrow and its carnage? While Civil War era soldiers were not always the best spellers or grammarians, they had no trouble depicting army life to those they left behind with candor, understatement, humor and occasional exasperation.<br />Bell Wiley rightfully deserves his place among the great historians of the Civil War. This, truly, is a book for the ages.	2001-03-23

Mary DiNunzio, rookie lawyer, smells a rat, and undertakes to prove his innocence. Likewise a black police detective follows the same trail, leading to career threatening confrontation with a egotistic prosecutor.<br />Newlin is a desirable prize-like Sherman the &quot;the great white defendant&quot; of Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities.

Too many factors are beyond the control of someone happening upon a scene, including the possibility of the arrival of the police during its contamination. <br />Here is a hint for lawyers who read this review first. If you see an attorney client relationship you truly can't comprehend (excluding the representation of Jack Newlin by a first year associate) you will be on the right track.<br />By his false confession, Newlin in fact triggers a slew of horrendous events and additional deaths.

The &quot;New World&quot; surpassed the old in military and industrial might. The instability of the pre-War years was replaced by a sense of an indivisible Americanism, a nationhood heretofore unknown.<br />Nowhere was the rise of industrial America more evident than at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. The grandiose world's fair staked America's claim on her true manifest destiny, the leader of the industrial democracies. It was here that the telephone and typewriter were introduced to  skeptical and astonished consumers.

His victory, forever establishing the right of the poor to counsel in felony cases in America, was one of the landmark cases of the Warren Court.<br />As importantly, this book illustrates law at the human level. This is where practioners routinely encounter it. Cases studied in law school are sterile, stripping the humanity and drama from the litigants, and replacing them with rules of decision and conduct necessary for societal regulation. The distillation of fact contained within an appellate decision, even a landmark, pales in comparison to the human beings who create the cause.<br />Anthony Lewis's book should point law students and young lawyers to the deeper lessons of practice.

This is an immensely satisfying tale of the aspects of Miami usually left out the Chamber of Commerce brochures.<br />Novelist, ex-cop, crime victim and soccer Mom, Hannah Keller finds her full life disrupted by an FBI sting which places her as the bait for Hal. This Hal is not a computer but rather sociopathic hit man who literally rips his victims' hearts out of their chests. Hal is assisted by Misty Fielding, daughter of a big time embezzler. Misty, a brilliant but obsessed ex-Hooters girl, finds in Hal a soul mate whose quest for job security neatly dove-tails with her own homicidal instincts.<br />Hannah's aggressive quest for justice leads her into harm's way, where armed with street smarts and a cast of Miami characters that would be unbelievable in any other town, she confronts and conquers pure evil.<br />While there may not be too many surprises, this is one of the best in the Miami mystery genre. Take it from a native Miamian, it could happen here.	2001-01-30

This book might be better titled Black Notice Part 2.<br />The plot is convoluted and contrived. Its actual resolution turns on the assumption that you can become an ATF agent, without undergoing a background check, and that Lucy wears body armor. <br />Other meaningless plot devices include a large breasted New York special prosecutor who has Kay recreate the Bray murder all the while she is engaged to bring Kay before a special grand jury. Kay's friend Anna, the psychiatrist is revealed to have not one but two secret pasts-her father hosted SS troops in their Austrian castle within site of a death camp, but her entire family were really Jewish!<br />Of course it all comes out well in the end, justice prevails and the bad guys are on the run - all the better for Black Notice Part III	2000-12-21

This comes  from the requirement that lawyers maintain a stern or inscrutable demeanor  when a witness splits his pants wide open leaving the witness stand.  However in lawyer bars across the land, alone with our own kind( don't ask  ), lawyers tell &quot;war stories,&quot; collected here by Ron  Liebman.<br />Parts of this book, my own contribution excepted, are truly  funny. Imagine the elder statesman of a major firm, addressing a gaggle of  Japanese businessmen (prospective clients no less) in Tokyo, by reminiscing  about the last time he had seen the city... from the air... as a World War  II bomber pilot...or join the young lawyer trying his first case watching  as a juror suddenly exits the jury box during his closing argument.  Theyoung man's mouth might still be agape had not his more senior colleague  rose to say &quot;Personally Judge I didn't think he was that  bad.&quot;<br />OK, so Jay Leno is in no trouble here, but if you are at all  curious about what we really talk about, Liebman let's you know.	2000-08-19

It may seem paradoxical to most that for trial lawyers are not afraid to lose a case. Every trial is a learning experience. You learn about your opponent; you learn about yourself. You try a losing case over and over in  your head at night. You learn from your mistakes. You learn from the  opposing lawyer. You become obsessed and through it all you learn how to  win.<br />This is the true story of some country lawyers in Mississippi who  launched a holy war against Big Tobacco. They were unlikely Davids battling  a Goliath. <br />The country lawyers looked like easy pickings to the big firm  lawyers from the big cities. The silk stocking crowd would bury them in  paper, bankrupt them in endless discovery, and outdazzle them in court, if  the bumpkins ever got that far. These champions of nicotine had never lost  a case. The clients had never paid one dime to any tobacco victim. They  were the chosen ones, selected to keep the streak alive, to bring home the  scalps of the piteous Mississippi lawyers. <br />Trial lawyers know that a  lawyer who has never lost a case has never tried a case. Undeterred by the  myth of invincibility of the tobacco industry these dreamers were able to  use the industry's incredible arrogance on itself to bring it to its knees.  In short, the truth got out, and the rest is history.<br />If you are a law  student or a young lawyer thinking about trying cases for a living, read  this book. This is how its done and how you can sleep at night.	2000-07-27

He let me try the case, and we received  a rather just decision from the court. I was quite proud of myself, only to  learn from my boss that the senior partner felt that my style of cross  examination was ineffective at best.<br />I determined to learn all I could  about effective cross examination. The first book I read was also the last-  Wellman's The Art of Cross Examination. Although the book was writen around  the turn of the century, it contains a treasure trove of illustraions about  different kinds of cross examination. How to Cross Examine the Hostile  Witness, the Lying Witness , the scientific Witness, the Truthful Witness  (the hardest job of all)<br />The book is a true today as it was 95 years ago.	1998-09-18
