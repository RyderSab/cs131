It is both a gripping piece of fiction, as well as a useful resource on survivalism.  I would not have thought it possible for a survival book to be so interesting, but this one really is.  The storyline itself is very interesting and holds your attention, but in addition to that the book is full of little pearls of wisdom about how and where to acquire things that make one better prepared.  When I was in the early stages of the book I was impressed by all of the references.  Later when I was most of the way through the book and still kept finding more and more nuggets of wisdom I was truly amazed.  The breadth of knowledge displayed by the author on a wide variety of subjects is truly amazing.  This book is very well researched, and best of all, it is also very interesting to read.  Several years ago this book might have been simply an interesting work of fiction, but now in the post-9/11 world it is something to think seriously about.  Also, the opening chapter which focused on the start of the economic crunch reminded me of the summer of 1997 when Asia and Russia's economic crises coupled with the near bankruptcy of a large US firm called Long Term Capital Management and almost sent the world into economic collapse.  Add to that some other recent events such as the bursting of the dot com bubble in 2000, the stagnation of the economy shortly after 9/11, and the high gas prices of 2004.  It just goes to show, the circumstances in this book are quite possible, more so than any of us would like to admit.	2004-06-01

My previous exposure to Dave Ramsey had been his radio show which I liked, but unfortunately the station that aired it in my area got sold and changed formats.  So when I saw this set of CDs I immediately purchased them.  It's probably the best money I ever spent.  Dave Ramsey's books are good but sometimes a book doesn't stay with you after you finish it.  Dave's radio show is great but you have to catch it when it is actually on.  These CDs however are the best of both worlds:  you get all of Dave's wonderful wisdom on personal finance available to you anytime you want to listen to it.  I cycle through these three CDs in my car and listen to them repeatedly.  CDs one and two are outstanding and will definitely get you angry about debt (that's what Dave is famous for), but the real magic probably exists on the third CD, the one about budgeting (aka &quot;cash flow planning&quot;).  This CD really changed things for me because it made me understand that money is a fluid, active thing which must be managed.  Once I understood that EVERY dollar of every paycheck had to be named (even if it was just to designate that you were going to blow a portion of it), I started really feeling like I had total control of my money.  <BR> In conclusion, I would highly recommend purchasing this set of CDs.  I wish I'd had them 15 years ago.	2003-12-19
US	53043606	R6VRS5MT7LS6C	1852334010	91885377	Inside Relational Databases	Books	5	14	14	N	Y	Understanding basic database concepts well	This book is excellent!  At the time I read this book I had been working with Access, Sybase, &amp; Oracle for 7 years.  However all of my database knowledge was product-oriented and I did not have a really firm grasp of general database concepts and principles: primary &amp; foreign keys, tables, joins, and other basic concepts were never explained thoroughly.  Sure you can read about these concepts in the documentation for whatever database product you're using, but everyone glosses over these important basic concepts and assumes that &quot;someone else covered it&quot;, when in fact no one has.  This book changes all that.  Although it is written for beginners, I suspect that even intermediate administrators and developers will get a lot out of this book; it's the kind of book where just when you think you already know the material, you come upon some nugget of information that clears up a concept you'd always had trouble understanding.  That's what makes this book valuable.  The fact that the author is british doesn't surprise me; I've noticed lately that when it comes to technical writing, English authors do an excellent job of covering the basics before going on to the more technical material, whereas American authors tend to focus more on writing books and articles that are product-specific.  Now that Mark Whitehorn has covered the basics in this book, I hope he will consider writing an Oracle book.	2003-12-12

There are several different novenas, prayers for different occasions, blessings, and brief stories.  As foster father to Our Lord, St. Joseph's intercessory power is probably second only to the Blessed Virgin Mary herself.  I have always loved this wonderful saint who is an excellent role model for husbands and fathers.  This wonderful pocket-sized prayer book is well worth buying.	2003-11-25

Rather than dealing primarily with the events which occurred at Garabandal, this book deals more with the after effects.  In that respect it is an interesting read.  Conchita actually moved to the US, married a New York man, and does her best to live an ordinary life; however she is the main visionary from Garabandal, and for that reason her life can never be completely normal.  I mean let's face it, how many Catholics can say that they have had Mother Teresa come to their home to visit, as well as various bishops and theologians from around the world?  How many Catholics can claim to have had a private audience with the Pope, as well as St Padre Pio?  Bottom line is that Conchita is who she is: a woman who has seen visions of heaven and actually knows the exact date when the greatest miracle in the world will soon happen.  When you've got that kind of knowledge and background, you will always have people seeking you out for advice and insight, no matter how hard you try to appear 'normal'.  Those in the know don't need to wait for Church approval (by the time it comes, it will be incidental since all of the predicted events will have already played out).  They know that the important thing is to live the faith and live the message of Garabandal as if each day is your last.  Time is short, and no one knows that better than Conchita.	2003-10-20

I think the reason is the incredible importance of the predicitions made there, many of which should come to pass very soon.  It is amazing that three of the four visionaries are now living in the U.S., with Conchita living quietly in the New York area where she patiently awaits the day when she will announce to the world the impending Warning and Miracle (which must happen soon).    This book starts off with a few chapters that give general information about the events of Garabandal, and then leads into the testimonials of the villagers.  Each villager has a chapter in which they respond to a similar set of questions about the events.  Apparently, the official commission which was established by the local bishop did not interview very many of the villagers, as strange as that seems, so this book is a very important piece of the historical record.     As I read the anecdotes presented by the villagers, I began to realize that these people were more blessed than they probably even realize.  Most of the people interviewed for the book saw ecstacies many many times (hundreds in some cases), and were surrounded by grace on a daily basis.  The testimonials of Jose \\"Pepe\\" Diez and Simon Gonzalez (Jacinta's father), are especially thorough and very informative to read.     In addition to this book, I would also recommend that people visit garabandal.us which is the official site of the New York Center, and Joey Lomangino.  A lot of good information is available there for free.	2003-10-09

St Philomena seems to be a saint who is particularly close to God, and you'll understand why once you read about the circumstances of her death and the the incredible success which people have had when asking for this saint's intercession.

The only problem was that it did not cover all the topics and what it did cover seemed more like a light overview.  So I ended up signing up for a Unix (Linux) class at a local college and Wells' book was the textbook.  It's an excellent book for beginners.  It assumes no prior knowledge of Linux/Unix and explains everything you need to know.  All topics are covered thoroughly.  If you are not lucky enough to have access to a Linux class that you can take at your local college, you could probably just read this book and learn a great deal by self-study.  By the way, we used this book to learn the general concepts, but also used &quot;Linux In A Nutshell&quot; by Ellen Sievers as our reference for all of the commands.  Both books together will definitely cover most everything you need to know in order to become Linux-literate.	2003-04-15

This book does a good job of explaining macrobiotic cooking, but it is worth mentioning that author Aveline Kushi died in 2001 from cervical cancer which had spread to her bones.  While I do believe that diet can help in the fight against cancer, macrobiotics is not and other forms of diet are not necessarily a cure all.  I am sure it is a very healthy diet that works for many people, but it may be difficult to stick with.  May Ms. Kushi rest in peace.	2003-04-09

I had to have it.  I use this book often since Linux's man pages can be somewhat cryptic to a new user like me.  The author does an excellent job of explaining the commands and options in plain english.  <BR> Obviously since this is a reference book (basically a Linux dictionary) you will not read it cover to cover.  Instead you will find yourself constantly referring back to it, looking up new things you haven't seen before or old things that you can't quite remember.  Having this book on your shelf is sort of like having a good Webster's dictionary, it's a must.	2003-03-26

I started reading this book after hearing about St Vincent Ferrer in another book (Trial, Tribulation, and Triumph) on apocalypticism.  St Vincent Ferrer is perhaps the most amazing saint of all time, but for some reason we don't hear much about him anymore.  He was well known for his preaching which attracted crowds so large (tens of thousands) that he often had to preach outdoors.  He also performed so many miracles (often 10 or more per day) that the Vatican gave up trying to document them all when his cause for sainthood was under investigation.  What's interesting is that St Vincent Ferrer travelled and preached during times much like our own, when people were turning away from God and the world was in danger of chastisement.  St Vincent's passionate preaching converted many sinners and saved the world once before.  Perhaps it is time today for us to start praying for this saint to intercede for us.	2003-01-24

Tobias' main point is that you need to start saving 10% of your income, and he also gives advice on ways to cut costs and where you can put your money.  I've read a lot of investing books and some of what he said was not new to me.  However, I did learn some new things.  Some parts of the book that I found helpful were Chapter 5 which explains Treasuries (bills, notes, and bonds).  I also liked his advice in Chapter 10 about what to do if you fall into a large sum of money (Lottery or inheritance).  There are also some useful resources in the appendices in the back of the book such as contact info for discount brokers, mutual funds, a compound interest chart, and finally a quick summary of his main point (save 10% of your income).  I gave the book four stars instead of five because I don't agree with ALL of his advice, for example I do not believe in purchasing rental properties (too big of a headache), and I think that home equity loans are a BAD idea.  Other than that, a great book.	2002-09-11

Later, I needed to learn Java since I had to manage a software upgrade project that was going to involve Java.  I wanted to be competent enough to be able to look at the code and know what the heck was going on.  This book is aimed at people like me who are real beginners and like to have the code broken down and explained line by line.  The author does a very good job of explaining the concepts in a way that beginners can understand (that's rare, and is the reason why I gave it five stars).  <BR>  Having said all of that, this book is a little out of date, but I'd still recommend it as a good first book that can be supplemented later with newer references to fill in the gaps.  <BR>  The author published another book in this same series (&quot;No Experience Req'd&quot;) on C++ that is also very good, with a similar title.  I'd recommend that one as well if you need to learn C++.	2002-09-11

The book is good, but one thing about it is that it presupposes a good knowledge of english grammar.  If you don't know a participle from a preposition, you will be confused.  Why?  The chapters are very brief and to the point.  No fluff or narrative to explain grammar, just a straightforward explanation for the grammar-literate about the rules of how latin works.  The best way to use this book in my opinion is to find the Wheelock Latin notes written by Dale Grote (they are posted on the internet), and use those.  If you read his notes for each chapter first, then you'll be able to understand the Wheelock book easily.  In fact, if you read Grote's notes first, then the Wheelock chapter second, then do the exercises in the back of the book (and possibly also the workbook if your class uses it) third, you'll do fine.	2002-06-06

It's a good  book, and one I would highly recommend for anyone who is new to setting up a network at home (or in a small office).  Parts I found especially useful were Chapter 12 \\"Sharing an Internet Connection\\".  The book has a good description of routers.  It also does a good job of describing how your ISP provides you with an IP address for your main machine, and then how you can give your other machines private IP addresses (Ch. 7) and then use NAT which will change all the private IP addy's to the single address your ISP gave you, so those machines can go out on the net.     I also like the fact that there is some discussion of including Linux machines on your network.  This book will get you started on SAMBA so you can share stuff between MicroSoft and Linux (Ch. 9).	2002-02-01

This wonderful little booklet can be read very quickly, within an hour.  However, it is packed with useful information that will get you fired up about the effectiveness of praying the rosary.  The author starts off talking about various Marian apparitions.  He then moves on and refutes some of the objections people might have to the rosary (my mind wanders, it's repetitive, etc); Fr Shamon shows that the only bad rosary is the one not prayed.  He then goes on to discuss various testimonials about how the rosary has helped people who were devoted to it, and wraps up with some major world events that were connected with the rosary.  To me, the most fascinating anecdote in this book was the story of the Jesuit priests who lived eight blocks from Hiroshima's ground zero.  Their devotion to Our Lord and Our Lady through the rosary left them and their house totally unharmed, while their surroundings were laid waste.  What more proof do we need???	2001-11-13

This book is absorbing reading. The first part of the book has some general horror fiction, but then the stories in the second half of the book are part of Lovecraft's works known as the &quot;Cthulu Mythos&quot;. Very very scary stuff. Not scary in a shocking way, but rather in a creepy, get-under-your-skin, eerie kind of way. This may have something to do with the fact that many of the demons and entities in his book were borrowed from mythology and occult sources. Creepy scary stuff. I couldn't put it down.

This was a saint I could relate to! An ordinary working-class man who substituted his daily struggles with devotion and study. But when I started to read this book, I grew a bit dissapointed. Matt Talbot was Catholic, and the author of this book is Catholic, but the book seems to be written from a more generic Christian perspective (minimize discussion of Mary, etc), possibly in an attempt to be more \\"ecumenical\\".

Interesting characters, good story, fascinating subject matter (apocalypticism) all combined to make a great book.  I had recently read 'Pierced by a Sword' by McFarlane (another hot Catholic fiction title), but actually liked this book a little bit more.

The passage that really hit me was the part where it said that if you're not paying yourself first by saving a portion of your salary, then you're really just a slave;  you should really just ask your boss for room and board in exchange for the work you do!  The truth of this statement hit me like a ton of bricks, and inspired me like never before to start saving my money.  This book provides the instruction that all of us should have received while growing up.  I can't count how many times I heard during my life that I should save money and invest, but I didn't really get any good explanation about the practice of saving until I read this book!  I wish I had discovered this book ten years ago.	2001-06-22

It is hard for me to describe just how huge an impact this book had on my life when I was growing up.  I first read this book in middle school and then re-read it many times going into my high school years.  Any young adult can relate to this book, especially the way it vividly portrays what it feels like to be an &quot;outsider&quot; who's not part of the &quot;popular&quot; crowd;  and the surprising flip side, that the people in the popular group may be just as lonely (and subject to the same pressures) as the outsiders.  Any teen should relate strongly to this story.  If asked to name my favorite book of all time, this would probably be it;  it meant so much to me growing up.  Thank you S.E. Hinton, from the bottom of my heart.	2001-06-15

This book was written long ago, and thus was aimed at the traditional latin Mass, but it is also just as appropriate for the current Mass.  This book is a little long, but is a great read!  It dramatically improved my whole understanding of the Mass, what it means, and what is actually happening during Mass.  This book will make you want to attend Mass on a daily basis, not just on Sundays.  This may be the most important book that a Catholic could read, because of its ability to make attending Mass a pleasure instead of a &quot;Sunday obligation&quot;.  Scott Hahn's &quot;The Lambs Supper&quot; is another good book (and is a quicker read than this one), but &quot;The Incredible Catholic Mass&quot; is my favorite.  Buy it, read it, and then re-read it periodically.	2001-05-30

This is a really good book, and is one that you can read in a single night.  I liked the author's honesty about how the market humbled him before he finally &quot;made it&quot;.  I liked Darvas' technique for boxing stocks and I have been using this technique ever since, but my only complaint is that he didn't go into much detail about how he selected his winning stocks.  I wish he had written a chapter on his &quot;screening process&quot;.  If he had, I would've given this book five stars instead of four.  It's definitely worth reading though.	2001-05-30

It's hard to know where the 'fiction' ends and reality begins, but this book is incredibly interesting and I'd recommend it.  The little details about life in Rome and the way things work in the Vatican are fascinating.  To continue a previous reviewer's work, I'll post a comparison of a few more real-life counterparts that relate to Martin's 'fictional' characters:  <br />Fictional name = Real name: <br />Cardinal Rollinger = Cardinal Ratzinger<br />Archbishop LaSuisse = Abp. Lefebvre <br />Msgr. Sugnini = Msgr. Bugnini <br />Cardinal Levesque = Cardinal Lercaro	2001-05-15

It should be subtitled &quot;The TRUTH about the French Revolution&quot;.  Full of facts and dates, and heavily footnoted so that sources can be referenced, the author paints an indisputable picture of what the French Revolution really was:  a chaotic bloodbath in which the Catholic Church and anyone associated with it was brutally persecuted.  Carroll totally discounts the modern myth of the French Revolution as an event that simply brought France from monarchy to democracy, by inundating the reader with facts to the contrary;  did you know that one of the first people to die in the guillotine was a newspaper reporter?  So much for freedom of the press.  My only complaint about this book is that it is so full of facts and dates it made it slow to read because I found myself wanting to take notes!  This book is truly a powerful weapon for combatting the myths about the French Revolution.  The description of the &quot;field of screams&quot; was chilling.  Also disturbing was the scene where the animals pulling the death cart refused to enter the square where the guillotine was, because their senses were so repulsed by the blood-soaked ground.	2001-05-07

He used this set of books once to explain anatomy to me so that I could understand a medical condition we were discussing.  The drawings are incredible, Netter must have been a true genius with a passion for his work.  What an excellent resource!	2000-11-27

Since it's written as a fictional novel, it's very entertaining to read.  But it's also informative, and a very powerful book.  I especially liked the fact that the author seems to be a very orthodox Catholic, and isn't afraid to show the damage done by so-called &quot;cafateria catholics&quot; who are ruining the Church.  This book also does a good job of illustrating the power of prayer and how your prayers really do make a difference in the spiritual warfare that is constantly taking place unseen by us throughout the world.	2000-10-02

This book is out of print but I was able to buy it through Amazon's auction site.  I highly recommend it if you are able to find it.  &quot;The Cardinal&quot; is a very entertaining book to read, and I learned a lot  about the way that the church and its dioceses are structured and the  hierarchy of the various types of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, etc.   The parts detailing the election of a pope and the internal workings of the  Vatican were fascinating.  Also, I found the moral dilemnas that the main  character Steven Fermoyle finds himself in to be interesting and  informative.  I consider myself to be fairly informed about my faith, but I  still learned a lot from this book.  Plus, the fact that it's a novel makes  it a fun book to read.     By the way, &quot;The Cardinal&quot; was made  into a movie and is out on video.  It's good, but the book has a lot of  stuff that the movie leaves out.  Read the book even if you've already seen  the movie.	2000-07-18

This book is EXCELLENT!  I was using Baumeister's &quot;New Missal Latin&quot;, but found it to be rather dry (good for ecclesiastical latin vocabulary though).  On the other hand, this book is very easy to read and  I have made more progress on my latin in the last few days than I had made  in the previous months of studying with other books!  This book is very  well laid out.  The rules of sentence structure are given up front, the  conjugations are taught in a common sense manner, and the reading exercises  are great!  Before you know it you'll be reading latin!  I would have  gladly given this book a higher rating, but five stars is the max you can  give!   I can't recommend this book highly enough!	2000-06-27

Fr Gamber gives a fair and balanced look at the changes in the mass.  He makes some very good points that really get you thinking.  He gives an especially strong and convincing defense of  saying the mass &quot;ad orientem&quot;, facing the altar (and tabernacle,  if it's up front like it's SUPPOSED to be) rather than the people.	2000-02-17

It is easy to read, and explains some difficult topics of Catholicism in an easy to understand style.  Even if you only plan to read one or two books on  your faith, I think this should definitely be one of them.	2000-01-11
