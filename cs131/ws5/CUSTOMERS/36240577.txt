Well, the book itself does the talking! The approach of the authors is quite different from other authors, in the sense that this book follows are more unified approach to the subject.<br />The section of Z-transforms and difference equations is treated especially well.<br />Can be used as reference and/or textbook.	2002-12-31

He has written the kind of optimal text on the subject.<br />Never does the momentum drop and that's what makes this text so exciting. Moreover, this book answers doubts as they arise. That is to say, you may get a certain doubt on reading something, just to find that the author answers it in the next line or paragraph. That sort of anticipation makes Mr. Griffiths a king.<br />Great text, suitable for relaxed self-study.	2002-12-31

That book made me say, &quot;Show me a better textbook if you can.&quot;<br />Not this one. This book, after giving you a brief introduction to electric and magnetic fields, goes to the applications of electromagnetics - transmission lines, waveguides etc. If these things interest you, choose this edition.<br />Otherwise, I recommend the 4th edition because it is simply the BIBLE of Electromagnetics.	2002-12-31

One can rather call it a great book on network analysis. This course is purely based on mathematics, and so it requires a strong foundation in differential equations, calculus and matrix algebra.<br /> The author develops the concepts and presents them in a manner that can only be described as thorough and comprehensible. The author places emphasis on the use of computers in problem solving. The book I own has computer programs in FORTRAN, which I do not know. However I used the same principles to develop programs in C, which worked perfectly fine.<br /> A good, useful text - extremely well-written.	2002-12-31

And the book I chose was this (in addition to John Kraus).<br />You must love William Hayt. He is one of the liveliest authors in electrical engineering. The way the text is presented, the examples, the problems solved and the like will remove the \\"ELECTROMAGNETICS IS TOUGH...\\" myth completely.<br />This may not be the best book around (for the purists), but it is certainly the most accessible!	2002-12-31

The author had presented the concepts of Fourier series and transforms before progressing to Laplace transforms.

Right from the basics of signals to the presentation of complex topics like communication systems, this book beats every other book. The one drawback is that examples are few and far apart.

This has been written for those already proficient (or conversant) in the language. And for such readers, this is a treat.<br />Unlike many other texts, this is a hands-on book. It requires a good deal of commitment from the reader, because it's not written in a way as to make you laugh every third line - believe me, it's a serious book.<br />As for the content, you'll find that it is presented in a clear-cut and straightforward format that you'll love to read.<br />My C++ shelf would be incomplete without this one.

Deitel's book on OPerating Systems. I have little doubts in recommending this book to anyone starting C++.<br />So much to say about this book, however I'll limit myself to a few points which I found salient:<br />This book does not keep referring to C, so you won't get bugged down. (In case you want to learn C, try 'C How to Program' by the same authors.)<br />This book has been written keeping the beginner in mind (beginner = someone new to programming). So, it contains good, solid, perfect, working code you can try out.<br />Each page is littered with observations on Good Programming Practices and Software Engineering. That helps in refinement of code, so you need not buy another book to find out how to code 'effectively'.<br />The exercise questions are elaborate and will keep the reader busy for hours on end. But all that's time that's spent usefully.<br />And this book does not leave out those who already know C++. It's as good as any book for an intermediate level programmer.<br />An excellent book. Buy this one, it's certain that this will be the last C++ book you'll need.	2002-09-18

You will not find a smaller but more powerful book on strategy.<br />Mike Davidson is perhaps the best in the line. The book is just about 100 pages long, and can be read in an hour. Based on a few pivotal principles which one can summarize even here (which I won't do and incur Davidson's wrath), the book is presented in the form of a series of meetings that a helpless and desperate new CEO has with a person called THE GRAND STRATEGIST, and how by following those principles he is told to follow, he himself ends up being a grand strategist.<br />Split into four 'major' sections, MISSION, COMPETITION, PERFORMANCE and CHANGE, this book is a must-read for any leader, or anyone who aspires to be one.<br />A most wonderful book.	2002-09-14

Well, I'm somewhere in the middle!<br /> This book is fine, but has a few drawbacks. Firstly, the print was too small that you needed microscopes to read it. Secondly, the authors seem to assume quite a number of things, so if you cannot get through the second chapter, you're a dead man. And finally, Millman has his own way of deriving new equations - he wants you to refer to a dozen equations from half-a-dozen chapters.<br /> Those being the downsides, now here are the positive ascpects. Firstly, the book is well-written - in fact once you get the basics right, you will find that you are getting at newer concepts ata tremendously fast pace. Secondly, the comprehensive nature of the book makes it a terrific companion for a one-semester course on the basics of electronics. And finally, the number of problems per chapter will knock the gas out of one and all. However a few more examples could have ameliorated the accessibilty of the text.<br /> Great book.	2002-09-07

I used it as a reference material (because I do not major in Chemistry) for a one-semester course.

I cannot deny the fact that this is a well-written book. But the authors had a way of getting on my nerves for the gradation between the examples and the exercise problems was too steep that if you did not grasp the underlying concept in the first place, you never ever will understand it. Most of my friends felt that way too.<br /> However that does not mean that the book is not good. At times you will be flabbergasted at how well the authors can push a difficult concept through. The section on 'Dynamics' was perhaps one of the best in contemporary entry-level texts on the subject.	2002-09-07

Of the many books I referred to, I found that Meriam's treatment of the subject quite different. It was bit rigid, and quite unlike Beer &amp; Johnston. I liked the book - the explanations were too good that you could not miss it.	2002-09-07
US	36240577	R23KMHZ922FU4Y	0140185453	286445627	A Tiger for Malgudi	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A different kind of classic	Is it true than only human beings can think? Do not animals have the ability to think? Well, never mind; but what if they did? Well, if animals did think, then you get a classic book, 'A Tiger for Malgudi' by name.<br /> I picked this book up because R.K. Narayan is my favorite author. And when I read the title, I thought the story was about how a man-eater or something enters Malgudi and terrifies the townsfolk and the like. But the blurb bemused me. Wait a minute, this book is different, I thought.<br /> And it really was. The entire story is narrated by a tiger. It recounts its younger days, how it gets caught and is made to perform in a circus, how it escapes only to be captivated by the magical powers of a saint who leads it into the forest. An entertaining philosophical discourse follows, and finally the saint entreats the tiger to enter the protection of a zoo.<br /> The entire novel can be completed in a couple of hours, but when one recounts the tale, one will break into fits of laughter. The humor and sarcasm are so very characteristic of Narayan. And there is no better scene in the story as the one when the tiger enters a local school. If anything, you'll discover India in that one scene.	2002-09-07
US	36240577	R3J75OGRRL3VRH	0226568288	37354159	Waiting for Mahatma	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Love transcends everything	Sriram, a 20-year old lad with lots of money, a loving grandmother and all the time in the world (to waste) meets Bharati, a beautiful woman. And as it always happens, falls in love instantly. But Bharati is involved in the Indian freedom struggle, and is a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the independence movement. She is a serious-minded woman and will think of nothing other than the task on hand. Sriram realises that the only way to win her hand is by immersing himself in the freedom movement.<br /> Thus he embarks on a life of struggles - he deserts his grandmother and all the money. At times, Sriram thinks if he should ever have altered the course of his life. Did he not enjoy life before? But love transcends everything. And for that one woman in his life, he will undergo any tribulation. He is waiting for her, but will she? The ending of the story is quite excellent, and will have you spellbound.<br /> Set in the 1940s, this book wonderfully narrates the freedom struggle through the eyes of Sriram and Bharati. To me, it is the most important work of R.K. Narayan and ranks alongside his classic debut novel, Swami and Friends.	2002-09-07

The structure of the novel - the use of multiple narrations was something that I liked. The way the characters were built and the plot woven was terrific.<br /> But I thought that the novel was a bit too big. The author could have conveyed the story much better had he chosen to cut it short. One thought the story was a good 15-20% long when compared to the main plot. But this was not the 'much ado about nothing' kind of book.<br /> However one will find it tough to forget the characters of Laura Fairlie as well as the wily Count Fosco. Ah! the Count, what an excellent character!<br /> I bet you'll enjoy this one!	2002-09-07

Narayan is the best Indian writer in English. Malgudi Days is a collection of short stories centered around the fabled town of Malgudi, which is the author's own creation.<br />Once when he was in New York, Narayan was asked where Malgudi was. To which the reply was &quot;Malgudi is everywhere. I find Malgudi right here in New York. The doorkeeper at one of the restaurants reminds me of persons I have come across elsewhere.&quot;<br />This book will make you live the Malgudi experience that has captivated so many readers. Enchanting, the short stories are too good that you will relaize that their greatness lies in their extraordinary simplicity. As someone said, the only thing that makes Narayan's books extraordinary is that they are extraordinarily ordinary! I bet you can relate to each of these characters. The stories are so close to real life that it will be tough not to experience a hangover.<br />Narayan is dead, but the legend of Malgudi will live on. Narayan is definitely one of the greatest authors English literature has ever seen. And nothing can quite match Malgudi...	2002-09-06

The real few who do so end up making it big, and 'The Alchemist' emphasizes that fact.<br />'The Alchemist' is a very important novel of our times, veritably a modern classic. The story is about a shepherd in Spain who dreams about hidden treasures in Egypt, and sets about seeking it. At times one might tend to think that this book is hinging too much on the occult, but a deeper analysis proves beyond doubt that one can relate to these things in one's own life... at least that was true with me.<br />The story is replete with advice for any person who follows dreams. But the most important aspect of this book is the author's contention that the true alchemist is the pure of heart. The novel sags not for a moment, and has as many twists that one can expect in life. And the ending was truly extraordinary.<br />Call it a fairy tale, call it a book steeped into magic and philosophy - end of the day, you cannot deny the fact that this book has affected you immensely, that it has set you thinking, evaluating about life, and the mysterious world of dreams, intuition and the will to follow dreams whatever the odds.<br />A modern classic like no other - short and sweet yet profoundly touching, this book is a marvel.	2002-09-06
US	36240577	R1S1ZRN7UVMWX8	0061092037	26202470	The Fourth Estate	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Excellent read	To those who have read Kane &amp; Abel, The Fourth Estate is a bit of deja vu. The plot is essentially the same. Two men - one a refugee from a war, the other an Ivy League-educated millionaire get pitted against each other and will not cease until the other man is driven out of business. The action is rivetting and makes the book a compelling page-turner.<br /> The book is actually based on real-life characters, and a few real incidents too. Readers will find it tough not to see the similarity between Keith Townsend and Rupert Murdoch.<br /> The way the story is woven is also reminiscent of Kane &amp; Abel, however the book does not sag one wee bit in action. I assign five stars to this book because that's the maximum!	2002-09-01
US	36240577	R3BP1QB3SXAAVQ	0345432401	684734174	Omerta	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Good one-time read	Mario Puzo wrote Omerta two years before he expired. Dubbed as the last in his series of Mafia novels, Omerta is quite an interesting read. The plot is simple - a New York Don gets killed, and his 'nephew' tries to pin down the killers. How he does it despite everyone's silence is the story. Since I have already said that it is makes a good reading, let's see the downsides of the book:<br /> There is too much use of sex and women in the novel that makes one wonder what the real crime we are investigating.<br /> And to describe every woman that we come across in the book as a true Mafioso was downright nauseating. I never thought men sat down to speak about a woman, only to describe her in every second sentence as a true Mafioso - you say that once, it's fine; but more of the same stuff is utterly obnoxious!<br /> But the more important factor about the book is this: people always tend to judge an author by his best work - his magnum opus. So every other novel is compared with his best work. And there can be no questioning the fact that The Godfather is Puzo's best work. I would say that when compared to Omerta, The Godfather was a work that cut very deep. It was definitely a more powerful novel. Omerta on the other hand seems a bit predictable.	2002-09-01

But if asked for another, then it must be this. Honor Among Thieves is a true international thriller. No doubt, it became an instant international bestseller.<br /> Saddam Hussain pays a hundred million dollars to a New York businessman to arrange for the stealing of the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives is Washington DC. At the same time, a Mossad team is set up to assassinate Saddam. How the Declaration gets stolen and how it is restored is the plot of the story.<br /> So much for the plot, but many authors would have found it tough to convert that into a good, readable book. Archer belongs to a class of his own, and one will find that the action in this book is gripping - so much that one will be compelled to finish this book in one sitting, which was the case with me!<br /> A truly great book!	2002-09-01

The Godfather is, in many ways, not just a novel - it is an experience, after which your life will never be the same again. I have not the least of doubts in calling it 'the best, most influential and deep-cutting that I have ever read.' In its sheer departure from being just a general, run-of-the-mill tale about idolizing a particular individual, the novel presents to us with a ringside view of the workings of the Mafia, and more importantly, the lives of the people who are involved in it, directly or indirectly.<br />The novel starts off with a quote from Balzac - \\"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime.\\" That, in effect, sets the tone for the entire novel. Mario Puzo, the author, ruthlessly captures the travails of a New York Don, Vito Corleone, who is, to quote the words of his son, \\"not a crazy gunning mobster\\", and his family.<br />Puzo presents to us an entire array of different characters - be it the short-tempered Sonny, or the dreary undertaker Bonasera, or the ever-faithful Luca, the cool-headed Tom, the 'Turk' Sollozzo, or the pleasant outsider Kay Adams, each character enters our world, refusing to leave. We are impressed by most of these essentially evil people because the story is told in an entirely closed world (of crime) and so we tend to love characters whom we would, in the normal course, detest.<br />The novel is, basically, about just two persons, Don Vito Corleone and his son, Michael, who after refusing to accept his father's ways, finally comes to terms with the reality and takes up the 'family business'.<br />Puzo shows us why he is the great author he really is! The character of the Don pervades our thoughts more than most (or almost all) other fictional characters do. Though the nature of his business is violent, the Don is portrayed as a genial, kind and reasonable man. To say the least, the Don is someone whom `every son will look for in his father, every woman will look for in her husband, and any mortal will look for in an inspirational leader.' In fact, the Godfather is what every man aspires to be - a strong, powerful and wise yet cunning genius and family man.<br />I have not read a better novel - chances are, you won't either! Do not miss the Godfather movies too.	2002-09-01

It is a quick and interesting read, but lets the reader wonder at the author's thought process. The novel is about how a clever businessman, Harvey Metcalfe, makes a million dollars by fooling four people, and how they come together and get back their money ... till the last penny.<br />Interesting though, one cannot believe that someone as brilliant as Metcalfe would fall for some cheap tricks played on him by the foursome. Huge sections of the novel become predictable, and for someone who has read Kane & Abel, it will not be tough to guess that the girl someone's doting with is the daughter of the man he wishes to beat.<br />However, the way the characters are built and the descriptions of events are wonderful - quite the way we've come to expect from Archer.<br />Overall, I would say '3 stars' ... cannot do much with the predictable storyline...	2002-08-24

It is an excellent tale detailing the lives of two men from exactly opposite stations of life and how each man builds a fortune, helps the other (without knowledge of the other) and finally tries to destroy each other.<br />A classic, it is an absorbing page-turner. If asked to use one word to describe the book, I would say 'UNPUTDOWNABLE'. And if asked to use two words for anyone who hasn't read this bestseller yet, I would day 'Read it!'	2002-05-28

Some of my friends told me that they found the initial part boring. Well, I didn't find that assessment to be true. This novel makes a very interesting reading, and like many other Archer novels, it picks up action as you reach 200-odd pages.<br />This is a tale of four aspiring gentlemen: Fraser, Gould, Kerslake and Seymour who enter the House of Commons in the 1960s, each aspiring to win the highest office - and to reach 10 Downing Street. But only one man can do it. Archer, the master storyteller that he is, narrates in detail the lives of each men - the ups and downs each must face - and winds it up with the final battle.<br />The suspense is gripping and the man who becomes the Prime Minister is revealed only in the very last paragraph of the novel.<br />Overall a great story... hats off.	2002-05-28
