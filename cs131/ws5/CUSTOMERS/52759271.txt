That all being said, this just isn't my favorite travel book about Vegas. The Dummies style works great for figuring out how your software works, but it doesn't seem to key in properly to what Las Vegas is all about.<br /><br />I think the main issue here is that the Dummies book tries to cover a number of different topics in a very shallow manner. Let's start at the beginning. It dedicates the first two chapters on how to get to Vegas. It lists things like \\"surf the web\\" to find cheap airline rates. I really didn't need a book to tell me that. It tells you to bring a cell phone. Really, if I get a book on Vegas, I want to know what to do and see in Vegas, and where to stay. The rest of this intro stuff is just fluff.<br /><br />OK, so we get to the actual \\"arrival\\" part of the book. Once again you have a ton of fluff about \\"look on the web to find hotel prices\\" and \\"avoiding hidden costs\\". They could almost have a cookie cutter travel book at this point, with no actual content about the city you are visiting. When we finally get to the actual hotel descriptions, there is a brief paragraph (or maybe 2) on each one. I would really have liked some sort of easy to use table listing them all and their features, rather than having to scan the paragraphs hoping they mentioned the items I was interested in.<br /><br />The restaurant area is the same way, a paragraph on each, no real organization to help you out on making your choices. But don't blink - quickly you are into \\"gambling tips and tricks\\". Really, if I wanted to learn how to gamble, there are ample books on the topic. I need to know the details in Vegas to choose where to stay and eat, and I still really haven't gotten enough of that information.<br /><br />You get some information on shows and nightclubs, but then you get lists of top 10 things that aren't in Vegas any more. This might be historically informative, and I might not have minded its inclusion if otherwise the book was chock-full of specific, useful information. But given how much of the rest of the book was already generic, it sort of rubbed that in my face. So now I know even more about things that aren't around any more :)<br /><br />I do love Dummies books. I own many of them and think they're great. For some reason, the Vegas Dummies book is the worst book in my Vegas collection. I guess it just goes to show that no one system can fit every need.s might be historically informative, and I might not have minded its inclusion if otherwise the book was chock-full of specific, useful information.

US	52759271	R2QDZ9ATOIK5OS	0764573683	39767851	Frommer's Las Vegas 2005 (Frommer's Complete Guides)	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Great hotel reviews	I own a number of travel books on Vegas, and Frommers falls squarely in the middle of the pack. It provides a lot of great information, but it's not quite as comprehensive as some of the other books I own.<br /><br />Once you get past the generic introductory fluff of \\"check the web for good prices\\", we start into the meat of the book. They have the hotels broken down into area of Vegas and then price range. While this might seem OK, I would have much preferred something that actually listed them by things I'd care to break hotels out by - do they have a pool? What restaurants do they have? Are they right on the strip? I do agree that the descriptions of the hotels here are much better than in other books about Vegas, but you still have to dig through that description to draw out what you are looking for and then make your own feature grid. Also, I just have to mention this, the author seems to LOVE making side comments (there seem to be a pair of parenthesis and side comments every third line). While it's cute once or twice it gets really annoying (especially when the side comments are completely meaningless - oh, did I mention that I should get to sleep soon?)<br /><br />Once you wade through all of the commentary, you do end up with a good sense of which hotels will appeal to you, to go investigate further. However, they could have done a much better job of organizing that up front for you.<br /><br />Next we move into restaurants which has the same bad/good balance - there are great reviews, but sometimes the tend to drift, and they just aren't organized very well. Then we promptly go into shows - only a few are mentioned - and then unlike the other books, we drift into some pretty strange categories. The book lists out coffeehouses, strip clubs, even wigs and getting married. It hits a number of topics. There's a small section on non-Vegas attractions too.<br /><br />Really, I find this a great \\"second book\\" because of the detail it goes into on the hotels. I find it fascinating that what they CHOSE to tout on the cover is \\"with insider gambling tips\\" when really this book has far less info on gambling than many other Vegas books I own. Certainly none of the tips shared seem very insider. Still, I suppose a book has to have a cover that entices people to pick it up. Maybe people wouldn't pick up a book that said \\"great thorough reviews of hotels in Vegas\\". But that is really where this book shines.ind it fascinating that what they CHOSE to tout on the cover is \\"with insider gambling tips\\" when really this book has far less info on gambling than many other Vegas books I own.

That's not to say that it's too big to bring with you! It's just that, at 472 pages, this provides by far the most information on the Las Vegas destination. It covers far more hotels, restaurants, golf courses, spas, etc. than any other book I have. <br /> <br />I love the charts in this book. One chart shows you every hotel in the area with the type of food, entertainment, pool, exercise room, etc. that they have. You can quickly scan and see which ones meet your needs. They've got reviews of the various nightclubs, describing what they are like in rather good detail. The reviews aren't about \\"everyone should go here!\\" They clearly lay out who would enjoy, and who would not enjoy, the particular atmosphere. <br /> <br />There are general restaurant reviews, plus a few \\"best of\\" if you're seeking a particular kind of food. The reviews of the shows are really good, and give you a great sense of what is good and not-so-good about each one. <br /> <br />If there's a downside with this book, it's that it focusses ONLY on Vegas - it doesn't go into the surrounding areas very much. But heck, the book is almost 500 pages long!! It does incredible justice to the city and really tells you everything you could want to know about enjoying your time there. If you want a book on other areas, go ahead and buy one. But if you want a book on Vegas itself, this is going to give you what you seek. <br />	2005-09-15

It has some great photographs in it, and the tabbed format makes it easy to skim through and find what you're looking for. Of course, because it's on the slim side, this does NOT have thorough information on all of the hotels, restaurants, attractions, etc. that can be found in Vegas. So keep that in mind. <br /> <br />This is great to carry with you as you wander around Vegas. It has the numbers of cab companies. It has the highlights of each casino so you can know what to look for. It has notes on restaurants, in case you don't have a particular one in mind and find yourself hungry. Most of the information is pretty generic - hours of operation, dress guidelines, quick descriptions. This isn't a massive tome. It's a pocket book. It gives you what you need to get where you're going. <br /> <br />While I have other Vegas books that are invaluable for actually choosing hotels and main restaurants, they are too big to actually carry with me on the strip. This book fills in that great niche, to have a reference guide with you as you go walking, to make decisions as you go.	2005-09-15

It's more like an origami instruction flyer. There are literally only 11 pages of instructions - plus 1 page of introduction, and 2 pages of tips at the end. <br /> <br />It's not that I mind a short book - but with it only holding 6 designs total, the price normally seen on this leaflet is rather high. Not only that, but Florence then came out with a second \\"book\\" with only 6 more designs in it, equally high priced. It would have been far more fair to provide (gasp) 12 designs in a book, and have it actually have enough pages to give it a slight thickness. <br /> <br />So, that all being said, exactly what do you get in Money Folding? You get some of the most basic shapes. You get a tree, a heart, a duck, a shirt, a butterfly and a ring. I agree that these six shapes are cool ones, and come in useful for card making and gift giving. However, the main issue is that all of these are classic designs, especially the ring and the duck. This means that you could go on Google and find all of these instructions for free. <br /> <br />The illustrations are reasonably good, done with drawn versions of US dollar bills so you can tell if you are folding the items properly. The instructions are reasonably clear. <br /> <br />If you really need one of these designs, and really want it in book form, then perhaps the cost of the book plus shipping will be worth it to you. However, I personally would go either with one of the larger origami money books where you get far more bang for the buck - or use the web and print out the information for free. I don't feel right paying someone so much money for so few designs.	2005-07-20

This book is no exception. This is a great book to get if you're interested in presents, tips or other uses for money origami. Even if you're a raw beginner, you can start with the very simple items, and work your way up to the complex.<br /><br />First, the collection of shapes. Things are rated by star difficulty. With the basic one star you get a boat, three diamonds, George Washington slept here bed, and a swan. For two stars you get a George Washington framed picture, star of David, windmill, house with chimney, sword, one-way arrow, tetrahedron cube, diamond, tulip, evergreen, tree with spiked branches, African mask, shirt with tie, crane, vulture, goose, flamingo, peacock, pelican, Asian dragon, alligator, tyrannosaurus, rabbit, armadillo, and squirrel.<br /><br />Move up to three stars and you get a petalled flower, eagle, aardvark, llama, bison, butterfly and dragonfly.<br /><br />That's the beauty of this book. You can make the classic shirt and swan designs for general tip-giving. If you've got a friend that is year of the dragon or year of the rabbit in Chinese astrology, those make perfect gift giving shapes. A house becomes a great housewarming present. The bed is a \\"thanks for letting me stay over\\" present. Insted of your gifts coming across as crass \\"take the cash please\\" sorts of things, you give it a touch of class by matching the shape to the occasion.<br /><br />I have a minor problem with the illustrations, as they are simply done with one side of the paper shown white and the other side shown grey. That makes it really hard to understand what's going on in some situations. If the illustrations actually showed a dollar bill design, you could match up where the parts fell to know you were folding properly. John also has this tendency to do tricky folds that involve squashes and folds that will tie your brain in knots. It can easily take you several tries to figure out his more tricky moves on advanced designs. Again, better illustrations would help with this.<br /><br />That all being said, you get an amazing collection of designs in this book, and your skills will definitely advance as you move your way through the designs. Well recommended!and folds that will tie your brain in knots. It can easily take you several tries to figure out his more tricky moves on advanced designs.

Both books only have 6 designs each - but have a relatively high price tag. With Money Folding 2 she doesn't even bother to number the pages since there are so few. There are 11 pages of instructions, plus a page of introduction and then 2 pages at the end for tips. That's it, that's the entire book. <br /> <br />The items you learn how to fold here are: a peacock, a necklace, a flower, a jumping frog, a crow puppet, and a pair of earrings. At least where the first book had super-common shapes that you could find anywhere on the web, these designs are a little more unique. The peacock is the most interesting to me, with its lovely fan tail. Unfortunately the only way you can keep that tail up is with double-sided tape or glue :). The necklace, a \\"lei\\", is more like making a series of circles with separate dollar bills and then stringing them on twine or yarn. <br /> <br />The frog does look vaguely frog-like - in essence you push it over and it rolls. The flower is really just a circle shape, stuck on a straw. The earrings are a simple twist fold, that you attach to earring posts. Finally, the crow puppet looks sort of like a beak, I grant you. But I like those four-part beaks you make out of paper much better - something I think every school child learns to make somewhere along the way. <br /> <br />I suppose I might say that if you really want the peacock, that it's worth the price of the book plus shipping to get the peacock design (as long as you have glue and / or tape around). But really what I would say is that there are several other books on the market that include the peacock AND include many other cool designs - and that the per-design cost is far lower on those.	2005-07-20

Learn about cruising from the ground up with this informative book. <br /> <br />I have a number of books about cruising, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Cruise Vacation is a great overview of what cruising is all about, with information given on the most commonly used ports and destinations. There's also a page or two on each main cruise line and what its strengths and weaknesses are. <br /> <br />The beginning of the book goes over the basics - passport and documentation, what to expect on a cruise ship, how you pay your bills, what duty-free is all about, and so on. The next section helps you compare the cruise lines, describing each main line and providing comparison charts of the typical rates for the ship and the fleet's specifications. They update the Dummies book each year, so make sure you get a current book to get valid rates. <br /> <br />The rest of the book - almost the second half of the book - is taken up with descriptions of the various port towns and destinations. If you're leaving from Tampa, for example, you can see maps of the area and learn about interesting things to do before you sail off. You can read through the descriptions of the various destinations and see which ones appeal to you, and start to prioritize your choices. <br /> <br />Where some other books are sure to point out the bad AND good of the locations and ships, Dummies seems much more oriented towards always talking up the good. This makes it less of a \\"consumer reports\\" and more of a \\"promotion of the cruise industry\\". Cruise descriptions include \\"outstanding features\\" and \\"super deals\\" - but not any listing of what to watch out for. The very few times they give warnings, they are of the quite obvious kind - i.e. Disney cruises are full of kids, and honeymooners seeking romance should be aware of this. <br /> <br />Still, the book gives a great overview, and is well recommended. <br />	2005-07-16

It has EVERYTHING you could ever want to know about cruising history. <br /> <br />First, to be clear, this is NOT a review of which cruise ships have pools and which have nice restaurants. Instead, this book talks about the history of cruising, and gives you background on the various cruise ships in operation. You learn really cool stories about how the cruise ship lines formed, and hear stories about individual ships and what has happened to them over the years. <br /> <br />The book is hard cover and HUGE. It's about 360 pages of dense information. I had a real blast reading it. There's a story about the Norwegian Majesty, about how it was running on GPS autopilot in 1995 heading back from Bermuda to Boston. The crew figured it was OK and didn't bother to look out the window at all. The next thing they knew, the ship was grounded on a shoal near Nantucket.  <br /> <br />The book has a giant appendix full of histories of all the ships. It is really fascinating to learn how frequently ships are traded from line to line, and just what they were originally built for. Some cruise ships began their lives as car ferries, and then were rearranged to handle passengers. <br /> <br />If there's any detraction, it's that the author seems a little fascinated with the type of funnel (smokestack) on the ships and the type of propulsion system :) But hey, we all have our little quirks. If that's what he enjoys, that's fine with me! I might have liked a little more detail about what the ships were like inside, but you can get that from plenty of other sources. As far as base history of the ships that we love, there really is no other book that comes anywhere close to this one. <br /> <br />Well recommended!	2005-06-27

That being said, it really does step you through all of the basic, common-sense things to keep in mind when you're planning a cruise. It talks about making sure you choose a cruise situation that is right for you - and not right for the travel agent's pocketbook. It discusses types of cruises, special needs, and how to choose a travel agent. <br /> <br />There are tips about what to do when you first get on board, how to make the most of your time at see, how to avoid any hidden charges. There are safety tips for both the cruise ship and shore excursions. <br /> <br />I don't know that this was really an \\"experts share their secrets\\" as touted on the cover of the book. There wasn't anything TOO secret in what I read! Again it was all pretty much common-sense information that you find on just about any cruise website. But it is all nicely gathered together for you, nice easy-to-read type, perfect for sitting back and thumbing through and preparing for your upcoming cruise. <br /> <br />Well recommended for the new cruiser! <br /> <br />	2005-06-23

It's full of short, quick to read tips on every aspect of cruising. <br /> <br />You're not going to get a long, drawn out planner here. This is really about quick hints to help make your cruise more enjoyable. Much of it is common sense - pack light. Have a happy attitude. Don't sweat the small things. Plan ahead. Use sunblock, carry antacid. <br /> <br />A lot of the wisdom, though, is common sense earned by Jim after thousands of days at seas. He recommends lower floors for their more steady ride. He suggests arriving in port a day ahead of schedule so you're more than ready for departure. When you are leaving the vessel, also don't try to rush. Have a leisurely breakfast and do a crossword puzzle while the ship's crew do all of the docking and final departure preparations. <br /> <br />For those who have never been on a cruise, a lot of the information is invaluable. Always bring a carry-on, because your main luggage might not get to your room until late in the evening on the first day. You always want to do the reverse on the way off the ship - the crew will take your luggage the night before. You need to have a carry-on with you to carry your PJs and toiletries off the ship with you. <br /> <br />The price is relatively reasonable for such a tiny book full of nuggets of wisdom. It's well worth buying a copy and passing it along to each member of your party before you leave. You never know who will find which pieces of information to be critical! <br />	2005-06-19

Klein, you are given the gritty underside of the cruise industry world. Klein says he chooses to no longer cruise, but you have to wonder if cruise lines would let him back on!<br /><br />First, let me say that I respect greatly what Klein is doing here. There are trillions of dollars being spent on convincing people to take cruises, to \\"live the life of luxury\\". Hardly any money is spent on telling people what a cruise is REALLY about, what to REALLY expect, what is not included, what the problems are. You can dig through forums, but there is no coordinated Consumer Reports of the cruise industry. Klein uses his 300 days of cruise ship experience plus research to draw together the state of cruising.<br /><br />That being said, I think that exposing the cruise ship industry as one that is doomed to fail because it is socially and environmentally irresponsible is alarmist. These things have been going on for CENTURIES. If you look back through resort life and travel, it has always been the wealthy that go, and the extremely poor that serve. That is hardly the \\"fault\\" of modern cruise ships! I've been on trips through europe, Costa Rica, Cancun. You have mega-hotels with gorgeous foods - and you have incredibly poor waiters and housekeepers who grind day and night to scrape out a living and survive in a one-room shack.<br /><br />I'm not saying that is good! But I'm saying to blame the cruise industry for it makes no sense. It's a matter of supply and demand. Resort travellers - be they on land or at sea - whine if the price is too high. So the resort supplier tries to find the cheapest employees that they can. Those employees tend to come from third world nations where there is little hope for money in any other situation. Those people WANT to work at the resorts, because the peanuts they make is still better than the starvation they face otherwise. The resort then makes money because they pay little to the employees, but get good money from the visitors.<br /><br />On lines where they employ waiters that demand higher salaries, the fare is therefore higher, and people pay more. Those expensive lines certainly exist. But as long as people demand bargain-basement prices and push for those low fares, the lowest wage individuals are going to be hired.<br /><br />I do think this at least makes it clear to cruisers why they MUST PAY GOOD TIPS. Those poor waiters and room cleaners are barely making $2/hr in many cases. They work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, for tiny amounts of money. You whine about your $10/day tip - but to those workers, that is their life's savings that is going back to support their entire family at home. In many cases they are away from that family for a year or more, working hard daily to support them.<br /><br />Yes, cruise ships dump waste into the sea, that is what boats do. It's allowed by law. We can change the laws if we want - where will the waste go? Will local ports \\"accept\\" that waste for free, to process it? Can they even handle the waste if they were paid to do so? These are issues that can be debated, but again to yell at the cruise ships for doing something legal and normal makes little sense to me.<br /><br />Certainly, small towns have a love-hate relationship with cruise boats. The cruises bring in money, but bring in large volumes of tourists. This is hardly unique with cruises, though. I see this *exact* same thing at small skiing towns, at local islands, at Cape Cod. Just about anywhere that there is natural beauty, you have the locals and the hordes that come in on vacation. It's always been something I've pondered, but what can you do? Lock the tourists out? Insist only locals can enjoy the natural beauties?<br /><br />This is a good book to rent from the library, to feel that you've gotten the whole story about cruising. But I really don't see this as an indictment of the cruise industry as much as a commentary - ongoing for centuries - about how the middle-class and wealthy are so tight fisted that they whine about tipping the staff even as they spend hundreds of dollars on \\"leisure activity\\" - while around them people starve. A cruise is never necessary. If you're going to cruise, at least consider the people who make it possible and reward them as liberally as you can for their part in your experience.le-class and wealthy are so tight fisted that they whine about tipping the staff even as they spend hundreds of dollars on \\"leisure activity\\" - while around them people starve.

You get a little taste of everything.<br /><br />First, you get about 100 pages on the basics of cruising - how to get a good price, what to wear, how a cruise ship works. That will get you started on what a cruise trip is all about.<br /><br />Next, you get 300 pages on the actual cruise ships. While this seems like a ton of pages, they actually only do 1-2 page reviews of each ship in most cases. In many cases it's a review not just of that ship but of that ship class. For example if Carnival has 4 ships that are similar, you could get one review that covers all 4 ships, with small mentions of things that stand out on a given ship. Since no ship is REALLY identical to other ships, this isn't great.<br /><br />That being said, I really found the information given here to be FAR more valuable than in similar books. They actually review based on real information from real humans, not just copying from the cruise line's book. They tell you about \\"ridiculous 108 square feet\\" cabins. They warn you that on the Promenade deck, you're likely to have joggers running past (and peering in) your windows. They warn you which areas are noisy, they point out which lounges are usually not found by the masses and therefore are perfect places to escape from the noise.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a quite good write-up of the main port locations. Many people travel in to a port town and consider the port town part of their vacation. This area includes maps of the area, what to see, directions to the docks, and other information.<br /><br />I was a little put off by the 2005 in the title, implying that you had to buy a new book every year. On one hand you want to get a relatively new set of information - but even with this being \\"2005\\" I found errors in pricing. Obviously they can't update every single page in this every year. So it's a trade-off. Again, the book provides good guidelines but should never be taken as absolutely true.<br /><br />There is obviously no way that one book can cover ALL information on all towns, ships and ports!! Again, this is a sampler. You look through to find out which items appeal to you. Then you should get a full book on that ONE TOPIC. If you're going to Bermuda, don't expect this book to give you the full details. You should get a book on Bermuda.<br /><br />However, for what this book does, it does it very well. It takes you from the point of not knowing about cruising at all to the point of knowing what your options are and having a top-5 list to persue further. At that point it's time to go to those cruise line websites, to go the forums, and to get some books on specific ports. That will get you the detailed information you need to make your final decision, and to enjoy your cruise!n, the book provides good guidelines but should never be taken as absolutely true.<br /><br />There is obviously no way that one book can cover ALL information on all towns, ships and ports!! Again, this is a sampler. You look through to find out which items appeal to you. Then you should get a full book on that ONE TOPIC. If you're going to Bermuda, don't expect this book to give you the full details. You should get a book on Bermuda.<br /><br />However, for what this book does, it does it very well.

Where certain other low carb books are thinly veiled attempts to bash the lifestyle, the Idiot's Guide explains why this way of life is so healthy. <br /> <br />The book is primarily full of great low carb recipes. There are breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, desserts, and even an entire section dedicated to kid-friendly meals. <br /> <br />These aren't obscure meals that take a gourmet to appreciate. They are quick, easy, and very tasty. You get a lightning chicken stew, almond oatmeal cookies, meatloaf, chicken marsala, and tostadas. There are meals for vegetarians, meals for steak-lovers, and everyone in between.  <br /> <br />There's also information on low carbing, if you somehow got this book without knowing what a low carb diet is about. There's background information about carbs, about how our modern diet is overloaded with sugar. It encourages you to eat fresh fruits and veggies, to find balance in your food.	2005-06-04

They are going to tell us the \\"real\\" truth behind the corporate line. How well does this book live up to its promise?<br /><br />First, the basics of the book. The first 130 pages holds background information - why cruises are cost effective, maps of key cruising regions, and so on. The rest of the book - which is about 660 pages total - is a ship by ship review of the main ships that you can choose to cruise on.<br /><br />I bought this book, so obviously I was keen to hear the \\"secrets\\" :) But unfortunately, even though this version of the book came out only a year ago, I already see a large number of inaccuracies in it. It's not really a surprise - as much as they claim to be \\"unofficial\\", there is no way a group of reviewers (or especially the 2 who claim primary credit for writing this book) can go back and visit every ship listed, every year. But that means that either 1) the information is therefore inaccurate, or 2) they fall back on what the company reports, meaning they are no longer an unbiased 3rd party.<br /><br />In addition, just what information are they giving you? I turned right to the Norwegian Majesty as I am looking to cruise with them shortly. They give stats like cabin count, draft, beam, etc. Undoubtedly they got those from the cruise lines, and didn't measure them themselves :). They list the decor colors, the names of the restaurants, the items in the cabins (desk, TV, etc.)<br /><br />Really, the entire review (which is about 2 small pages long) is a transcript of information found on corporate pages. It says things like the Sky Deck has lounge chairs, rest rooms and showers. It really doesn't have any subjective information at all.<br /><br />With the thousands of reviews available online, from people who DO go into the good, bad and ugly of each cruise line, I have to admit I was disappointed. Let's say I wanted to choose between the several cruise lines running to Bermuda, I don't know that these write-ups would really help over the official information found on the cruise ships' websites. With the information in the book not necessarily being accurate or up-to-date, even what they do show isn't something I could rely on fully. And given how much the price is for this book, it's really not very price-effective given how few pages are actually applicable for a given person.<br /><br />That's not to say that the book is \\"bad\\" in any way. The beginning section is quite helpful, if basic. It talks about planning ahead, making sure you're in town a day early so that you don't risk missing your ship.  It gives general advice on what to pack.<br /><br />But again, you really do far better with web offerings - because instead of giving general advice on packing for \\"all cruises everywhere\\" (which has to include both Alaska and Jamaica), the web can give specific advice for specific lines going to specific destinations. Even two ships both going to a single island can have vastly different dress codes.<br /><br />If someone doesn't have a web connection, and wants a general quick-reference book for scanning (say in the waiting room of a travel agency), this might be a good book to have. But if you're a cruiser who has a destination in mind, or a specific cruise ship in mind, this information is really far too brief.e write-ups would really help over the official information found on the cruise ships' websites.

US	52759271	R1I2OH7U0XFRDG	0446671002	58848637	The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure	Books	4	187	204	N	N	Is it a coincidence that you're reading this review?	It's amazing how people are diametrically opposed about this book. One group feels the book is incredibly simplistic and regurgitates messages already clearly explained by many other books. Another group feels the book is amazingly powerful and brings new insights not seen before. I think that very gulf shows why the book is so important. The book holds information both groups say is very important. The first group says \\"but you should have read this before, and understood it more completely, without the dumbing-down\\". If the second group is saying \\"this is new and amazing!\\" it's pretty clear they had never heard the message before despite the other books. This second group was now hearing it in a language that appealed and made sense.<br /><br />In essence, James has studied many religions and philosophies, and distilled many of the common core thoughts down into a \\"9 step program\\". He's wrapped it up in a Peruvian / religious atmosphere, and then had an average, every day guy learn about it in less than a week. We, the reader, get to learn it along with him. Each step is even numbered and clearly explained to you, in very simple words and ideas.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />The nine insights are:<br /><br />1. Life is full of meaningful coincidences<br /><br />2. Mankind decided to focus from 1500-2000 on simply creating a happy material life<br /><br />3. An invisible energy field exists everywhere, based on beauty<br /><br />4. Mankind competes for this psychic energy - feeling good at each others' expenses<br /><br />5. If you appreciate beauty and love people, you share psychic energy rather than steal it<br /><br />6. You need to understand your childhood-based issues to overcome them<br /><br />7. Trust in your intuitions, listen to your dreams<br /><br />8. Others bring you new insights, but avoid being addicted to a person for energy<br /><br />9. Groups energize members jointly helping all to become more happy<br /><br />So it's an odd mix of philosophy and spiritual beliefs. Of course, I really like that #1 makes it hard to criticize all of the amazingly silly plot devices in the book. How can you question the coincidences, when insight #1 says that coincidences magically appear when necessary? Heck, that means any badly written book is simply on its way to spiritual enlightenment :)<br /><br />A number of the 'basis' for these beliefs are simply untrue. #2 says that in 1500, because we turned our back on religion, we focussed suddenly on making our life an easier one. But any student of history knows that man has *always* worked to make life easier - and that we have always sought religion. Sure, we sought a 'change' in the 1500s - but we sought a change in year 0 with Jesus. We sought changes many times over the years, and religions have evolved to match our current needs.<br /><br />I have a serious issue with the many references to beauty meaning \\"long, slender\\" women and vivid colors. The point of beauty should be to appreciate each person in their natural shape - not to swoon at long, slender women and bright red flowers. Every object has an innate beauty which is not necessary slender nor bright. The push on vegetarianism is a little over-the-top. The \\"seeing smoke between fingers held an inch apart\\" is actually a well known child's optical illusion, where you see a floating finger if you unfocus your eyes. Having scientists who claim \\"how can you postulate the existence of anything before you get proof\\" is plain silly - the whole point of science is to have experiments to prove or disprove things. You *always* start with a postulation to then prove or disprove.<br /><br />It also really bugs me that the \\"hero\\" cares so little about the people around him. He's started on his quest by Charlene who really wants to find the manuscript - but never thinks to call her and tell her of his discoveries. A guy he meets on the plane is shot down right next to him, but the hero abandons him and rarely thinks of him. There are occasonal \\"ooops I hope she's OK\\" (mostly about the girl he lusts after) but that's it. And this for a guy who is on the spiritual fast track.<br /><br />There are also oversimplifications that are quite wrong. They claim that the only reason conflict occurs is that one side \\"holds on to irrational positions for energy purposes\\". Ah, so apparently when you have a couple where the guy wants to have children and the woman does not, one of them must be irrational. Sometimes conflicts exist because two people simply want different things for very rational reasons.<br /><br />But on the other hand, there ARE many quite useful pieces of information in here, for people who have honestly never heard them before. Maybe they simply don't read books about philosophy or have friends that enjoy these discussions. There is a great section (insight 6, for those keeping track) about how most people learn in childhood to be an interrogator, intimidator, aloof or poor-me person. It develops as a reaction to your parents' styles. If your parents tended to yell at you a lot, you probably learned to be meek to get them to stop. If your parents ignored you a lot, you probably acted out to get their attention. These are things talked about in many pyschology books, but they are nicely distilled into easy-speak here. And truly, if you've never thought about these things or looked to understand why you are the way you are, it can be very educational to take a step back and find a way to move beyond your childhood issues.<br /><br />There are also many feel-good messages in here. You're told to keep your goals and 'questions' in mind, and look for positive assistance in your daily life. You're told to take each hurdle as a new opportunity to grow, and to have a positive outlook on life. You're told to avoid dwelling on negative images, to instead build positive images and goals in your mind and work towards them. This is rather good information for any human being. You're told to seek true happiness in your own world - and then to share it with another. You're told not to become co-dependent - not to seek another to \\"make\\" you happy. You need to be happy as an individual, and then share your happy world with others.<br /><br />There are even more specific feel-good messages. You're told to eat slowly, savoring each bite with the pleasure and nutrition it brings you. Many, many doctors have found that this leads to more healthy eating, healthy digestion and a maintaining of a good body weight. You're also told to only have as many kids as you can give a lot of healthy attention to. If you have a lot of kids, you have to divide your attention up between them, setting the stage for sibling rivalry. Also, the kids begin to 'raise each other' - meaning now the kids have inappropriate 'kid' role models teaching them poor lessons of how to be a 'happy person' - vs having a mature adult being a role model. Having other kids around as friends is great - but there always needs to be ample adult full-time attention so that each child has as much adult time and attention as they need.<br /><br />The book really fizzles at the end, though. Where at least the main story had these insights sprinkled in with the silly coincidences and super-fast, super-shallow progress, the end seems like it was tacked on. It's not really an ending - it's more of a \\"Oh! There's a 10th insight, but you'll have to read the next book to learn about that.\\" We learn that in the next 500 years, we will have a life with a ton of food and money, but that people will not become lazy or overindulgent. Yeah, right :) Remember us in the 1500s? If they saw our life now, they would think we had a life of incredible wealth and ease. Most of them were starving peasants with no books, heat or air conditioning. Only a tiny few were wealthy and well fed. So here in modern times many of us live the life of luxury - and we are fat and lazy :) To think that in 500 years the entire human population will suddenly become balanced and in love with each other is rather optomistic. Some might - but some will always resist.<br /><br />So in the end, the book is a great, simple introduction for many people into the basics of philosophy and psychology. Hopefully it will get those people to take a look at their lives and try to be more positive and more aware of how they affect others. Many it'll encourage them to discuss issues with friends and family, and to read more books on the topic. If the book really achieves some of those goals, then its Indiana-Jones storyline and oversimplification can certainly be accepted as the 'chewable vitamin' method of delivery!to seek true happiness in your own world - and then to share it with another.

US	52759271	RNE0WAEJM0MY7	0380012863	129257055	Jonathan Livingston Seagull	Books	4	324	346	N	N	A short book with great meaning	It's really amazing that this book, published in 1970, got onto the top sellers of all time list. It is barely 127 pages long - and that includes many pages of seagull photos, with very few words per page. The margins are very large :) It's a story about a seagull who, unlike his comrades, is not happy yelling \\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\\" for food. He loves to soar, and fly. He faces rejection and ridicule for his quest for greater heights. And of course, he inspires all of us to reach for our goals.<br /><br />So first, obviously this book is REALLY short. I just re-read it and, without racing at all, I was done in 16 minutes. It's very short. There aren't long, drawn out characterizations here. Jonathan learns to fly well in about 2 pages, and by page 31 he is fully aware of all of his skills. By page 57 he in \\"Heaven\\" - or at least in another stage of life in with like-minded seagulls, speaking with telepathy. Chiang is the elder there who tells Jonathan that there actually is no Heaven - that Heaven is the state of being perfect. Jonathan decides to return to Earth and help others. He spends a few pages teaching Fletcher his skills, and then vanishes, leaving Fletcher to teach the new seagull students how to fly. The story ends.<br /><br />Really, the story here is that Jonathan and Fletcher were not \\"special\\" in any way. The point is made many times that they were seagulls like any others. The difference is that they chose to strive to better themselves. They were not content to merely eat and sleep. They wanted to become really good at what they could do - fly. The elders explain that for many people, this process takes many lifetimes. If you do well in a given life, you graduate to a \\"higher\\" life where you can then work with people on your next stage of progress. If you just get by in your current life, then you get reborn into that same level, to have another chance to strive.<br /><br />So it's very interesting how different people have interpreted this book to be a religious tome. Christians often say that Jonathan stands for Jesus. He was born \\"with men\\" - he learns his special skills, and then he returns to earth to help guide mankind to be better. There's even a mob scene where the \\"normal seagulls\\" try to kill Jonathan for being different. On the other hand, the story clearly says there is no Heaven - that the point of life is to keep trying and trying until you figure out your own path to perfection. The reincarnation and perfection-from-within is very Buddhist. It's not an external God that gives you this perfection. You are born with the innate ability to attain perfection - but it is up to you to find the desire and take the steps to reach it.<br /><br />I've owned this book for many years and do enjoy it. But I do have to say that it is REALLY short and really basic. The whole Jonathan evolution is barely touched on. You don't get much sense of growth as he instantly goes from normal seagull to glowing Special Seagull. This is sort of a theological primer for those who don't normally read books on philosophy. There are many, many books out there that get into these sorts of topics in a far more meaningful way. But on the other hand, much as the Matrix series got many non-philosophy students to learn about some pretty basic philosophical ideas, this book also opened the door for many people on the ideas of striving for inner perfection. If you handed all of these people a complex tome on the topic, they probably wouldn't have read it. But maybe by getting that door opened, and that interest piqued, they then went forward and learned more. You have to get that interest started somewhere. If the interest came from a super-short, super easy to read, picture-filled booklet, does it really matter?<br /><br />On a personal note, I really do feel that people need to sit back and consider what they spend their hours each day doing. We only have one life - and most of us who can afford to buy books have an amazing wealth of luck that 90% of the world's population dreams of having. We have clothes, we have places to sleep, we have access to healthy food and water. It would be a wonderful thing if each of us spent even a portion of our day reaching out to help others, to help the world become a better place for us all to live in. We don't need to watch TV - there are other far more important things to do in life.uck that 90% of the world's population dreams of having.

The characters involved are thinly disguised historical figures, and the main character is based on a real Englishman - Will Adams. I am a HUGE huge fan of Shogun. Those who have only seen the mini-series really need to read the book. It goes into all sorts of layers and sub-layers that aren't even touched on in the mini-series version.<br /><br />Your basic story is of a Dutch pilot, who becomes known as Anjin, who crash-lands in Japan with his crew. The crew is immediately locked up, but Anjin is brought out to talk with the local samurai. The Portuguese priests are very upset at the thought of English ships reaching their rich treasure-trove of trade. Soon there are political battles between the priests who get great wealth by negotiating with the Japanese, and Anjin who provides the Japanese with a fresh view of world politics.<br /><br />Along the way, Anjin falls in love with Mariko, who is the wife of one of the archers. The lead Shogun - Toronaga - encourages this romance as a way to keep Anjin under control. Toronaga is in his own battles for control with an arch-rival. So there are many different conflicts going on. The Japanese are fighting amongst themselves for control of the island. They need the Portuguese priests, but don't want to be taken advantage of by them. They want the knowledge that Anjin has - but don't want to risk yet another complex control situation with England.<br /><br />Anjin begins by seeing the Japanese as a heathen, backwards group of people. But as time goes on, he becomes one of them, appreciating the value of a soak in the bathtub, enjoying the healthy food, appreciating the music and manners and artistry of the culture.<br /><br />Where other top selling books are usually about sex, violence and drugs, Shogun wraps all of those things in an incredible amount of historical research. Yes, there's some sex. The book loves to highlight the geisha and openness of naked bodies that are found in Japan. There's violence - the samurai are shown as accepting death readily and chop off the head of a villager who does not show respect. People are tortured. I suppose there are no drugs in the story :) But none of these things are put in for a tittilation factor, to bludgeon you over the head. They are all provided in context, to help show visibly the difference between Anjin's view of morality and life and death and the views of the Japanese he now lives with.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is in the little touches. So many books are written with little care for three dimensional characters and realistic environments. James poured incredible amounts of time and effort into travelling to locations to get the actual details right. He went to the Vatican to make sure he got the details of the church's influence correct. When you read this book, you get an incredibly gripping tale. But not only that, when you are done, you really do know a lot more about an important culture, about why they were the way they were and how people lived and died back then. I think that's an amazing achievement, to have combined historical fact with a well written story involving people you grow to care a great deal about.<br /><br />Highly recommended.me sex.

He set it in a real house this time, based on a real legend. This Holmes tale has been voted by many groups as the best of all Holmes stories. Indeed, there are at least 30 different versions of dramatizations of the story.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the story isn't a typical puzzle where Holmes works through the clues one by one while you watch. Instead, we get some brief time with Holmes and Watson at the beginning, as they interact with a Doctor. Then Watson goes off with the Doctor and Sir Henry Baskerville, recently come over from Canada. It turns out Henry is now owner of a manor in the Baskervilles. The family has been under a curse involving a large hound. In fact the reason the home is now his is that his relation was apparently slain by such a hound.<br /><br />So Watson goes along Sir Henry to keep an eye on things, while Holmes sits home. The entire story is told from Watson's point of view, only of Watson's observations. Instead of watching Holmes work, we get more of a \\"storytelling\\" sense here. We hear about the melancholy gloom of the home. We hear often of the quiet loneliness of the moors, with the fog rolling in. It is very much a story of atmosphere, of haunting cries in the night and mysterious faces in the dark.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, the key to the puzzle is withheld from the audience meaning we aren't allowed to \\"solve\\" the case with Watson or Holmes. This is disappointing - I enjoy mystery stories where I feel I have a chance of reading the clues properly. Also, the key instigator is quite intelligent - but the end aim of these machinations seems rather suspect. In fact, in the story Watson asks Holmes just what the apparent plan was, and Holmes himself says he doesn't quite know. Which is also a bit frustrating.<br /><br />It is rather refreshing to have a top selling book that doesn't involve sex or drugs, although there is of course violence here. There are at least two murders in the course of the story. But the focus is on the fact of the murder and the seeking of justice - not on gory details of the actual scenes.<br /><br />At only 100 or so pages, this is well recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story!ther refreshing to have a top selling book that doesn't involve sex or drugs, although there is of course violence here.

It's all about three young women who go to New York starting just after World War II and who use their beautiful bodies to skyrocket to fame and fortune. They realize that the high life isn't all it's cracked up to be, as they use drugs, booze, sex to maintain their perfect worlds. Disaster results.<br /><br />Valley of the Dolls is said by many to be the top selling fiction book of all time. Compared to many of the other over-sex-filled books that made this list, Valley of the Dolls is actually relatively tame. When the story begins in 1946, the main characters are all young and at different stages of innocence. You have Anne, a sweet 20 yr old Massachusetts girl who dreams of passionate love and family, after she has a career for herself. She's happy being a secretary. You have Neely, a sweet 17 year old vaudeville dancer / singer who works with her family and wants to be a showbiz girl while she finds a guy to marry and have kids with. And finally you have Jenny, who is 25 and whose mom pushes her to marry rich. She's the only non-virgin - she married a European noble in hopes of cash, but divorced him quickly when she found out he was actually poor.<br /><br />So for the first 100 pages or so (out of 442), you just get setup. Anne is incredibly innocent, with parents who want her to simply marry a local boy and settle down. Neely is a young sparker, who leaps to every new challenge with energy and enthusiasm. Jenny is resolute in her aim to make money, keeping her body well oiled and cared for to reach her goals. The three become roommates as they each persue their goals. All three want to marry well, that is their end goal.<br /><br />Ironically of course, when they draw close to their goals they find they want more. Neely does in fact marry the guy she chases after - but when she drags him out to Hollywood with her, she bores of him quickly and wants a divorce. Jenny marries a rich singer despite the objections of the singer's sister - but divorces him when he sleeps around and she realizes he has a genetic mental problem that would affect their kids. Anne turns down a millionare to stay with a writer she loves passionately - but he abandons her to focus on his writing efforts. She keeps pining after him even while she moves on to other affairs.<br /><br />And so it goes. Anne becomes a cosmetics girl cover-girl, and of the three is the sanest. She sleeps with the boss and plans on marrying him in a while. She's not hooked on drugs. But Jenny and Neely are both addicted to uppers and downers by now. Neely has destroyed her career several times over by being a prima-donna. Her second husband divorces her and she never spends any time with her kids. Jenny finally finds a rich senator to love - and dreams of marrying him and having kids. But breast cancer and uterine issues hit, and she doesn't trust the senator to stay with her with these problems. Life unravels.<br /><br />On one hand, the characters tend to be on the cardboardy side. There is the super-naive Anne, who believes at face value that the millionaire is poor, that the Ethel Merman-style Broadway Star is really sweet and kind, and so on. She clings to her belief in true, soulmate passionate love and lets go her hopes for family and home as a result. There's the fresh-faced Neely who claims she only wants a family and kids, and would quit her career to focus on the family - but as soon as she gets fame, she adores it. But she loses her fame because of her nose-up attitude and pill-taking. Jenny just keeps searching for a sugar daddy that can also give her kids, but just when she thinks things are set, his fascination with her body and her illness make it seem like a lost cause.<br /><br />The guys are not much better. You have the rich my-way-or-the-highway millionaire. You have the playboy writer who runs off to be on his own. You have the sex-only-simpleton whodoes what he's told by his sister. You have countless guys who only want a mistress or a one-night-stand. And then you have a few father figures. You have very few real \\"partners\\" in life.<br /><br />On the other hand, when you look at the other top sellers like the Carpetbaggers or God's Little Acre, this book has remarkably little sex. The virgins stay virgins for a long while, until they hook up with true loves. Yes, Jenny had a lesbian affair in Europe for the typical tittilation factor. Yes, you hear about Neely's second husband having homosexual lovers, but there is very little real sex talk. You know that Jenny trades sex for fur coats, but it's more about the fur coats than the sex. What is more the focus of the book is the way the womens' goals keep changing - and how they sabotage their own lives. Neely especially blames everyone else around her for her unhappiness, when it's pretty clear that it is her own warped focus that does it.<br /><br />I can definitely see why this appealed to a 60s audience of women. They were all rebelling against the get-married-have-kids mantra, they wanted glamour and excitement. But they also knew that the choice was a risky one. The book clearly showed women who avoided the family-kids route and reached that glamour, and who were not really happy as a result. So on one hand, women got to fantasize about the cool prestigious New York restaurants, the Broadway hits, the rich boyfriends. But on the other hand, women saw the misery and pain involved in that high-profile life, and felt better about their own more quiet worlds.<br /><br />For a more modern audience, it's a little more tough. This isn't the Carrie-Samantha New York smart single girls situation. All three girls long for a guy to solve their problems. Jenny wants a rich guy, and kids. Anne wants a loving guy, and kids. Neely just wants a family guy. The Sex-in-the-City girls get together, they support each other to become better, balanced individuals. It seems like the Valley threesome help each other to get pills, and rarely speak out against bad relationships. They only step in for an intervention when things are completely screwed up. They make completely bad decisions for themselves, with maybe only Anne being at least mostly-sane. This is more a warning about \\"the perils of high living\\" than a real story about the troubles of balancing family and career.<br /><br />Sure, we can see traces of our own desires in the various women. We want romantic love, like Anne. We want financial stability, like Jenny. We want general family contentment, like Neely. But the women are very one-sided and simply not very bright. It's a real shame to say these are what women are like, or how women handle success. And of course, the fact that all are incredibly gorgeous and solely use their bodies to achieve their aims is not stirring. They're constantly praised by men for being sexy. That seems to be all that guys care about. The women spend their time oiling their breasts and putting on make-up and dressing fancy, to be the proper Arm Candy. If they get money, they turn it over to men to do the investing. Wouldn't want to worry their silly little heads about money.<br /><br />So in general, I appreciate this was very liberating and educational for 60s women - but it is more cardboard and simplistic for modern times. I really do find a great comparison between this and the Sex-in-the-City crew. Both have sexy women in New York City. But in this book, the sexy women rely on sexy bodies to catch them a husband of their desired shape, and use pills and drinking and plastic surgery to get their aims. It is shown to be literally impossible to balance a family and a career. That may have been a lesson that Sixties women sadly accepted - but it's one we know it not true in modern times. And hopefully we know better than to focus on a hot body as the main way to find a long-lasting partner in life!does what he's told by his sister.

US	52759271	R2GZ34JUQVW7M0	1568491417	927219378	The Carpetbaggers	Books	3	22	24	N	Y	Sex, Sex, and Some Story	Written in 1961, The Carpetbaggers is really a tale like \\"The Aviator\\" - about a manly rich airplane flyer and maker who gets involved with Hollywood. The references to real life people are so thinly veiled that you sometimes forget that he is pretending to have made up the situations. But then you're jarred back into the fiction, because part of how Harold keeps you hooked is by throwing in gratuitous sex scenes ... constantly.<br /><br />One of the very first references is when Jonas Cord is landing his plane - the landing field is apparently like a female naked body. In a short period of time, Jonas' father dies, and he is immediately raping his step-mom, Rina. He then sleeps his way across the US. He's got a naked daughter upstairs while he negotiates business with the father downstairs. You learn that Rina had slept with her adopted brother for many years as a teen, even becoming pregnant. Rina then made advances on her adopted father, which he rejects in horror. She becomes a bi-sexual for a while, living with her lesbian female teacher in France while also being mistress to an older man.<br /><br />While most of these things might seem ho-hum in modern times, to the 1961 audience, it was incredibly shocking. It would have been enough to put in one such item in the book and to give it meaning - but the situations were just piled one on top of the other in order to keep further shocking the reader. Jennie is drugged and raped! Then she goes to work for an abortionist! Then she has an affair with him, even though he was married! Then she becomes a high-paid whore! There's little chance to develop the character in here, except as the repeated victim of horror after horror.<br /><br />I'm not saying the book is not engrossing. It's 679 pages, and I read it in a single night. But it's more like watching a train wreck, rather than enjoying a good story. I don't mind reading about sex, but the situations were very contrived. The story was focussed on those sex details vs the other things that went on in peoples lives that helped to define them.<br /><br />I was bothered by the many stereotypes in the story. It's about sexy, handsome white rich people. There are a few jewish people - and they are not portrayed very well at all. I believe there's one black person - the butler who is the 'wise dutiful loyal silent type'. The American Indian woman is dutiful and quiet (and of course goes through an explicitly sexual rite before marriage, described in bloody detail).<br /><br />I also disliked the ending of the story. After everything else that went on, it was way too contrived and neat. POOF, characters that really didn't have that much in common suddenly decide to live happily ever after. There are a number of huge plot holes, but I won't give away story details by revealing those. There are occasional sentence structure errors that make it unclear who is speaking, which means you have to re-read a page twice to get the gist of how the discussion progresses.<br /><br />But that all being said, it is interesting how the book is broken up into sections, each about a certain person, and how you go back in time to learn why they became the way they were. It's interesting to hear what people in the 60s thought about culture. There are all sorts of \\"laugh with me!\\" references, as people back in the \\"old days\\" (the story begins in the 20s) think talking movies won't catch on, that plastics is a strange new item, and that World War II will never begin.<br /><br />This is a book to read to understand what the 60s was all about, as people moved from the staid, quiet days of the 50s into the more free-wheeling times of the 60s. It's also a book to read just because it's one of the top selling books of all time, to be able to discuss the ideas in it if someone else brings the topic up.

US	52759271	RF4DNFYMK5MBX	0820316636	71251909	God's Little Acre: A Novel (Brown Thrasher Books Ser.)	Books	4	42	46	N	Y	Historical Value Plus Some Meaning Amongst the Sex	Written in 1933, this story is set in rural Georgia in a time and location of great poverty. It was quite a sensation when it came out, because it was so full of blatant incestuous sex. First, you have Ty Ty who has raised 3 boys and 2 girls on his own. All 3 boys and one sister have married, while the youngest girl, Darling Jill, is a sex-pot sleeping with everyone who she can. Griselda, one of the sisters-in-law, has a gorgeous body and everybody wants to sleep with her. Ty Ty makes sure that he tells everyone he can talk to that her body is really hot and makes a man want to lick her. As you might imagine, disaster results.<br /><br />So in one way the entire story (209 pages) is about guys lusting after girls, girls choosing to accept or reject a given lustful attempt, and the father either saying \\"I want everything to be peaceful\\" while goading every man he meets to sleep with Griselda.<br /><br />There are other layers here too. The entire region is destitute. But while Ty Ty has a large spread of fertile land, he has dedicated the last 15 years of his life to digging gigantic holes in search of gold. He is starving to death - and his two negro share-croppers are also starving. Only 2 of the kids have escaped this hole-digging escapade. One is the married sister, Rosamond. She's married Will, a mill-worker. Unfortunately, the mill has shut down and the entire mill-town is starving. They are holding out for better wages and have lasted a year and a half on the barest of rations. The second is the oldest son, who made a ton of money brokering cotton and now refuses to talk to the rest of the family because of their foolish hole-digging.<br /><br />So Will the mill-worker COULD work, but he and the town are holding out for principles. Ty Ty and his clan COULD farm and feed themselves - but they spend their energy digging holes for gold. There are only 2 non-family-members in the story, Pluto is an overweight man who lusts after Darling Jill. Even he refuses to work. He wants to campaign to be Sheriff, because then he'd be paid for sitting around. Dave is the albino the family grabbed to 'divine' the gold for them. He's married, but after one look at Darling Jill he stays to have sex with her.<br /><br />Even the greed and lust of the men is often only half-hearted. Pluto wants to be Sheriff - but it's usually too hot for him to go talking to voters. Ty Ty gets a desire to have an albino, but then dilly dallies for hours before setting out.<br /><br />The title of the book refers to Ty Ty's land, full of holes. Ty Ty feels he is generous by setting aside one acre to be \\"for God\\" - that all proceeds from the acre will be donated to the church. But in actuality, Ty Ty \\"moves\\" the acre around to make sure that he never digs on it - he doesn't want to risk his gold going to the church. It's the same with other aspects of Ty Ty's life. He feels he's scientific in his hole-digging - but he ropes and grabs an albino man to \\"divine\\" for him where to dig next. He wants his family to be peaceful and happy, while goading every male member to sleep with Griselda. None of the characters are very bright. They all are driven by instincts, usually either sex, or greed, or both. The men all go for what they want. With the exception of Darling Jill who has sex when she wants, the women all sit back and are acted on. Griselda in fact lets Will grab her because he is a \\"real man\\" - and Will's wife watches the entire thing happen, again because Will is a real man.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other disappointing parts of the book. The stereotypes in the book are pretty staggering. This entire family is completely unable to care for themselves. They are animals grabbing for gold and rutting with whoever is nearby. The negros are wide-eyed and simple. They're all starving to death and they don't care. I understand of course they are exaggerations in order to make a point - but when the over-characterizations go to the ludricrous stage, it begins to lose its impact.<br /><br />Also, while the book's sexual exploits are rather tame by today's standards, it is still rather sex-filled. There was a lot of interesting material here - the special acre, the way the people HAD the ability to feed themselves but chose not to do it. The way Ty Ty sought peace while undermining it. But the book instead focusses on the shocking things - of men standing and watching their naked female family members undressing, taking baths, having sex, whatever. You really do not get any sense of any character in the book having dimension. They are either horny men, or sex-object women.<br /><br />That all being said, I really did feel like there was an underlayer here that was interesting. The idea of this special acre of land really touched me. First, Ty Ty moves it around to keep it 'safe' from the gold. Then Ty Ty puts it under the house, where there's no risk of it being involved in a dig attempt. Ty Ty's home is resting on God's Acre. But soon Ty Ty's digging efforts cause his own house to begin to cave in. When Ty Ty realizes that one of his sons is in danger, he desperately tries to set the \\"acre\\" in motion - to always stay beneath his son, and keep him safe.ins to lose its impact.<br /><br />Also, while the book's sexual exploits are rather tame by today's standards, it is still rather sex-filled.

As much as I tend to enjoy the Dummies series in general, though, this book is a bit questionable.<br /><br />I don't mind at all that Dr. Chauncey has written a diet book - I object that she titled it a \\"Low Carb\\" book. She repeatedly refers to this diet as a \\"Whole Foods Eating Plan\\" diet thoroughout the book - sometimes 8 times or more on a given page. She is very much pushing her own diet plan, which in many situations conflicts directly with a low carb plan.<br /><br />In fact she makes many statements *against* low carb dieting, and even promotes some myths about low carb diets that have been disproven by studies. She promotes the drinking of fruit juices, even though most fruit juices have as much sugar (if not more) than soda and few nutrients.<br /><br />There's little things too. She claims broccoli is America's favorite vegetable when clearly statistics show that is the potato. She says that shopping only once a week is great for dieting, when most people find that shopping for fresh food is best for finding great deals that are healthy. She says to avoid chicken wings, which is mind-boggling since most low carb dieters find this to be the ideal low carb food.<br /><br />Dr. Chauncey says \\"don't count carbs in fruits\\" when fruits are often incredibly sugar-filled. Yes they're fine in small amounts, but gorging on fruit is hardly a pathway to health. She continually says to only \\"consider vitamin supplements\\" when there is no way that I know of to get all nutrients you need in a normal daily diet. She explicitly says \\"microwave ovens are great for vegetables\\" when studies have shown that microwaving vegetables destroy many of their nutrients.<br /><br />There are of course some good things in the book. Many of the recipes are quite healthy. She is promoting her own diet which is a mix of low-fat, low-calorie, low-sugar and as a result, some recipes are natural food based and good. But she invents a new green / yellow / red system of coding foods which adds yet another level of complexity to an eating system. The items she puts into each category are not always logical.<br /><br />She does talk about the importance of breakfasts, and the value of asking for healthy substitutions in restaurants. She talks about how, if you cheat, it's important to simply figure out why you did so and make plans to handle it in the future. She discusses how to arrange your fridge and shelves so that healthier foods are in front, so you're more likely to grab those first.<br /><br />But again, those items would be mentioned in any healthy eating book. There certainly are other Dummies books on healthy eating. This book was supposedly positioned as a book on how to do a low carb diet, and it spent a fair amount of the book bashing or contradicting the low carb way. This would be like writing a Dummies books on dogs, and then spending a portion of the time talking about choosing cats instead. It just isn't why people would buy the book.<br /><br />I really recommend that the Dummies crew redo this book with a real low carb writer, and rename the current book to 'Whole Foods Eating Plan for Dummies\\". That, after all, is what Dr. Chauncey refers to her plan as, over and over again.s a new green / yellow / red system of coding foods which adds yet another level of complexity to an eating system.

Each dish has 3 ingredients, is tasty and is very good for you. <br /> <br />First, the variety. People who complain that low carbing is boring haven't taken a look at this cookbook. You get Pan Seared Rib-eye with Agurula. There's pot-roasted turkey with smokey onions. How about broccoli smothered in wine and olive oil? <br /> <br />These dishes are NOT hard. As I said, they all involve just three main ingredients. Some might open your horizons a bit - for example I *love* snow peas, but I know people who have never tried them. I also love pine nuts! They are quite good for you and tasty too. All of these things can be found at your average supermarket, and once you realize the wealth of healthy foods that you like, your menu planning gets more and more interesting. <br /> <br />Each recipe comes with the total carbs, the fiber, fat, saturated fat, protein, calories, and more - so even if you're not low carbing, you can see just how healthy in ALL ways these dishes are. The author feels strongly that eating healthy is about watching all of the problem areas and finding dishes that are fresh, healthy, nutritious and low in harmful items. <br /> <br />My one complaint with this book is that there are no photos of dishes. I LOVE photos to help me get an idea of what a dish is all about. <br /> <br />Even so, I highly recommend this cookbook. It covers everything from breakfasts to desserts, from drinks to appetizers for parties and main dishes. You can easily eat this way every day for years and never get bored - and amaze your friends and family with delicious, healthy dishes. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-03-21

The first book was themed along a western storyline, new sherrif moves into town, ending with a classic standoff scene. In this one, the bad guy gang forms up slowly and then attacks the town, and only Jesse can save the day. <br /> <br />Problem is, as much as I *love* the Parker wit and dialogue in general, I kept hitting huge problems with this plot line. First, after so many books on the Spenser and Jesse series, I am really getting tired of every single one going over this \\"we love each other but can't live together\\" theme. It is beating a dead horse that is decomposing and barely dust any more. Let it go already. <br /> <br />Next, the book has all sorts of unlikely situations moving the plot along in jerks and starts, and then at the end everything miraculously ties up for Jesse without him even doing much of anything.  <br /> <br />A typical Spenser device, the good-hero-stands-up-for-abused-minorities situation, isn't even resolved. So we get the traditional \\"look at those jerk bigots\\" situation that Parker loves to throw into each book and it doesn't even get handled. <br /> <br />Not only that but there are TWO different situations involving females that really drive me crazy. Both involve women and involve a pretty blatant wrongdoing - but because women are involved it is hushed up. Because Lord only knows that women can't be held accountable for what they do - they're just girrrrrls. The guys end up dead - but the situations with women cause criminals to go free. It bugs me to no end. <br /> <br />I really really had high hopes for this series and still have high hopes for its future. I love Parker's style of writing in general. But the direction of his plots is really getting both repetitive and lacking in coherency. I really worry that Parker trying to write 2 or 3 books a year on different series is starting to mean less attention is paid to each one ...	2004-12-27

At this point in time Spenser is getting far too old to keep detecting, a point that many, many readers have made with a grin. Stone is picking up the mantle, and returning to the hard liquor, hard edged attitude that Spenser had back when he was a pup. <br /> <br />You start with Jesse Stone, aged 34, born in Tucson Arizona, staring at the Santa Monica ocean and pondering how he quit the LAPD. Divorced, 6', 175 pounds, he was a point guard in high school and almost went professional in baseball, but for a career-ending injury. Oh yes, he was in the marines, too.  <br /> <br />So he drives his Explorer cross country to the tiny town of Paradise, Massachusetts. The drive takes quite a bit of book to tell. When he gets there, to be their new police chief, he finds a mess. White Supremacists, money laundering, lots of sex. And all through it, you get soap opera scenes of Jesse and his ex-wife Jenn who can't quite live together but can't quite leave each other either. <br /> <br />The writing is classic Spenser style, although in 3rd person. You get both the good and the bad in that sense. I enjoy the wit and the quick paced action, but I really don't like the soap-opera long drawn out scenes where you have to hear for the 800th time how a couple loves each other but has issues with living together.  <br /> <br />Also, a number of the actions of the characters make little sense, and seem like they were thrown in for plot reasons. The ending is very rushed and forced. I really like the idea of a new character to keep this universe going, but I hope that by trying to write three series at once, Parker isn't spreading himself a little thin.	2004-12-22

Wrong! This gourmet cookbook lets you eat like a king and queen while losing weight. <br /> <br />Karen Barnaby begins by sharing her own trials and tribulations at weight loss, and explains how low carb diets work. She gives information on how to shop at a number of locations - Italian deli, Japanese grocery, etc. - to get food that is healthy and delicious. Then, it's on to the recipes!  <br /> <br />For those bored with breakfast, Karen has a number of tasty solutions, from egg and sausage muffins to a deep dish pizza quiche. There are almond puff pancakes and Colin's omega waffles. Moving through the day, she offers a wide variety of appetizer, lunches, snacks, dinners, and yes, desserts.  <br /> <br />If you're thinking these recipes will require \\"unusual\\" ingredients, think again. Sure, some do call for pine nuts or sea salt. Others, however, simply take the food you SHOULD be eating - celery, vegetable oil - and help you find new ways to make it very tasty. There are recipes for stir fried prawns, for turkey tenderloin with pesto, and for strawberry shortcakes with mascarpone balsamic cream. <br /> <br />The photos that are included are mouthwateringly gorgeous and really entice you to give the recipe a try. On the other hand, not every dish has a photo included - something I wish had been different. I always like to see a photo of what I'm trying to make. The instructions are straightforward and simple, and she lists both the effective carbs and total carbs for every dish, along with the fiber, protein, fat and calories. Substitutions are listed where appropriate, to help a chef that runs out of something. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has fallen into a rut with their low carb cooking. And especially if you're planning any get-togethers, this is a sure fire way to show others that low carb creates the most flavorful food on the planet!	2004-10-29

I really have to say this is the book to have to create delicious, healthy summer foods!<br />Grilling is of course just about perfect low carb food - it involves fresh fish, fresh chicken, and lots of fresh vegetables. However, there are a few dishes in classic BBQ that are notoriously high carb, like potato salad and baked beans. Dana helps with everything. <br />There are of course the rubs and marinades, the instructions on grilling and BBQing (and how they differ). There are lots of great spice combos that can be helpful to new cooks, but are second-hand to experienced grillers.<br />Where the book really shines is in the side dishes and extras. The variety of mock-potato salad are great. There are various slaws and salads, plus a wide array of desserts.<br />The drinks section is fun but again, what low carb drinker doesn't know about mixing rum and diet coke? Is vodka plus sugar-free lemonade really worth a mention? I'd much rather have had those pages pointed at appetizers or more side dishes.<br />Still, summertime's parties and picnics will become much easier for low carbers who don't have to worry if something is OK to eat or not. By following the recipes in this book, you're sure to get a delicious dish that is truly low carb and healthy for you.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-06-05

It compares the various diets, explains why they work and offers practical recipes and tips.<br />The book isn't trying to indoctrinate you in the low carb lifestyle. It gives both information on studies supporting low carb as well as the concerns that some have about this lifestyle. It lets you make an educated decision about how to follow a low carb lifestyle.<br />There is a section comparing the main low carb diets - Atkins, carbohydrate addicts, neanderthin, protein power, schwarzbein principle, south beach, sugar busters, Suzanne Somers, and the zone. <br />Many pages are dedicated to carbohydrate counts, to let you judge which foods are better to eat than others as far as the sugar content goes. Then there are almost 200 pages of recipes with full color photos. They range from breakfasts and snacks to salads and full meals. <br />This is a great book to leave out on your coffee table and read in many sittings, looking over the exercises one day, the various diet suggestions on another. A great way to get a grounding in the low carb world.	2004-04-19

Most of the games featured are newer ones, and the graphics they choose to highlight are truly spectacular.<br />Each title lists its platform, release date, developer and editor. A paragraph about each game is given in English, French and German. This means that you don't get a huge amount of depth for each game. But the book is already 600 pages long. If they had in depth information on each game, it would have turned into 2,000 pages and would have cost over $100. Instead, there's just enough about the game for you to see if you're interested in it, at which point you simply go to the web and learn everything you could possibly hope to know about it.<br />The organization of the book is a bit strange. You have &quot;Kings of Action&quot; which includes Metal Gear Solid. You have &quot;Legends of Video Games&quot; which puts Diablo next to Rayman? Then you have Sexy Heroes full of slinky women, and Strange Heroes which holds the wonderful female hero in Syberia. <br />Still, many of these games are blasts from the past, and it's fun to look through screenshots of Diablo and Dungeon Siege and remember the hours and hours we spent playing these games. I do warn that some of the graphics involve sexily clad (or topless) female characters, as one might expect from an industry that at least until recently pushed primarily towards teenage boys as its target audience. <br />Highly recommended for any gamer!	2004-02-26

In The Eyes of Heisenberg, he investigates a world made up of normal humans and eternal beings.<br />This was an earlier work, so you can see a number of themes that Dune explored so well in their infancy here. Normal humans are being genetically manipulated by scientists to help keep society running smoothly. Occasionally a 'super human' is created who can live forever. It is these &quot;optimen&quot; who really control society.<br />Everybody thinks the optimen are naturally intelligent and wise - but they are actually no smarter or dumber than normal humans. They simply have thousands and thousands of years with which to refine their points of view and educate themselves as they wish.<br />Of course normal humans begin to rebel against the restrictions in their life and by the end of the story, a male and female want to have a baby the &quot;old fashioned way&quot;.<br />I found a number of flaws with the story, and the ending was rather abrupt and made you feel like it was rushed. The beauty of the story is with the character development and the interactions. Having worked for a biotech, the techno-babble about the DNA was interesting, but it unnecessarily confused things for most readers, and the intriguing events brough up are never resolved. It's as if Herbert originally intended to make a hard core story, but then wandered off into a personality drama and at the end wasn't sure what to do so sort of tied everything up randomly.<br />If you're wondering what Heisenberg had to do with all of this, he's the Quantum Mechanics physicist who came up with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - &quot;The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa.&quot; In essence, when you try to focus too closely on one thing, you aren't able to focus on other things. You can only give a probability of WHERE something is if you're focussing on HOW FAST it is going.<br />Another way of looking at this is that by focussing on something, you are altering it. So while you then may figure out what it is you are examining, you have changed other aspects of it. If you bounce a light beam off of something to see how far away it is, you might actually move it or alter its course with that bounce.<br />In any case, a good story to see more of Herbert's work, but not a classic like Dune.on HOW FAST it is going.<br />Another way of looking at this is that by focussing on something, you are altering it.

There are many ethnic recipes, everything from soup to desserts, lots of appetizers, main dishes, salads, snacks, and more. <br />A nice feature of the cookbook is that the ingredient &quot;grid&quot; shows the regular carbs, effective carbs, fat and protein for EVERY ingredient. So if you start substituting things to suit your own tastes, it's very easy to know exactly how that changes the carb count.<br />There aren't any photos of food, but the descriptions and information make it pretty clear what each dish is about.

The Parsifal Mosaic is very involving and complex, and in general great fun.<br />Without giving away the inner layers of the story, Michael Havelock is a US spy with a tortured past, who has finally found some happiness with a fellow spy, Jenna Karasova. Unfortunately, he is shown that Jenna is a double agent, and watches her die for her betrayal. Preparing to abandon his agent-life and retire to become a teacher, he catches a glimpse of Jenna, alive, at a chance meeting in Europe. The chase is on, as he tries to track down Jenna and figure out why she's alive, and who was deceiving who.<br />There are a variety of interesting locations, from the docks of Italy to meeting rooms in Washington DC. The characters each seem to have an outward 'mask' plus an inner 'motive', and Michael moves from scene to scene trying to unravel it all.  There are twists and turns as he gets closer and further away from the truth.<br />Maybe it's because I've read so many mysteries and thrillers, but I do have to say that a few things disappointed me. First, many of the situations were extremely staged and obvious. There were many things that I guessed long before the characters did, and with the lead characters made out to be extremely intelligent and quick, it was hard to believe they were still muddling through something for chapters after it had been made obvious.  For example, Michael recognizes one of the guys killing Jenna  - Michael knows he knows him but doesn't remember WHO he is. Throughout the rest of the story, while trying to figure out what is going on, he never bothers to try to track this guy down. The identity of the two main secret characters was pretty obvious from the get-go but of course Michael doesn't figure it out until the very end.<br />There were many &quot;this situation proves that I am a master spy&quot; setups that were clumsy and showed if anything that the people around him were completely clueless. I'm all for helping people learn &quot;how spies act&quot; and that &quot;Michael was very good at spotting discrepancies&quot; but if you read Spenser or Bond stories, that is done in a subtle, intelligent way. In this book it was more like a hammer slamming a staple. Rather overkill.<br />And finally, the dialogue is over the top. It seems every page has &quot;Oh my God!&quot; or &quot;Christ!&quot; or &quot;Jesus!&quot; or &quot;You Bastards!&quot; It's sort of like wading through a spy soap opera :)<br />Don't get me wrong - I do enjoy Ludlum a great deal and ripped through the book in a single evening. I enjoyed the ride, but I did keep feeling like I was hitting a &quot;speed bump&quot; along the way that I'd have to roll my eyes about, and then keep going.

As usual for this day and age - this is decades before civil rights, remember - the white cops brush it off as meaningless. Only Marlowe shows some interest in what is going on, and the lug of a man that desperately misses his lost love.<br />Marlowe, pretty down on his luck and drinking hard, pries into the situation as much out of intellectual boredom as anything else. He's not after money, and indeed half the time he's not getting any. He's after making some difference in the world, no matter how small. He's after doing his part to help out those in need. These qualities of honor are taken up by many detectives who came after Marlowe, and are admired by millions of movie viewers who saw the movie version of this book.<br />The gritty world that Marlowe lives in, the desperate state that many of the characters are in, the racism and disregard for the poor and drug use were all harsh realities of Los Angeles in the 1940s. In that swamp of despair roamed Marlowe, barely keeping his own head above water, but determined to do the right thing. It's his doggedness and his adherence to his own rules that make him a man to be admired throughout the ages ... and it's Chandler's brilliant writing style that brings this world to life.<br />Those reviewers who cringe at the drinking, the despair and the racism should thank Chandler for bringing these realities into such clear view, instead of blaming Chandler for showing them a glimpse of a life beyond their air conditioned living rooms.	2003-07-13

The Big Sleep features a complex plot and a fantastic character - Philip Marlowe.<br />Chandler set his story in the gritty streets of Los Angeles, with a detective who was known for doing the right thing rather than what he was told to do. Philip Marlowe became an instant icon not only amongst mystery and detective fans, but among readers everywhere. When this became a movie in 1945 with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, even though the movie cut out a lot of the plot complexities, the characters affected the lives of millions.<br />Chandler's writing style is simply phenomonal. He describes the ins and outs of the city and its suburbs, giving you vivid impressions of that world. He moves from lush mansions to dingy bars, with each character having strong motivations, backgrounds, reasons for being. <br />In a time when minorities were discounted as meaningless and women were considered the &quot;lesser sex&quot;, Marlowe plows right in with a fair eye for all. He takes on work with blacks that others disdain. He treats women as being intelligent while others discount them. The stories talk about homosexuality and porn and other topics as a &quot;part of life&quot;. It's interesting how much of the books had to be 'white washed' to be made into movies.<br />If you read this story and then read many of today's detective stories, you can see clear traces of what Chandler began in the works of others. His style, his incredible humor, his honor and justice. His desire to do what was right even when others around him pushed him to do the &quot;easy thing&quot;. A Big Sleep is a must read for any mystery fan, to see where it all began.	2003-07-13

He's getting his life under control, he's right on top of the bad guys, and his honorable intentions save the day.<br />In this outing, Chandler is hired by a rich woman to track down a missing coin. The woman assumes that a misbehaving family member has run off with it, but of course the story ends up far more complex than that and Marlowe wends his way through gritty LA streets in search of the truth.<br />Marlowe's penchant for doing the right thing is even more in evidence here, as he works to help out characters that many times don't realize they need help. He does it not for fame or fortune, but because it's the right thing to do.<br />Chandler's writing style shines with its usual brilliance, and he crafts his characters with an easy hand. He has brought Marlowe along from his initial hard-drinking despair into a detective who - buoyed with past successes - is now more comfortable with himself and taking better care of himself. The wit crackles, and the novel is as enjoyable and entertaining as anything Chandler has written.	2003-07-13

Paul is the 15-year-old kid, and his parents are using him in an adolescent tug-of-war game. Neither really cares much about Paul, and Paul has retreated into apathetic shrugs. When Spenser brings Paul back from Mel's, Patty doesn't really care and makes Spenser babysit Paul for the night because she's &quot;busy&quot;. Off goes Spenser to read &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; by Barbara Tuchman.<br />Spenser feels sorry for Paul and ends up a live-in bodyguard and fends off Buddy and another guy - at which point Paul starts to show some interest in life. Spenser tries to be a good role model for Paul. Becoming in essence a permanent babysitter while Patty &quot;hides&quot;, Spenser teaches Paul how to build a cabin in Maine. Paul has a simple-fix-the-kid plan which involves teaching Paul to run, box and dress nicely and that suddenly the kid will gain control. Sure enough, it works, even though in real life the chance of success would have been nil. That's a pretty soap-opera solution to the difficult problems of adolescence.<br />Spenser and Susan comment that &quot;It's early autumn for Paul&quot; - that he has to grow up quickly to escape from his difficult parents. Spenser pretty much explains his entire philosophy of life and means of living to both Paul and to the reading audience. He has numerous literary quotes.<br />Hawk refuses a hit commission on Spenser for only 5K. Spenser and Susan, the &quot;surrogate perfect parents&quot;, take Paul on trips to New York and Boston, and in the end Spenser blackmails Paul's parents so Paul can fulfill his secret dream to go off to Ballet school.<br />This book is the first attempt by Parker to really lay out what Spenser is all about - and Spenser does so with endless quotes and rambling dialogues to Paul. He can't do it with Susan - Susan is in a snit from the very beginning and pretty much snaps at Spenser every time she sees him. On the other hand, Susan is buddy-buddy with Hawk, which is strange because the last time they were in the same story together, Susan barely knew him.<br />Spenser has grown in many ways in this story. His moral code has been structured. His &quot;readiness is all&quot; attitude has been shaped. Where only a few stories ago he set men up to be killed, in this one he refuses to shoot a man even though he knows that man is a serious risk to him.

Parker's fifth book about the Boston sleuth Spenser, he sends Spenser through London, Amsterdam and Montreal in search of justice.<br />In an opening which almost exactly mirrors the start of The Big Sleep, Spenser heads out to rich-suburb Weston to meet with a sad family man in a wheelchair. In this case, the man's family has been blown up as 'collateral damage' by terrorists in London with unknown aims. The man hires Spenser to bring in the 9 responsible, dead or alive.<br />Off Spenser goes, telling his beloved Susan, who he was practically married to in the last book, that he might be gone for months or years. &quot;See ya&quot; says she. He puts out one ad and lounges for a full week before someone answers it. Two thugs try to kill him and he takes them out. When another pair try the following week, Spenser decides to trust his life to Hawk, who was just a casual acquaintance in the previous story. Some pretty strange relationship-altering substances must have been taken between these two stories.<br />On Spenser goes, from Denmark to Amsterdam to Montreal. He barely stops back in the Boston area to keep his benefactor informed and to pop in to see Susan. With an almost implausible twist of fate he tracks down and finds the final head terrorist at the Montreal Olympics and stop an assassination attempt. Oh, and he lets the sex-crazed-nympho female terrorist go, because, of course, she's female. She must not have known any better.<br />In a very unusual situation, there was a made-for-TV version of this which was FAR far better. The female terrorist is a much better character. The whole environment makes much more sense, and there are EXTRA twists that make the story even more interesting. It's pretty amazing when the movie version turns out much better than the book!<br />Let me just add the note that I'm a huge Spenser fan, that I did enjoy reading this as a &quot;historical story&quot; and have read it several times. So it's worth having if you enjoy Spenser. It's just clear that this is an early work of Parker's, before he really hit his stride.njoy Spenser.

He lives out on the Cape with his kids; his wife has run off to New Bedford. It's the first time Hawk shows up in a book - he's just leaving (on a &quot;visit&quot;) when Spenser arrives to talk the next day in Hyannis. He's working for Powers, a loan shark.<br />Turns out both the guy and his wife are in trouble; Spenser cooks up an elaborate plot to entrap the bad guys on each side and rescue the couple. He helps out Hawk, and Hawk helps out him, but they're very &quot;adversarial&quot; although friendly. The couple is very clueless and you have to wonder if they're worth saving -grin-.<br />My Notes: OK, so Spenser starts out talking deeply with Susan, but says he was on the Cape with &quot;Brenda Loring&quot; (what's with these full names?) a few months ago! He ogles the 16 yr old kid of his client. Hawk is a little too &quot;jive&quot; to be cool. But it's interesting to hear he fought along with Hawk 20 years ago and had met in gyms and such since them. They have &quot;mutual respect&quot;. Note that if Spenser is therefore around 40 in this book, that makes him approaching 70 in current stories ... I suppose he has James Bond's immortal powers.<br />Spenser's growing towards suavehood, but isn't quite there yet. I mean, he talks about throwing the kid through the window for being surly! He's not exactly understanding of the women he meets. This is not the Spenser I love -grin-. He at LEAST is drinking Amstel Lights and Heinekens now.<br />Susan's more annoying than helpful; his comments about her are that she told him to sip his beer and such. She still guzzles food and drink. At the end he proposes marriage and she goes &quot;Oh, jeez, I don't think so now. I just wanted you to ask&quot;. But now they're committed to each other forever even though a scant few months ago he was going for weekends with Brenda? Hmmmmm. And even though he's practically all over the woman in the story.

Robert Parker had obviously done his homework well - he wrote his doctoral thesis on the Private Eye genre of writing! An English Professor living in the Boston area, Parker was sure to write a story near and dear to his heart.<br />The plot: an illuminated manuscript is stolen. A student is killed, his girlfriend framed, and a tie to left-wing politics, drugs, and all the rest is involved. The story brings our first look at Joe Broz, but Spenser kills off his only two &quot;muscle men&quot; we meet. We also meet Spenser's two favorite cops - Lt. Quirk and Frank Belson.<br />The story is in &quot;a university&quot; which is studiously unnamed, in Boston by Roxbury. We get the girl's parents on the hill in West Newton, the English Professor on the beach at Marblehead. Lots of talk about the drives between these places. A double murder at Jamaica Pond, a stay at the Boston City Hospital. The final scene takes place at the Copley Plaza hotel.<br />Wow, what a different &quot;Spenser&quot; from the most recent books! Spenser has gone through a DRAMATIC transformation since this first rough-and-dirty portrayal. In many ways, Spenser is just beginning to develop his personality in this story. There's no Susan, no Hawk, no self-assured steadfastness. Spenser drinks a lot, puts himself down, wisecracks a bit too much, and (this is the best part) sleeps with a mother AND her daughter within 24 hours. It was just too much! Oh, quite enjoyable, of course. All the basic Spenser components are there, in a sort of rough form. The plot was good, the people excellent, the descriptive scenery as always lovely.<br />Those who follow Spenser through the series will note that Parker introduced a few ideas here which he later abandoned. Spenser talks about going to games in Boston with his dad as a kid. He actually only came to Boston as a teenager, having grown up in Laramy, Wyoming. Spenser talks about not growing up on a farm. even though he pretty much did. Strangest of all, when he's alone in the house with the sleeping girl, he talks about feeling like his dad did when &quot;all the rest of us&quot; were asleep. The rest of us??? He's an only child! Still, those are minor points in an overall enjoyable beginning to what develops to be a fantastic series.h he pretty much did.

A couple comes to his office and says they never thought of using a Private Eye before; he's bored because he's heard it so many times. Turns out their kid has vanished, taking his guinea pig with him. This is in Smithfield, bastion of the rich up on the north shore. The local police chief is portly and doesn't like Spenser much. So what else is new?<br />One thing is new - Susan Silverman, the High School Guidance Counsellor. She's feisty and beautiful. Their meeting-scene is rather overdone, though. She drinks a lot, which is MUCH different from later stories. He tells of his nose-breaking and she likes his carving of the &quot;Indian on the Horse&quot; (in front of the MFA) which he did in the first book.  She's sad that she's only a guidance counselor and can't really help people. I have a feeling that many guidance counselors out there would have some objection to her point of view. You can make a difference anywhere you are - if only you do your best.<br />Susan becomes a staple to the series, the love-partner of Spenser throughout the books, the one that brings sense to his sometimes frayed world. Unfortunately, at least in this book, she doesn't seem to be helping much. The story is extremely simplistic in dealing with the causes of child unhappiness and the ways in which it can be &quot;fixed&quot;.<br />The story has a good dose of homosexual behavior, drugs and fetishes - all soon to be part of the Spenser trademark plotline. What is EXTREMELY interesting to me is that while the &quot;later&quot; Spenser is very much a hip guy with gay friends and easily defending gay rights, he most definitely did not start out that way. Some of the stereotypes shown here border on insulting.<br />There are other trends forming here. Alcoholic couple, the &quot;artistic&quot; wife is drooling all over Spenser.  Also interesting is the repetition of tennis references (which I didn't think Spenser played), and his reference to the comfort food of the chop suey his mom used to make. His dead mom? State Cop Healey makes his first appearance here.<br />Despite in general being a huge fan of Spenser stories, I hated the ending, but read it and decide for yourself on that one.to the comfort food of the chop suey his mom used to make.

Rachel has received death threats after writing an expose of discrimination in the workplace.<br />You have to remember this is '80 while reading it - Spenser makes several &quot;questionable&quot; comments, and her foes are definitely many and bigoted. Right from the start Spenser has to protect her, although their personalities clash. He tromps all over her while trying to &quot;save her&quot; because of course she can't take care of herself. Rachel fires him, and *poof* she's kidnapped.<br />Spenser finds a bigoted family with some deep conflicts. He traces through a KKK member, some loansharks, gets beaten up and drives in the snow in his 1968 Chevy Convertible. Lucky he didn't try it in Susan's MG. Spenser drinks Becks, Molsons and Asti Spumanti. Rachel, of course, is rescued in dramatic fashion. The book ends with her curled up in Spenser's apartment, holding his hand as she sleeps.<br />My Notes: Well, I suppose even now bigotry exists, maybe I fool myself that it's not as bad as the book makes it out to be. It was pretty nasty for a woman who was just writing books. Spenser, who later has a gay police officer friend, is seriously offensive himself a few times. But I suppose to have him &quot;supporting&quot; a lesbian activist in '80 was a reasonably strong move. He has at various times lobster, shrimp, and oysters, even though he claimed earlier to not like fish.<br />Susan pokes her head in for a scene and *poof* is gone - not much for a woman he swore eternal love to and couldn't live without only a short while ago. As much as Susan can generally be annoying, I like when she and Rachel talk, and Susan is gently helping the Rachel-Spenser interaction go more smoothly. Rachel says &quot;Jeez does Spenser protect you?&quot; and Susan replies &quot;No, we protect each other, sort of how I'm looking out for him now.&quot; Rachel grudgingly admits this is true, and healthy.<br />Interestingly, Susan knows how to cook in this one - onions, peppers, mushrooms. She even makes ham sandwiches (with the ham from Millerton NY, hickory smoked, no nitrates). She must have forgotten soon thereafter. Susan's power is growing - in this story it says &quot;Her interest in people was emanating. One could almost feel it.&quot; It won't be long before the perennial word, &quot;Palpable&quot; shows up!!<br />Spenser is definitely relaxing into his role in the world - I think (bigotry aside) this is the first book that he's really &quot;comfortable with himself&quot; in. He doesn't question his right to do things, he just does them. He punches the picketer. He jumps in when people try to drag her off. He does his job, period. Susan calls him a &quot;Sir Gawain&quot;.<br />It's interesting to hear Rachel bashing Spenser all the time but admit in the end that she needed him to be what he was to rescue her. I wonder if this is a pre-emptive strike at those reviewers who criticize Spenser for being so &quot;macho&quot; - right in the book you have the arguments both ways. Very entertaining. Sadly, no Hawk at all in this one.lthy.<br />Interestingly, Susan knows how to cook in this one - onions, peppers, mushrooms.

He's put on the case by Healey (from &quot;God Save&quot;) and is looking into the Red Sox and trying to figure out if someone's fixing the game. He drinks Miller (argh) and while he talks about &quot;Susan Silverman&quot; he's also seeing &quot;Brenda Loring&quot; (always the full name). Susan's given him a birthday and xmas present so it's been a little while since the last book. <br />Spenser goes out to Illinois and New York on some tracking, but the rest of the story centers around Boston. He confronts a loan shark and his watchdog, asks Lt. Quirk for help. He tries to help out the trapped instead of doing what he was hired to do, which is fun, to watch his moral code develop and strengthen. <br />Very strangely, though, Spenser sets up two people to be killed. Remember, Spenser is the guy who a few years later later won't shoot a truly bad guy who is a mortal threat to him - just because the guy is unarmed and on the floor. For him to be deliberately setting up the death of two guys is a little on the edge of his &quot;morality scale&quot;. He's like a colt growing into a horse - he's at that slightly awkward stage, but you can see the huge potential just around the corner. <br />My thoughts - I like the &quot;inside the action&quot; stories, where you learn about something in detail. It's neat hearing about how baseball works at Fenway, and the locations are all right around Boston. <br />However, it's bizarre that book 2 was so solidly &quot;Susan Silverman&quot; while this one shows Brenda and only mentions Susan in bits until the end. Spenser still drinks heavily as he almost &quot;doubts what he's doing&quot; - he doesn't have the self confidence of later books. He's unsure about confronting the loan shark. He drinks Miller!! He sets up the bad guy so he can kill him. Hmmmmmmm.	2003-07-11

It might be pizza, or mashed potatoes, or other carb-rich foods. Here are ways to make low carb substitutions that are really tasty.<br />The book has 300 recipes, and in hardcover format is a bit hard to keep open and use. So I use this in conjunction with 500 Low Carb Recipes, which is my main cookbook <br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The introduction clearly states that all carb numbers in this book are for CARBS THAT COUNT so they explicitly state that the fiber numbers are ALREADY DEDUCTED. People on Atkins and other diets can rest assured that these numbers are the &quot;real&quot; carbs in each dish.<br />Comfort Foods fills in the gaps with the things you crave. There are lots of bread recipes, pancakes, crepes, mock mashed potatoes, eggplant parmigiana, low carb cheesecake, and much more. There are meals that fit the needs for those on the super-low-carb induction diet, as well as many meals that are great for those on a lifetime maintenance of their health and weight.<br />Since most of what we eat are fresh vegetables and meats, we don't usually need the comfort recipes in this book. But it is DEFINITELY good to have on the shelf, so that if we really decide we want to have pancakes or fresh bread or something &quot;like&quot; mashed potatoes to go with our turkey dinner, the solution is right there, easy to make and healthy too!	2003-07-06

It seemed too good to be true. Choose butter over margarine? Eat tuna steaks instead of bean sprouts and bagels? How could this help you to lose weight?<br />Of course, most of these things have already been proven to be healthy by studies. You can't just drop protein from your diet, and you can't eat tons of starch. Margarine is unhealthy for you, while butter is good. And exercise, of course, is a key to a strong metabolism.<br />I went into college to get a biology degree (I later switched to computer science) so I had a good grounding in biology to start with. And the more I read about this diet, the more intrigued I was. It of course makes sense that the huge volumes of sugar most Americans and other developed nations eat isn't good for us. It makes sense that chowing down on potato chips and french fries isn't healthy. Which is in essence what this diet is all about. Cut out all the sugary junk we have been weaned on. Cut out the bland white bread that has the nutrients beaten out of it. And start eating HEALTHILY.<br />To have a book explain WHY, and how a balanced diet of fresh vegetables, fresh fish and chicken is both filling and nutritious, made a lot of sense to me. Some people erroneously think that Atkins is about lots of bacon and processed meats, and no veggies. Nothing could be further from the truth. Atkins is about salmon steaks and zucchini, lots of fresh salads, tuna and celery. And because your body isn't doing the wild mood swings that sugar consumption bring on, you feel full and relaxed while you do it.<br />Many people make the mistake that the induction plan for the first two weeks is the whole diet. That's not true at all! Induction is to get your body into fat-burning mode. After that, we pretty much ate &quot;normally&quot; - that is, healthily. Lots of fish and chicken, lots of great, fresh veggies, berries and nuts. But cut out all that junk food, and see what a difference it makes.<br />In addition to all the great medical background and step by step instructions, the book even has a selection of delicious recipes and suggestions for those with specific medical problems. This isn't a diet about starvation. We were ALWAYS full on this diet. It's about eating delicious foods like filet mignon and salmon steak, with asparagus and tomato on the side, and having your body thank you by shedding its excess fat it no longer needs.<br />We know so many people that have lost weight (and KEPT it off) on the Atkins diet that it pretty much speaks for itself.

Many of our other low carb recipe books are paperback or hard cover, which are nearly impossible to work with The recipes are well organized and all quite easy to read and follow. <br />But the key here is the VARIETY. A lot of people, raised on the Western &quot;tons of french fries and sugary foods&quot; diet, panic when they think about eating low carb food. Really, all low carb means is that you eat lots of fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and fresh meat! And this is a hardship? Dana's book helps you realize that your menu is now far *tastier* than it ever has been.<br />There are of course the staples - lots of tasty omelet recipes, lots of advice for salads and grilled meats. But then you get into dishes that seem pure paradise. The spicy peanut chicken. The New England boiled dinner. The Eggplant Parmesan. There are pizza crust recipes, shrimp and andouille jambalaya, jerk pork, curried lamb. You could feed someone recipes from this book for 2 years straight, a different dish every night, and they would have no IDEA that this was a &quot;healthy diet&quot;. This stuff is simply *delicious*.<br />And of course there are tons of desserts too, from pumpkin pie to lemon sherbert to peanut butter bars. Sure, some aren't good for the beginning induction stages of an Atkins diet. But a low carb lifestyle can keep you healthy for years and years - and these treats will help keep some variety in your menu. When you've hit your ideal weight, that 10g serving of blackbottomed mockahlua cheesecake might be the perfect way to celebrate! <br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants to eat more healthily - no matter WHAT diet you choose to follow.	2003-07-04

It was a book series I avidly enjoyed while growing up, and its thoughts on enviromentalism and how long, small changes can make a big difference have always stuck with me.<br />This is definitely a book that gets better and better each time you read it. You can read it at age 12 and think it's a great story of a young boy growing up, how he grows and changes and matures as a result of all of the things he goes through. You can read it at 20 and think it's a great book about environmentalism - how changes to a planet and its ecosystem have wide-ranging effects that can be disastrous. And as you continue to read it, you catch all of the subtle nuances - the way people treat each other, how communication and trust can make and destroy lives, how desire for love, desire for power, desire for wealth, desire for knowledge, all shape humans.<br />Some people label this book as 'science fiction' - and it is in the sense that it occurs in a galaxy that has space travel, where technologies unknown to us are in use. But in a grander sense it is about human drama - how humans react to the situations they're in, how their passions drive them, how they think and feel and relate to each other.<br />Yes, there are terms to learn and ideas to understand. This is true whether you're reading a book about the aborigines of Australia or mountain climbing in the Himalayas. It's not something you need to obsess over, constantly checking glossaries. Like in any book, simply read the book from start to end and get absorbed into the culture. The terms will make sense, the personalities will reveal themselves.<br />Some have said the book has characters that are good or evil. I actually find that the MOVIES did this, but the books are extremely good at layering the many shades of grey. People always have motives for what they do and feel that their motives are perfectly justified. Some motives are compassionate, some motives are self serving. Very much like real life.ving.

Written in the 30s, it tells the tale of a young Scottish doctor in the 20s, as he goes from a small-town doctor in a rough situation to a well-paid London doctor with a fancy office.<br />The story's written with intelligence, as the doctor ponders various ways to deal with the bureaucracy he faces. He deals with incompetent doctors, old doctors that have no desire to learn new treatments, young doctors more concerned with money and prestige than patient care.<br />And, as he gets absorbed into the system, the doctor begins to be lured in by the money. He starts to prescribe the 'easy' solution to patients, even if it's not the right answer, so that they're happy and he gets more cash. He does finally realize, in the end, that working for the patients is more important than gaining lots of cash, but only after some hard lessons.<br />I have a few small complaints with the story. One is that the wife could have been a really interesting character, but she's a little flat. She is sad when he becomes money-hungry, and draws back, but that's it. She was a schoolteacher when he met her, and it's made clear that she's very intelligent. But still she just sort of goes along with him, making his meals, wishing things could be better, but far be it for her to actually help out. She tries to get his friends to see him one night to bring back his old ways, but when that fails, &quot;ah well&quot;.<br />My other complaint is that he slides far too easy from a passionate patient-first attitude into a &quot;cash is nice&quot; mentality. But that was necessary for the plot to progress.<br />Definitely a great book to read to learn about life in the 20s to 40s, from the small towns of Wales to the busy streets of London. Interesting details about the damage that mines caused to the lungs of the mineworkers, and the ways that doctors worked with each other and treated their patients. A great read!ead!	2002-08-03

I tracked down this book because my great-grandmother mentioned reading it in her diary in 1941. I thought it would be a period piece, something dated but perhaps interesting. Was I wrong! It was an INCREDIBLY funny and smart book about a teenage girl going through what teenage girls of all eras go through - dealing with boys, getting in and out with the groups of girls, school, parents, and especially an annoying older sister.  The writing is excellent, and each chapter stands alone as sort of a mini-story. This is perfect for any teenage girl in your life, but is also amazingly fun for older women as well!  I've included images of the first three pages so you can get a glimpse of the writing style.	2002-08-03

You get over the initial fear of falling, and learn how to get from the top of the hill down to the bottom. You move from the greens to the blues, and get a sense of what skiing is generally about. But you're not *great*.<br />This plateau is hit by skiiers of all ages and backgrounds. They know the mechanics of skiing, and they know what to do. But they marvel at those people zooming down the slopes effortlessly, as if they were dancing on the snow. <br />The solution is this book. I didn't even buy it on my own originally - it was given to me by a skiier friend who had read it and loved it. The book made a circuit through our skiing group and soon we all had copies of it. We then lent those out to friends, so they could learn too! This wasn't the basics - how to snowplow, how to stop. And it wasn't complicated either. It was full of great, practical, easy to understand *tips* that you could immediately apply to your own skiing.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-03-25

I love the Lord of the Rings series and movie - I've read the books many times since I was young, and have seen the movie several times already. This is a fantastic companion book to both. It gives organized information on each of the main characters, describes some of the key plot elements in the story, and has large, full color photos that aren't found anywhere else. <br />The pictures are great - they show just how much incredible work went into the details on the movie. While other movies use blue-screen and just computer-generate everything, with LotR they fabricated thousands and thousands of items by hand. Every race was thought out - what would an elf fork look like? How about a hobbit pipe? The armor was individually made, the mail shirts constructed from thousands of individual links. Even tiny fragments of parchment on the ground in the Mines of Moria had tiny runes on them. You can see that awesome attention to detail in these photos.<br />One of the best features of the book for me was the great fold-out map in its middle. Far better than the small ones you get in the books! On the downside, they bound the book right through its center, instead of offsetting the map so it could be hung, or at least binding in white space. The result is that Gondor turns into Gndor and Rohan into ohan, and a lot of key features like Moria are lost in that binding. Such a simple thing to have done differently! But other than that gripe, this is definitely a must-have for any fan of the series.	2001-12-28

It then helps you look at the relationship you're in, and with open eyes determine if it's a healthy one for you.<br />The book isn't wishy-washy about this. He says quite openly, &quot;By the way, about the dumbest thing anyone can do is to marry for sex. If sex is the only thing to look forward to in a marriage, don't marry at all. It's not worth it.&quot; That's the tone of a lot of the book - common sense. Don't put up with someone that enjoys insulting you. Don't confuse that rush of hormones in the first few weeks of dating as &quot;true love which will last forever&quot;. With his years of experience, he helps you see common mistakes people make, and how to get through them.<br />He points out that too many of us are raised on quick-fixes these days. Magazines talk about the &quot;27 signs you're in love&quot; - featuring things like &quot;you read his horoscope&quot;. People break off relationships as soon as they get the slightest bit difficult. He instead talks about the ways you really can know if the relationship is good for you, and that it's worth working on and getting to last.<br />Like all books, not every suggestion applies to every person, or to every situation. However, if you're able to read this with an open mind, and accept that your own perceptions might be causing some of the problems in your relationship, he'll help you find ways to change and grow into a more healthy situation.	2001-12-07

Not only are there articles and descriptions, but there are also full color photos, well done maps, diagrams, and graphs as well.<br />The first set of pages talk about wine in general - how it's made, its history, its colors and scents. Then the book dives head-first into the main wine regions. It begins with and dedicates hundreds of pages to France. Every area gets the royal treatment, from the Loire Valley to Champagne to the Rhone. Want to know what the Crus are, or what Chablis is all about? The pictures of the vineyards and maps of the climate help bring the explanations to life.<br />Soon we move on to other European regions - Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal. Eastern Europe, South Africa, and even Asia get their due. However, despite this English edition being released in 2001, there were hardly any pages at all on North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand! These wine regions are very prolific, create many high quality wines, and yet are glossed over. Maybe they simply ran out of binding and couldn't fit in any more pages without going to a second volume. Hopefully this is something they can remedy in the near future.<br />Even so, this is incredibly fun reading for all levels of wine drinkers. The maps and graphics make it easy for newcomers to understand, while the in depth information ensures that even the most experienced of wine drinkers will find something new and fascinating within its pages.	2001-12-05

In this guide, a big-nosed dog helps you through the tasks of understanding and learning about wines. It does its job well!<br />The book begins with the basics - the history of wine, what wine is, and a brief overview of wine and health. Then it moves into section 2 - learning how to taste wine. It talks about the basic moves involved, and then gets into the flavors you will find. It goes into acidity and sweetness, with simple explanations of both. It even goes into what you should NOT taste in a wine, and describes what a 'corked' wine is like. It points out that cork bits floating in your wine do NOT cork it, and that this is perfectly harmless :)<br />Another area tries to explain styles of wine by comparing them to celebrities - from Shirley Temple to Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's an interesting exercise, although not all readers will have seen movies with all of the people mentioned!<br />The book goes in to how to buy wine in stores, how to store it, and how to serve it. It then goes into the main grape varieties, and how each differs from its relatives. And then it gets into the meaty last portion - the region by region reviews. It goes through each - France, Spain, Italy, the US and others - with interesting facts and history, plus recommendations for what to buy and try. It discusses how Chablis should come from France and Port from Portugal, and what to beware.<br />The end area has a glossary of terms, vintage charts and other handy references.<br />While it doesn't give you much information about any one topic, this is a great way for a newcomer to wine to gain a solid grounding!	2001-12-05

Some are the Dummy and KISS type - with little graphics and simple statements to start you from your first baby steps. Other are rich tomes with a wealth of information, like the Oxford Companion to Wine, which Jancis edits. These have just about every term and region you could hope to learn about.<br />This companion to Jancis' TV series is neither of the above, and it is much more. It is Jancis speaking to you, from her richly educated base of knowledge, to help you learn what makes wine so interesting. Think of Jancis as your incredibly experienced aunt, who has just come back from some exotic trip. She and you have sat down in the living room by a fire, are sipping some wine, and she is preparing to regale you with stories, and tidbits, and insights, and fascinating worlds you didn't even imagine.<br />That's what the book is like.<br />It starts with the basics - how to taste, how to serve, how to decant, wine and food. Even in these areas you get the sense that Jancis is chatting with you about something she loves. She admits to decanting full whites not because they need it, but because she loves the glowing color. <br />She goes into the gritty details of how wines are made, what a free-run-wine is, how sparkling and sweet wines are created. And then, she begins in on the regional reviews.<br />France, of course, is first. It always seems to come first. Beautiful pictures of the Chateau Latour tower and Loire valley gables. You move on through Italy, Spain, and yes, the US and Australia get a mention in here too. The reviews are all written from her heart - you see clearly what she likes and doesn't like, and you learn why.<br />A great way to learn more about wine - especially if you're also able to watch the TV Series!	2001-12-05

This is one of those! Not only that, but it actually is handy for birders, in a practical way.<br />Whether you like or don't like squirrels, you have to account for them when you're trying to feed birds. Otherwise your birds end up with no food and you have many fat squirrels running around. This book gives you ways to handle this situation whether you mind the squirrels, or just want them to be in their own area.<br />It rates various feeders, complete with photos, showing you the drawbacks and benefits of each one. It talks about different kids of food, and different ways you can work with them to make them bird-only. It gives you ways to distract the squirrels. And it's REALLY funny!<br />A must-buy for any birder on your present list, and tuck one into your own stocking, too.	2001-11-12

We teach girls that they can cry when they're sad, talk about their feelings, and share experiences with each other. We teach boys that they need to 'buck up' and be manly, to hide the tears, to face it like a man, to be the rock on which the females can rely. It is no surprise that these lessons affect adults, and affect how male and females relate (or fail to relate) to each other.<br />In essence, a few core themes run through the book, being supported by various examples, and different wording that help make the points clear.<br />First, men are goal-oriented, internalizing, and when they are stressed, &quot;retreat to a cave&quot; to consider what to do. They want to come to a solution on their own, and *then* emerge. To try to help them while they are in the &quot;cave&quot; is counter productive.<br />Men want to be trusted and admired. This is the whole Knight-in-Armor, John Wayne, Rambo training we have given men. They want to feel that the woman believes in them. To question a man is to show your doubt. The book recommends if your man is lost while driving, or forgets something while travelling, to just be quiet and accept it. It will show your trust in him to get there eventually or to solve the problem. I'm personally not sure if tihs is always wise advice.<br />Women, on the other hand, are nurturing, expressive, feeling individuals who tend to use poetic license such as saying &quot;you ALWAYS forget to do that chore&quot; or &quot;you NEVER listen to me&quot;. The advice given to men is to take what women say with a grain of salt, and not to react to any of it literally. Most of what women want, according to the book, is just to be heard. Women don't want solutions or answers. They want to feel that their feelings are being heard and understood ... they want to be held and be told &quot;Yes, yes, I understand&quot;. The book explains that men make the mistake of thinking women tell them things in order for the men to *fix* those things. Instead, the women tell them things in order to share their feelings, but aren't seeking actual resolutions.<br />While I agree that women are trained to share feelings and to sometimes be overly emotional, to tell a man that women never want resolutions, and always exaggerate, is not treating a woman as a logical human being perfectly capable of wanting answers.<br />There is definitely a lot of helpful information in the book. It is of course good to show trust in your husband. It is important to understand what your wife *means* and not just pick apart what she literally has *said*. It is good to understand that society trains men to &quot;retreat&quot; to consider problems, and that they consider interference during this time as &quot;harassment&quot; instead of &quot;helpful&quot;. It's good to realize that women have emotional cycles and can sometimes be happy, and sometimes sad, and that nobody is always happy.<br />However, be sure to read the book as a guideline on how to help your relationship, and not as a Bible which has the exact ways in which you and your special partner can relate to each other. It definitely has interesting hints and tips, and interesting stories to share. It also has many generalizations that, for many individuals, simply do not apply.istake of thinking women tell them things in order for the men to *fix* those things.

None of the ideas presented are of mind-boggling compexity. One tip is to whisper to someone at the library. Another is to only *glance* at your flirtee instead of staring at them. Yet another is to watch body language - watch to see if the person you're talking to is sitting stiffly with arms crossed. Hopefully most people who talk to other people have figured some of this stuff out :)<br />Still, there are good tips hidden in here. For example, when a man is flirting with a woman at a party and they are walking along, the man can gently take the arm of the woman to help guide her through the crowd. This is sort of a 'here, I'll help you out' and also a 'I'm interested in you' combo move which I always find quite appealing. <br />It gives tips about how to talk with the person you're flirting with - asking open ended questions that need more than a yes/no answer. Discussing things in a way that you only say a sentence or two yourself, so that the other person is drawn into the conversation. <br />It even gives a few tips on breaking up or opting out of a situation cleanly, if you end up with someone that you decide isn't quite right for you.<br />While this isn't an in depth study of relationships, and definitely not a guide to dating or marriage, it certainly offers decent tips on how to become an accomplished flirt. Check it out, and see if you learn a thing or two!	2001-08-09

When I get the latest book, I grab it and make the few hours of time it takes to read it - something I rarely do for any other book. I'll relish the puns and savor the literary thrill of it all. Unfortunately, though, the plots seem to get weaker each year.<br />I hate to give away what happens - I don't even read the jackets of the books. However, this one could be guessed at without any specific clues. Spenser is approached by a woman in trouble. He and Hawk go out to assist her. It's Not As It Seems. Spenser is bullied and refuses to back down. He tries to protect the woman.  People lie to him. Other people who &quot;should&quot; be bad are honest to him. Women want to sleep with him. There's a big confrontation and things are resolved the Spenser Way.<br />I love this writing so much that it's almost painful to see the way the plot unfolds. The way this one ends is especially disappointing. Again, I don't wish to give it away, but if the males had been female and the females male, I think the reaction would have been completely opposite. Being female, this bothers me a lot. Adults should be treated with equal weight and responsibility whether they're female or male, and Spenser seems to feel that it's OK for women to do whatever they want to because &quot;they're just women&quot;.  I'm sure Susan would have something to say about that ...<br />If you love Spenser, definitely get the book. It's a great read, and you get to meet a bunch of his favorite partners all in one group. Reading about their interactions is priceless. Read it as a character study, and not as an actual story with a destination. If you start questioning the results, you might be disappointed.	2001-04-17

I can't imagine any couple that couldn't learn a few things by reading through this.

Things like 'learn to waltz' or 'share your fantasies' are very common. It's definitely valuable to just read through casually and see if anything stands out, but most of it is so pedestrian as to be completely silly.<br />We spent three entire meals when we first got the book sitting around the table with our 12 year old son, reading the various tips aloud to each other. At one point we were laughing so hard at the thought that these were &quot;helpful tips&quot; that my son snorted milk out his nose! C'mon, tips to share your umbrella when it's raining? What, you're going to let your girlfriend or boyfriend get soaking while you huddle under your own? Tips to let your lover in when he's locked outside?? Yikes :)<br />At least 20% of the tips seemed to do with speaking in a &quot;romantic&quot; French accent, giving breakfast in bed, giving flowers or saving flowers, and love notes. We decided that if you gave your true love a breakfast in bed with a rose on the tray, a love note by the rose, and spoke to her in a French accent that it would just overwhelm her and she'd faint dead away :)<br />A fun book to have around, but not terribly helpful for practical advice.	2001-02-15

It goes through each step a winemaker follows, from the equipment to the yeast, from fining to fermenting. <br />It would have been helpful to have more photos and high quality illustrations in the book - you are restricted to simple line drawings when reading about the various things going on in the description. Usually they suffice, though, and you can figure out what to do.<br />This might not be the best 'only one' book for an all-around winemaker - it concentrates on making wine from grapes, while most home winemakers foray extensively into fruit winemaking.

They have been overlooked for far too long.<br />Unfortunately, it's hard to have any book keep up with the changes in this industry, and the third edition came out with incorrect information that they hadn't changed from the second edition. I might grab this if you don't know anything at all about the region, but you should always check the individual wineries' websites for actual offerings, hours of operation, and current ratings by the Wine Spectator.	2001-01-23

It covers everything from Alcaeus (&quot;The best medicine is wine&quot;) to Leonard Bernstein (&quot;Wine snobbery, of course, is part showmanship, part sophistication, part knowledge and part bluff.&quot;)<br />In fact, be sure to grab yourself a copy too.

It does have great information - a breakdown of wines by region, then for each region it gives the main types of wine and the vintages that are good for each type. A general star rating indicates how well this wine does in general. Next to each region is a list of the key producers of that wine, with a brief note about the producer.<br />I think, though, that this will be relatively difficult for a person new to wine to use. If you're looking at a Ruffino Chianti, you look up Ruffino. Its brief notes about Ruffino don't indicate if this is a good or bad winery. You then move to the Chianti section and find out what a Chianti is, but now you are given general notes about which years are good. The years are just listed - you can't tell which are better than others.<br />If the book had even a general rating for each winery, and more details about the vintages, I think this would be excellent. Maybe a future edition will include this information.	2001-01-23

Take the first section on why wines 'taste' differently, based on their aroma. Heidi suggests you try comparing an apple piece to a pear piece with your nose being held. Most people can't tell them apart, because the tongue only tastes basic flavors. The rest comes from your nose.<br />Heidi further explains how wines can be broken down into pretty basic styles based on tannin, acid, sweetness and alcohol levels. She explains how to run simple taste tests with tea, sugar, lemon juice, and cream to see these differences. Have you felt that you could never understand these &quot;fine distinctions?&quot; Her tests will show you how easy it is, once you know what to look for!<br />Other sections include how to run a wine tasting, what the various wine varieties taste like, ways to learn how to be better at tasting wines, pairing food and wine, and even how to select wines in stores and in restaurants.<br />At 110 pages this is a relatively quick read, and the information is well written and helpful. If you're looking to increase your basic knowledge about wine, this might be a place to start!	2001-01-03

I was very disappointed, however, when I grabbed this book to entertain myself for an evening.  The stories themselves are relatively interesting, but when it comes down to figuring out whatever the question is, their conclusions are at time questionable and in some cases downright wrong.  The leaps of logic they make to deduce their answers are simply not reasonable. I'd bypass this one and look to some of the other offerings out there.	2001-01-03

This is by far one of my favorites. The book begins with an overview of the warrior culture in Japan, reviewing the eight points of Bushido (the Way of the Warrior) and the periods in Japanese history. <br />It then begins with photos and descriptions of early history armor and weapons, back in the 800s when Japan was just forming its culture. It then moves into the more and more elaborate outfits and armor, with drawings, photos and historical illustrations explaining how the items were put on and used. <br />The helmet and armor photos are simply gorgeous, with all details showing up clearly and then described in full detail. I could look at the photos of the swords and tsuba, or guards, for quite a while. The glossary at the back helps explain any terms with which you are unfamiliar.<br />Highly recommended for any fan of this fascinating culture.	2000-12-09

Each bird is shown in several poses, with the map right on the same page, and information on the size, song, movement, and other details. <br />The birds of a type are also shown side by side, making it easy to glance through a group of pictures to determine which one you have seen. Birds are shown in flight with wings both up and down, helping identify flying birds.<br />On the downside, this book is fairly large and not a pocket-portable variety. This is a great book to have on the table for reference, and to look through by the fire, but wouldn't be one you carry out with you hiking. The maps are also a bit on the small side, but they do give you a general impression of where the birds are found.<br />A great book for a birder who already has a small pocket-guide, but wants something more substantial for the tricker identifications. Also great for casual reading!	2000-12-06

It's an incredibly well written piece of literature that addresses political, social, environmental, and religious issues in a way that is enthralling and immediate. It's a book that you can pick up at any stage of your life and find something that speaks to you, and something that profoundly affects you.<br />On one level, it is a political story. Alliances change, traitors bring down great houses, there are plans within plans within plans. It can almost read like a mystery novel, as you figure out why someone did something seemingly illogical, which actually furthered their own interests.<br />On another level it's a story about the things humans hold most dear. The spice, melange, grants some great powers, others long live, and others great wealth. Who should control the spice, how should it be used, how should people profit off of it?<br />This is a story about environmental consequences and the interrelatedness of all things. Dune is a desert planet, where even spit is valuable because of its water content. The scorn of the ruthless holders of the planet for this valuable commodity clashes with the care and concern the natives have for preserving every drop. <br />It's even a story about human relationships. The lead character's mother and father never marry, so that the father might be open to a political alliance. Despite this, they are deeply in love with each other. The son finds himself in the same situation, in love with one woman but for political reasons forced to consider an &quot;alliance of reason&quot; with another. How do these situations affect people?<br />I played in a DuneMUSH for years - a role playing environment where we based characters and plots on the Dune universe. The characters, situations, and plots that Herbert laid out were so well done and complex that it supported hundreds of players through months and months of gameplay without any flagging of interest, and indeed many playersfound their outlook on life changed by exploring more and more deeply into why this world worked the way it did.<br />Highly, highly recommended.	2000-12-05

(Classic Seuss)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A true classic for readers of all ages	Dr. Seuss is a brilliant storyteller who got into writing childrens books hoping to give kids something &quot;fun&quot; to read. At the time, most children only had options like &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; ... nothing that captured the imagination. The Grinch certainly was a fresh, exciting change!<br />A classic that many associate easily with the holiday season, the Grinch is a mean-hearted grouch that simply hates everything about caring, and giving, and sharing. He sets forth to destroy the holidays for the delightfully innocent Whos in Who-ville. <br />His plans are brought to a crashing halt when he realizes that the Whos do not care about the presents and trapings he stole - they are joyfully happy because they have each other, and they have the celebration of the day. This knowledge converts the Grinch into a kinder, gentler creature.<br />It's really a powerful message for just about anyone in this commercial age - that in the end it's not the boxes and shiny paper under the tree, it's the joy and happiness of being together and sharing this special season. Best of all, this message isn't given in an overbearing manner. It's done in an extremely lighthearted, open and joyous storytelling with GORGEOUS graphics and a deft touch.<br />I loved this book as a child, and I love it even more as an adult, reading it to my own child. Grab yourself a copy or two, and give it out to friends. You'd be surprised how much meaning this simple book still holds.	2000-12-05

It is a fascinating story of changes in morality, of perceptions of wine and the world around us, and how an entire nation moved back and forth on its thoughts about food, culture, wine, and much more.<br />The story begins back with Jefferson, who in the late 1700s was a huge proponent of wine. He tried unsuccessfully to grow his own vines, and promoted European winedrinking at the white house and in his circles of friends. In 1803 winemaking really begins with Nicholas Longworth in Ohio, with sweet whites.<br />In the 1850s a huge temperance movement began, and in the 1860s rot came in and destroyed practically all of the vines. At the same time, phylloxera hit heavily in Europe, destroying vines there. It wasn't until the 1870s that solutions began to be implemented for both of these situations ... but by the 1890s there was once again a boom in planting. At the 1900 Paris Expo, 40 American wineries won awards. Wine was on its way up.<br />Or so people thought. Shortly, the guillotine descended. The death knell for most wineries came with Prohibition in 1917.<br />Ironically, prohibition resulted in more people drinking to get a buzz, and fewer drinking it reasonably with meals. Home winemaking was legal, so the vineyards that remained open did so by selling &quot;pretty&quot; grapes to this market. These were usually bad for actual winemaking, and the home winemakers worked on making sweet, fortified wines for maximum results and to overwhelm the taste. By the time prohibition ended in 1933, the US winery count had dropped from over 1000 down to 150. Some states stayed dry long after this - Mississippi was the last state to allow alcohol, in 1966.<br />It was in the late 60s that wine consumption began to rise again - food quality was increasing, people were appreciating more and more foods, and the food they made was able to pair well with wines. At the same time, wine quality was ever increasing. In a famous blind tasting in Paris in 1976, a Stag's Leap 1973 Cabernet and a Chateau Montelena 1973 Chardonnay were rated the top two wines - over two top French wines. Not only that, but the wine tasters consistantly made comments that this one was 'obviously French' or that one was a 'pedestrian American' and were wrong almost every time.<br />A mere quarter century later, we have fantastic wines being created in just about every state in America, winery tours are booming business, Americans are drinking more and more wine, and the book charts the entire route. The people, events, and situations are richly described, and catch you up in the story.<br />The book is simply fascinating in many, many ways.

They both believe they saw something traumatic, but find that item after item in their recollections did not actually happen. I've run a feudal Japan newsletter for over 10 years, so my main interest in this story was with the Japanese samurai tradition covered, as well as the bodyguard ethics.<br />The main teller of the story is American, but his counterpart is Japanese, and there are many interesting aspects to his personality and background. Part of the story takes place in Japan, in various areas of both city and country. The bodyguard was trained by a skilled ninja-type (of course) and the descriptions of their fighting style are also intriguing.<br />The narrative examines the background of Japan as the plot wends its way here and there. Readers learn various stories such as the 47 ronin, and backgrounds of the tea ceremony, zen gardening, bushido, and more.<br />While this book is not really meant to teach about Japan, the writer did a good job of researching his topic and slips much of the information in as casual background to the story.<br />If you can accept some of the plot holes at the end of the story, and don't worry very much about details that do not quite match up, this is a very enjoyable book!	2000-11-03

We eat Indian out quite a bit, and I am hooked on palak paneer, aloo gobi, pakoras, samosas, garlic naan, you name it. We were always a bit afraid to start cooking it in our home, though, because there are so many spices and often hours of cooking involved in these dishes. Then we came across Madhur Jaffrey and her series of books.<br />They are superb!! This one in particular is a staple of our cookbook selection. The first part of the book goes over the spices involved and the different techniques used in cooking, to give you an overview. It even describes the types of equipment you should have. Then ... the recipes!!<br />All of my favorites are in here. Naan, which we cook on a pizza stone. Saag aloo. Aloo ghosht. You just open the book to any page and you hit a delicious dish. There's beef and chicken, completely vegetarian, even a whole section on relishes and chutneys. <br />If I had any complaint it would be that there aren't many pictures at all in here, but the recipes come out so well, and the descriptions are so complete that you rarely need to know what it looks like.

There are countless names of wines, some indicating the grape used, some the place, some both. A Chardonnay is a wine made from that grape, unless it's being used in a region of France, in which case it's called Chablis. Some wine is ready to drink when you buy it, but others need 10-20 years of aging. The bottle doesn't have a &quot;drink by&quot; date on it!

It goes into tasting wine - how to best get the flavors out of a wine, and how to describe the wine to others in a way they might understand.<br />Next the various terms are discussed - blending, filtering, and so on. Grapes are described, with descriptions of how they have different flavors depending on where they are planted. Notes describe how organic farming, sulfites, and tannins are involved in grape-growing.<br />One section goes in depth into the whole wine-naming dilemma, describing various place names and what grapes are used there. Another section goes step-by-step through the normal process of ordering wine in a restaurant, and dealing with the waiter's presentation.<br />The language of labels is described, from Californian labels where usually the grape name and winery name are important, to European wines where typically the location and year are prominent. Varieties of labels are described, with notes on what to watch for.<br />The manual goes into each wine making region - France, Italy, Spain, the US, and many others - describing what wines are typical there, what makes the region unique, what to watch for.

Or do you have a wine snob friend who you want to tease a bit? If so, then the &quot;Bluff your way in wine&quot; book is for you. Written by an expert who has a long history of real wine knowledge, the book is accurate, but lighthearted and fun.<br />The book is geared not towards truly educating you on fine wines, but instead giving you the code words and key behaviors of a narrow-minded &quot;wine snob&quot;. It's sort of like an etiquette manual for an Archie Bunker wannabe, for someone who wants to spend time with him and not say the &quot;wrong thing&quot;.<br />To start with, the book is only 55 small pages, if you don't count the table of contents and glossary. The book is geared towards someone who doesn't have to remember details, and just wants the basics to survive a cocktail party full of &quot;only my way&quot; winos.<br />For example, the book says there are three types of wine - red, white, and rose &quot;which is to be avoided&quot;. Some wine lovers might point out that there are many rose wines of value, but certainly, if a reader of this book turned his or her nose up at any White Zinfandel, many wine snobs would applaud this behavior.<br />One of my favorite sections describes the use of decanters. Apparently &quot;the aim is to make the performance resemble a Black Mass.&quot; The candle is used &quot;to induce ceremonial atmosphere.&quot;<br />The book goes over the basics of wine tasting, and how to describe a wine, all in a light-hearted, humorous fashion. Keep in mind, though, that the book is made for wine snobs, and not wine lovers. For example, the section on Chardonnay says, &quot;The world's No. 1 white grape, it also tends to taste roughly the same wherever it is grown.&quot; Any Chardonnay fan will tell you this is far from the truth.<br />The ending section of the book, on key producers and winemaking regions, is also in need of an update. The glossary is full of interesting asides - the description for &quot;vin de table&quot; reads, &quot;wine which will drink you under the table.&quot;<br />A fine book for lighthearted reading, or for a prank for a wine snob.

This rice wine has been around for thousands of years, and is part of many traditions in Japan. As Japanese food styles have become popular across the globe, so has this fine drink, which can be served both warm and cold. To learn more about the history of sake, and to learn how to choose a good brand, this book is invaluable.<br />To start with, The Sake Handbook goes over each step involved in making sake. Reading through the intricate processes involved helps you understand why there are so many varieties of sake, and why each one has a different flavor. One key step, for example, is the polishing step. The inner part of the rice generally is of higher quality than the outer portion, so the more 'extra' that is polished away, the finer the sake.<br />Next, Gauntner goes over the various types of sake, and how each is unique. Some of these terms are:<br />* Junmai-shu is pure rice sake. Only rice, water, and the koji mold are used to produce this top level sake. It ends up tasting heavier and fuller than other types of sake. It uses less than 70% polished rice - this means they have `ground away' the other 30% of impurities.<br />* Honjozo-shu has a small amount of distilled ethyl alcohol added during the final stages. They then add water later so the alcohol content stays the same. This sake is lighter and dryer than other types. It can be served warm.<br />* Ginjo-shu uses 60% polished rice. It is also fermented for longer periods of time, giving a complex and delicate flavor.<br />* Daiginjo-shu is just like Ginjo-shu, but polished to 50% of the original size. It takes even longer to brew and complete.  Futsuu-shu - any sake which does not fall into one of the above four categories.<br />Gauntner describes how sake is tasted, and how an individual can learn to distinguish between various sakes, and figure out the 'type' best suited for his or her palate. To help with this, the entire second half of the book is dedicated to a brand-by-brand evaluation of the best sakes on the market. This is invaluable! No matter if you're in Tokyo or Chicago, you can bring this book in with you to a store or restaurant and compare with ease the various sakes available.<br />There even is a section towards the back listing the best sake restaurants in Japan.

That's where &quot;Champagne&quot; comes in! <br />This book begins with the geology of the Champagne region, located northeast of Paris. It describes the chalk beds and limestone that forms the basis of the soil, and how these conditions are perfect for the grapes that make up Champagne. <br />Next, &quot;Champagne&quot; goes into the early history of the region, describing the various groups that fought over the soil, explaining how the conversion to Christianity of its early holders led to foundations of monastaries. These monastaries becames the curators of the vineyards, developing vineyard techniques and blending systems. <br />The important developments necessary for a sparkling wine are covered - the thicker bottles, the cork to seal the bottle, and of course Dom Perignon, the blind monk whose keen palate and in depth knowledge led to the beginning of a reputation for this region. <br />The laws over the years are covered in depth, with histories of the regulations given. The book describes purning systems and vineyard techniques, explaining how the grapes are grown. It lists the famous &quot;Champagne widows&quot; who furthered the cause of many wineries here. <br />The appendices list the members of the Union of Wine Producers, gives the Bollinger Charter of ethics and Quality, describes the seven orders in Champagne, provides a vintage chart, and gives a full list of all premiere crus. <br />This would definitely be the book for someone who has already gone through the &quot;introduction to Champagne&quot; books, and now wants an in depth history of the region, its geology, its policital background and legislative situations.	2000-10-26

The text and graphics help make the ins and outs of Champagne clear to anyone interested in this fun, bubbly drink.<br />The book goes through a background of the drink, the history and legends, and then settles into the meaty material. It gives an overview of the four regions of Champagne - Montagne de Reims, Cote des Blancs, Vallee de la Marne, and the Aube (or Cote des Bar). It describes how the vineyards are classified by quality. Unlike some other regions, the last classification was done as recently as 1985. There are 17 Grand Cru vineyards and 40 Premiere Crus. Most wineries use grapes from a variety of vineyards; only the smaller wineries can typically claim to have grapes from only Grand Cru or Premiere Cru vineyards.<br />&quot;Champagne for Dummies&quot; goes deeply into what Mr. McCarthy has selected as the top 25 Champagne houses. This section is so detailed that it is broken into two chapters. Each house is described fully, with notes on the history of the house, current situation, and best buys to watch for.<br />The book describes what other growers, cooperatives, and organizations exist in the world of Champagne. It goes over the role each plays in getting the Champagne into the hands of the consumer.<br />Then the all important hands-on information is given. Be sure to buy Champagne from a shop with quick sales, so you can get the wine fresh. This helps ensure it has not suffered heat problems while waiting for your purchase. Buy from a temperature controlled shop, and don't buy at the end of the summer, where the wine was delivered and held during the hotter months. Also, don't store your wine in the fridge for more than a few weeks. This can harm Champagne, or any wine for that matter.<br />Champagne should be served in narrow flute glasses, at around 45 - 48F. It goes well with shellfish, oysters, and with light cheeses.<br />Information is given on visiting the Champagne region of France, giving advice on where to stay and where to eat. At the end, some details are given on non-French sparkling wines - the sparklers from California and Australia, Asti from Italy, and Cava from Spain. The book ends with a directory of Champagne wineries, a vintage chart, and glossary.<br />I enjoy the Wine Dummies series a great deal.

This handy guide to the ins and outs of Champagne is a must for anyone throwing a Champagne tasting, or having a party where they want to talk about this drink of celebrations. <br />First, the book is a pleasure to read. The lovely hand-drawn photos of grapes in baskets and vineyards go well with the calligraphy in the background. This is something to read by a window overlooking a garden, with of course a glass of Champagne in hand. <br />Ms. Zraly is well versed in her subject. She worked with the various Champagne firms for over twelve years, and it shows. She first goes through the history of Champagne, explains how only wines from Champagne France should be given that name, and goes through how the 35,000 hectares of land are strictly watched over. <br />The grapes in Champagne are typically Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier. The book goes through vintages, cuvees, and other terms. It lists the typical progress of a Champagne vineyard month by month. There are vintage charts, label reading instructions, fun quotes. And then there's more! <br />A series of delicious Champagne recipes help you further enjoy this fine bubbly, from the Champagne Lady's own files, from the owner of Spago, and many other luminaries. The book goes on to give party suggestions - how to plan a brunch, a cocktail party, a baby shower, you name it. It describes how to open Chamagne, and how it should be opened for you in a restaurant. There is even information on which houses make the most Champagne and what to do with the empty bottles! <br />A fine reference source and fun read for anyone interested Champagne - the sparkling wine that is present at most celebrations around the world.	2000-10-26

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A classic that's great for all ages	I remember when I first began reading the Hobbit, when I was 7 or 8, absorbed immediately by the young, innocent hobbits. Like me, they were drawn into a world with strange races, people of every shape and size, all with their own hopes and desires, languages and cultures. I was hooked.<br />I've reread the series many, many times since then, and have had the joy of seeing my own son become completely enamored with it. I still name characters 'Aragorn' when I play computer games, because he became such a symbol to me of honesty, integrity, perseverence against all odds. Some girls dreamt of handsome princes. I dreamt of a man who, while not 'fair of face', was the protector of innocents, the defender, the one who strove and fought without reward.<br />In a world where so many books are full of sex, gratuitious violence, disrespect, infidelity, etc. etc., it is amazing to go back to this book that was researched to the Nth degree and promotes that honesty and justice, after hard work and effort, does finally win out in the end. <br />It's not a sugar-coated book, though. There are betrayals, there are sad scenes and suffering. If anything, the book does a great job to show that no matter what someone looks like, or where they come from, they have the same basic longings and needs. If someone comes to think that dwarves and elves and hobbits and such are all able to work together, then our silly concerns about 'shades of grey' in humans' skins seem amazingly shallow.<br />If you haven't read this yet, please do. It is one of the best written and thoroughly researched books of the past few centuries. JRR developed whole cultures for his characters, and that depth really shows. His writing style is amazing. The epic leaves you wishing he wrote a 9-parter instead of the works he did. Still, even what we have is more than enough to keep me re-reading ...	2000-10-21

This is a book we all agree on, regardless of which kind of machine we use. <br />The opening section has information on types of bread machines and conversion tables to figure out how to adjust a recipe, if you need to. This makes the book useful regardless of which machine you use. It also lists various problems people tend to have when using bread machines, and lists ways to fix each one.<br />The recipes are delicious! My copy of the book has a permanent crease on the Italian Bread recipe, which I make all the time. It lists a nutritional analysis for each recipe, so you know exactly how many calories, sodium, fat, etc. are in the bread. There are cheese breads, herb breads, oat breads, sourdough, you name it.<br />If you're looking into a bread machine, or have one already, be sure to get this book!	2000-10-17

I have always had a Betty Crocker cookbook around. It was the first cookbook I took with me when I moved away from home, and it still remains the first book I grab for if I have *any* questions about a recipe I'm making.<br />The book is great for cooks of all levels. It has a lot of great introductory information - how do you boil an egg? What are the different cuts of meat? It provides a lot of easy recipes that taste delicious and are nutritious as well.<br />In addition, the book also eases you into many advanced recipes. Looking to cook a Thanksgiving dinner for the relatives? Trying to make a birthday dinner really special? This cookbook has the recipes for you, all easy to understand and with gorgeous photos.<br />This version is definitely an improvement on previous versions as well. There is information on grilling and vegetarian meals, something lacking in the last versions. They've also added in a number of ethnic dishes that are quite tasty.<br />If this book isn't on your kitchen shelf, be sure to buy a copy!	2000-10-17

The Third Edition is definitely a large step forward, based on the experience of thousands of RPers. The Player's Handbook in particular is incredible useful both for brand new gamers as well as experienced RPers looking for an updated rule set.<br />The artwork and layout of this book is FANTASTIC. It's amazing to compare this with some of the earliest books and realize how far things have come. The rich colors, great illustrations, easy to understand tables ... everything was done with the highest level of quality.<br />The rules themselves have been streamlined to the point where the game is easy, fun, consistant, and realistic. No more arbitrary rules 'just because'! Characters can now be customized and gameplay is very balanced.<br />Even level advancement and spells have been overhauled to give more options and to keep things simple. <br />As an additional bonus, the book comes with a demo version of a character generator! There are also a Character Record sheet to copy and use, a glossary, equipment charts, and much, much more.<br />I recommend this without hesitation to any gamer out there. If you can, buy a copy for yourself today. If you don't have the money, put it on your wish list for the holidays!	2000-10-17

The Third Edition is definitely a large step forward, based on the experience of thousands and thousands of RPers over the years. The Monster Manual is a huge part of this new set, and is a must-buy for any gamer.<br />The manual contains the standards from previous D&amp;D games, as well as quite a few new and interesting monsters. Most DMs start with the manual and then develop their own particular styles of monsters based on their campaign, and this book makes a great launching point for that imaginative play.<br />The writing is great, and the artwork is simply fantastic. This is a definite present for any gamer on your holiday list, or if you're a gamer yourself, simply buy yourself a copy - why wait!	2000-10-17

My personal favorite is the Sweet Oatmeal Bread. They also have recipes for herb breads, rye, pumpernickel, rolls, and much more. <br />The recipes are all delicious, and work wonderfully. A lot of work must have been done testing and perfecting each one. With separate recipes for 1 and 1 1/2 pound loaves, this book should work well with whatever bread machine you use.<br />Definitely grab a copy and begin experimenting!	2000-10-17

It doesn't get bogged down in long technical descriptions and pages of history. Instead, with sections like &quot;Problems in the South&quot;, it gets right into what will and will not work for your home winemaking efforts.<br />The intro has a glossary of terms and a basic overview of winemaking which is very helpful for those new to the fun. Tables list which kinds of grapes work best for different regions, so those who are planting vines have a best-case scenario laid out for them. Clear instructions tell how to plant the vines, how to prune them, what a trellis looks like, and even harvest details.<br />That's just to start. Now the books goes into the winemaking process, and it shines here as well. The conversational tone makes it easy to follow discussions of pH and brix and pomace. The book offers various normal situations winemakers find themselves in, and solutions to fix them. There is even information on barrel usage and aging techniques. <br />The back appendix section offers places to buy wine supplies, wine societies, common vine pests and treatment, and much more.<br />In all, this is a fantastic resource for the home vine grower and winemaker. Grab a copy if you're either one!	2000-10-17

That makes it very difficult for me to understand how he can fail in his two Sunny Randall stories. The first one was pretty bad. If possible, this one is even worse.<br />Sunny is a short blonde PI whose ex-hubby's family are into crime. She has a female shrink pal (a la Susan), a tough male friend (a la Hawk) and just about the same contacts as Spenser does. I could forgive all that. It's the way Parker writes female characters that really irks me, and the inane plots he puts her through.<br />Let's see. In the first chapter Sunny's sister is berating crazy Jew shrinks (hmmmmmm) and she manages to catch the sis' hubby cheating the very first day, the very first time. Not only that, but plot flaws give her omniscient powers at times. We can forgive those, perhaps they were sly comments on womanhood and the Spenser history.<br />Sunny finds it strange that a woman who is researching prostitutes would talk to a vice cop. We have the whole &quot;Oh, I love you but I can't live with you, isn't this perfect&quot; situation. We have the old &quot;I caught you and now must decide what is morally correct to do about it&quot; situation. This starts to get tedious.<br />Two of the women she deals with need men in different ways - one to take care of her and one for pleasure. Another doesn't like her home situation and decides to run around with men instead. Sunny doesn't want to turn to men, but in the end ends up completely turning to men to both get to talk to someone and then to fall in their arms and cry afterwards! For a book that you would hope promotes a female's ability to be an individual, it falls flat on its face.<br />The plot had so much potential. There were mixed sexualities, mixed races, mixed relationships, you name it. I kept hoping for something to shine through, but it didn't. Sunny kept telling everyone that they were in a 'crazy time' and that they shouldn't do anything permanent until they got through it. I can only hope that Parker will concentrate on Spenser from now on, and give us the fantastic writing he is so well known for.til they got through it. I can only hope that Parker will concentrate on Spenser from now on, and give us the fantastic writing he is so well known for.	2000-10-10
US	52759271	R1UKN9YJLD66AJ	0425152901	562550979	Thin Air (Spenser)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	OK book, much better as the A&amp;E tv movie	I read this long before I saw the TV version, but I have to say it's much easier to handle this as a movie. Hawk is off somewhere while Spenser tries to track down Belson's lost wife. She of course has been abducted by someone addicted to her. Spenser of course has to barge in and rescue her, with the help of Chollo.<br />The book was written from two sides - Lisa's and Spenser's. The back and forth was not always smooth, which is why the live version worked better. Chollo, from California, was actually a fun replacement for Hawk - he brought his own style of wisecracking and humor. Susan's become quite tolerable at this point, which can only be a good thing.<br />I've actually driven past this area of Massachusetts, tho I didn't feel like driving into it to find the buildings mentioned :). Parker definitely gets the feeling for the kind of poverty the people live in, and the situations that result from it.<br />A bit campy at times, but the writing is as always gorgeous, and many of the issues touched on are handled quite well.	2000-10-03

Usually I read Spenser for the great writing style and Boston area environment. This book has in addition great descriptions of Vegas, that City of Sin, and some behind the scenes gangster family situations. It's all handled quite well, and the characters truly get you involved in the action.<br />It's not just a lost-girl-Spenser-finds-girl situation. There are a lot of plot twists, a lot of tracking and figuring out who double-crossed who, and why, and what he should do. Spenser figures out pretty quickly the basics of what's going on. However, it takes him longer to figure out the morally correct thing to do about it, and it's this side of the story which is so fascinating.<br />It's also a great reunion book for people who have followed the story along. There are your criminal favorites, plus Chollo, Fast Eddie Lee, Gino, Vinnie, Tony, etc. Definitely, if you haven't read the previous books, go through them to truly enjoy this one.<br />The story is very well written, with fun descriptions of Vegas and the whole twisted inter-relationships. Spenser's more thoughtful, willing to listen, thinking about how he does things. Maturity and age? Who knows. Susan is very tolerable, becoming more of a &quot;Jewish American Princess&quot;. Strangely, the past two stories had doorknob troubles never heard of before. <br />There are a number of small touches that make the story shine. Bob the Waiter was great, from Bahston. My favorite moment is when Spenser's thinking about the Russians (also moving in to the mob scene) and answers the phone with &quot;Da?&quot; :)	2000-10-03

Instead of annoying women, there's real warmth and personality. Susan starts by getting &quot;Pearl&quot; from her ex-husband. Spenser names her Pearl after a dog of his youth. Paul comes along, wanting to find his mother. We run into Vinnie, who's looking for the mother's boyfriend, Rich, for Joe Broz. Vinnie actually warns Spenser to be careful - Rich is a friend of Joe's kid, Jerry, who they both feel is a &quot;bad apple&quot;. <br />The story is not only about this search, but also about Paul thinking about his past and Susan probing into Spenser's past. We hear about how Spenser's mom died giving him birth, and he grew up with his dad and two uncles in Laramy, WY. They moved out when he was a teenager to Boston. They hunted in Maine, when he had his first drink. They all boxed and taught him how to box. His &quot;only other love&quot; was a high school sweetheart that he was too shy to move on. It's sort of the book to &quot;fill Spenser out&quot; as a person. <br />Very interesting on many levels. It's good after so long to hear what made Spenser the way he is. You have to ignore minor inconsistancies with what has previously been said about Spenser's past and take this as the truth. But what about &quot;Brenda Loring&quot;? Did he not love her despite dating her for over five years? Ah well.<br />If you're a Spenser fan, this is not a book to miss!	2000-10-03

Seamus Heaney won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, in large part because of this book. The poetry isn't archaic or highbrow or needing 80 pages of notes to understand. It's written comfortably and easily, about simple things from his childhood and life. <br />I bought this to take on a trip to Ireland, and it was fantastic reading it while walking the green meadows and rocky coastline. It breathes Irish air. If you have a love for the misty grasses, or simply enjoy rural, quiet life, read through these poems. <br />The poems talk of birth, and love, and death, of heather bells and boats in docks. Give them a try, and be swept away in their gentle language.	2000-10-03

It's fantastic! The drawings with arrows make it VERY clear exactly which bird you're looking at. The maps in the back help clarify where birds live, if you have a question about a bird that looks similar but is defined by its range.<br />The calls listed are very helpful - if you only get a glimpse of something, often you can help narrow down your options by listening to it and seeing which birds match the song pattern. <br />Everything about the book is enormously easy to use. I in fact write right in the book when I've seen a given bird and any additional notes about it - the book is that important to me!<br />One book no birder should be without.	2000-10-03

My 11 year son waits just as eagerly for the next release as I do, and even though the books have gotten amazingly lengthy, we both rip through them as quickly as we can. <br />When Goblet of Fire came out, he read through the entire book in 2 days, handed it over to me, and I stayed up until 5am so I could finish it as well. Since then we have lent it out to numerous friends and relatives who were equally in love with it.<br />It has all the classic elements - good against evil, bullies, unfair situations, misunderstandings, the magic that can help you win even when all seems lost. If nothing else, it is encouraging millions of youngsters to read in an age that tv and computers are replacing books. I applaud J.K. Rowling and wish her all the success in the world.	2000-10-03

Hawk gets him a case looking into a tenure denial, while Susan wants him to help with a stalking. As usual, nothing is simple. Spenser takes care of the stalker but the woman in question becomes addicted to his presence. Meanwhile, the tenure is wrapped up in race, gay pride, outings, and many other concepts. <br />It's amazing how well Parker does with &quot;touchy subjects&quot; - women stalking men, gays outing other gays, race-wise agendas being thwarted by those who should know better. I enjoy greatly reading about these kinds of situations and the moral dilemma that they pose.<br />That's not to say that the book really makes any sense. There are a number of huge plot holes. You don't really read Spenser for the mystery part - you read it for the lovely way Parker writes, for the Boston area mentions, and for the way issues are examined.<br />If you've not read Spenser before, you might want to start from the beginning - you get more out of the series when you understand where the characters are coming from. If you already enjoy Spenser, then you know what to expect - great writing, bizarrely flawed plots.	2000-10-03

Their examples and code blocks have come in helpful more times than I can imagine. Cookies are explained well, and the various database techniques were quick and easy to put into action.<br />On the downside, there are NUMEROUS errors in the code and in the book itself that make it slightly annoying at times. The solution is to simply mark the book up as you go, so you don't make the same mistake twice (or lend the book and inflict the mistake on someone else).<br />Also on the downside, the book doesn't have an easy to use reference section that lays out all options on all of the standard ASP commands you're likely to use. Instead, you have to track down the commands in context and hope it lists what you want to do with a given command. There have been many times that I've sat there guessing at parameters because it doesn't tell me exactly what I needed to know. This definitely can't be the only ASP book you keep by your computer.<br />If you're new to ASP though, this is a great introduction and something to get you started out.	2000-10-03

Susan's on the board of the Port City Theater Company, and asks Spenser to help one of it's employees with a stalking problem. Spenser does, but finds no stalker. Then, during a show, one of the actors is shot. While questioning people, Spenser talks to a board member, which upsets her husband, who controls the Chinese gang in the area. So Spenser has no clues and the Chinese &quot;Death Dragons&quot; after him. <br />To complicate matters (if you believe they aren't already), another woman claims to be stalked, and then is kidnapped. The local police chief is no help, as he's in the &quot;employ&quot; of the Chinese. <br />Things wrap up in the end, but not after some unexpected plot twists and character development that is really stellar. Usually Spenser is just about fantastic writing and environments. This time Parker also put some solid work into developing the characters you meet, and the cultures involved.<br />On the downside, I think Parker was on an &quot;annoying women&quot; kick. This woman was TRULY annoying, although to make up for her, the Chinese translator they use is smart, resourceful, and brave. <br />Port City is very well described - you get a very good sense both of how it feels to wander its streets, and also of its history and people.<br />An interesting sideline, which provides nice counterpoint to the story, has the pair working on a house in Concord - pruning and ripping out the innards. In addition to Susan and Hawk, Spenser calls on the help of Vinnie - a mob friend (ex-main-man of Joe Broz) with amazingly fast gun draw. He has Farrel, the gay police officer help him out, too. <br />All in all, one of the greats in the Spenser lineup.	2000-10-03

First, he's not in Boston, he's down in Georgia dealing with a stable in trouble. That's OK - he's been in other towns before without trouble. Second, however, Hawk is off missing for the entire book. Third, Susan is especially annoying. Gays are thrown in to show PC-ness instead of being truly integral like in his other books. You also get the by now completely annoying continual reference to not-living-together-is-perfect-for-us. <br />The worst part, however, was how completely predictable the entire plot was. What a completely unsatisfying ending. We knew from the very beginning what was going on. There's a side-plot tossed in that is supposed to get you thinking along a certain line, but it's really only beating a dead horse. So to speak.<br />As usual, Parker's writing is fantastic. His irony is great. His characters are fascinating. His plots, though, seem to suffer as time goes on. Once again, there are huge plot holes in the story. Items were dropped in that must have seemed like a good idea in search for a context. <br />If you're a Spenser fan, you'll appreciate the writing style and in general the development of the Spenser characters. If you haven't read Spenser before, go back and start with the earlier books, and work your way up to this one. It might make more sense if you do.	2000-10-03
US	52759271	R33P5EN8R1TB8U	0425177068	105065636	Family Honor (Sunny Randall)	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	A female Spenser? I could only have hoped ...	I love the Spenser series, so I had high hopes when I picked this up. In many ways, it's a little too similar to Spenser. A female private eye, in Boston, knows the good guys, knows the bad guys. She's got a male sidekick who works in the Hawk role, and there's even a Susan-alike too. And a dog. So what's wrong?<br />Well, so much for a female role model. She comments on the decorating of a room. She moans about ponies at parties. She moans about why Tony Marcus won't go take care of things for her ... she's told 80 quadrillion times that the girl is hooking and POOF of course she is. *sigh* <br />My boyfriend had three words: &quot;I hate it.&quot;<br />I tried to be open minded. I didn't mind the Paradise novels. It's good to get a different take on things, even if everything REEKS of Spenser and is set in the same universe. But REALLY! She's always going &quot;I'm independant. I can stand on my own. Hey, ex-hubby, can you talk to people for me? I can't seem to find a girl in one town even though I'm convinced she's hooking. Hey, Tony, why won't you just give her to me? I don't care if your employee has her and is making money. I feel it is Only Right that you hand her over just Because.&quot;<br />ARRRGGGHHHHH.<br />The writing is excellent. The characters and location are great. It's the minor plot flaws, and the huge character flaws, that bug me on this one.	2000-10-03

Broken out by region, the book helps explore what makes a  down-under wine truly unique.<br />The introduction covers general winemaking  knowledge - sunshine hours, necessary nutrients for vines, what various  grapes need to grow, and so on. Once this general grounding is complete,  the book goes on to begins to address the specifics of each wine region in  Australia.<br />Each region has a map showing the locations of sub regions.  The region's history is reviewed, with notes about key individuals involved  and landmark events. Humorous information, such as the fact that the  Barossa Valley was originally named &quot;Barrossa&quot; and lost an R due  to later misspellings, can serve for endless after-dinner discussion.<br />In  addition, the key grape varieties used in Australia are also reviewed. A  page on Riesling compares how it grows in Geisenheim, Clare Valley, Edna  Valley, and Mount Barker. The charts show how rainfall, humidity, sunshine  hours, and even altitude vary, and explains how these differences affect  the grapes. This is interesting reading for any wine drinker who likes to  compare wines from different areas.<br />The real meat of this book, however,  is in its winery details. Each winery in Australia is listed by the region  it is located in. The address, phone and FAX # are listed so you can easily  contact them. In addition there are details on the area of the vineyards,  the winemaker, year of foundation, soil types, grape types grown, and  leading wines. If that's not enough for you, there are also notes on hours  of operation, recent awards won, and relationships with other  wineries.<br />Wine lovers who are looking for ratings of vintage years, or of  ratings of individual wines, will be disappointed. The book does not use  stars or wine bottles or any other system to indicate which wineries are  worthy of attention and which are not. In a way, this helps to extend the  life of the book. Instead of having material which is out of date quickly,  its generalistic approach to the wineries in Australia helps it supplement  the slim tomes on &quot;Wines of the '90s&quot; which would have this sort  of information.<br />On the downside, the core of the book is rather dry.  While the information on the regions and grapes themselves are quite  interesting, the pages and pages of cookie-cutter information on the  wineries can get tedious to go through. While the founding date of a winery  wouldn't change, the other details do, such as the winemaker, owner, key  wines produced, and so on. In addition, wineries are coming into being all  the time, while other wineries shut down.<br />I appreciate the book as a  reference tome, and keep it on my shelf, but in the age of the Internet I  can often find the address of a winery just as easily on the web. I would  have greatly enjoyed it if the book also included reviews of the wines, and  notes on the quality of vintages. Yes, this would mean the book would have  to be reissued every 5 years or so, but I figure I'll have to buy a new  version that frequently anyway, to keep up with the most recent information  on the wineries listed.which wineries are  worthy of attention and which are not.

Fitzgerald's writing style is incredibly evocative - stirring vivid images  in your mind of the mansions of East Egg, of the complex individuals that  lived there and how they interacted. Each person presents one face to the  world, while hiding a wealth of fears and desires. The scene where a car  looses a wheel is one of my favorites - the witty way Fitzgerald turns  words and plays with the individuals is just fantastic. <br />This is  definitely not a book to read 'on assignment', forced to hunt for meaning.  It's a book to read in your 20s or beyond, when you see the way old loves  can still call to you, when temptation strikes sometime to try to turn back  the clock. But of course, you can't, as Fitzgerald demonstrates with such a  wonderful style. There were so many scenes in this book that stood out as  stellar, that sparkled in our minds.<br />I think it's hard for a younger  person to identify with some of the themes in here, just as it's probably  hard for an older person to truly remember what it's like to be a teenager.  It's the kind of book that, if you've lived through love and loss, battled  years to achieve something you realize later wasn't worth it, you finish a  passage and say ... &quot;Yes. That is it exactly.&quot;	2000-06-18

Command & Conquer (Official Strategy Guides)	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Reasonably good, could have been better	As gaming guide for bellaonline.com, I spend a good portion of my time testing games and reading the strategy guides to see if I missed anything. I *love* Red Alert as a game, but this book doesn't quite do justice to it.  The maps they give you are pretty hideous, and the descriptions they give  of the solutions to missions are often extremely vague. I realize it's hard  to do a walkthrough for a game like this, but there are usually methods  that work very well for a mission, and they simply don't give you those  details. The first 60 pages are wasted on troop reviews! I like their tip  system, and feel they were on the right track ... they just didn't quite  get there.	2000-03-18

We grabbed a copy of this book after finishing the game to see if we missed anything. We hadn't, but  the book did!  Despite their overly-detailed microsecond-by-microsecond  photos, there were mistakes and wrong information. It would have been  better if they gave the instructions in a more logical manner, and cut out  on the gloss. It's OK if you want reading material to look at pictures, but  for real information you can do much better than this elsewhere.	2000-03-18

This one is a great exception!  The book is extremely well laid out, with clear, easy to use maps, tips and  techniques. The instructions are all dead on. But best of all, the book  isn't written assuming you're 2 years old. It's written with a fantastic  style, with humor and knowledge all mixed together. I was extremely  impressed, and this has stayed on my shelves while other books were tossed  out long ago!	2000-03-18

For those below who found it too complex, I recommend getting the audio tape. The &quot;strange&quot; names no longer catch you; the rhythms can truly be heard. The style of writing is, indeed, part of the story.<br />For those who compare it to a creative writing exercise, well, yes, what do you think 'creative writing' was trying to teach you, anyway?	1998-06-05

Yes, I am female, I am strong minded and hold my own. I've read more books than I can count over the past 30 years. And I hate the females in this series! I've read the first three books three times, and I can't make myself go any further. I *love* the way Jordan writes. I love to read, and his style is very engaging. But listening to females with the minds of 6-year-olds pouting and stomping about drives me completely insane. I've actually moaned out loud at the drivel that comes out of their mouths. Why can't he write something with NORMAL PEOPLE in it???	1998-05-06

I really admire his ethics, and like the characterizations, but Susan bugs me. She romps through life, treating Spenser unkindly, and he sticks by her. Does she deserve it? In this novel she's not exactly sane. At least she helps him with a brick at for sure that Brad won't come back and kill Susan later! What bothered me most was his train of thought with the &quot;cheated-on husband&quot; - it's better to be lied to than to know the truth. WHAT???	1998-05-06

On camping weekends, we would often sit around a bonfire and tell each other stories, drawn out, about lives and loves. That's exactly how this tale was told, thousands of years ago, and finally we have a version that again makes it available to &quot;normal folk&quot;. Instead of struggling through allusions and references that need three footnotes, an &quot;average citizen&quot;, without a full English degree, can pop the cassette into his tape deck and hear the glory and fury of this classic tale. It was meant to be heard and absorbed and mulled over, not studied as a &quot;period piece&quot;! This translation fits the bill perfectly.	1998-04-29
