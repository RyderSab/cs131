This book and a couple hours practice did the trick.  It taught me all the golf specific jargon, the rules, and the basics of proper swing and form.  Whether you want to play like a pro, or just play well enough to keep from looking like a fool, this is a perfect starting place.	2004-09-15

A bastion of salmonella and other nasties.  After reading this book, I grill at least once a week, and every time is a success.  My wife and daughter beg me to grill up some dogs and burgers.  This book is for anyone who hasn't had much luck with charcoal grilling in the past, or anyone without any grilling experience.  If you follow Mr. Raichlen's advice, you will be the local grill master.	2004-09-15

This book came into my hands just when I needed it, but who doesn't need a good laugh?  I was laughing so hard I had tears.  The true test came when my husband asked what in the world could be so funny.  He actually asked me to read some parts to him, and before we knew it we were both laughing at entire chapters read out loud.

As the other reviewers mentioned earlier this book dealt with so many 'bad' subjects.  The author handled them all so well.  I loved the character Annie.  I seen myself in her, the good and the bad.  Mrs. Haas was perfectly demented.  The character went deeper and deeper in a slow manner at first--and then the build up to the ending.  Very good novel.  I would've liked to have seen more time spent on Simon Haas though.  I will definately be looking for this author's next novel.	2004-09-03

If you want to know anything about the XML configuration files, EAR files, or WAR files, you will be forced to look elsewhere.  Basically, the code presented is the same thing over and over again, with the Application Deployment Tool settings changed.  The book is jammed packed with images of the App Dep Tool settings... space I think would be much better filled with either more thorough examples, or info on the XML files.  If you only want a very cursory look at EJBs this book is for you.	2004-08-31

Like many of Anne Tyler's other books the plot is well thought out, but with twists enough to keep us reading. I really became involved with the characters and found them to be so real sounding. I found traits in them that are in people I know. Ian and dealing with his guilt and grief will stay with me for a long time. I think we all, at times in our lives, have that desire to know what we can do to make atonement for the wrong(s) we've done in our lives. Did Ian find that? A great book, and a definate good look at guilt, religion, and what saves. But not just for the &quot;religious&quot; out there.	2004-07-31

The book is long enough to get you to understand the VHDL language, without being so long as to bore you to tears.  After reading the book, I feel that I could design most any simple-medium complexity digital circuit in VHDL without much difficulty.  My only complaint is the author's poor indenting of his code.  This makes it difficult at times to follow the flow of his code.  Other than this minor flaw, the book is perfect.	2004-06-06

First, you are learning un-pointed Hebrew from chapter 2.  I thought un-pointed Hebrew would be difficult, but with a little repetition, I was amazed with how easy it actually is.  Second, the website is great.  It takes a few minutes to figure out how to navigate the site, but after that it is an amazing resource.  It is particularly nice to be able to hear every word used in the text and insure that your pronunciation matches.  Last, I found each of the exercises in the book to be very well written and helpful in thoroughly understanding the Hebrew vocabulary and grammar.  Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to learn Hebrew.	2004-05-18

But that's the way it is with collections of short stories.  I was not disturbed by any of the stories, although I should have read the Amazon reviews before picking up the book as I was not at all prepared for what was coming.  But the stories and the feelings of lust and loss were very intersting.  I just didn't feel that any of the characters were developed fully.  The first story, The Strangers at the Palazzo D'Oro was the best in my opinion.  I always enjoy stories that are told from the perspective of the main character looking back on their life.  I just wish there would've been a little more to it.  Sex gets old when there's not more dialogue and plot.	2004-04-13

I'm biased though as I also loved Losing Julia.  Jonathan Hull has a way with words and characters.  All the characters were well developed.  A troubled teen is taken in by his grandfather for the summer.  The grandfather eventually takes him to the Europe that he experienced during WWII.  Both confront their demons and win.  Amazing.  A read that could be enjoyed by young and old alike.  There were some nice plot turns here too.  Also, my personal favorite is the peeks into the characters thoughts and their dialogue.  I do not like a book that is too &quot;sappy&quot; and this one if full of wit and sarcasm and real responses.  Loved it.	2004-04-13

The characters, some you love and hate.  Demille's characters are amazing.  It's the same in all 5 of this books that I've read.  There's no sappy dialogue, or stupid replies.  Everything is witty and sharp.  I wish that I had read the one with a map of the church, but after awhile I got pretty good at imagining what the inside of the cathedral looked like.  In the end it definitely had me waiting with held breath to see what would happen.	2004-04-13

Hard to believe.  The main character has charm and yet is cynical and sarcastic.  My favorite type of character.  He's Paul Brenner and a wonderful character to get to know.  The General's daughter is killed on post and the story resolves around her hidden life and the desire to find her killer.  All the while dealing with Army regulations and rules.  This book is full of mystery and lies.  Amazing to see how they solve it.  A definite five star recommendation.	2004-04-13

I didn't feel that the ending was ever really resolved.  But to me that was part of the charm of the novel.  But to see how the character gets out of everything and has had everything planned from the start definately takes a little suspension from reality.	2004-04-12

She just leaves while the rest of the family is on vacation....starts to walk and never looks back.  There are some great characters in the book.  The main character, Delia, is hollow feeling to me though.  I feel for her and there are times when I really relate, and other times where I could almost put the book down--but am too curious about the ending to do that.  A very interesting read, but I felt let down by the ending.  If you enjoy Anne Tyler though and her odd characters as I do, then it's worth the read though.	2004-04-12

Wouldn't we all like to do something of that nature.  Anyhow, he falls in love and marries someone most unlikely.

I read the whole thing in a day.  It took a few minutes to get into though and I almost gave up, but kept chugging along anyway as the characters thoughts and dialogue was witty and cynical.  If anything had been too sappy I would've put the book down and never looked back.  The interaction between Artemis and the fairies is quite fun once you get used to it.  You want to keep reading just to see if Artemis is as smart as he thinks he is.  Not to mention that I fell head over heels for the character Butler.  Fun read.	2004-04-12

Mr. Wheelock does a great job of presenting the language in a logical and exciting way.  His use of speeches, stories, and quotes from ancient authors make learning Latin exciting.  Make no mistake about it, Latin is a complicated and often difficult language, but Mr. Wheelock walks you through everything step by step.  One of the greatest advantages of using this book is the tremendous amount of books, study guides, and on-line resources that are designed to aid you with Wheelock's Latin. So you will never end up being lost without having somewhere to turn for additional help. The only flaw in this book is the lack of an answer key for the quotes at the end of each chapter.<br />Homo doctus in se semper divitias habet	2004-01-09

After reading the glowing reviews on this book, I thought it would be a great introductory text for learning Hebrew.  However, when I opened the book I was sorely disappointed.  Chapter one starts out with a story written in Hebrew.  If I knew Hebrew, I wouldn't need this book.  But the author assumes you know 150 Hebrew words including: father, eats, mother, says, I, you, please, school, son, morning, chalk, garden, window, etc.  It's common practice in language books to skip over words that are obvious cognates, but since Hebrew has no relationship with English, the only cognates are those words that have become a part of our language due to religion such as seraph and hallelujah.  This is the only level one language book I've ever seen that makes such large assumptions about the readers knowledge of a language.	2004-01-09

What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter'	2004-01-07

I bought this book as my first step in learning Hebrew so that I can read the Old Testament in the original Hebrew.  After reading this book, I feel confident in my ability to read Hebrew words, and feel ready to begin my study of vocabulary and grammar.  This book is absolutely amazing.  The author uses repetition, and builds on what you have learned each lesson, so that by the time you reach the 10th lesson, you have no problem remembering the previous 9.  My only complaint about this book is the authors use of Jewish terms to define the sounds of characters.  This is fine of course for the Jewish student, but as a non-Jew, not knowing how to pronounce the words he is using causes some minor problems.  Aside from that, this book is absolutely perfect.	2004-01-04

My wife is not particularly technically oriented, and was able to grasp the topics presented in the book without any trouble.  If you are interested in joining the ham radio ranks to communicate with people around the world, to experiment with radio equipment, or just to chat with local hams, this book will get you started.  It explains all the questions in the Technician question pool, and contains a list of all the questions you need to know as well as the answers.  Everything you need to know to get started is inside.	2004-01-04

First, not enough attention is given to noun declensions and verb conjugations.  The author passes over a lot of this and says that it's not really important.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is nothing more important in Latin than the noun declensions.  Without a sound understanding of declensions, you will be left guessing who did what with what to whom.  Second, words or topics often show up on the end of the chapter quizzes before they are covered.  This is very frustrating when you are really trying to learn the material.  One of the things this books does really well is to bombard you with new words.  Learning vocabulary is often one of the most difficult things in learning a new language, and this one does a great job of presenting this vocabulary to you.  However, because of the flaws in this text, I would recommend Wheelock's Latin instead of this text for the person wishing to gain a sound understanding of Latin.	2003-11-19

This book starts you at the very beginning by showing you how memory is addressed, how the internals of the computer work, and numbering systems.  Although he doesn't really get into programming until later in the book, by the time he gets there you actually understand what is going on at a low level.  And let's face it... if you don't understand the low level of the computer, you don't stand a chance at really understanding Assembly Language.  This book should be the starting point for anyone who wants to learn Assembly.  Once you've mastered this book, you should be able to pick up any more advanced book and understand what is going on.	2003-11-19

Because they want to be able to read things in Latin: State Mottoes, those funny sayings on money, and the works of Roman authors.  This book gives you the opportunity to read stories written in Latin after you have finished chapter 3 of Wheelock's Latin, allowing you to both test what you have learned, and to do what you really want to do: read Latin.	2003-11-19

The STL contains some of the most useful features of the C++ library, and without a strong knowledge of the STL you will end up writing a lot of code that already exists.  Most books said to be a tutorial and reference usually do a poor job as a tutorial, and provide too much fluff for a reference.  This book is the exception.  If you want to learn the STL, or need a good reference, this is the only book you will want to have on your desk.	2003-11-19

The story of Achilles and his fellow Greeks is an amazing tale of pride, love, greed, anger, rage, and human emotion.  This book is a wealth of wisdom and philosophy of the ancient Greeks told in the form of an epic.  In this book, we see how the pride of Achilles nearly destroys the entire Greek army, how the greed of Agamemnon and his pride cause incalculable losses to the Greeks, and how the cowardly Paris steals a man's wife and lets everyone else fight for him.  This is more than a mere story, but a book of ancient wisdom second only to the Bible.  The story is amazing... but it is the demonstration of the evils of life and their consequences that make this book truly great.  The feelings of the characters, and the ability to identify with their thoughts, feelings, and emotions really turn a war story into a story of the human psyche.  5 stars also go to the translator who has made this book as easy to read as any piece of modern literature.	2003-11-15
US	49372308	R3IAEAIXKPTGZP	0451527364	627065254	The Odyssey (Signet Classics)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An amazing tale	The Odyssey is an amazing tale of the travels of Odysseus and his crew after the Trojan War.  His encounters with the Cyclops, sea monsters, Sirens, Gods, and ghosts create a tale larger than life.  Mr. Rouse does an amazing job of translating the tale in a way that flows well and reads easily.  My only complaint of this classic is the ending... in 1 1/2 pages things go from nearly a civil war to peace.  It appears almost as if homer had not finished the tale before his death, and someone else added the ending just to finish the book.  Aside from the ending, the entire book is a masterpiece of ancient literature.	2003-11-15

Wow... this book is amazing.  I had made it through chapter 10 of Wheelock's Latin, with a fair amount of success... but something just didn't click.  I purchases the Comprehensive Guide to Wheelock's Latin to aid me, and now have a complete understanding of the subjects covered by Wheelock.  Wheelock's Latin is well written, and does a great job teaching Latin... but the Comprehensive Guide acts as a tutor to insure you really know what you think you know.  If Wheelock's Latin is your map to learning Latin, The Comprehensive Guide to Wheelock's Latin should be your compass.	2003-10-30

His examples and explanations brilliantly explain the topics. This book is actually a very interesting approach to something that at first glance would appear dull and dry. There are plenty of charts and diagrams, as well as the source code for popular encryption algorithms.  These visuals, and the accompanying text have really aided me in understanding cryptography. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to have a better understanding of cryptography.<br />Great job Mr. Schneier.	2003-07-31

I always thought Calculus was a useless, dull topic, but after reading this book, I have found how useful it is, as well as how easy it can be. The authors approach to such a dull topic is outstanding. If you want to learn Calculus, without all the confusion that comes with the topic, this book is for you.	2003-07-31

The author has great information on how to secure your router, usefull information on creating access lists to block standard DoS attacks, and some great information on VPNs. The book also covers TFTP, Syslog, and SNMP setup for both the router, and UNIX and Windows hosts. The last 2 chapters present very useful scenarios for both large and small networks.  The only things that were lacking was the chapters on routing (doesn't really go into any detail on setting up routing protocols), and the chapter on LAN protocols which barely touches on IPX, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI. Overall, if you already have a decent understanding of the Cisco IOS, and want to get some knowledge outside of the normal CCNA type information, this is the book for you.	2001-06-02

Demonstrates how to effectively Debug code, how to optimize  code, and gives down to earth practical instruction on C programming. I  would recomend this book to anyone wanting to learn C, or to anyone who  knows C and wants to further their knowledge of good C programming theory.	2000-08-30
