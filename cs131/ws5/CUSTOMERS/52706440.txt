Most of the book is spent eating and drinking in this cafe and that during  a seven day fiesta in Spain, but at the conclusion, I thought &quot;what  was the point?&quot;  Good desriptive, easy to read prose, but if there was  a significant plot, it was lost on me.	1998-11-11

Prometheus Bound is a play about mythical Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and was punished by Zeus to be bound to a rock.  The play itself is very short and if you are familiar with the  fable, this book really doesn't add much.	1998-11-04

A great backdrop and idea for a book are really wasted in this series  because of a few serious flaws.   The first is the extreme repetitiveness  of dialogue.  Characters are thinking the exact same thing through out the  whole series.  No exaggeration to say that some paragraphs are repeated  almost verbatim 10-15 times in this book alone.  GET AN EDITOR!!     The  2nd major flaw is the shallowness of all characters.  I could have wrote  the dialogue for half the characters, especially the baseball characters.   The WWII backdrop isn't real deep either.  The 3rd problem is the authors  lack of feeling for suspense.  For example, he spends a few of the books  building up Jens Larrsen's character - a frustrated nucleur physicist who  turns traitor, and then has him shot by US troops in half a page with  little fanfare.  Ditto for Otto Skorzeny, the other interesting character  in the books.  Cut out 30 pages of &quot;gee, we didn't think the humans  would be so advanced&quot; and put it into the demise of these characters  and it would have been better spent. Lastly, the ending was nothing.  Just  a set up for another series.  Most storylines are unfinished.  I usually  love this type of series, but would only recommend it for throwaway  reading.	1998-10-30

A good storyline and  backdrop, but the author repeats himself an awful lot.  For example, in the  first book the Lizards are suprised at how technologically advanced the  humans are.  In the 3rd book, there are still pages and pages of various  lizards lamenting the same thing in almost the same words.  Character  development stopped somewhere in the 2nd book also.  1,200 pages into this  series, the baseball player characters still relate everything back to  playing minor league ball, almost verbatim in some spots.  Could have  edited the first three books into one or two faster, better books.	1998-10-22

The backdrop is excellent, but  there is a real shortage of action in this installment and some of the  dialogue gets downright corny.  The character development also stopped at  some point, because 950 pages into this series, the baseball player  characters are still referencing everything they do back to their baseball  careers.  It does read quickly and a couple of the story lines are  intriguing, so not a complete waste, I just expected better with the hype.	1998-10-16

The  historical background is really lacking in detail.  If you are looking for  a more in depth WWII alternate history, try Robert Harris  &quot;Fatherland&quot;.  The book is written in a Tom Clancy style (10  groups of characters with the action rotating through each group until they  start to come togehter) and is entertaining but doesn't cover a lot of new  ground.	1998-10-09

The section on Tony LaRussa shows the excruciating detail that goes into what appears to be a simple game.

A great science fiction book, with real character development and a intricate yet readable stroy line.  This book, the first in the Honor Harrington series kept me turning pages from the start.  The book centers around a female captain of a Manticoran starship.  Manticore is in the middle of a cold war with Haven, and the confrontations are suspenceful and unpredictable. I expected more of a David Drake shootout story, but found a much richer, satisfying book.  The minute I finished, I went to the store and bought the next two in the series.

What starts as a convoy escort for the captain turns into a flashpoint in the Cold War with 2 technologically backwards planets as pawns.

When the plant is shut down, he gets approval to transfer his workers to a new plant in Moravia, saving them from Auschwitz.  The book is more a documentary of survivor accounts than a novel.  The story is told honestly and does not inflate the legend of Oskar, rather tells it in a matter of fact way.  A wonderful story of humanity in the face of the Holocaust	1997-03-04

The plot didn't show any originality and I thought the whole book was living off of its past reputation.  Even the surprise reunion at the end seemed like a poorly developed afterthought.  Part of the problem is that the main characters have become so powerful, that it's tough to come up with something believable to challenge them.  Although this was to be the last in the series, I expect at least 4 more. 1.  Six years on the Sea Sprite 2.  Zaknafein reunion  3.  Journey to the Soaring Spirit  4.
