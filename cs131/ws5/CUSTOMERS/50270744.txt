In fact, many more Australians died on the Western Front in France than at Gallipoli. Nevertheless, the Gallipoli-hardened veterans assumed a special status within the defence forces and at home as early as 1915, and the term 'ANZAC' was born at the cove and in the gullies of the rugged Turkish peninsula known now as 'Gallipoli'.<br />My grandfather was at Gallipoli, and Flanders and the Somme in France. Like the vast majority of his comrades who were fortunate enough to return, he hated talking about the war with his family other than in the vaguest way. He roundly denounced all war as a result of the horrors he witnessed.<br />Most of the young travellers Wright encounters are the great-grandchildren of the WW1 soldiers. Their search for connection and inter-generational meanings is nowadays backed up with academic and family based reseacrh efforts and a superb, and accessible national archive. At the date of writing this review, there are now only 5 survivors of WW1 left alive in Australia.<br />Wright has managed to capture the spirit and motivations of the modern pilgrims, as well as depict the tourist industry which has grown up to service their needs. Often they arrive as ignorant as their great-grandfathers did on this Aegean shore . Hopefully they leave better informed, and with a thirst to know more.<br />Wright examines the criticisms of the partying and over-indulgence in alcohol accompanying the Anzac Day (April 25th - the day of the landing at Gallipoli) commemorations each year, and concludes that the young people share much of the exuberance and joie de vivre of their equally free-spirited forbears. He also portrays the sober, good-natured manner of the actual commemorative services, and the positive interactions with their modern Turkish counterparts.<br />This is a very good book in the 'travel writing' genre, well-written by an experienced journalist. It is easy to read, and imbued with informed opinion. It is also much more, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with any interest at all in understanding this particularly Australian 'pilgrimage' phenomenon.t the young people share much of the exuberance and joie de vivre of their equally free-spirited forbears.

Some of the people fleeing their personal demons. She writes most sympathetically of those who have sought safe harbour from systemic persecution.<br />Nadel has successfully managed to weave an engaging modern-day crime novel together with a strong sense of place and with a fascinating historical background. Along the way, we learn to care about the characters who populate the series, most especially Ikmen's family.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book - all the elements have been 'got right' - plot, characterisation and location for a thoroughly diverting read.	2004-06-24
US	50270744	R3CKWRIFT5JAAL	0385337221	607191294	A Season for the Dead	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Taut crime / thriller	I very much enjoyed this book. It will appeal to and be sought out by readers of series crime novels set in vividly depicted locations. Readers of Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series, which features another Rome-based cop, Donna Leon's Inspector Brunetti, and Barbara Nadel's Istanbul cop, Inspector Ikmen should enjoy this as well.<br />The identity of the killer is unknown to the reader for about the first half of the book. It is then revealed to the reader, so in that sense there is no last-page denoument. However, there are other mysteries around motivation that propel the mystery forward and keep the reader guessing til (almost) the end!<br />If you are squeamish about fairly graphic depictions of violence you may not be as drawn to this book. I compare it to some of the scenes in, for example, Carol O'Connell's 'Killing Critics', featuring New York cop Mallory.<br />Hewson manages to depict a sense of place very successfully, so Rome assumes an identity as a 'character' alongside the human protagonists. Anyone with an interest in the art of Caravaggio will be equally enthralled, as Nic Costa, the young main character cop, is an afficianado. There is some vivid imagery involving several of the paintings of that 17th century Roman 'badboy'.	2004-06-24

Having lived in that exciting city for a while, I think she captures its nuances and everyday life as much as its &quot;exoticism&quot; perfectly. As such, the setting will make this (and the rest of the Cetin Ikmen police procedurals) attractive to many lovers of the crime genre. However, Ms Nadel does not stick just to the exotic image of tourist Istanbul, but takes you down its alleyways and into its darker sides.<br />Nadel is billed as &quot;the Donna Leon of Istanbul&quot;, which tells you which market the publishers are pitching for. This is not without justification, and I think Ms Nadel exceeds in brining her location, and characters to life.<br />There is a likeable cast of ongoing characters and her mysteries are well plotted and intriguing. Blathazar's Daughter was a fine debut. This is the third (the second is &quot;A Chemical Prison&quot;), and as a crime genre addict I was not disappointed.	2004-06-11

In the end, I just let it flow, and it did come together in the end.<br />Like with most of the characters in a Zen novel, you can never be sure to what extent anyone (including Zan!) is a 'goodie' or a 'baddie'. There are precarious few 'goodies'!!<br />An excellent addition to the series. The next book &quot;And Then You Die&quot; is like a coda to this one - so make sure you don't read it first by accident!	2004-06-08

I don't belive it stands alone at all, and would not suggest this as an entry point to the Zen series.<br />However, if you HAVE read Blood Rain, then I suggest you do read it. Despite the initially sunny and carefree setting, Zen's demons are REALLY dark, and his sanity in question, as a result of events in Blood Rain.<br />Fortunately, things are looking up for Zen by the end, but I have to say I was very disappointed in the plotting in the final section especially. Whereas Zen has previously used guile, subterfuge and some dubious, even 'shady' techniques for getting himself out of trouble, I felt the actions here were too crude and simplistic, and then more closely resembled farce than displaying any plot ingenuity.<br />This was by far the most disappointing in the series for me, but I am glad that Zen is back!	2004-06-08

The cast of regular characters develope throughout, and previous cases are referred to in subsequent books.<br />I therefore recommend that you read the series in order.<br />This book is as well-crafted a mystery as its predecessors. This time Zen is working in the neighbourhood of his long term residence (Rome), but there is much to explore in that city, along with Zen. I was particularly engaged by the 'chase' (on foot) sequence through the Forum.	2004-06-08

First in Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series.<br />A terrific start to an extremely well-written detective series, set in various places in Italy (this one in Perugia). It is a very good idea to start at the beginning and read the series in order, unless you don't mind obtaining mosaic-like insights into the motivations, psychology and personal relationships of the almost-but-not-quite 'anti-hero' Zen. The outcomes of previous cases are discussed in subsequent books, which could prove to spoil earlier ones for a non-sequential reader.<br />Dibdin conveys the Italian settings well - you can almost feel yourself walking alongside Zen through the piazzas of Rome and the precipitous streets of Perugia.<br />Zen is not another Commissario Brunetti (Donna Leon's equally as engaging Venetian detective). Zen's psychology is much darker, his demons more active, his personality more brittle and his relationships more fragile. Above all, his morality is more able to cope with (and indulge in) matters not always just 'shady', but sometimes downright illegal. Dibdin does successfully capture, however, the Italian body politic with both its unbending public bureaucracy and more flexible private state.<br />For an intelligent police procedural, with well-drawn characters, and a wonderful sense of place, I heartily recommend Ratking as a wonderful series opener.	2004-06-08

I rarely don't finish a book once started, but this one defeated me around page 500!<br />Much of the material is repeated. A 250 page synthesis would perhaps be more relevant to the reader coming new to the subject. I appreciate others with a background in hearing about it may gain more from this book.	2004-06-08

If Brunetti engages you here, you will want to come back for more. As you do, you will learn more about him and the 'supporting cast' of regular characters.<br />One of the delights of the series is that Venice itself unfolds in all its magnificent moods and beauties as the series progresses.<br />You don't really need to read this series in order, unlike Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series, which definitely benefits from sequential reading). Whilst you do learn more about Brunetti, his family relationships, motivationsa nd political points of view as the series progresses, stand-alone reading does not spoil another book in the series.<br />Having said that, if you have alraedy read later books, you will find this book is not as 'opened out' in setting and characterisation, and one of the most beloved characters, Signorina Elettera, does not appear until about Book 4! Don't let that stop you 'going back' and experiencing this engaging story though!	2004-06-08

US	50270744	R1AJSGLB3UKHXY	0743417844	761051388	The Bomber	Books	2	0	3	N	N	Disappointing	A fairly formulaic who-dun-it, which plods along without too many surprises. There are no plausible red herrings, merely a rather slow unfolding of events. Both the books I have read featuring newspaperwoman Annika Berengtzon follow the same path - a murder, followed by Annika's belief that all is not as it appears on the surface (she gleans this mainly through unspoken nuances from her police contact). Thereafter follow conflicts in the workplace as Annika has to prove that she is correct in the face of unreasonable opposition from various colleagues, and a climax which places Annika in highly improbable personal danger, from which she (naturally) escapes.<br />The newspaper setting rings true, as Marklund has obvious experience in that area. Some of the characters are quite well drawn, and they are the most interesting part of the book for me. Some of the expositions about the way things work in Sweden are belaboured, but nevertheless informative. However, in a novel, a better author would find a more naturalistic style of imparting information rather than through a mini-lecture style exposition.<br />Unfortunately, for me, the language is flat and rather leaden. This may be the result of translation. A few things jar (for example Annika going round to the `back side of the building' - rather than the back. )<br />Other times it is a preoccupation with minute and unnecessary detail, which adds nothing to the story or characterisation:<br />\\" She walked over to her office and suddenly realized she was starving. She went over to Berit and asked if she'd like to go to the staff canteen. She did, so they picked up their coupons and set off. They were serving Christmas ham with potatoes and apple sauce tonight . . .<br />They skipped the ham and chose the salad bar instead. The big canteen was almost empty, and they took a table in the corner.\\"<br />A whole lot of unnecessary words that add no value at all.	2004-05-17

Venice does not give up its secrets easily, and Dibdin is a master at ensuring the tension builds and the plot is assisted through location. He is equally adept at characterisation - the restless, driven Zen, who confronts several ethical dilemmas along the way, and several of the supporting &quot;cast&quot; , all of whom come to life and populate the setting magnificently.<br />The story itself is intriguing, with enough revelations along the way. There is no great finale denouement, more a piecing together of the jigsaw, and one great personal revelation about Zen's family background.<br />I thought Dibdin was at his very best when the action moves to the Questura (police headquarters). I half expected Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti to come strollign along the corridor!<br />The &quot;chase&quot; sequence - on foot and boat through wintry night time Venice was also excellent.<br />Thoroughly recommended for anyone who enjoys top quality crime fiction.

I enjoy both the coastal and desert locales in which it is set, and, although I was about to scream if Grafton told us the colour of the desert soil once more, she did manage to capture the landscape extremely well. As well, throughout the series, Grafton has had a pretty good way with bringing to life Smalltown, USA and its inhabitants. This is no exception.<br />* the 'Odd Couple' like characters - the two retired / medically unfit police officers. I could see Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau perfectly cast (if they weren't dead alreay).<br />* Aspects of the police procedural.<br />* The interesting depth added to Kinsey's family relationships in this book. A newly emerging relationship with an aunt, which has surprised even Kinsey in the way it has affected her. At last she is beginning to open up to possibilities.<br />Now, what I didn't like:<br />* I agree with the reviewer who says everything is over-described. Cutting down the number of adjectives and 'languid' takes on every action and place would make a tighter read.<br />* However, my biggest disappointment and the reason for the 2 stars is that I think there is a major plotting / logic flaw in this novel. The key clue is dropped on page 19. To me, it stood out a million miles away. I spent the rest of the books getting angrier and angrier at what was to me an elemental flaw in something which was meant to be a police procedural. Surely, given the notes taken at the time a record was kept of who and where the missing person report, later retracted, came from. It would have eliminated about half the book, in hurrying the solving of the 'who was Jane Doe' part of the story.<br />* The rather formulaic and lazy way that the investigation in Quorum is plotted. &quot;Oh, here's 2 or 3 possibilities (schools / dentists)...let's travel with Kinsey to the first two, which will be easily eliminated, although there will be a bit of a thread which we will come back to later (the school secretary/ dental records) and on the third try she will come up trumps.&quot; That's plot padding, and it's predictable. You know every conversation will be sewn with one thread of information, and I'm afraid the reader doesn't have to work very hard to pick it out.<br />So, in summary - the character Kinsey is developing little by little, but the plotting of the mystery is getting lazy, and the padding out of the story tiresome.will be easily eliminated, although there will be a bit of a thread which we will come back to later (the school secretary/ dental records) and on the third try she will come up trumps.&quot; That's plot padding, and it's predictable.

The subject matter interested me - dealing with grief and mid-life relationship crisis. I liked the setting and felt he evoked the landscape superbly. He also captured small town, insular Australia exceptionally well in the few characters drawn from the locale. Georgie's role as an outsider in her wealthy family rang true.<br />Actually the sum of the parts rang more true for me than when it was put together. The idea of the grand passion coming at a time when she was adrift emotionally was good. The hurt of the young boys which isolated her within the domestic setting was achingly poignant. Small town politics and the dynamics of Jim's place in a power structure was interesting and not something I can recall having read much of in the past, especially with respect to my own culture (Australian).<br />However, I found the last part of the book troublesome, and I think it disintegrated once the action moved to the remote island. I found it unbelievable and a bit of a Survivor / Boys Own Adventure stretch of the imagination.<br />Winton is a fluid writer - I didn't find the prose clumsy, cliched or contrived, I didn't cringe at all as I all too often find myself doing these days. I reckon there's a great book inside here wanting to get out. I read that Winton was ages behind on deadline for delivery of this, and seemed to be blocked. I read he had a whole different book written, which he scrapped and then wrote this almost in one go. I think it shows.<br />I am going to seek out some more of Winton's work, because I think he's a skilled writer, exploring some themes I find interesting, and his settings wonderful, and I have read better Winton books than this - Cloudsteet, and children's books The Deep and The Bugalugs Bum Thief .	2004-04-05

The settings for their crime stories are as much stars as the people. In that sense, both are equally successful. Both detectives also have family relationships with their wives and children which are brought to life and have a bearing on the stories. Both detectives also have internal conversations which are thoughtful and humane.<br />I believe if you enjoy Leon, you will also enjoy Nadel, though both are distinctive writers able to bring their characters and places to life.	2004-04-04

The opening sentence is a pure joy and sets the tone for the arch and very wry humour:<br />\\" Take my camel, dear,\\" said my aunt Dot, as she climbed down from this animal on her return from High Mass.\\"<br />Often dubbed a \\"classic\\", it made me wonder what is the definition of a classic? For me it is something which continues to hold truths even beyond the context of its specific setting and time. Jane Austen  and Shakespeare, for example continue to astound because you can't help wondering \\"How did they know THAT when something seems particularly apt to the 21st century human condition.<br />There is a lot in this book that fits that definition.  Many of the observations contained within stand true some 50 years later. The idea of people writing their \\"Turkey books\\" is amusing and the humour droll. One need only think of the recent \\"running away to southern France / Spain / Tuscany\\" genre. The musings on the place of spirituality in various manifestations, and the intersection between pragmatism and organised religion is interesting.<br />I am taken by the fact that we never know the narrator's gender. The name \\"Laurie\\" can be either male or female, particularly in the English context (eg author Laurie Lee was male;  ).The \\"illicit\\" relationship could almost equally be a homosexual relationship. The behaviour of the narrator provides certain clues, such as riding the camel and offering lifts to Turkish country men. I doubt whether that would have been at all possible for a lone travelling female. On the other hand, the narrator talks at one point about a non-possible future with his/her lover (definitely a male) and \\"their children\\". Of course the lover has children within his marriage, and the narrator may have expected to marry and have children. Male homosexuals commonly did (and still do) just that.<br />In other passages, the narrator drinks alone with another male companion in a bar, not something which could even necessarily be accommodated in 1950s Turkey for male and female acquaintances.<br />Not everyone is going to like this book or engage with the themes, but if you enjoy well-written descriptions, musings on the human condition which are effused with wry irony, then give it a go!, not something which could even necessarily be accommodated in 1950s Turkey for male and female acquaintances.<br />Not everyone is going to like this book or engage with the themes, but if you enjoy well-written descriptions, musings on the human condition which are effused with wry irony, then give it a go!	2004-04-04

Not only insights into some of the great literature in English, including my favourites, The Great Gatsby and Jane Austen, but also fascinating perspectives on what it was like to be part of the educated and cultured class within Iran when the Islamic revolution occurred.<br />The Austen chapter begins \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Muslim man, regardless of his fortune, must be in want of a nine-year-old virgin wife.\\" That was uttered by one of the students in Nafisi's study group, and is typical of many wry moments emanating from these young women Nafisi had gathered in order to study some of the \\"great works\\" of literature in English, in the face of darkening revolutionary shadows which will make it increasingly difficult to do so in public paces.<br />What an amazing way to explore matters of romance and social relationships of interest to these young women in a totally different place, time and culture.<br />It is very easy to forget that in any period of upheaval, there is going to be a variety of viewpoints and passionate advocates of multifarious positions. This is extremely well conveyed by Nafisi.<br />One of the most memorable passages to me (some 6 months after reading this and as an insatiable bookbuyer), is that where she goes into a bookshop to scoop up as many copies of a particular book as she can, as such works and shops become increasingly unobtainable.<br />I found the tale of what of what it was like working in the universities during this period of upheaval , and the various strategies Nafisi employed to get around the increasing strictures, especially fascinating.<br />I did have a little trouble at times differentiating one of the young women from the literature group, but in the end I let it all wash over me and just revel in the emotions and happenings.<br />I got very little sense of the writer's relationship with her husband, which I know isn't the main concern of the book. Nevertheless, it did diminish her a little I felt. We read professional reactions, but I would love to  have a little more about how the revolution affected personal relationships. That is a minor point though, as there was some, and it obviously wasn't an autobiography per se. We did manage to glean  a range of different reactions through the women students, so that was useful.<br />I found the relationship with the shadowy figure \\"the magician\\" a bit unsatisfying. It did, however, add to a sense that the type of insight being looked for wasn't being achieved within what might otherwise be the closer personal relationship of marriage.<br /><br />All told, I loved this book and have it beside my bed to read again.less, it did diminish her a little I felt.

Particularly attractive is the rather enigmatic Signorina Elettra, for whom Brunetti holds an (always gentlemanly) candle!<br />I found this story really interesting, set as it is on one of the outer islands of Venice, away from the usual tourist haunts.	2004-04-04

That book was a personal journey - a quest for answers -  followed by the author after the death of her famous mountain climber boyfriend on the slopes of Everest.<br />This book looks at the effect of following this most dangerous of passions on the partners left behind and some who sometimes accompany their loved ones. Even more interestingly, Maria Coffey looks at the point of views of those who have no choice in their relationships with those whose addiction seems as self-serving and as inevitable as any other addiction - parents and children.<br />I really liked Coffey's earlier book, and I recommend this one as much. I believe she has matured as a writer as well. She has the knack of addressing very large picture issues yet not losing sight of the personal and `small moments'.<br />Some of the personal testimonies about coming to terms with loss and dealing with grief are true not only for losses under such circumstances, but there are some universal truths particularly for anyone who has had to deal with death and the \\"loss of a future\\", rather than a mere celebration of a life fulfilled (as many older person funerals have become in my culture in recent years).<br />An understated but important subtext for me is what this has to say about gender relations. It is no accident that most of those off risking their lives, and the fur=tures of those around them are male. Ms Coffey does touch on this, and especially the unusual circumstance of women with children who still pursue the apex of whatever mass of rock and ice they have their heart set on. However, she never table thumps an agenda . . . you are lft to ponder your own conclusions.<br />A remarkable achievement.That Ms Coffey has the confidence of so many associated with the pursuit is a testament to her insight and empathy.<br />I rate this alongside Ed Douglas's book &quot;Chomolungma Sings The Blues&quot; as my favourite books discussing ethical and spititual concerns about mountaineering.cal and spititual concerns about mountaineering.	2004-04-04

I found the chapter on homosexuality in Florence interesting, but a tiny phrase let it down. In the lesser space accorded the lesbian population, Mrs George Keppel is described as the mother of \\"yet another\\" lesbian. As if by there being four or five renowned lesbian inhabitants amongst the far more numerous gay males, they were forming a disproportionately large segment of the population! I found that quite odd.<br />I also found it difficult to reconcile Leavitt's bitchiness about the lack of contact the earlier generations of ex-pats had with the locals (to the point of \\"like many\\" not knowing any Italian) with the lack of presence of any contemporary Florentines in his narrative, given that he is a part-time resident himself.<br />I loved the chapter about the \\"mud angels\\", brief as it was, and would have enjoyed more about the relationship between locals and expats alike with the art of this wonderful city.<br />Having said all that, I did enjoy the book overall and it is a welcome addition to the background literature of Italy which I read voraciously.	2004-01-26

I bought this book with the intention of doing some self-guided study to &quot;brush up&quot;. It is absolutely perfect for that use.<br />Each short lesson is followed by numerous written exercises. All the answers are in the back (no peeking!)<br />The book would be a useful supplement for anyone learning Italian through other means - in a class, via audio or computer-based courses. It would give the curious a basic understanding of grammar, but would not be a useful single tool for achieving spoken fluency or comprehension as it does not involve listening or speaking.<br />But for those in my situation, it is perfect, and much cheaper than buying a full grammar text and/or audio course, much of which you might not need.	2003-08-13

Set mostly in the Annapolis Valley, and partly in Halifax, I felt Conlin drew word pictures of the area and its people that rang very true. The student life in Halifax came to life, as I enjoyed the vibrant and youthful pub scene in Halifax (I am old enough to be those students' parent but the scene was so age-mixed it was very welcoming).<br />Like most early novels, this one seems to have more than a touch of autobiography. Apart from the truthfulness of the setting, Conlin has really got to the heart of the depression and aloneness of the young who stand somewhat apart from the mores and values of theur family. The tensions within family, where there is often unstated, but overwhelming love which somehow just isn't adequately communicated, was painful, raw, and honest.<br />A growing-up story by a young writer who is a real talent.  Melancholy (as I find much Canadian literature to be) but ultimately a book of hope.	2003-06-21

Paris is bursting with modern architecture, from grand projets of successive Presidents, Mayors and other public authorities, to smaller, more intimate and local projects.<br />This book is a lovely exposition of some of the most interesting (if not always beautiful, or welcomed) architecture of the past couple of decades.<br />The black and white photograps enhance the text and add great mood. The text is interesting, sometimes very opinionated (you probably won't agree with all the opinions - but it will perhaps challenge some of your assumptions).<br />Discover how, after heavy criticism of the then proposed glass pyramid and massive underground entrance to the Louvre, critics came to be won over when a fullscale model was erected. The daring of Parisian projects has brought us the sublime - the aforementioned Louvre entrance, and the vile - Les Halles, for example.<br />The book is written so that you need have no background in architecture to find it thought-provoking, interesting and very, very readable.<br />I left it at home when I recently visited Paris (well you can't take everything), but enjoyed delving into it again as soon as I returned. If you can fit it in your luggage, it would be a great companion.	2003-06-21

The only better map is the No 2 Plan to public transport available free from Metro stations, which shows metro , RER and bus routes with named streets, and the more expensive book maps by arrondissement available in Paris.<br />But unless you want to cart around two books, the maps in this volume are excellent (warning: there are a few places they DON'T cover, so if you are planning visits to some of the less touristed arrondissements, you will need a map book as well).<br />I used this in conjunction with Fodor's Around Paris With Kids, and together they covered everything we needed as a family.<br />The house style of Eyewitness Guides is now well-known, and this volume is as good as, if not better, than any.

HOLT'S BATTLEFIELD GUIDE TO THE SOMME	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Excellent companion	I have just returned from a 5 day visit to the Somme (May 2003), and found his book an indispensible guide if you are doing it on your own.<br />You need to sit down and study the key to the accompanying map quite carefully. Once you have got the hang of it, and the references in the book, your journey will be much smoother.<br />There are so MANY memorials, graves and sites of remembrance in this area, that it would be virtually impossible to visit everything. Many people (like me) will have a personal reason for visiting - a relative who fought, maybe was killed there.<br />My advice is to do as much research as possible first, and you can do worse that start by reading the introduction to this book. Stroll through the book and become familiar with some of the places it describes. I had a particular interest in Australian-oriented memorials. In the latest edition these are paid quite close attention. However, you need to piece together your own &quot;Australian tour&quot; (the Franco-Australian museum in Villers-Brettoneux can help too).<br />Still, it was quite easy with this guide - one read through and I compiled my own list from it.<br />The more generalist visitor I would recommend starting with the Historial in Peronne, which is well described in the book...but not as a starting point. The book is oriented towards Britons with a car coming from across the channel, which is no doubt the promary audience, but the &quot;approaches&quot; section cannot be followed if one is arriving, for example from the direction od Paris.<br />Nevertheless, with a bit of flicking back and forth and some sticky-paper notes, this is an excellent resource from which to plan an independent tour.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-21

As a rather nervous visitor to the area (not without reason - there was a drive by killing of an 11 year old outside a church the same day) I was absolutely glued to this book.<br />I love the LA noir genre of detective fiction. This is very different, and offers far more insight into WHY LA is as it is. It takes us to other parts of LA - the more middleclass areas of West LA (where I was staying), for example.<br />This book is a riveting story, and it deftly juggles the historical context and so achieves so much 'explanation' and 'history' in a naturalistic way.<br />It also, most importantly of all, offers hope (which, by contrast, noir fiction rarely does)	2003-06-21

This was the experience many an armchair-Everesteer would wish for themselves, I am sure;<br />* The journalist's view of the people involved - all the other accounts I have read have been written from the point of view of being 'insiders' in the ecpedition - Hunt, Hillary, Tenzing, for example<br />* The mechanics of how Morris set up 'exclusive' media coverage from the mountain!

I think of Scott Fischer - the gungho boys-own daredevil with whom she had an unsuccessful attempt on Everest and with whom she worked. It provides rather an interesting insight into the character of someone who died in the infamous 1996 storms on Everest so vividly depicted in many books, most notably, Jon Krakeur's Into Thin Air.<br />Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but from Allison's portrayal, it's almost a case of &quot;No wonder!&quot;	2003-02-22

The largest, and first, section, is an account of events in Afghanistan, which he has witnessed first-hand as a foreign correspondent.<br />This book is no dry history, nor is it merely a travelogue, nor is it merely an extended piece of journalism.<br />Kremmer comes to know and befriend people of different backgrounds within the region, and it is their stories, as well as the carpet trade and stories of emblematic carpets, through which the narrative is woven. We care about the future of the peoples of the region, because we care about what becomes of Kremmer's friends.<br />What Christopher has managed to do is to make the internecine politics, the inhumanities, the brutalities, comprehensible, through his humanisation of peoples who might in lesser hands be reduced to the merely 'exotic' or even worse 'unknowable and inhuman'.<br />Earlier this year I read 'Unexpected Light: Travels in Afghanistan' by Jason Elliot.<br />I thoroughly recommend both these books if you desire to reach some understanding of a region of such importance to us all.	2002-12-07

I was fascinated by the observations and experiences Elliot has with the very severe and serious looking Afghans in front of the camera, and the warmth and hospitality and cheerfulness he encounters.<br />It was quite chilling when he was trying to get to Bamiyan, a feat he never achieved...and thinking about the loss of those statues under the Taliban. Also the description of the glories of the mosque/medresse at Herat, counterpoised with the reality when he gets there. I just cannot imagine what Afghanistan looked like - would love to see some pictures of it in its glorious past. We see so many images now of rubble and destruction, I can't imagine the avenues of trees and beautiful gardens that once were, but Elliot's word pictures help.<br />However, Elliot's sory is, by necessity, half the story only. Elliot, as a man, can only interact with men during his journeys. This is not, of course, Elliot's fault. I got the feeling in quite a few places that Elliot was startlingly comfortable with all the male company, and hardly missed the company of women. When he was in women's company he was only ever able to objectify them. His reaction to the attractive Afghan woman he encountered (Herat?) was but one example. At the expat gatherings it was the same, and the foreign journalists he usually had something, if not disparaging, then at least arch, to say about them.<br />I do think at times he might be prone to romanticising those with whom he seems to have most sympathy - the mujahadeen of the north. Plenty is known about the atrocities they have been involved with over the years, and organisations like RAWA certainly have no more time for them than the Taleban. He certainly lionises the Northern Alliance, the mujahadeen - it is obvious his sympathies lie with them, which is understandable, seeing as he was with them and also the Soviet occupation was untenable and vile. Nevertheless, we know that the alliance were no saints at all, and we get no sense of that.<br />While I found all his journeys interesting, I loved the section in the latter part of the book about Herat the best. It was the only place where he met resistance and suspicion from the ex-pats (the Swiss and French aid workers), and where he met the most \\"interesting\\" non-Afghans, especially the Christian missionaries.<br />Then there was the English couple and their children in the village north of Heart. I would love to have known a bit more about them and their motivations.<br />But best of all was when he visited the shrine and stayed the night with the sufis and the descriptions of the Talebs who came along making their noises of - ecstacy? reverie?<br />This was also the scene of the only time where I felt that he felt any real fear. The tension when he was having to dash back to the missionaries after he had been thrown out of the aid place was real.<br />The footnote on p 254 is really interesting and has made me conscious of the phenomenon he describes every time an item comes on TV about countries where Muslims are the majority: the image of Moslems at prayer. He's right! It does accompany nearly every single news item - those bums raised in the air! And imagine if every time there was an item about, say Northern Ireland, it was accompanied by an image of Caholics genuflecting! Absurd, we would think. As he says it: \\"I have sometimes wondered what the Moslem interpretation might be of news reports of the West if they always began the footage of glum faces filing into churches in their Sunday best in order to drink the blood of a human God.\\"<br />Recommended.y lionises the Northern Alliance, the mujahadeen - it is obvious his sympathies lie with them, which is understandable, seeing as he was with them and also the Soviet occupation was untenable and vile.

If you are looking for maps (other than a Metro and RER railway map inside the back cover and the walking maps) and colour pictures you are advised to look elsewhere.<br />After opening chapters looking at `Paris in a Weekend' ,practicalities,  history, art and architecture and several short pieces on topics such as dog poo and modernism (well worth reading  - very entertaining, but make sure your spectacles prescription is up to date - the print in this section is very small!), the guide really gets into its strength.<br />The bulk of the book is built around 11 different walks, in 11 different neighbourhoods. All are thoroughly described with an accompanying easy-to-follow black and white map. Each walk has an indication of how long it will take (excluding museum visits), suggestions for restaurants and cafes on the route and comprehensive information on the sites.<br />This makes the book perfect for a visitor spending an extended time in Paris, who wants to discover the city the best way possible, or for the repeat visitor who has the good fortune to be able to return to Paris time and again.<br />After the Walks, the museums of Paris are listed and cross-referenced to where they occur in the Walks text. The Louvre and Musee d'Orsay are described at length. A section then follows on peripheral attractions - lying further afield than central Paris. There are listings for restaurants, accommodation and nightlife venues.<br />The writing in Cadogans tends towards the opinionated, witty, slightly ironic (but not smart-alec) and drily understated British style. It appeals to me in the same way as Rough Guides do.<br />This is not a book for the first-time short-term visitor intending to see the \\"Top Five\\" and then move on. There are plenty of other guides catering to that market, and fulfilling their brief admirably (try Rick Steves, Let's Go, Frommer, Lonely Planet for example). But if you want a book with some substance and detail which will be just as rewarding a read back at your hotel as accompanying you on your on-foot rambles around this beautiful city, then I can't recommend it highly enough.example).

There are 8 chapters, covering Architecture, Art, Fashion, Festivals and Religion, Food and Drink, Music, Sports and Leisure, Theatre. Lavishly illustrated, and designed in a very modern way, it is a really interesting look at various cultural traditions and the people that make up modern London. It gives you a real feel for the vibrancy of compolitan, multicultural, multiethnic, multifaith nature of London, rather than an anodyne view of \\"little white Englanders\\".<br />Not a travel guide, but a book anyone planning a trip would find interesting, or anyone interested in this great city.	2002-11-09

I do not fall into that category, , but am aware of her enduring presence as an icon. This book lived up to its intriguing promise of providing ANOTHER viewpoint about Marilyn &#150; other than the myriad biographies which have been about Marilyn by &#145;outsiders&#146; and those enriching themselves on the proceeds.<br />This is very much the biography of Norma Jean Baker as she came to be known by her sister.<br />The picture of &#145;private Marilyn&#146;  depicted here does an enormous amount to restore Marilyn&#146;s humanity, her connection with her family and peers, the person behind the impenetrable Goddess Icon that she has become in the decades since her death. This is the uncommodified, unexploited Marilyn, a person who loved and was loved. It&#146;s a great corrective to the hagiographic or shallow tendencies of most Marilyn-abilia and I thoroughly recommend it.	2002-11-09

That doesn't make it easy, but for eighty percent of the book I was captivated by both the story and the writing.<br />The use of Indian terms or colloquialisms, endearments was a bit frustrating and meant I was distanced from the culture being depicted not only by non-membership, but through language.<br />But still, there are other places where the Indianness is hilarious and a testament to Rushdies skills at evoking images.  There is a  description of the \\"actress with a mountain of fruit on her head\\" in the pictures in a peepshow  ... \\"Lifafa called her Carmen Verandah\\" Verandah is a word which has found its way into English from India, and this verbal joke about a Latin American actress is lovely.<br />Coming from a country where the verandah was adopted as part of the architectural vernacular, I have an uncommon fondness for verandahs, both the word and the concept!<br />Then I  got to within 80 pages of the end, and just couldn't get excited about finishing it. Somehow,  I didnt really care any more.<br />The best part of the storytelling was when Saleem was a child; somehow events filtred through childhood seemed more compelling.<br />There is loads of symbolism; much of it just washed over me. I think Rushdie is a fine storyteller in his best passages, but other times merely pretentious.<br />Absolutely worth reading, but I think it might encompass too great a time span, and be flawed for that	2002-11-09

There are sections on the main tourist areas of he city, eg the Latin Quarter, which include the attractions most likely to appeal to children (never neglecting the `Big Sites'), including museums, and especially parks and playgrounds, shopping relevant to kids, and best of all, family friendly eating places in each quarter, including opening hours, an indication of price, and some specialties/type of fare.<br />There are sections on entertainment, sports and activities, shopping, eating and sleeping. One useful chapter is on `Themed' days out - eg On the trail of the French Revolution, Paris from below, Paris from above - always with food stop suggestions.<br />The latter part of the book is devoted to Disneyland Paris, which provides comprehensive information if you are planning to visit there.<br />One negative: the maps aren't all that useful for actual navigation. They do give an indication of the relative location of different places of interest in each geographical area, and show metro locations so are useful for planning your itinerary. But the streets are not named and you may need an accompanying, more comprehensive map.<br />No hesitation about recommending this book, and I am using it in conjunction with Fodor's Around Paris With Kids (reviewed elsewhere).	2002-11-09

Likely to appeal to anyone who has a fondness for English stories set in the pre to post World War Two period, with the lush rendering of upper middle-class country house life.<br />More than just a family saga, it explores some universal themes of truth, forgiveness, loyalty, redemption.<br />Th narrative is divided in three parts, closely resembling 3 linked novellas, but each is in fact dependent on the other for the resolution - although even there the author teases with a denouement that takes this into the realm of unresolved fantasy (popular amongst movie-makers nowadays - from Memento to Mulholland Drive, though personally I think the clues are well enough laid by McEwan that it is a little less ambiguous than some).<br />For me, the second section, recounting the story of one main character and another in the retreat from France that culminated in Dunkirk, is the strongest component. The evocation of that aspect of war - the fleeing columns of humanity being aerially strafed by the German forces is different to anything else of have read set in wartime.<br />A satisfying and not difficult read for those who like something lyrical and literary.	2002-11-09

There just is not much available for the traveller, resident or person with a general interest in the Aboriginal heritage of Australia's first city, as well as modern Aboriginal culture.<br />The first chapter is an Introduction which gives a very brief, but good overview of pre-European Aboriginal presence in the area now known as Sydney, as well as post 1788 survival and communities.<br />The rest of the book is arranged according to geographical areas and sites within each. Many are well and truly on the well-beaten tourist path, such as Bennelong Point, where the Opera House sits. Others are a little less known or visited, such as the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre in western Sydney.<br />Each site has information about getting there, both by private vehicle and public transport, hours, admission, contact phone no, facilities, and location on the most popular Sydney street directory (Gregory's) as well as a brief description and more detailed information. Includes beautiful colour photos by Aboriginal photographer Alana Harris.<br />Also interspersed in the relevant places, is text relating to a wide range of significant events, people and places.<br />I think this book has a place in every Sydney-sider's home. It helps non_Aboriginal people to better appreciate the land and places they have come to. It would also be invaluable for any visitor, as this type of info is just not found in this detail in generalist guides books.	2002-11-09

Nothing glossy, no photos, no pictures at all. I have borrowed all the glossy stuff from the library to read ahead of time, and anything useful have put as margin notes in THIS book, because this is the one I plan to have along. It tells you how to get to each place, opening hours, what to see and do there. Includes information on attractions especially for kids, as well as all the conventional tourist sites, museums etc, emphasising the aspects that are most likely to appeal to kids.<br />If you are a first-time visitor to London you may feel more comfortable having a good, conventional guide book along as well, but if you don't need the basics AND you have children along with you, I reckon you'll want to have this book above all others.	2002-11-09

Provides and overview of materials and then has several projects within the categories of Tile Decoration, Making Tiles and Working with tiles.

The section on Making Tiles has good instructions for making your own tiles with different types of clay, all of which are explained, as are different types of firing and kilns, glazing and slips and the use of plaster moulds. It then goes on to give step by step instructions for making: slabbed tiles, rolled tiles, open face molded tiles, making and decorating paper clay tiles, extruded tiles, press molded tiles, slip cast tiles.

The artists represented include  Monet, Cezanne, Renoir, Seurat, Gauguin, Manet, Signac and Pissarro.<br />But this book is not merely a catalogue - it stands alone as an excellent and readable book about the artistic and social worlds of the artists. The essays are interesting and mercifully free of inaccessible jargon, so the generalist really can learn something about the context of the Impressionist movement, the paintings themselves and the artists.<br />An example: the opening of the  essay `The Impressionist Landscape and the Image of France: \\" When the Impressionists began to paint the French landscape in the 1860s, they were not alone. Several satirical writers had already counted more landscape painters than tourists or peasants in their travels through the French countryside, and the official Salon exhibitions held annually in Paris were all  but dominated by French landscapes. Books and manuals about landscape painting for both amateur and professional artists abounded, and if there was a national genre in French art, it was surely landscape. The painters were joined by a legion of printmakers, draftsmen, and popular illustrators in an almost frantic collective attempt to record the national physiognamy.\\"<br />The essays are:<br />`Impressionism in Context' - includes information on the conception of the exhibition, the grouping of paintings etc; `The Impressionist Landscape and the Image of France' (extract above) which includes reference to contemporaneous politics, writing, national movements such as rejection of historical France, the concept of nature of the Impressionsts etc; `The French Landscape Sensibility'; `The Cradle of Impressionism' - about the Seine landscape and villages; `The Urban Landscape' - Paris; ` Rivers, Roads and Trains'; `Pissarro, Cezanne and the School of Pontoise'; `Private and Public Gardens'; `The Fields of France' (lots of haystacks!); `Impressionism and the Sea'; `The Retreat from Paris'; `Impressionism and the Popular Imagination'. An appendix essay is `The Landscape in French Nineteenth-Century Photography'. The paintings are grouped under each of the themes represented by the essays.<br />Another standout feature of the book is the amount of contextual detail accompanying each work of art. So, for example, the first work presented is Beach at Honfleur by Claude Monet. The colour reproduction is good quality, and takes a full page. The accompanying text on the facing page explains what Monet was doing , how the painting came to be painted.<br />A marvellous book, a valuable addition to any personal library. I would place it in the `must have' category for an art collection in a secondary school or college library where Art is a course of study, and public libraries -  because of its simultaneous accessibility and depth of information - it goes so much further than a book merely of reproductions.Pontoise'; `Private and Public Gardens'; `The Fields of France' (lots of haystacks!); `Impressionism and the Sea'; `The Retreat from Paris'; `Impressionism and the Popular Imagination'.

The book is certainly scholarly (the footnotes themselves make great reading), and it takes some effort to read. This is no booster-like `fable' about LA.<br />Interestingly, Davis is a Marxist, and I have not often come across mainstream works by Americans in that political tradition, and that in itself would, for some, make it worth reading. However, ultimately I was a little disappointed in the book in light of first having read Norman Klein's `The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory' (see review under that title).<br />In the end I find Davis's view unrelentingly bleak. He has no time for urban renewal projects, dismissing them as furthering the interests merely of the middle class and the powerful. Klein by contrast lives in a mixed suburb close to downtown (Angelino Heights) and is enthusiastic about the possibilities thrown up by his experiences there. Davis, I have read, lives in the uppermiddle class enclave of Pasadena.<br />I agree with Davis's thesis that empowerment and placing decision-making directly in the hands of the dispossessed will ultimately provide the way out, but I felt he was just a bit too dismissive (sneering? Perhaps too strong a word...) of the emergent black middle class, and the desire to escape the `flatlands' - the neighbourhoods in southern LA created through blatant racism and apartheid-like policies.<br />As for the new barrios of the San Fernando Valley, surely the whole community is ultimately going to have to be involved in finding solutions if the apocolypse is to be avoided. Occasionally I get the feeling Davis would prefer the `scorched earth' solution.<br />There is a lot to be learned from this book. As an outsider, I was astounded by the social geographic history of this city. Race covenants preventing people from ling in designated towns, suburbs, streets, houses were a stark form of apartheid. The brutality of the LAPD is equally as stark, and a good reminder to a person brought up on a steady diet of Hollywood sitcom and cop shows that reality is far uglier than the image.<br />Yet, the other global image of LA, as a hell-hole of crime and no-go ghettos (no go to outsiders) is scarily depicted as well. I did experience visiting an LA school in a tough neighbourhood, where armed guard security officers checked you in and out, and jail-like walls surrounded the campus (happily, once inside though, it was a very calm and normal environment). I am not blinkered about the awful side of LA, but I think Davis is altogether too nihilistic.<br />Nevertheles, I would highly recommend this book for a thought-provoking readated towns, suburbs, streets, houses were a stark form of apartheid.

Each section includes readable essays on the particular exhibition, and reproductions of and notes on the paintings represented in the San Francisco/ Washington exhibition , as well as reproductions of the catalogs of the original Impressionist exhibitions.<br />The quality of reproductions is very high, given the limitations of still enabling the book to remain affordable to the generalist reader.<br />There is a wealth of detail in this comprehensive work.

I am sure it fulfils that roile admirably. However, from the point of view of the generalist reader looking for something `meaty' on the subject of American cities, I can't really recommend it.<br />It is full of rather dry statistics and facts. I was particularly interested in Los Angeles, and the book did provide some very useful background information, but it left me unsatisfied - I didn't come away with a `feel' for the city in any human sense.<br />For a more passionate account of Los Angeles, still in a scholarly work, I can recommend `The History of Forgetting' by Norman Klein.<br />Please don't feel I don't think this book isn't useful within its context, but if you are looking for something scholarly yet with some passion, you may well be disappointed in this book.	2002-11-08

I am glad I read this one first. It is a well-documented and scholarly book, yet full of passion and feeling about the City of the Angels. It focuses almost exclusively on `Downtown', whereas Davis's book ranges more widely.<br />I was left in no doubt about Klein's feeling for that part of LA - he lives in Anegelino Heights - the first suburb just north of Downtown. Klein brings to life through personal anecdote the vitality and multiculturalism (and problems) of his, and other neighbourhoods.<br />You get to boo and hiss at the villains who have alienated greater LA from its Downtown, but you also get a sense of Klein's affection, and sense of hope for the city.Davis's view is much bleaker and perhaps nihilistic - he rails against the racism upon which LA is foundered, and upon which the powerful thrive, but I note in passing that he lives in the uppermiddle class enclave of Pasadena. Klein, on the other hand (at least at the time of writing) remains part of the inner urban fabric of the city. I get the feeling that Klein is a supporter of urban renewal, whereas Davis views it as another alienating con on the part of City Hall.<br />I agree with a previous reviewer that the novella within the book doesn't quite work. I think it contains the seeds of a good story in another genre, but is misplaced here. One problem may be the attempt to speak in a voice for which he has respect, but which is not his.<br />If you are interested in all things LA, film and fictive noir, the great upheavals and crises of a city such as the Rodney King affair and the LAPD, apocalyptic LA, and more - all of which  penetrate the consciousness of many way way beyond the city (through globalised media, which is part of the fabric of LA) , then you will be enthralled by this book. Read it alongside Davis, by all means, but don't neglect it in favour of Davis!<br />If you like discussion of film and fiction set in LA, there is lots in this book to ponder.<br />Note: Klein cites Davis in his work. I have not seen Klein cited in any work of Davis (understandable in City of Quartz, which predates Klein's work, but he also does not appear in the index for Davis's later work Ecology of Fear - which at the time of writing this I have not yet read)n of film and fiction set in LA, there is lots in this book to ponder. <br />Note: Klein cites Davis in his work.

I have used the section on the coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco for planning a driving trip.

It is also one of the most honest accounts of young adulthood - almost shocking in its candour. And every word was integral to the web of understanding which the author was trying to enmesh us in (successfully).<br />A masterpiece. If you like Ellroy, or are fascinated by the psychology of the impact of a crime like murder, this is a must-read.	2002-10-09

Anyone who remembers the early days of the AIDS crisis in western countries will remember the misinformation, the 'witch hunt' aspects, the manifestations of ignorance. In my country a little girl was banished from kindergarten by a braying mob, for example. She was forced to retreat with her family to another country (New Zealand) to escape the oprobrium. I couldn't help thinking of this as I read this novel.<br />Brooks has been very skilful in her use of language, and I found it poetic and lyrical...she has managed to give an IMPRESSION of the use of language as it may have been. However, it would not have been wholly like that - for a start it was a remote corner of a remote northern outreach of England. Nevertheless Brooks has managed to make it sound uncontrived (most of the time - there were a few lapses where it started to sound a bit self-conscious). In the same vein, the author's point of view, as it emerges through the central character, is never less than anachronistic - she displays attitudes that are those of a 21st century woman. I don't think that is a problem - I think authors are alloed to use historical fiction genre in order to express contemporary viewpoints.<br />What disappointed me most was the final chapter. I think it lets down the rest of the book. Don't let that stop you reading it, but I you are a fan of the more breathless bodice-ripping romance genre, you won't be disappointed! I feel a far less unconventional future for the main protagonist would have been truer to the character and the times.	2002-09-12

But it is the most comprehensive, most insightful, and ultimately most helpful.<br />The Time Out Guide is also very good, especially its listings section, some interesting background, terrific colour maps (complete with street index), and nice pics and Lonely Planet looks more than adequate, but it is Rough Guide I am most impressed with.<br />That is because of the depth of information on many places. There are really clear black &amp; white maps of the layouts of things like the Basilica and Doge's Palace, and sestiere maps. I decided this is the guide I want to read at night or in a quiet corner when actually visiting places.	2002-09-12

We used it extensively in planning a trip to Paris with our 9 year old son, and it was amongst the first things packed. The information is useful, the size is wholly convenient. Nothing glossy, no photos, no pictures at all. I have borrowed all the glossy stuff from the library to read ahead of time, and anything useful have put as margin notes in THIS book, because this is the one I plan to have along. It tells you how to get to each place, opening hours, what to see and do there. Includes information on attractions especially for kids, as well as all the conventional tourist sites, museums etc, emphasising the aspects that are most likely to appeal to kids. It tells you which parks in Paris kids can run and play on grass - that alone has to be worth its weight in gold.<br />If you are a first-time visitor to Paris you may feel more comfortable having a good, conventional guide book along as well, but if you don't need the basics (such as how to buy a metro ticket etc) AND you have children along with you, I reckon you'll want to have this book above all others.	2002-09-12

The malevolent presence of Dudley Smith is omnipresent - even when he's not in a scene, he's present. You can imagine his skulking, shadowy presence all the time.<br />There is no clear definition of a 'goodie' or 'baddie' in an Ellroy characterisation. Some of the fringe characters seem to get away with being decent (and one-dimensional), but they are only there to serve other purposes when necessary to tie the plot together. I described The Big Nowhere as a roller coaster ride, and the necessity to get into the language rhythm. I suspect this is a matter of coming to terms with Ellroy's style - once mastered it's not such a big deal. For that reason, this book didn't leave me quite so breathless, but I suspect it may have done if this was my starting point.<br />Once again, don't read it if you are squeamish about the bizarre  and often distasteful things humans can do to one another. Not for the sanctimonious who don't want to believe ill of those we entrust with policing human excess either - the keepers are often as perverted as the kept!<br />But a terrific action-packed rise on the sleazy and seamy side of one of the great 20th century cities. LA is one of the stars of this, as with other Ellroy volumes. I can see those tract houses in 'The Valley' as they would have been in the 50s. And I haven't seen the movie!	2002-09-12

In many ways I think it is the best, most especially the final chapter, when one era segues into the next, as generational change occurs.<br />It is probably a particular type of reader who enjoys fiction which examines the drawing room manners and social mores of  upper middle class England (the professional class, as opposed to manufacturing/merchant class or aristocracy). I love it, especially when it is delivered with an archly raised eyebrow which questions the assumptions and mores, the hypocrisies of the time. All the better if it can lead you to question the same characteristics of your own time. That is achieved in Galsworthy, in much the same way as Trollope achieved in his Barchester Chronicles in an earlier era.<br />The writing is not without humour, mostly of an ironic kind. The older generation Forsytes, steadfast in their belief in themselves find it almost inconceivable when one amongst their number has the termerity to die!<br />Anyone who thrives on a diet of Trollope, Thackeray, Austen, and anyone who has enjoyed Ian McEwan's more contemporary novel, Atonement should enjoy this. Lovers of the British TV 'costume drama' - think The Cazalets, Love In A Cold Climate, The Way We Live Now - for example, should likewise consider reading Galsworthy.	2002-09-12

It takes a while to sort out the parallel plot lines and keep the characters in an orderly arrangement in your head. I even went back and re-read the first 3 chapters after about ten, and re-established them for myself (after that it was all quite clear).<br />I suspect this is a matter of coming to terms with Ellroy's style - once mastered it's not such a big deal. For that reason, LA Confidential, the next book, didn't leave me quite so breathless, but I suspect it may have done if it has been my starting point.<br />Ellroy's setting may be 1950s Los Angeles, and homage may being paid to the noir detectives of earlier eras, but his writing - both language and themes - is graphically contemporary. It has as much to tell us about current values as anything, as well as exposing the corruption and nastiness of a previous era. As someone brought up on a diet rich in the Hollywood dream factory (Dragnet, Perry Mason, and family sitcoms depicting the 'sunny' side of urban America where cops were your friend, and the ranch house in the suburbs an unassailable good) I love this exposition of the seemier side of life - which as contemporary events - eg the Rodney King bashing - show us are no less real.<br />The story was of personal interest to me - the Grand Jury investigations into unions and Hollywood. The hard-bitten cynicism of several of the bad-guy heroes adds edge and bite to the historical facts.<br />Straight after closing the covers on The Big Nowhere, I started LA Confidential, the next in the LA Quartet. I liked it just as much.<br />There is no clear definition of a 'goodie' or 'baddie' in an Ellroy characterisation. Some of the fringe characters seem to get away with being decent (and one-dimensional), but they are only there to serve other purposes when necessary to tie the plot together.<br />Once again, don't read it if you are squeamish about the bizarre  and often distasteful things humans can do to one another.

It is a painfully realistic dissection of the internal dynamics and tensions of pretty ordinary family life, and the sort of value shifts that occurred in the latter half of the 20th century (at least in western, Americanised cultures, such as mine).<br />What I particularly liked was the shifting viewpoints; Franzen has managed to get into the subconscious, perhaps the soul of family relationships, and help us to understand the motivations, foibles and passions of very ordinary people - people who we can recognise, parts of whom it is not too difficult to imagine being able to see in ourselves.<br />I am especially interested in the relationship of adult children to their elderly parents (probably reflecting the stage of life I am at) and I think Franzen has written about this with poignancy, but without maudlin or schmaltzy excess, which may have been the result in a lesser writer's hands.<br />It is thoroughly contemporary, and at the same time explores some universal themes. The social mores and conventions may change over generations, but the need to examine them and hold them up to the light do not diminish. What Jane Austen achieved with 19th century social relationships in a certain cultural setting, so does Franzen.<br />It is also very funny in parts.<br />I recommend it without hesitation.	2002-09-12

It seems to be a stream of existentialist prose or somesuch, and lost me in its turgid non-plot.<br />I appreciate that many reviewers say they have got a lot from this book, but I would caution the generalist reader.<br />This book was chosen for my book club, and we all started it in good faith and tried to persist with it. I don't think anyone finished it. In fact at one stage I read out one or two of the more pretentious and portentous passages to my partner, and we ended up rolling around laughing at the meaningless gibberish posing as serious insight.

Have read many Everest books, and this is one which I would use to replace the acres of \\"management\\" and \\"team building\\" books cluttering up bookshops. (Perhaps one other: about Shackelton's leadership during his abortive Antarctic expedition).<br />This book is old-fashioned in values, and style. It is about unfashionable concepts such as: absence of personal glory ('me-ism'). In this successful endeavour, accomplishment does not depend on tearing down what has gone before, it does not emphasise \\"the power of one\\", rather the contributions and power of many.<br />It is redolent of : trust, enlightened leadership, graciousness, reliability, collective spirit and ability.<br />I found fascinating the detail of how the \\"assault\\" was undertaken.<br />One quote which sums up the spirit of the venture:<br />\\" The mission we undertook was not, in our eyes, in the nature of some competition on a giant scale in which we vied to outdo the efforts of previous expeditions, dramatic and popular as such a concept might be. Indeed, prolonged attempts t climb a difficult mountain are, or should be, essentially different from those of a competitive sport. A possible analogy, however, might be that of a relay race, in which each member of a team of runners hands the baton to the next at tthe end of the allotted span, until the race is finally run. The Swiss last year received that baton of knowledge from the latest in the long chain of British climbers and they in turn, after running a brilliant lap, passed it on to us. We chanced to be the last runners in this particular race, but we might well not have succeeded in finishing, in which case we would have handed on our knowledge to our French comrades who were preparing to take up the challenge.\\"	2002-05-30

Both are fascinating, and tightly interwoven. Jon Karakaeur, in the book's forward, called it one the best of the books written after the 1996 season and tragedies on Everest. I think Krakauer, who wrote a gripping and compelling account himself, is correct. It tells the Sherpas' story of their relationship with the mountain brilliantly.<br />Much of it is very similar in text to Broughton Coburn's &quot;Everest: Mountain Without Mercy&quot;, the official book of the IMAX filming expedition, of which Jamling was a team member. Yet it offers a more personal account well worth reading.	2002-05-18

At first this book reminded me of Carol Shields' &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot;. The first section, the story of Davis and Margaret was written in a spare, even cold fashion. I never got a real feeling for their relationship. To me, it was detached and not terribly involving. The book gained emotional momentum as it continued, to the point where the last section was like a full-blown &quot;women's weepie&quot;, the sort of book that has gold-embossed covers and is a blockbuster family saga.<br />I like this book, but wouldn't place it in my canon of 'great books' because I don't think it had anything particularly profound or even original to say. Its examination of grief in the final section, and the relationship between parent and children is territory familiar to readers of Anita Shreve's 'The Pilot's Wife'. Why does everyone die so young? This is one of those books where the 'tragedies' are signalled right from the beginning, and where if happiness and contentment is a character's lot, then it will be snatched away very soon via death.<br />I also do not think that the cover blurb asserting it has so much to say about migration is true. Migration in this book is wholly linked with a personal need to place distance between oneself as an emerging adult and one's parents, or the milieu of one's parent/s. That is but one motivation for migration, and certainly debatable whether it is a majority motivation. Economic and political circumstances are never a factor, whereas I would suggest they are in 'real life'.<br />This book is unchallenging and undemanding, a 'good read' for a quiet weekend or a plane journey (unless you are prone to tears when characters die and don't want to cry in public!).	2001-07-17

Sick of the psychobabble approach to the search for meaning indulged in by western hippies and dilettantes? Then this is the book for you. If you remain sceptically detached, then Mehta's bull's-excrement detector will appeal to you. In a world where 'altenatives' are equally as brand-labelled as major corporate product, Mehta turns the heat on the dipsomaniacs and freaks who are so successfully sucked in by the tricksters and con merchants in the great supermarket of 'religious experiences' that India (her country) offers.<br />The book is witty and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, as well as a cautionary tale for those who might be flirting with the cults (who probably wouldn't listen anyway).	2001-07-17

For a start,  Gopnik writes really well, both elegantly and with great humour.  He was the Paris correspondent for New Yorker magazine for the five years covered in this book. What sets it apart is his ability to weigh and measure his own prejudices and cultural biases, and, whilst not always wholeheartedly agreeing with the Parisian approach and attitude, he never condemns.<br />The essays appeared originally in &quot;New Yorker&quot;, so if you are a fan you will be pleased to see them in collected form. If, like me, you have never read them before the insightful observations and intelligent writing will capture you. The book seems to be ordered chrnologically, and at the end of each section is a 'Christmas diary' with observations and 'lessons learned' from the previous year.<br />I was particularly attracted to this book because of the promise of some insight into living life in an adopted city with a young child. This promise is delivered and provides a delightfully different insight than that offered by a Mayle or Mayes (well off later-life part-time emigres).	2001-07-17

It is the best place to start when planning a trip, and would be an essential companion for dipping in and out of whilst in Paris.<br />I must admit to being a bit of a factoid-monger myself, and Ms Keppner's disarmingly honest account of her own proclivities (even to the extent that her husband must make sure his friend is in Paris when they travel together because Barrie drives him a bit nuts!!!) is really nice.<br />The bibliographies after each section are fantastic and will provide a rich diet (and many library visits!).

It has often been suggested that mountaineers (mostly,but not exclusively men) are completely ego-centric beings, lacking in some capacity, unable to form relationships which have primacy in their lives. That most certainly seems to be, or have been, the case with Mr Weathers.<br />This is not a book for someone just interested in derry-doing and gonzo activities, though the first part of the book is an excellent account of the &quot;miraculous survival&quot; we have learned about from various other books, and an account of &quot;what happened next&quot;.<br />I enjoyed the way the book was structured with the other voices added at various times. Mr Weathers survived and was able to set down his story. In another book I loved, &quot;The Fragile Edge&quot; by Maria Coffey we hear about the destructive nature of this sport on intimate relationships, the devastation left behind, but because her partner and his friend died, we don't have the benefit of their thoughts on the matter.<br />I agree with the reviewers who said that Mr Weathers was fortunate in the extreme to have both the money and the political connections to be able to take off as he did, and be brought back. If people with lesser means and less social standing than a rich pathologist abandon their families, then they are condemned for following dreams , chasing windmills.<br />It is my personal belief that there is something quite odd about people who feel they have to conquer nature in this way - people are NOT meant to be hauling themselves into death zones! It is fundamentally selfish. I thank Mr Weathers for his honesty. I know I would not have liked him, but am glad that he survived to tell his story and make a scond chance with his family.	2001-06-03

Women artists were leaders in the Modernist movement in Australia between the two World Wars. This books looks at two, whose lives are like a mirror image of each other, Stella Bowen and Grace Cossington Smith. More than a straightforward biography, it addresses the dilemma of love and art. Do women have to sacrifice one for the other?<br />Modjeska's motif is a story she first heard from a friend. She says: &quot;It isn't much of a story, simply that when Stravinsky was in mid-composition, he insisted that his family ate lunch in silence. The slightest sound, a murmur, even a whisper, could ruin his concentration and destroy an entire work.&quot;<br />&quot;It's not a particularly unusual story - great male artists have demanded more than that in the name of Art - and yet it has worked on me, and in me, in ways that it has taken me a long time to understand. What began, for me, as an argument has become taken into my life as a kind of meditation.&quot;<br />At the time Bowen and Smith were developing as artists, Virginia Woolf was writing that in order for a woman to succeed as an artist she needed A Room Of One's Own and 500 pounds a year - ie an income sufficient for self-support.<br />Stella Bowen was born in 1893, Grace Cossington Smith in 1892. They led extremely different lives. Bowen went to europe, met and fell in love with a writer, Ford Madox Ford, spent a decade keeping house for him, and raising their child (which she continued to do after they separated). She lived in England and France from the evee of WW1, and never returned to Australia. Smith, on the other hand, lived for most of her life in a (then) semi-rural, outer suburb of Sydeny, bucolicly middle-class. She had the financial support of her encouraging family, who facilitated her art. One sister remained unmarried, and for most of the time kept house.<br />Modjeska said in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald:<br />&quot;It is very tough to be a woman and an artist. It has always been tough to be a woman and an artist. I have had a pretty good run as a writer, but even I have tasted enough of it to know what it has been like for women before. Life intrudes. Love intrudes. Women don't seem to be able to separate the two, women don't seem to be permitted to separate the two, like the blokes are able to do. And what is interesting, the more I explored this, the more I realised that women are complicit in the whole thing, too. The whole question became very complex.&quot;<br />The book is beautifully illustrated, with colour plates that are a pleasurable enhancement to the text. It is an engrossing and highly engaging read.tough to be a woman and an artist.

I know this review will result in a whole heap of &quot;No It Wasn't Helpful&quot; votes, because I am going against the trend!<br />Just as I hated Jonathan Livingston Seagull when I was a teenager, I hate this book now! No, hate is too strong a word for this piece of insignificant and shallow tripe. In every generation along comes an over-hyped meditation which is nothing more than New Age, melange-religion twaddle. And this is the one for now.<br />And it's way over-priced.<br />Disappointingly, it's by the author of one of my favourite books of the past couple of years (Veronika Decides To Die) .<br />Personal Legends sound like some of advertising industry hype for the latest inspiration for how You Too Can Be President, or how You Too Can Win A Gold Medal at the Olympics.<br />But when I got to this nonsense on page 80: &quot;Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is alive....and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we rearely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success&quot;, I just exploded in laughter. God, Allah and Crystals.<br />As a woman this book says absolutely nothing to me: &quot;The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly.&quot;  (p 103). Probably those other weaklings, children as well, though that is not specified. But there is a role for women - waiting around the oasis for their men to either return or hearing they have been killed. Grand! Just what I've been wanting to know - it's transformed my life! The most profound insight yet known to Man. Come, on pull the other leg!<br />If I want to go looking for The Philosopher's Stone, I think I'll choose Harry Potter as my companion!	2001-04-12

I am very pleased to have subsequently read this.<br />It's a collection of very easy to read short essays on Indian politics and society since Indendence (including the author watching Gandhi's funeral pass as a 5 year old).<br />It covers many of the events forming the basis of A Fine Balance, especially The Emergency period. It also brings things more up to date.<br />I really like reading it after A Fine Balance - I might not have been so interested, or it might not have meant so much before. In particular, things like references to crowds being herded together for Indira Gandhi's rallies etc - those sorts of events were just so vividly conveyed in Fine Balance.<br />Mehta delivers information about the vast and fascinating mosaic that is India in bite-sized and very digestible pieces, but she certainly doesn't gloss over the uglier seams in Indian political life.	2001-03-26

It is a page-turner; it is easy to read, and it is salacious. But it is also cold, distant, and doesn't offer anything particularly insightful about motivation or causes of the familial dysfunction, other than the mother's remoteness from her children and the father's diffidence.<br />I wondered at several times whether this was indeed biography, or just an elaborate fiction, along the lines of an earlier generation's &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;. A bit of Internet research suggests that it is indeed real, and that the author set out with a forensic-like dispassionate intent.<br />I suppose I had expected something a little bit more personal. I am pleased it does not have the schmaltzy tones of a bad telemovie. It certainly desrcibes in exquisite and distressing  detail the processes of mental and physical abuse, but it is all conveyed as a description of a specimen on a glass slide.<br />Read it, and don't weep - for there is no emotional connection made with this reader, at least!	2001-03-23

I enjoyed the Bombay setting, usually the upper class or newly emergent middle class (computer programmers for example) - something that is different to the usual view of India. Nevertheless, each had something to say about the state of India: the lost world of detatched housing, which reminded me of the &quot;History House&quot; in God of Small Things, police brutality, secret homosexualand inter-religious love for example. I thought the story about social climbing was hilarious. The book-keepers in the computer story reminded me so much of the tailors in A Fine Balance.<br />Not as much a tour de force as A Fine Balance, but an enjoyable, and at times very poignant read.	2001-03-12

It includes, for example, a library building in the western suburbs University of Western Sydney, and the Joan Sutherland performing Arts  Centre in Parramatta. It covers both public and private buildings, large scale and small - and some private domestic architecture and restaurants.<br />This would be a handy guide for anyone with a serious interest in the city's architecture and redevelopment. However, the print is small. There is a smallish black and white photograph of each project as well. Some are a little too small to fully appreciate the work. That is my only criticism of the book, which otherwise is authoritative as well as accessible to the general reader.	2001-03-06

In Melbourne, people could queue up on the day of the event and buy tickets to even the most popular events.<br />The Melbourne games were dubbed the 'Friendly games' - the first post WW2 games where political issues were not to the fore (although there was a very bloody waterpolo match between the USSR and newly-invaded Hungary)<br />The book focuses on Australian Olympians who are now part of the legendary 'Golden Era' - runners like Shirley Strickland, Betty Cuthbert, John Landy, Ron Clarke (who as a 19 year old lit the flame - that story is retold from Clark's perspective, and is enthralling), swimmers Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and so many more.<br />Another fascinating story is that of Russian Vladimir Kuts and his great rival Czech Emil Zatopek.<br />It is generously illustrated with black and white photos. Each chapter is an essay on an aspect of the games and is followed by numerous pages of photos, each of which tells a fascinating story itself.<br />You don't have to be an Olympics fiend to find interest in this book, but for those who are, it's terrific!	2001-03-06

It most closely reminds me of the sort of work by people like Isabel Allende and Garcia Marquez. I will be looking for more by this author.<br />Veronika and her friends really make you examine your own views of 'madness' and it moved me to examine how I react when confronted with people who display different, unexpected or confronting beaviour in public. I came to understand that I probably move away, avoid, because it is the sheer unpredicatability of what may occur. We usually operate within a comfort zone of familiarity with our own and others' EXPECTED responses to situations, and for something to do otherwise IS challenging.<br />I wish all fiction was simultaneously as accessible - ie readable- and also leave something to think about, linger on. Not that everything has to be 'deep' or 'seriously profound', but it is like the difference between a nourishing, satisfying meal made from the best and freshest ingredients, and a fat-filled junk food takeaway.	2001-02-18

(Actually they are a bit reminiscent of a cross  between something from Lord of The Rings and The Power Rangers) Harry is  meant to be growing and maturing with the readership, I have read, but the  only problem with this is that as the youngest readers embark on the  adventure, they are going to continue on the journey. Not everyone in the  future will have to wait a year between publication of each volume.<br />There is a really well-developed and clearly written time play in this  as part of the climax, and I think some of the very young readers (say 6-7  - yes, some kids as young as that are having the series read to them. I  would recommend it for bright 8 year olds up) would find much of it beyond  them.<br />Still, a great read, and the Quidditch games are possibly the most  exciting yet!<br />The lovely thing about the books is that despite all the  hype accompanying the publication of the 4th HP book, it was bubbling along  by the best possible method: word of mouth amongst kids themselves.<br />Here  we enter the world of Enid Blyton with a very big difference - the English  boarding school story suffused with magic, fun and danger.

Evanovich's heroine, Stephanie is sassy and smartarsed, and a lot of fun. Reading the books is addictive.<br />BUT, the formula seams are starting to show. Like all 'series  books' there is a huge audience to satisfy, and I am afraid that , for me,  this was a bit too much 'more of the same'.<br />All the elements are in  place: the sexual tension between Steph and Morelli, and Ranger. That  Evanovich manages to spin that conundrum out so long is testament to her  skill as a former romance genre writer! There's the dumb petty crims, the  stoopid baddies, the slippery customer (in this case literally) who refuses  to come quietly, the car explosions, Gramna's schtik, Mom still baking  roast dinners and cakes, and silent Dad.<br />I am afraid it has become a bit  too join-the-dots, and it doesn't elicit the same belly laughs I had from  Books 1, 2 and 3.<br />There's a lot to be said for the showbiz saying  &quot;Leave them wanting  more&quot; and I think Evanovich should either  let Steph have a rest for a while OR take a risk and do some major  renovation. Spring some surprises - kill off a favourite character, have  something really unexpected happen....might help save the series.<br />As it  stands, I'd say you can wait for the paperback or reserve it at the  library, rather than rush out and buy as the book hits the stand, which is  how I felt in the early days...	2000-07-20

I actually read two other books in parallel with this one, NOT because it was boring, but because I wanted the characters to stay with me,  to be alongside me on my daily journeys to and from work on the train.<br />The characters are so beautifully realised, so fleshed out as to be  real. I love the multi-person viewpoints from which the book is written.  From one character we learn some very personal perspectives about the grim  humour and brutality of war, before he actually comes to interact with any  of the main characters.<br />The coming together of the protagonists is like a  slow dance at first. They edge closer, then circle and then their fate is  sealed, explosively.<br />There are some gloriously hilarious passages (the  detonation of a mine on the beach comes to mind), and beautiful, sensuous  prose.<br />We are, after all, left in no doubt as to the author's viewpoint  on the protagonists in the war, his attitude toward Mussolini explodes onto  the page. It conveys the Duce as madman so convincingly, very early on,  through a stream of consciusness technique.<br />A terrific read, this has  gone onto my list of favourite books.	2000-06-14
US	50270744	R2I979CYARJZET	0767903854	430278994	In a Sunburned Country	Books	5	89	91	N	N	Another Bryson winner	I am an unreserved Bryson fan. I love &quot;Made In America&quot; about the English language, and, as an Australian living in England for an extended time, thought he captured perfectly both the expat experience, and  the endearing and irritating qualities of the Brits in &quot;Notes from a  small island&quot; .  This book is factually correct. That might sound  inane, but there is nothing more irritating than reading about your own  place and finding it tritely stereotypical or factually incorrect. Bill  scores well on both counts.<br />Bill's take on the Australian Prime Minister  of the day (a small, invisible and colourless entity) is a reasonably brave  thing to say in a sense - an outsider commenting on a political identity  invites derision, but he captures the essence of the man so well.<br />The  other special moment for me is his discovery of cricket on the radio...when  all other stations fade out to static, there is the mighty game. Somehow or  other, despite writing nonsense words, he captures the rhythm and cadences  of radio cricket commentary PERFECTLY. To me, cricket on the radio is as  much about summer as cicadas, running under the sprinkler and crackling  heat. Beautifully pulled off!<br />A good read, and for the first time since  leaving school I actually engaged with some of the stories of explorers!  A  wry but never cynical tone makes for an entertaining read. I am glad he  pays &quot;homage&quot; to that other good 'outsider's book' -  &quot;Sydney&quot; by Jan Morris.<br />Bill Bryson covers much of the same  terrain as the other great US travel writer, Paul Theroux, and seems to  meet as many odd or intersting characters. Bill's disposition, however,  makes him far more open to LIKING a place, and enormously less  self-absorbed.<br />Recommended.	2000-06-14

The included map is very useful, and obviates the need for another map if  space and funds are limited. (We did however use a separate map - the  Michelin road atlas, which is more detailed, and a good size to have in the  car - as a book it doesn't need folding out and fold up constantly!)<br />The  book has some general information about France - climatic, topographical,  transport, society etc, and a section on History and Culture and Art. These  are useful and quite interesting. The bulk of the book is an alphabetical  listing of places. This section contains info on the sites in the town or  area, and surrounding areas.  There is a good scattering of colour photos,  and some diagrams.<br />To compare the entry on Chartres between this and  'Eyewitness' : this book includes a photo of the cathedral, and a smallish  diagram showing the main structures internally and descriptions of the  Royal Doorway and stained glass. There is some brief locational and  historical material about the city of Chartres and mentions the  well-regarded Museum of Fine Arts. Eyewitness, by contrast, gives the  address, phone no and opening times of the museum (might or might not be  helpful, depending on accuracy!). Then follow two double pages on the  cathedral - one containing a 3-D type photo with cut-away, discussing all  the important features (with some pictured), and a double-page spread on  the stained glasses, including a colour diagram and key to all the windows.<br />Baedeker has been surpassed by Eyewitness...	2000-05-21

I found it a very useful introduction to the way language capacity develops - written such that an intelligent lay person  can easily understand it. It covers aspects such as why talking is  important, how children learn to talk, the role of &quot;babbling&quot;,  influences other than parents such as music and books. It also covers  growing up bilingual, and multiple birth scenarios. It emphasises the role  of adults in encouraging positive behaviour through the type of language  used.<br />I recommend this book for parents who want to know more about  language development, high school students studying courses in child  development and as a resource for parenting courses and classes.<br />If  &quot;language is power&quot; (and I believe it is), who doesn't want to  give their child the best possible start?	2000-05-21

If they do,  perhaps they won't be reading the book. There are some titles of good books  for young children, and they suggest asking the children's librarian at the  local library for other suggestions.<br />I suppose there are parents out  there who need taking by the hand and shown pretty obvious things, but  somehow I don't think they will have wandered into the bookshop and chosen  this title! It might be useful in parenting classes and high school child  development classes. As a parent, I have NOT found myself poring over it  looking for inspiration!	2000-05-21

The glossy paper and high quality colour reproductions are the  usual Eyewitness standard.<br />I have used a variety of guidebooks in France  - let's Go, The Rough Guide, Baedeker's, michelin, and this combines the  best of them all.<br />To contrast one place, two books: Chartres. The  Baedeker's includes a photo of the cathedral, and a smallish diagram  showing the main structures internally and descriptions of the Royal  Doorway and stained glass. There is some brief locational and historical  material about the city of Chartres and mentions the well-regarded Museum  of Fine Arts.

Then follow two double pages on the cathedral - one  containing a 3-D type photo with cut-away, discussing all the important  features (with some pictured), and a double-page spread on the stained  glasses, including a colour diagram and key to all the windows.  Eyewitness  wins hands down.  It is the same story with the general Michelin Guide to  France, which also tends to be quite dry. Nevertheless, the regional  Michelin guides are good if you are going to spend a lengthy time in one  region.  The cutaways, diagrams and maps in Eyewitness make it really  special.<br />Eyewitness also includes great information about aspects of  French culture and history, listings on where to stay and eat. If you want  budget accommodation, it's a good idea to carry a Let's Go , Rough Guide or  Lonely Planet type guide as well. The Practical information section is  really a treat in Eyewitness guides, and this one does not disappoint :  pictures of money, a pic of a standard French electrical plug even, how to  operate one of the automatic, self-cleaning toilets (don't allow children  under 10 to use them alone!), using  phone card telephone, or a  coin-operated one, and really useful for the driving tourist, typical road  signs etc.<br />It' easy to rave about Eyewitness, with good cause.

Thank goodness there is a comprehensive index, becuase the arrangement is a bit off-putting.<br />The chapters are broken down &quot;chronologically&quot; - The Thirteenth Month, The 25th to 27th  Month etc etc.<br />Within each section it contains &quot;milestones&quot;  type information - carefully labelled 'what your child MIGHT be doing' (it  reinforces that children develop at different rates, but it still does  encourage you to compare 'your child' with some 'norm'.<br />After that there  are sections on 'What You May Be Concerned About' - for example, at the  19th month it might be 'night wandering, 'underactivity' or 'unclear  speech' amongst other things. Thing is, these are not necessarily  chronologically-linked. So you need to read right through the Table of  Contents and use the index (some page refs are wrong, by the way)to find  the topic you are interested in.  Then follow sections on 'What You Need To  Know' and 'What Your Child Needs To Know', again int he age-specific  sections.<br />I think it would be much better arranged thematically. Perhaps  a short section on things that really are age-specific. There are  subsequent sections on things such as special needs children, toilet  learning, feeding.<br />I have found the information on illness particularly  useful and at other times much other information useful, interesting or  reassurring.<br />I think this book earns its place in a parent's reference  library. Its usefulness extends well beyond the toddler years, and for some  things is still good in the early years of school (by which time life is so  busy there isn't a lot of time for consulting books!)	2000-05-20

Brazelton discusses all sorts of issues to do  with children in their early years, always from the child's point of view,  but never talking down to parents.<br />I found his words enormously helpful  in getting thtough some tough times with colic - it didn't make it any less  stressful, but I was able to hang on and get through it, knowing a bit more  about it and what was happening to that little person.<br />Brazelton sounds  like a wonderfully caring and compassionate pediatrician - I wish he could  be cloned!

She falls in love  with Joe Tasker, who disappeared on Mt Everest in 1982 with Pete Boardman.  They were part of the British team attempting the east north east ridge  ascent. Chris Bonington was part of that team.<br />After their death, Maria,  and Hilary, Boardman's widow undertake their own journey to Tibet - seeking  resolution, answers, closeness to their lovers...<br />She is very frank about  the nature of her relationship with Tasker and her fears, his shortcomings  as a partner etc. The second part is about the journey Maria takes, both  physical, and emotional in dealing with the loss of a partner.<br />In a way,  it seems Hilary was better able to deal with the emotional trauma because  of the surety of her relationship with Boardman. Maria and Joe had yet to  make a long-term commitment.<br />A frank and revealing and very personal  story.

It is arranged in regional sections, but that is not entirely relevant because the pieces range over time and subject. For example, in the section on The Veneto there is an excerpt from  Marcella Hazan's 'Classic Italian Cookbook' (incidentally, one of the very  finest cookbooks - a lovely literary work, and the recipes work too!) - on  Italian Cooking: where does it come from? The Italian art of eating,  restaurants The bacaro experience, gelati. Simply scrumptious.<br />The other  contributors are the very best of literature: Edith Wharton, Francine  Prose, Maty Shelley, Jan Morris, Muriel Spark (one of my favourite  evocations and lived experiences: Venice in Fall and Winter), Lady Mary  Wortley Montagu, Elizabeth von Arnim, Francesca Alexander, Elizabeth  Barrett Browning, George Eliot, Mary McCarthy, Kate Simon, Iris Origo, Lisa  St Aubin de teran, Patricia Hampl, Florence Nightingale, Margaret Fuller,  Eleanor Clark, Elizabeth Bowen, Elizabeth Spencer, Rose Macaulay, Shirley  Hazzard, Ann Cornelisen, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Mary Taylor  Simeti.<br />Each contribution is preceded by some brief contextual  information on the author's piece. It is not 'biographical' in the sense of  being a recitation of dates and places and events, more a little about the  author's motivations or expressed thoughts about Italy or the subject at  hand. After the excerpt is a guide for the traveller - a little more about  the places, people or events mentioned in the passage.<br />This is the sort  of book that inspires a lust for travel, or becomes a treasured travel  companion. It is one of the most 'lovingly' edited books I have ever  read.<br />Many anthologies contain an imbalance of male to female writers,  and more men are travel writers, so this volume is particularly delightful.  The editor elaborates on aspects of places that are particularly concerned  with the cultural history of women. One of the reasons to produce a book  using women writers is expressed by Susan Cahill (editor): &quot; The women  writers who love Italy take a different tone from what we hear in the  travel notebooks of Dickens, Hawthorne or henry james. The women's  narratives come across with a down-to-earth concreteness. They're  irreverent, critical and  anecdotal but never brittle, mean-spirited or  smug at the Italians' expense....No narrator observes safely from a cool,  aesthetic all-knowing distance. Rather, their affection for the place and  people moves the current of the prose.&quot;<br />I love this book.

It will appeal to those who like the more slow-paced, character driven English detective novel. Noone moves at much more than a measured pace, and the book moves in  just that way. There are long passages of description, well written, and  evoking excellent word images. It's not enough to enter a church, there is  inevitably a few paragraphs of architectural and ambient description.  This type of mystery book does have great appeal. The source of my  disatisfaction is actually within the plot itself, not the  characterisation. The really crucial information, upon which the resolution  rests is not really as an outcome of sleuthing, but a convenient device  (letter).  The characters are quite dour; noone ever seems to have much  fun (or even laugh or smile) in a P D James book! James voice is also heard  quite strongly, so you have to be prepared for her fairly High Tory  conservative social views (hates social workers, believes in innate evil).  She does, however, have the knack of lifting the lid on the seething  resentments and everything-is-not-quite-as-it-seems behaviours just under  the genteel surface of English middle class society!  Will appeal to those  who enjoy a languid, none too hurried traditional detective story.	2000-05-12

Books	3	3	3	N	N	Scary	Let me start by saying that I am not particularly interested in anodine children's fare, or over-sentimentalising. However, there were are couple of things about this book that made it less than successful in our  household. First, because the story is told entirely in dialogue and no  narration, it is a bit harder for a younger child to grasp the interaction  between the characters. The adult reader would have to distinguish through  voices if the child is not an independent reader. Second, it is quite scary  - certainly too scary for our son at bedtime when he was a rather sensitive  5 year old. Nightmare territory! Other kids might have no problems, but  just a warning ...  The story is quite entertaining, and after age 7, say,  when children are able to think more abstractly, it might be a bigger  success, when kids also like a bit of terror!	2000-05-04

The question is asked on each page : &quot;Where's The Cat?&quot; A visual clue (part of the cat's body) is shown on each page. The page is then turned and the answer revealed, with the written answer. Each answer begins with a preposition, and each pair  rhymes (eg on the chair, up the stair, under the bed, behind the shed).  An excellent book for pre-schoolers and beginning readers.	2000-05-03

It's a gentle story about two kids with very ordinary home life - nothing fancy, and 2 parents who are leading busy lives - Dad comes in with a lunch box, wearing overalls, looking tired himself, and  lovingly tucks in his daughters after they tenderly tuck in their exhausted  mum.<br />This is a lovely book to share, and with which to encourage the  beginning reader.	2000-05-02

I can't help but be amused by it. I know, I know - it's pap, pulp and historically bunk. But then I don't have a huge issues with modern interpretations, or even inspiration from the classics (legends anyway). After all, I love Xena on the tube!<br />If you've ever seen a Disney adaptation, you get the idea.  Cheaply produced, and dirt cheap to buy. These books are found in supermarket check-out queues. And why not! If they encourage adult/child closeness in the act of reading, that's a good thing. If they encourage the independent emerging reader to &quot;have a go&quot;, then why not?<br />Oh, dear, now I might as well admit I even like the PlayStation game based on Disney's barrel-chested muscleman in the cute pleated skirt!

Would it stand the test of time, would my fond memories prove unreliable.<br />Second, there is all the bad press Noddy has received over  the years - some of it hysterical over-reaction eg reading homosexuality or  paedophilia into the relationship between Noddy and Big Ears - i have read  both over the years.For pete's sake! Friendship is a hallmark of children's  literature and childhood, surely!<br />Third, the racial and sexist  stereotyping. I think some of that has been &quot;cleaned up&quot; to make  it more compatible with contemporary values.<br />I was pleasantly pleased  when I re-read Noddy, and my son started asking for the stories. They are  not earth-shatteringly well-written (in fact some of the writing is a quite  banal, and a bit dated / twee). However, they are reasonable stories that  have a place in a child's literary experience.<br />Some of the moralism is a  bit heavy-handed, and there is definitely an authoritarianism evident in  Blyton's writing. She was a product of her time and class, and she does  tend to patronise a bit.<br />But on the strength of that, I would never  support &quot;banning&quot; Noddy, or even prevent children from reading  them. They are good early reading books for the independent reader. as long  as a child has access to the great range of children't literature, I see no  problem. There are, after all, only 6 of these books. They don't repeat  endlessly in the way some of the more modern series books do.	2000-05-02

The large, colourful illustrations enable the jokes to  be understood. The visual prompts facilitate langauage ability.<br />There is  a delightful sense of anticipation built up with each joke (they are  riddles basically) as the question id posed on one page, and the page is  then turned to find the appropriate answer.<br />Some examples:<br />Why do birds  fly south in the winter? Because it's too far to walk (OK - it's a northern  hemisphere book)<br />What animals need oiling? Mice, because they squeak.	2000-05-02

It encourages the child to start getting into the  swing of things and reciting along. The language is rhythmic.  But, if  that is the sort of thing you want, check out Lynley Dodd and the Hairy  Maclary series as a superior alternative. Her language is more poetic, too  and employs brilliant alliteration.<br />My problem with this book is the  censorious tone - we are introduced to the baby as 'bad' from the  beginning. Why is the baby 'bad'? Oh, it turns out it's bad because,  despite the fact that the elephant keeps swiping things, having asked the  baby if it wants them, the baby never says please. Gawd!<br />The  illustrations are a bit dated and dull I feel, and the depictions of the  vendors uninspiring, at least in the Australian context. maybe it just  doesn't translate very well in a cultural sense.<br />I'm not saying it's  worthless. I just think there are better books out there!	2000-05-02

The story is set  in about the 1940s (judging from the fairisle vests worn by the chief  protagonist, Kieran. Kieran gets a job as a paper-boy selling papers on the  tram.<br />This is a story about another era, populated by characters with  Irish and Anglo sounding names. It is interesting from that point of view,  and could be of use in introducing topics of history, and especially for  Sydney-siders.<br />The story itself is reasonably interesting for children  and would have a place in a library or home collection. It is a gentle  evocation of another era and could inspire curiosity in the younger child.	2000-05-02

There is no denying that kids have been captivated by the Thomas phenomenon, including the mass merchandising of toys and every conceivable household accroutrement - from lampshades to bedspreads, toothbrushes to curtains...overpriced clothing  ranges...mainly on the strength of the TV series and the BBC/ABC marketing  arms.<br />But, but, but, but....I find the stories twee, dated and  humourless.

This time it is a desert environment  of the Finke River. It is a superb introduction to this ecological issue.  it is not, however finger-wagging. At the end Baker says: &quot; Throughout  the world, often with the best intentions, people introduce plants and  animals into a new environment with enormous unforseen consequences.  Without their normal predators, some non-native plants and animals multiply  so quickly they change the whole landscapes and push many native plants and  animals to extinction.&quot;<br />Thus Baker seeks to educate and alert us to  the problem and raise our awarness so as to avoid the same mistakes in the  future.<br />Equally at home as a general reading book, or useful in a primary  school science course.	2000-05-01

Won the Children's book Council Children's Picture Book of the Year Award in 1982.<br />Ormerod's textless illustrations of a family's early morning activities is superb. The little girl,creeps  into mum and dad's bed in the morning (the alarm closck tells us it is  7.20, kisses dad, and then helps him prepare breakfast (the toast burns as  he reads the paper). They take breakfast into mum, still in bed. mum goes  back to sleep, and dad gets lost in the paper. Our heroine gets herself  dressed and toileted. It's now 8.25, and a rush ensues as Mum and dad leap  out of bed to get going.<br />Absolutely delightful. Lots of fodder for  children's imagination, and sequencing skills - some of the pics are in  strip cartoon format.<br />There is a sequel, moonlight, about activities at  the other end of the day, which is just as delightful.<br />A timeless  classic; thoroughly recommended. It was a firm bedtime favourite in our  house from about age 2 1/2 on.	2000-05-01

The under-6 crowd perhaps don;t really &quot;get it&quot; - it requires the  capacity to understand word jokes.<br />The picture of the mother spooning  out &quot;meatblob&quot; (cat food) whilst wearing a handkerchief round her  face is a killer! The look of dismay on the little girl's face as the  &quot;meatblob&quot;lands on her ice cream is priceless.

It has some good basic growing thing projects for kids - eg  planting a window box, growing a runner bean in  a jar.<br />Good for parents  to give them ideas and to read with kids- I don't really think the age  group that would be interested in these activities would read it  independently!<br />Beautiful illustrations in the sharp photographic  house-style of Dorling Kindersley.	2000-05-01

The story itself is quite fun, with the musical notes disappearing into space, and the band members setting off in pursuit, encountering a race of space monsters along the way.<br />However, the characters aren't particularly appealing to children.  They have the names of Northern England characters who MIGHT be in a brass band, but they are all identical-looking rather stern looking men with beards. The illustrations are fairly dull in parts.<br />I think the story has been let down by the illustrations.	2000-05-01

Alone in the house one mischievous day,  they opened a door and they started  to play.<br />I have not met a child yet  who doesn't respond to the beautiful rhythm of the language and the sense  of fun in the Lynley Dodd books.<br />There is just the right amount of  repetition in the rhymes to create a sense of anticipation. The  illustrations are lovely, and Slinky really does have a mischievous glint  in his eye! He is NOT drawn as a &quot;human&quot; - he is all-cat, but  wow, those expressions, depicted through eyes, paws and the hair standing  on end!	2000-05-01

A reading aloud book, definitely, as some of the words are hard for beginning readers, while the story-line is suitable for younger readers.  As for  science, it is worthwhile building up the picture that everyone sitting in  the boat contributes to its sinking. Eventually, the cry goes up that  &quot;Everyone did!&quot; in reponse to the question &quot;Who sank the  boat?&quot;<br />Pamela Allen also wrote &quot;Mr Archimedes Bath&quot; which  is a terrific exploration of water displacement.	2000-05-01

It depicts various activities throughout the day at the beach, from building sand castles falling asleep at night within sound of the ocean.<br />Each double page describes a time and activity (the verse is a little  bit inferior to the pics).

The words are fun and playful, the illustrations happy and well-realised, fully integrated into the story. In the best picture books the illustrations ARE  part of the story, conveying much of the plot, motivations, and  expressiveness.<br />This book is one of those.

A bunyip is a kind of mythical creature which lives in creeks. This bunyip wants to know what he looks like and  who/what he is.<br />In his quest for self-discovery he encounters rebuffs  from a platypus, wallaby, emu. then he meets a man who looks right through  him and tells him bunyips don't exist.  Finally he achieves affirmation  through meeting another bunyip.<br />It sounds like a bit of existential angst  for the picture-book set, but it is fine. The illustrations are a bit dark  and gloomy in places, but faintly reminiscent of Maurice Sendak.<br />A good  addition to a library collection.	2000-05-01

It has a &quot;message&quot; without being saccharine-preachy. It is so evidently set in a multicultural, inner city area with the sort of kids my son mixes with at school everyday. Bob Graham is a terrific illustrator, and this one is not a let-down.<br />The  children who are originally excluded by the &quot;bully&quot; take action  to reclaim their place, and then teach George his lesson, before showing  him that their more inclusive way is better than his selfishness.	2000-05-01

They are great friends and work in the garden together. One time Marj said that she would always have liked to  have visited China, and that her mother had told her if she started digging  and went far enough, she would come out in China. This provides Alexis with  the inspiration she needs, particularly as she needs to get a present for  Marj for her birthday....<br />Richly illustrated, imaginative and fun. It  also has a lovely story to tell about the friendship between the elderly  people, Marj and her husband Bob and the little girl.<br />Thoroughly  recommended.	2000-05-01

A carefully controlled early reading book, where repition and rhyming words are skillfully employed.

Our princess is lucky enough to find out before she gets hitched that the prince probably WOULDN't support her &quot;for better or worse&quot;. Would that more real-life princesses had the guts to realise this before they do the deed.<br />It's not an anti-man polemic, just an affirmative statement that women can be gutsy and THEMSELVES and don;t need to be defined by their appearance being pleasing to the men in their life!	2000-05-01

It deals with a fairly harrowing subject - childhood abuse - both emotional and the hint of sexual. The latter is not dwelt upon, and this is in no way a &#34;victimology&#34;<br />In Diski's journey inside herself, and her physical journey, there is much to admire. I found  myself gasping a couple of times at her reactions and descriptions about  herself. Whilst I can share her love of indolence, and can happily spend a  week's holiday in bed reading (!) I just cannot imagine the 30 years of  lack of curiosity about her mother's whereabouts! What a very (to me)  peculiar family! But then, Diski has brought it so evocatively to the  page.<br />The scenes where she is finding out about her childhood from the  three elderly women ('and the one remaining husband') who lived in her  block of flats are fabulous - very witty. It takes a deft touch to write  with such humour about events which were pretty monumental!<br />The physical  journey - the travelogue - is beautifully written too, and is one of the  more interesting travel stories I have read. In the observations about her  companions it reminds me of Paul Theroux at his best.<br /><br />It is 2016 now, and I am re-reding this. I adjusted the star rating from 4 to 5, as my admiration for it just grows. Jenny Diski wrote two of my favourite travel books ever - this, and Strangers On A Train. It is superb.	2000-04-29

Would love to have a little more fleshed out about her relationship with her sisters in the wake of her father's suicide. But, as to one of the main &quot;events' - the affair, I'm afraid I just didn't buy  it. The juxtaposition of the heart-on-sleeve emotionalism of the American,  with the reserved coolness of the Briton wasn't enough for me to feel that  this affair was 'real', and the passion just wasn't there for me. Lennie  seemed to lack a dimension or something!<br />The novel is written in a very  spare style, and we never are sure whether the 'hormones' of late pregnancy  ARE a factor or not - Susan rails against this possibility.<br />Husband  Alistair does seem a little bit of a Central Casting cliched husband,  dismissive of his wife's trauma, shallow and patronising.<br />This book was a  reasonable read to fill in some idle hours, but I wouldn't rave about it.  For a more elegantly written, and ultimately more hopeful story of  childhood emotional abuse, I prefer Jenny Diski's 'Skating to Antarctica',  which I read at the same time.	2000-04-29

I found myself totally immersed in the first section about the time in the leper village as a Peace Corp volunteer. I was, of course, utterly convinced that it was autobiographical, and remain convinced about the rest  of this &quot;novel&quot;. A travel writer reveals so much about himself in  other works, why not this one?<br />If this is not his &quot;secret  life&quot;, but rather his &quot;other life&quot;, then this is the stuff  that is no secret!<br />Beautifully written, whatever the truth is, with a  control of language that manages to evoke the dry dustiness of African  savanna, or the dripping humidity of equatorial Asia, or the brittleness of  London society matrons.<br />If you like Theroux's travel writing, you will  like this.	2000-04-18

Despite the witty stories of my Family and Other Animals written by Gerald Durrell, and the fine writing of brother Lawrence,one shouldn't assume that all members of the family are  going to be equally as gifted autobiographers.<br />There is a lot of material  in this autobiog to weave a funny and entertaining tale - lots of  &quot;odd&quot; residents in the guest house run by Margo, but it all falls  rather flat `- with a bit of a dull thud.<br />I ended up not really caring  about any of the characters, and that is not how a biog should leave you  feeling - love 'em or loathe 'em, you should CARE!	2000-04-18

I plodded through diligently, more to 'learn' a bit more about the various philosophies than anything else. But then, I didn't retain anything, so I  might as well have read a text book! The contemporary story didn't really  grip me. Not bad to fill in some time, but not exactly my cup of tea.

Lovers of Steinbeck would find  much to admire and enjoy here.  It is a very ideological work. Smedley,  after all, was a champion of the Chinese revolution and friend of Mao  Tse-tung.<br />It is beautifully and evocatively written, so it does not read  like a treatise, but it is a fundamentally political work - feminist and  socialist. It is about STRENGTH and politics.<br />If you are interested in  rural poverty, and fighting against the odds and limitations in early 20th  century America, you will find much in this book. Fans of Maya Angelou may  like this too.	2000-04-17

This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time.  It's  not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type  of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries.  This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about  class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just  enjoyable.<br />Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have  not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted.  It will help you to understand about other places and times. All that is  important for helping to understand where we are now.	2000-04-17

The early parts evoke the loneliness and vulnerability of childhood so painfully and beautifully. It is one of the finest tellings of  tormented childhood that I have read, outside of children's literature.

One such is Janet Evanovich, whose 'Stephanie Plum' mysteries are currently riding high. Before that Ms Evanovich was a  successful romance writer.  Then there is Ms Bacia, who writes in the  over-wrought women-finding-themselves with a background of  pop-psychology-feminism genre. How successfully is a moot point. Not very  elegantly or with much literary success.<br />Her books tend to the  plot  development heights of First X happened, then Y, and exploits the 'now I'm  going to over-describe with the use of strings of adjectives and adverbs'  style of writing.<br />In one book by Ms Bacia the heroine attends an 8 week  creative writing class and unlocks her pent-up talents (and has an affair  which turns to friendship with occasional sexual contact, with the teacher  and leaves her boorish husband and two children who take her for  granted....you get the idea!)It appears Ms Bacia is the product of the  Creative Writing School, and she has seen fit to share her wisdom with the  world.  I would not recommend any aspiring literary genius, or even  half-way decent writer actually take the advice here to heart, but it is  worth a look at (borrow it) to gets some tips on what not necessarily to  do. Successful writing can't be learned from **a** book in my humble  opinion! But reading lots and lots and lots of good writing might help!	2000-04-16

Apart from some necessary theorising and explanation of methodology, it is very accessible. This is the book to get into when  you've had a diet of Boys (mostly) Own Adventures in the Himalayas, and are  looking for something a bit chewier.<br />It is in fact a good companion  volume for anyone with an interest in the sociology of mountaineering.<br />I  recently read Arlene Blum's 'Annapurna: a woman's place' which is an  exemplar of both 70s feminism and counterculture. Ortner places the various  waves of mountaineering (military style expeditions/macho competitiveness/  beginning of women's involvement / counterculture) in their historical and  sociological context, whilst simultaneously placing the Sherpa at the  centre of the story.<br />It also tells much about the interaction between  mountaineering and Sherpa Buddhism - the changes to that religion and the  various responses and attitudes of the Sherpa to the religion.<br />Never does  Ortner present the Sherpas as a homogeneous mass. She gives both a good  depiction of the big picture, but also incorporates enough post-modernist  sensibility to recognise that the Sherpa are not an indistinguishable mass  with identical reactions, motivations etc.She also examines seriously  Sherpa as the agents of change (eg through strikes) and where Sherpa power  vis a vis sahibs lies.<br />People who enjoy this would also enjoy Ed  Douglas's 'Chomolungma Sings The Blues'. Douglas is a climbing journalist  who, whilst not an academic like Ortner, also has a lot to say about  mountaineering and a strong focus on Sherpa involement.	2000-04-10

You will discover why he didn't call it by the other Nepalese name, Sagamartha. Douglas is a mountaineer,  though he admits he does not really understand the compulsion to climb  Everest, and he says towards the end of the book that he never could climb  it because he does not want to enough. This book is sensitive, respectful  and self-effacing. Its purpose is serious - to really discover something  about the cultural impact of the trekking and mountaineering industries on  the people and environment of the Everest area.<br />Along the way, Douglas  makes some insightful observations about the role of governments,  the  impact of non-government organisations and the activities of some of the  successful business - people - Nepalese, sometimes Sherpa, all involved in  the Everest industry. In all three instances he shows us the  sometimes  misguided, sometimes successful and sometimes outright fraudulent efforts.<br />At all times Douglas remains thoroughly respectful of the Nepalese (and  in the first chapter Tibetan) people, despite also being able to show us  the cultural and political warts. Whilst having a few harsh judgements  about some trekkers and some mountaineers, he also manages to treat them  fairly and - no mean feat at times. Perhaps, however, he is hardest of all  on climbers: &quot;...there are so many other climbers whose photographs of  locals punctuated their articles and lectures to break up all those shots  showing what heroes they'd been with a little local culture.  Anthropologists and environmentalists must have a strong suspicion that  most climbers and trekkers see local people as a human backdrop to their  adventures. I almost admired the climber who told me that if he could go to  the mountain in a bubble to avoid disease and arguments with porters, he  would. At least he was being honest.&quot;<br />Douglas writes movingly of  the unrecognised and mostly unheard about porters who have been the  casualties of the industry - ill-clad and ill-equipped, some have been  turned out by expeditions and left to fend for themselves when things have  got sticky. There are generally no helicopter rescues for the porters.  Douglas calls this &quot;moral squalor&quot;. The myriad cut-price trekking  companies pay cut-throat rates and fail to equip these workers well. On the  other hand, Douglas shows how portering is integral to the local economy,  and quotes statistics debunking the view that permanent physical damage is  the result of portering.<br />After you have read Krakauer's 'Into Thin  Air', and Boukreev's 'The Climb' and the other expedition journals and  diaries, and coffee table books about Everest, turn to this one to find out  about the people and the impact on their lives.  This book also reads as a  travelogue, as it recounts, in the main, Douglas's own trekking experience  in the spring of 1996. He encounters along the way many of the groups that  became caught up in the storms and tragedies of May 10 1996, including  Scott Fisher's group and David Breashear's IMAX film team. Some of the  descriptive passages are wonderful word pictures. I had a real sense of  what it is like at the top of Kala Patta and Gokyo Ri, for example.<br />Some  passages that particularly spoke to me (you will surely discover  others):<br />&quot;Professional climbers earn their living describing their  own achievements, while those with a more long-term or scientific purpose  can claim some benefit to mankind other than the realisation of ambition.  It was clear, however, that they were prone to the same jealousies and  quarrels.&quot;<br />&quot;The truth has to be faced that guides have treated  the mountain as a resource, just as the Nepalese authorities have. It's a  way to cash in on the regular flow of books and films about Everest, a  package deal to the roof of the world for anyone with enough money and an  excess of self-confidence. As for the motivation of people who are prepared  to spend a small fortune for a chance to be pulled up Everest, I can only  guess. If it is to impress, then the huge resources and assistance required  to get them to the top should temper their sense of achievement. If it is  for a love of adventure, then they probably ger more than they bargain for.  But then why climb Everest at all? That's the hardest thing to explain.  That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question.&quot;ney and an  excess of self-confidence.

Very good indeed. Its descption of life for a woman seeking independence in Sydney on the post-WW2 period is excellent, as is  the exposition of aging, and the bitter-sweetness of an expat returning to  a former home.

Formulaic series book, but a favourite of Pokemaniacs wherever they may be. I don't find the Pokemon phenomenon all that offensive. Like most fads and fashions that have preceded it (Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers et al) no doubt it too will pass. All the huff and puff and moralising doesn't change  the fact that Disney has retained a grip on child (and older) culture for  decades, and that can be as nauseating in its own way as any other mass  cultural fad. This book cashes in on the movie, and  will be read alone by  the competent sub-teen reader, or by parents aloud. There isn't any killing  in Pokemon - there are battles, and competition between 'trainers' and  their captive Pokemon. The writing is hardly inspiring, but then kids'  taste are as eclectic as any one else's - one minute the original Winnie  the Pooh, or Alice, the next Pokemon.	2000-03-25

Dorling Kindersley have long published marvellous series information books for schools and young people, and they have brought the  same high quality of production to their travel series.  Eyewitness does  a few things superbly: 1. Their use of full colour photography. 2. No Top  Tens or 1/2/3 stars. Eyewitness just show it how it is and let you decide  what interests you most. 3. Real maps, with real street indexes, integrated  right into the book. No more sketch maps with dubious scale or  misrepresentations of actual distances. 4. Breaking up cities into  manageable and logical sectors. So after helping you get there, they offer  full coverage of the area.  5. There is no attempt to be hip or impose  points-of-view. Other guide books do that, and do it quite well at times,  so they are best left to that field.<br />Italy is a fat book, and it might be  heavy to carry around, but as other reviewers have said it is invaluable.  It would replace at least two other guide books, and relegate the other  lushly illustrated &quot;guides&quot; that are out there to the  coffee-table status that is probably more appropriate.<br />My one criticism  is that the accommodation listings are more appropriate for the well-heeled  traveller. Here's what I'd do: go to the local library and borrow the Let's  Go, Rough Guide and Lonely Planet. Photocopy the listings and use them to  supplement . As for restaurant listings, I've never used them in any guide  book - just stepped outside the lodgings and wandered!	2000-03-25

I have to admit I read it AFTER I visited Andalusia, but wish it had been on the market when I did go. It is an excellent armchair travel  book. It has certainly whetted my appetite to go back. Retrospective  reading always reveals gems you wish you had discovered at the time. One  real bonus of Eyewitness guides is that they have PROPER maps, with street  indexes integrated into them, unlike some guides which rely on sketch maps,  and where the scale can be a bit hit and miss. Another advantage is they  don;t attempt to list a &quot;Top Ten&quot; for each place, rather they  provide comprehensive coverage, and divide their coverage by locale.	2000-03-25

It is more than that as well, containing an introductory section on how coasts are made, life along the seashore, shells, beaches, rocky  coasts, rockpools, wetlands, coral reefs, fish and birds. Part 2 is about  the ocean and the weather. Each section of coast includes a regional map,  and text introducing the area, including natural features, climatic  information, leisure facilities like picnic grounds, parks, camping grounds  etc. Small articles about particularly interesting phenomena accompany the  text. For example, in the section from Shute Harbour to Airlie in Qld there  is an article on cane toads. I recommend it as a good companion on a  driving holiday (far too big and heavy for a backpack), and as a good  reference book at home.	2000-03-25

It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing  about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have  lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the  locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the  social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still  exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot  development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more  cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people  were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will  didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there  was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything.  Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty  representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth  the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says  about its time and place.	2000-03-25

He says he set out to write a book that is an homage to the craft that has brought him the  greatest pleasure in his life, without being didactic.  I believe he has  achieved his stated aim. The first part is an introduction to the Oriental  carpet, including the ambiguity of its origins. Then follows a history of  the rug, including Mexican influence, and then the Eastern influence, the  confluence of Islam and rug craft, the importance of trade centred in  Venice, and more. Then there is a survey of different approaches to  carpets, from Persia, India, Turkey, the Caucasus, Central Asia and China.  A large section includes different symbols found in carpets, and to  conclude, the importance of carpets in western decoration.  The book is  lavishly illustrated with colour and black and white full-page plates, as  well as diagrams showing different types of weaves, motifs and symbols.<br />A  handsome volume from someone who knows and loves such carpets, and truly  appreciated by me who enjoys their beauty, even if I cannot afford them.  The armchair aesthetic equivalent of climbing Everest through the words of  others!	2000-03-25

Section 1 is entitled Politics and Daily Life. It includes pieces by women of a variety of ethnic backgrounds, ranging over an extremely  eclectic range of topics, from women convicts to racism and politics from  koori women's point of view.  A reasonable representation of Aboriginal  women is present - more than in most collections. Part Two looks at  particular places , It is called Cities - Country - Rivers.  Some of the  pieces are about places well away from the regular tourist path, for  example Flinders Island. This is a feminist volume, and includes chapters  from lesbian women. Staying and working on organic farms is popular these  days. Kaye Johnston's chapter &quot;The revolutionary nature of Lesbian  Organic Gardening&quot; tells about her and her partner's project -  Moonraker farm in the NSW Southern Highlands. At the end are several  listings, some of which may be out of date. More useful is a Recommended  Reading section which includes literature, anthologies, poetry and plays,  fiction, autobiography, history, - mainly, but not exclusively by women.  There is biographical information on each of the contributors. This is a  really interesting volume to dip in to, and it is a very valuable companion  to Australian cultural life, breaking out of the Crocodile Dundee,  sunbronzed Aussie type of stereotype. And, I think, despite the title,  there is much for men in here too!	2000-03-25

This richly illustrated volume is a lovely addition to a library, and as well  provides good practical information about how kilims in various guises can  be used and displayed to their best advantage. The emphasis is on USING and  LIVING with kilims, not as works of art or museum pieces.  The first  chapter is a useful history of the origins of kilims, the second on the  materials and techniques used in making them, and the third about  recognising and identifying different types of kilims, including motifs and  symbols and characteristics of kilims from the main areas of production -  Anatolia, The Caucasus, Persia and Afghanistan.  After that follows  various decorative uses - on floors, walls, and unusual forms. The book  finishes with tips on care and repair and listings for those interested in  collecting these lovely items.	2000-03-25

Unlike some older, and similar comprehensive surveys  of Australia, this volume does include a section on Aboriginal-European  relations, from first contact to the early 1990s and the Mabo judgement  affecting land rights.

That officials REFUSED to acknowledge for so long  (and during Humphrey's quest) that any such thing as the forcible  'transportation' of children from the UK to Australia up to the second half  of the 20th century, is damning.<br />Should be on history curricula in both  countries. politicians should be required to read it before they can  represent their constituents. It should be read alongside 'Bringing Them  Home' about the Aboriginal stolen children, forecably removed from their  families also well in to the 20th century.

At first glance you can imagine it could be awful - a loving portrait, written by a loving sister.  However, Hopkirk is a good writer, and she manages to give an honest account of her brother's life. It has the bonus of being able to get intimately close to  Brett the child. Your heart almost pains as you know that this lively,  loving and loved youngster will die too young.  It also informs the  reader about the life of the artist, and is pretty well warts and all, or  at least as raw as a family member could make themself go!  A more  salacious 'inauthorised' biog by Margot Hilton and Graeme Blundell is also  worth reading. I read it after this one, and I recommend that order.

I have noticed (as evidenced in the reviews) that  Americans on the whole LOVE this book, being as it is about people strange  to them, but are not as enamoured of his observations closer to home. I  wonder if that is because Bryson does take the broad, stereotypical brush  out, and those close up can see that the detail is lacking. Maybe in this  book he takes a more affectionate view of his subject matter - it is after  all a 'farewell tour'.  I am looking forward to his book on Australia, to  see how I react from a local perspective!<br />NB - This one had me laughing  out loud, and boring people around me by insisting on reading bits out  loud.

Not only is it a good &quot;people's history&quot; of some aspects of US history, it is one of  those books you reach for when your 'favourite' language pedant starts  waxing on about how terrible it is that noone speaks's proper any more, or  &quot;the kids of today...&quot;  As an Australian, and therefore being  trilingual (British, American and Australian English) I love to be able to  stop some fool in their tracks with the information that some 'vulgar  Americanisms' are actually much older forms of English that were  transported and survived, at the same time as English mutated in its  homeland.  The Grammar Pedants won't have it that English is a living  language, that usage, spelling and grammar 'rules' change ... this book  shows how it does and also demonstrates how some of the most common words  we use to deal with life in our age were once US-invented neologisms or  even slang.  All this (and more) delivered in Bryson's wry and ironic  (read witty) tone.	2000-03-24

This is one of those books which examines the most profound aspects of the human condition. Anne Frank was a real person, whom many people have come to know a little about through her famous diary.  What  this book did was enable us to see her as part of a family - a genetic  family and a family of humanity. This is the sort of book which it is  important to guide younger people to. As we leave behind the century which  saw the enormous destruction of world wars, but where genocide is all too  constant still, this is the sort of book which is necessary so that we  don't forget.  I cannot speak highly enough of this book.	2000-03-24

Parks has chosen to live in Italy, and has both a love and respect for his wife's homeland, and another cultural perspective with which to look at its foibles and frustrations.  Unlike Peter Mayle who  seemed in  A Year In Provence to be laughing AT some of the locals, and who  was somewhat removed from daily life, Parks is fully immersed in everyday,  workaday life, and in raising children, getting to know and battle with  bureaucracies, admiring education systems etc.  And unlike that great  phoney Frances mayes, the Tuscan dilettante who jets in each summer to  dabble in cute stone-villa Italy, Parks has to come to terms withh being a  'local' whist still being a straniero.	2000-03-24

This is worth reading at the same time as Carlo Levi's 'Christ Stopped At Eboli' , which I have also reviewed.  The warmth and generosity shown Newby, an English  POW soldier on the run by the mountain people is touching and bitter-sweet.  This is a fitting testament to them.	2000-03-24

I was totally enthralled in the story of Troy from Cassandra's point of view. It is a rollicking and sympathetic telling of the tale. Of course it isn't &quot;history&quot;, but that is one of the wonderful things about  the traditon of Troy. There is no &quot;official history&quot;, so matters  are open to interpretation and retelling by any author, either in the oral  tradition, or nowadays written. Zimmer Bradley makes a good job of it.	2000-03-24

Hasn't got the historical depth of a Blue Guide, but this series exists for a different purpose, and this one hits the mark.  It has information on just about everything the visitor would want to see and do, and it would be a  useful companion for someone living in the city for a period of time.  There is another, similar series called 'Everyman Guides' which do not  appear to be available on amazon. The publisher is David campbell of  London. I have their Istanbul guide as well. It does some things similarly  to Eyewitness, and the colour is as good. It, however, takes a thematic  approach, so there are chapters on things like Istanbul as seen by painters  or writers.  I think both volumes are excellent, and provide good reading  in preparation for a trip, or armchair daydreaming!<br />Having lived in  Istanbul, I would have welcomed both these books.	2000-03-24

It doesn't pretend to be hip, it doesn't attempt to herd you in certain directions by ascribing &quot;stars&quot; to the attractions. It contains some of the lesser gems, and all the big  attractions.  What I like best is that it is arranged according to areas  of London that are explorable on foot. When you travel under London on the  'Monopoly Board' tube, you could be amnywhere. there is not necessarily one  logical place to start in explorations of this most fascinating of cities.  With this book, it doesn't really matter! Just come up from below ground,  and start. Some other guide books try to list the Top Ten Sights - which  could take you from one end of this sprawling metropolis to the other. This  book allows logical (and delightful) discoveries, no matter where you fetch  up on any particular day. let's face it, if you're out at Greenwich, you;re  not going to race off to kew gardens, you're more likely to want to poke  around the environs you are in.

It has withstood the transition from the television age to the digital age. When the gameboy is put away, the video turned off, the older child will STILL delight in that imaginative recreation made possible through the worlds and illustrations here.  It  allows fear to be expressed within boundaries of comfort and security - the  young mind can explore the possibilities of defiance and independence all  the while knowing their is the reassurance of love. And the possibility is  left open at then end for Max to be sure that there always is an  escape!<br />If anyone is looking for a book to buy for a young child, I would  recommend this (and any of the Hairy MacLary series by Lynley Dodd). I  reckon ths book is an ENTITLEMENT of childhood!	2000-03-23

About a family who love to swim off the pier in the ocean, the young girl is afraid of going too far into the deep water.<br />It is not one of those stridently didactic books that sacrifices literature for a &quot;good  message&quot;. It is a terrific book to share with children who are facing  particular fears (my son was scared of the water) - and acknowledging that  fears are usual but can be overcome.<br />The illustrations are also lovely,  the water that special Australian ocean blue!	2000-03-23

It shares a title with a book by Sally Morgan, an Aboriginal women whose search for her own identity and place was published at the same time.  This book can be read in either direction. For younger  children, it may be easier to start at then end an move forwards. For older  children, part of the fun is in uncovering the history of the place - an  inner urban area of Sydney.<br />The book emphasises the timeless continuity  of the place, and that even though we might be the temporary custodians of  a piece of land, we share a common history and linkage through our  humanity, and our Aboriginal history.  Lushly illustrated by Donna  Rawlins, and words by Nadia Wheatley. A valuable asset to any school  library, primary or secondary, and public library, as well as the shelves  at home.<br />My son first showed interest in t at about age 4, and has  returned to it periodically since - ie over 2 years. It will stay with him  for many years yet!	2000-03-23

It tells you about the best walks around the shores of sydney harbour, for example. For a large city to still have so much bush and  vegetation so close to the city is a testament to the efforts of the  residents and unions who fought to preserve so much through 'Green bans' in  the 1960s and 70s.  This book shows you how to enjoy those places, not  only guiding you on the walks, but detailing the public transport routes to  get to the beginning and from the end of each walk.  Highly recommended. I  use it to play tourist in my home town.	2000-03-23

Not this one. It covers pretty much everything that a visitor to this city would want to see and do, and even leads people a little (but not TOO far)  off the beaten track. There are suggestions for walks along some of the  coastal paths, for example, and it includes places farther afield like  captain Cook's Landing Place.<br />Like all the books in this series, it is  lavishly illustrated and the maps are good.  I use it for inspiration for  weekend activities. It is a good general guidebook, which could be  supplemented by more specialised volumes if you want to concentrate on one  aspect of Sydney - eg guides to walks around the harbour, or activities  specially for children, guides to national parks etc. but this book seems  to cover just about everything at least in an introductory sense.	2000-03-23

This book is perfect for anyone remotely interested in early women adventurers and/or the life of an  Englishwoman in Constantinople in the early 18th century.  Lady M, after  observing the traditional practice of inoculating children against smallpox  pioneered the practice back in England with her own children.  Eventually  Lady M separated from her husband and pursued her much younger italian  lover to his homeland.<br />Truly a woman out of step with the prevailing view  of women in her times, and this book is a real gem. It consists mainly of  letters written to her family and friends.	2000-03-23

I did lend it to my friends (and sat on the edge of my seat hoping they wouldn't be the kind who don't return your precious books!)<br />Anyway, I did read it again, and I love it just as much.  I re-read Austen at various times, whenever I feel like 'hearing' that  crisp, ironic dialogue and beautiful observations that somehow still seem  fresh today.<br />Tomalin has achieved something magical in this volume. She  has managed to make it feel as if I really know something about Jane, her  society and surroundings.<br />When first introduced to Jane Austen in high  school, she seemed remote, a woman of another time and place. What could  she possibly have to say to a young woman from a distant land? Well,  perhaps not much at 15....a bit more life experience would be a good thing.  But maybe a good place to start would be this biography.<br />I was fed on  the stereotype that Jane Austen was a sickly, sheltered girl and woman, one  who had little experience of life outside the drawing room, a sort of  consumptive, repressed being. Tomalin shows how far from the truth that  portrait is. Jane knew about the ins and outs of the country ball from  active participation. She could draw affectionatley hunmorous word pictures  of some of her characters through experiencing them. She was quite  well-travelled for a woman of her generation,  own country, sure, but then  only the most extraordinary women were off on the  'Grand Tour'. All these  things are obvious in her books if you think about it - Miss Musgrove and  friends - male and female- off on their jaunt to Lyme Regis, for example.  Jane could write about love and engagement through experience. She did  love, and was loved in return, but chose not to marry. Children (nieces and  nephews) were a joy to her and she was actively involved in the upbringing  of some of them.  But never, ever, do we meet an anachronistic Jane.  Tomalin does NOT try to shoe-horn her in to some modern day feminist  iconography. What we are left with is a portrait of a thoroughly modern  woman of HER times. A woman who lived a full life , on her own terms, but  within the boundaries of the society of which she was part. That she  managed to offer us, the modern reader, such a beautifully resonant  portrait of her class and times, that stays fresh today, is a tribute to  Austen. That Tomalin has brought that so vividly alive in introducing us to  Jane Austen the woman is a tribute to Tomalin.y feminist  iconography.

It is a part of the world I know little of. I just loved the semi autobiographical tone, enhanced by the photos (even though I know it's fiction).<br />The birth scene  was wonderful, and reminded me of stories I imagine of my own ancestors in  the Australian bush.<br />Shields is a terrific writer, for those who like  &quot;good literature&quot; but need an eclectic diet.	2000-03-21

However, I read this for a book club of which I am a member. The issues and thoughts raised in this book, and the sheer competence of the writing led me into a  new area of literature. I defy anyone who has enjoyed this to stop here -  next comes 'Into Thin Air', then the Anatoli Boukreev book 'The Climb' and  then the whole Everest and mountain climbing genre opens up!<br />I am sure  this is true, because the Amazon 'Customers who bought this....also bought  these...' reminder bears this out.<br />Krakauer is a master at guiding the  reader through an ever-changing emotional response to the subject. At first  I thought Mccandless was a stupid young thing, but then I slowly came to  recognise his point of view, whilst retaining my right to disagree with his  actions.<br />He was hopelessly ill-prepared and naive, but those are not sins  in themselves. Youthful indiscretions usually make a person stronger. In  this case, because of the extreme conditions they led to his death. For  that I cannot condemn the young man, but feel saddened by the avoidable  waste of life. I don't think he had a &quot;death wish&quot; at all - I  think the real sorrow is that, towards the end, the young man's will to  live was probably stronger than ever.<br />Krakauer has done a fine job of  conveying the story and the messages to me.	2000-03-21

The quality of production is  excellent - beautifully illustrated with photos integrated throughout the  text. And a simply fascinating story, well told.<br />Maybe one day I will  read the Anker and Firstbrook stories (always stimulating to get different  points of view on a subject) but for now I am satisified with this.	2000-03-21

Having read lots of the 'Boys' Own Adventures' type climbing stories, and thoroughly enjoying them, I might add, I was looking for something from the experience of my own gender.  I liked the book, and there were only a few  minor things that grated. The particularly 1970s type feminism, in all its  naivete and idealism was amusing at times. More offensive was the at times  patronising tone towards the porters and sherpas (I am looking forward to  reading Sherri Ortner's book about Sherpas). The gung-ho-ness of some of  the women (we don't need porters, we don't need sherpas) was interesting  but a bit cringe-making.<br />Unfortunately, at the end we had an update on  the lives of the survivng members, but nothing further about the Sherpas.  This is despite Blum having half-Sherpa children and spending much of her  time in the Himalayas, and mention that one had divorced the Sherpa cook.  So Blum one might imagine, might have had the resources to do an update on  the Sherpa people on the expedition as well. Did any of the women they  mistakenly involved ever make it back on an expedition?<br />The quality of  production is good. I particularly like that the photos are integrated into  the text, so it comes together as a whole, with illustrations right at the  point of narration, rather than the more usual photo prints gathered  together as plates once or twice in a book . It does give a slighty  peculiar &quot;text-book&quot; look to it, but I think it works well.  &quot;Ghosts of Everest&quot; is another book that achieves this, with very  high quality colour pics. I liked the pics recording every day things  around the camps.<br />All in all, a good read and enlightening about an  activity in which I am an armchair fellow-traveller.	2000-03-21

Marr has written a scholarly yet entertaining biography, and you really feel you come to know something about an Australian icon -  our only Nobel laureate in literature.<br />In everything i have read  (including White's own portrait of himself, Flaws In The Glass) he comes  across as a horrible man - a misogynist, but with some political principles  with which I might agree.<br />Nevertheless, that is not the point of  literature, or art, to be loved by one and all.

The NT remains a backwater of injustice  to this day - most often directed towards Aborigines, but also, as  demonstrated here, with invective directed towards another group outside  the conventional mainstream.<br />The media reported in the most outrageously  biased and one-sided fashion, and actually whipped up the populous into a  frenzy of finger-pointing, gossiping hatred toward Mrs Chamberlain.<br />I am  not at all religious, but to my mind Seventh Day Adventism doesn't even sit  far outside the mainstream Christian tradition, yet we were encouraged to  believe it was some sort of devil-worshipping Jim Jones type sect.<br />Eventually the government was forced to recognise the veracity of the  Chamberlain's story. ironically, another person died on The Rock for the  essential clue to be discovered - a tourist fell off and his body was found  near the baby's matinee jacket. It is almost beyond belief the lengths the  authorities went to to balme the parents, when most of the people closest  to the event on that night verified or supported the Chamberlain's case.  Yet those voices were drowned out for years.<br />Bryson did a wonderful job  of bringing this story to public atttention,and some of the most important  parts were effectively translated to the screen in the Meryl Streep movie  (Cry In The Dark).	2000-03-21

Actually, I did put it down....had to when I got towork, or occasionally to turn the light out at night. The short story format makes it an excellent companion volume for dipping into.<br />I found some of the K2 stories especially 'breath-taking' and the edge-of-the-seat drama present everywhere. I agree with the review that says the piece by widow Maria Coffey is a gem - another perspective on the mountain climbing experience.<br />I also liked the older, more historical tales, contrasting some of the worls views about climbing with more modern attitudes evident in some of the newer books, especially now focussing on the commercial aspects of climbing especially Everest.<br />Am I alone in thinking that mountain climbing to the point of summiting used to be a more collective, comradely pursuit, and now it is 'everyone for themself' ? I know there is a lot of bunk that could be said - and I don't hold that the class-ridden older (especially Bristish) school of mountaineering in the days of Mallory et al was some kind of 'golden age'. But on the other hand, there was something in the spirit of the times then lacking now...and the difference is not just money. The old Siege-like expeditions required vast amounts of sponsorship....but it was aimed at the collective effort, whereas now it is anyone who can stump up $65 000 of their own wealth.<br />I might be wrong, but I think there is something different now. Not being an expert, I'm interested to continue exploring this. This volume is a good place to start reflecting on some of those issues.	2000-03-21

It is certainly one I wouldpack amongst my Top Ten for life on a desert island. It is about theindomitability of human spirit. It is about attempted repression and inhumanity of fascism, yet it is about the small wonders and joys that are human life.  Eboli, the nearest major town is the 'last outpost' of civilization - beyond which are 'heathens', untouched by Christ, or salvation. Of course that is a metaphor, not reality, for our little village has the same corrupt and stifling religiosity as elsewhere.<br />This is one of those personal accounts that makes it possible to begin to understand the enormity of the outrage of political repression, and ultimately war.	2000-03-21
US	50270744	RHGSOQAP4FBUG	1875559388	255138433	Radically Speaking	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Scholarly, text book	I imagine this will be used in Women's Studies courses. It is also accessible to the general reader, even ones whose university days are long behind them!<br />It is a very useful update on radical feminism - free of  postmodern jargon (and positively hostile to post modernism in places.  Little cheer from the sidelines on that score!)A whole section is devoted  to an &quot;interogation&quot; of post modernism.<br />It does offer material  from a number of cultural perspectives, so is not at all dismissive of  their eing different views and experiences of feminism.<br />I think the  editors are Australian, or at least worked there for long periods, and i  think it shows. I have always found Australian feminism to be more  eclectic, perhaps pragmatic, certainly less one-side posturing than some  others. Australian feminists achieved a lot over the past 25 years,  succeeding at infiltrating the very corridors of bureaucracy (a breed of  bureaucrats known as Femocrats emerged). There were fundamental policy  changes. Now rapidly being undone by a radically conservative govt. The  need for feminism is not over, and this volume takes its place on the  shelves, updating feminist thought and taking us back to the need to focus  on the reality of women's lives. A good companion volume to Germaine  Greer's The Whole Woman.	2000-03-21

I wanted to read about a woman's experience on Everest, particularly during the 1996 season so well written about by others (particularly Krakauer). How disappointed and let  down can one be!<br />I agree with the climber below (Gabrielle). I have  never, not never will climb mountains, but I founbd this to be  self-indulgent and full of new age psycho-babble.<br />I found her atttitude  towards others patronising, especially in an excrutiating couple of  exchanges with Boukreev....one where she offers the &quot;poor boy&quot;  from Kazakhstan rolls of film, beciuse she is so liberally endowed by her  sponsors.<br />In fact the whole book read like one written to satisfy some  sponsorship deal. It was lazily written - much barely edited journal  writings.<br />Didn't add anything to my knowledge of or voracious interest  in Everest and other high peaks, and doesn't capture the &quot;women's  experience&quot; as well as, for example, Arlene Blum in  &quot;Annapurna&quot;.<br />Am still searching for something terrific by a  woman climber on Everest!	2000-03-21

But I didn't. poor old Swede. poor fellow me. What a humbug. Even the radicalness of his daughter was humbug. Or is that the point and I  missed it?  I find Roth's writing boring and self-absorbed. And  condescending towards the working class, as depicted in the glove factory  employees. A man without empathy is the voice I hear from this  author.<br />Still looking for the Great American Novel....	2000-03-21
US	50270744	R1G4YPZGWSL53C	0897323025	703852061	Everest: the Ultimate Hump	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Tongue in cheek	Well, I agree this is the irreverence that the Everest genre was waiting for! I laughed quite a bit, and smiled at much of it.<br />The Dianas (Princesses that is) expedition really tickled my funny bone the most. How  inspired to take two such icons, both ludicrously unattainable for most  mere mortals, and marry them.<br />Humour is such a subjective thing, you  will either love it or hate it. But don't condemn this take on Everest  because of a misapprehension of what it is about. It is a cartoon book. It  does actually say more about the reality of the sponsorship and money side  of 'personal Everests' than all the thousands of words I have read on the  subject thus far.	2000-03-21

The language is quite beautiful. But somehow  I just didn't quite buy the pathetic unrequited love at its core. Can't  quite put my finger on why not.<br />I agree it explored all sorts of types of  love, and the descriptive passages of place were also highly evocative.	2000-03-21
US	50270744	RNCKSIHK3CJSM	0375704582	97635291	Midnight in Sicily	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Molto bene	This book is one of the very best I have read on an aspect of Italian life and politics.(The other is Christ Stopped At Eboli) I am going to read it again, as some of the detail is fading from memory. Robb, a long-term  ex-pat writes seriously about the underbelly of Italian life, but also  conveys hislove and respect for the country, its traditions and food  especially!<br />When visiting my husbands relatives in Sicily, I found the  undercurrents there present - men with rifles nd wolf-dogs standing in  country lanes at dusk, protecting their orange trees, for example. My  cousins not naming the menace, but refering to it obliquely, shrugging  their shoulders....my uncle working two jobs, the first as a respected  paramedic in an ambulance service, but earning enough for a basic existence  only, but with the promise of a state pension. The second job in the  afternoon in order to afford the types of consumer goods and housing that  the now advanced Italian nation takes for granted. Much has changed since  WW2, since the mass emigrations from a broken country. But much also  remains the same and Robb gets to the heart of it beautifully.	2000-03-21

To me his sometimes acerbic observations get towards the truth of a place AS HE PERCEIVES IT. When I read travel books I likt to hear the author's point of view. That may or  may not accord with my own or others'. I like also to compare them to other  writers' experiences of the same place, whether it somewhere I will travel  to by aircraft or mind's eye via the armchair only.<br />How does Theroux  strike up conversations with such odd collections of people? Partly because  he travels alone, and partly because he is open to hearing the stories of  others. Either he hits on the most interesting people in every place, or he  endures more mundane conversations than anyone in order to cull the best!  He must keep assiduous notes - really WORK at travelling to be able to  relate in such detail.<br />I know he gives us glimpses of his working modus  operandi -references to the books he is reading, and the note-taking. A few  times on the train I wished he had looked up longer i9n order to be able to  tell us a little more about what was a bit further away from the track.	2000-03-21
US	50270744	R1PQYLDR2FD5PA	0804111197	342742231	Streisand: Her Life	Books	4	7	7	N	N	It's good	I found the strongest part of the book was the early years - growing up in Brooklyn, and the determination to build an acting career. I was surprised that it was almost a revelation to Barbra that she might make a career out  of singing, undertaken in order to keep the wolves from the door.  I'm not  an obsessive fan by any means but I found this book about a woman who is  such an icon a good and meaty read. I kind of admnire her  &quot;obsessive&quot; single-mindednessto achieve what she wants in her  art.  Not a hagiography, but a respectful look at an interesting and  complex woman.	2000-03-21
US	50270744	R1TEEC6MLXOZEU	0571199399	881412266	Leaning Towards Infinity: A Novel	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Infinite reading	I wanted this book to continue. I loved it. I read it about the same time as some other books ...Hanna's Daughters was one, and I thought it had every bit as much to say about mother-daughter relationships. Also 'Gut  Symmetries' by Janette Winterson, which I did not like...this had more to  say about the mathematical woman genius.<br />It makes the point rendered  over and over by Dale Spencer in 'Women of Ideas and What Men have Done To  Them' but in a fictionalised account, well plotted and without the  hyperbole to which Spender is prone.<br />Woolfe is a good writer, and her use  of language approaches the delights of Arundhati Roy in God of mall Things  (but never surpasses).	2000-03-21
US	50270744	R31ZW4MCJSXJOL	0140267972	974554219	Desert Places	Books	4	27	29	N	N	A tough book	Ms Davidson is a tough woman, who for some reason sees the need to put herself into the most excrutiatingly isolating situations.<br />I found the book fascinating, and was overwhelmed at times by the sense of being so  alone within a country where there is the most confronting closeness of  human being with human being. This is an India I know i would not be  equipped to deal with.<br />i was a bit critical of her at first that she  always had her friend, the wealthy Indian upon whom to fall back, but I  doubt whether she would have been able to approach completion of her task  without him. The need to retreat every so often from the sheer hard grind  of trying to accomplish the task she set herself. I know i would have had  to find a 5 star, deep-bath resort long before Davidson welcomed the  comfort of a barely basic hotel room with hot water!<br />The lives of the  rabbari as presented to us through Davidson's eyes (and god knows they are  hardly likely to be presented any other way!) is fascinating. I know the  attraction of the 'exotic' can lead to patronising people, but davidson  never does that, and does not allow her (dare i suggest, midle class,  western, educated?) readership to get too comfortable with their own views  of the world.	2000-03-21

But I am a voracious reader of biography, and have admired McCrum's other work.<br />He made me feel what it was like in the  early chapters, haiving just had the stroke, and the sheer will power fight  for survival.<br />It got less interesting to me as it proceeded, and I knew  (obviously) that he was going to survive and effect a recovery. So there  was no tension in that sense. I can understand that it may have a lot to  say to people who have been in this situation as victim or carer.<br />Just on  the level of biographical interest it is an average book - hence a 3-star  from me.	2000-03-21
